Department of Defense et al.FacebookTwitterRedditEmailPrintACLU filed suit against numerous federal agencies seeking information related to government preparation for protestors of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Indigenous and environmental activists are preparing to exercise their First Amendment Rights to protest construction of an environmentally damaging pipeline transporting crude oil from Canada to Nebraska. We know that federal, state and local governments are preparing a significant law enforcement response to these protestors. The ACLU filed suit to gain access to information related to government preparations so that protestors will know what to expect when they legitimately exercise their constitutional rights to assemble and speak.Attorney(s)Alex Rate, Lillian Alvernaz, Emerson Sykes, Brett Max KaufmanDate filedSeptember 4, 2018CourtUnited States District Court, District of Montana, Missoula DivisionStatusActiveCase numberCV-18-154Stay informed!
