WyomingFacebookTwitterRedditEmailPrintWe filed an Amicus Brief on behalf of Clayvin Herrera, a Crow tribal member, who was exercising his treaty rights when he hunted elk in the Big Horn National Forest in Wyoming in January 2014. In our Friend of the Court brief, we argued that the United States federal government and the state of Wyoming should uphold treaty rights and affirm tribal sovereignty. In 1868, when the Crow Tribe signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie, ceding roughly 30 million acres of land, they exchanged, in part “the right to hunt on unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon, and as long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts.” Crow tribal members continue to rely on hunting to feed their families.Attorney(s)Alex Rate, Ashley C.
