The purpose of the event is to strategize and advocate for support from Tribal communities to join the movement to end violence against Native LGBTQ2S+ community through positive value-based and community-led education.“We have been holding this event for our Indigenous LGBTQ2S+ youth for the last two years so we can advocate for social change for all our relatives,” says Keioshiah Peter, CSVANW Native Youth Coordinator. “All of our young people deserve to feel safe and to be safe no matter how they identify. We hope to provide a space for our Indigenous LGBTQ2S+ youth feel supported and reenergized at the retreat.”Native youth who identified as LGBTQ are at a heightened risk of experiencing violence, in some instances because families, peers, or communities may not understand or accept their identity. According to the Health and Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth in New Mexico report, 50 percent of New Mexico Native LGBTQ students reported experiencing physical violence at school, 18 percent were three times likely to be forced to have sex or experienced physical dating violence, and one in three reported missing class at least once a month because of bullying.“It is our hope we create a friendly space for our LGBTQ2S+ youth to be themselves and to have fun,” Peter says.The Southwest Butterflies Retreat aims to provide an engaging opportunity for addressing the issues Indigenous LGBTQ2S+ youth face in their communities. Workshops this year are focused on reproductive justice, LGBTQ health, safer sex, and Native Drag.“During the [Southwest Butterflies Retreat], I learned that there are not enough people shedding light on the violence against Native LGBTQ2S+ youth. I also learned that more and more individuals are brave enough to tackle social issues in our community and it is empowering,” says a previous participant of the 2018 Southwest Butterflies Retreat.The Southwest Butterflies Retreat is made possible through generous foundations, community partnerships and sponsorship through the Department of Justice (DOJ), Native American in Philanthropy, and individual donations.For more information on the Southwest Butterflies Retreat, CLICK HERE.Filed Under: News ReleasesAs a tribal coalition, CSVANW does not provide emergency or directs services.If you are in an unsafe situation or need immediate assistance please dial 911.For a safe, confidential way to talk with someone right now, please call:Rape Abuse Incest National Network: 1-800-656-4673 (HOPE)www.rainn.orgNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE)www.ndvh.orgStrong Hearts Native Helpline: 1-844-762-8483www.strongheartshelpline.orgWho Are WeWe focus our work on communities and systems.
