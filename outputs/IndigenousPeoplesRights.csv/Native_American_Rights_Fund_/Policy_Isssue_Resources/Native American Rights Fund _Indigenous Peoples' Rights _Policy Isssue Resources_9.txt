The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an
American treasure that is internationally knownfor its ecological importance, beauty, and wildlife.It is a breathtaking, untouched landscape—oneof very few remaining in the world—and home to37 species of land mammals, 8 marine mammals,42 fish species, and more than 200 migratory birdspecies. Inhabitants include polar bears, caribou,muskox, wolf, moose, mountain sheep, and bow-head whales
While the Refuge is viewed as a vast and remote
wilderness to some, the Gwich’in know it only as“The Sacred Place Where Life Begins.” TheRefuge is part of the ancestral range of theGwitch’in people. The fifteen Gwich’in villagesare some of the most northern indigenous peo-ples of North America. Set back from the coast,the Gwich’in are interior mountain people whodepend heavily on caribou for every aspect of life.The Gwich’in people enjoy a close and lastingrelationship with the caribou, which are a mainsource of subsistence as well as a spiritual andcultural treasure for local communities. Theirculture relies on and honors the caribou and theancestral homelands that have provided for themfor thousands of years. That culture is underthreat.
The Migration & The Coastal Plain
Specifically, Gwich’in communities look to thePorcupine Caribou herd, which migrates annual-ly into and out of the Refuge. The herd of about170,000 animals travels each spring from theirwinter range along the Gwich’in lands to theCoastal Plain where they have spring calving andnursery grounds. It is because of the caribou’smigration that the Refuge is sometimes called the
“American Serengeti.” Nine thousand Gwich’inpeople live near the Porcupine Caribou herd’smigratory path. As they have always done, eachyear, the people await the herd’s return. The cari-bou hunt is central to their way of life. TheGwich’in have worked tirelessly to ensure thatthe Porcupine Caribou are harvested in a sustain-able way and that balance is maintained. Injury tothe caribou is injury to the Gwich’in.

Credit: National Park ServiceAlthough the 19.5-million-acre Refuge covers an
area the size of South Carolina, the 1.5-million-acre Coastal Plain serves as the biological heart ofthe Refuge. In essence, it is the source of thePorcupine Caribou herd. Every spring, the cari-bou migrate to the Coastal Plain where conditionsare less harsh. Being the calving grounds for thePorcupine Caribou herd, the Coastal Plain isknown in the Gwich’in language as Iizhik
Gwats’an Gwandaii Goodlit , “The Sacred Place
Where Life Begins.” It is here that oil and gasdevelopment is proposed. 
Under Threat
For more than 40 years, the oil and gas industry hastried to gain access to the resources under the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge. Native and non-native cit-izens have fought to keep the pristine landscape ofthe Refuge wild. But now, the Trump administrationis making progress towards delivering the refuge totheir friends in the oil and gas industry.
With the help of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski,
the oil and gas industry inserted a provision intothe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allowing theArctic National Wildlife Refuge to be opened to
development. And now, the Trump administrationis bending over backwards to get oil and gas leasesin-hand before the next presidential election.Processes that usually take years—to ensure thatfacts are known and everyone affected by the pro-posed action has a chance to be heard—are beingpushed through in mere months.
In the face of this politicized process, NARF repre-
sents the Native Village of Venetie TribalGovernment, Venetie Village Council, and ArcticVillage Council, three federally recognizedGwich’in tribes working tirelessly to protect theirway of life, secure their cultural preservation, pro-tect their subsistence way of life, and oppose oiland gas development in the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge.
Assessing the Environmental Impact
Congress enacted the legislation opening theArctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gasdevelopment in 2017. The Bureau of LandManagement immediately began the process to

Credit: National Park ServiceVOLUME 44, NO. 1 PAGE 3NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDreview the environmental impacts of oil
and gas development in the area and set apolitical timeline that seeks to completeleasing sales in the region before the nextpresidential election.
In less than a year, the Trump
Administration slapped together anEnvironmental Impact Statement (EIS),based on pre-existing data and researchfrom other regions in Alaska. The draftEIS is far from adequate and does notcomply with legal requirements. It brush-es aside the subsistence and culturalresources of the local tribes. According tothe law, an EIS is supposed to consider allpotential impacts on the environmentand local communities, but this document falls
well-short of that requirement. For example, itdoes not include an adequate analysis of theeffects on the Porcupine Caribou Herd or theGwich’in tribes who depend on them; the analysisfails to include Native knowledge from the peoplemost intimately familiar with the region; and, asit compares outcomes for alternative scenarios, itdoes not even consider the option of NOT open-ing the Coastal Plain to leasing.
The draft goes so far as to boldly declare that oil
and gas development in the caribou calvinggrounds will have no impact on the Tribes’ subsis-tence hunting practices. Even as it acknowledgesthat oil and gas development could change migra-tion patterns and lower calving rates, it’s narrowand incomplete analysis incorrectly concluded thatGwich’in subsistence use would not be affected.Other problems with the draft EIS include:
 The analysis is based on incomplete and outdat-
ed scientific information about the effects ofenergy development on the Coastal Plain. Theagency did not take steps to obtain more infor-mation or even identify the missing informa-tion—both of which are required by law.
 A thorough analysis requires participation of all
affected parties. BLM has not consulted with allof the Gwich’in tribes (as required by law). TheBLM must allow all community members tohave a voice in this process.
 The agency cannot gauge the effects on thePorcupine Caribou Herd without complete and
accurate information. This includes addressinggaps in current Western scientific data andincorporating the traditional knowledge of thepeoples who have practiced subsistence living inthe area since time immemorial.
 The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was estab-
lished in part to conserve wildlife and protectsubsistence uses. If the refuge is opened to oil andgas development, how will those goals be met?
 The Refuge also fulfills US-Canada treaty oblig-
ations related to the conservation of thePorcupine Caribou herd. The agency mustdetail how exactly it will fulfill those treatyobligations if it allows oil and gas developmentin the region.
 The draft statement fails to include the potential
effects of seismic activity of related oil and gasexploration. Seismic exploration is part of theoil and gas development process and should beincluded in the full analysis.
Native Voices
The draft EIS was released on December 20, 2018.The manner in which it was released was a reflec-tion of the lack of respect or care that the admin-istration holds for its tribal counterparts.
“Today’s release was done with no prior notifica-
tion to our Tribal Councils, who have met withthe BLM for months on a government-to-govern-ment basis,” said Native Village of Venetie Tribal
Credit: USFWSGovernment Executive Director Tonya Garnett.
“What’s even more disrespectful is to release thisjust before our villages are gathering together tocelebrate the holidays. The total lack of regard toour tribal governments on an issue of such impor-tance really demonstrates how BLM leadershipviews their trust responsibility to our Tribes. Ourpeople and the caribou are bound together, andtheir fate is the same as ours. We will never stopin the defense of our way of life.”
After the slap-dash Environmental Impact
Statement was released in December 2018, thefederal government was shut down fromDecember 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019.When the federal government did re-open tenta-tively for three weeks, the Bureau scheduled all ofthe required public hearings (seven in Alaska andone in DC) to happen between February 5 andFebruary 13!
And, the “public hearings” were highly unusual.
They consisted of a presentation by the BLM, fol-lowed by a court reporter meeting privately withattendees to record their comments. This uncom-mon procedure served to diminish the force of tes-timony and deflate public discourse. The regulatorsdidn’t want to hear from the people, they wantedthe process done as quickly and quietly as possible. 
Regardless of short notice and tight schedules,
and with funding from NARF supporters, eighttribal representatives traveled from Alaska to DCin February to testify about the importance ofprotecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.And, on March 13, NARF and the Tribes filed writ-ten comments documenting the shortcomings ofthe Environmental Impact Statement.The Fight Continues
Under the National Environmental Policy Act, theBLM must develop and analyze the scientific andtechnical data required for permit approval.Within this process, tribal governments have theability to become “cooperating agencies” and sit atthe decision-making table as any other govern-ment agency would. This process allows tribes tosubmit scientific and technical data and not haveto rely solely on the lead agency to supply therequired data. NARF is working with tribal andtechnical experts who specialize in the Arctic envi-ronment to fully represent the Gwich’in interests.
Under the National Historic Preservation Act, the
BLM must analyze the impacts oil and gas devel-opment will have on “historic properties,” includ-ing places of cultural and religious significance.The BLM must consult with affected tribes, whichcan be a powerful platform and tool to advocatefor the protection of cultural, religious, and his-toric important places and landscapes connectedto the Refuge. This process will continue into thesummer and NARF is negotiating on behalf of ourtribal clients. 
Over the years, the Gwich’in have steadfastly
maintained their culture, identity, and integrityas traditional indigenous inhabitants of the areaaround and including the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge. They maintain sacred relationships to theland and caribou. Since time immemorial, theGwich’in have preserved this special place forfuture generations. The Gwich’in tribes will con-tinue to fight to protect their home and theNative American Rights Fund is proud to be bytheir side.

In 2007, after decades of advocacy by indigenous
peoples, the UN General Assembly adopted theDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.The Declaration acknowledges indigenous peo-ples’ rights to self-determination, equality, prop-erty, culture, and other human rights.
According to CU Law School Dean James Anaya: 
“The Declaration envisions a future in which
the countries of the world embrace and upliftindigenous peoples on fair and equitableterms with effective recognition of theirrights to exist as distinct peoples in harmonywith the societies that have grown up aroundthem, free from social and economic dispari-ties rooted in histories of mistreatment.” 
The Declaration can be an impetus for change,
but it is only a framework. Implementation willrequire sustained effort. Laws and policies mustchange to fulfill the Declaration’s promises. Tothat end, the University of Colorado Law School(CU) and NARF created the Project to Implementthe UN Declaration on the Rights of IndigenousPeoples in the United States.
Implementing the Declaration
The first program of the CU/NARFProject to Implement the Declarationwas held in March. CU and NARForganized a two-day conference onthe UN Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples. Scholars, advo-cates, and legal practitioners dis-cussed how to advance theDeclaration and strategies for imple-menting it in the United States. 
The conference allowed initial strategic
planning for how the Declaration’saspirations can be turned into realityin the United States. NARF Executive Director
John Echohawk explained that:
“[The Declaration] has language in there that
basically supports everything we’re trying todo in our advocacy work – in the courts, in theCongress, in the administration and agencies.There’s something in the Declaration that sup-ports everything we are trying to do. So weneed to wrap up that effort and utilize theDeclaration more in support of our advocacywork. That’s the main purpose why we are hereat this conference, is to refine those strategiesand find better ways to use the Declaration tomake a difference…”
The conference included discussions on chal-
lenges in Federal Indian Law, the role of interna-tional human rights in advocacy efforts, culturalrights, climate change and environmental advo-cacy, business and entrepreneurship, Indian childwelfare, as well as technology and communica-tions.
Recordings of the conference sessions are avail-
able from the NARF YouTube channel.

most important, far-reaching issues currentlybeing addressed in America. It also is a keystone ofNARF’s work. Only with a functioning democracyare we able to address issues of Native Americancivil rights, equity, and social justice. 
The past decade has seen repeated attacks on voter
protections. Voter access, required for a truedemocracy, has become politicized. When theVoting Rights Act was reauthorized in 2006, itpassed easily. According to NARF Staff AttorneyNatalie Landreth who testified during that legisla-tive process, “Support for VRA Reauthorizationwas wide and nonpartisan, Republicans by andlarge didn’t vote against it, it passed somethinglike 96-0. Now Sen. Mitch McConnell is suggestingthat the H.R. 1 and other voting bills won’t evenmake it to the Senate floor? The conversationaround voting has degenerated so far in so littletime.” Protecting our citizens’ voices should be apriority for all of us. It is a non-partisan issue anda basic tenet of a functioning democracy.
However, since 2010, 25 states have passed laws
restricting the vote. The discriminatory voter IDlaws NARF has been challenging in North Dakotagained wide-spread attention during the 2018elections, but North Dakota was not an isolatedincident. In 2016, 14 states had new restrictivevoting laws in place. In 2018, six states had newlaws. 
1And obstacles like these are often magnified
in Native communities where geographic andtechnological isolation, poverty, non-traditionalmailing addresses, and deep-rooted racism cancompound efforts to stifle democratic access.
Addressing these issues is a top priority for NARF .
In 2015, NARF started the Native AmericanVoting Rights Coalition, which coordinatesefforts to overcome voting barriers NativeAmericans face. NAVRC’s first actions included amulti-state survey and nine field hearings acrossIndian Country to better identify and understandthe obstacles that Native Americans face inaccessing the ballot box. You can read moreabout their findings at the NAVRC website(https://vote.narf.org/). These outreach effortsidentified numerous ways that Native American
political participation is being suppressed.
Armed with those findings, NARF is working with
legislators at the state and federal level to raiseawareness about systemic problems and encour-age legislation to combat them. At the federallevel, legislation such as HR1 and the NativeAmerican Voting Rights Act are under considera-tion and development. NARF attorneys work toeducate legislators about problems that afflictNative American communities. We will be moni-toring these bills’ progress.
At the state level, a number of actions are under-
way, but we are most heartened by the WashingtonState Senate, which recently passed a NativeAmerican Voting Rights Act. Washington SenatorJohn McCoy (Tulalip) explains, “Our democracyworks best when we all have the opportunity toparticipate. When entire communities are deniedaccess to the ballot box, lawmakers need to take alook at systemic issues that need to be addressed.” 
In January, NARF Staff Attorney Jacqueline De
León appeared before the Washington StateSenate to talk about obstacles to political partici-pation in Indian Country. Soon after giving thattestimony, De León also was a guest on Native
America Calling , talking about Native voting
rights. You can listen to that show at(http://www.nativeamericacalling.com/tuesday-february-5-2019-protecting-native-voting-rights/).
With significant work still to be done, this fight is
on-going. However, the legislative efforts under-way are a chance for progress. You can be a part ofensuring the security of our democracy.

Rights Act. Contact your representatives(https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) and letthem know that voting rights and democracyreform are a top priority for you.

Indian Law Cases Decided By the Supreme CourtHerrera v. Wyoming (17-532) – On May 20,
2019, the Court ruled in favor of Clayvin Herrera,a Crow Tribe member, in an off-reservation treatyhunting rights case. The majority opinion wasauthored by Justice Sotomayor and joined byJustices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Gorsuch.Justice Alito authored a dissenting opinion,which was joined by Chief Justice Roberts andJustices Thomas and Kavanaugh. 
Mr. Herrera challenged his Wyoming state court
conviction for unlawfully hunting elk in theBighorn National Forest. The Crow Tribe’s 1868treaty with the United States reserves huntingrights in ceded lands, which includes what is nowthe Bighorn National Forest, so long as thoselands remain “unoccupied.” However, the statecourt did not allow Mr. Herrera to assert theTribe’s treaty hunting right as a bar to prosecu-tion, instead holding that Wyoming’s admissionto the Union abrogated the Tribe’s treaty huntingright, and the creation of the Bighorn NationalForest constituted an “occupation” of thoselands. A state appellate court affirmed, and theWyoming Supreme Court denied review. 
Justice Sotomayor’s majority opinion said thatMinnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa
Indians, 526 U.S. 172 (1999) “established that the
crucial inquiry for treaty termination analysis iswhether Congress has expressly abrogated anIndian treaty right or whether a terminationpoint identified in the treaty itself has been satis-fied.” The opinion went on to say that statehoodis irrelevant to this analysis, unless a statehoodact demonstrates a clear intent to abrogate atreaty or appears as a termination point in thetreaty itself. The Court held that neither theWyoming’s statehood act nor the Treaty of 1868evidenced clear Congressional intent for thetribe’s treaty hunting right to terminate. 
The Court also rejected the lower court’s alterna-
tive holding that the land became entirely “occu-pied” through the creation of the BighornNational Forest. However, on remand, the Courtleft open the door for Wyoming to establish thatthe specific site where Mr. Herrera hunted wasused in a manner rendering it “occupied” withinthe treaty’s meaning. Similarly, the Court statedthat Wyoming could, on remand, “press its argu-ments as to why the application of state conserva-tion regulations to Crow tribal members exercis-ing their off-reservation treaty hunting rights arenecessary for conservation.” The Court’s opinionis available at: https://sct.narf.org/documents/herrera_v_wyoming/opinion.pdf. 
Washington State Department of Licensing v.
Cougar Den (16-1498) – On March 19, 2019, the
Court affirmed the Washington Supreme Court’sdecision in favor of Cougar Den, a businessowned by a Yakama Nation tribal member. In thiscase, the Washington State Department ofLicensing (Department) sought reversal of a
TRIBAL SUPREME COURT PROJECT
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDWashington Supreme Court decision, which held
that the right-to-travel provision of the YakamaNation Treaty of 1855 preempts the Department’simposition of taxes and licensing requirementson a tribally chartered corporation that trans-ports motor fuel across state lines for sale on theReservation.
The Court issued a plurality opinion written by
Justice Breyer (joined by Justices Sotomayor andKagan). The plurality opinion first reasons thatthe incidence of the tax is a matter of state law,and the Washington Supreme Court determinedthat the tax is imposed on the “importation offuel, which is the transportation of fuel” and that“travel on public highways is directly at issuebecause the tax [is] an importation tax.”Additionally, the opinion concludes that thestatute, regardless of how one construes it, hasthe practical effect of being a charge assessed toYakamas who exercise their treaty right. 
In holding that the tax was accordingly pre-empt-
ed by the Yakama’s treaty, Justice Breyer empha-sized that each of the four times the Court hasexamined this treaty, it has stressed the impor-tance of reading the treaty language as theYakamas would have understood it in 1855.Reading the treaty in this way, Justice Breyerrejects the argument that the treaty’s languageguaranteeing travel on highways “in commonwith citizens of the United States” permits theequal application of general legislation toYakamas and non-Yakamas alike. Moreover,Justice Breyer found it important that the histor-ical record in this case demonstrated that theright to travel includes a right to travel with goodsfor sale. Therefore, this tax, which burdens theright to travel with goods, must be pre-empted. 
There were three additional opinions: Justice
Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion, which wasjoined by Justice Ginsburg; Chief Justice Robertswrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined byJustices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh; andJustice Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion,which was joined by Justice Thomas. The opin-ions are available at: https://sct.narf.org/docu-ments/washington_v_cougar_den/opinion.pdfPetitions for a Writ of Certiorari Granted
The Court has granted review in one Indian lawcase that has not been decided by the Court:
Carpenter v. Murphy (17-1107) – On May 21,
2018, the Court granted a petition filed by theState of Oklahoma seeking review of a US TenthCircuit Court of Appeals decision in a habeas corpus
action, which reversed the District Court andheld that the State of Oklahoma was withoutjurisdiction to prosecute and convict a memberof the Muscogee (Creek) Nation because thecrime for which he was convicted occurred inIndian country, within the boundaries of theMuscogee (Creek) Reservation. After Mr. Murphywas convicted of murder in Oklahoma state courtand exhausted his appeals, he filed a habeas corpus
petition in federal district court asserting that,because the crime occurred within the Muscogee(Creek) Nation’s reservation boundaries andbecause he is Indian, the state court had no juris-diction. The federal district court denied his peti-tion, holding that Oklahoma possessed jurisdic-tion because the Muscogee (Creek) Reservationwas disestablished. On appeal, the Tenth CircuitCourt used the three-factor Solem reservationdisestablishment analysis and not only found thatCongress did not disestablish the Muscogee(Creek) Reservation, but also that statutes andallotment agreements showed that “Congressrecognized the existence of the Creek Nation’sborders.” Likewise, the court held that the histor-ical evidence indicated neither a congressionalintent to disestablish the Muscogee (Creek) reser-vation, nor a contemporaneous understanding byCongress that it had disestablished the reserva-tion. Accordingly, the court concluded that (1)Mr. Murphy’s state conviction and death sentencewere invalid because the crime occurred inIndian Country and the accused was Indian, (2)the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA)erred by concluding the state courts had jurisdic-tion, and (3) the federal district court erred byconcluding the OCCA’s decision was not contraryto clearly established federal law. The Courtheard oral argument on November 27, 2018, and,on December 4, 2018, the Court ordered supple-mental briefing. All supplemental briefs havebeen filed.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious free-dom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishingrights, as well as basic human and civil rights. We contin-ue to take on complex, time-consuming cases that othersavoid, such as government accountability, climate change,and the education of our children. We have assisted morethan 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go to theheart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian
rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty. An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work protects tribal natural
resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority to promote human
rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that
protect the rights of Native Americans to practice theirtraditional religion, use their languages, and enjoy theirculture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peo-ples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspect oftribal life, NARF is committed to actions that hold govern-
ments accountable to Native Americans.
To protect Indian rights, we must develop Indian Law
and educate the public about Indian rights, laws andissues. This includes establishing favorable court prece-
dents, distributing information and law materials, encour-aging and fostering Indian legal education, and formingalliances with Indian law practitioners and other Indianorganizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an
American treasure that is internationally knownfor its ecological importance, beauty, and wildlife.It is a breathtaking, untouched landscape—oneof very few remaining in the world—and home to37 species of land mammals, 8 marine mammals,42 fish species, and more than 200 migratory birdspecies. Inhabitants include polar bears, caribou,muskox, wolf, moose, mountain sheep, and bow-head whales
While the Refuge is viewed as a vast and remote
wilderness to some, the Gwich’in know it only as“The Sacred Place Where Life Begins.” TheRefuge is part of the ancestral range of theGwitch’in people. The fifteen Gwich’in villagesare some of the most northern indigenous peo-ples of North America. Set back from the coast,the Gwich’in are interior mountain people whodepend heavily on caribou for every aspect of life.The Gwich’in people enjoy a close and lastingrelationship with the caribou, which are a mainsource of subsistence as well as a spiritual andcultural treasure for local communities. Theirculture relies on and honors the caribou and theancestral homelands that have provided for themfor thousands of years. That culture is underthreat.
The Migration & The Coastal Plain
Specifically, Gwich’in communities look to thePorcupine Caribou herd, which migrates annual-ly into and out of the Refuge. The herd of about170,000 animals travels each spring from theirwinter range along the Gwich’in lands to theCoastal Plain where they have spring calving andnursery grounds. It is because of the caribou’smigration that the Refuge is sometimes called the
“American Serengeti.” Nine thousand Gwich’inpeople live near the Porcupine Caribou herd’smigratory path. As they have always done, eachyear, the people await the herd’s return. The cari-bou hunt is central to their way of life. TheGwich’in have worked tirelessly to ensure thatthe Porcupine Caribou are harvested in a sustain-able way and that balance is maintained. Injury tothe caribou is injury to the Gwich’in.

Credit: National Park ServiceAlthough the 19.5-million-acre Refuge covers an
area the size of South Carolina, the 1.5-million-acre Coastal Plain serves as the biological heart ofthe Refuge. In essence, it is the source of thePorcupine Caribou herd. Every spring, the cari-bou migrate to the Coastal Plain where conditionsare less harsh. Being the calving grounds for thePorcupine Caribou herd, the Coastal Plain isknown in the Gwich’in language as Iizhik
Gwats’an Gwandaii Goodlit , “The Sacred Place
Where Life Begins.” It is here that oil and gasdevelopment is proposed. 
Under Threat
For more than 40 years, the oil and gas industry hastried to gain access to the resources under the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge. Native and non-native cit-izens have fought to keep the pristine landscape ofthe Refuge wild. But now, the Trump administrationis making progress towards delivering the refuge totheir friends in the oil and gas industry.
With the help of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski,
the oil and gas industry inserted a provision intothe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allowing theArctic National Wildlife Refuge to be opened to
development. And now, the Trump administrationis bending over backwards to get oil and gas leasesin-hand before the next presidential election.Processes that usually take years—to ensure thatfacts are known and everyone affected by the pro-posed action has a chance to be heard—are beingpushed through in mere months.
In the face of this politicized process, NARF repre-
sents the Native Village of Venetie TribalGovernment, Venetie Village Council, and ArcticVillage Council, three federally recognizedGwich’in tribes working tirelessly to protect theirway of life, secure their cultural preservation, pro-tect their subsistence way of life, and oppose oiland gas development in the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge.
Assessing the Environmental Impact
Congress enacted the legislation opening theArctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gasdevelopment in 2017. The Bureau of LandManagement immediately began the process to

Credit: National Park ServiceVOLUME 44, NO. 1 PAGE 3NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDreview the environmental impacts of oil
and gas development in the area and set apolitical timeline that seeks to completeleasing sales in the region before the nextpresidential election.
In less than a year, the Trump
Administration slapped together anEnvironmental Impact Statement (EIS),based on pre-existing data and researchfrom other regions in Alaska. The draftEIS is far from adequate and does notcomply with legal requirements. It brush-es aside the subsistence and culturalresources of the local tribes. According tothe law, an EIS is supposed to consider allpotential impacts on the environmentand local communities, but this document falls
well-short of that requirement. For example, itdoes not include an adequate analysis of theeffects on the Porcupine Caribou Herd or theGwich’in tribes who depend on them; the analysisfails to include Native knowledge from the peoplemost intimately familiar with the region; and, asit compares outcomes for alternative scenarios, itdoes not even consider the option of NOT open-ing the Coastal Plain to leasing.
The draft goes so far as to boldly declare that oil
and gas development in the caribou calvinggrounds will have no impact on the Tribes’ subsis-tence hunting practices. Even as it acknowledgesthat oil and gas development could change migra-tion patterns and lower calving rates, it’s narrowand incomplete analysis incorrectly concluded thatGwich’in subsistence use would not be affected.Other problems with the draft EIS include:
 The analysis is based on incomplete and outdat-
ed scientific information about the effects ofenergy development on the Coastal Plain. Theagency did not take steps to obtain more infor-mation or even identify the missing informa-tion—both of which are required by law.
 A thorough analysis requires participation of all
affected parties. BLM has not consulted with allof the Gwich’in tribes (as required by law). TheBLM must allow all community members tohave a voice in this process.
 The agency cannot gauge the effects on thePorcupine Caribou Herd without complete and
accurate information. This includes addressinggaps in current Western scientific data andincorporating the traditional knowledge of thepeoples who have practiced subsistence living inthe area since time immemorial.
 The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was estab-
lished in part to conserve wildlife and protectsubsistence uses. If the refuge is opened to oil andgas development, how will those goals be met?
 The Refuge also fulfills US-Canada treaty oblig-
ations related to the conservation of thePorcupine Caribou herd. The agency mustdetail how exactly it will fulfill those treatyobligations if it allows oil and gas developmentin the region.
 The draft statement fails to include the potential
effects of seismic activity of related oil and gasexploration. Seismic exploration is part of theoil and gas development process and should beincluded in the full analysis.
Native Voices
The draft EIS was released on December 20, 2018.The manner in which it was released was a reflec-tion of the lack of respect or care that the admin-istration holds for its tribal counterparts.
“Today’s release was done with no prior notifica-
tion to our Tribal Councils, who have met withthe BLM for months on a government-to-govern-ment basis,” said Native Village of Venetie Tribal
Credit: USFWSGovernment Executive Director Tonya Garnett.
“What’s even more disrespectful is to release thisjust before our villages are gathering together tocelebrate the holidays. The total lack of regard toour tribal governments on an issue of such impor-tance really demonstrates how BLM leadershipviews their trust responsibility to our Tribes. Ourpeople and the caribou are bound together, andtheir fate is the same as ours. We will never stopin the defense of our way of life.”
After the slap-dash Environmental Impact
Statement was released in December 2018, thefederal government was shut down fromDecember 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019.When the federal government did re-open tenta-tively for three weeks, the Bureau scheduled all ofthe required public hearings (seven in Alaska andone in DC) to happen between February 5 andFebruary 13!
And, the “public hearings” were highly unusual.
They consisted of a presentation by the BLM, fol-lowed by a court reporter meeting privately withattendees to record their comments. This uncom-mon procedure served to diminish the force of tes-timony and deflate public discourse. The regulatorsdidn’t want to hear from the people, they wantedthe process done as quickly and quietly as possible. 
Regardless of short notice and tight schedules,
and with funding from NARF supporters, eighttribal representatives traveled from Alaska to DCin February to testify about the importance ofprotecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.And, on March 13, NARF and the Tribes filed writ-ten comments documenting the shortcomings ofthe Environmental Impact Statement.The Fight Continues
Under the National Environmental Policy Act, theBLM must develop and analyze the scientific andtechnical data required for permit approval.Within this process, tribal governments have theability to become “cooperating agencies” and sit atthe decision-making table as any other govern-ment agency would. This process allows tribes tosubmit scientific and technical data and not haveto rely solely on the lead agency to supply therequired data. NARF is working with tribal andtechnical experts who specialize in the Arctic envi-ronment to fully represent the Gwich’in interests.
Under the National Historic Preservation Act, the
BLM must analyze the impacts oil and gas devel-opment will have on “historic properties,” includ-ing places of cultural and religious significance.The BLM must consult with affected tribes, whichcan be a powerful platform and tool to advocatefor the protection of cultural, religious, and his-toric important places and landscapes connectedto the Refuge. This process will continue into thesummer and NARF is negotiating on behalf of ourtribal clients. 
Over the years, the Gwich’in have steadfastly
maintained their culture, identity, and integrityas traditional indigenous inhabitants of the areaaround and including the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge. They maintain sacred relationships to theland and caribou. Since time immemorial, theGwich’in have preserved this special place forfuture generations. The Gwich’in tribes will con-tinue to fight to protect their home and theNative American Rights Fund is proud to be bytheir side.

In 2007, after decades of advocacy by indigenous
peoples, the UN General Assembly adopted theDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.The Declaration acknowledges indigenous peo-ples’ rights to self-determination, equality, prop-erty, culture, and other human rights.
According to CU Law School Dean James Anaya: 
“The Declaration envisions a future in which
the countries of the world embrace and upliftindigenous peoples on fair and equitableterms with effective recognition of theirrights to exist as distinct peoples in harmonywith the societies that have grown up aroundthem, free from social and economic dispari-ties rooted in histories of mistreatment.” 
The Declaration can be an impetus for change,
but it is only a framework. Implementation willrequire sustained effort. Laws and policies mustchange to fulfill the Declaration’s promises. Tothat end, the University of Colorado Law School(CU) and NARF created the Project to Implementthe UN Declaration on the Rights of IndigenousPeoples in the United States.
Implementing the Declaration
The first program of the CU/NARFProject to Implement the Declarationwas held in March. CU and NARForganized a two-day conference onthe UN Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples. Scholars, advo-cates, and legal practitioners dis-cussed how to advance theDeclaration and strategies for imple-menting it in the United States. 
The conference allowed initial strategic
planning for how the Declaration’saspirations can be turned into realityin the United States. NARF Executive Director
John Echohawk explained that:
“[The Declaration] has language in there that
basically supports everything we’re trying todo in our advocacy work – in the courts, in theCongress, in the administration and agencies.There’s something in the Declaration that sup-ports everything we are trying to do. So weneed to wrap up that effort and utilize theDeclaration more in support of our advocacywork. That’s the main purpose why we are hereat this conference, is to refine those strategiesand find better ways to use the Declaration tomake a difference…”
The conference included discussions on chal-
lenges in Federal Indian Law, the role of interna-tional human rights in advocacy efforts, culturalrights, climate change and environmental advo-cacy, business and entrepreneurship, Indian childwelfare, as well as technology and communica-tions.
Recordings of the conference sessions are avail-
able from the NARF YouTube channel.

most important, far-reaching issues currentlybeing addressed in America. It also is a keystone ofNARF’s work. Only with a functioning democracyare we able to address issues of Native Americancivil rights, equity, and social justice. 
The past decade has seen repeated attacks on voter
protections. Voter access, required for a truedemocracy, has become politicized. When theVoting Rights Act was reauthorized in 2006, itpassed easily. According to NARF Staff AttorneyNatalie Landreth who testified during that legisla-tive process, “Support for VRA Reauthorizationwas wide and nonpartisan, Republicans by andlarge didn’t vote against it, it passed somethinglike 96-0. Now Sen. Mitch McConnell is suggestingthat the H.R. 1 and other voting bills won’t evenmake it to the Senate floor? The conversationaround voting has degenerated so far in so littletime.” Protecting our citizens’ voices should be apriority for all of us. It is a non-partisan issue anda basic tenet of a functioning democracy.
However, since 2010, 25 states have passed laws
restricting the vote. The discriminatory voter IDlaws NARF has been challenging in North Dakotagained wide-spread attention during the 2018elections, but North Dakota was not an isolatedincident. In 2016, 14 states had new restrictivevoting laws in place. In 2018, six states had newlaws. 
1And obstacles like these are often magnified
in Native communities where geographic andtechnological isolation, poverty, non-traditionalmailing addresses, and deep-rooted racism cancompound efforts to stifle democratic access.
Addressing these issues is a top priority for NARF .
In 2015, NARF started the Native AmericanVoting Rights Coalition, which coordinatesefforts to overcome voting barriers NativeAmericans face. NAVRC’s first actions included amulti-state survey and nine field hearings acrossIndian Country to better identify and understandthe obstacles that Native Americans face inaccessing the ballot box. You can read moreabout their findings at the NAVRC website(https://vote.narf.org/). These outreach effortsidentified numerous ways that Native American
political participation is being suppressed.
Armed with those findings, NARF is working with
legislators at the state and federal level to raiseawareness about systemic problems and encour-age legislation to combat them. At the federallevel, legislation such as HR1 and the NativeAmerican Voting Rights Act are under considera-tion and development. NARF attorneys work toeducate legislators about problems that afflictNative American communities. We will be moni-toring these bills’ progress.
At the state level, a number of actions are under-
way, but we are most heartened by the WashingtonState Senate, which recently passed a NativeAmerican Voting Rights Act. Washington SenatorJohn McCoy (Tulalip) explains, “Our democracyworks best when we all have the opportunity toparticipate. When entire communities are deniedaccess to the ballot box, lawmakers need to take alook at systemic issues that need to be addressed.” 
In January, NARF Staff Attorney Jacqueline De
León appeared before the Washington StateSenate to talk about obstacles to political partici-pation in Indian Country. Soon after giving thattestimony, De León also was a guest on Native
America Calling , talking about Native voting
rights. You can listen to that show at(http://www.nativeamericacalling.com/tuesday-february-5-2019-protecting-native-voting-rights/).
With significant work still to be done, this fight is
on-going. However, the legislative efforts under-way are a chance for progress. You can be a part ofensuring the security of our democracy. 
Take action to support the Native American Voting
Rights Act. Contact your representatives(https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) and letthem know that voting rights and democracyreform are a top priority for you.

Indian Law Cases Decided By the Supreme CourtHerrera v. Wyoming (17-532) – On May 20,
2019, the Court ruled in favor of Clayvin Herrera,a Crow Tribe member, in an off-reservation treatyhunting rights case. The majority opinion wasauthored by Justice Sotomayor and joined byJustices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Gorsuch.Justice Alito authored a dissenting opinion,which was joined by Chief Justice Roberts andJustices Thomas and Kavanaugh. 
Mr. Herrera challenged his Wyoming state court
conviction for unlawfully hunting elk in theBighorn National Forest. The Crow Tribe’s 1868treaty with the United States reserves huntingrights in ceded lands, which includes what is nowthe Bighorn National Forest, so long as thoselands remain “unoccupied.” However, the statecourt did not allow Mr. Herrera to assert theTribe’s treaty hunting right as a bar to prosecu-tion, instead holding that Wyoming’s admissionto the Union abrogated the Tribe’s treaty huntingright, and the creation of the Bighorn NationalForest constituted an “occupation” of thoselands. A state appellate court affirmed, and theWyoming Supreme Court denied review. 
Justice Sotomayor’s majority opinion said thatMinnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa
Indians, 526 U.S. 172 (1999) “established that the
crucial inquiry for treaty termination analysis iswhether Congress has expressly abrogated anIndian treaty right or whether a terminationpoint identified in the treaty itself has been satis-fied.” The opinion went on to say that statehoodis irrelevant to this analysis, unless a statehoodact demonstrates a clear intent to abrogate atreaty or appears as a termination point in thetreaty itself. The Court held that neither theWyoming’s statehood act nor the Treaty of 1868evidenced clear Congressional intent for thetribe’s treaty hunting right to terminate. 
The Court also rejected the lower court’s alterna-
tive holding that the land became entirely “occu-pied” through the creation of the BighornNational Forest. However, on remand, the Courtleft open the door for Wyoming to establish thatthe specific site where Mr. Herrera hunted wasused in a manner rendering it “occupied” withinthe treaty’s meaning. Similarly, the Court statedthat Wyoming could, on remand, “press its argu-ments as to why the application of state conserva-tion regulations to Crow tribal members exercis-ing their off-reservation treaty hunting rights arenecessary for conservation.” The Court’s opinionis available at: https://sct.narf.org/documents/herrera_v_wyoming/opinion.pdf. 
Washington State Department of Licensing v.
Cougar Den (16-1498) – On March 19, 2019, the
Court affirmed the Washington Supreme Court’sdecision in favor of Cougar Den, a businessowned by a Yakama Nation tribal member. In thiscase, the Washington State Department ofLicensing (Department) sought reversal of a
TRIBAL SUPREME COURT PROJECT
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDWashington Supreme Court decision, which held
that the right-to-travel provision of the YakamaNation Treaty of 1855 preempts the Department’simposition of taxes and licensing requirementson a tribally chartered corporation that trans-ports motor fuel across state lines for sale on theReservation.
The Court issued a plurality opinion written by
Justice Breyer (joined by Justices Sotomayor andKagan). The plurality opinion first reasons thatthe incidence of the tax is a matter of state law,and the Washington Supreme Court determinedthat the tax is imposed on the “importation offuel, which is the transportation of fuel” and that“travel on public highways is directly at issuebecause the tax [is] an importation tax.”Additionally, the opinion concludes that thestatute, regardless of how one construes it, hasthe practical effect of being a charge assessed toYakamas who exercise their treaty right. 
In holding that the tax was accordingly pre-empt-
ed by the Yakama’s treaty, Justice Breyer empha-sized that each of the four times the Court hasexamined this treaty, it has stressed the impor-tance of reading the treaty language as theYakamas would have understood it in 1855.Reading the treaty in this way, Justice Breyerrejects the argument that the treaty’s languageguaranteeing travel on highways “in commonwith citizens of the United States” permits theequal application of general legislation toYakamas and non-Yakamas alike. Moreover,Justice Breyer found it important that the histor-ical record in this case demonstrated that theright to travel includes a right to travel with goodsfor sale. Therefore, this tax, which burdens theright to travel with goods, must be pre-empted. 
There were three additional opinions: Justice
Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion, which wasjoined by Justice Ginsburg; Chief Justice Robertswrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined byJustices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh; andJustice Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion,which was joined by Justice Thomas. The opin-ions are available at: https://sct.narf.org/docu-ments/washington_v_cougar_den/opinion.pdfPetitions for a Writ of Certiorari Granted
The Court has granted review in one Indian lawcase that has not been decided by the Court:
Carpenter v. Murphy (17-1107) – On May 21,
2018, the Court granted a petition filed by theState of Oklahoma seeking review of a US TenthCircuit Court of Appeals decision in a habeas corpus
action, which reversed the District Court andheld that the State of Oklahoma was withoutjurisdiction to prosecute and convict a memberof the Muscogee (Creek) Nation because thecrime for which he was convicted occurred inIndian country, within the boundaries of theMuscogee (Creek) Reservation. After Mr. Murphywas convicted of murder in Oklahoma state courtand exhausted his appeals, he filed a habeas corpus
petition in federal district court asserting that,because the crime occurred within the Muscogee(Creek) Nation’s reservation boundaries andbecause he is Indian, the state court had no juris-diction. The federal district court denied his peti-tion, holding that Oklahoma possessed jurisdic-tion because the Muscogee (Creek) Reservationwas disestablished. On appeal, the Tenth CircuitCourt used the three-factor Solem reservationdisestablishment analysis and not only found thatCongress did not disestablish the Muscogee(Creek) Reservation, but also that statutes andallotment agreements showed that “Congressrecognized the existence of the Creek Nation’sborders.” Likewise, the court held that the histor-ical evidence indicated neither a congressionalintent to disestablish the Muscogee (Creek) reser-vation, nor a contemporaneous understanding byCongress that it had disestablished the reserva-tion. Accordingly, the court concluded that (1)Mr. Murphy’s state conviction and death sentencewere invalid because the crime occurred inIndian Country and the accused was Indian, (2)the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA)erred by concluding the state courts had jurisdic-tion, and (3) the federal district court erred byconcluding the OCCA’s decision was not contraryto clearly established federal law. The Courtheard oral argument on November 27, 2018, and,on December 4, 2018, the Court ordered supple-mental briefing. All supplemental briefs havebeen filed.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious free-dom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishingrights, as well as basic human and civil rights. We contin-ue to take on complex, time-consuming cases that othersavoid, such as government accountability, climate change,and the education of our children. We have assisted morethan 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go to theheart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian
rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty. An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work protects tribal natural
resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority to promote human
rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that
protect the rights of Native Americans to practice theirtraditional religion, use their languages, and enjoy theirculture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peo-ples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspect oftribal life, NARF is committed to actions that hold govern-
ments accountable to Native Americans.
To protect Indian rights, we must develop Indian Law
and educate the public about Indian rights, laws andissues. This includes establishing favorable court prece-
dents, distributing information and law materials, encour-aging and fostering Indian legal education, and formingalliances with Indian law practitioners and other Indianorganizations.
