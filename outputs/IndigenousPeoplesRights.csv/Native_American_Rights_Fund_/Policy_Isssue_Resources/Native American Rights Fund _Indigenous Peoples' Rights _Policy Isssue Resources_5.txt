Every ten years, the
United States holdsa Census to deter-mine how manypeople live in theUnited States andits territories. Onething that we dowith that popula-tion information isto divide the nation
into voting districts. That process is known asredistricting. Redistricting is the redrawing ofpolitical boundaries for election districts for theUS House of Representatives, state legislatures,county commissioners, city councils, schoolboards, and other local bodies. 
Having equal numbers of voters in each of a
state’s voting district protects the constitutionalright to have a vote that is equal to any other per-son’s vote. Thus, under the Constitution, a statemust ensure that its districts each have approxi-mately the same number of people. By redrawingthe lines every ten years, the government canmake changes to district boundaries based onwhere people have moved or where populationshave grown or shrunk. This often over-lookedprocess is essential for protecting our civil rightsand political strength. Without these periodicadjustments, the voting power of a particularcommunity can become diluted over time. 
In addition to preserving equal representation,
how officials define boundaries during the redis-tricting process is important. The way people aregrouped into districts has an immense influenceon who our representatives are and what policiesthey fight for. Voting districts control access to
political representation. Changing districtboundaries can change the political agency of thepeople therein. It is crucial that Native
Americans and Alaska Natives have an equalvoice in redistricting, to protect the ability ofNative voters to elect candidates of their choiceand protect their political power. The Native
American Rights Fund is providing educationand resources to make sure that Native commu-nities are prepared to effectively participate inthe 2021 redistricting process.
Redistricting Effects and Limitations
The United States Supreme Court started themodern era of redistricting in the 1960s. TheCourt’s rulings during this time were intended toaddress issues like the rural-urban tension andracial discrimination. Prior to the SupremeCourt rulings, some states across the countryhad not redistricted for decades. It was a way tomaintain existing power structures. 
During the first half of the 20th century, many
states resisted redistricting, and voting districtsoften became markedly unequal as populationsshifted from one region to another. Political

boundaries were not redrawn and districts were
increasingly unequal in size and equity. Forexample, one state legislator might represent45,000 people, while another only represented20,000. The people in the smaller district wouldhave disproportionately more representation,making the system unfair. 
The Supreme Court ended that practice by finding
that the US Constitution required equal popula-tions for state and federal legislative seats (exceptthe US Senate seats). They required states toredistrict every ten years, after the national censuswas completed.
After the Court required redistricting and equal
districts, partisans shifted efforts. Instead ofresisting redistricting entirely, they envisionedways to work within the Court’s requirements,but still give their interest group the most seats
and political representation that they could. In order to do this, organizers ignored obviouscommunity boundaries and instead createdboundaries that moved blocks of voters betweendistricts in a way that created an advantage fortheir own interest group.
Gerrymandering
Those undemocratic efforts paid off. It soonbecame clear that, even when districts have nearlyequal populations, a map can still limit a certaingroup’s political power. This abuse of redistrictingis called gerrymandering. Often it is used toexclude communities from political power com-pletely. 
District lines often dilute votes in two ways. First,
district lines can “crack” minority voters into
PAGE 2                                                                           NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDVOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 3NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDmany districts, where they are a
small percentage of the popula-tion in each. This leaves themunable to elect their representa-tive of choice, despite havingenough votes to do so if theywere grouped together in a dis-trict. In the image on the previ-ous page, gray voters have beencracked in the third map, leav-ing them without control of anydistricts, even though they represent forty percent of thepopulation. In the alternative, amap might “pack” minority voters into one district, whenthey would have more politicalpower if they were spread out inmultiple districts. In the fourthmap, most of the blue votershave been packed into two districts. The rest of the bluevoters have been cracked up inthe other districts. This leaves the blue voterswith forty percent of the districts, even thoughthey are sixty percent of the population. 
When voters are unfairly “packed” or “cracked,”
even turning out every eligible voter may not beenough to win an election. This is why redistrictingis so important. 
In order to prevent racial gerrymandering, it is
necessary for Native Americans to advocate fortheir communities in the redistricting process.This is our chance to create a fair system that willstay in place for the next ten years. 
Taking Action
Many redistricting officials may not be aware ofNative communities, their natural boundaries,and their political issues, so it is important forNative community members to participate, raiseawareness, and explain why they should be con-sidered. Each state has different rules about whois responsible for drawing new lines. In manystates, the state legislature draws lines for congressional districts and for state legislativedistricts. And at the county and local level, mapsare usually drawn by county and local officials. Although these officials get to make the final
decisions, they don’t make them alone. Manystates have requirements for public hearings and public comment, giving tribal leaders andcommunity advocates a chance to voice theiropinions on proposed maps or even submit a proposed map of their own. 
As we approach the redistricting season, NARF
has developed resources for Native communitiesto use during the upcoming redistricting process.Those materials are available at https://vote.narf.org/redistricting/ and include generaltoolkits, guides on how to organize and give testimony, and links to online tools for mapping.
Redistricting is a powerful tool that can be used
to suppress or advance Native political power. We have the ability to make a meaningful impacton how our communities are shaped for the next10 years. Right now, we have the ability to#ShapeNativeFutures.

The Native American Rights Fund has
helped to preserve the right of the RedLake Band of Chippewa Indians to runtheir tribal fisheries without interferencefrom the federal government.
On Friday, December 4, 2020, the US
Circuit Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit released its opinion in Scalia v.
Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc., No. 19-
3373, rejecting the US Department ofLabor’s attempt to regulate the tribalfisheries through the OccupationalSafety and Health Act (“OSHA”).
The case arose from a 2017 accident on
the lake that prompted the FederalOccupational Safety and HealthAdministration to send inspectors to theRed Lake Reservation, and ultimately toissue two citations with fines totalingmore than $15,000 to the Red LakeNation Fisheries, Inc. The Fisheries areincorporated under tribal law, whollyowned and operated by the Tribe, andemploy only tribal members. TheFisheries challenged the citations, argu-ing that the Department of Labor had noauthority to issue them to a tribal enter-prise operating within the tribe’s reserva-tion. The dispute first went to an admin-istrative law judge within theDepartment of Labor; that judge ruled infavor of the Tribe, relying in large part on an earlier Eighth Circuit decisionholding that the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act did not apply to a tribalenterprise and its tribal member employee.
The Department of Labor appealed,
pointing to OSHA’s broad definitions of“employer” and “commerce,” and arguingthat Congress intended the law to have aRed Lake Nation Fisheries Win Helps 
Preserve Tribal Sovereignty
very broad sweep. In addition, the Department argued,
because OSHA specifically excluded both federal and state
governments from the definition of “employer”—but didnot exclude tribal governments—Congress intended forOSHA to apply to tribal governments. Finally, theDepartment argued that the Fisheries should not be con-sidered a governmental entity, but rather a commercialentity.
But the Fisheries had the better argument. They, too,
pointed to the text of OSHA, noting that Congress said itenacted the law in order to regulate foreign and interstatecommerce, but said nothing about regulating Indian commerce. They pointed to more than a thousand pages ofCongressional testimony, research, and drafts that saidnothing about regulating tribes or tribal enterprises. They pointed to the Tribe’s treaty right to fish, and arguedfederal regulation would interfere both with that treatyfishing right and more broadly with the Tribe’s right togovern itself.VOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 5NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
Throughout, NARF was right there at the
Fisheries’ side. NARF helped attorneys for theFisheries test and refine their own arguments. In addition, NARF drafted an amicus brief onbehalf of the NCAI Fund (the educational arm ofthe National Congress of American Indians). Thatbrief pushed back against the Department ofLabor’s false governmental-vs-commercialdichotomy and more fully explored how acts ofCongress must be interpreted against a backdropof tribal sovereignty. The Fisheries also got anassist from the Shakopee Mdewakanton SiouxCommunity, which explained from that Tribe’sown experience how the Department of Laborcould achieve its goals through government-to-government cooperation, instead of coerciveinvestigation and enforcement.
The Eighth Circuit left no question which argu-
ment it found more persuasive. The three-judgepanel handed down a unanimous opinion holdingthat OSHA does not authorize the Federal government to regulate the Fisheries. “For astatute of general applicability to apply to Indian
self-government, this court looks for either anexplicit statement of Congress or evidence of con-gressional intent to abrogate in the legislativehistory of a statute,” the Court wrote (internalquotations, citation, and alteration omitted). Andthe Court found no such explicit statement inOSHA, and no such evidence of intent in OSHA’slegislative history.
Scalia v. Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc. is an
important case in an ongoing dispute in Indiancountry: do federal statutes of general applicabil-ity apply to Indian tribes and tribal enterprises?Several courts have held that they do, and havewrongly allowed the regulation of tribes and tribalenterprises through OSHA, the National LaborRelations Act, and other statutes that make nomention of tribes or tribal enterprises. With thewin in this case, Red Lake and NARF have helpedto hold the line against this creeping federalauthority, and to preserve tribal sovereignty forfuture generations.
Since 1991, the Native American Rights Fund
and the Western States Water Council (WSWC)have sponsored a biennial symposium to discussthe settlement of Indian reserved water rightsclaims. Due to COVID19 travel restrictions andconcerns, the symposium will be hosted virtuallythis year on August 24-25, 2021.

The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of the
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and isstaffed by the National Congress of AmericanIndians (NCAI) and NARF . The Project was formedin 2001 in response to a series of US SupremeCourt cases that negatively affected tribal sover-eignty. The Project’s purpose is to promotegreater coordination and to improve strategy onlitigation that may affect the rights of all Indiantribes. We encourage Indian tribes and their attor-neys to contact us to coordinate resources, devel-op strategy, and prepare briefs, especially at thetime of the petition for a writ of certiorari.

Duringthe officer’s interaction with the driver, he notedindicia of impairment, saw firearms in the vehicle,and believed that some of the driver’s responsesto his questions were untruthful. At a certainpoint, the driver’s demeanor changed and the
officer believed that the driver was going to useforce. The officer drew his pistol and placed thedriver in his police vehicle. A subsequent searchof the driver’s vehicle uncovered methampheta-mine and additional firearms. The trial courtgranted the driver’s motion to suppress evidenceobtained by the tribal police officer.

National Indian Law Library (NILL)
One significant initiative of the National Indian
Law Library (NILL) is its Access to Tribal LawProject.  The project’s mission is to provide triballeaders, legal practitioners, and the public withconvenient access to current and accurate copies oftribal law, including tribal codes and constitutions,intergovernmental agreements, and tribal courtopinions. Public access to these materials enhancesthe power of tribal courts and strengthens tribalsovereignty. To that end, NILL recently implement-ed an innovative digital tool that will make it easierfor tribes to share their codes and updates.
Digital Publishing Project
Last summer, NILL—along with its project part-ners Open Law Library, the University ofWisconsin Law Library and the Great LakesIndigenous Law Center—received grant fundingthrough the Institute of Museum and LibraryServices for a Digital Publication of Tribal LawsPilot Project (IMLS grant number LG-246285-OLS-20). Over the last year, the project has beendeveloping a digital platform to publish triballaws on library websites. The platform allowslibraries to offer an online collection of triballaws, while tribes maintain full control over thedigital copies of their laws. 
The project reached a milestone in April, when
NILL published on its website the official laws ofStockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.Much like the days when libraries held officialprint copies of codes on our shelves, we can nowhold an official digital copy of a tribe’s laws onour website while the tribe retains control overthe content. Access the Stockbridge MunseeCommunity’s laws at https://narf.org/nill/tribes/stockbridge.html. 
Tribes interested in publishing their laws
through the Open Law Platform can contact NILLat TribalLaw@narf.org for more information.
The Importance of Access 
The right to know the laws by which we are gov-erned is a fundamental right. Libraries are keenlyaware of the importance of access to legal infor-
mation, but few are able to pay commercial legaldatabases’ high fees. Our hope is that this afford-able digital publishing technology will allowother libraries—especially university libraries,public libraries, tribal college libraries, and tribalcommunity libraries—to make tribal laws moreaccessible.
The project’s ultimate goal is to increase public
access to the laws of Native nations. Tribal mem-bers and leaders will benefit from ready access totheir laws, which is essential for good governanceand ensuring due process and equal protection.Meanwhile, broader public access to tribal lawwill facilitate inter-governmental collaboration,encourage economic partnerships, and fostergreater understanding of tribal sovereignty andperspectives.
Tribal Law Projects at NILL
The Access to Tribal Law Project and the TribalLaw Gateway (https://narf.org/nill/triballaw/index.html) are high priorities for the NationalIndian Law Library.  Our goal is for the Gatewayto provide access to accurate tribal law informa-tion for all of the 574 federally recognized tribes,regardless of how they choose to make their lawsavailable.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious free-dom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishingrights, as well as basic human and civil rights. We contin-ue to take on complex, time-consuming cases that othersavoid, such as government accountability, climate change,and the education of our children. We have assisted morethan 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go to theheart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty . An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work involves protecting
tribal natural resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority of promoting
human rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen
laws that protect the rights of Native Americans to prac-tice their traditional religion, use their languages, andenjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peo-ples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspect oftribal life, NARF is committed to holding governmentsaccountable to Native Americans.
Developing Indian law and educating the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential for the con-
tinued protection of Indian rights. This primarily involvesestablishing favorable court precedents, distributinginformation and law materials, encouraging and fosteringIndian legal education, and forming alliances with Indianlaw practitioners and other Indian organizations.

Every ten years, the
United States holdsa Census to deter-mine how manypeople live in theUnited States andits territories. Onething that we dowith that popula-tion information isto divide the nation
into voting districts. That process is known asredistricting. Redistricting is the redrawing ofpolitical boundaries for election districts for theUS House of Representatives, state legislatures,county commissioners, city councils, schoolboards, and other local bodies. 
Having equal numbers of voters in each of a
state’s voting district protects the constitutionalright to have a vote that is equal to any other per-son’s vote. Thus, under the Constitution, a statemust ensure that its districts each have approxi-mately the same number of people. By redrawingthe lines every ten years, the government canmake changes to district boundaries based onwhere people have moved or where populationshave grown or shrunk. This often over-lookedprocess is essential for protecting our civil rightsand political strength. Without these periodicadjustments, the voting power of a particularcommunity can become diluted over time. 
In addition to preserving equal representation,
how officials define boundaries during the redis-tricting process is important. The way people aregrouped into districts has an immense influenceon who our representatives are and what policiesthey fight for. Voting districts control access to
political representation. Changing districtboundaries can change the political agency of thepeople therein. It is crucial that Native
Americans and Alaska Natives have an equalvoice in redistricting, to protect the ability ofNative voters to elect candidates of their choiceand protect their political power. The Native
American Rights Fund is providing educationand resources to make sure that Native commu-nities are prepared to effectively participate inthe 2021 redistricting process.
Redistricting Effects and Limitations
The United States Supreme Court started themodern era of redistricting in the 1960s. TheCourt’s rulings during this time were intended toaddress issues like the rural-urban tension andracial discrimination. Prior to the SupremeCourt rulings, some states across the countryhad not redistricted for decades. It was a way tomaintain existing power structures.

boundaries were not redrawn and districts were
increasingly unequal in size and equity. Forexample, one state legislator might represent45,000 people, while another only represented20,000. The people in the smaller district wouldhave disproportionately more representation,making the system unfair. 
The Supreme Court ended that practice by finding
that the US Constitution required equal popula-tions for state and federal legislative seats (exceptthe US Senate seats). They required states toredistrict every ten years, after the national censuswas completed.

small percentage of the popula-tion in each. This leaves themunable to elect their representa-tive of choice, despite havingenough votes to do so if theywere grouped together in a dis-trict. In the image on the previ-ous page, gray voters have beencracked in the third map, leav-ing them without control of anydistricts, even though they represent forty percent of thepopulation. In the alternative, amap might “pack” minority voters into one district, whenthey would have more politicalpower if they were spread out inmultiple districts. In the fourthmap, most of the blue votershave been packed into two districts. The rest of the bluevoters have been cracked up inthe other districts. This leaves the blue voterswith forty percent of the districts, even thoughthey are sixty percent of the population. 
When voters are unfairly “packed” or “cracked,”
even turning out every eligible voter may not beenough to win an election. This is why redistrictingis so important. 
In order to prevent racial gerrymandering, it is
necessary for Native Americans to advocate fortheir communities in the redistricting process.This is our chance to create a fair system that willstay in place for the next ten years. 
Taking Action
Many redistricting officials may not be aware ofNative communities, their natural boundaries,and their political issues, so it is important forNative community members to participate, raiseawareness, and explain why they should be con-sidered. Each state has different rules about whois responsible for drawing new lines. In manystates, the state legislature draws lines for congressional districts and for state legislativedistricts. And at the county and local level, mapsare usually drawn by county and local officials. Although these officials get to make the final
decisions, they don’t make them alone. Manystates have requirements for public hearings and public comment, giving tribal leaders andcommunity advocates a chance to voice theiropinions on proposed maps or even submit a proposed map of their own. 
As we approach the redistricting season, NARF
has developed resources for Native communitiesto use during the upcoming redistricting process.Those materials are available at https://vote.narf.org/redistricting/ and include generaltoolkits, guides on how to organize and give testimony, and links to online tools for mapping.
Redistricting is a powerful tool that can be used
to suppress or advance Native political power. We have the ability to make a meaningful impacton how our communities are shaped for the next10 years. Right now, we have the ability to#ShapeNativeFutures.

The Native American Rights Fund has
helped to preserve the right of the RedLake Band of Chippewa Indians to runtheir tribal fisheries without interferencefrom the federal government.
On Friday, December 4, 2020, the US
Circuit Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit released its opinion in Scalia v.
Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc., No. 19-
3373, rejecting the US Department ofLabor’s attempt to regulate the tribalfisheries through the OccupationalSafety and Health Act (“OSHA”).
The case arose from a 2017 accident on
the lake that prompted the FederalOccupational Safety and HealthAdministration to send inspectors to theRed Lake Reservation, and ultimately toissue two citations with fines totalingmore than $15,000 to the Red LakeNation Fisheries, Inc. The Fisheries areincorporated under tribal law, whollyowned and operated by the Tribe, andemploy only tribal members. TheFisheries challenged the citations, argu-ing that the Department of Labor had noauthority to issue them to a tribal enter-prise operating within the tribe’s reserva-tion. The dispute first went to an admin-istrative law judge within theDepartment of Labor; that judge ruled infavor of the Tribe, relying in large part on an earlier Eighth Circuit decisionholding that the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act did not apply to a tribalenterprise and its tribal member employee.
The Department of Labor appealed,
pointing to OSHA’s broad definitions of“employer” and “commerce,” and arguingthat Congress intended the law to have aRed Lake Nation Fisheries Win Helps 
Preserve Tribal Sovereignty
very broad sweep. In addition, the Department argued,
because OSHA specifically excluded both federal and state
governments from the definition of “employer”—but didnot exclude tribal governments—Congress intended forOSHA to apply to tribal governments. Finally, theDepartment argued that the Fisheries should not be con-sidered a governmental entity, but rather a commercialentity.
But the Fisheries had the better argument. They, too,
pointed to the text of OSHA, noting that Congress said itenacted the law in order to regulate foreign and interstatecommerce, but said nothing about regulating Indian commerce. They pointed to more than a thousand pages ofCongressional testimony, research, and drafts that saidnothing about regulating tribes or tribal enterprises. They pointed to the Tribe’s treaty right to fish, and arguedfederal regulation would interfere both with that treatyfishing right and more broadly with the Tribe’s right togovern itself.VOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 5NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
Throughout, NARF was right there at the
Fisheries’ side. NARF helped attorneys for theFisheries test and refine their own arguments. In addition, NARF drafted an amicus brief onbehalf of the NCAI Fund (the educational arm ofthe National Congress of American Indians). Thatbrief pushed back against the Department ofLabor’s false governmental-vs-commercialdichotomy and more fully explored how acts ofCongress must be interpreted against a backdropof tribal sovereignty. The Fisheries also got anassist from the Shakopee Mdewakanton SiouxCommunity, which explained from that Tribe’sown experience how the Department of Laborcould achieve its goals through government-to-government cooperation, instead of coerciveinvestigation and enforcement.
The Eighth Circuit left no question which argu-
ment it found more persuasive. The three-judgepanel handed down a unanimous opinion holdingthat OSHA does not authorize the Federal government to regulate the Fisheries. “For astatute of general applicability to apply to Indian
self-government, this court looks for either anexplicit statement of Congress or evidence of con-gressional intent to abrogate in the legislativehistory of a statute,” the Court wrote (internalquotations, citation, and alteration omitted). Andthe Court found no such explicit statement inOSHA, and no such evidence of intent in OSHA’slegislative history.
Scalia v. Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc. is an
important case in an ongoing dispute in Indiancountry: do federal statutes of general applicabil-ity apply to Indian tribes and tribal enterprises?Several courts have held that they do, and havewrongly allowed the regulation of tribes and tribalenterprises through OSHA, the National LaborRelations Act, and other statutes that make nomention of tribes or tribal enterprises. With thewin in this case, Red Lake and NARF have helpedto hold the line against this creeping federalauthority, and to preserve tribal sovereignty forfuture generations.
Since 1991, the Native American Rights Fund
and the Western States Water Council (WSWC)have sponsored a biennial symposium to discussthe settlement of Indian reserved water rightsclaims. Due to COVID19 travel restrictions andconcerns, the symposium will be hosted virtuallythis year on August 24-25, 2021.

The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of the
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and isstaffed by the National Congress of AmericanIndians (NCAI) and NARF . The Project was formedin 2001 in response to a series of US SupremeCourt cases that negatively affected tribal sover-eignty. The Project’s purpose is to promotegreater coordination and to improve strategy onlitigation that may affect the rights of all Indiantribes. We encourage Indian tribes and their attor-neys to contact us to coordinate resources, devel-op strategy, and prepare briefs, especially at thetime of the petition for a writ of certiorari. 
This spring, the Court heard argument in two
Indian law cases. On March 23, 2021, the Courtheard Cooley v. United States (19-1414), a caseinvolving an Indian tribe’s police authority todetain a non-Indian based on a reasonable suspi-cion that he has violated state or federal law.

Duringthe officer’s interaction with the driver, he notedindicia of impairment, saw firearms in the vehicle,and believed that some of the driver’s responsesto his questions were untruthful. At a certainpoint, the driver’s demeanor changed and the
officer believed that the driver was going to useforce. The officer drew his pistol and placed thedriver in his police vehicle. A subsequent searchof the driver’s vehicle uncovered methampheta-mine and additional firearms. The trial courtgranted the driver’s motion to suppress evidenceobtained by the tribal police officer. A NinthCircuit panel held that the evidence was inadmis-sible in a federal court prosecution.

National Indian Law Library (NILL)
One significant initiative of the National Indian
Law Library (NILL) is its Access to Tribal LawProject.  The project’s mission is to provide triballeaders, legal practitioners, and the public withconvenient access to current and accurate copies oftribal law, including tribal codes and constitutions,intergovernmental agreements, and tribal courtopinions. Public access to these materials enhancesthe power of tribal courts and strengthens tribalsovereignty. To that end, NILL recently implement-ed an innovative digital tool that will make it easierfor tribes to share their codes and updates.
Digital Publishing Project
Last summer, NILL—along with its project part-ners Open Law Library, the University ofWisconsin Law Library and the Great LakesIndigenous Law Center—received grant fundingthrough the Institute of Museum and LibraryServices for a Digital Publication of Tribal LawsPilot Project (IMLS grant number LG-246285-OLS-20). Over the last year, the project has beendeveloping a digital platform to publish triballaws on library websites. The platform allowslibraries to offer an online collection of triballaws, while tribes maintain full control over thedigital copies of their laws. 
The project reached a milestone in April, when
NILL published on its website the official laws ofStockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.Much like the days when libraries held officialprint copies of codes on our shelves, we can nowhold an official digital copy of a tribe’s laws onour website while the tribe retains control overthe content. Access the Stockbridge MunseeCommunity’s laws at https://narf.org/nill/tribes/stockbridge.html. 
Tribes interested in publishing their laws
through the Open Law Platform can contact NILLat TribalLaw@narf.org for more information.
The Importance of Access 
The right to know the laws by which we are gov-erned is a fundamental right. Libraries are keenlyaware of the importance of access to legal infor-
mation, but few are able to pay commercial legaldatabases’ high fees. Our hope is that this afford-able digital publishing technology will allowother libraries—especially university libraries,public libraries, tribal college libraries, and tribalcommunity libraries—to make tribal laws moreaccessible.
The project’s ultimate goal is to increase public
access to the laws of Native nations. Tribal mem-bers and leaders will benefit from ready access totheir laws, which is essential for good governanceand ensuring due process and equal protection.Meanwhile, broader public access to tribal lawwill facilitate inter-governmental collaboration,encourage economic partnerships, and fostergreater understanding of tribal sovereignty andperspectives.
Tribal Law Projects at NILL
The Access to Tribal Law Project and the TribalLaw Gateway (https://narf.org/nill/triballaw/index.html) are high priorities for the NationalIndian Law Library.  Our goal is for the Gatewayto provide access to accurate tribal law informa-tion for all of the 574 federally recognized tribes,regardless of how they choose to make their lawsavailable.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious free-dom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishingrights, as well as basic human and civil rights. We contin-ue to take on complex, time-consuming cases that othersavoid, such as government accountability, climate change,and the education of our children. We have assisted morethan 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go to theheart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty . An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work involves protecting
tribal natural resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority of promoting
human rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen
laws that protect the rights of Native Americans to prac-tice their traditional religion, use their languages, andenjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peo-ples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspect oftribal life, NARF is committed to holding governmentsaccountable to Native Americans.
Developing Indian law and educating the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential for the con-
tinued protection of Indian rights. This primarily involvesestablishing favorable court precedents, distributinginformation and law materials, encouraging and fosteringIndian legal education, and forming alliances with Indianlaw practitioners and other Indian organizations.

Every ten years, the
United States holdsa Census to deter-mine how manypeople live in theUnited States andits territories. Onething that we dowith that popula-tion information isto divide the nation
into voting districts. That process is known asredistricting. Redistricting is the redrawing ofpolitical boundaries for election districts for theUS House of Representatives, state legislatures,county commissioners, city councils, schoolboards, and other local bodies. 
Having equal numbers of voters in each of a
state’s voting district protects the constitutionalright to have a vote that is equal to any other per-son’s vote. Thus, under the Constitution, a statemust ensure that its districts each have approxi-mately the same number of people. By redrawingthe lines every ten years, the government canmake changes to district boundaries based onwhere people have moved or where populationshave grown or shrunk. This often over-lookedprocess is essential for protecting our civil rightsand political strength. Without these periodicadjustments, the voting power of a particularcommunity can become diluted over time. 
In addition to preserving equal representation,
how officials define boundaries during the redis-tricting process is important. The way people aregrouped into districts has an immense influenceon who our representatives are and what policiesthey fight for. Voting districts control access to
political representation. Changing districtboundaries can change the political agency of thepeople therein. It is crucial that Native
Americans and Alaska Natives have an equalvoice in redistricting, to protect the ability ofNative voters to elect candidates of their choiceand protect their political power. The Native
American Rights Fund is providing educationand resources to make sure that Native commu-nities are prepared to effectively participate inthe 2021 redistricting process.
Redistricting Effects and Limitations
The United States Supreme Court started themodern era of redistricting in the 1960s. TheCourt’s rulings during this time were intended toaddress issues like the rural-urban tension andracial discrimination. Prior to the SupremeCourt rulings, some states across the countryhad not redistricted for decades. It was a way tomaintain existing power structures. 
During the first half of the 20th century, many
states resisted redistricting, and voting districtsoften became markedly unequal as populationsshifted from one region to another. Political

boundaries were not redrawn and districts were
increasingly unequal in size and equity. Forexample, one state legislator might represent45,000 people, while another only represented20,000. The people in the smaller district wouldhave disproportionately more representation,making the system unfair. 
The Supreme Court ended that practice by finding
that the US Constitution required equal popula-tions for state and federal legislative seats (exceptthe US Senate seats). They required states toredistrict every ten years, after the national censuswas completed.
After the Court required redistricting and equal
districts, partisans shifted efforts. Instead ofresisting redistricting entirely, they envisionedways to work within the Court’s requirements,but still give their interest group the most seats
and political representation that they could. In order to do this, organizers ignored obviouscommunity boundaries and instead createdboundaries that moved blocks of voters betweendistricts in a way that created an advantage fortheir own interest group.
Gerrymandering
Those undemocratic efforts paid off. It soonbecame clear that, even when districts have nearlyequal populations, a map can still limit a certaingroup’s political power. This abuse of redistrictingis called gerrymandering. Often it is used toexclude communities from political power com-pletely. 
District lines often dilute votes in two ways. First,
district lines can “crack” minority voters into
PAGE 2                                                                           NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDVOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 3NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDmany districts, where they are a
small percentage of the popula-tion in each. This leaves themunable to elect their representa-tive of choice, despite havingenough votes to do so if theywere grouped together in a dis-trict. In the image on the previ-ous page, gray voters have beencracked in the third map, leav-ing them without control of anydistricts, even though they represent forty percent of thepopulation. In the alternative, amap might “pack” minority voters into one district, whenthey would have more politicalpower if they were spread out inmultiple districts. In the fourthmap, most of the blue votershave been packed into two districts. The rest of the bluevoters have been cracked up inthe other districts. This leaves the blue voterswith forty percent of the districts, even thoughthey are sixty percent of the population. 
When voters are unfairly “packed” or “cracked,”
even turning out every eligible voter may not beenough to win an election. This is why redistrictingis so important. 
In order to prevent racial gerrymandering, it is
necessary for Native Americans to advocate fortheir communities in the redistricting process.This is our chance to create a fair system that willstay in place for the next ten years. 
Taking Action
Many redistricting officials may not be aware ofNative communities, their natural boundaries,and their political issues, so it is important forNative community members to participate, raiseawareness, and explain why they should be con-sidered. Each state has different rules about whois responsible for drawing new lines. In manystates, the state legislature draws lines for congressional districts and for state legislativedistricts. And at the county and local level, mapsare usually drawn by county and local officials. Although these officials get to make the final
decisions, they don’t make them alone. Manystates have requirements for public hearings and public comment, giving tribal leaders andcommunity advocates a chance to voice theiropinions on proposed maps or even submit a proposed map of their own. 
As we approach the redistricting season, NARF
has developed resources for Native communitiesto use during the upcoming redistricting process.Those materials are available at https://vote.narf.org/redistricting/ and include generaltoolkits, guides on how to organize and give testimony, and links to online tools for mapping.
Redistricting is a powerful tool that can be used
to suppress or advance Native political power. We have the ability to make a meaningful impacton how our communities are shaped for the next10 years. Right now, we have the ability to#ShapeNativeFutures.

The Native American Rights Fund has
helped to preserve the right of the RedLake Band of Chippewa Indians to runtheir tribal fisheries without interferencefrom the federal government.
On Friday, December 4, 2020, the US
Circuit Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit released its opinion in Scalia v.
Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc., No. 19-
3373, rejecting the US Department ofLabor’s attempt to regulate the tribalfisheries through the OccupationalSafety and Health Act (“OSHA”).
The case arose from a 2017 accident on
the lake that prompted the FederalOccupational Safety and HealthAdministration to send inspectors to theRed Lake Reservation, and ultimately toissue two citations with fines totalingmore than $15,000 to the Red LakeNation Fisheries, Inc. The Fisheries areincorporated under tribal law, whollyowned and operated by the Tribe, andemploy only tribal members. TheFisheries challenged the citations, argu-ing that the Department of Labor had noauthority to issue them to a tribal enter-prise operating within the tribe’s reserva-tion. The dispute first went to an admin-istrative law judge within theDepartment of Labor; that judge ruled infavor of the Tribe, relying in large part on an earlier Eighth Circuit decisionholding that the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act did not apply to a tribalenterprise and its tribal member employee.
The Department of Labor appealed,
pointing to OSHA’s broad definitions of“employer” and “commerce,” and arguingthat Congress intended the law to have aRed Lake Nation Fisheries Win Helps 
Preserve Tribal Sovereignty
very broad sweep. In addition, the Department argued,
because OSHA specifically excluded both federal and state
governments from the definition of “employer”—but didnot exclude tribal governments—Congress intended forOSHA to apply to tribal governments. Finally, theDepartment argued that the Fisheries should not be con-sidered a governmental entity, but rather a commercialentity.
But the Fisheries had the better argument. They, too,
pointed to the text of OSHA, noting that Congress said itenacted the law in order to regulate foreign and interstatecommerce, but said nothing about regulating Indian commerce. They pointed to more than a thousand pages ofCongressional testimony, research, and drafts that saidnothing about regulating tribes or tribal enterprises. They pointed to the Tribe’s treaty right to fish, and arguedfederal regulation would interfere both with that treatyfishing right and more broadly with the Tribe’s right togovern itself.VOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 5NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
Throughout, NARF was right there at the
Fisheries’ side. NARF helped attorneys for theFisheries test and refine their own arguments. In addition, NARF drafted an amicus brief onbehalf of the NCAI Fund (the educational arm ofthe National Congress of American Indians). Thatbrief pushed back against the Department ofLabor’s false governmental-vs-commercialdichotomy and more fully explored how acts ofCongress must be interpreted against a backdropof tribal sovereignty. The Fisheries also got anassist from the Shakopee Mdewakanton SiouxCommunity, which explained from that Tribe’sown experience how the Department of Laborcould achieve its goals through government-to-government cooperation, instead of coerciveinvestigation and enforcement.
The Eighth Circuit left no question which argu-
ment it found more persuasive. The three-judgepanel handed down a unanimous opinion holdingthat OSHA does not authorize the Federal government to regulate the Fisheries. “For astatute of general applicability to apply to Indian
self-government, this court looks for either anexplicit statement of Congress or evidence of con-gressional intent to abrogate in the legislativehistory of a statute,” the Court wrote (internalquotations, citation, and alteration omitted). Andthe Court found no such explicit statement inOSHA, and no such evidence of intent in OSHA’slegislative history.
Scalia v. Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc. is an
important case in an ongoing dispute in Indiancountry: do federal statutes of general applicabil-ity apply to Indian tribes and tribal enterprises?Several courts have held that they do, and havewrongly allowed the regulation of tribes and tribalenterprises through OSHA, the National LaborRelations Act, and other statutes that make nomention of tribes or tribal enterprises. With thewin in this case, Red Lake and NARF have helpedto hold the line against this creeping federalauthority, and to preserve tribal sovereignty forfuture generations.
Since 1991, the Native American Rights Fund
and the Western States Water Council (WSWC)have sponsored a biennial symposium to discussthe settlement of Indian reserved water rightsclaims. Due to COVID19 travel restrictions andconcerns, the symposium will be hosted virtuallythis year on August 24-25, 2021.

The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of the
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and isstaffed by the National Congress of AmericanIndians (NCAI) and NARF . The Project was formedin 2001 in response to a series of US SupremeCourt cases that negatively affected tribal sover-eignty. The Project’s purpose is to promotegreater coordination and to improve strategy onlitigation that may affect the rights of all Indiantribes. We encourage Indian tribes and their attor-neys to contact us to coordinate resources, devel-op strategy, and prepare briefs, especially at thetime of the petition for a writ of certiorari.

National Indian Law Library (NILL)
One significant initiative of the National Indian
Law Library (NILL) is its Access to Tribal LawProject.  The project’s mission is to provide triballeaders, legal practitioners, and the public withconvenient access to current and accurate copies oftribal law, including tribal codes and constitutions,intergovernmental agreements, and tribal courtopinions. Public access to these materials enhancesthe power of tribal courts and strengthens tribalsovereignty. To that end, NILL recently implement-ed an innovative digital tool that will make it easierfor tribes to share their codes and updates.
Digital Publishing Project
Last summer, NILL—along with its project part-ners Open Law Library, the University ofWisconsin Law Library and the Great LakesIndigenous Law Center—received grant fundingthrough the Institute of Museum and LibraryServices for a Digital Publication of Tribal LawsPilot Project (IMLS grant number LG-246285-OLS-20). Over the last year, the project has beendeveloping a digital platform to publish triballaws on library websites. The platform allowslibraries to offer an online collection of triballaws, while tribes maintain full control over thedigital copies of their laws. 
The project reached a milestone in April, when
NILL published on its website the official laws ofStockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.Much like the days when libraries held officialprint copies of codes on our shelves, we can nowhold an official digital copy of a tribe’s laws onour website while the tribe retains control overthe content. Access the Stockbridge MunseeCommunity’s laws at https://narf.org/nill/tribes/stockbridge.html. 
Tribes interested in publishing their laws
through the Open Law Platform can contact NILLat TribalLaw@narf.org for more information.
The Importance of Access 
The right to know the laws by which we are gov-erned is a fundamental right. Libraries are keenlyaware of the importance of access to legal infor-
mation, but few are able to pay commercial legaldatabases’ high fees. Our hope is that this afford-able digital publishing technology will allowother libraries—especially university libraries,public libraries, tribal college libraries, and tribalcommunity libraries—to make tribal laws moreaccessible.
The project’s ultimate goal is to increase public
access to the laws of Native nations. Tribal mem-bers and leaders will benefit from ready access totheir laws, which is essential for good governanceand ensuring due process and equal protection.Meanwhile, broader public access to tribal lawwill facilitate inter-governmental collaboration,encourage economic partnerships, and fostergreater understanding of tribal sovereignty andperspectives.
Tribal Law Projects at NILL
The Access to Tribal Law Project and the TribalLaw Gateway (https://narf.org/nill/triballaw/index.html) are high priorities for the NationalIndian Law Library.  Our goal is for the Gatewayto provide access to accurate tribal law informa-tion for all of the 574 federally recognized tribes,regardless of how they choose to make their lawsavailable.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious free-dom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishingrights, as well as basic human and civil rights. We contin-ue to take on complex, time-consuming cases that othersavoid, such as government accountability, climate change,and the education of our children. We have assisted morethan 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go to theheart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty . An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work involves protecting
tribal natural resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority of promoting
human rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen
laws that protect the rights of Native Americans to prac-tice their traditional religion, use their languages, andenjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peo-ples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspect oftribal life, NARF is committed to holding governmentsaccountable to Native Americans.
Developing Indian law and educating the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential for the con-
tinued protection of Indian rights. This primarily involvesestablishing favorable court precedents, distributinginformation and law materials, encouraging and fosteringIndian legal education, and forming alliances with Indianlaw practitioners and other Indian organizations.

Every ten years, the
United States holdsa Census to deter-mine how manypeople live in theUnited States andits territories. Onething that we dowith that popula-tion information isto divide the nation
into voting districts. That process is known asredistricting. Redistricting is the redrawing ofpolitical boundaries for election districts for theUS House of Representatives, state legislatures,county commissioners, city councils, schoolboards, and other local bodies. 
Having equal numbers of voters in each of a
state’s voting district protects the constitutionalright to have a vote that is equal to any other per-son’s vote. Thus, under the Constitution, a statemust ensure that its districts each have approxi-mately the same number of people. By redrawingthe lines every ten years, the government canmake changes to district boundaries based onwhere people have moved or where populationshave grown or shrunk. This often over-lookedprocess is essential for protecting our civil rightsand political strength. Without these periodicadjustments, the voting power of a particularcommunity can become diluted over time. 
In addition to preserving equal representation,
how officials define boundaries during the redis-tricting process is important. The way people aregrouped into districts has an immense influenceon who our representatives are and what policiesthey fight for. Voting districts control access to
political representation. Changing districtboundaries can change the political agency of thepeople therein. It is crucial that Native
Americans and Alaska Natives have an equalvoice in redistricting, to protect the ability ofNative voters to elect candidates of their choiceand protect their political power. The Native
American Rights Fund is providing educationand resources to make sure that Native commu-nities are prepared to effectively participate inthe 2021 redistricting process.
Redistricting Effects and Limitations
The United States Supreme Court started themodern era of redistricting in the 1960s. TheCourt’s rulings during this time were intended toaddress issues like the rural-urban tension andracial discrimination. Prior to the SupremeCourt rulings, some states across the countryhad not redistricted for decades. It was a way tomaintain existing power structures. 
During the first half of the 20th century, many
states resisted redistricting, and voting districtsoften became markedly unequal as populationsshifted from one region to another. Political

boundaries were not redrawn and districts were
increasingly unequal in size and equity. Forexample, one state legislator might represent45,000 people, while another only represented20,000. The people in the smaller district wouldhave disproportionately more representation,making the system unfair. 
The Supreme Court ended that practice by finding
that the US Constitution required equal popula-tions for state and federal legislative seats (exceptthe US Senate seats). They required states toredistrict every ten years, after the national censuswas completed.
After the Court required redistricting and equal
districts, partisans shifted efforts. Instead ofresisting redistricting entirely, they envisionedways to work within the Court’s requirements,but still give their interest group the most seats
and political representation that they could. In order to do this, organizers ignored obviouscommunity boundaries and instead createdboundaries that moved blocks of voters betweendistricts in a way that created an advantage fortheir own interest group.
Gerrymandering
Those undemocratic efforts paid off. It soonbecame clear that, even when districts have nearlyequal populations, a map can still limit a certaingroup’s political power. This abuse of redistrictingis called gerrymandering. Often it is used toexclude communities from political power com-pletely. 
District lines often dilute votes in two ways. First,
district lines can “crack” minority voters into
PAGE 2                                                                           NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDVOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 3NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDmany districts, where they are a
small percentage of the popula-tion in each. This leaves themunable to elect their representa-tive of choice, despite havingenough votes to do so if theywere grouped together in a dis-trict. In the image on the previ-ous page, gray voters have beencracked in the third map, leav-ing them without control of anydistricts, even though they represent forty percent of thepopulation. In the alternative, amap might “pack” minority voters into one district, whenthey would have more politicalpower if they were spread out inmultiple districts. In the fourthmap, most of the blue votershave been packed into two districts. The rest of the bluevoters have been cracked up inthe other districts. This leaves the blue voterswith forty percent of the districts, even thoughthey are sixty percent of the population. 
When voters are unfairly “packed” or “cracked,”
even turning out every eligible voter may not beenough to win an election. This is why redistrictingis so important. 
In order to prevent racial gerrymandering, it is
necessary for Native Americans to advocate fortheir communities in the redistricting process.This is our chance to create a fair system that willstay in place for the next ten years. 
Taking Action
Many redistricting officials may not be aware ofNative communities, their natural boundaries,and their political issues, so it is important forNative community members to participate, raiseawareness, and explain why they should be con-sidered. Each state has different rules about whois responsible for drawing new lines. In manystates, the state legislature draws lines for congressional districts and for state legislativedistricts. And at the county and local level, mapsare usually drawn by county and local officials. Although these officials get to make the final
decisions, they don’t make them alone. Manystates have requirements for public hearings and public comment, giving tribal leaders andcommunity advocates a chance to voice theiropinions on proposed maps or even submit a proposed map of their own. 
As we approach the redistricting season, NARF
has developed resources for Native communitiesto use during the upcoming redistricting process.Those materials are available at https://vote.narf.org/redistricting/ and include generaltoolkits, guides on how to organize and give testimony, and links to online tools for mapping.
Redistricting is a powerful tool that can be used
to suppress or advance Native political power. We have the ability to make a meaningful impacton how our communities are shaped for the next10 years. Right now, we have the ability to#ShapeNativeFutures.

The Native American Rights Fund has
helped to preserve the right of the RedLake Band of Chippewa Indians to runtheir tribal fisheries without interferencefrom the federal government.
On Friday, December 4, 2020, the US
Circuit Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit released its opinion in Scalia v.
Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc., No. 19-
3373, rejecting the US Department ofLabor’s attempt to regulate the tribalfisheries through the OccupationalSafety and Health Act (“OSHA”).
The case arose from a 2017 accident on
the lake that prompted the FederalOccupational Safety and HealthAdministration to send inspectors to theRed Lake Reservation, and ultimately toissue two citations with fines totalingmore than $15,000 to the Red LakeNation Fisheries, Inc. The Fisheries areincorporated under tribal law, whollyowned and operated by the Tribe, andemploy only tribal members. TheFisheries challenged the citations, argu-ing that the Department of Labor had noauthority to issue them to a tribal enter-prise operating within the tribe’s reserva-tion. The dispute first went to an admin-istrative law judge within theDepartment of Labor; that judge ruled infavor of the Tribe, relying in large part on an earlier Eighth Circuit decisionholding that the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act did not apply to a tribalenterprise and its tribal member employee.
The Department of Labor appealed,
pointing to OSHA’s broad definitions of“employer” and “commerce,” and arguingthat Congress intended the law to have aRed Lake Nation Fisheries Win Helps 
Preserve Tribal Sovereignty
very broad sweep. In addition, the Department argued,
because OSHA specifically excluded both federal and state
governments from the definition of “employer”—but didnot exclude tribal governments—Congress intended forOSHA to apply to tribal governments. Finally, theDepartment argued that the Fisheries should not be con-sidered a governmental entity, but rather a commercialentity.
But the Fisheries had the better argument. They, too,
pointed to the text of OSHA, noting that Congress said itenacted the law in order to regulate foreign and interstatecommerce, but said nothing about regulating Indian commerce. They pointed to more than a thousand pages ofCongressional testimony, research, and drafts that saidnothing about regulating tribes or tribal enterprises. They pointed to the Tribe’s treaty right to fish, and arguedfederal regulation would interfere both with that treatyfishing right and more broadly with the Tribe’s right togovern itself.VOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 5NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
Throughout, NARF was right there at the
Fisheries’ side. NARF helped attorneys for theFisheries test and refine their own arguments. In addition, NARF drafted an amicus brief onbehalf of the NCAI Fund (the educational arm ofthe National Congress of American Indians). Thatbrief pushed back against the Department ofLabor’s false governmental-vs-commercialdichotomy and more fully explored how acts ofCongress must be interpreted against a backdropof tribal sovereignty. The Fisheries also got anassist from the Shakopee Mdewakanton SiouxCommunity, which explained from that Tribe’sown experience how the Department of Laborcould achieve its goals through government-to-government cooperation, instead of coerciveinvestigation and enforcement.
The Eighth Circuit left no question which argu-
ment it found more persuasive. The three-judgepanel handed down a unanimous opinion holdingthat OSHA does not authorize the Federal government to regulate the Fisheries. “For astatute of general applicability to apply to Indian
self-government, this court looks for either anexplicit statement of Congress or evidence of con-gressional intent to abrogate in the legislativehistory of a statute,” the Court wrote (internalquotations, citation, and alteration omitted). Andthe Court found no such explicit statement inOSHA, and no such evidence of intent in OSHA’slegislative history.
Scalia v. Red Lake Nation Fisheries, Inc. is an
important case in an ongoing dispute in Indiancountry: do federal statutes of general applicabil-ity apply to Indian tribes and tribal enterprises?Several courts have held that they do, and havewrongly allowed the regulation of tribes and tribalenterprises through OSHA, the National LaborRelations Act, and other statutes that make nomention of tribes or tribal enterprises. With thewin in this case, Red Lake and NARF have helpedto hold the line against this creeping federalauthority, and to preserve tribal sovereignty forfuture generations.
Since 1991, the Native American Rights Fund
and the Western States Water Council (WSWC)have sponsored a biennial symposium to discussthe settlement of Indian reserved water rightsclaims. Due to COVID19 travel restrictions andconcerns, the symposium will be hosted virtuallythis year on August 24-25, 2021.

on the Rights of IndigenousPeoples represents the humanrights aspirations of indigenouspeoples from across the globe.It can be an important tool fortribal advocates seeking legalreform in the United States as itsets standards for the just treat-ment, legal rights, and relation-ships of indigenous peoples.  
Recognizing the potential of
the Declaration to promoteNative American legal rightsthe Native American RightsFund and the University ofColorado Law School createdthe Project to Implement theUnited Nations Declaration onthe Rights of IndigenousPeoples in the United States.The Project raises IndianCountry’s awareness of theDeclaration and supportsimplementation efforts. OnApril 12, 2021, the Projectreleased the TribalImplementation Toolkit. TheToolkit (which was produced incollaboration between theNative American Rights Fund,the University of Colorado LawSchool, and UCLA Law’s TribalLegal Development Clinic)examines how tribes can sup-port and implement theDeclaration through tribal law-making.

VOLUME 45, NO. 2 PAGE 7NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of the
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and isstaffed by the National Congress of AmericanIndians (NCAI) and NARF . The Project was formedin 2001 in response to a series of US SupremeCourt cases that negatively affected tribal sover-eignty. The Project’s purpose is to promotegreater coordination and to improve strategy onlitigation that may affect the rights of all Indiantribes. We encourage Indian tribes and their attor-neys to contact us to coordinate resources, devel-op strategy, and prepare briefs, especially at thetime of the petition for a writ of certiorari. 
This spring, the Court heard argument in two
Indian law cases. On March 23, 2021, the Courtheard Cooley v. United States (19-1414), a caseinvolving an Indian tribe’s police authority todetain a non-Indian based on a reasonable suspi-cion that he has violated state or federal law.

Several federally-recognized Indian tribes sued
the United States after the Department of theTreasury announced that Alaska NativeCorporations (ANCs) would be eligible to receivefunds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, andEconomic Security (CARES) Act. Several ANCsintervened as defendants. The district court ruledin favor of the United States and ANCs. In revers-ing, the D.C.

cotics and firearms offenses as result of evidencediscovered by a Crow Tribe police officer during asafety check of the vehicle parked on the side of astate roadway crossing the reservation. Duringthe officer’s interaction with the driver, he notedindicia of impairment, saw firearms in the vehicle,and believed that some of the driver’s responsesto his questions were untruthful. At a certainpoint, the driver’s demeanor changed and the
officer believed that the driver was going to useforce. The officer drew his pistol and placed thedriver in his police vehicle. A subsequent searchof the driver’s vehicle uncovered methampheta-mine and additional firearms. The trial courtgranted the driver’s motion to suppress evidenceobtained by the tribal police officer.

National Indian Law Library (NILL)
One significant initiative of the National Indian
Law Library (NILL) is its Access to Tribal LawProject.  The project’s mission is to provide triballeaders, legal practitioners, and the public withconvenient access to current and accurate copies oftribal law, including tribal codes and constitutions,intergovernmental agreements, and tribal courtopinions. Public access to these materials enhancesthe power of tribal courts and strengthens tribalsovereignty. To that end, NILL recently implement-ed an innovative digital tool that will make it easierfor tribes to share their codes and updates.
Digital Publishing Project
Last summer, NILL—along with its project part-ners Open Law Library, the University ofWisconsin Law Library and the Great LakesIndigenous Law Center—received grant fundingthrough the Institute of Museum and LibraryServices for a Digital Publication of Tribal LawsPilot Project (IMLS grant number LG-246285-OLS-20). Over the last year, the project has beendeveloping a digital platform to publish triballaws on library websites. The platform allowslibraries to offer an online collection of triballaws, while tribes maintain full control over thedigital copies of their laws. 
The project reached a milestone in April, when
NILL published on its website the official laws ofStockbridge Munsee Community, Wisconsin.Much like the days when libraries held officialprint copies of codes on our shelves, we can nowhold an official digital copy of a tribe’s laws onour website while the tribe retains control overthe content. Access the Stockbridge MunseeCommunity’s laws at https://narf.org/nill/tribes/stockbridge.html. 
Tribes interested in publishing their laws
through the Open Law Platform can contact NILLat TribalLaw@narf.org for more information.
The Importance of Access 
The right to know the laws by which we are gov-erned is a fundamental right. Libraries are keenlyaware of the importance of access to legal infor-
mation, but few are able to pay commercial legaldatabases’ high fees. Our hope is that this afford-able digital publishing technology will allowother libraries—especially university libraries,public libraries, tribal college libraries, and tribalcommunity libraries—to make tribal laws moreaccessible.
The project’s ultimate goal is to increase public
access to the laws of Native nations. Tribal mem-bers and leaders will benefit from ready access totheir laws, which is essential for good governanceand ensuring due process and equal protection.Meanwhile, broader public access to tribal lawwill facilitate inter-governmental collaboration,encourage economic partnerships, and fostergreater understanding of tribal sovereignty andperspectives.
Tribal Law Projects at NILL
The Access to Tribal Law Project and the TribalLaw Gateway (https://narf.org/nill/triballaw/index.html) are high priorities for the NationalIndian Law Library.  Our goal is for the Gatewayto provide access to accurate tribal law informa-tion for all of the 574 federally recognized tribes,regardless of how they choose to make their lawsavailable.

Indian philanthropy can no longer sustainNARF’s work. Federal funds for specific projectshave also been reduced. To provide legal advocacyin a wide variety of areas such as religious free-dom, the Tribal Supreme Court Project, tribalrecognition, human rights, trust responsibility,voting rights, tribal water rights, Indian ChildWelfare Act, and tribal sovereignty issues, NARFlooks to the tribes to provide the crucial fundingto continue our legal advocacy on behalf ofIndian Country.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious free-dom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishingrights, as well as basic human and civil rights. We contin-ue to take on complex, time-consuming cases that othersavoid, such as government accountability, climate change,and the education of our children. We have assisted morethan 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go to theheart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty . An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work involves protecting
tribal natural resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority of promoting
human rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen
laws that protect the rights of Native Americans to prac-tice their traditional religion, use their languages, andenjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peo-ples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspect oftribal life, NARF is committed to holding governmentsaccountable to Native Americans.
Developing Indian law and educating the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential for the con-
tinued protection of Indian rights. This primarily involvesestablishing favorable court precedents, distributinginformation and law materials, encouraging and fosteringIndian legal education, and forming alliances with Indianlaw practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to
NARF's main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302.NARF’s clients are expected to pay what they can towardthe costs of legal representation.NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
