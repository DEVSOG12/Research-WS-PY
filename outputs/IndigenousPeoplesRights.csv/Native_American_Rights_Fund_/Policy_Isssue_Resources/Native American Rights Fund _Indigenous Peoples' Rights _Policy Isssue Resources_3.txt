Brackeen  Headed to the U.S. Supreme Court
The U.S. Supreme Court in its next term will 
hear potentially the most important Indian law 
case in a generation when it decides whether 
Congress exceeded its constitutional powers when 
it enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of  1978 
(ICWA). 
ICWA sets minimum federal standards for child 
custody proceedings involving any child who 
is a member of  a federally recognized tribe (or 
who is both eligible for tribal membership and 
the biological child of  a tribal member).  Child 
welfare advocates have long considered ICWA the 
gold standard in child welfare practice. However, 
in the case that is now known as Brackeen v. 
Haaland , plaintiffs who oppose ICWA alleged 
that ICWA is unconstitutional for a variety of  
reasons. The U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit issued a split decision, and parties on both 
sides filed a total of  four petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court: one from the United 
States, one from four intervening tribes (Cherokee 
Nation, Morongo Band of  Mission Indians, 
Oneida Nation, and Quinault Indian Nation), 
one from the State of  Texas, and one from 
individuals who sought to adopt Indian children.  
In February 2022, the Supreme Court granted all 
four petitions and consolidated them under the 
caption Haaland v. Brackeen . 
The case before the Supreme Court presents 
multiple constitutional questions. Its outcome 
could have far-reaching effects for Native families 
and tribes. “In a coordinated, well-financed, 
direct attack, Texas and other opponents aim 
to simultaneously exploit Native children while undermining the law that protects them—
all while potentially undermining the entire 
framework of  federal-tribal relations. If  they 
succeed in weakening protections for Native 
children it could negatively impact Native families 
and tribes for generations,” said Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) Senior Staff  Attorney Erin 
Dougherty Lynch.

PAGE 2NARF LEGAL REVIEWRENEWED INTEREST IN ICWA
Although ICWA became law in 1978, throughout 
its history, states routinely applied its provisions 
inconsistently. To ensure uniformity and that best 
practices were used, child welfare advocates and 
tribes called on the federal government to update 
ICWA’s guidelines. In 2015, the Department of  
the Interior (Interior) did just that. The following 
year, after reviewing thousands of  comments from 
tribes, states, and child welfare agencies, Interior 
also promulgated legally binding ICWA regulations 
(the Final Rule). In the wake of  these agency 
actions, the coordinated attack on ICWA began.
With the goal of  erasing ICWA and dismantling 
tribal sovereignty, many anti-tribal-sovereignty 
interests came together to establish an unlikely 
alliance. Adoption attorneys opposed the revised 
guidelines and efforts to increase regulation and 
oversight of  their highly profitable industry.  
The Goldwater Institute and a handful of  states 
opposed the Final Rule because it affirmed tribes’ 
authority and responsibility as sovereign nations 
to safeguard their citizens. And a fringe subset 
of  foster-family advocates opposed the Final 
Rule as part of  a broader effort to expand foster 
parents’ rights. Throughout the subsequent years 
of  litigation in various federal courts, this coalition 
built of  anti-tribal sovereignty interests coordinated 
their efforts to strike down child welfare protections 
for tribal citizens and attack tribal sovereignty at its 
core. TAKING IT TO THE COURTS
Although federal courts rarely hear ICWA-related 
cases, which typically fall under state or tribal 
jurisdiction, after the release of  the 2016 Final Rule, 
anti-ICWA forces filed lawsuits in various federal 
courts across the country. In 2017, anti-ICWA 
forces found a friendly venue in one division of  
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of  Texas, where that division’s sole civil judge 
has a history of  consistently overturning federal 
statutes. In October 2018, that judge issued a ruling 
invalidating many of  ICWA’s provisions. With this 
unprecedented ruling, the case headed to the U.S. 
Circuit Court of  Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
THE ROAD TO THE SUPREME COURT 
The Fifth Circuit includes the states of  Texas, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana.These states’ geographic 
boundaries contain few federally recognized 
tribes, and these states have limited experience 
in tribal-state coordination. In the Fifth Circuit’s 
August 2019 three-judge panel ruling, the tribes 
and federal government prevailed on most of  
the issues asserted in the case, including equal 
protection, commandeering, non-delegation, and 
the Administrative Procedures Act. However, when 
an en banc review (review by the entire court instead 
of  just a three-judge panel) was requested, the 
court granted this request and held additional oral 
arguments in January 2020. 
By that time, the coalition supporting ICWA had 
grown impressively large. The Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) and its colleagues at the law 
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
PAGE 3VOLUME 47 NO. 1firm Dentons represented 486 tribes and 59 tribal 
organizations on a brief  in support of  ICWA, 
explaining its essential history and the Indian 
child welfare crisis that led Congress to enact the 
law.  Briefs in support of  ICWA came in from, 
among others, a bipartisan coalition of  26 states 
and the District of  Columbia, who described how 
ICWA is a critical tool that fosters state-tribal 
collaboration without improperly commandeering 
state agencies or courts; almost 30 leading child 
welfare organizations (including the Children’s 
Defense Fund, Adopt America Network, Child 
Welfare League of  America, Casey Family 
Programs, and FosterClub), who explained how 
ICWA exemplifies social work best practices that 
result in better outcomes for children; a bipartisan 
group of  members of  Congress, who explained 
why ICWA was a proper exercise of  Congress’s 
constitutional powers; and professors and scholars 
from across a variety of  fields. 
“Social workers, child psychologists, children’s 
advocates, adoption and foster care advocates, and 
tribes all support ICWA because the Act provides 
the gold-standard level of  protection for Native 
children.  ICWA also allows tribal governments 
and tribal communities to advocate for the child’s 
well-being during the trauma of  a child custody 
proceeding,” said NARF Staff  Attorney Beth 
Wright.In April 2021, the Fifth Circuit issued a 
315-page collection of  opinions that generally 
affirmed the constitutionality of  ICWA. However, 
certain provisions of  ICWA were deemed to 
be unconstitutional by slim majorities of  that 
court, while an equally divided (8-to-8) court 
left in place the lower court’s decision with 
regard to other parts of  ICWA. Despite the 
ruling’s length, the court’s opinion was unclear or 
inconclusive on many issues, and it ended with 
some of  the court’s judges characterizing the 
entire episode as an “advisory” opinion that was 
not binding in state or tribal courts.  The Fifth 
Circuit’s ambiguous interpretation of  ICWA―an 
act of  Congress nearly 42 years old―presented 
a likely opportunity for the Supreme Court to 
grant review of  the case.  The parties filed their 
petitions for certiorari in late 2021. AT THE SUPREME COURT
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Brackeen v. Haaland  
resulted in four separate petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, with each petition 
presenting the questions of  the case differently.  
In February 2022, the Court granted all four 
petitions, meaning that the Court will consider 
an unusually complex array of  arguments—four 
distinct constitutional questions, some with multiple 
subparts. With the stakes this high, and a case 
this complex, Brackeen  has attracted a tremendous 
amount of  interest from Native and non-Native 
advocates around the country. Eight “friend of  the 
court” briefs (amicus briefs) were recently filed with 
the Supreme Court supporting the plaintiffs and 
opposing ICWA. The briefs supporting ICWA are 
due later this summer, and the coalition of  tribes, 
states, child welfare organizations, and professors 
will likely be joined by children’s rights advocates, 
parents’ rights advocates, foster families and others, 
and there could be 20 or more amicus briefs. Add 
that to the briefs by the United States and the 
intervenor tribes, and the pro-ICWA side will likely 
combine to put more than 150,000 words of  pro-
ICWA argument in front of  the Court. 
Working to coordinate this extensive team of  
pro-ICWA supporters is the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project (https://sct.narf.org), a joint project 
between the Native American Rights Fund and 
the National Congress of  American Indians. 
The Tribal Supreme Court Project draws on the 
collective wisdom and experience of  more than 
300 Indian law attorneys and academics from 
around the country. The Project helps the parties in 
Indian cases before the Supreme Court formulate 
and execute an amicus strategy, working to ensure 
consistent and efficient messaging among the 
parties and their supporting amici. “This is likely 
the most complex case that the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project has ever assisted with,” said NARF 
Staff  Attorney Dan Lewerenz, who is leading the 
Project’s efforts in Brackeen . “We have so much 
support from around the country in this case, which 
is a challenge—but a good challenge.  Our task is 
to make sure the Court doesn’t get overwhelmed 
by the volume, but instead sees all of  that support 
fitting into the complex puzzle this case creates.”NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
WHAT’S NEXT?
All amicus briefs in support of  ICWA are due to 
the Supreme Court in August 2022. The Court has 
not yet scheduled oral argument, but it likely will be 
held in November of  2022. However, preparations 
are well under way, and there are several actions that 
supporters can take right now to ensure the best 
outcome possible. Below, please see how you can voice your support 
of  ICWA and make sure the tribal families and 
children are best supported for long-term success.

To strengthen protections for Native peoples’ 
sacred places in the United States, the Native 
American Rights Fund (NARF) has launched a 
new Sacred Places project, entitled Sacred Places 
Protection: Fulfilling U.S. Religious Freedom 
Promises to Native Peoples. “Since its inception, 
NARF has worked to protect Native sacred sites, 
lands, and the free expression of  Native religion. 
Native peoples in the U.S. have long relied on 
tribal sovereignty, treaties, and religious freedom 
law to protect sacred places,” said NARF Staff  
Attorney Brett Lee Shelton. “What we’re finding 
is sacred place protection needs rethinking in 
courts, and NARF’s Sacred Places Protection 
Project aims to begin that re-envisioning process.”
The three-year project will identify failings to 
protect Native sacred places in existing law 
and policy and suggest solutions grounded in 
Indigenous knowledge and developed by Native 
culture bearers. Existing laws, policies, and sacred 
places protections all use language not centered 
in Indigenous thinking. “American religious 
freedom law frequently harms the free exercise of  
Native religions by constricting interpretation to 
beliefs only and excluding the exercise of  religious 
liberties and the protection of  religious edifices 
and locations, which all other segments of  society 
have,” Shelton explained.
Advancing sacred places protection requires 
creative, strategic, and collaborative rethinking of  
fundamental language and practices. To guide and lead this work, NARF formed a team of  Native 
traditional knowledge bearers and intellectual 
leaders whose lives are devoted to this work. That 
team includes Senior Policy Advisor Suzan Harjo 
(Cheyenne & Hodulgee Muscogee), and project 
Advisory Circle members Joe Garcia (Ohkay 
Owingeh), Tina Kuckkahn (Lac du Flambeau 
Ojibwe), Hon. Delbert Smutcoom Miller 
(Skokomish), and Lois Risling (Hoopa).
The Advisory Circle will direct NARF’s Sacred 
Places Project towards developing a common 
approach to the defense of  Native sacred lands, 
waters, and place-based ceremonies. “With the 
leadership of  traditional knowledge bearers, 
Native intellectuals, and cultural rights specialists, 
the Sacred Places Project will create model 
consent agreements, best practices papers, and 
other tools to ensure Native peoples can continue 
to use their sacred places and have measures ready 
to effectively respond to emergencies that threaten 
and endanger them,” said Shelton.
Support from the Henry Luce Foundation will 
allow the Sacred Places Advisory Circle and 
project staff  to encourage new scholarship 
by convening Native and non-Native thought 
leaders on the topic of  sacred site protections. 
The funding will also allow the project to begin 
conducting professional development activities 
and producing outreach materials on sacred places 
protection, later in 2022 . 

Tribal Supreme 
Court Project
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of  the 
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and is staffed 
by the National Congress of  American Indians and 
the Native American Rights Fund. The Project was 
formed in 2001 in response to a series of  US Supreme 
Court cases that negatively affected tribal sovereignty. 
The purpose of  the Project is to promote greater 
coordination and to improve strategy on litigation that 
may affect the rights of  all Indian tribes. We encourage 
Indian tribes and their attorneys to contact the Project 
to coordinate resources, develop strategy and prepare 
briefs, especially at the time of  the petition for a writ of  
certiorari , prior to the Supreme Court accepting a case 
for review. You can find copies of  briefs and opinions 
on the major cases we track on the NARF website: 
https://sct.narf.org . 
Since the last update, the Court has granted two 
additional cases: Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (21-429)  
(state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country), and 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376)  (Indian Child Welfare Act). 
Castro-Huerta was argued on April 27, 2022, and we 
expect the Court to hand-down its decision before it 
departs for its summer recess. Brackeen will be argued 
sometime in the October Term 2022. We are also 
awaiting decisions in Denezpi v. United States (20-7622) 
(Double Jeopardy) and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas (20-
493) (Indian gaming). These cases are detailed further 
below.
PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI GRANTED
The Court has granted review in the following cases:
DENEZPI V. UNITED STATESDENEZPI V. UNITED STATES  (20-7622): 
Petitioner Merle Denezpi is a Navajo Nation citizen and 
was convicted of  a tribal law assault-and-battery charge 
by the Court of  Indian Offenses of  the Ute Mountain 
Ute Agency and served 140 days of  imprisonment. Six 
months later, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of  aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country. 
He moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it 
violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he was 
convicted of  the same offense in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses. The district court denied the motion to 
dismiss, and he was convicted after a trial. The Tenth 
Circuit affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy 
Clause was not violated because the “ultimate source” 
of  Mr. Denezpi’s prosecution in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses was the tribe’s inherent sovereignty. The 
court reasoned that Congress’s creation of  the court 
provided a forum through which the tribe could 
exercise its power of  self-governance.  
YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS (20-493):  
The State of  Texas sued the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
(Pueblo), seeking to enjoin it from engaging in certain 
gaming as a violation of  Texas law. In 1987, Congress 
passed an act restoring federal recognition of  the 
Pueblo, which provided that the Pueblo may not 
conduct gaming that is prohibited under Texas law. 
Congress subsequently passed the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act (IGRA), which is more permissive of  
tribal gaming operations than the Pueblo’s restoration 
act. Texas and the Pueblo have disagreed ever since 
about whether the restoration act or IGRA control 
the Pueblo’s gaming operations. In 1993, the Fifth 
Circuit sided with Texas and held that the restoration 
act controlled. In the instant lawsuit, Texas argued 
that the Pueblo’s games violated Texas law. Relying on 
its 1993 case, the Fifth Circuit agreed and held that 
“the Restoration Act ‘govern[s] the determination of  
whether gaming activities proposed by the [ ] Pueblo 
are allowed under Texas law, which functions as 
surrogate federal law.’”
OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429)OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429) : 
Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian, was convicted in 
Oklahoma state court of  offenses stemming from 
the neglect of  an Indian child. His conviction was 
on appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court decided 
PAGE 8 NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
McGirt v. Oklahoma , and the Oklahoma Court 
of  Criminal Appeals remanded to the trial court 
for a determination of  whether Oklahoma 
possessed jurisdiction over the crime. The trial 
court concluded that it did not because there was 
an Indian victim and the crime occurred within 
the Cherokee Nation reservation. The Oklahoma 
Court of  Criminal Appeals affirmed, and the U.S. 
Supreme Court granted review on the question of  
whether a state possesses concurrent jurisdiction 
over crimes that the United States may prosecute 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1152. Several petitions that 
raise the same or related questions are list below 
under “Petitions for a Writ of  Certiorari Pending.”
Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland 
(21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); (21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):  
A Texas couple wishing to adopt an Indian child, 
and the State of  Texas, filed suit against the United 
States and several of  its agencies and officers in 
federal district court claiming that the Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) was unconstitutional. They 
were joined by additional individual plaintiffs and 
the States of  Louisiana and Indiana. Cherokee 
Nation, Oneida Nation, Quinault Indian Nation, 
and Morongo Band of  Mission Indians (collectively 
the Four Tribes) intervened as defendants, and 
Navajo Nation intervened at the appellate stage. 
The district court held that much of  ICWA was 
unconstitutional, but the Fifth Circuit, sitting en 
banc, reversed much of  that decision.  However, the 
Fifth Circuit did affirm the district court on some of  
its holdings that specific sections of  ICWA violated 
the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee 
and the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering 
principle. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit by an equally 
divide court affirmed the district court’s holding 
that ICWA’s preference for placing Indian children 
with “other Indian families” (ICWA’s third adoptive 
preference, after family placement and placement 
with the child’s tribe) and the foster care preference 
for licensed Indian foster homes violated equal 
protection. The Fifth Circuit also concluded that the 
Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering  principle 
was violated by ICWA’s “active efforts,” “qualified 
expert witness,” and record keeping requirements, and an equally divided court affirmed the district 
court’s holdings that placement preferences 
and notice requirements would violate the anti-
commandeering principle if  applied to State agencies. 
Finally, the Fifth Circuit also held that certain 
provisions of  the ICWA Final Rule, specifically those 
related to the provisions that the Court had found 
to be unconstitutional, violated the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
The United States, the Four Tribes, Texas, and the 
non-Indian individuals each filed petitions for review 
at the U.S. Supreme Court. The United States and the 
Four Tribes seek review of  the Fifth Circuit’s finding 
of  unconstitutionality based on Equal Protection and 
anti-commandeering and the corresponding findings 
of  APA violations, and assert that the individual 
plaintiffs lack standing.  In its petition, Texas asserts 
that Congress acted beyond its Indian Commerce 
Clause power in enacting ICWA and that ICWA 
creates a race-based child custody system in violation 
of  the Equal Protection clause. Texas claims that 
ICWA violates the anti-commandeering principle 
and that its implementing regulations violate the 
nondelegation doctrine by allowing individual 
tribes to alter the placement preferences enacted 
by Congress. The individual plaintiffs focus their 
petition more narrowly on equal protection and
anti-commandeering claims.

Yocha Dehe Wintun NationIt has been made abundantly clear that non-Indian philan -
thropy cannot sustain NARF’s work. Federal funds for 
specific projects also have been reduced. To provide legal 
advocacy in a wide variety of  areas such as religious free -
dom, the Tribal Supreme Court Project, tribal recognition, 
human rights, trust responsibility, voting rights, tribal water 
rights, Indian Child Welfare Act, and tribal sovereignty 
issues, NARF looks to the tribes to provide the needed 
funding. It is an honor to list those tribes and Native or -
ganizations who have chosen to share their good fortunes 
with the Native American Rights Fund and the thousands 
of  Indian clients that we serve. 
We encourage other tribes and organizations to become 
contributors and partners with NARF in fighting for 
justice for our people and in keeping the vision of  our 
ancestors alive. We thank the following tribes and Native 
organizations for their generous support of  NARF so far

independence on reservations, and protect their sovereignty. 
An adequate land base and control over natural resources 
are central components of  economic self-sufficiency and 
and self-determination, and are vital to the very existence of  
tribes. Thus, much of  NARF’s work involves protecting tribal 
natural resources. Although basic human rights are considered 
a universal and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face 
the ongoing threat of  having their rights undermined by the 
United States government, states, and others who seek to limit 
these rights. Under the priority of  promoting human rights, 
NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that protect 
the rights of  Native Americans to practice their traditional 
religion, use their languages, and enjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between 
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent duty 
for all levels of  government to recognize and responsibly 
enforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. 
Because such laws impact virtually every aspect of  tribal life, 
NARF is committed to holding governments accountable 
to Native Americans. Developing Indian law and educating 
the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential 
for the continued protection of  Indian rights. This primarily 
involves establishing favorable court precedents, distributing 
information and law materials, encouraging and fostering 
Indian legal education, and forming alliances with Indian law 
practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to NARF’s 
main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302. NARF’s 
clients are expected to pay what they can toward the costs of  
legal representation.The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is the oldest and 
largest nonprofit legal organization defending and promoting 
the legal rights of  Indian people on issues essential to their 
tribal sovereignty, natural resources, and human rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided specialized legal advice and 
representation to Native American tribes and organizations on 
issues of  major importance. Our early work was instrumental 
in establishing the field of  Indian law. NARF—when very few 
would—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious freedom 
and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, as 
well as basic human and civil rights. We continue to take on 
complex, time-consuming cases that others avoid, such as 
government accountability, voting rights, climate change, and 
the education of  our children. We have assisted more than 300 
tribal nations with critical issues that go to the heart of  who 
we are as sovereign nations.
NARF’s first Board of  Directors developed priorities to 
guide the organization in its mission to preserve and enforce 
the legal rights of  Native Americans. Those five priorities 
continue to lead NARF today:
• Preserve tribal existence
• Protect tribal natural resources
• Promote Native American human rights
• Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
• Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian 
rights, laws, and issues
Under preserving tribal existence, NARF works to construct 
the foundations that empower tribes to live according 
to their traditions, enforce their treaty rights, insure their The Native American Rights Fund

NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
Brackeen  Headed to the U.S. Supreme Court
The U.S. Supreme Court in its next term will 
hear potentially the most important Indian law 
case in a generation when it decides whether 
Congress exceeded its constitutional powers when 
it enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of  1978 
(ICWA). 
ICWA sets minimum federal standards for child 
custody proceedings involving any child who 
is a member of  a federally recognized tribe (or 
who is both eligible for tribal membership and 
the biological child of  a tribal member).  Child 
welfare advocates have long considered ICWA the 
gold standard in child welfare practice. However, 
in the case that is now known as Brackeen v. 
Haaland , plaintiffs who oppose ICWA alleged 
that ICWA is unconstitutional for a variety of  
reasons. The U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit issued a split decision, and parties on both 
sides filed a total of  four petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court: one from the United 
States, one from four intervening tribes (Cherokee 
Nation, Morongo Band of  Mission Indians, 
Oneida Nation, and Quinault Indian Nation), 
one from the State of  Texas, and one from 
individuals who sought to adopt Indian children.  
In February 2022, the Supreme Court granted all 
four petitions and consolidated them under the 
caption Haaland v. Brackeen . 
The case before the Supreme Court presents 
multiple constitutional questions. Its outcome 
could have far-reaching effects for Native families 
and tribes. “In a coordinated, well-financed, 
direct attack, Texas and other opponents aim 
to simultaneously exploit Native children while undermining the law that protects them—
all while potentially undermining the entire 
framework of  federal-tribal relations. If  they 
succeed in weakening protections for Native 
children it could negatively impact Native families 
and tribes for generations,” said Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) Senior Staff  Attorney Erin 
Dougherty Lynch.

PAGE 2NARF LEGAL REVIEWRENEWED INTEREST IN ICWA
Although ICWA became law in 1978, throughout 
its history, states routinely applied its provisions 
inconsistently. To ensure uniformity and that best 
practices were used, child welfare advocates and 
tribes called on the federal government to update 
ICWA’s guidelines. In 2015, the Department of  
the Interior (Interior) did just that. The following 
year, after reviewing thousands of  comments from 
tribes, states, and child welfare agencies, Interior 
also promulgated legally binding ICWA regulations 
(the Final Rule). In the wake of  these agency 
actions, the coordinated attack on ICWA began.
With the goal of  erasing ICWA and dismantling 
tribal sovereignty, many anti-tribal-sovereignty 
interests came together to establish an unlikely 
alliance. Adoption attorneys opposed the revised 
guidelines and efforts to increase regulation and 
oversight of  their highly profitable industry.  
The Goldwater Institute and a handful of  states 
opposed the Final Rule because it affirmed tribes’ 
authority and responsibility as sovereign nations 
to safeguard their citizens. And a fringe subset 
of  foster-family advocates opposed the Final 
Rule as part of  a broader effort to expand foster 
parents’ rights. Throughout the subsequent years 
of  litigation in various federal courts, this coalition 
built of  anti-tribal sovereignty interests coordinated 
their efforts to strike down child welfare protections 
for tribal citizens and attack tribal sovereignty at its 
core. TAKING IT TO THE COURTS
Although federal courts rarely hear ICWA-related 
cases, which typically fall under state or tribal 
jurisdiction, after the release of  the 2016 Final Rule, 
anti-ICWA forces filed lawsuits in various federal 
courts across the country. In 2017, anti-ICWA 
forces found a friendly venue in one division of  
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of  Texas, where that division’s sole civil judge 
has a history of  consistently overturning federal 
statutes. In October 2018, that judge issued a ruling 
invalidating many of  ICWA’s provisions. With this 
unprecedented ruling, the case headed to the U.S. 
Circuit Court of  Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
THE ROAD TO THE SUPREME COURT 
The Fifth Circuit includes the states of  Texas, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana.These states’ geographic 
boundaries contain few federally recognized 
tribes, and these states have limited experience 
in tribal-state coordination. In the Fifth Circuit’s 
August 2019 three-judge panel ruling, the tribes 
and federal government prevailed on most of  
the issues asserted in the case, including equal 
protection, commandeering, non-delegation, and 
the Administrative Procedures Act. However, when 
an en banc review (review by the entire court instead 
of  just a three-judge panel) was requested, the 
court granted this request and held additional oral 
arguments in January 2020. 
By that time, the coalition supporting ICWA had 
grown impressively large. The Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) and its colleagues at the law 
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
PAGE 3VOLUME 47 NO. 1firm Dentons represented 486 tribes and 59 tribal 
organizations on a brief  in support of  ICWA, 
explaining its essential history and the Indian 
child welfare crisis that led Congress to enact the 
law.  Briefs in support of  ICWA came in from, 
among others, a bipartisan coalition of  26 states 
and the District of  Columbia, who described how 
ICWA is a critical tool that fosters state-tribal 
collaboration without improperly commandeering 
state agencies or courts; almost 30 leading child 
welfare organizations (including the Children’s 
Defense Fund, Adopt America Network, Child 
Welfare League of  America, Casey Family 
Programs, and FosterClub), who explained how 
ICWA exemplifies social work best practices that 
result in better outcomes for children; a bipartisan 
group of  members of  Congress, who explained 
why ICWA was a proper exercise of  Congress’s 
constitutional powers; and professors and scholars 
from across a variety of  fields. 
“Social workers, child psychologists, children’s 
advocates, adoption and foster care advocates, and 
tribes all support ICWA because the Act provides 
the gold-standard level of  protection for Native 
children.  ICWA also allows tribal governments 
and tribal communities to advocate for the child’s 
well-being during the trauma of  a child custody 
proceeding,” said NARF Staff  Attorney Beth 
Wright.In April 2021, the Fifth Circuit issued a 
315-page collection of  opinions that generally 
affirmed the constitutionality of  ICWA. However, 
certain provisions of  ICWA were deemed to 
be unconstitutional by slim majorities of  that 
court, while an equally divided (8-to-8) court 
left in place the lower court’s decision with 
regard to other parts of  ICWA. Despite the 
ruling’s length, the court’s opinion was unclear or 
inconclusive on many issues, and it ended with 
some of  the court’s judges characterizing the 
entire episode as an “advisory” opinion that was 
not binding in state or tribal courts.  The Fifth 
Circuit’s ambiguous interpretation of  ICWA―an 
act of  Congress nearly 42 years old―presented 
a likely opportunity for the Supreme Court to 
grant review of  the case.  The parties filed their 
petitions for certiorari in late 2021. AT THE SUPREME COURT
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Brackeen v. Haaland  
resulted in four separate petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, with each petition 
presenting the questions of  the case differently.  
In February 2022, the Court granted all four 
petitions, meaning that the Court will consider 
an unusually complex array of  arguments—four 
distinct constitutional questions, some with multiple 
subparts. With the stakes this high, and a case 
this complex, Brackeen  has attracted a tremendous 
amount of  interest from Native and non-Native 
advocates around the country. Eight “friend of  the 
court” briefs (amicus briefs) were recently filed with 
the Supreme Court supporting the plaintiffs and 
opposing ICWA. The briefs supporting ICWA are 
due later this summer, and the coalition of  tribes, 
states, child welfare organizations, and professors 
will likely be joined by children’s rights advocates, 
parents’ rights advocates, foster families and others, 
and there could be 20 or more amicus briefs. Add 
that to the briefs by the United States and the 
intervenor tribes, and the pro-ICWA side will likely 
combine to put more than 150,000 words of  pro-
ICWA argument in front of  the Court. 
Working to coordinate this extensive team of  
pro-ICWA supporters is the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project (https://sct.narf.org), a joint project 
between the Native American Rights Fund and 
the National Congress of  American Indians. 
The Tribal Supreme Court Project draws on the 
collective wisdom and experience of  more than 
300 Indian law attorneys and academics from 
around the country. The Project helps the parties in 
Indian cases before the Supreme Court formulate 
and execute an amicus strategy, working to ensure 
consistent and efficient messaging among the 
parties and their supporting amici. “This is likely 
the most complex case that the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project has ever assisted with,” said NARF 
Staff  Attorney Dan Lewerenz, who is leading the 
Project’s efforts in Brackeen . “We have so much 
support from around the country in this case, which 
is a challenge—but a good challenge.  Our task is 
to make sure the Court doesn’t get overwhelmed 
by the volume, but instead sees all of  that support 
fitting into the complex puzzle this case creates.”NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
WHAT’S NEXT?
All amicus briefs in support of  ICWA are due to 
the Supreme Court in August 2022. The Court has 
not yet scheduled oral argument, but it likely will be 
held in November of  2022. However, preparations 
are well under way, and there are several actions that 
supporters can take right now to ensure the best 
outcome possible. Below, please see how you can voice your support 
of  ICWA and make sure the tribal families and 
children are best supported for long-term success.

To strengthen protections for Native peoples’ 
sacred places in the United States, the Native 
American Rights Fund (NARF) has launched a 
new Sacred Places project, entitled Sacred Places 
Protection: Fulfilling U.S. Religious Freedom 
Promises to Native Peoples. “Since its inception, 
NARF has worked to protect Native sacred sites, 
lands, and the free expression of  Native religion. 
Native peoples in the U.S. have long relied on 
tribal sovereignty, treaties, and religious freedom 
law to protect sacred places,” said NARF Staff  
Attorney Brett Lee Shelton. “What we’re finding 
is sacred place protection needs rethinking in 
courts, and NARF’s Sacred Places Protection 
Project aims to begin that re-envisioning process.”
The three-year project will identify failings to 
protect Native sacred places in existing law 
and policy and suggest solutions grounded in 
Indigenous knowledge and developed by Native 
culture bearers. Existing laws, policies, and sacred 
places protections all use language not centered 
in Indigenous thinking. “American religious 
freedom law frequently harms the free exercise of  
Native religions by constricting interpretation to 
beliefs only and excluding the exercise of  religious 
liberties and the protection of  religious edifices 
and locations, which all other segments of  society 
have,” Shelton explained.
Advancing sacred places protection requires 
creative, strategic, and collaborative rethinking of  
fundamental language and practices. To guide and lead this work, NARF formed a team of  Native 
traditional knowledge bearers and intellectual 
leaders whose lives are devoted to this work. That 
team includes Senior Policy Advisor Suzan Harjo 
(Cheyenne & Hodulgee Muscogee), and project 
Advisory Circle members Joe Garcia (Ohkay 
Owingeh), Tina Kuckkahn (Lac du Flambeau 
Ojibwe), Hon. Delbert Smutcoom Miller 
(Skokomish), and Lois Risling (Hoopa).
The Advisory Circle will direct NARF’s Sacred 
Places Project towards developing a common 
approach to the defense of  Native sacred lands, 
waters, and place-based ceremonies. “With the 
leadership of  traditional knowledge bearers, 
Native intellectuals, and cultural rights specialists, 
the Sacred Places Project will create model 
consent agreements, best practices papers, and 
other tools to ensure Native peoples can continue 
to use their sacred places and have measures ready 
to effectively respond to emergencies that threaten 
and endanger them,” said Shelton.
Support from the Henry Luce Foundation will 
allow the Sacred Places Advisory Circle and 
project staff  to encourage new scholarship 
by convening Native and non-Native thought 
leaders on the topic of  sacred site protections. 
The funding will also allow the project to begin 
conducting professional development activities 
and producing outreach materials on sacred places 
protection, later in 2022 . 

Tribal Supreme 
Court Project
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of  the 
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and is staffed 
by the National Congress of  American Indians and 
the Native American Rights Fund. The Project was 
formed in 2001 in response to a series of  US Supreme 
Court cases that negatively affected tribal sovereignty. 
The purpose of  the Project is to promote greater 
coordination and to improve strategy on litigation that 
may affect the rights of  all Indian tribes. We encourage 
Indian tribes and their attorneys to contact the Project 
to coordinate resources, develop strategy and prepare 
briefs, especially at the time of  the petition for a writ of  
certiorari , prior to the Supreme Court accepting a case 
for review. You can find copies of  briefs and opinions 
on the major cases we track on the NARF website: 
https://sct.narf.org . 
Since the last update, the Court has granted two 
additional cases: Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (21-429)  
(state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country), and 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376)  (Indian Child Welfare Act). 
Castro-Huerta was argued on April 27, 2022, and we 
expect the Court to hand-down its decision before it 
departs for its summer recess. Brackeen will be argued 
sometime in the October Term 2022. We are also 
awaiting decisions in Denezpi v. United States (20-7622) 
(Double Jeopardy) and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas (20-
493) (Indian gaming). These cases are detailed further 
below.
PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI GRANTED
The Court has granted review in the following cases:
DENEZPI V. UNITED STATESDENEZPI V. UNITED STATES  (20-7622): 
Petitioner Merle Denezpi is a Navajo Nation citizen and 
was convicted of  a tribal law assault-and-battery charge 
by the Court of  Indian Offenses of  the Ute Mountain 
Ute Agency and served 140 days of  imprisonment. Six 
months later, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of  aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country. 
He moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it 
violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he was 
convicted of  the same offense in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses. The district court denied the motion to 
dismiss, and he was convicted after a trial. The Tenth 
Circuit affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy 
Clause was not violated because the “ultimate source” 
of  Mr. Denezpi’s prosecution in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses was the tribe’s inherent sovereignty. The 
court reasoned that Congress’s creation of  the court 
provided a forum through which the tribe could 
exercise its power of  self-governance.  
YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS (20-493):  
The State of  Texas sued the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
(Pueblo), seeking to enjoin it from engaging in certain 
gaming as a violation of  Texas law. In 1987, Congress 
passed an act restoring federal recognition of  the 
Pueblo, which provided that the Pueblo may not 
conduct gaming that is prohibited under Texas law. 
Congress subsequently passed the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act (IGRA), which is more permissive of  
tribal gaming operations than the Pueblo’s restoration 
act. Texas and the Pueblo have disagreed ever since 
about whether the restoration act or IGRA control 
the Pueblo’s gaming operations. In 1993, the Fifth 
Circuit sided with Texas and held that the restoration 
act controlled. In the instant lawsuit, Texas argued 
that the Pueblo’s games violated Texas law. Relying on 
its 1993 case, the Fifth Circuit agreed and held that 
“the Restoration Act ‘govern[s] the determination of  
whether gaming activities proposed by the [ ] Pueblo 
are allowed under Texas law, which functions as 
surrogate federal law.’”
OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429)OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429) : 
Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian, was convicted in 
Oklahoma state court of  offenses stemming from 
the neglect of  an Indian child. His conviction was 
on appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court decided 
PAGE 8 NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
McGirt v. Oklahoma , and the Oklahoma Court 
of  Criminal Appeals remanded to the trial court 
for a determination of  whether Oklahoma 
possessed jurisdiction over the crime. The trial 
court concluded that it did not because there was 
an Indian victim and the crime occurred within 
the Cherokee Nation reservation. The Oklahoma 
Court of  Criminal Appeals affirmed, and the U.S. 
Supreme Court granted review on the question of  
whether a state possesses concurrent jurisdiction 
over crimes that the United States may prosecute 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1152. Several petitions that 
raise the same or related questions are list below 
under “Petitions for a Writ of  Certiorari Pending.”
Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland 
(21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); (21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):  
A Texas couple wishing to adopt an Indian child, 
and the State of  Texas, filed suit against the United 
States and several of  its agencies and officers in 
federal district court claiming that the Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) was unconstitutional. They 
were joined by additional individual plaintiffs and 
the States of  Louisiana and Indiana. Cherokee 
Nation, Oneida Nation, Quinault Indian Nation, 
and Morongo Band of  Mission Indians (collectively 
the Four Tribes) intervened as defendants, and 
Navajo Nation intervened at the appellate stage. 
The district court held that much of  ICWA was 
unconstitutional, but the Fifth Circuit, sitting en 
banc, reversed much of  that decision.  However, the 
Fifth Circuit did affirm the district court on some of  
its holdings that specific sections of  ICWA violated 
the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee 
and the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering 
principle. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit by an equally 
divide court affirmed the district court’s holding 
that ICWA’s preference for placing Indian children 
with “other Indian families” (ICWA’s third adoptive 
preference, after family placement and placement 
with the child’s tribe) and the foster care preference 
for licensed Indian foster homes violated equal 
protection. The Fifth Circuit also concluded that the 
Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering  principle 
was violated by ICWA’s “active efforts,” “qualified 
expert witness,” and record keeping requirements, and an equally divided court affirmed the district 
court’s holdings that placement preferences 
and notice requirements would violate the anti-
commandeering principle if  applied to State agencies. 
Finally, the Fifth Circuit also held that certain 
provisions of  the ICWA Final Rule, specifically those 
related to the provisions that the Court had found 
to be unconstitutional, violated the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
The United States, the Four Tribes, Texas, and the 
non-Indian individuals each filed petitions for review 
at the U.S. Supreme Court. The United States and the 
Four Tribes seek review of  the Fifth Circuit’s finding 
of  unconstitutionality based on Equal Protection and 
anti-commandeering and the corresponding findings 
of  APA violations, and assert that the individual 
plaintiffs lack standing.  In its petition, Texas asserts 
that Congress acted beyond its Indian Commerce 
Clause power in enacting ICWA and that ICWA 
creates a race-based child custody system in violation 
of  the Equal Protection clause. Texas claims that 
ICWA violates the anti-commandeering principle 
and that its implementing regulations violate the 
nondelegation doctrine by allowing individual 
tribes to alter the placement preferences enacted 
by Congress. The individual plaintiffs focus their 
petition more narrowly on equal protection and
anti-commandeering claims.

independence on reservations, and protect their sovereignty. 
An adequate land base and control over natural resources 
are central components of  economic self-sufficiency and 
and self-determination, and are vital to the very existence of  
tribes. Thus, much of  NARF’s work involves protecting tribal 
natural resources. Although basic human rights are considered 
a universal and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face 
the ongoing threat of  having their rights undermined by the 
United States government, states, and others who seek to limit 
these rights. Under the priority of  promoting human rights, 
NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that protect 
the rights of  Native Americans to practice their traditional 
religion, use their languages, and enjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between 
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent duty 
for all levels of  government to recognize and responsibly 
enforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. 
Because such laws impact virtually every aspect of  tribal life, 
NARF is committed to holding governments accountable 
to Native Americans. Developing Indian law and educating 
the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential 
for the continued protection of  Indian rights. This primarily 
involves establishing favorable court precedents, distributing 
information and law materials, encouraging and fostering 
Indian legal education, and forming alliances with Indian law 
practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to NARF’s 
main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302. NARF’s 
clients are expected to pay what they can toward the costs of  
legal representation.The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is the oldest and 
largest nonprofit legal organization defending and promoting 
the legal rights of  Indian people on issues essential to their 
tribal sovereignty, natural resources, and human rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided specialized legal advice and 
representation to Native American tribes and organizations on 
issues of  major importance. Our early work was instrumental 
in establishing the field of  Indian law. NARF—when very few 
would—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious freedom 
and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, as 
well as basic human and civil rights. We continue to take on 
complex, time-consuming cases that others avoid, such as 
government accountability, voting rights, climate change, and 
the education of  our children. We have assisted more than 300 
tribal nations with critical issues that go to the heart of  who 
we are as sovereign nations.
NARF’s first Board of  Directors developed priorities to 
guide the organization in its mission to preserve and enforce 
the legal rights of  Native Americans. Those five priorities 
continue to lead NARF today:
• Preserve tribal existence
• Protect tribal natural resources
• Promote Native American human rights
• Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
• Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian 
rights, laws, and issues
Under preserving tribal existence, NARF works to construct 
the foundations that empower tribes to live according 
to their traditions, enforce their treaty rights, insure their The Native American Rights Fund

Brackeen  Headed to the U.S. Supreme Court
The U.S. Supreme Court in its next term will 
hear potentially the most important Indian law 
case in a generation when it decides whether 
Congress exceeded its constitutional powers when 
it enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of  1978 
(ICWA). 
ICWA sets minimum federal standards for child 
custody proceedings involving any child who 
is a member of  a federally recognized tribe (or 
who is both eligible for tribal membership and 
the biological child of  a tribal member).  Child 
welfare advocates have long considered ICWA the 
gold standard in child welfare practice. However, 
in the case that is now known as Brackeen v. 
Haaland , plaintiffs who oppose ICWA alleged 
that ICWA is unconstitutional for a variety of  
reasons. The U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit issued a split decision, and parties on both 
sides filed a total of  four petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court: one from the United 
States, one from four intervening tribes (Cherokee 
Nation, Morongo Band of  Mission Indians, 
Oneida Nation, and Quinault Indian Nation), 
one from the State of  Texas, and one from 
individuals who sought to adopt Indian children.  
In February 2022, the Supreme Court granted all 
four petitions and consolidated them under the 
caption Haaland v. Brackeen . 
The case before the Supreme Court presents 
multiple constitutional questions. Its outcome 
could have far-reaching effects for Native families 
and tribes. “In a coordinated, well-financed, 
direct attack, Texas and other opponents aim 
to simultaneously exploit Native children while undermining the law that protects them—
all while potentially undermining the entire 
framework of  federal-tribal relations. If  they 
succeed in weakening protections for Native 
children it could negatively impact Native families 
and tribes for generations,” said Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) Senior Staff  Attorney Erin 
Dougherty Lynch.

PAGE 2NARF LEGAL REVIEWRENEWED INTEREST IN ICWA
Although ICWA became law in 1978, throughout 
its history, states routinely applied its provisions 
inconsistently. To ensure uniformity and that best 
practices were used, child welfare advocates and 
tribes called on the federal government to update 
ICWA’s guidelines. In 2015, the Department of  
the Interior (Interior) did just that. The following 
year, after reviewing thousands of  comments from 
tribes, states, and child welfare agencies, Interior 
also promulgated legally binding ICWA regulations 
(the Final Rule). In the wake of  these agency 
actions, the coordinated attack on ICWA began.
With the goal of  erasing ICWA and dismantling 
tribal sovereignty, many anti-tribal-sovereignty 
interests came together to establish an unlikely 
alliance. Adoption attorneys opposed the revised 
guidelines and efforts to increase regulation and 
oversight of  their highly profitable industry.  
The Goldwater Institute and a handful of  states 
opposed the Final Rule because it affirmed tribes’ 
authority and responsibility as sovereign nations 
to safeguard their citizens. And a fringe subset 
of  foster-family advocates opposed the Final 
Rule as part of  a broader effort to expand foster 
parents’ rights. Throughout the subsequent years 
of  litigation in various federal courts, this coalition 
built of  anti-tribal sovereignty interests coordinated 
their efforts to strike down child welfare protections 
for tribal citizens and attack tribal sovereignty at its 
core. TAKING IT TO THE COURTS
Although federal courts rarely hear ICWA-related 
cases, which typically fall under state or tribal 
jurisdiction, after the release of  the 2016 Final Rule, 
anti-ICWA forces filed lawsuits in various federal 
courts across the country. In 2017, anti-ICWA 
forces found a friendly venue in one division of  
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of  Texas, where that division’s sole civil judge 
has a history of  consistently overturning federal 
statutes. In October 2018, that judge issued a ruling 
invalidating many of  ICWA’s provisions. With this 
unprecedented ruling, the case headed to the U.S. 
Circuit Court of  Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
THE ROAD TO THE SUPREME COURT 
The Fifth Circuit includes the states of  Texas, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana.These states’ geographic 
boundaries contain few federally recognized 
tribes, and these states have limited experience 
in tribal-state coordination. In the Fifth Circuit’s 
August 2019 three-judge panel ruling, the tribes 
and federal government prevailed on most of  
the issues asserted in the case, including equal 
protection, commandeering, non-delegation, and 
the Administrative Procedures Act. However, when 
an en banc review (review by the entire court instead 
of  just a three-judge panel) was requested, the 
court granted this request and held additional oral 
arguments in January 2020. 
By that time, the coalition supporting ICWA had 
grown impressively large. The Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) and its colleagues at the law 
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
PAGE 3VOLUME 47 NO. 1firm Dentons represented 486 tribes and 59 tribal 
organizations on a brief  in support of  ICWA, 
explaining its essential history and the Indian 
child welfare crisis that led Congress to enact the 
law.  Briefs in support of  ICWA came in from, 
among others, a bipartisan coalition of  26 states 
and the District of  Columbia, who described how 
ICWA is a critical tool that fosters state-tribal 
collaboration without improperly commandeering 
state agencies or courts; almost 30 leading child 
welfare organizations (including the Children’s 
Defense Fund, Adopt America Network, Child 
Welfare League of  America, Casey Family 
Programs, and FosterClub), who explained how 
ICWA exemplifies social work best practices that 
result in better outcomes for children; a bipartisan 
group of  members of  Congress, who explained 
why ICWA was a proper exercise of  Congress’s 
constitutional powers; and professors and scholars 
from across a variety of  fields. 
“Social workers, child psychologists, children’s 
advocates, adoption and foster care advocates, and 
tribes all support ICWA because the Act provides 
the gold-standard level of  protection for Native 
children.  ICWA also allows tribal governments 
and tribal communities to advocate for the child’s 
well-being during the trauma of  a child custody 
proceeding,” said NARF Staff  Attorney Beth 
Wright.In April 2021, the Fifth Circuit issued a 
315-page collection of  opinions that generally 
affirmed the constitutionality of  ICWA. However, 
certain provisions of  ICWA were deemed to 
be unconstitutional by slim majorities of  that 
court, while an equally divided (8-to-8) court 
left in place the lower court’s decision with 
regard to other parts of  ICWA. Despite the 
ruling’s length, the court’s opinion was unclear or 
inconclusive on many issues, and it ended with 
some of  the court’s judges characterizing the 
entire episode as an “advisory” opinion that was 
not binding in state or tribal courts.  The Fifth 
Circuit’s ambiguous interpretation of  ICWA―an 
act of  Congress nearly 42 years old―presented 
a likely opportunity for the Supreme Court to 
grant review of  the case.  The parties filed their 
petitions for certiorari in late 2021. AT THE SUPREME COURT
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Brackeen v. Haaland  
resulted in four separate petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, with each petition 
presenting the questions of  the case differently.  
In February 2022, the Court granted all four 
petitions, meaning that the Court will consider 
an unusually complex array of  arguments—four 
distinct constitutional questions, some with multiple 
subparts. With the stakes this high, and a case 
this complex, Brackeen  has attracted a tremendous 
amount of  interest from Native and non-Native 
advocates around the country. Eight “friend of  the 
court” briefs (amicus briefs) were recently filed with 
the Supreme Court supporting the plaintiffs and 
opposing ICWA. The briefs supporting ICWA are 
due later this summer, and the coalition of  tribes, 
states, child welfare organizations, and professors 
will likely be joined by children’s rights advocates, 
parents’ rights advocates, foster families and others, 
and there could be 20 or more amicus briefs. Add 
that to the briefs by the United States and the 
intervenor tribes, and the pro-ICWA side will likely 
combine to put more than 150,000 words of  pro-
ICWA argument in front of  the Court. 
Working to coordinate this extensive team of  
pro-ICWA supporters is the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project (https://sct.narf.org), a joint project 
between the Native American Rights Fund and 
the National Congress of  American Indians. 
The Tribal Supreme Court Project draws on the 
collective wisdom and experience of  more than 
300 Indian law attorneys and academics from 
around the country. The Project helps the parties in 
Indian cases before the Supreme Court formulate 
and execute an amicus strategy, working to ensure 
consistent and efficient messaging among the 
parties and their supporting amici. “This is likely 
the most complex case that the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project has ever assisted with,” said NARF 
Staff  Attorney Dan Lewerenz, who is leading the 
Project’s efforts in Brackeen . “We have so much 
support from around the country in this case, which 
is a challenge—but a good challenge.  Our task is 
to make sure the Court doesn’t get overwhelmed 
by the volume, but instead sees all of  that support 
fitting into the complex puzzle this case creates.”NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
WHAT’S NEXT?
All amicus briefs in support of  ICWA are due to 
the Supreme Court in August 2022. The Court has 
not yet scheduled oral argument, but it likely will be 
held in November of  2022. However, preparations 
are well under way, and there are several actions that 
supporters can take right now to ensure the best 
outcome possible. Below, please see how you can voice your support 
of  ICWA and make sure the tribal families and

To strengthen protections for Native peoples’ 
sacred places in the United States, the Native 
American Rights Fund (NARF) has launched a 
new Sacred Places project, entitled Sacred Places 
Protection: Fulfilling U.S. Religious Freedom 
Promises to Native Peoples. “Since its inception, 
NARF has worked to protect Native sacred sites, 
lands, and the free expression of  Native religion. 
Native peoples in the U.S. have long relied on 
tribal sovereignty, treaties, and religious freedom 
law to protect sacred places,” said NARF Staff  
Attorney Brett Lee Shelton. “What we’re finding 
is sacred place protection needs rethinking in 
courts, and NARF’s Sacred Places Protection 
Project aims to begin that re-envisioning process.”
The three-year project will identify failings to 
protect Native sacred places in existing law 
and policy and suggest solutions grounded in 
Indigenous knowledge and developed by Native 
culture bearers. Existing laws, policies, and sacred 
places protections all use language not centered 
in Indigenous thinking. “American religious 
freedom law frequently harms the free exercise of  
Native religions by constricting interpretation to 
beliefs only and excluding the exercise of  religious 
liberties and the protection of  religious edifices 
and locations, which all other segments of  society 
have,” Shelton explained.
Advancing sacred places protection requires 
creative, strategic, and collaborative rethinking of  
fundamental language and practices. To guide and lead this work, NARF formed a team of  Native 
traditional knowledge bearers and intellectual 
leaders whose lives are devoted to this work. That 
team includes Senior Policy Advisor Suzan Harjo 
(Cheyenne & Hodulgee Muscogee), and project 
Advisory Circle members Joe Garcia (Ohkay 
Owingeh), Tina Kuckkahn (Lac du Flambeau 
Ojibwe), Hon. Delbert Smutcoom Miller 
(Skokomish), and Lois Risling (Hoopa).
The Advisory Circle will direct NARF’s Sacred 
Places Project towards developing a common 
approach to the defense of  Native sacred lands, 
waters, and place-based ceremonies. “With the 
leadership of  traditional knowledge bearers, 
Native intellectuals, and cultural rights specialists, 
the Sacred Places Project will create model 
consent agreements, best practices papers, and 
other tools to ensure Native peoples can continue 
to use their sacred places and have measures ready 
to effectively respond to emergencies that threaten 
and endanger them,” said Shelton.
Support from the Henry Luce Foundation will 
allow the Sacred Places Advisory Circle and 
project staff  to encourage new scholarship 
by convening Native and non-Native thought 
leaders on the topic of  sacred site protections. 
The funding will also allow the project to begin 
conducting professional development activities 
and producing outreach materials on sacred places 
protection, later in 2022 . 

Tribal Supreme 
Court Project
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of  the 
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and is staffed 
by the National Congress of  American Indians and 
the Native American Rights Fund. The Project was 
formed in 2001 in response to a series of  US Supreme 
Court cases that negatively affected tribal sovereignty. 
The purpose of  the Project is to promote greater 
coordination and to improve strategy on litigation that 
may affect the rights of  all Indian tribes. We encourage 
Indian tribes and their attorneys to contact the Project 
to coordinate resources, develop strategy and prepare 
briefs, especially at the time of  the petition for a writ of  
certiorari , prior to the Supreme Court accepting a case 
for review. You can find copies of  briefs and opinions 
on the major cases we track on the NARF website: 
https://sct.narf.org . 
Since the last update, the Court has granted two 
additional cases: Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (21-429)  
(state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country), and 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376)  (Indian Child Welfare Act). 
Castro-Huerta was argued on April 27, 2022, and we 
expect the Court to hand-down its decision before it 
departs for its summer recess. Brackeen will be argued 
sometime in the October Term 2022. We are also 
awaiting decisions in Denezpi v. United States (20-7622) 
(Double Jeopardy) and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas (20-
493) (Indian gaming). These cases are detailed further 
below.
PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI GRANTED
The Court has granted review in the following cases:
DENEZPI V. UNITED STATESDENEZPI V. UNITED STATES  (20-7622): 
Petitioner Merle Denezpi is a Navajo Nation citizen and 
was convicted of  a tribal law assault-and-battery charge 
by the Court of  Indian Offenses of  the Ute Mountain 
Ute Agency and served 140 days of  imprisonment. Six 
months later, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of  aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country. 
He moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it 
violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he was 
convicted of  the same offense in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses. The district court denied the motion to 
dismiss, and he was convicted after a trial. The Tenth 
Circuit affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy 
Clause was not violated because the “ultimate source” 
of  Mr. Denezpi’s prosecution in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses was the tribe’s inherent sovereignty. The 
court reasoned that Congress’s creation of  the court 
provided a forum through which the tribe could 
exercise its power of  self-governance.  
YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS (20-493):  
The State of  Texas sued the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
(Pueblo), seeking to enjoin it from engaging in certain 
gaming as a violation of  Texas law. In 1987, Congress 
passed an act restoring federal recognition of  the 
Pueblo, which provided that the Pueblo may not 
conduct gaming that is prohibited under Texas law. 
Congress subsequently passed the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act (IGRA), which is more permissive of  
tribal gaming operations than the Pueblo’s restoration 
act. Texas and the Pueblo have disagreed ever since 
about whether the restoration act or IGRA control 
the Pueblo’s gaming operations. In 1993, the Fifth 
Circuit sided with Texas and held that the restoration 
act controlled. In the instant lawsuit, Texas argued 
that the Pueblo’s games violated Texas law. Relying on 
its 1993 case, the Fifth Circuit agreed and held that 
“the Restoration Act ‘govern[s] the determination of  
whether gaming activities proposed by the [ ] Pueblo 
are allowed under Texas law, which functions as 
surrogate federal law.’”
OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429)OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429) : 
Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian, was convicted in 
Oklahoma state court of  offenses stemming from 
the neglect of  an Indian child. His conviction was 
on appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court decided 
PAGE 8 NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
McGirt v. Oklahoma , and the Oklahoma Court 
of  Criminal Appeals remanded to the trial court 
for a determination of  whether Oklahoma 
possessed jurisdiction over the crime. The trial 
court concluded that it did not because there was 
an Indian victim and the crime occurred within 
the Cherokee Nation reservation. The Oklahoma 
Court of  Criminal Appeals affirmed, and the U.S. 
Supreme Court granted review on the question of  
whether a state possesses concurrent jurisdiction 
over crimes that the United States may prosecute 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1152. Several petitions that 
raise the same or related questions are list below 
under “Petitions for a Writ of  Certiorari Pending.”
Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland 
(21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); (21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):  
A Texas couple wishing to adopt an Indian child, 
and the State of  Texas, filed suit against the United 
States and several of  its agencies and officers in 
federal district court claiming that the Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) was unconstitutional. They 
were joined by additional individual plaintiffs and 
the States of  Louisiana and Indiana. Cherokee 
Nation, Oneida Nation, Quinault Indian Nation, 
and Morongo Band of  Mission Indians (collectively 
the Four Tribes) intervened as defendants, and 
Navajo Nation intervened at the appellate stage. 
The district court held that much of  ICWA was 
unconstitutional, but the Fifth Circuit, sitting en 
banc, reversed much of  that decision.  However, the 
Fifth Circuit did affirm the district court on some of  
its holdings that specific sections of  ICWA violated 
the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee 
and the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering 
principle. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit by an equally 
divide court affirmed the district court’s holding 
that ICWA’s preference for placing Indian children 
with “other Indian families” (ICWA’s third adoptive 
preference, after family placement and placement 
with the child’s tribe) and the foster care preference 
for licensed Indian foster homes violated equal 
protection. The Fifth Circuit also concluded that the 
Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering  principle 
was violated by ICWA’s “active efforts,” “qualified 
expert witness,” and record keeping requirements, and an equally divided court affirmed the district 
court’s holdings that placement preferences 
and notice requirements would violate the anti-
commandeering principle if  applied to State agencies. 
Finally, the Fifth Circuit also held that certain 
provisions of  the ICWA Final Rule, specifically those 
related to the provisions that the Court had found 
to be unconstitutional, violated the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
The United States, the Four Tribes, Texas, and the 
non-Indian individuals each filed petitions for review 
at the U.S. Supreme Court. The United States and the 
Four Tribes seek review of  the Fifth Circuit’s finding 
of  unconstitutionality based on Equal Protection and 
anti-commandeering and the corresponding findings 
of  APA violations, and assert that the individual 
plaintiffs lack standing.  In its petition, Texas asserts 
that Congress acted beyond its Indian Commerce 
Clause power in enacting ICWA and that ICWA 
creates a race-based child custody system in violation 
of  the Equal Protection clause. Texas claims that 
ICWA violates the anti-commandeering principle 
and that its implementing regulations violate the 
nondelegation doctrine by allowing individual 
tribes to alter the placement preferences enacted 
by Congress. The individual plaintiffs focus their 
petition more narrowly on equal protection and
anti-commandeering claims.

independence on reservations, and protect their sovereignty. 
An adequate land base and control over natural resources 
are central components of  economic self-sufficiency and 
and self-determination, and are vital to the very existence of  
tribes. Thus, much of  NARF’s work involves protecting tribal 
natural resources. Although basic human rights are considered 
a universal and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face 
the ongoing threat of  having their rights undermined by the 
United States government, states, and others who seek to limit 
these rights. Under the priority of  promoting human rights, 
NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that protect 
the rights of  Native Americans to practice their traditional 
religion, use their languages, and enjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between 
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent duty 
for all levels of  government to recognize and responsibly 
enforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. 
Because such laws impact virtually every aspect of  tribal life, 
NARF is committed to holding governments accountable 
to Native Americans. Developing Indian law and educating 
the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential 
for the continued protection of  Indian rights. This primarily 
involves establishing favorable court precedents, distributing 
information and law materials, encouraging and fostering 
Indian legal education, and forming alliances with Indian law 
practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to NARF’s 
main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302. NARF’s 
clients are expected to pay what they can toward the costs of  
legal representation.The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is the oldest and 
largest nonprofit legal organization defending and promoting 
the legal rights of  Indian people on issues essential to their 
tribal sovereignty, natural resources, and human rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided specialized legal advice and 
representation to Native American tribes and organizations on 
issues of  major importance. Our early work was instrumental 
in establishing the field of  Indian law. NARF—when very few 
would—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious freedom 
and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, as 
well as basic human and civil rights. We continue to take on 
complex, time-consuming cases that others avoid, such as 
government accountability, voting rights, climate change, and 
the education of  our children. We have assisted more than 300 
tribal nations with critical issues that go to the heart of  who 
we are as sovereign nations.
NARF’s first Board of  Directors developed priorities to 
guide the organization in its mission to preserve and enforce 
the legal rights of  Native Americans. Those five priorities 
continue to lead NARF today:
• Preserve tribal existence
• Protect tribal natural resources
• Promote Native American human rights
• Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
• Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian 
rights, laws, and issues
Under preserving tribal existence, NARF works to construct

to their traditions, enforce their treaty rights, insure their The Native American Rights Fund

Brackeen  Headed to the U.S. Supreme Court
The U.S. Supreme Court in its next term will 
hear potentially the most important Indian law 
case in a generation when it decides whether 
Congress exceeded its constitutional powers when 
it enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of  1978 
(ICWA). 
ICWA sets minimum federal standards for child 
custody proceedings involving any child who 
is a member of  a federally recognized tribe (or 
who is both eligible for tribal membership and 
the biological child of  a tribal member).  Child 
welfare advocates have long considered ICWA the 
gold standard in child welfare practice. However, 
in the case that is now known as Brackeen v. 
Haaland , plaintiffs who oppose ICWA alleged 
that ICWA is unconstitutional for a variety of  
reasons. The U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit issued a split decision, and parties on both 
sides filed a total of  four petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court: one from the United 
States, one from four intervening tribes (Cherokee 
Nation, Morongo Band of  Mission Indians, 
Oneida Nation, and Quinault Indian Nation), 
one from the State of  Texas, and one from 
individuals who sought to adopt Indian children.  
In February 2022, the Supreme Court granted all 
four petitions and consolidated them under the 
caption Haaland v. Brackeen . 
The case before the Supreme Court presents 
multiple constitutional questions. Its outcome 
could have far-reaching effects for Native families 
and tribes. “In a coordinated, well-financed, 
direct attack, Texas and other opponents aim 
to simultaneously exploit Native children while undermining the law that protects them—
all while potentially undermining the entire 
framework of  federal-tribal relations. If  they 
succeed in weakening protections for Native 
children it could negatively impact Native families 
and tribes for generations,” said Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) Senior Staff  Attorney Erin 
Dougherty Lynch.

PAGE 2NARF LEGAL REVIEWRENEWED INTEREST IN ICWA
Although ICWA became law in 1978, throughout 
its history, states routinely applied its provisions 
inconsistently. To ensure uniformity and that best 
practices were used, child welfare advocates and 
tribes called on the federal government to update 
ICWA’s guidelines. In 2015, the Department of  
the Interior (Interior) did just that. The following 
year, after reviewing thousands of  comments from 
tribes, states, and child welfare agencies, Interior 
also promulgated legally binding ICWA regulations 
(the Final Rule). In the wake of  these agency 
actions, the coordinated attack on ICWA began.
With the goal of  erasing ICWA and dismantling 
tribal sovereignty, many anti-tribal-sovereignty 
interests came together to establish an unlikely 
alliance. Adoption attorneys opposed the revised 
guidelines and efforts to increase regulation and 
oversight of  their highly profitable industry.  
The Goldwater Institute and a handful of  states 
opposed the Final Rule because it affirmed tribes’ 
authority and responsibility as sovereign nations 
to safeguard their citizens. And a fringe subset 
of  foster-family advocates opposed the Final 
Rule as part of  a broader effort to expand foster 
parents’ rights. Throughout the subsequent years 
of  litigation in various federal courts, this coalition 
built of  anti-tribal sovereignty interests coordinated 
their efforts to strike down child welfare protections 
for tribal citizens and attack tribal sovereignty at its 
core. TAKING IT TO THE COURTS
Although federal courts rarely hear ICWA-related 
cases, which typically fall under state or tribal 
jurisdiction, after the release of  the 2016 Final Rule, 
anti-ICWA forces filed lawsuits in various federal 
courts across the country. In 2017, anti-ICWA 
forces found a friendly venue in one division of  
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of  Texas, where that division’s sole civil judge 
has a history of  consistently overturning federal 
statutes. In October 2018, that judge issued a ruling 
invalidating many of  ICWA’s provisions. With this 
unprecedented ruling, the case headed to the U.S. 
Circuit Court of  Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
THE ROAD TO THE SUPREME COURT 
The Fifth Circuit includes the states of  Texas, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana.These states’ geographic 
boundaries contain few federally recognized 
tribes, and these states have limited experience 
in tribal-state coordination. In the Fifth Circuit’s 
August 2019 three-judge panel ruling, the tribes 
and federal government prevailed on most of  
the issues asserted in the case, including equal 
protection, commandeering, non-delegation, and 
the Administrative Procedures Act. However, when 
an en banc review (review by the entire court instead 
of  just a three-judge panel) was requested, the 
court granted this request and held additional oral 
arguments in January 2020. 
By that time, the coalition supporting ICWA had 
grown impressively large. The Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) and its colleagues at the law 
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
PAGE 3VOLUME 47 NO. 1firm Dentons represented 486 tribes and 59 tribal 
organizations on a brief  in support of  ICWA, 
explaining its essential history and the Indian 
child welfare crisis that led Congress to enact the 
law.  Briefs in support of  ICWA came in from, 
among others, a bipartisan coalition of  26 states 
and the District of  Columbia, who described how 
ICWA is a critical tool that fosters state-tribal 
collaboration without improperly commandeering 
state agencies or courts; almost 30 leading child 
welfare organizations (including the Children’s 
Defense Fund, Adopt America Network, Child 
Welfare League of  America, Casey Family 
Programs, and FosterClub), who explained how 
ICWA exemplifies social work best practices that 
result in better outcomes for children; a bipartisan 
group of  members of  Congress, who explained 
why ICWA was a proper exercise of  Congress’s 
constitutional powers; and professors and scholars 
from across a variety of  fields. 
“Social workers, child psychologists, children’s 
advocates, adoption and foster care advocates, and 
tribes all support ICWA because the Act provides 
the gold-standard level of  protection for Native 
children.  ICWA also allows tribal governments 
and tribal communities to advocate for the child’s 
well-being during the trauma of  a child custody 
proceeding,” said NARF Staff  Attorney Beth 
Wright.In April 2021, the Fifth Circuit issued a 
315-page collection of  opinions that generally 
affirmed the constitutionality of  ICWA. However, 
certain provisions of  ICWA were deemed to 
be unconstitutional by slim majorities of  that 
court, while an equally divided (8-to-8) court 
left in place the lower court’s decision with 
regard to other parts of  ICWA. Despite the 
ruling’s length, the court’s opinion was unclear or 
inconclusive on many issues, and it ended with 
some of  the court’s judges characterizing the 
entire episode as an “advisory” opinion that was 
not binding in state or tribal courts.  The Fifth 
Circuit’s ambiguous interpretation of  ICWA―an 
act of  Congress nearly 42 years old―presented 
a likely opportunity for the Supreme Court to 
grant review of  the case.  The parties filed their 
petitions for certiorari in late 2021. AT THE SUPREME COURT
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Brackeen v. Haaland  
resulted in four separate petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, with each petition 
presenting the questions of  the case differently.  
In February 2022, the Court granted all four 
petitions, meaning that the Court will consider 
an unusually complex array of  arguments—four 
distinct constitutional questions, some with multiple 
subparts. With the stakes this high, and a case 
this complex, Brackeen  has attracted a tremendous 
amount of  interest from Native and non-Native 
advocates around the country. Eight “friend of  the 
court” briefs (amicus briefs) were recently filed with 
the Supreme Court supporting the plaintiffs and 
opposing ICWA. The briefs supporting ICWA are 
due later this summer, and the coalition of  tribes, 
states, child welfare organizations, and professors 
will likely be joined by children’s rights advocates, 
parents’ rights advocates, foster families and others, 
and there could be 20 or more amicus briefs. Add 
that to the briefs by the United States and the 
intervenor tribes, and the pro-ICWA side will likely 
combine to put more than 150,000 words of  pro-
ICWA argument in front of  the Court. 
Working to coordinate this extensive team of  
pro-ICWA supporters is the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project (https://sct.narf.org), a joint project 
between the Native American Rights Fund and 
the National Congress of  American Indians. 
The Tribal Supreme Court Project draws on the 
collective wisdom and experience of  more than 
300 Indian law attorneys and academics from 
around the country. The Project helps the parties in 
Indian cases before the Supreme Court formulate 
and execute an amicus strategy, working to ensure 
consistent and efficient messaging among the 
parties and their supporting amici. “This is likely 
the most complex case that the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project has ever assisted with,” said NARF 
Staff  Attorney Dan Lewerenz, who is leading the 
Project’s efforts in Brackeen . “We have so much 
support from around the country in this case, which 
is a challenge—but a good challenge.  Our task is 
to make sure the Court doesn’t get overwhelmed 
by the volume, but instead sees all of  that support 
fitting into the complex puzzle this case creates.”NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
WHAT’S NEXT?
All amicus briefs in support of  ICWA are due to 
the Supreme Court in August 2022. The Court has 
not yet scheduled oral argument, but it likely will be 
held in November of  2022. However, preparations 
are well under way, and there are several actions that 
supporters can take right now to ensure the best 
outcome possible. Below, please see how you can voice your support 
of  ICWA and make sure the tribal families and 
children are best supported for long-term success.

To strengthen protections for Native peoples’ 
sacred places in the United States, the Native 
American Rights Fund (NARF) has launched a 
new Sacred Places project, entitled Sacred Places 
Protection: Fulfilling U.S. Religious Freedom 
Promises to Native Peoples. “Since its inception, 
NARF has worked to protect Native sacred sites, 
lands, and the free expression of  Native religion. 
Native peoples in the U.S. have long relied on 
tribal sovereignty, treaties, and religious freedom 
law to protect sacred places,” said NARF Staff  
Attorney Brett Lee Shelton. “What we’re finding 
is sacred place protection needs rethinking in 
courts, and NARF’s Sacred Places Protection 
Project aims to begin that re-envisioning process.”
The three-year project will identify failings to 
protect Native sacred places in existing law 
and policy and suggest solutions grounded in 
Indigenous knowledge and developed by Native 
culture bearers. Existing laws, policies, and sacred 
places protections all use language not centered 
in Indigenous thinking. “American religious 
freedom law frequently harms the free exercise of  
Native religions by constricting interpretation to 
beliefs only and excluding the exercise of  religious 
liberties and the protection of  religious edifices 
and locations, which all other segments of  society 
have,” Shelton explained.
Advancing sacred places protection requires 
creative, strategic, and collaborative rethinking of  
fundamental language and practices. To guide and lead this work, NARF formed a team of  Native 
traditional knowledge bearers and intellectual 
leaders whose lives are devoted to this work. That 
team includes Senior Policy Advisor Suzan Harjo 
(Cheyenne & Hodulgee Muscogee), and project 
Advisory Circle members Joe Garcia (Ohkay 
Owingeh), Tina Kuckkahn (Lac du Flambeau 
Ojibwe), Hon. Delbert Smutcoom Miller 
(Skokomish), and Lois Risling (Hoopa).
The Advisory Circle will direct NARF’s Sacred 
Places Project towards developing a common 
approach to the defense of  Native sacred lands, 
waters, and place-based ceremonies. “With the 
leadership of  traditional knowledge bearers, 
Native intellectuals, and cultural rights specialists, 
the Sacred Places Project will create model 
consent agreements, best practices papers, and 
other tools to ensure Native peoples can continue 
to use their sacred places and have measures ready 
to effectively respond to emergencies that threaten 
and endanger them,” said Shelton.
Support from the Henry Luce Foundation will 
allow the Sacred Places Advisory Circle and 
project staff  to encourage new scholarship 
by convening Native and non-Native thought 
leaders on the topic of  sacred site protections. 
The funding will also allow the project to begin 
conducting professional development activities 
and producing outreach materials on sacred places 
protection, later in 2022 . 

Tribal Supreme 
Court Project
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of  the 
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and is staffed 
by the National Congress of  American Indians and 
the Native American Rights Fund. The Project was 
formed in 2001 in response to a series of  US Supreme 
Court cases that negatively affected tribal sovereignty. 
The purpose of  the Project is to promote greater 
coordination and to improve strategy on litigation that 
may affect the rights of  all Indian tribes. We encourage 
Indian tribes and their attorneys to contact the Project 
to coordinate resources, develop strategy and prepare 
briefs, especially at the time of  the petition for a writ of  
certiorari , prior to the Supreme Court accepting a case 
for review. You can find copies of  briefs and opinions 
on the major cases we track on the NARF website: 
https://sct.narf.org . 
Since the last update, the Court has granted two 
additional cases: Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (21-429)  
(state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country), and 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376)  (Indian Child Welfare Act). 
Castro-Huerta was argued on April 27, 2022, and we 
expect the Court to hand-down its decision before it 
departs for its summer recess. Brackeen will be argued 
sometime in the October Term 2022. We are also 
awaiting decisions in Denezpi v. United States (20-7622) 
(Double Jeopardy) and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas (20-
493) (Indian gaming). These cases are detailed further 
below.
PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI GRANTED
The Court has granted review in the following cases:
DENEZPI V. UNITED STATESDENEZPI V. UNITED STATES  (20-7622): 
Petitioner Merle Denezpi is a Navajo Nation citizen and 
was convicted of  a tribal law assault-and-battery charge 
by the Court of  Indian Offenses of  the Ute Mountain 
Ute Agency and served 140 days of  imprisonment. Six 
months later, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of  aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country. 
He moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it 
violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he was 
convicted of  the same offense in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses. The district court denied the motion to 
dismiss, and he was convicted after a trial. The Tenth 
Circuit affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy 
Clause was not violated because the “ultimate source” 
of  Mr. Denezpi’s prosecution in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses was the tribe’s inherent sovereignty. The 
court reasoned that Congress’s creation of  the court 
provided a forum through which the tribe could 
exercise its power of  self-governance.  
YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS (20-493):  
The State of  Texas sued the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
(Pueblo), seeking to enjoin it from engaging in certain 
gaming as a violation of  Texas law. In 1987, Congress 
passed an act restoring federal recognition of  the 
Pueblo, which provided that the Pueblo may not 
conduct gaming that is prohibited under Texas law. 
Congress subsequently passed the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act (IGRA), which is more permissive of  
tribal gaming operations than the Pueblo’s restoration 
act. Texas and the Pueblo have disagreed ever since 
about whether the restoration act or IGRA control 
the Pueblo’s gaming operations. In 1993, the Fifth 
Circuit sided with Texas and held that the restoration 
act controlled. In the instant lawsuit, Texas argued 
that the Pueblo’s games violated Texas law. Relying on 
its 1993 case, the Fifth Circuit agreed and held that 
“the Restoration Act ‘govern[s] the determination of  
whether gaming activities proposed by the [ ] Pueblo 
are allowed under Texas law, which functions as 
surrogate federal law.’”
OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429)OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429) : 
Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian, was convicted in 
Oklahoma state court of  offenses stemming from 
the neglect of  an Indian child. His conviction was 
on appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court decided 
PAGE 8 NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
McGirt v. Oklahoma , and the Oklahoma Court 
of  Criminal Appeals remanded to the trial court 
for a determination of  whether Oklahoma 
possessed jurisdiction over the crime. The trial 
court concluded that it did not because there was 
an Indian victim and the crime occurred within 
the Cherokee Nation reservation. The Oklahoma 
Court of  Criminal Appeals affirmed, and the U.S. 
Supreme Court granted review on the question of  
whether a state possesses concurrent jurisdiction 
over crimes that the United States may prosecute 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1152. Several petitions that 
raise the same or related questions are list below 
under “Petitions for a Writ of  Certiorari Pending.”
Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland 
(21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); (21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):  
A Texas couple wishing to adopt an Indian child, 
and the State of  Texas, filed suit against the United 
States and several of  its agencies and officers in 
federal district court claiming that the Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) was unconstitutional. They 
were joined by additional individual plaintiffs and 
the States of  Louisiana and Indiana. Cherokee 
Nation, Oneida Nation, Quinault Indian Nation, 
and Morongo Band of  Mission Indians (collectively 
the Four Tribes) intervened as defendants, and 
Navajo Nation intervened at the appellate stage. 
The district court held that much of  ICWA was 
unconstitutional, but the Fifth Circuit, sitting en 
banc, reversed much of  that decision.  However, the 
Fifth Circuit did affirm the district court on some of  
its holdings that specific sections of  ICWA violated 
the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee 
and the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering 
principle. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit by an equally 
divide court affirmed the district court’s holding 
that ICWA’s preference for placing Indian children 
with “other Indian families” (ICWA’s third adoptive 
preference, after family placement and placement 
with the child’s tribe) and the foster care preference 
for licensed Indian foster homes violated equal 
protection. The Fifth Circuit also concluded that the 
Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering  principle 
was violated by ICWA’s “active efforts,” “qualified 
expert witness,” and record keeping requirements, and an equally divided court affirmed the district 
court’s holdings that placement preferences 
and notice requirements would violate the anti-
commandeering principle if  applied to State agencies. 
Finally, the Fifth Circuit also held that certain 
provisions of  the ICWA Final Rule, specifically those 
related to the provisions that the Court had found 
to be unconstitutional, violated the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
The United States, the Four Tribes, Texas, and the 
non-Indian individuals each filed petitions for review 
at the U.S. Supreme Court. The United States and the 
Four Tribes seek review of  the Fifth Circuit’s finding 
of  unconstitutionality based on Equal Protection and 
anti-commandeering and the corresponding findings 
of  APA violations, and assert that the individual 
plaintiffs lack standing.  In its petition, Texas asserts 
that Congress acted beyond its Indian Commerce 
Clause power in enacting ICWA and that ICWA 
creates a race-based child custody system in violation 
of  the Equal Protection clause. Texas claims that 
ICWA violates the anti-commandeering principle 
and that its implementing regulations violate the 
nondelegation doctrine by allowing individual 
tribes to alter the placement preferences enacted 
by Congress. The individual plaintiffs focus their 
petition more narrowly on equal protection and
anti-commandeering claims.

specific projects also have been reduced. To provide legal 
advocacy in a wide variety of  areas such as religious free -

independence on reservations, and protect their sovereignty. 
An adequate land base and control over natural resources 
are central components of  economic self-sufficiency and 
and self-determination, and are vital to the very existence of  
tribes. Thus, much of  NARF’s work involves protecting tribal 
natural resources. Although basic human rights are considered 
a universal and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face 
the ongoing threat of  having their rights undermined by the 
United States government, states, and others who seek to limit 
these rights. Under the priority of  promoting human rights, 
NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that protect 
the rights of  Native Americans to practice their traditional 
religion, use their languages, and enjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between 
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent duty 
for all levels of  government to recognize and responsibly 
enforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. 
Because such laws impact virtually every aspect of  tribal life, 
NARF is committed to holding governments accountable 
to Native Americans. Developing Indian law and educating 
the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential 
for the continued protection of  Indian rights. This primarily 
involves establishing favorable court precedents, distributing 
information and law materials, encouraging and fostering 
Indian legal education, and forming alliances with Indian law 
practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to NARF’s 
main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302. NARF’s 
clients are expected to pay what they can toward the costs of  
legal representation.The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is the oldest and 
largest nonprofit legal organization defending and promoting 
the legal rights of  Indian people on issues essential to their 
tribal sovereignty, natural resources, and human rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided specialized legal advice and 
representation to Native American tribes and organizations on 
issues of  major importance. Our early work was instrumental 
in establishing the field of  Indian law. NARF—when very few 
would—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious freedom 
and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, as 
well as basic human and civil rights. We continue to take on 
complex, time-consuming cases that others avoid, such as 
government accountability, voting rights, climate change, and 
the education of  our children. We have assisted more than 300 
tribal nations with critical issues that go to the heart of  who 
we are as sovereign nations.
NARF’s first Board of  Directors developed priorities to 
guide the organization in its mission to preserve and enforce 
the legal rights of  Native Americans. Those five priorities 
continue to lead NARF today:
• Preserve tribal existence
• Protect tribal natural resources
• Promote Native American human rights
• Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
• Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian 
rights, laws, and issues
Under preserving tribal existence, NARF works to construct 
the foundations that empower tribes to live according 
to their traditions, enforce their treaty rights, insure their The Native American Rights Fund

Brackeen  Headed to the U.S. Supreme Court
The U.S. Supreme Court in its next term will 
hear potentially the most important Indian law 
case in a generation when it decides whether 
Congress exceeded its constitutional powers when 
it enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of  1978 
(ICWA). 
ICWA sets minimum federal standards for child 
custody proceedings involving any child who 
is a member of  a federally recognized tribe (or 
who is both eligible for tribal membership and 
the biological child of  a tribal member).  Child 
welfare advocates have long considered ICWA the 
gold standard in child welfare practice. However, 
in the case that is now known as Brackeen v. 
Haaland , plaintiffs who oppose ICWA alleged 
that ICWA is unconstitutional for a variety of  
reasons. The U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit issued a split decision, and parties on both 
sides filed a total of  four petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court: one from the United 
States, one from four intervening tribes (Cherokee 
Nation, Morongo Band of  Mission Indians, 
Oneida Nation, and Quinault Indian Nation), 
one from the State of  Texas, and one from 
individuals who sought to adopt Indian children.  
In February 2022, the Supreme Court granted all 
four petitions and consolidated them under the 
caption Haaland v. Brackeen . 
The case before the Supreme Court presents 
multiple constitutional questions. Its outcome 
could have far-reaching effects for Native families 
and tribes. “In a coordinated, well-financed, 
direct attack, Texas and other opponents aim 
to simultaneously exploit Native children while undermining the law that protects them—
all while potentially undermining the entire 
framework of  federal-tribal relations. If  they 
succeed in weakening protections for Native 
children it could negatively impact Native families 
and tribes for generations,” said Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) Senior Staff  Attorney Erin 
Dougherty Lynch.

PAGE 2NARF LEGAL REVIEWRENEWED INTEREST IN ICWA
Although ICWA became law in 1978, throughout 
its history, states routinely applied its provisions 
inconsistently. To ensure uniformity and that best 
practices were used, child welfare advocates and 
tribes called on the federal government to update 
ICWA’s guidelines. In 2015, the Department of  
the Interior (Interior) did just that. The following 
year, after reviewing thousands of  comments from 
tribes, states, and child welfare agencies, Interior 
also promulgated legally binding ICWA regulations 
(the Final Rule). In the wake of  these agency 
actions, the coordinated attack on ICWA began.
With the goal of  erasing ICWA and dismantling 
tribal sovereignty, many anti-tribal-sovereignty 
interests came together to establish an unlikely 
alliance. Adoption attorneys opposed the revised 
guidelines and efforts to increase regulation and 
oversight of  their highly profitable industry.  
The Goldwater Institute and a handful of  states 
opposed the Final Rule because it affirmed tribes’ 
authority and responsibility as sovereign nations 
to safeguard their citizens. And a fringe subset 
of  foster-family advocates opposed the Final 
Rule as part of  a broader effort to expand foster 
parents’ rights. Throughout the subsequent years 
of  litigation in various federal courts, this coalition 
built of  anti-tribal sovereignty interests coordinated 
their efforts to strike down child welfare protections 
for tribal citizens and attack tribal sovereignty at its 
core. TAKING IT TO THE COURTS
Although federal courts rarely hear ICWA-related 
cases, which typically fall under state or tribal 
jurisdiction, after the release of  the 2016 Final Rule, 
anti-ICWA forces filed lawsuits in various federal 
courts across the country. In 2017, anti-ICWA 
forces found a friendly venue in one division of  
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of  Texas, where that division’s sole civil judge 
has a history of  consistently overturning federal 
statutes. In October 2018, that judge issued a ruling 
invalidating many of  ICWA’s provisions. With this 
unprecedented ruling, the case headed to the U.S. 
Circuit Court of  Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
THE ROAD TO THE SUPREME COURT 
The Fifth Circuit includes the states of  Texas, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana.These states’ geographic 
boundaries contain few federally recognized 
tribes, and these states have limited experience 
in tribal-state coordination. In the Fifth Circuit’s 
August 2019 three-judge panel ruling, the tribes 
and federal government prevailed on most of  
the issues asserted in the case, including equal 
protection, commandeering, non-delegation, and 
the Administrative Procedures Act. However, when 
an en banc review (review by the entire court instead 
of  just a three-judge panel) was requested, the 
court granted this request and held additional oral 
arguments in January 2020. 
By that time, the coalition supporting ICWA had 
grown impressively large. The Native American 
Rights Fund (NARF) and its colleagues at the law 
NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
PAGE 3VOLUME 47 NO. 1firm Dentons represented 486 tribes and 59 tribal 
organizations on a brief  in support of  ICWA, 
explaining its essential history and the Indian 
child welfare crisis that led Congress to enact the 
law.  Briefs in support of  ICWA came in from, 
among others, a bipartisan coalition of  26 states 
and the District of  Columbia, who described how 
ICWA is a critical tool that fosters state-tribal 
collaboration without improperly commandeering 
state agencies or courts; almost 30 leading child 
welfare organizations (including the Children’s 
Defense Fund, Adopt America Network, Child 
Welfare League of  America, Casey Family 
Programs, and FosterClub), who explained how 
ICWA exemplifies social work best practices that 
result in better outcomes for children; a bipartisan 
group of  members of  Congress, who explained 
why ICWA was a proper exercise of  Congress’s 
constitutional powers; and professors and scholars 
from across a variety of  fields. 
“Social workers, child psychologists, children’s 
advocates, adoption and foster care advocates, and 
tribes all support ICWA because the Act provides 
the gold-standard level of  protection for Native 
children.  ICWA also allows tribal governments 
and tribal communities to advocate for the child’s 
well-being during the trauma of  a child custody 
proceeding,” said NARF Staff  Attorney Beth 
Wright.In April 2021, the Fifth Circuit issued a 
315-page collection of  opinions that generally 
affirmed the constitutionality of  ICWA. However, 
certain provisions of  ICWA were deemed to 
be unconstitutional by slim majorities of  that 
court, while an equally divided (8-to-8) court 
left in place the lower court’s decision with 
regard to other parts of  ICWA. Despite the 
ruling’s length, the court’s opinion was unclear or 
inconclusive on many issues, and it ended with 
some of  the court’s judges characterizing the 
entire episode as an “advisory” opinion that was 
not binding in state or tribal courts.  The Fifth 
Circuit’s ambiguous interpretation of  ICWA―an 
act of  Congress nearly 42 years old―presented 
a likely opportunity for the Supreme Court to 
grant review of  the case.  The parties filed their 
petitions for certiorari in late 2021. AT THE SUPREME COURT
The Fifth Circuit’s decision in Brackeen v. Haaland  
resulted in four separate petitions for certiorari 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, with each petition 
presenting the questions of  the case differently.  
In February 2022, the Court granted all four 
petitions, meaning that the Court will consider 
an unusually complex array of  arguments—four 
distinct constitutional questions, some with multiple 
subparts. With the stakes this high, and a case 
this complex, Brackeen  has attracted a tremendous 
amount of  interest from Native and non-Native 
advocates around the country. Eight “friend of  the 
court” briefs (amicus briefs) were recently filed with 
the Supreme Court supporting the plaintiffs and 
opposing ICWA. The briefs supporting ICWA are 
due later this summer, and the coalition of  tribes, 
states, child welfare organizations, and professors 
will likely be joined by children’s rights advocates, 
parents’ rights advocates, foster families and others, 
and there could be 20 or more amicus briefs. Add 
that to the briefs by the United States and the 
intervenor tribes, and the pro-ICWA side will likely 
combine to put more than 150,000 words of  pro-
ICWA argument in front of  the Court. 
Working to coordinate this extensive team of  
pro-ICWA supporters is the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project (https://sct.narf.org), a joint project 
between the Native American Rights Fund and 
the National Congress of  American Indians. 
The Tribal Supreme Court Project draws on the 
collective wisdom and experience of  more than 
300 Indian law attorneys and academics from 
around the country. The Project helps the parties in 
Indian cases before the Supreme Court formulate 
and execute an amicus strategy, working to ensure 
consistent and efficient messaging among the 
parties and their supporting amici. “This is likely 
the most complex case that the Tribal Supreme 
Court Project has ever assisted with,” said NARF 
Staff  Attorney Dan Lewerenz, who is leading the 
Project’s efforts in Brackeen . “We have so much 
support from around the country in this case, which 
is a challenge—but a good challenge.  Our task is 
to make sure the Court doesn’t get overwhelmed 
by the volume, but instead sees all of  that support 
fitting into the complex puzzle this case creates.”NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
WHAT’S NEXT?
All amicus briefs in support of  ICWA are due to 
the Supreme Court in August 2022. The Court has 
not yet scheduled oral argument, but it likely will be 
held in November of  2022. However, preparations 
are well under way, and there are several actions that 
supporters can take right now to ensure the best 
outcome possible. Below, please see how you can voice your support

To strengthen protections for Native peoples’ 
sacred places in the United States, the Native 
American Rights Fund (NARF) has launched a 
new Sacred Places project, entitled Sacred Places 
Protection: Fulfilling U.S. Religious Freedom 
Promises to Native Peoples. “Since its inception, 
NARF has worked to protect Native sacred sites, 
lands, and the free expression of  Native religion. 
Native peoples in the U.S. have long relied on 
tribal sovereignty, treaties, and religious freedom 
law to protect sacred places,” said NARF Staff  
Attorney Brett Lee Shelton. “What we’re finding 
is sacred place protection needs rethinking in 
courts, and NARF’s Sacred Places Protection 
Project aims to begin that re-envisioning process.”
The three-year project will identify failings to 
protect Native sacred places in existing law 
and policy and suggest solutions grounded in 
Indigenous knowledge and developed by Native 
culture bearers. Existing laws, policies, and sacred 
places protections all use language not centered 
in Indigenous thinking. “American religious 
freedom law frequently harms the free exercise of  
Native religions by constricting interpretation to 
beliefs only and excluding the exercise of  religious 
liberties and the protection of  religious edifices 
and locations, which all other segments of  society 
have,” Shelton explained.
Advancing sacred places protection requires 
creative, strategic, and collaborative rethinking of  
fundamental language and practices. To guide and lead this work, NARF formed a team of  Native 
traditional knowledge bearers and intellectual 
leaders whose lives are devoted to this work. That 
team includes Senior Policy Advisor Suzan Harjo 
(Cheyenne & Hodulgee Muscogee), and project 
Advisory Circle members Joe Garcia (Ohkay 
Owingeh), Tina Kuckkahn (Lac du Flambeau 
Ojibwe), Hon. Delbert Smutcoom Miller 
(Skokomish), and Lois Risling (Hoopa).
The Advisory Circle will direct NARF’s Sacred 
Places Project towards developing a common 
approach to the defense of  Native sacred lands, 
waters, and place-based ceremonies. “With the 
leadership of  traditional knowledge bearers, 
Native intellectuals, and cultural rights specialists, 
the Sacred Places Project will create model 
consent agreements, best practices papers, and 
other tools to ensure Native peoples can continue 
to use their sacred places and have measures ready 
to effectively respond to emergencies that threaten 
and endanger them,” said Shelton.
Support from the Henry Luce Foundation will 
allow the Sacred Places Advisory Circle and 
project staff  to encourage new scholarship 
by convening Native and non-Native thought 
leaders on the topic of  sacred site protections. 
The funding will also allow the project to begin 
conducting professional development activities 
and producing outreach materials on sacred places 
protection, later in 2022 . 

Tribal Supreme 
Court Project
The Tribal Supreme Court Project is part of  the 
Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative and is staffed 
by the National Congress of  American Indians and 
the Native American Rights Fund. The Project was 
formed in 2001 in response to a series of  US Supreme 
Court cases that negatively affected tribal sovereignty. 
The purpose of  the Project is to promote greater 
coordination and to improve strategy on litigation that 
may affect the rights of  all Indian tribes. We encourage 
Indian tribes and their attorneys to contact the Project 
to coordinate resources, develop strategy and prepare 
briefs, especially at the time of  the petition for a writ of  
certiorari , prior to the Supreme Court accepting a case 
for review. You can find copies of  briefs and opinions 
on the major cases we track on the NARF website: 
https://sct.narf.org . 
Since the last update, the Court has granted two 
additional cases: Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (21-429)  
(state criminal jurisdiction in Indian country), and 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376)  (Indian Child Welfare Act). 
Castro-Huerta was argued on April 27, 2022, and we 
expect the Court to hand-down its decision before it 
departs for its summer recess. Brackeen will be argued 
sometime in the October Term 2022. We are also 
awaiting decisions in Denezpi v. United States (20-7622) 
(Double Jeopardy) and Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas (20-
493) (Indian gaming). These cases are detailed further 
below.
PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF 
CERTIORARI GRANTED
The Court has granted review in the following cases:
DENEZPI V. UNITED STATESDENEZPI V. UNITED STATES  (20-7622): 
Petitioner Merle Denezpi is a Navajo Nation citizen and 
was convicted of  a tribal law assault-and-battery charge 
by the Court of  Indian Offenses of  the Ute Mountain 
Ute Agency and served 140 days of  imprisonment. Six 
months later, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of  aggravated sexual abuse in Indian country. 
He moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it 
violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he was 
convicted of  the same offense in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses. The district court denied the motion to 
dismiss, and he was convicted after a trial. The Tenth 
Circuit affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy 
Clause was not violated because the “ultimate source” 
of  Mr. Denezpi’s prosecution in the Court of  Indian 
Offenses was the tribe’s inherent sovereignty. The 
court reasoned that Congress’s creation of  the court 
provided a forum through which the tribe could 
exercise its power of  self-governance.  
YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO V. TEXAS (20-493):  
The State of  Texas sued the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
(Pueblo), seeking to enjoin it from engaging in certain 
gaming as a violation of  Texas law. In 1987, Congress 
passed an act restoring federal recognition of  the 
Pueblo, which provided that the Pueblo may not 
conduct gaming that is prohibited under Texas law. 
Congress subsequently passed the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act (IGRA), which is more permissive of  
tribal gaming operations than the Pueblo’s restoration 
act. Texas and the Pueblo have disagreed ever since 
about whether the restoration act or IGRA control 
the Pueblo’s gaming operations. In 1993, the Fifth 
Circuit sided with Texas and held that the restoration 
act controlled. In the instant lawsuit, Texas argued 
that the Pueblo’s games violated Texas law. Relying on 
its 1993 case, the Fifth Circuit agreed and held that 
“the Restoration Act ‘govern[s] the determination of  
whether gaming activities proposed by the [ ] Pueblo 
are allowed under Texas law, which functions as 
surrogate federal law.’”
OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429)OKLAHOMA V. CASTRO-HUERTA (21-429) : 
Castro-Huerta, a non-Indian, was convicted in 
Oklahoma state court of  offenses stemming from 
the neglect of  an Indian child. His conviction was 
on appeal when the U.S. Supreme Court decided 
PAGE 8 NARF LEGAL REVIEWNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUND
McGirt v. Oklahoma , and the Oklahoma Court 
of  Criminal Appeals remanded to the trial court 
for a determination of  whether Oklahoma 
possessed jurisdiction over the crime. The trial 
court concluded that it did not because there was 
an Indian victim and the crime occurred within 
the Cherokee Nation reservation. The Oklahoma 
Court of  Criminal Appeals affirmed, and the U.S. 
Supreme Court granted review on the question of  
whether a state possesses concurrent jurisdiction 
over crimes that the United States may prosecute 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1152. Several petitions that 
raise the same or related questions are list below 
under “Petitions for a Writ of  Certiorari Pending.”
Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland Brackeen v. Haaland (21-380); Texas v. Haaland 
(21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); (21-378); Cherokee Nation v. Brackeen (21-377); 
Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):Haaland v. Brackeen (21-376):  
A Texas couple wishing to adopt an Indian child, 
and the State of  Texas, filed suit against the United 
States and several of  its agencies and officers in 
federal district court claiming that the Indian Child 
Welfare Act (ICWA) was unconstitutional. They 
were joined by additional individual plaintiffs and 
the States of  Louisiana and Indiana. Cherokee 
Nation, Oneida Nation, Quinault Indian Nation, 
and Morongo Band of  Mission Indians (collectively 
the Four Tribes) intervened as defendants, and 
Navajo Nation intervened at the appellate stage. 
The district court held that much of  ICWA was 
unconstitutional, but the Fifth Circuit, sitting en 
banc, reversed much of  that decision.  However, the 
Fifth Circuit did affirm the district court on some of  
its holdings that specific sections of  ICWA violated 
the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee 
and the Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering 
principle. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit by an equally 
divide court affirmed the district court’s holding 
that ICWA’s preference for placing Indian children 
with “other Indian families” (ICWA’s third adoptive 
preference, after family placement and placement 
with the child’s tribe) and the foster care preference 
for licensed Indian foster homes violated equal 
protection. The Fifth Circuit also concluded that the 
Tenth Amendment’s anti-commandeering  principle 
was violated by ICWA’s “active efforts,” “qualified 
expert witness,” and record keeping requirements, and an equally divided court affirmed the district 
court’s holdings that placement preferences 
and notice requirements would violate the anti-
commandeering principle if  applied to State agencies. 
Finally, the Fifth Circuit also held that certain 
provisions of  the ICWA Final Rule, specifically those 
related to the provisions that the Court had found 
to be unconstitutional, violated the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
The United States, the Four Tribes, Texas, and the 
non-Indian individuals each filed petitions for review 
at the U.S. Supreme Court. The United States and the 
Four Tribes seek review of  the Fifth Circuit’s finding 
of  unconstitutionality based on Equal Protection and 
anti-commandeering and the corresponding findings 
of  APA violations, and assert that the individual 
plaintiffs lack standing.  In its petition, Texas asserts 
that Congress acted beyond its Indian Commerce 
Clause power in enacting ICWA and that ICWA 
creates a race-based child custody system in violation 
of  the Equal Protection clause. Texas claims that 
ICWA violates the anti-commandeering principle 
and that its implementing regulations violate the 
nondelegation doctrine by allowing individual 
tribes to alter the placement preferences enacted 
by Congress. The individual plaintiffs focus their 
petition more narrowly on equal protection and
anti-commandeering claims.

independence on reservations, and protect their sovereignty. 
An adequate land base and control over natural resources 
are central components of  economic self-sufficiency and 
and self-determination, and are vital to the very existence of  
tribes. Thus, much of  NARF’s work involves protecting tribal 
natural resources. Although basic human rights are considered 
a universal and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face 
the ongoing threat of  having their rights undermined by the 
United States government, states, and others who seek to limit 
these rights. Under the priority of  promoting human rights, 
NARF strives to enforce and strengthen laws that protect 
the rights of  Native Americans to practice their traditional 
religion, use their languages, and enjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between 
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent duty 
for all levels of  government to recognize and responsibly 
enforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. 
Because such laws impact virtually every aspect of  tribal life, 
NARF is committed to holding governments accountable 
to Native Americans. Developing Indian law and educating 
the public about Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential 
for the continued protection of  Indian rights. This primarily 
involves establishing favorable court precedents, distributing 
information and law materials, encouraging and fostering 
Indian legal education, and forming alliances with Indian law 
practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to NARF’s 
main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302. NARF’s 
clients are expected to pay what they can toward the costs of  
legal representation.The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) is the oldest and 
largest nonprofit legal organization defending and promoting 
the legal rights of  Indian people on issues essential to their 
tribal sovereignty, natural resources, and human rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided specialized legal advice and 
representation to Native American tribes and organizations on 
issues of  major importance. Our early work was instrumental 
in establishing the field of  Indian law. NARF—when very few 
would—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious freedom 
and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, as 
well as basic human and civil rights. We continue to take on 
complex, time-consuming cases that others avoid, such as 
government accountability, voting rights, climate change, and 
the education of  our children. We have assisted more than 300 
tribal nations with critical issues that go to the heart of  who 
we are as sovereign nations.
NARF’s first Board of  Directors developed priorities to 
guide the organization in its mission to preserve and enforce 
the legal rights of  Native Americans. Those five priorities 
continue to lead NARF today:
• Preserve tribal existence
• Protect tribal natural resources
• Promote Native American human rights
• Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
• Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian 
rights, laws, and issues
Under preserving tribal existence, NARF works to construct 
the foundations that empower tribes to live according 
to their traditions, enforce their treaty rights, insure their The Native American Rights Fund
