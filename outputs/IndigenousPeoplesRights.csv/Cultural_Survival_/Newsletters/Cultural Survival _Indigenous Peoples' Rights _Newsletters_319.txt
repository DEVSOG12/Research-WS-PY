If we want change, we must provide leadership support for youth in making change possible. Indigenous youth in particular continue to face racism and discrimination and are marginalized in society, but when they have a sense of belonging and a strong cultural identity they become resilient, powerful individuals. They have immersed roots through their ancestral lineage, wisdom, and intelligence. They are the future leaders for their communities.On Air: Cultural Survival Indigenous Community Media Youth FellowsYouth are the future of Indigenous communities, and strengthening youth leadership is essential in fostering the next generation of Indigenous leaders.
