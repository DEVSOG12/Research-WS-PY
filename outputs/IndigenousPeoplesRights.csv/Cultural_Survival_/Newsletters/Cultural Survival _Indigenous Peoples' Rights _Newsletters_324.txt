Exploiting the relative isolation of these islands and these ocean people, the US managed the environment and health consequences of their militarism through “out of sight, out of mind” and “the solution to pollution is dilution” policies. These strategies worked in the short term for those living in distant corridors of power.Advocating for Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights at the UN: COPINH Participates in Honduras’ State ReviewIndigenous communities are increasingly utilizing international human right mechanisms to advocate for their rights.

However, since transnational companies began buying land across the peninsula in the 1980s, principally for coal extraction, the landscape has become increasingly bleak. The water is now murky and polluted; drought and deforestation have caused the once fruitful lands to become arid and barren.Environmental Disaster and Resilience: The Marshall Islands ExperienceBetween 1946 and 1958, the United States detonated 67 nuclear bombs in their Pacific Proving Grounds on, in, and above Bikini and Enewetak Atolls in the Marshall Islands, a part of the United Nations Pacific Trust Territories. Hydrogen bombs, especially the March 1, 1954 Bravo test, were immensely destructive. Visible from 250 miles with a mushroom cloud stretching 60 miles across, Bravo vaporized several small islands, left a mile-wide crater on the atoll, and generated heavy radioactive fallout across a 50,000 square mile area.Hear Our Voices: Launching a Communications Caucus at the UNOral tradition for Indigenous Peoples has long been a mechanism to share ancestral knowledge.
