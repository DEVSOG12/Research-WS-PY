Member states of the United Nations and indigenous peoples’ representatives from around the world, including representatives of several Indian and Alaska Native nations, are invited to offer their views and respond to questions regarding the need for a new status for indigenous governing institutions at the UN, how they should be accredited, and what substantive rights of participation they should have.Additional consultations in 2017 are scheduled for January 30-February 1, February 27-28, and April 24-May 5 (with specific dates to be determined at a later date). The UN General Assembly is expected to make a decision on the matter before the end of its current session in September, 2017.Video Testimony - April 26, 2017Karla General, Indian Law Resource Center StatementILRC Statement on participationVideo Testimony - Feb. 28, 2017Karla General, Indian Law Resource Center  - Participation ModalitiesChris Foley, Indian Law Resource Center - Selection CriteriaKarla General, Indian Law Resource Center - Selection BodyStatementsILRC statement re accreditation standards.pdfILRC statement re venue.pdf ILRC statement re selection mechanism.pdfILRC statement re modalities.pdfVideo Testimony - January 31AM Session - Venues of ParticipationKarla General, Indian Law Resource CenterWill Micklin, 2nd Vice President, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of AlaskaAM Session - Modalities of ParticipationKarla General, Indian Law Resource CenterWill Micklin, 2nd Vice President, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of AlaskaPM Session - Selection MechanismLynn Malerba, Lifetime Chief, Mohegan TribeWill Micklin, 2nd Vice President, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of AlaskaPM Session - Selection CriteriaKarla General, Indian Law Resource CenterStatementsDownload ILRC statement re accreditation standardsDownload ILRC statement re modalitiesDownload ILRC statement re selection mechanism Download ILRC statement re venueVideo Testimony Day 1- Dec. 14, 2016AM Session- Venues of ParticipationWill Micklin, 2nd Vice President, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska Chris Foley, Indian Law Resource CenterPM Session - Participation ModalitiesTerri Henry, Secretary of State, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Karla General, Indian Law Resource CenterVideo Testimony Day 2 - Dec. 15, 2016AM Session - Recognition/Selection MechanismWill Micklin, 2nd Vice President, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska - AccreditationChris Foley, Indian Law Resource CenterPM Session - Selection CriteriaWill Micklin, 2nd Vice President, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska - Identification Karla General, Indian Law Resource CenterTerri Henry, Secretary of State, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians StatementsDownload ILRC statement re accreditation standards.pdf Download ILRC statement re modalities.pdf Download ILRC final statement re recognition selection mechanism.pdf Download ILRC statement re venue.pdfSiteWorking to protect the legal rights, cultures and environments of Indian nations and other indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1978.About UsWe are a non-proﬁt law and advocacy organization.ContinueSubscribeSubscribe to Indigenous Notes for the latest news from the Center.Email:Take ActionHelp Support and Protect Indigenous Rights.ContinueAboutBoard of DirectorsStaffEmploymentInternshipsAnnual ReportsFinancial InformationContact UsIssuesEnding Violence Against Native WomenEnvironmental ProtectionHUMAN RIGHTSLAND RIGHTSLaw ReformNATIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF-GOVERNANCEPROTECTING SACRED SITESProjectsLAW REFORMMultilateral Development BanksThe American Declaration on The Rights of Indigenous PeoplesWorld Conference on Indigenous PeoplesContact UsMain Office602 North Ewing StreetHelena, MT 59601406.449.2006mt@indianlaw.orgD.C.
