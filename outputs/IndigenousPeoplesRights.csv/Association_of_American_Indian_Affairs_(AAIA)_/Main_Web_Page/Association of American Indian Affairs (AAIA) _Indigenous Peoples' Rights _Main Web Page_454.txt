The Association was formed in 1922 to change the destructive path of federal policy from assimilation, termination and allotment, to sovereignty, ​self-determination and self-sufficiency. Throughout our 100-year history, we have provided national advocacy on watershed issues that support sovereignty and culture, while working at a grassroots level with Tribes to support the implementation of programs that affect real lives on the ground.Currently, the Association is engaged in a comprehensive strategic planning process to prepare the organization for its next 100 years. By building internal capacity and efficient infrastructure around our cultural values, the Association will achieve its vision to ensure “A world where Native American cultures and values are lived, protected and respected.”But one thing is very clear. We cannot continue into the next 100 years without you. We need your commitment, we need your time, we need your  advocacy, and most important, we need your financial support to continue the great path that the Association has laid down over the last 100 years. Now is the time to commit to the next 100 years of American Indian sovereignty, culture, education and capacity building.The Association offers opportunities for your commitment at every level.  Your support will fund programs that protect sovereignty, preserve culture, educate youth and build capacity. Commit to our 100 Months in 100 Years Campaign!
