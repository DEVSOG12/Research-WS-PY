We seek to improve the lives of people who perform sexual labor by choice, circumstance, or coercion, people profiled as such, and communities impacted by the criminalization of sex work and sexual exchange.Decriminalize. Decarcerate. Destigmatize.Decriminalize sex trade related offenses in New York that harm people who do sexual labor by choice, circumstance, or coercion, including sex workers and people profiled as sex workers, as well as people who purchase sexual services. Pass legislation and implement administrative policies that protect people in the sex trades from economic exploitation as well as interpersonal violence.Decarcerate people who have been arrested on sex trade-related offenses so that people can move forward with their lives without lingering ties to the criminal legal system. Vacate criminal records related to prostitution and end the ongoing entanglement with the court system that the rescue industry produces.Destigmatize the sex trade so that workers have access to housing, education, employment, health care, and other basic needs without restriction. Not everyone trading sex wants to continue doing so and we support evidence-based, harm reduction-rooted policies and funding that supports people’s safety and empowers those seeking different work.Interested in becoming a coalition member, doing press about our work, or have other questions?
