Promoting the Rights, Voices, and Visions of Indigenous PeoplesCultural     SurvivalANNUALREPORT2006fter 24 years of negotiation, the United Nations’ new Human Rights Council
finally adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in June.
One last hurdle remains: its adoption by the United Nations General Assembly. 
Why, you may wonder, is it taking so long for the United Nations to recognize the
rights of the world’s 370 million indigenous peoples? If anyone on this planet needsinternational protection for their human rights, it is the indigenous. Called Indians,First Peoples, Aborigines, Eskimos, or the names they call themselves—Wampanoag,Pokomam, Batwa, or MakMak—indigenous peoples are among the poorest and mostmarginalized peoples on our planet today. 
Despite objections by a handful of states—most notably the United States, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand—the Human Rights Council adopted the Declaration bya wide margin and forwarded it to the General Assembly. Ordinarily, GeneralAssembly approval should have been a matter of course. Instead, backroom lobbyingby the powerful objecting states has stalled it again. What they don’t like is the lan-guage in the Declaration that gives indigenous peoples rights to their lands andresources, and ensures their free, prior, and informed consent before those rights areimpeded upon. It is now uncertain when the General Assembly will adopt it.
More than any other initiative, our campaign for the Declaration embodies the heart
of Cultural Survival. We have empowered, supported, and partnered with indigenouspeoples for 34 years, doing whatever it takes to ensure that indigenous lands andresources are protected, their human rights are respected, and their voices are heard.Sometimes it feels as if we are moving mountains. Sometimes it feels as if somebodyis digging mountains out from under indigenous communities. Either way, we standside by side with our indigenous partners and insist that their rights be recognizedand respected.
This is no easy task in a world in which indigenous peoples must compete for global
attention with wars in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, climate change, and otherurgent problems. In our fear, it is easy to blame the “other” or see the world in “usversus them” terms. Yet indigenous peoples teach us that there are multiple, equallyvaluable ways to be human. They open our eyes to the richness of human diversityand the essential values of mutual respect, tolerance, and understanding.
At the same time, they remind us of the destruction we wreak when we do not live
by these values. The other night I watched the film

www.cs.org CULTURAL SURVIVALMessage From The Executive Director
AWalter Hill’s dramatic rendition of the final days of this wise warrior’s battle against the American genocide of his
Chiricahua Apache. My mind flashed to Darfur, Sudan’s contemporary equivalent. The scorched-earth tactics ofSudanese troops and ethnic Arab militias against hundreds of thousands of Fur, Masalit, Zaghawa, and otherAfrican villagers reminded me painfully of the assaults by the U.S. Army and cowboy posses against native peoplesin the American West. 
No amount of economic development can create a better world if we refuse to learn from the past. Indigenous peo-
ples teach us that we must look backward as well as forward; that we are one with our ancestors and our progeny;and that being human requires us to repair the harms of the past and respect the people and the earth’s resourcesthat will nurture the future.
The Declaration guarantees that indigenous peoples—as individuals as well as groups—will not be subjected to
genocide, ethnocide, or assimilation; forcible removal from their lands; or the crossfire of others’ armed conflicts.It guarantees their rights to govern themselves and to determine their own futures, to manifest their cultures, speaktheir languages, and practice their spiritual traditions and teach them to their children. It ensures their rights totheir lands, territories, and resources and imposes on states the duty to obtain their free, prior, and informed con-sent before approving any development plan or resource-use project that would affect them. 
Cultural Survival works to make the protections promised in the Declaration a reality. Our partners include small,
marginalized communities, such as the Dukha nomadic reindeer herders in Mongolia. They also include largeorganizations, such as our Guatemala Radio partners, whose work reaches hundreds of indigenous communities.In some cases we facilitate dialogue between indigenous peoples and non-indigenous entities whose intereststhreaten them.
Our freshly designed, full-color news magazine, the 
Cultural Survival Quarterly , analyzes cutting edge indigenous
issues, while our website reports breaking news and tells our readers how to respond to urgent situations. Weincreased our public education and outreach by hosting a dozen bazaars in New England and Washington, D.C.,and hosted a troupe of Mayan women playwrights and actors who toured U.S. college campuses to raise moneyfor their indigenous women’s rights programs back home. 
All this was and more was accomplished with a 10-person staff working closely with our predominantly indige-
nous Program Council and supported by our Board of Directors and by many dedicated donors, members, interns,and volunteers.
While the challenges ahead are many—including persuading the UN General Assembly to adopt the Human Rights
Council’s text of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples—Cultural Survival is forging ahead with itsefforts to promote the rights, voices, and visions of the world’s indigenous peoples. 
ANNUAL REPORT 20063TibetProjectAccomplishments
The Chungba Primary Boarding School in Sichuan educates over 250 boys and girls aged 7–13 in the remote
Chungba Valley. Before the school was founded, few Chungba residents were literate. In its second year,Chungba Valley’s students placed first among the province’s 52 schools. In 2006, the Tibet Project funded theconstruction of the Chungba Middle School.
The Rebkong Cultural Center houses a growing library of Tibetan literature and audio-visual materials in
Tibetan, Chinese, and English, and a computer center linking scholars to resources inside the country andaround the globe. The center’s Women’s Education Program supports low-income women attending univer-sity and low-income girls attending high school. The center teaches adults English, Chinese, and Tibetan. 
The Adult Women’s School empowers women by providing Chinese and Tibetan literacy education to women
who have left abusive situations to live in a Buddhist nunnery.
The Taksham Reforestation Project established a tree and plant nursery tended by monks in the Taksham
Monastery, and it reforested hillsides that had been stripped by logging. The hillsides have been replanted withlocal varieties of pine and sandalwood. To diversify farmers’ crops, the nursery also provides them with fruitand nut trees and traditional Tibetan medicinal plants. A total of 400,000 trees have been planted.CULTURAL SURVIVAL SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES MACHIK
Cultural Survival launched the Tibet Projectin the 1990s with the intent that it wouldgrow to be an independent, self-supportingnongovernmental organization. This year,that goal was achieved: The new organization,Machik, which is run by Tibetans for Tibetans,continues the work begun by CulturalSurvival’s Tibet Project.

•Students at the Ruth Walter Chungba Primary School5ANNUAL REPORT 2006The Guatemala Community Radio Project is predi-
cated on a bold idea: Indigenous peoples don’thave to be assimilated in order to better their situa-tion, they can retain their culture 
andfully partici-
pate in the nation state.
Despite constituting a majority of the population
of Guatemala, indigenous peoples have very littlerepresentation and voice in the government;indeed, for 30 years the government waged waragainst them. Now that the war has ended anddemocracy is taking hold, indigenous peoples needa way to participate in government without sacri-ficing their own distinct cultures.
Community radio serves that goal. Local stations
promote indigenous music, language, and culture,and provide indigenous peoples with informationabout their rights and obligations in their own lan-guages. Cultural Survival is working with a consor-tium of 250 radio stations in Guatemala. We helpthem become financially self-sufficient, improveand share their broadcast content, and providetechnical expertise. 
ProjectAccomplishmentsin2006
Cultural Survival launched the Guatemala Radio Project by signing a memorandum of understanding with
the Consejo Guatemalteco de Comunicación Comunitaria and its five affiliates, which represent the coun-try’s 250 community radio stations.
Cultural Survival invited community radio leaders to travel to Washington and Boston to meet with allies
able to assist them in protecting Guatemala’s community radio movement, including the Inter-AmericanCommission on Human Rights, members of Congress, and the U.S. Department of State. Our guests alsoappeared on U.S. radio programs including the Voice of America—the first international media attention forthe Guatemalan community radio movement.
The Guatemala Radio Project broadcast its first professionally produced radio soap opera, which dramatize in
Spanish and in indigenous languages the ways indigenous peoples can ensure that their rights are protected.To hear the Spanish version of some of these productions go to Cultural Survival’s website: www.cs.org/programs/radio.cfmPROMOTING INDIGENOUS PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRACY IN GUATEMALA
“Before we started the radio station in PalinEscuintla eight years ago, our language,Pocomam, was only spoken in our homes. NowPocomam is spoken everywhere—in offices, inthe streets, even by our children, who are learn-ing it from their parents. Without communityradio, we might have lost our native tongue.”

•The Dukha, Soyot, Evenk, and Tofa nomadic reindeer herders of the Sayan Mountains of southern Siberia
and northern Mongolia are among the smallest and poorest indigenous communities in Asia. Yet they arerich in heritage and commitment to preserving their cultures. Cultural Survival’s Totem Peoples Projecthelps these herders gain access to and represent themselves before their governments so that they canremain economically self-sufficient, educate their children in their own languages, and preserve their uniqueways of life in a fragile environment.
ProjectAccomplishmentsin2006
Cultural Survival arranged for Dukha representatives to meet with officials of the Mongolian ministries of
Health, Education, and Agriculture in December 2005 and July 2006 to advocate for their health care, educa-tional, and veterinary needs. These meetings resulted in an agreement to increase educational support and tobuild a health care facility in their region.
The Totem Project’s veterinary specialist, Nansalmaa Myagmar, provided veterinary assistance to Dukha
herders in the East and West Taiga.
Dukha teacher Ms. Oyambaadam held the first-ever native language school program for Dukha children as
they traveled with their families across their summer ranges.
A Cultural Survival delegation traveled to Russia and Mongolia in July to conduct a human rights assessment
of the Totem peoples. They met with herder leaders, activists, journalists, and government officials in bothcountries.PROGRAMS (CONTINUED )

••Dukha reindeer herders in Mongolia7ANNUAL REPORT 2006LobbyingforIndigenousRights:
Cultural Survival joined dozens of indigenous rights and human rights advocates in lobbying for passage of the
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Cultural Survival was present in Geneva, Switzerland, atthe first session on the United Nations’ Human Rights Council, where the Declaration was adopted andforwarded to the United Nations General Assembly, and we are continuing to lobby for the Declaration during
the current session of the General Assembly.
ExpandingOptionsforIndigenousRightsProtection:
In October 2005, Cultural Survival co-hosted a conference at the University of Arizona that contrasted the legal
reforms to protect indigenous peoples’ rights in countries throughout the Americas with the problemsindigenous peoples in those countries face. As expected, the conference revealed a wide gap between law andreality. But it also brought to light many creative strategies that indigenous peoples are using to persuadegovernments to be more proactive in protecting their rights. The proceedings from the seminar were publishedin the 
Cultural Survival Quarterly and incorporated into the annual report of the United Nations Special
Rapporteur on the Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples.
OTHER CULTURAL SURVIVAL ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Petrona de la Cruz Cruz, co-founder of La FOMMA ( La Fortaleza de la Mujer Maya or Strength
of the Mayan Woman), shares a moment of joy at a Cultural Survival program featuring theirplay, Just with the Love of My Mother . See also page 19.8CULTURAL SURVIVALFacilitatingDialogueBetweenIndigenous
andNon-IndigenousPeoples:
In June, Cultural Survival hosted a dialogue in
which the National Geographic Society’sGenographics Project, the Indigenous PeoplesCouncil on Biocolonialism, and CulturalSurvival’s Program Council participated. TheGenographics Project seeks to use indigenouspeoples’ DNA to map humankind’s 60,000-yearmigratory history and demonstrate humanity’sinterconnectedness. Indigenous peoples areconcerned about the project’s consent processand the security procedures in place to protect theDNA samples. They point out that the projectdoes not benefit indigenous peoples and thatindigenous peoples were not involved in itsdesign or implementation. They fear thatgovernments or others will misuse the project’sfindings to scientifically undermine theirindigenousness or their rights to their lands andterritories. Cultural Survival tried to convinceNational Geographic to understand and addressindigenous peoples’ concerns; when those effortsfailed, we called for suspension of theGenographic Project.
BuildinganEducation:
After years of exile in Pakistan, Ersari Turkmen
families have returned to their homelands inAfghanistan. Cultural Survival’s Ersari Project isbuilding a school in Aqcha, Afghanistan toprovide education for 250 girls and boys living inthe province. Construction is set to be completedin the spring of 2007.
Débora Barros Fince, a Wayuu indigenous woman from la Guajira,Colombia, visited Cultural Survival’s office to speak about thatmassacre that devastated her community in 2004.ANNUAL REPORT 20069Our news magazine, the Cultural Survival Quarterly , is on the cutting edge of the issues indigenous peoples face.
For example:
FairTradeandIndigenousPeoplesidentified ways that well-motivated fair traders can better serve
indigenous peoples, as well as ways that indigenous peoples can enhance the benefits of fair trade forthemselves. The issue was distributed worldwide to all the major fair trade associations, as well as toU.S. companies that are marketing fair trade coffee or crafts. Fair trade also was the focus of an issue of
Voices , our newspaper for indigenous peoples, which was distributed in Spanish to every fair trade
coffee and craft cooperative in Guatemala.
WaterRightsandIndigenousPeopleshighlighted the water rights violations that indigenous peoples
face, and the ways that indigenous peoples are using their water management traditions to protect thislife-sustaining resource. CS distributed copies of the issue to the delegates at this year’s World WaterForum in Mexico City and, while there, strengthened ties with indigenous leaders who are working onthis issue.
BridgingtheGapBetweenLawandRealityhighlighted the steps that indigenous peoples and their
governments can take to bridge the gap between the good laws on many countries’ books andindigenous peoples’ daily reality. The issue presented the findings from an international conferencethat Cultural Survival helped to organize with the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights andFundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples and the University of Arizona’s Indigenous Peoples Law& Policy Program. 
AfricanIndigeneityfocused on hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and other small, remote groups in Africa
who face extreme threats to their lands, lifestyles, and cultures because of globalization, developmentpolicies, and discrimination by more politically dominant groups. We sent the issue to Africangovernment officials and to the African Union to help them understand the importance of protectingthese native peoples, their cultures, and their means of subsistence.
This year, the 
Cultural Survival Quarterly went to a full-color format, with improvements in both the quantity
and quality of photographs and a more dynamic layout. The articles now share similarities to those in amainstream magazine while retaining the depth and authority for which the 
Cultural Survival Quarterly has
always been known. Our appeal to a wider audience has paid off with increased newsstand sales and librarysubscriptions, as well as increased memberships, which, in turn, broaden the base of support for CulturalSurvival’s work. 
Cultural Survival continued to produce its newspaper 
Voices in English, Spanish, French, and Russian and
distributed these to over 500 indigenous rights organizations worldwide. In addition, we gave our website a facelift.Our
Weekly Indigenous News became the World Indigenous News . It now includes original reporting, breaking
news stories, and urgent action appeals, all of which are sent to subscribers and posted on the web as they occur.PUBLICATIONS AND WEBSITE
10CULTURAL SURVIVALCultural Survival expanded its Bazaars Program from two events in 2005 to 12 events in 2006. Winter
Bazaars were held in Cambridge, MA, Boston, MA, Northampton, MA, and Providence, RI, and at theAmerican Anthropological Association’s annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Summer Bazaars wereheld in Amherst, Plymouth, Eastham, and Lenox, MA; Tiverton, RI; Burlington, VT; and Portland, ME.The Summer Bazaars not only brought in income and new members, but also generated publicity.Television crews covered the bazaars for local stations, and radio stations promoted the events—andCultural Survival—through public service announcements. Through feature stories in 35 newspapers,we reached an audience of over 2.1 million.MEMBERSHIP
BAZAARSCultural Survival’s members continued to be the organization’s greatest source of support, providing62 percent of our annual income. This year, 824 new members joined Cultural Survival; 611 of themsigned up at bazaars. Over three-fourths of our high and major donors first joined as basic members.

—Blessing Tawengwa, 
Cultural Survival intern, spring 2006
Cultural Survival hosted 32 interns and two volunteers this
year. They were involved in every aspect of our work: 
Guatemala Radio Project: Interns helped to organize logistics and provide translation for three repre-
sentatives of our Guatemala Radio partners during their visit to the United States. They made a digitalmap of the community radio network and helped evaluate the first radio soap opera series.
Bazaars: Interns contributed to the success of our expanded bazaars program. Tasks included setting
up and breaking down the bazaar tent, maintaining security, encouraging attendees to join CulturalSurvival, assisting vendors and performers, selling rugs and crafts, handing out flyers, and directingtraffic.
Publications and Research: Interns wrote or contributed to articles that were published in the 
Cultural
Survival Quarterly and wrote features and urgent appeals for the World Indigenous News . They also
improved our distribution of Voices by conducting a worldwide survey of indigenous rights organiza-
tions.
Events: Interns coordinated, transported, and translated for the Mayan theater troupe La FOMMA at
13 schools and universities in New England. In addition, interns organized a fall film series with theWestern Hemisphere Project at MIT, where four films on indigenous rights were aired and discussed. 
“During my internship at Cultural Survival, I learned how a nonprofit organization is run, gained expand-
ed research and organizational skills, and had a successful sales experience as part of the summerbazaars program. These experiences will make me a more valuable employee when I join the job mar-ket next year.”

In March, Cultural Survival broughtLa FOMMA to New England colleges and uni-versities to present the same plays they per-form in Chiapas. They raised $10,000 fromspeaking fees and craft sales, which they usedto fund their programs in bilingual literacy,job skills training, health education, childcare, and women’s health. 
Most visitors to the hotels of San Cristobal de las Casas will never meet the indigenous women who
leave their villages to work as cooks, hotel workers, and maids. Tourists who peer in awe at the mon-umental ruins of the ancient Maya in Palenque will never see the poverty and violence of modernMayan women’s lives. Cultural Survival bridges that divide. For 35 years, we have promoted therights, voices, and visions of indigenous peoples through our publications and programs. Even moreimportant, we work with partners like La FOMMA to teach the world about the rights of indigenouspeoples, while helping to ensure that their rights and their cultures are protected.INDIGENOUS RIGHTS IN ACTION
