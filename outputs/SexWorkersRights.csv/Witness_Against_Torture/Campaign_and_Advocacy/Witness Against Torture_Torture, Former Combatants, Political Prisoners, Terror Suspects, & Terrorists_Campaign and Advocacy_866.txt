To commemorate this important day, we held a vigil at the White House and read the names of the Muslims who have been tortured and remain imprisoned at Guantanamo.Every year since our founding in 2005, we have consistently drawn attention to abuses at Guantanamo, while uplifting the names and stories of the Muslim men who have been housed or continue to be housed there in the "War on Terror."  This is important because even when Guantanamo Bay is part of the discourse in the US, there is never been any acknowledgment of the humanity of the men detained.  They're used as a means to our national security ends.That's why we have continued to strengthen our resolve.  No matter what the US government does or doesn't do in regard to Guantanamo, Witness Against Torture will remain steadfast in our mission to end torture and close Guantanamo Bay once and for all.As we continue this journey with all of you, our community, thank you for all your support in our years of organizing.  This work is an uphill battle and that's why we're asking for your help to sustain our organizing by helping us raise $5,000 in the next 30 days.If you have the resources, please consider donating $10, $25, $50, $100 or more to support the work of Witness Against Torture.  With your generosity and our resistance combined, we will make torture a remnant of the past.In solidarity,Witness Against TortureJoin us on June 29th for our co-sponsored event "Democratizing Torture:  Systematic Punishment in the United States and IsraelJoin Witness Against Torture and Justice for Muslims Collective on Tuesday, June 29th at 2 PM EST for the "Democratizing Torture: Systemic Punishment in the United States and Israel" panel in commemoration with June as torture awareness month.  More information can be found here and you can rsvp here.Donate to support our workPlease consider a donation to help fund our annual Fast for Justice this January.  We are completely volunteer driven and run.

They began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, end indefinite detention and torture and call out Islamophobia. During our demonstrations, we lift up the words of the detainees themselves, bringing them to public spaces they are not permitted to access. Witness Against Torture will carry on in its activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.www.witnessagainsttorture.comCopyright © 2021 Witness Against Torture, All rights reserved.Want to change how you receive these emails?You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.
