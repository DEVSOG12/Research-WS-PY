Once we returned from that journey, we began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, working with interfaith, human rights and activist organizations.As we approach our ten year anniversary, we are still here at the forefront of the struggle to close Guantanamo and end torture everywhere. Our most recent celebration was Shaker Aamer’s release to his family and home in the UK. He sent his supporters a message included below – please read it! It’s for you too. You helped get him home.And the work continues. There are 112 men left indefinitely detained at Guantanamo Bay Prison. They need to be released, not moved to a new prison. There is also a man – Younous Chekkouri, who was released from Guantanamo in September only to be detained by his own government in Morocco. His wife wrote a heartwrenching appeal here and our partners at Reprieve are encouraging folks to write to John Kerry here.President Obama’s last year in office is approaching and we have decided to put together a video, explaining our mission and work, and launch a fundraiser to raise $8,000 by December 15. We need your help to make this effort successful.Please click on the image above or click here to donate : https://www.razoo.com/story/Witness-Against-TorturePlease share the fundraiser page and Witness Against Torture’s mission with your family and friends via email, facebook, twitter and all other forms of communication.With your support, we will carry on in our activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to accountJanuary Fast for Justice: January 3rd to the 13th, 2016:Please also consider joining us in D.C. this January to continue our witness.
