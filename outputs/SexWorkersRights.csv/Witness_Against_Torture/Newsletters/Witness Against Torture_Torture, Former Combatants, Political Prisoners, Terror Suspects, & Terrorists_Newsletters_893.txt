The CIA lied. Will there be accountability?The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on the CIA’s interrogation and detention program was released on Tuesday. The findings are horrifying. Detainees were forced to stand on broken limbs, deprived of sleep for up to 180 hours, and subject to “rectal feeding.” There were mock executions and threats to kill and rape family members. One man froze to death and another was shackled to walls and literally forgotten about.The report concludes that this torture did not stop a single terrorist attack and that the CIA lied to congress, the news media, and even the White House about the techniques used in the interrogations and the “efficacy” of the program. Finally, the report focuses only on a narrow slice of the US’s brutal, global counter-terrorism program, which tortured far more people than the detained men profiled in the study.Despite the clear commission of crimes by the CIA, its contractors, and the high-level officials — including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld — who designed or authorized the program, the Obama administration continues to refuse to hold anyone accountable for state torture.Click here to take action by signing this letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder urging him to prosecute high-level government officials who authorized, justified, and covered up these monstrous crimes.To read more news on the report click below:The GuardianThe Washington PostThe whole 500 page Executive SummarySix men released from Guantánamo: 136 RemainWe are excited to announce that there were six men released to Uruguay last weekend.
