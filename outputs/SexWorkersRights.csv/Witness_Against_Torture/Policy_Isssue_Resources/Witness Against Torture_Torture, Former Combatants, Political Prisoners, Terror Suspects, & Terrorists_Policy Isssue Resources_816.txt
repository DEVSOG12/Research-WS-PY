Prisoners - Witness Against TortureActionNewsPhotosVideosEventsPrisonersResourcesAboutStore5Frida with Guantánamo Detainee PhotosTortured, Indefinitely Detained PrisonersAre These Men Your Enemies?Witness Against Torture focuses on telling the stories of the men detained at Guantanamo Bay Prison, who have been ripped from their homes, detained for years in abusive conditions and tortured by the United States. They have not been convicted of any crime. In fact, Adnan had been cleared for release from Guantánamo. We think that once you know the stories of Shaker Aamer, Samir Mukbel and Tariq Ba Odah, who were recently released, Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif, who died there, and Mohamedou Ould Slahi and Ravil Mingazov, who is still detained there, you will be fighting for human rights and justice too. Members of Witness Against Torture, a grassroots nonviolent activist group dedicated to ending torture and detention at Guantánamo, Bagram and anywhere else it is being carried out by our government, are available to come to your school, place of worship or community group, to share the story of these men.Read a StorySamir MoqbelRavil MingazovMohamedou Ould SlahiTariq ba OdahAdnan LatifShaker AamerIn FocusSamir MoqbelTariq ba OdahAdnan LatifShaker AamerIn Their Own Words: WAT Reads Detainee LettersWhy Trump Should Close GuantánamoMohammed al-Hamiri: In His Own WordsTariq ba Odah: In His Own WordsWAT Members Talk About Detainees at Guantánamo BayAren’t All the Men in Guantánamo Terrorists?Jerica Arents: Why I’m at GuantánamoMark Colville: Why I’m at GuantánamoJoin us on social mediaJoin UsNewsPhotosVideosEventsPrisonersResourcesAboutStoreFacebook
