The study, which examined data related to perpetrators and victims in Ohio’s 53 current-era executions, found that the race and gender of the victim significantly influences which murderers receive capital punishment and which receive an alternative sentence.“Whether they support the death penalty or not, Ohioans want our criminal justice system to treat everyone equally, regardless of where they live or the color of their skin,” said Kevin Werner, Executive Director of Ohioans to Stop Executions. “This new study looks only at 53 cases resulting in an execution, and the findings reveal troubling racial, gender and geographic disparities. I think if we take a look at all potentially capital cases – cases where a death sentence was overturned, or where prosecutors sought a death sentence but the jury chose life – the numbers would reveal even greater disparities.”Kevin Werner may be reached for further comment at 614-560-0654 or kwerner@otse.orgThe full report is here.To speak with the author of the report, please call 510-393-4549 or email sfaucher@8thamendment.orgFiled Under: News Copyright © 2022 · undesign on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in
