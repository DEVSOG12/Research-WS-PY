OTSE board memberAll Sides With Ann Fisher’s segment this morning on Ohio’s death penalty is the perfect opportunity to introduce one of OTSE’s new board members, Jonathan Mann. Jonathan called into Ann Fisher’s show this morning to share his story.From our Board & Staff Page: https://otse.org/board-staff/After Thomas Knuff was arrested and charged for his father’s murder in 2017, Jonathan was at a moral crossroads. As he began to learn more about the death penalty, he realized it wasn’t as simple, efficient or cost-effective as he believed. He struggled with acceptance of what he began to understand while letting go of pain and anger. Uncertain of how to heal and move forward, he recognized an execution wouldn’t be the answer to either. By asking for mercy for Thomas, Jonathan found a way to honor his Father and a path to mend. He hopes to help stop capital punishment by speaking about his experiences as a family member of a victim. Jonathan published an op-ed in The Columbus Dispatch earlier this year that talks more in depth about victims’ issues and the death penalty.In addition to serving on OTSE’s board, Jonathan is a System Administrator at Deluxe Corporation.Listen here.Filed Under: News Copyright © 2022 · undesign on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in
