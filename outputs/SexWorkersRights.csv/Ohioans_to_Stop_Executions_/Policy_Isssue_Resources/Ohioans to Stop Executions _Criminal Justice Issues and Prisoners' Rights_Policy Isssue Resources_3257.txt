Terry stood up and advocated for the things he believed in, especially in his work to end the death penalty. We are a better organization for having known him and seeing him lead by example. We will miss his friendship, quick wit and his uncanny ability to make the most complex things simple. Our thoughts and prayers are with Linda and the entire family.Terry Collins never missed an opportunity to share his perspectives on the death penalty, and he was one of the most sought-after “Voices of Experience” on the OTSE team. A high quality video (18 minutes) of his typical presentation is here.Terry was to have been the keynote speaker at OTSE’s upcoming Death Penalty Lobby Day at the Ohio Statehouse on April 12th. Plans for an appropriate tribute to Terry and his leadership are under way and will be announced in the coming weeks.Terry published his most recent op-ed about the death penalty, “The Death Penalty Isn’t Worth Fixing,” at the invitation of WCPO in Cincinnati on February 24th. In that he referenced his association with the newly established national project, Public Safety Officials on the Death Penalty.OTSE staff member Abraham Bonowitz worked very closely with Terry over the past several years.
