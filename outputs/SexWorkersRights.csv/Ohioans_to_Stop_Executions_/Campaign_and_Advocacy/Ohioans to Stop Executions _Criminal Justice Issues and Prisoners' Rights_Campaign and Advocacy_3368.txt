The photo documents the many locations executioners attempted to insert the intravenous needle through which lethal doses of drugs would have been injected.“I give blood regularly, and there’s always that moment of worry before they insert the needle,” said Groner. “I can only imagine what it must have been like to lay there for two hours getting poked over and over. Anyone who looks at that photo knows that we put that man through a significant ordeal. I don’t think he should have to go through it a second time.”“The real torture of the death penalty is the wait,” said Abraham Bonowitz, Communications Director for the statewide group. “We know from those who have received last-minute stays that those final few days and hours are incredibly stressful. Romell Broom has suffered the mental torture of execution already, and he will suffer plenty more with a commutation to life without parole. That’s why we call on Governor Kasich to do exactly that. Today. In granting clemency Governor Kasich will turn off the spotlight on the offender, prevent a re-traumatization of the execution team, and allow the victims family to put this behind them and begin to heal.”The petition is here: http://action.otse.org/page/s/clemency-for-romell-broomDr. Groner is available for interviews.Filed Under: News Copyright © 2022 · undesign on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in
