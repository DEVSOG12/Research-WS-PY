With the signing of two secretarial orders, Haaland (1) created the Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force, which will engage in tribal consultation and consider public feedback on proposed name changes; and (2) declared “squaw” to be a derogatory term that will no longer be used in naming federal lands. Currently, there are more than 600 federal land units that include this slur in the name. Secretary Haaland instructed the Board on Geographic Names to remove the term from federal use.

NARF Executive Director John Echohawk responded to the action, “Names that still use derogatory terms are an embarrassing legacy of this country’s colonialist and racist past. It is well-past time for us, as a nation, to move forward, beyond these derogatory terms, and show Native people—and all people—equal respect. We applaud Secretary Halaand for taking action to make our federal government and public lands more inclusive and respectful of Native peoples.”More blog postsShareShare on FacebookTweetSend emailSign up for Latest NewsEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.ΔSupport Our workDonate Today!About UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual Reports & FinancialsNewsNARF NewsGet the LatestNARF Legal ReviewIndian Law News BulletinsOur WorkCases & ProjectsIssues & PrioritiesResources & PublicationsNational Indian Law LibrarySUPPORT USDonate OnlinePlanned GivingOnline StoreLog-In to Your AccountContact UsRequest HelpJoin Our TeamNative American Rights FundBoulder, CO (303) 447-8760Anchorage, AK (907) 276-0680Washington, DC (202) 785-4166Connect With UsFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinked InRSS feedDisclaimerPrivacy Policy© 2022 Native American Rights Fund
