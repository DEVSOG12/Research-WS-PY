His accounting of why and how the United States inflicted torture ondetainees offers a new window into the extreme abuses that occurred and theperverse efforts to develop and justify these criminal techniques.Showing little remorse, the discredited psychologist said he “would doit again.” He also reportedly testifiedthat the CIA took the program beyond where he was willing to take it.As nearly two decades of Physiciansfor Human Rights (PHR) research and advocacy have made clear, the post-September11 U.S. torture program constituted a systematic, illegal, and unethical regime of human rights violations. The complicityof health professionals like Dr. James Mitchell and his collaborator, Dr. BruceJessen, represents one of the gravest breaches ofmedical ethics in U.S. history.PHR published a series of groundbreaking reports and papersanalyzing the severe pain and suffering caused by the so-called enhancedinterrogation techniques, a euphemism for torture, and documenting the U.S.government’s authorization and use of these criminal interrogation methods ondetainees. PHR has also exposed the unethical and illegal role of healthprofessionals in the development and implementation of these violations ofhuman rights:PHR’s 2017 report  “NurembergBetrayed” showed that CIA contract psychologists James Mitchell and BruceJessen created a research program in which health professionals designed andapplied torture techniques and collected data on torture’s effects.PHR’s 2015 briefing paper “Truth Matters,” based on the Senatetorture report, analyzed the operational goal of Mitchell and Jessen to destroyhuman beings using methods and practices long recognized as torture.PHR’s 2014 report “Doing Harm” analyzed evidence of medical complicity intorture and showed how health professionals who participated in the CIA tortureprogram violated core ethical principles common to all healing professions.A curated list of research relevant to Mitchell’s testimonyand health professionals’ complicity in torture is included at the bottom ofthis release.In response to Dr. Mitchell’s Guantánamo testimony, psychologist Dr. Stephen Soldz – PHR anti-torture advisor and a leading expert on the roles of psychologists in U.S. detention abuses – provided the following statement. Dr. Soldz is available for interview; please contact media@phr.org for more information.“This week’s testimony by former CIA contract psychologist Dr. JamesMitchell illustrates yet again the brutality of the U.S. government’s decisionto resort to torture after 9/11. It also reflects what a profound mistake it isto have psychologists serve as interrogators or intelligence officers.Psychologists are professionals dedicated to improving the welfare andrelieving the suffering of people; they commit to ‘do no harm.’“The role of psychologists in national security interrogations has beena subject of major debate within the psychological profession and its largestassociation, the American Psychological Association (APA), since shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Thisparticipation was defended by claims that psychologist involvement would keepinterrogations ‘safe, legal, ethical, and effective.’ While Dr. Mitchell’stestimony is still in its early stages, it has already revealed the absurdity ofthis argument.“Regardless of any claims made by the CIA at the time of the tortureprogram, experience since then has definitively shown that the program was not ‘safe.’Follow-up psychological evaluations of those tortured by the CIA have shownthat many suffered severe, life-altering psychological harm that undercut anyclaim that the ‘enhanced interrogation’ techniques were not torture.“After such harm has been clearly documented, the fact that Dr.Mitchell told the court today that he would ‘do it again’ is appalling.“In his testimony, Dr. Mitchell also detailed what he called ‘abusivedrift’ among staff and authorizing officials that caused already-vicious interrogationsto become even more brutal. Dr. Mitchell described his failure to constrainsuch ‘drift’ toward ever greater violence, reporting that his continuedinvolvement in the detainee interrogation program was contingent upon himagreeing to escalating levels of brutality, authorized by U.S. governmentsuperiors.“Dr. Mitchell’s testimony also illustrated how psychological expertisecan be exploited to provide a scientific patina for torture while offering sanitizedlanguage to protect its promoters from fully grappling with its inherentviolence. Dr. Mitchell provided a supposedly scientific theory – learnedhelplessness – as a rationale for torture. He further claimed that theexperience of U.S. service members, who were voluntarily subjected totime-limited, milder versions of torture techniques under highly controlledconditions in the military’s SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape)program, provided evidence that the techniques were ‘safe’ when applied involuntarilywith much greater intensity against helpless and imprisoned detainees. Thesedetainees were already subjected to highly stressful and terrifying conditionsof confinement, such as continual darkness, constant white noise, and chainingin painful conditions for long periods.“Dr. Mitchell’s testimony should provoke deep soul-searching among thepsychology community about how to preserve the ethical foundations of theprofession. I hope it will lead to an examination of how national securityoperations can be inconsistent with the psychological profession’s imperativeto ‘do no harm.’”Dr. Soldz Bio:Dr. Soldz, a clinical psychologist and professorat the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, co-founded the Coalition foran Ethical Psychology. The Coalition has been in the forefront of efforts towithdraw psychologists from aiding abusive interrogations in U.S. Department ofDefense and CIA facilities. Dr. Soldz has published numerous professionalarticles, book chapters, and popular articles on U.S. torture, the roles ofpsychologists and the American Psychological Association in U.S. detentionabuses, and related areas of professional ethics. Dr. Soldz has been apsychological consultant on several Guantánamo detainee legal cases. Dr. Soldzis a past president of Psychologists for Social Responsibility and is a memberof the APA’s Council of Representatives. He is an anti-torture advisor forPhysicians for Human Rights and was a co-author of PHR’s reports “Experiments in Torture” and “Doing Harm.”Additionally, psychologist Dr. Steven Reisner – PHR psychological ethics advisor and a leading expert on the roles of psychologists in U.S. detention abuses – provided the following statement on Dr. Mitchell’s testimony. Dr. Reisner is available for interview; please contact media@phr.org.“JamesMitchell once again uses alleged threats to the homeland to justify America’sviolation of the domestic and international laws against torture. Hisstatements are consistent with similar arguments offered by the JusticeDepartment under the Bush administration – that the ‘gloves come off’ and therule of law can be abandoned whenever the government deems it appropriate.“However, for thousands ofyears, doctors have taken an oath to use their skills in the interest of doinggood, which can be a check on the potential excesses of government orauthority. Psychologists adhere to an ethics code with an identical mandate to‘do no harm.’”“James Mitchell is a livingexample of the harm doctors and psychologists do when they deviate from thisethical obligation. We are living in a time when government policy isdetermined less by law or ethical practice, but by the whim and power of theexecutive branch. We are living in a time when the President shows his supportfor those who torture and commit war crimes. The danger we face as a societywhen we acquiesce to hate-driven justifications for abuse and torture is great.We lose our very humanity and act as a frightened mob.“Speakingas a Jew whose parents were tortured – my mother by the Nazis and my father bythe Soviets – I know how easy it is for governments to use fear and rage tojustify cruelty and abuse. The only protection we have in such times is forcitizens and professionals to refuse to violate human rights and their own ethicalstandards. It is time for every health professional and every citizen to speakout in response to James Mitchell’s justifications for torture.”“Theresimply can be no justification for torture. Physicians for Human Rights hasdocumented the slippery slope doctors and psychologists go down once the firsttorture protocol is accepted. Hundreds of detainees were tortured and no usefulinformation was garnered from the effort. But the United States became a morebrutal country and our people have become more willing to accept government-approvedatrocity. Overruling the laws against torture, cruel, inhuman, or degradingtreatment threatens the character of our nation and the rule of law – not onlyfor detainees but for all of us.”Dr. Reisner Bio:Dr. Steven Reisner, aclinical psychologist and political activist, co-founded the Coalition for anEthical Psychology. The Coalition has been in the forefront of efforts tochange the ethics policy of the American Psychological Association, making itclearly a violation of its ethics code for psychologists to be present at sitesthat systematically violate international human rights law or to participate innational security interrogations. Dr. Reisner has been a consultant on issuesof trauma, torture, political violence, disaster, and resilience for the UnitedNations, the International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe, and otherinternational organizations. He is the creator and host of MADNESS: ThePodcast, which works to bring psychology back to its primary position of servingthe people rather than serving either the government or capitalism. Dr. Reisnerhas published in and interviewed for the nation’s leading news outlets and hasbeen on the teaching faculty of the clinical psychology program at ColumbiaUniversity, the international trauma studies program at New York University,the NYU Medical School, the Psychoanalytic Association of New York, and theWomen’s Therapy Center Institute. Dr.Reisner is a psychological ethics advisor to PHR and was a co-author on the PHRreport Experiments in Torture.Additional resources related to the U.S. torture program and health professionals’ participation:Break Them Down: Systematic Use ofPsychological Torture by U.S. ForcesAs evidence of U.S. national security interrogation practicesemerged, it became clear that psychologically abusive methods of interrogationwere at the core of U.S. intelligence gathering. “Break ThemDown,” published by PHR in May 2005, was the first comprehensive review ofthe use of psychological torture by U.S. forces, examining the devastatinghealth consequences of psychological coercion and explaining how a regime ofpsychological torture was put into place in the U.S. “war on terror”.Leave No Marks: Enhanced InterrogationTechniques and the Risk of CriminalityThis landmark report for the first time revealed and documentedmedical evidence confirming the first-hand accounts of the excruciating painand continued suffering of men who, never charged with any crime, enduredtorture at U.S. detention facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantánamo Bay.PHR-mobilized health professionals conducted intensive clinical evaluations ofthe men, documenting practices used to bring about long-lasting pain, terror,humiliation, and shame. The report demonstrated that the authorization of thesetechniques, whether practiced alone or in combination, may constitute tortureand/or cruel and inhuman treatment, and may place interrogators at seriouslegal risk of prosecution for war crimes and other violations.Experiments in Torture: Evidence of HumanSubject Research and Experimentation in the “Enhanced” Interrogation ProgramPHR’s 2010 publication, “Experiments in Torture,” is thefirst report to reveal evidence indicating that U.S. military and intelligencemedical personnel allegedly engaged in illegal experimentation on prisonerscaptured after 9/11, in addition to the previously disclosed crime oftorture. Those experiments observed and analyzed the physical andpsychological impact on detainees of the use of “enhanced interrogationtechniques.”Doing Harm: Health Professionals’ Central Rolein the CIA Torture ProgramOn December 9, 2014, the U.S. Senate Select Committee onIntelligence released the executive summary, findings, and conclusions of its6,700-page report on the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program. Thisdetailed review of the 500-page executive summary analyzesevidence of medical complicity in torture and shows how health professionalswho participated in the CIA torture program violated core ethical principlescommon to all healing professions.Truth Matters: Accountability for CIAPsychological TortureThe Senate torture report documents the abuses that followed thedevelopment of a comprehensive program of detainee torture by CIA personnelwith the help of psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen. Thisbriefing paper, based on the Senate torture report, analyzes the operationalgoal of Mitchell and Jessen and its effect in destroying human beings usingmethods and practices long recognized as torture.Nuremberg Betrayed: Human Experimentation andthe CIA Torture ProgramBased on an analysis of thousands of pages of documents and yearsof research, PHR shows that the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program constituted anillegal, unethical regime of experimental research on unwilling humansubjects. In thisreport, PHR researchers show that CIA contract psychologists JamesMitchell and Bruce Jessen created a research program in which healthprofessionals designed and applied torture techniques and collected data ontorture’s effects. This constitutes one of the gravest breaches of medicalethics by U.S. health personnel since the Nuremberg Code was developed in thewake of Nazi medical atrocities committed during World War Two.Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.
