SueZann witnessed her father, Rev. Billy Bosler be stabbed to death in their parsonage before she herself was stabbed and left for dead. Her faith and her father taught forgiveness, and she took that to heart – advocating that her attacker not receive the death penalty.Bring a friend to share in a powerful presentation about love, healing, forgiveness and justice, as well as an update on the legal system and the death penalty in Ohio.Why? The next governor takes office with an execution less than 30 days into his term, and 23 more executions already scheduled into 2023. Join us to learn more. Our goal is to stop executions while advocating for better services for all Ohio homicide survivors rather than the false hopes offered by the promise of an unlikely execution at some point decades in the future.Tuesday October 30th6:30pm to 8:00pmIJPC 215 E. 14th St in CincinnatiPlease RSVP for free tickets hereFor more information please contact abe@deathpenaltyaction.org or 800-973-6548.Thanks to Faith in Public Life, Ohioans to Stop Executions, Journey of Hope…From Violence to Healing, Death Penalty Action, and others….Add to calendarGoogle CalendariCalendarOutlook 365Outlook LiveDetailsDate:October 30, 2018Time:6:30 pm - 8:00 pmWebsite:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/healing-power-of-forgiveness-how-the-death-penalty-fails-victim-families-tickets-51414830141VenueIJPC215 E 14th StreetCincinnati,OH45202United States+ Google MapPhone:513-579-8547View Venue Website« Colores, Voces y Expresiones Art Exhibit (9/28 – 10/26)Documented Screening – Xavier University »Search for:Sign Up Sign up for issue-specific emails and important updates from IJPC!Sign UpDonate to IJPC IJPC’s non-profit status means that it relies on your contributions to provide essential programming and work for justice.
