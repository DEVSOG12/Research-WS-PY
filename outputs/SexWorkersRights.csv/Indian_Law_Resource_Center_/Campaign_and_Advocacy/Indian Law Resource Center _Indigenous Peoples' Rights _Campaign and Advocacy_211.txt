She was honored by the United South and Eastern Tribes for her work to pass the historic tribal criminal jurisdiction provisions in the Violence Against Women Act of 2013. Ms. Henry has served on the Board of Directors of the Indian Law Resource Center for seven years.Ms. Henry is an internationally recognized expert on combating violence against indigenous women. In 2011, she was part of the Permanent Forum’s Expert Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women, and was instrumental in bringing the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women to the Qualla Boundary, the territory of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. As a result of the visit, the Rapporteur’s report makes concrete recommendations regarding the necessity of local indigenous juridical systems in combating violence against indigenous women that continue to be referenced and cited by indigenous advocates and UN independent experts. Ms. Henry serves as the Co-chair of the National Congress of American Indians Task Force on Violence against Women. In that role, she has helped submit a number of joint written statements to the UN Human Rights Council and its special procedures, including the Special Rapporteurs on the rights of indigenous peoples and on violence against women, the Working Group on discrimination against women in law and practice, and the Universal Periodic Review of the United States, as well as the Commission on the Status of Women.
