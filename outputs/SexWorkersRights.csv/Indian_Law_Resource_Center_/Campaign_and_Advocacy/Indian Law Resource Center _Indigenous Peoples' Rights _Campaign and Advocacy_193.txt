Many have disappeared completely."Almost all of our projects, including our work with the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council in Alaska and the Yukon Territory and with the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre Tribes of the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, address the inextricable relationship between land rights, environmental health, and human rights.Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Takes #NODAPL to the United NationsRepresentatives from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, today to garner international opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the reservation.Read more about Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Takes #NODAPL to the United NationsTribes, Conservation Groups File Motion to Support Rigorous Environmental Review of Little Rockies MiningMining company challenging State of Montana decision to require comprehensive review of mining activityRead more about Tribes, Conservation Groups File Motion to Support Rigorous Environmental Review of Little Rockies MiningIn Peru, Indigenous are Fighting Drug TraffickersDuring the pandemic, some Latin American countries were so focused on dealing with Covid that they got distracted from other menaces like drug dealing.
