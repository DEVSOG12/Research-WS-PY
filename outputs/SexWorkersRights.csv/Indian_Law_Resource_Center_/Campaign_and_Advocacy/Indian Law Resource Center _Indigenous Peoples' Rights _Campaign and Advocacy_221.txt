In preparation of its report, the U.S. State Department requested comments from Non-governmental Organizations and Indian nations.  The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and the Indian Law Resource Center both submitted comments to the State Department focusing on the horrible problem of violence against Native women in Indian country. The statistics are staggering: one in three Native women will be raped in her lifetime; four in five women will be violently assaulted; and six in ten experience domestic abuse.  Sadly, the majority of these women never see their abusers or rapists brought to justice. The complex jurisdictional scheme in Indian country leaves Native women without effective judicial recourse against their perpetrators.NCAI and the Indian Law Resource Center both met with State Department officials to educate them about violence against Native women and encourage them to include the issue in their state report to the Human Rights Council.Although there were numerous other NGOs and Indian nations that submitted comments to the State Department, there were no other submissions that specifically addressed gender issues or violence against women.  Nonetheless, based on the advocacy of NCAI and the Center, the State Department specifically mentioned the problem of violence against Native women in its Report, stating that “Addressing crimes involving violence against women and children on tribal lands is a priority” of this Administration. We are very encouraged by the State Department’s inclusion of this issue in its Report.    We are hopeful that the UN Human Rights Council will prioritize this issue in its review of the United States, thereby increasing the international pressure on the U.S. to respond to this crisis.    For more information about the Center's work to protect the rights of Native women in the United States and through international law, visit our Safe Women, Strong Nation web page www.indianlaw.org/safewomen.SiteWorking to protect the legal rights, cultures and environments of Indian nations and other indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1978.About UsWe are a non-proﬁt law and advocacy organization.ContinueSubscribeSubscribe to Indigenous Notes for the latest news from the Center.Email:Take ActionHelp Support and Protect Indigenous Rights.ContinueAboutBoard of DirectorsStaffEmploymentInternshipsAnnual ReportsFinancial InformationContact UsIssuesEnding Violence Against Native WomenEnvironmental ProtectionHUMAN RIGHTSLAND RIGHTSLaw ReformNATIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF-GOVERNANCEPROTECTING SACRED SITESProjectsLAW REFORMMultilateral Development BanksThe American Declaration on The Rights of Indigenous PeoplesWorld Conference on Indigenous PeoplesContact UsMain Office602 North Ewing StreetHelena, MT 59601406.449.2006mt@indianlaw.orgD.C.
