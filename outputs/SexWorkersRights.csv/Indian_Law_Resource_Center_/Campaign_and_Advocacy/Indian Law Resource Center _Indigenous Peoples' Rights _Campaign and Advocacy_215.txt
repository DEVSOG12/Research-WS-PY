Senator Lisa Murkowski reintroduced the bill in 2019, and it was passed by the Senate in March 2020.  Savanna’s Act clarifies federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement responsibilities with respect to missing or murdered Indians; aims to increase communication and coordination between federal, tribal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; improves tribal access to resources and information such as the federal criminal information databases needed to respond effectively to missing and murdered Indian cases; requires data collection related to missing and murdered Indian people, regardless of where they reside; and directs U.S. attorneys to develop regionally appropriate guidelines for responding to missing or murdered Indians.The Not Invisible Act, S.982, introduced in April 2019, is intended to “increase intergovernmental coordination to identify and combat violent crime within Indian lands and of Indians.”  The Act establishes a Joint Commission on Reducing Violent Crimes Against Indians  of local, tribal, and federal stakeholders from diverse geographic areas that will make publicly available recommendations to the Departments of Interior and of Justice on best practices both departments can take to combat disappearances, murder, trafficking, and other violent crimes against Native Americans and Alaska Natives.  Not later than 90 days after their receipt, the Secretary of the Interior and Attorney General must each make public written responses to the recommendations. The Joint Commission is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and a sunset provision terminates the Joint Commission 2 years after the date of the enactment of the Act. These new laws represent an overdue first step by the United States in responding to the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and fulfilling its “[f]ederal trust responsibility to assist tribal governments in safeguarding the lives of Indian women.”[1]For additional information:Enrolled Bill – S.227S.
