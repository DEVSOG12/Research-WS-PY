The Association was formed in 1922 to change the destructive path of federal policy from assimilation, termination and allotment, to sovereignty, self-determination and self-sufficiency. Throughout its 100-year history, the Association has provided national advocacy on watershed issues that support sovereignty and culture, while working on the ground at a grassroots level with Tribes to support the implementation of programs that affect lives on the ground.The Association is governed by an all-Native American Board of Directors from across Indian country. As a membership organization, the Association speaks with unified voices from all over the country, both Native and non-Native together, to protect sovereignty, preserve culture, educate youth and build capacity.Annual Reports and FinancialsThe Association's Board of Directors​Diverse Indian Country AdvocatesPresident Frank Ettawageshik (Odawa)Vice President Jonathan Perry (Wampanoag)TreasurerJoseph Daniels, Sr.(Forest County Potawatomi)SecretaryDeeAnn DeRoin, MD(Ioway)Board Member Alfred R.
