When we think of the mental damage caused by this system and the fact that it does little to prevent future crimes by these inmates one has to conclude that these costs are way too high to continue to bare.To make the point stick I hope that someone can get a hold of the number held in the remaining 42 states. And also the average number incounty jails and juvenile facilities on any given day?It must be an exponentially larger number than 44K.It’s enough to make the Statue of Liberty shed a tear.Land of the free, yeah right, until with the countless laws on the books, we are not, then we become mere numbers on a balance sheet and left mentally scared while bearing a scarlet letter for life. How do we go on from that point?ReplyMary Lou BrncikMarch 20, 2012 at 1:17 amThank you Solitary Watch and Sal for this great report. Makes our work as advocates so much easier to have this hard to find data at our finder tips. I will use it often and will recommend Solitary Watch as a must read for those involved in criminal justice reform.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
