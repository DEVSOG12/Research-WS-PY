Solitary Confinement  
and the Law  News from a Nation in Lockdown

“A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a 
short confinement, into a semi -fatuous condition, from 
which it was next to impossible to arouse them, and others 
became violently insane, others, still, committed suicide, 
while those who stood the ordeal better were not generally 
reformed, and in most cases did not recover sufficient 
mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the com-
munity.”  
—U.S. Supreme Court, In re Medley, 134 U.S. 160, 168 
(1890)  
The United States began employing solitary confinement in 
its penal institutions more than 200 years ago, and its 
harmful effects were almost immediately apparent and 
acknowledged by the Supreme Court.1 However, with the 
exception of limited legislation in a handful of states re-
stricting the use of solitary confinement for the mentally 
infirm,2 there are no laws in the United States prohibiting 
the practice.  
The main tools used to challenge solitary confinement are 
the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitu-
tion. Even when applying these weighty standards, the 
courts have still not found the use of solitary confinement 
by itself to be unconstitutional.  
The Eighth Amendment  
The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits cruel 
and unusual punishment. The Supreme Court has held that 
this standard can be applied to prison conditions, including 
solitary confinement.3 However, with one exception,4 no 
court has found that solitary confinement violates the 
Eighth Amendment.  
To show an Eighth Amendment violation, a two -part test 
must be met: 1) the action or condition must be objectively 
serious, and 2) prison officials must be ―deliberately indif-
ferent‖ to the harm caused by the action or condition.5  
This analysis was applied in the leading case of Madrid v. 
Gomez, a class action suit brought by prisoners in Califor-
nia’s Pelican Bay State Prison alleging a range of Eighth 
Amendment violations including excessive force, inade-
quate physical and mental health care and inhumane condi-
tions in the prison’s Secure Housing Unit. Regarding the 
first prong of the Eighth Amendment test, the court found 
that ―[t]he Eighth Amendment simply does not guarantee 
that inmates will not suffer some psychological effects from 
incarceration or segregation.‖6 The Gomez court ruled that the degree of psychological 
trauma inflicted on the average prisoner is not enough by 
itself to create an Eighth Amendment violation. However, 
for prisoners with pre -existing mental health conditions 
and those with an unreasonably high risk of suffering men-
tal illness, being subjected to solitary confinement condi-
tions may be serious enough to constitute cruel and unusual 
punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, accord-
ing to the court.7  
Regarding the second prong of the Eighth Amendment 
analysis, the Gomez court found the deliberate indifference 
requirement was met, as prison officials were aware of the 
mental health risks of placing prisoners in solitary, yet did it 
regardless.8  
The Gomez court, along with most courts that have ad-
dressed the issue of solitary confinement, dealt only with 
short -term stays in solitary. However, according to the Su-
preme Court, the ―length of confinement cannot be ignored‖ 
in determining whether a particular restriction constitutes 
cruel and unusual punishment.9 No court has specifically 
addressed claims of prisoners who have been confined to 
solitary on a virtually permanent basis, and this may be an 
area ripe for future litigation.10 
The Fourteenth Amendment and Due Process  
The Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
holds that no state may ―deprive any person of life, liberty 
or property, without due process of law.‖ ―Due process‖ 
generally requires a hearing before an impartial decision -
maker during which evidence can be presented and an indi-
vidual can defend his or her interests, even if in a very infor-
mal manner. To make a due process challenge, a plaintiff 
must first show that his or her right to life, liberty or prop-
erty is threatened.  
When applied in the prison context, the courts have consist-
ently stated that prisoners retain only the most limited lib-
erty interests and courts are exceedingly deferential to the 
decisions of prison administrators.11 
In Wilkinson v. Austin, the Supreme Court examined the 
procedures used in assigning prisoners to Ohio’s supermax 
facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary. The Court determined 
that prisoners do have a protected liberty interest in avoid-
ing placement in a supermax facility.12 However, in coming 
to its decision, the court distinguished between the indefi-
niteness of supermax placement as opposed to the tempo-
rary nature of disciplinary segregation.13 2 Regarding disciplinary segregation, the Court ruled in 
Sandin v. Conner that prisoners have no liberty interest in 
being taken out of the general prison population and tem-
porarily placed in administrative segregation because the 
nature of the conditions in solitary ―did not present a dra-
matic departure from the basic conditions of [the in-
mate’s] sentence.‖14 The Court implied that if a transfer 
were to impose ―atypical and significant hardship on the 
inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life‖ 
a liberty interest may be found, however no definitive 
baseline for that standard has yet been defined.15 
If a liberty interest is implicated, adequate due process 
must then be provided. In Wilkinson, the Supreme Court 
required that a prisoner be given a statement of reasons 
for why he or she is being assigned to a supermax facility 
and there be an opportunity for the prisoner to be heard on the issue. After a decision is made, a short statement of 
reasons must be provided.16 
The Supreme Court has also ruled that meaningful period-
ic hearings must be held to ensure that administrative seg-
regation is not a ―pretext for indefinite confinement.‖17 
Scholars and advocates express concerns that in the su-
permax context, any periodic hearing held is a mere for-
mality without any true review of the individual’s situa-
tion.18 Were a claimant to definitively show that these re-
views were a sham or the outcome was predetermined, it 
would be a violation of due process.19 
International Standards  
The Supreme Court acknowledges that its interpretation 
of the Eighth Amendment must not be ―static‖20 and the 
Court is increasingly looking to international standards to 
define ―cruel and unusual punishment.‖21  
European bodies have taken a particularly progressive 
view on the use of solitary confinement, allowing it only 
after a medical examination certifies the prisoner fit to 
sustain the isolation and with daily monitoring of the pris-
oner’s psychological state.22 Additionally, the Council of 
Europe’s European Committee for the Prevention of Tor-
ture stated that solitary confinement can rise to the level 
of inhuman and degrading treatment and ―should be as 
short as possible.‖23 
The Committee Against Torture — the governing body of 
the Convention Against Torture, to which the United 
States is a party — has recommended that solitary confine-
ment be abolished entirely because of its potentially harm-
ful effects on prisoners’ mental and physical health.24
