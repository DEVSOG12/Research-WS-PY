  Fact  Sheet:  
The  High Cost of  
Solitary Confinement  News from a Nation in Lockdown  
www.solitarywatch.com  
In the United States today, at least 80,000 prisoners are in 
some form of isolated confinement,1 including some 25,000 
in supermax prisons.2 Solitary confinement goes by many 
names, including administrative segregation, disciplinary 
confinement, security housing, and restricted housing, but it 
normally consists of 22 – to 24 -hour lockdown in a small 
cell. Terms in solitary confinement often extend to months, 
years, or decades.  
Solitary confinement has been found to cause serious psy-
chological damage. Studies have also shown that it increases 
recidivism and fails to reduce prison violence.1 
Solitary confinement is also expensive, in large part because 
of added staffing costs. One study estimated that the aver-
age per -cell cost of housing an inmate in a supermax prison 
is $75,000, as opposed to $25,000 for an inmate in the gen-
eral population.3 
While many states do not publish data on the costs of isolat-
ed confinement in their prisons, a survey of available figures 
clearly reveals the high price of solitary .  
California  
With over 1,100 inmates in the Security Housing Unit 
(SHU) and 400 more in the Administrative Segregation 
Unit (ASU), Pelican Bay State Prison has an yearly budget of 
$180 million. For 2010 -2011, the annual costs per inmate 
were as follows:  
 $70, 641 per SHU inmate  
 $77,740 per ASU inmate  
 $58,324 per general population inmate 4 
According to the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitations, the average length of time spent in the Peli-
can Bay SHU is 6.8 years.5 This means the total cost of hold-
ing each inmate in the SHU is on average $480,358. Hous-
ing the same inmate in the general population would save 
$83,733.  
Some 2,2oo additional prisoners are housed in SHUs at Cor-
coran State Prison and CCI Calipatria.5 This brings the 
statewide total in SHU confinement to approximately 3,700. 
Assuming costs are consistent across state prisons, at 
$12,317 more per inmate, the added cost of SHU confine-
ment comes to $45.6 million annually.   
In addition, a 2009 report from the California Office of the 
Inspector General estimated “the annual correctional staff 
cost of a standard ASU bed to be at least $14,600 more than 
the equivalent general population bed. For the 8,878 ASU beds statewide, this additional cost equates to nearly $130 
million a year.”6 
Taking in the costs of SHU and ASU combined, solitary con-
finement costs California taxpayers an additional $175 mil-
lion a year.  
Illinois  
Calculations carried out by reporters at the Belleville News -
Democrat found that it costs $92,000 per year to hold an 
inmate in solitary confinement at Illinois’s Tamms Correc-
tional Center. The figure is two to three time higher than the 
cost of keeping an inmate at the state’s other maximum -
security prisons.7 
According to the 2009 Annual Report of the Illinois Depart-
ment of Corrections, Tamms held 417 inmates, 243 of whom 
who were in solitary confinement.  In 2009, total expendi-
tures at Tamms amounted to over $28 million. By compari-
son, Taylorville Correctional Center spent $25 million with 
nearly three times the population of Tamms (1201). In 2010, 
following a reduction of Tamms’s supermax population 
(from 243 to 208), costs fell to $25 million.8  
Colorado  
According to figures compiled by the ACLU of Colorado, in 
2010 it cost $14,933 to $21,485 more per inmate, per year to 
hold someone in administrative segregation in the state’s 
supermax prisons than in a regular maximum security pris-
on ($42,642 -$48,403 vs. $26,918 to $27,709).9 
With 1,400 prisoners in administrative segregation 
statewide,9 the additional annual cost of solitary confine-
ment in Colorado that year exceeded $20 million.  
Other States  
In 2003, the cost of housing a level 5 Administrative Maxi-
mum, or “supermax,” inmate at Ohio State Penitentiary was 
$149 daily and $54,385 a year. The cost of housing a maxi-
mum -security inmate was $101 a day and $26,865 a year. 
For general population inmates the cost was $63 a day or 
$22,995 a year --less than half the cost of an Administrative 
Segregation inmate.2 
In 2002, the cost of housing an inmate in the general popu-
lation in Texas was $42.46 per day. The cost of housing a 
prisoner in administrative segregation was 45 percent high-
er, at $61.63 per day.10 At the time, Texas held approximate-
ly 9,000 prisoners in administrative segregation, with an 
additional yearly cost to taxpayers of almost $63 million.

Washington, DC 20008 / solitarywatchnews@gmail.com.  In the year 2000, it cost three times more to house an in-
mate in the supermax Maryland Correctional Adjustment 
Center than in the general population.11 
Federal Prisons  
The Federal Bureau of Prisons holds more than 11,000 pris-
oners in some form of segregation, including about 400 in 
its supermax prison, the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative 
Maximum, or ADX, in Florence, Colorado.12 The BOP says 
it does not know the cost of  holding an inmate in ADX.  
A  Freedom of Information Act request from Solitary Watch 
for the annual cost of housing a prisoner at ADX yielded the 
following response: "The BOP does not collect separate or 
specific data held in Administrative custody or at USP Ad-
min Max Florence. These costs are included in the general 
per capita costs for the applicable facility. Since the prisons 
at Florence make up a Federal Correctional Complex 
[which also has maximum, medium, and minimum security 
inmates], the operating costs are based on all complex op-
erations, shared services and facility expenses at this site."  
Construction Costs  
In addition to higher operating costs, supermax prisons 
have consistently higher construction costs than other types 
of facilities —two to three times higher, according to one 
report, than a maximum -security prison.2 
Pelican Bay State Prison was built in 1989 at a cost of $230 
million13 to hold 1056 inmates,14 or, $217,803 per cell.  The Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center was build at 
a cost of $21 million (in 1989 dollars) to house 288 in-
mates, or, a cost of over $72,000 per bed.15 
Wisconsin’s Boscobel supermax facility was built to house 
500 inmates at a cost of $47.5 million (in 1990 dollars), or 
over $95,000 per bed.15 
The federal supermax, ADX Florence, was completed in 
1994 at a cost of $60 million —over $122,000 for each of its 
490 beds.16 
Tamms Correctional Center cost $73 million to build in 
1998 and was designed to hold 500 inmates. This gives a 
construction price tag of approximately $146,000 per bed.17   
Ohio State Penitentiary, likewise constructed to house 500 
supermax inmates, cost taxpayers $50 million to build, or 
$100,000 per bed.17 
Reforms Lead to Savings  
Spurred by litigation, legislation, leadership, and local ac-
tivism, a handful of states have recently taken steps to re-
duce the number of prisoners they hold in solitary —a move 
that has clear fiscal benefits.  
In recent years, Mississippi has reduced the number of 
prisoners it holds in  solitary from 1,000 to about 150, and 
closed down its supermax unit. According to the ACLU, the 
reforms are saving Mississippi’s taxpayers an estimated $8 
million a year.18
