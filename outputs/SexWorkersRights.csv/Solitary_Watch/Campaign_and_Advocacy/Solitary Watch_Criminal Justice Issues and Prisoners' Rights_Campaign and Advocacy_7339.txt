Bybee, former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, said in testimony released Thursday by the House Judiciary Committee that the CIA went further in its tough tactics than he had outlined as permissible in a widely criticized legal memoranda.” Bybee had appeared before the committee on May 26th.Bybee says the memos he co-wrote with lawyer John C. Yoo “authorized waterboarding only if there were no ‘substantial repetitions'”–in other word, as long as they didn’t do it too much. CIA contractors ended up waterboarding suspects as many as 183 times. “Extended solitary confinement or isolation” was also named as one of the unauthorized practices, according to the LA Times account:Among the other techniques reportedly used on CIA detainees that were not approved by the Justice Department, Bybee testified, were diapering a detainee, forcing a detainee to defecate on himself, forcing a detainee to wear blackout goggles, extended solitary confinement or isolation, hanging a detainee from ceiling hooks, daily beatings, spraying cold water on a detainee, and subjecting a detainee to high-volume music or noise.“So if these things occurred, dousing with cold water, subjecting to loud music to keep people from falling asleep, if that occurred, that means they were done without specific [Justice Department] authorization?” Bybee was asked by the committee.“That’s right,” Bybee replied.Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers said the revelation that “many brutal techniques reportedly used in CIA interrogations were not authorized by the Justice Department” could be “highly relevant to the pending criminal investigation of detainee abuse.”Some 100,000 U.S. prisoners are being held in solitary confinement on American soil on any given day, and at least 25,000 are in “extended solitary confinement” in supermax prisons and units. If the use of such practices is grounds for “criminal investigations,” why aren’t we seeing the federal Bureau of Prisons and state correctional systems investigated, as well?Jay Bybee, by the way, is still involved in the justice system, back on home turf: He is now a federal judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCivil Liberties/Civil Rights,Constitution,Eighth Amendment,extended solitary confinement,Federal Prisons,House Judiciary Committee,Human Rights,Jay Bybee,John Conyers,Solitary Confinement,Supermax Prisons,Terrorism Cases,Torture,torture memos,waterboardingJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Its successful corrections union is a model for other states correction workers to follow.In this post it says;“Among the other techniques reportedly used on CIA detainees that were not approved by the Justice Department, Bybee testified, were diapering a detainee, forcing a detainee to defecate on himself, forcing a detainee to wear blackout goggles, extended solitary confinement or isolation, hanging a detainee from ceiling hooks, daily beatings, spraying cold water on a detainee, and subjecting a detainee to high-volume music or noise.”From your post titled:Louisiana Jail Locks Up Suicidal Prisoners in 3′ x 3′ Cages“Several witnesses report suicidal prisoners forced to wear orange short shorts (“Daisy Duke” style). Prisoners also report being forced to wear Daisy Duke shorts with “Hot Stuff” written on the rear end.Guards frequently ignore repeated requests to use the bathroom, forcing some desperate people to urinate in discarded containers.People have been reportedly held in these cages for days, weeks, and months.”I have previously read on this site, in connection to one of the Angola 3 that contrary to what one would expect if the inmate was released he would like to be left alone. It seems after years of inmates shouting, banging and howling while the constant high volume of the unit’s television blared until midnight he just wants peace and quiet.So the diapering, extended isolation, and high-volume noise are not approved by the Justice Department?It seems LA, but I am sure other states as well, have not paid much attention to the Justice Department’s guidelines. I can vouch that CA has not followed these guidelines.ReplyJoshlynJuly 16, 2010 at 6:00 pmdid you know inmates tested bio cemical agents for world war one and two or that they tesed a lot of drugs for
