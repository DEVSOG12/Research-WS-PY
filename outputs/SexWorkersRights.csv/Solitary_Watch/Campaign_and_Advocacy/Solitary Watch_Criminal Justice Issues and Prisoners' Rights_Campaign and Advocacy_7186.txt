Bush, Texas governor.He said it in June 2000, about granting a last-minute reprieve to death row inmate Ricky McGinn, who was seeking DNA testing of forensic evidence he claimed might exonerate him. (It didn’t, as it turned out, and McGinn was executed several months later.) Bush was running for president when he made his decision to delay the execution to allow for DNA testing.Today, Texas governor and presidential candidate Rick Perry faces an almost identical decision with the case of Hank Skinner—the main difference being a greater likelihood that Skinner might actually be innocent of the crime for which he has been sentenced to death. Skinner, who is scheduled for execution on November 9, was convicted in 1995 of killing his girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two adult sons. He insists he was passed out from intoxication at the time, and that the real perpetrator was probably Busby’s uncle (who has since died). At the time of his trial, Skinner’s lawyers chose not to have certain items tested, they said, because his DNA would likely be everywhere in the home he shared with the victim. But since 2000, Skinner has been arguing that there’s a chance DNA evidence could exonerate him.The odds of getting that chance from the Perry administration look  slim. On Skinner’s last scheduled execution date, in March 2010, it was  the US Supreme Court, not Perry, who issued an eleventh-hour stay…Read the rest on MotherJones.com.We will also be publishing excerpts from some of Hank Skinner’s own writings over the past several years.

He had the opportunity to have it tested PRE-trial, but declined on account of the other evidence being VERY inculpatory, & didn’t want any more of THAT.Tell me, if this evidence he DECLINED pre-trial to have analyzed could have possibly exonerated him, WOULDN’T HE HAVE USED IT IN HIS DEFENSE & BEEN ACQUITTED?The stark, obvious answer is “Yes.”If this evidence could NOT have exonerated him @ trial, pray tell–HOW can it exonerate him NOW?This is nothing else but a transparent attempt to buy more time from heading to the death chamber–for which I can’t, & don’t, blame him–anybody on death row would do this if given this chance that Skinner’s asking for. The TX Court of Criminal Appeals has stayed his execution pending its review of a newly-enacted law saying that Skinner can have previously UNtested DNA evidence analyzed–evidence he did not have tested for use in his defense @ his trial 10 years ago.I think the TCCA ought to turn his request for this DNA analysis DOWN. If it could’ve excluded him as the murderer @ his trial, he’d surely have had it tested & used it. What could not exonerate him THEN, caNOT exonerate him NOW.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
