Jenkins had sought $1.7 million in damages, claiming that his time in isolation had severely damaged his mental health and that prison officials had failed to provide him with appropriate treatment.• A reverend and a rabbi co-authored an op-ed on youth placement in solitary confinement for the Los Angeles Daily News. “Our religious traditions affirm the inherent human dignity of all people, and the particular importance of fostering the health and growth of children. Solitary confinement profoundly disrupts the developmental progress of youth. When we torture young people, we torture our future.”• A woman has sued the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, allegedly she was raped by a prison guard and subsequently placed in involuntary protective custody against her will. Marya Miranda also said she did not report the sexual assaults because she feared retaliation, but that the incidents had been reported by another prisoner.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,House of Representatives,Maricopa County,Nikko Jenkins,rape,Solitary Confinement,The Solitary Confinement Study and Reform Act,youthAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
