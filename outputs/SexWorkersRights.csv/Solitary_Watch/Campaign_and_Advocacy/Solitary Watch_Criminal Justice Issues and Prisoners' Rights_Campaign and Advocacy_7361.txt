Will Potter on Green Is the New Red, who has been tracking the CMUs for some time, provides all the relevant information in this post, which we are running in full. The comments section of the post includes sample statements that other readers have sent in.The federal Bureau of Prisons has quietly submitted a proposal to make the secretive, political prisons called Communications Management Units permanent.As part of that process, there is a required public comment period, where individuals and organizations can register their opposition. This is a process required by the Administrative Procedures Act, and it should have been followed three years ago when the first secretive facility opened; knowing that the plans would be met with fierce opposition, as previous proposals had been, the CMUs were opened secretly and illegally.With multiple lawsuits filed in opposition to the CMUs, and with public exposure increasing, the government is attempting to follow the law in hindsight.That’s why it’s so important to speak up, on record, against these unconstitutional facilities.A few points to remember, from some of the previous coverage here at GreenIsTheNewRed:The CMUs violate basic due process rights. Inmates are transferred to these experimental facilities without notification, and without opportunity for appeal. Most of the prisoners there do not have histories of communications violations or disciplinary problems of any kind. All prisoners have the right to know why they are being buy xanax with online consultation singled out for harsher punishment, and the right to challenge that designation in court. Communications Management Units place too much unchecked power in the hands of government officials.CMUs are cruel and inhumane and violate basic human rights. The restrictions there meet or exceed those at the most extreme prisons in the country. “I haven’t been able to hug my husband, or even hold his hand, for two years,” said Jenny Synan, the spouse of environmental activist, Daniel McGowan, who is a CMU prisoner. “This proposed rule does not explain how prohibiting a husband from holding his wife’s hand or keeping a father from hugging his daughter, is necessary for prison security.”Political prisons have no place in a democracy. The Bureau of Prisons proposal makes clear that the CMUs are intended to keep political prisoners with “inspirational significance” from communicating with the communities and social movements of which they are part. These secretive prisons are for political cases the government would rather have out of the public spotlight. As we have seen throughout history, singling out prisoners because of their political beliefs sets a dangerous precedent and is antithetical to democratic values.It’s easy to submit your comments online through Regulations.gov.Submit your comments by June 2nd!Again, you can find sample comments at the bottom of the original post; as time is short, it may be helpful to use these as models. The ACLU’s comments on CMUs can be found here.On a related subject–Green Is the New Red has also reported on the possibility that Greenpeace activists nonviolently protesting the BP oil spill could be charged as terrorists. (This follows earlier efforts by right-wing commentators to blame the spill on “eco-terrorists.”) Since other environmental activists have served stints in the CMUs, these protestors could conceivably become future residents.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsBureau of Prisons,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,CMU,Communications Management Unit,Due Process,Federal Prisons,Green Is the New Red,Political Prisoners,Solitary Confinement,Supermax Prisons,Terrorism CasesJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Most of the corrupt ones are also the most vocal in their own defence. At this very moment in time we have 4 major politicians on trial for criminal fraud in relation to this scandal – they have all tried to invoke a special act whereby the public should not be informed of what elected officials get up to – they really are the people who should become aquainted with these buildings.ReplyLiza BJune 2, 2010 at 11:48 pmWOW>. this is AMERICA?this is so sad,,,, I hope to gawd this sort of prison is reserved for ONLY politicians and members of the BOP and corrupt prison officials and employees…ReplyKate EdwardsJune 2, 2010 at 4:18 pmI just submitted a comment on the CMU’s. It looks as tho’ you can submit comments until June 7th.ReplyAlanJune 2, 2010 at 4:16 pmThe ACLU, joined by several other groups, including the Uptown People’s law Center where I work, has submitted extensive comments. They are available here: http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/bureau-prisons-should-shutter-secretive-and-isolated-communications-management-unitReplyMoiraJune 2, 2010 at 4:00 pmIt doesn’t seem to me to be the “right” thing to do to those that haven’t violated any policy. a family needs the touch of their loved ones. How is this wrong? what is wrong is making these people move without reason or ways to fight it…when will the BoP start looking at the human aspect and not the money?ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
