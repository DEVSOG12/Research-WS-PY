Moved to a larger room due to expected high turnout, the hearing will take place at 2:30 in Room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building. Those testifying include survivors of solitary, advocates, and corrections officials. Check back later in the week for a report on the hearing and an archive of written testimony.• After more than 22 consecutive years in solitary confinement, Russell Maroon Shoatz, widely considered a political prisoner, was released into general population at State Correctional Institution (SCI) Graterford in Pennsylvania.• In The New York Times, Rick Raemisch, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, describes what it was like to spend a night in solitary confinement: “I felt as if I’d been there for days. I sat with my mind. How long would it take before Ad Seg chipped that away? I don’t know, but I’m confident that it would be a battle I would lose.”• The U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education have filed statements in support of an on-going class action lawsuit filed against country authorities in Contra Costa, California. Last August, Berkley-based Disability Rights Advocates sued the county’s Probation Department and Office of Education in an effort to hold them responsible for placing young people with disabilities and mental illness in solitary confinement at Martinez Juvenile Hall.• In the Chicago Tribune, columnist and editorial board member Steve Chapman writes about “the high toll of solitary confinement.” The libertarian Chapman writes: “Politicians may be disinclined to worry about the use of extreme isolation, much less to take action to improve the treatment of criminals. But there are at least two good reasons for the law-abiding citizenry to care…The first is cost…The second reason is that most of these inmates won’t be incarcerated forever. The vast majority will be released back into society. Extreme isolation is about the worst possible training for living and working peaceably among others.”• Last Saturday the state of Maine marked the opening of the Intensive Mental Health Unit at Maine State Prison.  A psychologist at the unit explained that individuals incarcerated in Maine would now be given better treatment. “This a recovery place. The expectation is you will get better.”  The unit was constructed in the part of the prison that had been formerly used as a special management unit.• The New York Times released an editorial in support of the recently announced reforms to solitary confinement in New York State spurred by an NYCLU lawsuit.  The changes received widespread coverage, including in WYNC and elsewhere.• A Center for Investigate Reporting story was featured on PBS on the “Newshour,” covering the placement youth in solitary. The story focused on the large number of adolescents in solitary confinement on New York’s Rikers Island.• CNN covered last week’s annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where solitary confinement survivor Robert King and several experts testified about the psychological and physical effects of long-term isolation.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Colorado Department of Corrections,Contra Costa,Maine State Prison,New York Times,Rikers Island,Russell Maroon Shoatz,Solitary ConfinementAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
