The editorial, which strongly opposes the ballot measure, continues:In Colorado, if someone is arrested for a crime, one of the first things that frequently happens is a judge orders a defendant to be assessed by pretrial services. These government professionals interview the defendant, look at his or her criminal and personal history, and make recommendations about how and whether the defendant could be safely supervised while awaiting trial.Often, a judge will look at the recommendations and order pretrial supervision and what is called a personal recognizance bond. That is essentially a promise to appear, and it is usually given to defendants with a stable residence and a job. No money is involved.This system is good for the community because the defendant is supervised by professionals, is able to continue working, and the public isn’t paying to keep these lower-risk defendants in already overcrowded jails. Also, defendants don’t have to ante up bond, which is good for people who may not have the means to post a cash, property or surety bond. The goal is to keep communities safe and ensure defendants show up for their court dates.Now, back to Proposition 102. It is sponsored by bail bondsmen and would effectively force more defendants into using their services.The initiative would prevent nearly all defendants from being supervised via the aforementioned pretrial services program unless they posted a bond. Instead, most of them would end up remaining in costly jail cells.A coalition of Colorado prosecutors, defense lawyers, law enforcement and other judicial system professionals oppose Proposition 102.These folks have various interests in opposing it. For instance, the sheriffs who have to keep an eye on their corrections budgets predict the change would flood their jail cells with people who could safely be in the community while awaiting the disposition of their cases.Public defenders and defense lawyers see it as a way to force their clients, many of whom are of little financial means, to pay bail bondsmen a fee to have the bondsmen post their bail. If defendants can’t raise the cash to pay a bondsman, they’ll go to jail, potentially lose their jobs and leave their families without support, causing a host of other problems…ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesTagsbail bond industry,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Colorado,Due Process,Legislation,Politics of Punishment,pre-trial detention,Proposition 102,unequal justiceJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.
