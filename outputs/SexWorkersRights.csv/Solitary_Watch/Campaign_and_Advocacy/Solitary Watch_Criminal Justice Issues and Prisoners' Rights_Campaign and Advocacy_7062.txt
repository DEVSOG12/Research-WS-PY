Inmates in Uinta 1 may be there for disciplinary infractions, notoriety reasons, protective custody, or because they are security/escape risks. The unit is divided into eight sections with twelve inmates in each section, for a total of 96 maximum inmates. Currently, there are 90 inmates in Uinta 1. The Utah Department of Corrections, in response to a government records request by Solitary Watch, claims it has no records regarding its use of segregation.Several inmates have recently written Solitary Watch about the conditions in Uinta 1.L., who has been in Uinta 1 for five months and previously served 28 months there, reports that he is only able to leave his cell three days a week, for a shower and 1 hour alone in a concrete yard. He reports that, in being transported to a 15 minute shower, “we have to wear a spit mask over our faces and handcuffed from behind with a dog leash hooked to us.”“The rest of the time except on the shower days we are locked down in our cells with the door window closed so you can’t see out,” he writes.A., who has been in Uinta 1 for a year, adds that, “just the other day, the [Correctional Officers] came and shook our cells down and took away all of our hygiene. They took away shampoo, lotion, conditioner, everything…they also don’t give us anything to clean our cells with.”A. is in Uinta 1 for his own protection, following what he says was a decision to leave gang life after much “self-study.” Despite this, he says, he is treated as if he committed a  serious offense.Inmate Brandon Green, who has frequently written on the conditions of Uinta 1, describes the environment in Uinta 1 as reinforcing a vicious cycle in which inmates placed in solitary usually end up back not long after they are released. Green, who has been in Uinta 1 for five years, previously served 18 months in Uinta 1 before a brief period on parole before returning to Utah State Prison. He has been held in Uinta 1 following an escape attempt and refusal to take psychiatric drugs, which he says will only harm his health.“So alone. So much internal turbulence with nothing like T.V., radio, magazines or conversation to hide [this pain] beneath,” he writes, “a man leaves this place to go to general population or to a less secure facility where you have electronics and a cellie. You can just count down the months before he will return…We learn we can do without anything. And we become content with nothing. The more they take away from us year after year, the more family disappears, the more one doesn’t want to go home, doesn’t want a wife and a job and bills and an Amerikkan future…It is like waiting for the world to give us a reason to live. But the world just keeps giving us reasons to not give a shit.”This situation leads many inmates to report severe mental health problems that are aggravated by the long-term isolation. The prison routinely responds to such crises by placing suicidal inmates in a strip cell, where they are to be alone in a cell with  and checked every fifteen minutes. Included in many of these cells are cameras.L. writes that “if someone is gonna kill themselves they take them and out to a strip cell and you sleep on the hard floor and treated like a dog.”A. reports that “if I lose control because of something I have no control over, they’ll punish me and put me on strip cell for three days…when a mentally ill inmate feels suicidal, they send us to the infirmary to be on suicide watch…then we get from suicide watch back to Uinta 1 and the staff put us back in the strip cell when we get back to Uinta 1.”In Uinta 1, suicide is not an uncommon occurrence. In 2009, two prisoners in Uinta 1 committed suicide. One was Danny Gallegos, who was found hanged in his cell in June. Another was a friend of Green, Spencer “Spider” Hooper, a “Pink Floyd fan and singer on medications for schizophrenia and depression.” Months after a previous suicide attempt, Hooper was found dead in February 2009, hanging in his cell.A. and L. also independently confirm that sandbags at the cell doors of inmates gather bugs, which enter their cells. “They got sandbags around all the cells but never pick them up and clean under them so there’s all kinds of bugs and dirt that comes right under our doors,” A. writes.Green also writes about the declining array of services provided to Uinta 1 inmates. “Years ago indigent captives received five envelopes a week. Now its one. We had five outside contacts a week. Now one. We used to be fed enough to stay full. Now we are starved. We used to have shampoo and lotion. Now we don’t. We grumble for an hour each time something is taken from us. Then move right along to inventing the creative willpower to survive with no penpals and mail, a full stomach or clean hair. Moving right along. We expect tragedy.”Solitary Watch will continue to report on Uinta 1 as more information becomes available.Brandon Green welcomes letters.

From murderers where they kill another human(if they meant to do it I don’t feel to sorry for them as they are getting off easier then they should), judges, cops, lawyers, jailers to allow any human to be treated this way.ReplydesertmoonwomanOctober 26, 2012 at 2:27 pmI urge the non US citizens to contact their governments to put pressure on the US government to stop the inhumane treatment of our inmates. It is an embarrassment to our country and to little to late is being done to help with these conditions. Even if reforms were to happen tomorrow, the long term affects are there. I thank each and every person who reads these articles, the words are the seeds of change.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085October 24, 2012 at 2:11 pmI quote from this article:“This situation leads many inmates to report severe mental health problems that are aggravated by the long-term isolation.

Now we are starved.”According to the Washington Post article below Afghan’s with mental illness are chained to a concrete cell for 40 days with little food for treatment for their illness.The title of the article is:“At Afghan shrine, ancient treatment for mental illnessLegend has it that those with mental disorders will be healed after spending 40 days in one of the shrine’s 16 tiny concrete cells. They live on a subsistence diet of bread, water and black pepper…”http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/at-afghan-shrine-ancient-treatment-for-a-new-epidemic/2012/10/23/570ce338-187f-11e2-a346-f24efc680b8d_story.htmlMost Americans find such stories about Afghan culture to be proof they are a backward people but how much more progressive are we when we lock up our own mentally ill in solitary, not for 40 days but for decades?Which system is more backward?ReplySebastian CanadianOctober 24, 2012 at 12:14 pmI am a Canadian and I’m am not anti American . I love the American people but I must say they are a little to harsh with prisoners.The US government is quick to critisize other countries who have harsh conditions for prisoners but have neglected to look in there backyard.They critisize us the Canadians for being too lienent.ThanksAnd stay strong!ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
