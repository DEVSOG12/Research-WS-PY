The Department of Correctional Services Special Investigation Committee was established after the murders; the 62-page report also calls for reforms and the firing of several correctional officials.• New Jersey’s Star Ledger published an opinion piece entitled, “Research shows no good comes of prolonged solitary confinement.”• Federal prosecutors announced plans to join an ongoing lawsuit against New York City over the abusive treatment of adolescents on Rikers Island, including the overuse of solitary confinement. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York said, “While the United States had hoped to reach a speedy resolution with the city on these critical issues,”• Mayor Bill DeBlasio announced that Rikers Island will no longer hold juveniles in solitary confinement.• Just days before DeBlasio’s announcement, The New York Times published an Op-ed calling for an end to solitary confinement for juveniles. And the New York Advisory Committee on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights published a report entitled, “The Solitary Confinement of Youth in New York: A Civil Rights Violation.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Marshall Project,New Jersey,Nikko Jenkins,Rikers Island,Solitary ConfinementAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
