They were placed in solitary confinement following the 1972 murder of a prison guard, for which they were convicted on highly dubious evidence. They believe that they were targeted because they were members of the Black Panther Party–and that they remain in solitary today for the same reasons. (You can read our stories about the case on MotherJones.com, here, here, and here.)A new half-hour BBC radio program provides comprehensive and moving coverage of the case. It features Robert King–the third member of the Angola 3, who was released when his conviction was overturned after 29 years in solitary. It also includes interviews with lawyers, family members, activists–and Solitary Watch’s Jean Casella.You can listen to the full program here, and read the accompanying article here.You can also sign Amnesty International’s online petition demanding that Wallace and Woodfox be released from solitary confinement.We’ll be writing more about the Angola 3 next week.Herman Wallace’s sketch of the dimensions of his prison cellShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsAngola 3,BBC,Eighth Amendment,Louisiana,Louisiana State Penitentiary,Older Prisoners,Physical Effects,Politics of Punishment,Psychological Effects,Race,Retaliation,Solitary Confinement,TortureJames RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

The fact that these men(Angola 3) were put there and no one stood up for their constitutional rights opened the door to allow the government to isolate thousands indefinitely. Shame on America. Hopefully a stand for OUR rights as PEOPLE in this country no matter the color will see an end to this overused unconstitutional practice of torturing our countrymen.ReplyIya AdjuaApril 5, 2012 at 2:30 pmCruel isolation is 40 yrs in solitary confinement.Wallace & Woodfox should have been freed decades ago.I signed the petition & appreciate the information on their well-beings,ReplySis.
