We have already raised more than a thousand dollars to help us send cards, letters, and newsletters to nearly 500 people in prison–most of them in solitary confinement. With your help we’ve been able to send them holiday cards with a specially printed message: “Wishing you peace, strength, and hope this holiday season and throughout the coming year.” And we have begun to receive responses. Here’s just one example:“I can’t tell you how touched I am for you giving me any attention. I am so grateful to you and cried tears reading your card because the torture, abuse and neglect I’m facing makes this cell and my world a lonely place, and many days I think of how to take my own life and end the misery and pain but you inspire me and I continue to fight on.’’ –TexasIn order to keep up our correspondence throughout the year, we hope to raise $2,500 by January 15. For people in conditions of isolation and sensory deprivation–conditions known to cause anguish, madness, and even suicide–these communications can be a crucial lifeline, a connection to the outside world, and a reminder that they are not forgotten. Even $10 enables us to keep in touch with one person in solitary for a full year.
