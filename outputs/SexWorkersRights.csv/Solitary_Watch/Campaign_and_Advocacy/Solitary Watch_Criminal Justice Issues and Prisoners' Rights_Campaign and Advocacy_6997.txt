A new worst prison will be published each weekday (with some dishonorable mentions at the end), so please check in from time to time for new postings. What follows is the introduction to the series.“If you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime.” So goes the old saying. Yet conditions in some American facilities are so obscene that they amount to a form of extrajudicial punishment.Doing time is not supposed to include being raped by fellow prisoners or staff, beaten by guards for the slightest provocation, driven mad by long-term solitary confinement, or killed off by medical neglect. These, however, are the fates of thousands of prisoners every year—men, women, and children housed in lockups that give Gitmo and Abu Ghraib a run for their money.The United States boasts the world’s highest incarceration rate, with close to 2.3 million people locked away in some 1,800 prisons and 3,000 jails. Most are nasty places by design, aimed at punishment and exclusion rather than rehabilitation; while reliable numbers are hard to come by, at last count 81,622 prisoners were being held in some form of isolation in state and federal prisons.Thousands more are being held in solitary at jails, deportation facilities, and juvenile-detention centers. Nearly 1 in 10 prisoners is sexually victimized, by prison employees about half of the time—more than 200,000 such assaults take place in American penal facilities every year (PDF), according to estimates compiled under the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act. Suicides, meanwhile, account for almost a third of prisoner deaths, per the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while an unknown number of fatalities result from substandard nutrition and medical care.While there’s plenty of blame to go around, and while not all of the facilities described in this series have all of these problems, some stand out as particularly bad actors. We’ve compiled this subjective list of America’s 10 worst lockups (plus a handful of dishonorable mentions) based on three years of research, correspondence with prisoners, and interviews with reform advocates concerning the penal facilities with the grimmest claims to infamy. We will be rolling out profiles of the contenders over the next 10 days, complete with photos and video.Read the rest at MotherJones.com.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsADX,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Due Process,Immigrants,Juveniles,Physical Effects,Prison Health Care,Prison Health Care,prison rape,prisoner abuse,Psychological Effects,Sexual Assault,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,Supermax Prisons,ten worst prisons,TortureJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

In my opinion, there are very few beyond reform. In England, they have approx. 40 people in solitary..we have (well) over 80,000.ReplyJaneMay 3, 2013 at 7:31 amAlthough the United States is a generous and well-ordered nation in many ways, there can be a baffling punitive mentality that obstructs our efforts to treat each other humanely – not just in our criminal justice system, but generally. If we spent the energy and resources that we spend on extreme forms of punishment on building our communities, we wouldn’t have so many disaffected people turning to crime in the first place.ReplyC.O. nvictMay 2, 2013 at 5:24 pmKeep treating them like animals for years on end.Keep promising them parole then making it impossible to maintain. You are going to have to release most of them at some point.Damaged, mad, and so stigmatized they cant find a job to feed themsleves.Do be surprised when they Kill, or beat you damn near to death.Want to give them all life sentences, good, just move the decimal over on what you paid in taxes last year.ReplyFr. Russ CarmichaelMay 2, 2013 at 4:55 pmMy question is always; then what do you do with someone who is bent on killing others?We don’t want the death penalty? A life for a life? We don’t want solitary for the protection of others?For some reason we think we have the Right to place others in harm’s way so our conscience can say we do not torture.. Why should less offender be placed where there are combative, rapist? Seems to me we don not know what to do with bad guys…ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
