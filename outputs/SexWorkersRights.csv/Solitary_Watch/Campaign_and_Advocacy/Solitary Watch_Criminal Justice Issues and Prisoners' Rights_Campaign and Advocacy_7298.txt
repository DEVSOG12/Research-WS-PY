No conference on torture in America is complete without discussion of the growing problem of extra-judicial use of COINTELPRO on law-abiding Americans. All PSYOP is torture – first, when it’s inflicted, and then, when its victims are dismissed by community leaders as crazy. Now that local police are directed by the Pentagon, they have the legal capacity to use PSYOP tools as well as mind-altering technologies on citizens (and hire private gangs to use them), and even the Joint Forces stationed in every city in our country can use these tools and technologies, no organization purporting to protect human or civil rights in America should ignore these enslaving policies, practices and the LAWS that make their wipespread use possible.http://www.dontfearyourfreedom.blogspot.comReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
