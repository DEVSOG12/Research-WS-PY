The report, entitled “Still Buried Alive,” was published just as the state opened a 500-bed maximum-security facility.• The editorial board of New Jersey’s Star-Ledger called for substantial reform of the state’s solitary confinement practices, endorsing legislation proposed by State Senator Ray Lesniak earlier in the week.• A New Mexico man who’s spent the past seven years in “protective custody” isolation is suing the state in federal court, alleging he has suffered severe physical and emotional damage. The Sante Fe New Mexican published an op-ed in relation to the suit, which stated, “New Mexico is the second worst in the nation for the use of solitary confinement.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Arizona,death penalty,New Jersey,New Mexico,North Carolina,Palestine,Pennsylvania,Solitary Confinement,The Marshall ProjectAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
