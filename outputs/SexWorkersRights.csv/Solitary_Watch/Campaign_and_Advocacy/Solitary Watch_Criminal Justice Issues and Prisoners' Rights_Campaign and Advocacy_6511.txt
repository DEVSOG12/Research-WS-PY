In one recent letter, a man described to us how he had managed to survive nearly a decade in isolation in a 6×9-foot cell, quoting the iconic musician Bob Marley:“You never know how strong you are,” he wrote, “until being strong is the only choice you have.”In these dark and discouraging times, when hope can be difficult to hold onto and determination difficult to sustain, we are constantly inspired by these letters, which come from people who have been stripped of every comfort and support, and effectively banished from the human community—yet manage to reach out with stories about their lives, appeals for help, demands for justice, and gratitude for the simple knowledge that they have not been completely forgotten by the world outside their cells.Their fortitude in the face of brutal isolation and deprivation has helped us keep going for nine years, working to place this once invisible human rights issue firmly in the public consciousness and on the agendas of advocacy organizations, mainstream media, and policymakers.[su_button url=”https://www.newsmatch.org/organizations/solitary-watch” target=”blank” style=”flat” background=”#2ed992″ color=”#000000″ size=”10″ center=”yes” radius=”5″ icon_color=”#000000″ class=”font-family: Arial !important; font-size: 16px !important; font-weight: bold !important;”]Please help us continue this vital work[/su_button]The good news is that at last, real change has begun to happen.

Yet despite this progress, tens of thousands of people still remain locked in isolation for months, years, and decades.
