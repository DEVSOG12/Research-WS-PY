Referring to the 62 percent decrease in the number of people held in solitary in the state of Virginia since 2011, the story states “Those statistics are a testament to the viability of a solution to the many problems of solitary confinement…”• NOLA.com reports that Herman Wallace, who was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer earlier this year, has only a few more months to live. According to the story, Wallace “has about two months left to live, according to an update from Wallace released on Sept. 10.
