The strike ended three weeks after it began, with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation making a few small concessions to the prisoners’ demands, and promising to undertake a review of the policies under which inmates are placed and held in the state’s SHUs.Now, sources confirm that the organizers plan to resume their hunger strike to further push for reforms. In a letter published in the San Francisco Bay Guardian, Pelican Bay SHU inmate James Crawford, who goes by the name Mutope Duguma, reported that negotiations with the CDCR had left them “disappointed,” and “we are going forward with our indefinite hunger strike, which will start on Sept. 26, 2011.” Duguma continues: “We know they probably have manipulated some new attempt to deal with us, but what they fail to realize is that we were never playing. If these people think we are going to remain under this tortuous treatment, then they will get the body count that they seek or a bunch of hospitals filled up throughout the state.”Solitary Watch will provide more details on the resumption of the hunger strike as they become available.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCalifornia,California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,hunger strike,Pelican Bay,Solitary Confinement,Supermax PrisonsJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Credibility is an important tool in these matters.Although this may sound unreasonable, the rule is when someone is acting or talking like he is insane you gotta find the right wave length to communicate with him… Otherwise the only option left is to match their strength with the right attitude to create a win situation. Obviously that would be political suicide and really messy. Reforms can be made with no compromise to securing a safe and orderly prison environment but first, you gotta think about this. Arrangements have been made, and once the dominoes begin to fall, they must continue to fall as arrangements have been made to force the agency to clean up their act in the SHU mission creep. Now is the time to grasp the opportunity to change solitary confinement rules of engagement and resolve outstanding issues already on the table and likely to get more litigation as time goes by. One could make many issues a moot agenda if the SHU policies, procedures and housing assignment criteria / gang validation process are cleaned up before lawsuits pay out millions of dollars guaranteed to be in the bank the way the Supreme Court is ruling these daysCreating fear is a gamble.What is harder is to counter this claim of fear and make it into somethingthey even fear more…since they have already outlined a “body count.”ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
