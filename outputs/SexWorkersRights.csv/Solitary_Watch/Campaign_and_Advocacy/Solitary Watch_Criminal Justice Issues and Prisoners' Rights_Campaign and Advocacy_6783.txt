So that is a pretty significant ratio. I would want to see that number – a couple of years from now – I would hope to see that number at least halved, if not less,” he said.• The Vera Institute of Justice announced that it will work in collaboration with jails and prisons in five states with the aim of reducing the use of solitary confinement.  Nebraska, Oregon, and North Carolina, along with jails in New York City and Middlesex County, New Jersey, will engage in the two-year process.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Aakash Dalal,ADX Florence,Anthony Kennedy,Balitmore,juvenile detention,Nebraska,Solitary Confinement,vera institute of justiceAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
