Young people at the juvenile detention facility are held in solitary confinement for prolonged periods of time without human contact and without the ability to read, write, draw, or ask what time it is. The report calls for NORCOR to implement the 2016 recommendation by the Oregon State Court Juvenile Mental Health Task Force, which advised, “all child-serving systems commit to employing evidence-based, trauma-informed practices.” The report additionally called for all juvenile facilities, which currently face no government oversight, to be regulated in order to prevent the use of solitary confinement and ensure proper healthcare.• The New Yorker published the story of Jermaine Gotham, a boy who suffered several mental health concerns and learning disabilities, and was first placed in solitary confinement at Cayuga County Jail in Auburn, New York, when he was 16 years old. Gotham was later sent to Coxsackie Correctional Facility, where he spent another 300 days in solitary confinement, did not receive proper medication for his mental illnesses, and had to attend his G.E.D. classes in shackles. Gotham, still held in solitary at Coxsackie currently, recalled, “I’m not gonna lie, it never becomes easier. It messes with my mind. You become depressed, angry, aggressive. You think of killing yourself, though I would never tell anyone here that.” While New York State’s Commission on Correction issued new regulations for solitary confinement, including a mandate to notify the state when placing a juvenile in solitary, these standards will not go into effect for county jails until January, if approved.• Politically Georgia reported that fourteen individuals have committed suicide in Georgia prisons this year, surpassing the national average by nearly two times. Some point to staff shortages and a lack of mental health care in the state’s prison system as contributing factors to the rise in suicides. According to Sarah Geraghty of the Southern Center for Human Rights, “The increase in suicides may be related to the GDC’s [Georgia Department of Corrections] increased use of solitary confinement” as individuals kept in isolation are often “delusional and have lost touch with reality, conditions that are likely exacerbated by prolonged solitary confinement.”• According to Injustice Watch, 26-year-old transgender woman Strawberry Hampton, currently housed in the maximum security Menard Correctional Center for men in Illinois, has filed a motion seeking immediate transfer to a women’s facility, claiming that she has faced repeated sexual harassment, sexual assault, and physical abuse by Illinois Department of Corrections officers. Hampton was placed in solitary confinement in August, after she filed the complaint, and is set to remain in solitary until April 2018. Hampton recalls the guards’ words when she was transferred to Menard, “This is what happens when you f- with our staff.”• The Marshall Project published the story of a young man from Washington, D.C., who was convicted of carjacking at age 16 and sentenced as an adult to 12 years. Since D.C. does not have prisons of its own (only jails), the boy was sent to a Bureau of Prisons-contracted juvenile facility in Montana, where “[he] was the only black person, period. There were no black inmates, no black COs.” He ended up in solitary confinement after another person held there accused him of making threatening comments. “There was no questioning; I was immediately sent to the hole. I had no say in my defense, no chance to explain what truly went down.” At 18 he was transferred to adult prisons, where things only got worse. “I saw grown men commit suicide because they couldn’t handle it. If prison does that to an adult, what does it do to a child?”• VICE News reported that Pastor Lester Roloff’s Rebekah Home for Girls in Corpus Christi, Texas, allegedly used a legal loophole, which allowed religiously affiliated boarding schools to operate without registration or oversight, to enact abuses against the youth held in their facilities. One student recalled the “Get Right Room,” where children were held in solitary confinement and “brain-washed into thinking the abuse was good because the staff and the Lord loved your soul.” A recent law imposes new regulations on residential facilities, including those with religiously affiliations, though advocacy organizations continue to keep track of alleged abuses.• A man formerly held at Houston’s Harris County jail filed a $1 million lawsuit, claiming that guards beat him up and dislocated his shoulder and then threw him in solitary confinement in an attempt to cover up the assault. Mark Tennyson’s lawyer described to the Houston Chronicle how the incident began, when a staff member “came and rounded up a group of about six or eight African-American inmates. Mr. Tennyson was one of those inmates and he let her know it was discriminatory,” at which point the beating began. Tennyson’s lawsuit was filed days after 5 jailers were indicted for a separate 2016 beating of an individual held at Harris County.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,child abuse,D.C.,Georgia,health care,Illinois,Juveniles,lawsuit,mental health care,New York,Oregon,physical abuse,Psychological Effects,racial discrimination,racism,Retaliation,Sexual Assault,Suicide,Texas,transgender women,Washington,youthValerie KiebalaValerie Kiebala was a contributing writer and editorial and project manager for Solitary Watch, and is now the media director of Straight Ahead, which is building a decarceration movement throughout Pennsylvania.
