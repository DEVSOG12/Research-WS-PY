The facility houses approximately 450 men from across the country in solitary confinement units. The lawsuit alleges that inmates diagnosed with mental illnesses are denied constitutionally adequate mental health treatment. The severe sensory deprivation and restricted social contact at ADX is further alleged to exacerbate mental health problems. This concern was underscored in a June 2012 US Senate hearing on solitary confinement, when Director of the BOP, Charles Samuels, testified that there were only two psychiatrists on staff at ADX.One man in ADX, Jesse Wilson, wrote Solitary Watch after he listened to the head of the BOP testify that there weren’t mentally ill prisoners in ADX. “I heard the head of the BOP in Congress (on radio) saying they do not have insane inmates housed here, ” Wilson wrote, “This is what should be thought of as a lie. I have not slept in weeks due to these non-existing inmates beating on the walls and hollering all night.  And the most ‘non-insane’ smearing feces in their cells.”The lawsuit is currently pending before the US District Court. Currently titled Cunningham v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, a website tracking the progress of the lawsuit provides profiles of the plaintiffs.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in May that found federal officials hadn’t studied how long-term segregation affects those subject to it, how much it actually costs, or the extent to which it “achieves its stated purpose to protect inmates, staff and the general public.” A “snapshot estimate” provided by the BOP to the GAO  suggests that taxpayers are spending $78,000 per year, per person at ADX Florence to incarcerate them in psychologically devastating conditions.Solitary Watch has been in contact with several individuals in ADX Florence, including members of the lawsuit who wanted to tell more of their story and share their perspectives.Harold CunninghamHarold Cunningham, ADX Control Unit, 12 Years in SolitaryHarold Cunningham, 43, is the lead plaintiff of the federal lawsuit demanding constitutionally adequate mental health care in ADX. Cunningham is serving a life sentence and has been at the ADX Control Unit since 2001. Suffering from mental health issues since the age of ten, he has since been variously diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia, Psychotic Disorder NOS and Personality Disorder NOS, and has been incarcerated on and off since he was 11, including a five year prison sentence at the age of 17 for cocaine possession. Sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 for his involvement in a series of murders and robberies, he was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Marion until his transfer to ADX in 2001.While at Marion, he was at times held in solitary confinement. He complained of visual and auditory hallucinations and was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. According to the federal lawsuit, a psychologist at USP Marion found that “Cunningham’s current mental status, emotional expression, and behavior suggest significant mental health problems.” A year later he was transported to ADX, where psychiatric drugs are not provided to inmates.The lawsuit details that, as a consequence of the denial of psychiatric medication, his “behavior predictably worsened,” and he was cited for rules violations such as possessing weapons, assaulting corrections officers, and refusing to leave his cell. For this, he would spend five years, from 2002-2007 in even more restrictive environments within the Control Unit.His “treatment” has thus far consisted of workbooks and programs through his television. Cunningham wrote to Solitary Watch to tell more of his story:What I have been through at Marion and here in the ADX Control Unit has been a bloody nightmare. Mentally and physically.There was a bloody war going on in Marion when I arrived there, a place I should have never been sent to, I was designated to be housed at the Springfield Medical Facility. I have been taking psychotropic medication and receiving psychological therapy since the age of ten and on and off throughout my life. The war was racial, blacks against whites. The Aryan Brotherhood was warring with D.C. inmates.I’m from Washington, D.C. and I got caught in the middle but my problem was more with the racist correctional officers who were behind everything. It was a very dangerous environment, one wrong move and you could lose your life. I was lucky, it was like living in a concrete jungle and only the strong survive. But to survive you have to become an animal and I became a monster that one one dared to fuck with.I was sent from Marion to ADX Control Unit in 2001. I was treated and lived like an animal for years. Stripped of all my clothes for weeks at a time…just a blanket chained to my bed, water turned off, no shower at times. No food and when they did feed me it was bad food, stale bread and cheese, rotten apple…I was beaten while handcuffed. All this on and off throughout five to six years. It was an up and down roller coaster ride in a bloody nightmare. I was at war physically and mentally. I survived but now I suffer from PTSD so it’s hard for me to talk about some of the things I’ve been through. I’ve tried to block a lot of it out by escaping through writing. Every day in here is like a landmine field, one wrong step and I may snap back to that nightmare, something I don’t want to do.I have been seeking and reaching out for help, therapy and medication that I used to be on but that’s not allowed here in the control unit. This is what my lawsuit is all about. My attorney has been working real hard to help me get the treatment I need. I’ve been here 12 years, I have less than a year left. Hopefully they will send me somewhere I can get the help I need and get involved in programs like education and writing.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsADX Florence,Bacote v.

He killed 8 people in cold blood in the early 90’s and stabbed his ex-girlfriend who was testifying against him as a whiteness in the court room. He was acting as his own attorney, hid a 5 inch prison made shank in his wheel chair and tried to kill her in the middle of the court room. Oh, he lost a few toes when he was shot in the foot in a gun fight with police during his arrest but can walk just fine (with a limp).This man deserves to be on death row.ReplyJohn VondraJune 5, 2017 at 7:23 pmInhuman–stop it..ReplyFredJanuary 9, 2017 at 9:05 amThe savages are not in ADX because they stole a candy bar from 7 11.If the conditions there are so awful, bullets to the head will put then out of their misery!ReplyJoe GonzalesOctober 19, 2016 at 1:49 amThis is for the name lame that says only dumb fucks are sent to supermax because they don’t know the system.

I have personally told many gangbangers to stop sniveling like bitches, both on the street and in every prison they sent me too. If you really knew what time it was PUNK you wouldn’t shoot your mouth off to someone that won’t hesitate to shut it. On the street or in the joint real men don’t snivel and the ones that do are either in Protective custody or headed there. The only thing you convey to everyone who reads your message PUNK is that you are afraid of gangbangers. Maybe you would be afraid to call them a sniveling bitch, but don’t think everyone is a spineless bitch like you. I invite you to leave your computer and come discuss the issue with me personally. Yeah that’s a challenge PUNK now you can show us all what you got and if not take your coward ass to another forum. PUNKReplyjackmeyhofferMay 20, 2016 at 5:16 pmAre we supposed to feel sorry for these criminals?I don’t.There’s a REALLY easy way to not wind up in prison- behave yourself.I (and pretty much everyone I’ve ever known) have managed to do so since birth.Not that difficult.If you don’t behave yourself you only have yourself to blame.Rot in prison.It will keep you from hurting other people.ReplyJFKJRApril 18, 2016 at 10:10 pmWaste of time and money. Execute this trash.ReplyTrump SupporterNovember 12, 2015 at 3:23 ami DO NOT believe in long term solitary confinement.It absolutely causes mental health issues which in turn causes more problems for the guards and also becomes a major major security issue for the guards. For someone with a preexisting confirmed mental condition to be sent here will make it much worse since they can’t take psych medications at this facility. I honestly can’t believe we even have a prison that is 100 percent solitary confinement for all inmates.My husband is a policeman and I am not a do-gooder who believes in lame punishment for evil crimes.I believe in punishment and I also believe in solitary confinement when it is warranted but not for years at a time.This is American and our prison systems need to be humane if we are going to send prisoners there, regardless of their crime.A chained dog becomes vicious. There is more to think about than just chaining people up or confining them for years in solitary with no regard for the mental health of the individual.ReplyBite MeAugust 24, 2015 at 11:03 amGive him a little nerve gas that will calm him down……………ReplyjackmeyhofferMay 22, 2015 at 9:28 pmThe accommodations aren’t to their liking?Oh well.Next time, don’t break the law.ReplyMattyBlack88December 14, 2017 at 12:13 amsome of you are hilarious.I love this one, “Don’t Break the Law.”Do you know how many felonies ordinary citizens committ each and every day.Because the laws in this country are not as straightforward as people would have you believe.Next time your mother gets an abcess in her tooth, and just until she can get to the dentist you give her a Vicodin for the pain.There is your first punishable felony for that day anyway.Replymb5599May 20, 2015 at 7:07 amgive them the option of being put down like the animals they are. they deserve no sympathy. they have killed, raped, robbed, etc.members of this society, now they complain that they are being mistreated?? they are getting better than they gave their victims.let them rot.ReplyLyd for justice!March 6, 2015 at 4:38 pmWhere’s the part two.. Good read though it’s sad that prisons have crappy mental health funding..Replymina cathebDecember 28, 2014 at 9:33 pmDo they ever explain that can’t get along with each other either – now is the BOP suppose to make them better people so they won’t stab or hurt other prisoners for a variety of reasons when out of their cells. This goes on the lower security levels all the time, I can only imagine what would happen with many of these violent murders who are serving LWP or some long sentence, knowing they nothing to loose. What do they expect from the BOP?ReplyMARTIN MCNALLYSeptember 29, 2014 at 4:49 pmSOME OF THIS STUFF IS— FUNNY…. THE FACT IS—-SOME OF THESE DUDES HAVE— NOTHING COMING —WITH 37 YEARS IN THE FEDS I KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT..A LOT OF INMATES WERE JUSTIFIABLY DEALT WITH —CONVICT JUSTICE—…DO THE CRIME— DO THE TIME…. PRISON IS NOT EASY..ReplyJoeSeptember 29, 2014 at 10:15 pmI would just like to convey that Martin has an honest and realistic opinion of what is really going on in these prisons. I suggest that some of you liberals research some cases of some of these crying ass inmates. Some of you write in support if these inmate with out having any idea why they are where they are. As you can see these inmates posting their “BAD TREATMENT” never write what they are there for. Let’s face it, most of our level 3 and 4 institutions are designed and structured for punishment not rehabilitation.By the time these inmates reach the level they are in, you can pretty much be assured that they have committed multiple felonies. Of course they want better accommodations, better treatment, better food so their experience in prison can be a comfortable one. Now why would anyone defend or support a person that is in prison for killing a little 4 year old child by shoving her into a bathtub of scalding water. How about the guy that sodomized a 2 year old baby, or the gangster that opened fire on a house killing an elderly lady of 75 and a 5 year old child. Should I go on, it really is frustrating to know and read postings and comments from citizens that support these criminals and advocate for prison reform and better treatment. I hope it never happens that one of you liberals have to experience such a heinous crime on one of your loved ones. I am sure you will not continue to advocate for them but probably against them. For the most part I believe that a large percentage of inmates that are in prison deserve to be exactly where they are but of course they will never admit it. They are just trying to manipulate you people into assisting them obtain better conditions. They have nothing to lose. I feel confident that once they get out they would probably rob and rape and burglarize your homes and families without hesitation. What would you say then ?ReplyEternalDamnationApril 6, 2015 at 7:45 pmI would not debate for one second that these inmates are some of the most horrific scumbags on the planet and deserve anything they get. But that does not mean to say that the people running these prisons and are not a bunch of f***g psychopaths. Cockroaches enjoy consuming feces.ReplyGreg B.May 2, 2014 at 3:26 pmDick, and JoeI agree with both of you guys on multiple points. Most of these jerks were tough guys on the street who wouldn’t think twice about committing a horrible crime and not give it a second thought . When caught they act like little bitches because the justice system doesn’t serve them steak an eggs for breakfast. I say three years on appeal then the chair or the needle.ReplyJoe GonzalezMay 2, 2014 at 7:13 pmHelloI am glad to see that there are still some righteous citizens that can recognize manipulating scumbags. Let me mention that a high percentage of these gangsters that did their dirt to get locked up are now in protective custody, sensitive needs or what ever else they want to call those weak sissy yards they run too for protection. I challenge any of these sniveling punk inmates crying for better accommodations and treatment to write in detail the crimes they committed to get where they are today. Share those stories with usTell us how you carjacked some poor innocent lady, how you sold drugs to kids, how you did that drive by and killed an innocent child, how you home invaded some nice family and terrorized them while you were stealing their propertyor how about molesting children or assaulting helpless women.

They cry about good treatment now but they didn’t care how they treated their victims.ReplyDawud BlairFebruary 15, 2016 at 8:24 amPlz ppl….dnt get it twisted, it’s really innocent ppl there being punished for crimes they did not commit.If the tables turned today and u go to prison, would u like to get treated like this? That shit would drive you insane.Then with no outside communication would brake 85% of u ppl. Of course make them pay for their crime(s), but it’s rules and criterias of how this is done.So be careful of what u say….because the shoe could be on the other foot.Would u want ure ppl or ureself treated like that?I really dnt think so.Think b4 we be harsh to others.These inmates are very strong to deal with treatment like this everyday, most of u ppl would’ve killed ureselves or needed med,s also.The stuff in the world bothers most of us…so just imagine what these ppl goes through on a daily basis.ReplyGlenn Eric JohnsonFebruary 18, 2016 at 1:02 pmmost people in prison are guilty as hell, especially the ones in ADX, no man is at adx for being a model convict, most of those people are beyond rehabilitation once they are deemed that much of a security threat.ReplyMattyBlack88December 14, 2017 at 12:15 amChump huh.You would not survive one hour in that place Dick.ReplyDonSuperiorApril 16, 2014 at 3:14 amJoe gonzalez is clear your all for inhumane treatment but maybe if you had a dad or brother going thru 23 hour lock down you would feel bad but clearly joes family are the victims and corrections officers thats the team he cares about but ill tell you what joe gonzalez i hope your family dont ever make any mistakes because clearly you wouldnt care you probaly would send no money and never go visit them and then try to justify it to yourself saying they shouldnt have been human…ms williamis right its not working we need prison reform… start by letting inmates pay for their own stay. But this is only posible if the prison industrial complex stops their legal 30cent an hour slavery because its not ok to exploit humans no matter what… i understand some inmates are evil but we are just as evil by making them worst setting them up for failure…we all know theirs no profit for the prison if we persevereReplyJoe GonzalezApril 16, 2014 at 8:15 amDon it gives me great satisfaction to advise you of how ignorant your statement sounds. First only a complete moron would believe that our system doesn’t need improvement.Second what is clear is that you have no experience in researching the criminal mind. I would assume that if members of your family were victimized by being carjacked, robbed, raped or murdered you would sympathized and want the criminals to be treated like celebrities. Give them a 3 star living arrangement and pamper them so when they are released they will be upstanding citizens. A large percentage of these criminals in solitary have committed multiple offenses in society and in prison. They didn’t reach that level by missing Sunday church. If any of my friends or relatives decide to commit these horrible offenses then I don’t feel sorry for them. I have met many offenders of diverse backgrounds and ages and unfortunately there are some very disturbed violent predators that if released they will only continue to victimize innocent people. The only thing that is clear in your statement is that you have no idea what you are writing about. Do a little research so your statements may have some validity.ReplyDICKApril 12, 2014 at 11:52 amI’m glad that fu**nut is put away (Robert Phillip hansen)Replyryan hApril 2, 2014 at 2:33 amPoor guy I feel bad for him.

Every city has them.Some people like crime, they enjoy hurting people, they don’t have any respect or consideration for other people. They are termed SOCIOPATHS or PSYCHOPATHS. Would you like one as your neighbor. Why don’t you go visit a few and see which one you want to marry your daughter.Let’s cut the crap lady and call it what it is, PUNISHMENT. We all know what is probably going to happens when we sell drugs or carjack, home invade, rob, rape and murder. We are probably going to prison. So yes I say DEAL WITH IT now like the big bad guys you were out here. You had your chance probably a few of them and now you are there. Prison isn’t suppose to be nice. Just be grateful you are not treated daily like you treated your victims. That will come later when you get to hell.ReplyGerryMarch 24, 2014 at 5:51 pmRecidivism? Rehabilitation doesn’t not happen in prison. The thugs either open their eyes or get tired of the thug life. The ones that don’t return are either killed outside, find Jesus and or continue their criminal enterprise. They do not care one iota about the people they have killed or harmed, it is all about the power and the money. Prison is a deterent, as long as you keep them locked up.ReplyJoe GonzalezMarch 24, 2014 at 7:02 pmHello GerryI do not see an argument with any thing you stated. I really don’t even understand what the issue is here. These prisoners would kiss the inside of their solitary confinement cells and write letters of appreciation to the BOP if they were sent to a middle Eastern country and witnessed the conditions of those institutions and the penalties for their crimes. I could not understand a coalition to save a California condemned female inmate that murdered a 4 year old girl by forcing her into a bathtub of scalding water. Sometimes I am not sure if we have all the sick people locked up. Yes let’s let her out and hire her as our daycare provider.ReplycbacaFebruary 25, 2014 at 4:05 amI find Mr Cunningham argument well thought out, intelligent, lucid and rational – and this is without medication? Hahaha interesting.ReplyShanna ShillingMarch 11, 2016 at 12:37 pmYou can be intelligent, well thought, and rational and STILL have a mental illness. They are not mutually exclusive. Cognition and the presentation of mood disorder or thought disorder are not the same.ReplySusan WilliamsJanuary 21, 2014 at 7:52 pmSo locking people up and treating them like crap is an answer. JUdging by the recidivism rate when people EOS form a Supermax prison (60%), it is not, and then there is the little problem of inmates housed in these close managment facilities cost more, andthen there is the fact that many of these inmates are mentally ill and were mentally ill when they came to prison. I really don’t think that “deal with it” is an answer that addresses the problem.ReplyJoe GonzalezJanuary 21, 2014 at 9:16 pmHelloI do not think we are focusing our attention in the right area. I believe that the prisoners we are referring to have committed mulitply crimes and have made their choices. Their not kids if people make the choice to be anti social criminals and murderers then they can’t expect to be treated like Medal of Honor recepients.ReplyShanna ShillingMarch 11, 2016 at 12:54 pmTo inform – persons do not choose to be Antisocial…These Personality Disorders are largely the result of traumatic childhoods – children and people who have been abused and treated poorly. Some, so inhumanely you could not imagine. Socrates said, “To know the good is to do the good.” Doing good is a kind of knowledge and the absence of this knowledge is ignorance. Evil is ignorance. And it is bred!! (There is, incidentally, A LOT of ignorance in this comment thread!)To ask our corrections system to rehabilitate these folks- to make every effort to do so and to promote humane conditions in the facilities is the least we can ask and expect. Our society is reflective of the choices we make within such systems and this article shows how so – we are breeding individuals who are not capable of functioning on a community level. We are perptuating and exacerbating the problem.Replymb5599May 20, 2015 at 7:11 amhow bout putting them ina half way house on your street?? love how people advocate for all of these things, yet will cry and wail if it is in “their back yard”.ReplyDawud BlairFebruary 15, 2016 at 8:14 amUre right Susan.I’ve been in high max USP Hazelton for ten yrs. I understand we have to pay for the crime we committed, but what about the ones who suffers from mental health from a child to adulthood? Some are not responsible for their actions, and the guards that’s sworn in to protect these inmates….are the same ppl doing them wrong. It’s still a criteria and rules you have to abide by as an deputy, officer or sheriff or what have you.Let’s say it’s one if you guys there….no matter the crime you committed, would you want to be treated like that?Denied medical, outside communication, mental med’s, food and so on.Sounds to me their running a concentration camp.ReplyGlenn Eric JohnsonFebruary 18, 2016 at 1:04 pm“some are not responsible for their actions” yet victims still suffer horrible fates, and families still grieve, would you want your mama living near these folks?ReplyDawud BlairFebruary 18, 2016 at 1:42 pmShe lives near these folks everyday….some just have more control than others.What about the ones that can’t controll their mental health, the ones that has been diagnosed as children with their illness??Dnt be so insensitive, at least a mental facility would be acceptable.Somewhere where their problems would be addressed appropriately.ReplyGlenn Eric JohnsonAugust 4, 2016 at 7:30 pmI agree that they should be in a mental facility.ReplyJoe GonzalezJanuary 21, 2014 at 4:55 amMy opinion is simple. To the individuals complaining of their conditions and treatment. Stop your sniveling, be the tough gangsters and criminals you were when you were free. You didn’t have any sympathy for your victims, some of which are dead. You knew where you were headed and didn’t care. You weren’t crying for medication and therapy when you were taking drugs so quit your damn crying now and deal with it. Be the big bad gangsters you were out here and stop acting like bitches now.

I have not slept in weeks due to these non-existing inmates beating on the walls and hollering all night.And the most ‘non-insane’ smearing feces in their cells.”“A “snapshot estimate” provided by the BOP to the GAOsuggests that taxpayers are spending $78,000 per year, per person at ADX Florence to incarcerate them in psychologically devastating conditions.”I ask what has changed since Eastern State Penitentiary (ESP) opened up in 1829. At the time it was the largest and most expensive public structure in the country and the elite opinion in the U.S. was firmly behind the idea of solitary confinement.Then as now, the major concern was whether the system at ESP was cost effective.Then as now, the arrogance of the system can be heard in the annual report of 1869, which lists the arguments against the solitary system, refutes them, and concludes, “We are justified in unequivocally asserting that the Pennsylvania system of penitentiary discipline understood and properly applied, is not injurious to the health, has no injurious influence on the mind, is neither inhuman nor cruel … and that if properly administered, it is now the most philosophic and effective system for the treatment of crime as an actual condition of persons in all societies.”Despite this vehement defense of the solitary system, in the period after the Civil War, the regimen at Eastern State was slowly abandoned. Historians have theorized that the rise in foreign immigrants among the prison population decreased public sympathy for prisoners and made expensive penal reform less politically popular during the postwar period.Have you noticed how many comments your last article on immigrates received?I clicked on the profile link but I found that all the profiles of the inmates from Washington, D.C. and the one man from Saipan are lacking the specifics of the crimes that they were originally sentenced for. Not that it matters but I did find it odd becauseall the other offender’s profiles specifically stated their crimes and documented their previous history of mental illness.Four were convicted for robbery and two for threatening the President.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
