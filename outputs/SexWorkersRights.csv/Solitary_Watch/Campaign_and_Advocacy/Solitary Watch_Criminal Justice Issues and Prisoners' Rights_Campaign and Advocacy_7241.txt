Under Lappin, the BOP continued to grow, adding new prisons and prisoners at a rate even higher than that of the states, according to analyses by the Sentencing Project and the Pew Center on the States.  Since 1995 alone, the number of federal inmates has more than doubled, to over 211,000. More than half of these prisoners are serving time on drug charges, and another 10 percent are held on immigration violations. In all, more than 72 percent are nonviolent offenders with no history of violence, and 34 percent are first-time nonviolent offenders.Yet, as we wrote recently, the BOP’s FY 2012 budget request includes funds to open new maximum security prisons in Alabama and New Hampshire, and to acquire and renovate a new supermax prison in Thomson, Illinois, which would add and add up to 1,600 solitary confinement cells. It is in response to such plans that the consortium of groups is urging Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a reformer who will take the BOP in a different direction. According to an announcement issued by the 24 groups:Two dozen more organizations have called on Attorney General Eric Holder to name a reformer to head the federal Bureau of Prisons. The position is vacant with the retirement of Harley Lappin. In a letter to Holder, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, NAACP, and Sentencing Project urged the appointment of “an  individual with experience in systems reform and change. She or he must also have the courage and commitment to lower recidivism rates, improve conditions in BOP facilities, focus on rehabilitation and re-entry, and improve public safety through reforms in correctional practice and strategy.”The groups said that currently, the prison bureau “functions at nearly 140%  capacity where prisoners are warehoused, rather than rehabilitated, and both staff and prisoners are routinely put at risk due to dangerous conditions. Unfortunately, the agency has not adapted its management strategy to take full advantage of the diverse population reduction authorities and cost-savings measures given to it by Congress, such as: expanded half-way house placement, compassionate release, and sentence reduction programs like good time and drug program participation. The consequence of this inaction is that the BOP has grown more bloated and more dangerous over time.” The American Bar Association, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and Human Rights Watch made similarpoints to Holder in recent letters.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsBureau of Prisons,Cost/Budget Issues,Eric Holder,Federal Prisons,Harley Lappin,Politics of Punishment,Sentencing,Solitary Confinement,Supermax PrisonsJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

We got rid of all our other industries and now we use our own people to make money. Some towns would not exist w/o a prison. Use isolation indescriminately..costs more. Isnt making money from keeping people in chains Slavery? Generate public hysteria keeping the myth of murders rapists alive. They the COs instigate violence to justify pay hikes. It’s Madness.I know a man that has been parole ready for 20 years and denied every time randon stupid reasons just recently denied again and lots other aging men the as a budget strategy take their meds away. you can click my website. I can not stress enough for people to wake up. these men parole ready are old and no threat yet they keep em they are no trouble the young violent go in and out because “they” dont want to deal w/ them, sickening travestyReplyDave SeavyMay 31, 2011 at 3:45 amHere’s what’s happened over the years:Politicians, in order to appear to actually give a damn about citizens, hype up crime such as murder, sex offenses, drug dealing, etc., and scare the daylights out of the average American.But they have a remedy, and it will keep America safe.They are no better than talk show hosts who go nuts on any “hot topic” and ride it straight in to the ground.The public at large believes this nonsense, and breathes a sigh of relief, figuring we’re safe thanks to the war on drugs and war on crime.Taxpayers are being fleeced by the astronomical cost of prisons, and prisons have become big business – probably bigger than WalMart.Yes, the DOJ and BOP needs a complete house cleaning, as well as all the politicians.It’s gone way too far, and unless new leadership is put in place, we’re going to read about more abuse.ReplyTomisinaMay 26, 2011 at 9:55 pmI agree Janet yet elected officials keep the myth of murderers and rapists are in prison when its not what makes up the prison population.
