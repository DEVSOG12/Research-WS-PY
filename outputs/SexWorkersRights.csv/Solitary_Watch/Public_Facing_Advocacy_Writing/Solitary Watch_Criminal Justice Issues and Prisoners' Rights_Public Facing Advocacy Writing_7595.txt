Another suffers from mental illness and is routinely placed in isolation instead of receiving the treatment he needs. Another has been “validated” as a gang member, and is in his twelfth year of solitary confinement at Pelican Bay.Together, they offer a sense of how solitary confinement–even more than other forms of incarceration–tears families apart and keeps prisoners separated from what is often one of the only positive forces in their lives–their mothers.Check out the Justice Mamas page here, and the ACLU’s Stop Solitary project here.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsACLU,Juveniles,Mental Illness,Mother's Day,Physical Effects,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Supermax PrisonsJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Never under estimate the power of a mother’s prayer and devotion. My mom prayed so hard for me while I was locked up, that I became a writer. Now out of prison, I have 7 books on Amazon and am able to write many prisoners with hope. Please keep sending me your son’s addresses, as it is a joy to write them. I remember what my 10 plus years was like in prison, lonely.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085May 12, 2012 at 1:59 pmhttp://bit.ly/KcwIqDFinally a link that should work.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085May 12, 2012 at 11:51 amThe image is number 13 of 65.

He had been repeatedly brutalized in solitary for over a decade before he died in solitary at Salinas Valley prison. His body was cremated without our knowledge and tossed into the ocean. Thankfully although our mother warned it would happen she died without ever learning the truth. I like to think Victor came to her on her death bed and the two will be forever together.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
