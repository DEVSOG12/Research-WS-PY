The channel will feature original video interviews with former prisoners, family members, and advocates, as well as a collection of other videos on solitary confinement. We begin with three short video interviews  shot by Valeria Monfrini, a student at Corcoran College of Art + Design who is completing an internship as a reporter and videographer at Solitary Watch.•Bonnie Kerness, whose wealth of hands-on involvement with prisoners held in solitary has inspired and informed so much of the movement against prison isolation, comes out of the civil rights movement. As she describes it, “Since 1975, I have been a human rights  advocate on behalf of prisoners throughout the country. Currently, I coordinate the Prison Watch Project for the American Friends Service Committee  (AFSC).” Kerness works out of the AFSC office in Newark, and on a June day this year, she shared her own analysis before  introducing us to two people who experienced solitary confinement firsthand.[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V_q5UG5qbU]•Munirah El-Bomani spent time in New Jersey women’s prisons in the late 1990s. She landed in solitary, she says, because she stood up for herself and was branded a troublemaker. Today she fights for a living as a street vendor and civil rights activist in Newark. More than a decade after her release, she remains haunted by her prison experiences, and by the fear of going back.[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jut8hLl0ZVk]•Ojore Lutalo was imprisoned in 1982 on an armed robbery conviction, and released in 2009. He spent the majority of his 26 years behind bars in isolation because of his associations with the Anarchist Black Cross Federation and Black Liberation Army. For much of this time, he was in the Management Control Unit at Trenton State Prison. The MCU, one of the earliest units of its kind, was known for using solitary confinement to isolate prisoners who held unsavory political beliefs or sought to organize other inmates. Here Lutalo describes his time in solitary, including an incident in 2005, when he was summarily thrown into what the prisoners call the “boom-boom room”—formally referred to as mental health unit 1-C, where “I was not allowed to shower, change my clothing, have soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, washcloth or towel. I was not allowed to make telephone calls, send out or receive personal or legal mail. I was also not allowed to receive personal or legal visits or take part in any inside or outside recreational activities.” Lutalo also guides viewers through his artwork, which he says helped him remain sane and strong while inside.[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljB00Jg-n6M]ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsAmerican Friends Service Committee,Bonnie Kerness,Corrections Industry,Human Rights,Media,Munirah El-Bomani,New Jersey,Ojore Lutalo,Political Prisoners,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Solitary Watch,Supermax Prisons,Torture,videos,YouTubeJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

It is virtually impossible for journalists to interview anyone in solitary, much less film them. All we can do is interview those fortunate enough to be out in the free world.ReplyJoshlynAugust 16, 2011 at 8:41 pmoh ya i may be in ny but i worth the trip ben study solitary be for i was a adult trust me when i say you can find anything on the web but how to treat shu sindrumand yes i a good frend of the man who coined the term grassian help me understand the effefts i met him i hope to be like him grate men are wothy of following and grassian is more then worthy of this and more i know he be glad if you had me on your show DR.
