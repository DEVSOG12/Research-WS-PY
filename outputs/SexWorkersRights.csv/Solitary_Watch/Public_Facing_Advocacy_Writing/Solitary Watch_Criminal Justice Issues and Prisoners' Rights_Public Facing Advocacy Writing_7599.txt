He says as much in the interview.Therefore besides the humanitarian aspect it seems his release from solitary could be a moderating force in the General Population of the prison that he is held in.ReplyJeffrey DunmoreFebruary 11, 2012 at 5:23 pmAnd that is exactly why they are resistant to the condition of placing him in population,we may see an excellent opportunity to have a multitude of minds healthily effected and lives saved also. yet even i can recognize The Power. And thats their fear,not to mention the fact that …The System is in the business of WAREHOUSING….NOT REHABILITATION. personally i will be looking forany publications the brother may write.we can all become outlets for the vast knowlegde this brother has by communicating with him.ReplyinamansheartFebruary 10, 2012 at 11:19 pmMy God, i was just a boy when this brother took me under his wing. somewhere in the middle 70’s i was locked down @Huntingdon, Somethings occurred that would make for a very memorable experience. it was there i learned just how afraid so manycould become so Afraid of one. i am 59 yyrs. of age now. i will reach out to Maroon,though he will not remember me. i will reach out,i have not been inside those walls ;going on 30 years.#1042,#2326#2993#7307Thereis not much that came with each of those numbers that i’ve forgotten. that was last time i would see Maroon. yes!!i shall reach out to him.ReplyHafidha SaadiqahFebruary 10, 2012 at 8:46 pmMercy!Praying that one day this year he will be released.Soon.Peace,blessings, and strength to you and your family.ReplyTracieTXFebruary 10, 2012 at 8:32 pmHow can anyone not be outraged by such inhuman treatment.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
