The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Oregon, seeks $30 million in damages and injunctions against similar mistreatment of American citizens.Read the entire lawsuit.Last year, CAIR called on the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division to investigate Fikre's claims that he was beaten on the soles of his feet, kicked and punched, and held in stress positions while interrogators shouted questions similar to those posed to him by FBI agents and other American officials.Video: CAIR Interview with Yonas FikreFikre said he rejected an FBI demand that he act as an informant.
