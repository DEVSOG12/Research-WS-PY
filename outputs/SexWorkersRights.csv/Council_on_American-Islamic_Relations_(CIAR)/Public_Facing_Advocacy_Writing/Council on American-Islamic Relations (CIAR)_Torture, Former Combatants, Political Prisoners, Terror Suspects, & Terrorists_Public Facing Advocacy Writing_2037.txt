Lauren Boebert After She Doubles Down, Accuses Rep. Omar of ‘Sympathizing with Terrorists’Ismail AllisonNovember 29, 20214:52 pm(WASHINGTON, D.C., 11/29/21) – The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, is calling on Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer to censure Rep. Lauren Boebert after the Colorado congresswoman accused Rep. Ilhan Omar of being un-American and sympathizing with terrorists following a belligerent phone call with Rep. Omar in which Boebert refused to publicly apologize for her earlier anti-Muslim remarks.In a statement CAIR Director of Government Affairs Robert McCaw said:“Enough is enough. Accusing one of the first American Muslim women elected to Congress of being un-American and sympathizing with terrorists is a disgusting new low for Rep. Boebert.“Republican leaders of Congress, starting Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, must condemn this bigotry and demand that Rep. Boebert immediately, clearly and publicly apologize.”“If she once again refuses to do so, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer should move to censure her. Failing to do so would signal that Islamophobia is an acceptable form of bigotry in the halls of Congress.”SEE: Ilhan Omar Hangs Up on Lauren Boebert Over Non-Apology For ‘Jihad Squad’ Remarkshttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-lauren-boebert_n_61a53d68e4b025be1aed585fRep. Omar reports during a one-on-one call with Boebert, “Instead of apologizing for her Islamophobic comments and fabricated lies” Boebert “refused to publicly acknowledge her hurtful and dangerous comments.” After the call, Rep. Boebert suggested Omar sympathizes with terrorists.So far, Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA) and other Republican leaders have failed to repudiate Boebert for her Thanksgiving break smear and anti-Muslim attack targeting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and for misusing Islamic terminology.NOTE: Earlier today CAIR issued a press release condemning Republic House leadership’s continued silence over Rep. Boebert’s attack on Rep. Omar, and called on Boebert to “clearly and publicly” apologize.Rep. Boebert’s Thanksgiving Break Smear on Rep OmarOn Thursday a video surfaced showing Boebert meeting with constituents over the Thanksgiving Break, apparently telling false story about being in a Capitol elevator with Rep. Omar, when a Capitol police officer reportedly approached and expressed alarm.“Well, she doesn’t have a backpack. We should be fine,” Boebert claimed to have said, an allusion to the Islamophobic smear that all Muslims are terrorists. Boebert also called Omar a member of the “jihad squad.”CAIR immediately called on Republican leaders to condemn her remarks. Rep. Omar says the incident never happened and that Boebert seems too frightened to look her in the eye.Rep. Boebert’s Has a History of Attacking Congresswoman OmarThis is not the first time Rep. Boebert has engaged in anti-Muslim bigotry. On the Joe Pags Show, Boebert referred to Congresswoman Omar as a “propagandist for Hamas” and suggested she had a suicide belt strapped to her body.WATCH VIDEO: Rep. Boebert Attacks Rep. Omar on Joe Page ShowOn November 17, Boebert engaged in another anti-Muslim “jihad squad” attack targeting Rep. Omar, in a tirade attacking Democrats during a congressional debate over censuring Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) for releasing an animated cartoon where he kills Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and attacks President Joe Biden.CAIR’s mission is to protect civil rights, enhance understanding of Islam, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.La misión de CAIR es proteger las libertades civiles, mejorar la comprensión del Islam, promover la justicia, y empoderar a los musulmanes en los Estados Unidos.Become a Fan of CAIR on Facebookhttp://www.facebook.com/CAIRNationalSubscribe to CAIR’s Email Listhttps://action.cair.com/a/newslettersSubscribe to CAIR’s Twitter Feedhttp://twitter.com/cairnationalSubscribe to CAIR’s YouTube Channelhttp://www.youtube.com/cairtvFollow CAIR on Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/cair_national/Donate to CAIRhttps://action.cair.com/a/donateDo you like reading CAIR press releases and taking part in our action alerts?
