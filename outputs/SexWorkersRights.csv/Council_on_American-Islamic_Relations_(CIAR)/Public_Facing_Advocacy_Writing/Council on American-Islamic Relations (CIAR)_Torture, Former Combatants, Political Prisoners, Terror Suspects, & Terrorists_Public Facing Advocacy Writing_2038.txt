These homes would be in addition to the more than 2,000 segregated Israeli settler-only homes announced in August. [*Like in segregated housing in apartheid-era South Africa, the homes would not be available to those who are native to the land.]SEE: Israel to build over new 1,300 W. Bank settler homesCAIR also called on President Biden to condemn Israel’s recent attack on Palestinian human rights groups by designating them as “terrorist institutions.”As reported on the news and opinion about Palestine website Mondoweiss, “the designation ‘effectively outlaws’ the activities of these civil society groups, and allows Israeli authorities to take a number of measures against them, including closing down their offices, seizing their assets, and arresting and jailing staff members” and “criminalizes the funding or public expression of support for the organizations and their activities.”SEE: Israel labels leading Palestinian human rights groups ‘terrorist institutions’While the Biden administration has previously said it opposes unilateral Israeli settlement construction on occupied Palestinian land – and such projects being illegal under international law – the White House has failed to publicly challenge the Israeli government over its continued expansion of segregated settler housing projects and expulsion of dozens of Palestinian families in Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah and elsewhere.SEE: Israel’s Top Court Holds Decisive Hearing on Eviction of Palestinian Family in East JerusalemOn Friday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that the U.S. was concerned about Israel’s planned expansion of settlements, “We are concerned about the announcement of a meeting next week to advance settlement units deep in the West Bank, and believe it is critical for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to refrain from unilateral steps that exacerbate tension and undercut efforts to advance a negotiated two-state solution.”SEE: Department of State Press Briefing, Oct. 22, 2021In a statement, CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said:“American Muslims – and all others concerned about justice and international law – call on President Biden to publicly challenge the Israeli government over its continued illegal expansion of apartheid settler homes on occupied Palestinian land and the eviction of dozens of Palestinian families from their homes.“CAIR also calls on the Biden administration to condemn Israel’s recent attack on leading Palestinian human rights groups by labeling them as ‘terrorist institutions.’“The Biden Administration’s muted reactions to these and other crimes is emboldening the Israeli apartheid government to commit more crimes. Public pressure is necessary.”CAIR has previously called on the Biden administration to hold Israel accountable for its violations of human rights and end support for Israeli aggression.In August, CAIR joined Americans for Justice in Palestine Action and other civil and human rights organizations to protest outside the White House as President Biden welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to Washington, D.C.The groups demanded an end to the Israeli government’s ongoing and systematic violations of Palestinian human rights, and the Biden administration’s unconditional support for Israeli apartheid.The protest also called for an end to US military and diplomatic support of all human rights violations, including an immediate halt to forced expulsions of Palestinians from their homes in Jerusalem, and the suffocating siege of Gaza.SEE: DC: CAIR to Join Groups in Protest of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s White House VisitCAIR has called on President Biden and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to reject Israel Envoy to the U.S. Gilad Erdan’s August request for a U.S. Visa Waiver Program deal “without a firm guarantee of reciprocal travel privileges for all Americans–including Muslim, Palestinian and Arab-American travelers who often face severe entry restrictions or outright travel bans when entering Israel– it would create an unequal system that benefits Israel while harming the United States.”SEE: CAIR Urges Biden Administration to Reject Israel’s Bid to Join Visa Waiver Program, Cites Discrimination Against American Muslim, Arab-American TravelersIn July, CAIR welcomed the U.S. State Department’s call for an end to Israel’s illegal collective punishment demolitions of Palestinian homes following the leveling of a house in which the family of a Palestinian-American attack suspect was living.SEE: CAIR Welcomes State Department Call for End of Collective Punishment Practice by Israel, Urges More PressureIn June, CAIR called on the Biden administration to condemn the Israeli government’s ongoing demolition of 100 Palestinian homes and businesses in the Silwan neighborhood in East Jerusalem to build a religious theme park on the land.SEE: CAIR Calls on Biden Administration to Condemn Israel’s Ongoing Demolition of Palestinian Family Homes, Businesses in SilwanIn June, CAIR also joined a coalition of more than 100 national organizations calling on President Biden to stop the sale of $735 million in advanced weapons to Israel.The sale would include the same type of missiles that were used by Israeli forces to kill more than 200 civilians, including more than 60 children, and destroy residential buildings in Gaza.SEE: CAIR Joins 100+ National Groups Calling on Biden to Stop Weapons Sales to IsraelIn May, CAIR called on President Biden to “unequivocally condemn” the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque (Masjid Al-Aqsa) compound – shooting rubber bullets and firing tear gas at worshipers and Palestinians holding a rally celebrating the recent cease-fire — jeopardizing its continuation.SEE: CAIR Calls on President Biden to ‘Unequivocally Condemn’ Israeli Police Again for Storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound, Jeopardizing Cease-FireIn March, CAIR joined more than 130 organizations led by the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) and activists for the National March for Palestine in Washington, D.C., to support mounting international pressure on Israel’s attacks against Palestinian civilians, particularly children, hospitals, homes, schools, and libraries.SEE: Video: CAIR Joins 130+ Groups at National #March4Palestine in Washington, D.C. – #SanctionIsraelCAIR’s mission is to protect civil rights, enhance understanding of Islam, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.La misión de CAIR es proteger las libertades civiles, mejorar la comprensión del Islam, promover la justicia, y empoderar a los musulmanes en los Estados Unidos.Become a Fan of CAIR on Facebookhttp://www.facebook.com/CAIRNationalSubscribe to CAIR’s Email Listhttps://action.cair.com/a/newslettersSubscribe to CAIR’s Twitter Feedhttp://twitter.com/cairnationalSubscribe to CAIR’s YouTube Channelhttp://www.youtube.com/cairtvFollow CAIR on Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/cair_national/Donate to CAIRhttps://action.cair.com/a/donateDo you like reading CAIR press releases and taking part in our action alerts?
