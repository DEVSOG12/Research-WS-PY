"Out of the Shadows: Casting Light on CIA Torture" not only provides people of faith with a vivid and disturbing picture of CIA torture, but also presents a compelling story about the pathway out of this horrific chapter. The film is available at www.nrcat.org/shadows.Rev. Ron Stief, executive director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, said about the film:"The period in which the CIA tortured detainees was tragic for our country. Torture violated our deepest morals and failed to make our country safer. The film describes the CIA's use of torture as well as the eventual rejection of torture by people from a wide swath of America's different communities. Watching it will not only provide viewers with information about torture, but also enable them to join the growing community of folks who are working to end torture."Fortunately there is a growing consensus in this country among politicians and people of faith across the religious and political spectrum – torture is always wrong and should never be part of government policy."There is a lot more to be done, but already the first steps have been taken to end CIA torture forever."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
