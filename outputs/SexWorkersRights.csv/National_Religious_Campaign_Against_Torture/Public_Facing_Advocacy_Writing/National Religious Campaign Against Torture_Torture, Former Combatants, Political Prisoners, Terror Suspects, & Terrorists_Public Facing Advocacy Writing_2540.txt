Representatives of California Families Against Solitary Confinement (CFASC) will bring stories of their own and other families whose loved ones have been locked under the torture of solitary confinement -- some of them for decades.During the hunger strike in California prisons last summer, in which 30,000 inmates participated, Secretary Beard initially promised the meeting “after the prisoners go off hunger strike.” The meeting was finally scheduled as advocates prepare to observe the one-year anniversary of the historic strike.Also on Thursday, a delegation of faith leaders will meet with Kathleen Allison, Deputy Director of the Division of Adult Institutions, Facilities Support, at CDCR, whose jurisdiction includes religious affairs.The delegation will include:Rev. Ron Stief, executive director, National Religious Campaign Against TortureRabbi David Cooper on behalf of T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human RightsBasim Ekarra, executive director of the Sacramento Valley Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic RelationsRev. Cubie Finley III on behalf of the African Methodist Episcopal Church Social Action CommitteeRev. Phillip Lawson, pastor emeritus, Easter Hill United Methodist Church, Richmond, Calif.Laura Magnani, Program Director, Healing Justice, American Friends Service Committee San Francisco OfficeClergy will echo the family members’ calls for an end to torture in correctional facilities and will discuss the retaliation prisoners have experienced since participating in the non-violent hunger strike protest.Media is invited to gather outside CDCR headquarters, 1515 S Street, in Sacramento, at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, June 26, to hear feedback from the meetings as well as advocates’ hopes and expectations going forward.The meetings with Beard will take place at 11 a.m. at the CDCR. Faith leaders will pray for the families, the men and women in solitary, correctional staff, and survivors of crime while the families are meeting with Beard. The faith delegation will have their meeting with other CCDR officials at 12 p.m. and will deliver hundreds of prayers cards submitted by people from diverse faith traditions nationwide, to be distributed to incarcerated people who remain in long-term isolation.“Our hope is to stop treating each other as enemies and to open up communication,” said Dolores Canales, a founding member of CFASC. “As we move toward abolishing this form of torture, we see these meetings as a first step toward finding positive solutions.”Added Laura Magnani, Program Director for Healing Justice, who works out of American Friends Service Committee’s San Francisco Office, “There is no doubt that prolonged solitary isolation constitutes the torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment banned by the UN Convention Against Torture.”“As faith leaders and representatives of many traditions, we have an ethical obligation to confront anything that degrades or causes suffering in all places and in any circumstances,” said Rev. Stief of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture. “Half of all completed suicides in prison occur in solitary confinement. Further, the use of isolation creates a toxic environment for correctional staff.”###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
