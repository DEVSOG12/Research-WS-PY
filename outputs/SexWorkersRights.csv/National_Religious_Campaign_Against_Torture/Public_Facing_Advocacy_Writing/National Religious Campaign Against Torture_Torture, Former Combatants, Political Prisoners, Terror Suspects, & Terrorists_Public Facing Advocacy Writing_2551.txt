Rev. Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released the statement below describing why his organization signed onto the letter.  Go to full text of the letter."People of faith know that torture is always wrong, and people of faith also know that injustice cannot be condoned. We are very concerned by reports that an individual who was responsible not just for torture, but also for destroying the evidence of torture, is being considered for promotion within the CIA. If true, these reports suggest that there not only has not been justice for those who engaged in torture, but that in fact, those who tortured or authorized torture may be promoted.During his own confirmation hearings, CIA Director John Brennan stated his personal opposition to torture. We hope he holds true to this sentiment during his tenure at the CIA by not appointing individuals responsible for torture to higher level positions."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 320 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
