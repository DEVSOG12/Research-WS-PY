Torture is immoral and abhorrent, violating the teachings of all ourreligious traditions," said Rev. Richard L. Killmer, Executive Director of theNational Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT). "Just as adamantly, we nowcondemn these alleged acts of illegal and immoral experimentation. Separate anddistinct from the torture, such medical experiments could themselves constitutewar crimes and possibly crimes against humanity."NRCAT,a membership organization consisting of more than 280 religiousgroups committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman anddegrading treatment, organized the press conference. Linda Gustitus, Presidentof NRCAT participated on the panel with Dr. Ingrid Mattson, President of the IslamicSociety of North America; Rev. Dr. Michael Kinnamon, General Secretary of theNational Council of Churches; Rev. Richard Cizik, President of the New EvangelicalPartnership for the Common Good; and Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of the ReligiousAction Center of Reform Judaism."The essence of Americais our commitment to the rule of law," said Dr. Ingrid Mattson, President of the Islamic Society of North America. "And as the Koran says, ‘do not letthe hatred of others swerve you from justice'. We must fight to protect thelaws and treaties such as the Nuremberg Code."PHR's new report uncoveredand documented evidence of the involvement of CIA health professionals inperforming experiments, without consent, on detainees in the custody of the U.S. followingSeptember 2001.Such experimentation would violatethe legal and ethical protections afforded by the Nuremberg Code, the Geneva Conventions,federal regulations governing human subject research-known as "The CommonRule"-and the federal War Crimes Act."With the Nuremberg Code we identified a set of boundaries so asto prevent people from taking the same disastrous path that was followed inWorld War II," said Rabbi DavidSaperstein, Director of the ReligiousAction Centerof Reform Judaism. "PHR's new report found that our country crossed theline by involving health professionals in experimentation. We need acomprehensive investigation so we can establish safeguards that will trulyprevent violations in the future."All of the panel participants acknowledged that their faiths donot agree on all things spiritually, politically and socially, but they doagree that torture goes against American values."These findings should disturb every person of faith," said Rev. Richard Cizik, President of the NewEvangelical Partnership for the Common Good. "America is a country with the soulof a church, synagogue and a mosque, and these crimes violated our collectivenational soul."The PHR report details how the experiments and the participationof health professionals in the interrogations of detainees were criticalcomponents for the fabrication of a legal framework construed to protectinterrogators from prosecution for committing acts of torture. The experimentsalso served to refine the illegal torture practices used by the U.S. government."The evidence is absolutely shocking and repulsive," said Rev. Dr. Michael Kinnamon, GeneralSecretary of the National Council of Churches. "Torture is an affront toGod and the denial of the bedrock convictions of all people of faith."NRCAT and the panel participants reiterated their call to thePresident and Congress to establish a Commission of Inquiry to undertake acomprehensive investigation into the use of torture - including its use inmedical experiments on detainees - and to pursue the steps required to ensurethat U.S.-sponsored torture will never again be sanctioned and practiced.///The NationalReligious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a growing membershiporganization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman anddegrading treatment.
