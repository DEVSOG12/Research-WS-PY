The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that contribute to chronic overcrowding in the county’s jails and provides recommendations for improvements.Los Angeles County has the world’s largest jail system and is part of what may be the most complex criminal justice system in the United States. Making the county’s criminal justice system more fair and efficient is even more crucial in light of California’s realignment legislation. Although LA County is in many ways unique, Vera’s recommendations are relevant to many other jurisdictions throughout the country.RelatedPUBLICATIONLos Angeles County Jail Overcrowding Reduction ProjectOct 26, 201134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
