This digest equips the field with practical, actionable resources, and provides guidance on policing best practices by disseminating evidence-informed approaches.The fifth volume—released today—focuses on the timely topics of diversion programs, co-responder hot spot outreach teams, victimization reporting, and the implementation of body-worn cameras. It answers questions such as: What is the effect of prior police contact on a person’s decision to report crimes in the future? How does officer discretion impact their decision to divert people away from incarceration? And, how do body-worn cameras affect officer use of force and civilian complaints? Research was conducted by leading scholars and research organizations, including but not limited to, the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and the University of Missouri.In addition to making policing research more publicly accessible, the digest provides readers with information about current science to help examine emerging issues and how they might apply to one’s own police agency and community. We welcome input, questions, and suggestions—especially regarding research topics you’d like to see featured in future volumes—and look forward to your feedback and readership.Please forward any questions, suggestions, or subscription requests to EmergingIssuesPolicing@vera.org.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
