These include a onetime fee for conducting background checks on visitors 18 or older and a fee to put money in someone's prison commissary account.Most corrections departments also generate funds through high collect phone call rates—another cost to families. Admittedly, these fees vary widely by state. But a recent survey of prison phone contracts by Prison Legal News found states receiving an aggregate of $152 million per year in phone commissions. Fortunately, at least some states—Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Michigan, South Carolina, California, and Missouri—have thought better and banned these kickbacks.States that are serious about improving reentry outcomes should follow this lead. Increasing the hurdles to staying in touch is penny-wise and pound-foolish.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
