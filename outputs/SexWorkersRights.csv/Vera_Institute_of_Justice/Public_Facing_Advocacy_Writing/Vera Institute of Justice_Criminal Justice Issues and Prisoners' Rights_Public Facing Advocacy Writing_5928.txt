However, law enforcement agencies cannot report all the rapes they prosecute to the federal agency because most state and local jurisdictions use a broader definition of rape than the FBI uses. For example, in 2010 the Chicago Police Department recorded almost 1,400 sexual assaults, but according to a recent New York Times article, none of these appeared in the FBI’s statistics.The FBI’s 2010 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) reported a 5 percent drop in sexual assaults from the previous year. Although it is unclear whether or not there was an actual drop in sexual assaults, what is clear is that the discrepancy in definitions causes thousands of rapes to be excluded from federal statistics.Underreporting unleashes a variety of negative consequences: it misleads the public about the prevalence of rape, it can damage the credibility of law enforcement agencies tasked with responding to these assaults; and it makes it difficult to accurately demonstrate the need for services and supports for rape victims. These distortions can have a significant negative impact on public awareness and the resources dedicated to addressing the problem of sexual violence nationwide.In a recent op-ed in the Hill, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA) wrote that the Uniform Crime Report data plays a crucial role in the allocation of resources for crime prevention, treatment for victims, and law enforcement, and points out the need to include all types of rape in the UCR as "we face a tough fight to preserve funding for critical programs that aid victims and help put their assailants behind bars."Sexual assault is likely one of the most underreported crimes. The FBI’s new definition is one step toward assuring that more accurate data is available, resources are appropriately allocated, and, above all else, rape victims count.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
