His work frequently brings him to New Orleans to advance the criminal justice reform and open governance efforts OSF supports—and his message is inspiring.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
