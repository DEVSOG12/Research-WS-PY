One of the biggest challenges of getting 600 women off Rikers – which is how many are in the jail on any given day – is that they're often facing serious charges or have long criminal records or warrant histories that have kept them incarcerated for long periods of time.“Driving down the unique population of incarcerated women at Rikers is not an easy lift”, said Insha Rahman, program director at Vera. “However, the bold proposals of the Mayor’s Office to maintain family connections and build support systems for incarcerated women are a strong step forward in addressing the complex factors that lead them to jail and keep them there.”34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
