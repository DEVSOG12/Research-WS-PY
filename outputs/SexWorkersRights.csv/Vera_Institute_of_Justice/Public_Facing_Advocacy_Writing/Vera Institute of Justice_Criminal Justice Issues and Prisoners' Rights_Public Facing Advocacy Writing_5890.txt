The site is an innovative way to provide information about hundreds of nonprofit organizations in easily digestible video formats. Philanthropists may also communicate directly with participating nonprofit organizations through the Giving Library’s Connection Center.The Vera Institute of Justice is featured on the site through an interview with Michael Jacobson, the Institute’s director and president. As Vera begins its sixth decade of innovation to make the justice systems on which we all rely fairer, more humane, and more efficient, he sums it all up with this, my favorite, quote from his interview: “We are a nonpartisan organization that believes most government officials, whatever their politics, want to make their systems work better.”If you are interested in justice reform and would like to know more about what Vera has done and is doing in the pursuit of justice, take a few minutes to watch the video.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
