This Issue in Brief, produced by Vera's national Youth Justice Program, examines how this dramatic shift is helping get disobedient, but not delinquent, children back on track while yielding significant cost savings. Jurisdictions looking to better serve their own status offender populations will find useful models in this report's summary of the lessons learned in New York State.AuthorsTina Chiu34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
