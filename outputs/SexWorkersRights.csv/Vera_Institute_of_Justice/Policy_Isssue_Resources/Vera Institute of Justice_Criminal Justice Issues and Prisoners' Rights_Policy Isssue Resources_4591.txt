Studies show that kids in the system are much more likely to succeed long-term when they have frequent contact with their families. Unfortunately, juvenile justice agencies often have difficulty working with families and involving them in the decision-making process. This report offers three major steps agencies can take to improve their engagement efforts:Identification: Learning the strength of a youth’s support system and identifying as many positive adult role models as possible.Engagement: Reaching out to a youth’s support system and creating a welcoming environment.Empowerment: Consulting families at various decision-making points, educating families on the juvenile justice process and system, andinforming them of their rights.AuthorsRyan ShanahanMargaret diZeregaKey TakeawayYouth in the juvenile justice system fare best when their families are directly involved in their care. Agencies often struggle to properly engage families, but through Identification, Engagement, and Empowerment, agencies can ensure families are involved in their youth’s juvenile justice outcomes.Publication HighlightsKids who receive frequent visits from their parents often earn better grades, have fewer violent incidents while in custody, and have lower recidivism rates.Juvenile justice agency leaders need to send a strong, clear and consistent message about the importance of family to succeed.Family should be defined broadly to reflect all the positive people a young person can have involved in their life—including extended family, mentors, teachers, and coaches.Key FactsEvidence suggests that incarcerated youth who get frequent visits getbetter grades and have fewer violent incidentswhile in placement.A study from 1977 found that a family-systems approach not only reduced recidivism rates for justice-involved youth, compared to other models of treatment, but also reduced the rates of siblings’ involvement in the justice system.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
