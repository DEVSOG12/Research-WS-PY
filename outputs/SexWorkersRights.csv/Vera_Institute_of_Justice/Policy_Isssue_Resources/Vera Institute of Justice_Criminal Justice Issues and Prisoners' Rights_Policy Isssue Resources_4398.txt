In Louisiana, there are more than 30,000 people serving sentences in prisons and jails. Many people across the state urged the governor, the head of the Department of Corrections and Public Safety (DOC), and local lawmakers to act within their power to quickly and safely release people from jails and prisons. Unfortunately, many, including lawmakers themselves, seem unsure about where that power lies or what it entails. This lack of clarity, coupled with historical reluctance to fix Louisiana’s mass incarceration crisis, has resulted in minimal releases from jails and prisons.Key TakeawayUrgently decarcerating Louisiana requires an understanding of the legal mechanisms available. This document outlines who has the power to release people incarcerated in Louisiana, where in the law that power lies, and how many people could be released if that power was properly used.Publication HighlightsCOVID-19 has exacerbated and exposed the fact that far too many people are held in Louisiana’s jails and prisons.Elected and appointed officials across branches of Louisiana’s government each have unique powers to reduce the number of people held in prisons and jails across the state.During a state of public health emergency, Governor John Bel Edwards has additional authority to mandate release from incarceration.Key FactsThere were31,609people serving sentences in Louisiana jails and prisons as of December 31, 2019.As of July 5, 2020,42%of incarcerated people tested for COVID-19 by the state Department of Corrections were positive.If government actors exercised their power to the full extent of the law, approximately15,000people held in custody pretrial could be released.RelatedPUBLICATIONCoronavirus Guidance for the Criminal and Immigration Legal SystemsMar 17, 2020VIDEOEvent: We've Got the PowerJul 28, 2020NEWSA New Vision for Justice in New OrleansJul 20, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
