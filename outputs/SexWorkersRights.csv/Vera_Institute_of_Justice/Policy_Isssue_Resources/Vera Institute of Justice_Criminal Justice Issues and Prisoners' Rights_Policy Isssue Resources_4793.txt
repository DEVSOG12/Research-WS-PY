These orders are often a first course of action for victims who want the violence to stop but who do not necessarily want to involve the police. Usually, these orders serve their function and the "respondent" ends the violent behavior. In some cases, however, respondents ignore court orders and may even become more violent.

It is part of the Judicial Oversight Demonstration Initiative's four-part series Enhancing Responses to Domestic Violence.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
