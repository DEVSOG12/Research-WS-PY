The report takes a mostly positive view of CPOP and concludes that while shortcomings should be expected, CPOP represents a reasonably successful effort to move the New York City Police Department in a desirable direction and that the failings can and should be corrected with time, patience and renewed effort.AuthorsJerome E.
