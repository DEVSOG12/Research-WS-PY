However, what is often ignored are women’s unique pathways into segregation and the differential impact that its restrictive conditions can have on them. Through the Safe Alternatives to Segregation Initiative (SAS Initiative), the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) partnered with eight states and two jail systems to analyze their use of segregation and recommend safe strategies to reduce their overreliance on the practice. This fact sheet details Vera’s findings on the women-specific issues raised by the use of segregation in these facilities.AuthorsJessi LaChanceKey TakeawayAlthough the literature on the negative psychological and physiological consequences of isolation within prison is growing—and there is some movement in corrections departments to reduce the use of segregation—this work will be incomplete until the field brings incarcerated women to the forefront of the issue.Publication HighlightsWomen are typically sent to segregation for low-level, nonviolent behavior.The conditions of segregation are sometimes more restrictive for women than men, due to limited resources and space.The negative impacts of segregation can be greater for women, due to their higher levels of past trauma and abuse and unique health needs, among other factors.Key FactsVera researchers found that anywhere from3 to 12percent of women in the state prison systems studied were housed in segregation.In Nebraska, although approximately5%of women were in segregation, nearly 80% of those women were in the most restrictive form—compared to about 50% for men.Women with mental illness tend to be overrepresented in segregation. For instance, in Oregon84%of women in segregation had mental health treatment needs.RelatedSPECIAL REPORT (CHAPTERED)Rethinking Restrictive HousingMay 23, 2018STORY/CHAPTERWomen Behind BarsJun 21, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
