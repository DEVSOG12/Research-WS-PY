Bail reform ushered in a period of considerable decarceration across New York State, and the number of people in jail dropped even further as authorities responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state’s nearly 40 percent decline in jail populations proved that New York can reverse its decades-long investment in mass incarceration.But bail reform was only the first step—one that New York should protect and expand. Next, the legislature must reach beyond jails to New York’s prisons—which incarcerate over 30,000 people—by implementing parole and sentencing reforms. Vera’s Empire State of Incarceration report offers tools and data to track progress on reducing New York’s reliance on jails and prisons.AuthorsLauren JonesQuinn HoodElliot ConnorsKey TakeawayBail reform had an immediate—and dramatic—impact on jail populations across New York State. The state now has an opportunity to build on bail reform and other policy changes to reduce not just jail populations, but the racial disparities that have plagued jails—and the broader criminal legal system—since the United States was founded.RelatedARTICLEEmpire State of IncarcerationFeb 18, 2021PUBLICATIONThe Impact of New York Bail Reform on Statewide Jail PopulationsJun 21, 2022NEWSBlack and Grassroots Advocates Help Illinois Make History with Bill to End Money BailJan 29, 202134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
