This detention affects nearly 2,000 people a year and heavily inflates the local jail population. In this report, Vera conducted a thorough analysis of all probation and parole violation detentions in the year 2012, and concluded that pre-adjudication detention was overused in a high number of cases. Vera made the following recommendations to reduce the overuse of detention:Implement administrative sanctions as an alternative to a lengthy court process and, generally, to detention;Reduce initial use of detention by allowing more people to wait for their day in court in the community;Review the detention status of alleged violators routinely;Coordinate roles to develop common procedures for detention decision-making;Improve the effectiveness of proceedings; andImprove data collection and information sharing.These evidence-based recommendations are a key opportunity for jurisdictions to rethink detention practices, safely reduce jail populations, and improve the lives of people under supervision.AuthorsMathilde LaisneStephen RobertsJon WoolKey TakeawayWe must look at who we are putting in our jails, how long we detain them, and whether they should be there in the first place. New Orleans is an example of how detention can be overused and unnecessary, and how policy changes that reduce detention of alleged violators of probation and parole can improve public safety and reduce harm for people under supervision.Publication HighlightsDetaining probationers and parolees can greatly destabilize their lives—risking the loss of jobs, income, and housing—which hurts their chances of community success and increases their chances of recidivism.While discretion is allowed, it is not often used: large numbers of people are detained with no consideration of their circumstances or the appropriateness of detention.The majority of people who are detained for probation and parole violations do not go to prison after adjudication but are released and sent back to supervision.Key Facts503people are detained for probation and parole violationson any given day in Orleans Parish Prison, making up 19 percent of the total jail population.These jail stays cost New Orleansroughly $9.2 million in 2012—most of which is paid by city taxpayers.The overall local detention ratein New Orleansis more than double the national urban average.The average length of pre-adjudication detentionfor alleged violators isis 89 days.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
