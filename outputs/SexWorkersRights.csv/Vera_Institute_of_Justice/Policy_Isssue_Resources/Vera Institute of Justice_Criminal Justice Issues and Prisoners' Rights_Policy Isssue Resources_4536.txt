Unfortunately, PASU protocols provide cursory assessments of people’s health needs, lack the capacity to treat common, non-urgent ailments, and miss opportunities to advance jail diversion for people with behavioral health needs. In 2015, the Enhanced Pre-Arraignment Screening Unit (EPASU) pilot was launched in Manhattan Central Booking to address these limitations. This report describes empirical findings of a process evaluation of the EPASU conducted over an 18-month span. Researchers used mixed methods, drawing on analyses of administrative data, in-depth interviews, surveys, and focus groups with key stakeholders to assess the EPASU’s implementation and whether it reached its principal goals.AuthorsDavid CloudLeah PopeJim ParsonsAnne SieglerMichelle MartelleShow MoreKey TakeawayThe EPASU’s staffing and processes are promising improvements over the existing screening system in serving the health needs of people in contact with the justice system. Taking this program to scale is one important tool for addressing health disparities across the justice continuum and reducing the overrepresentation of people with behavioral and physical health disorders in New York City’s jails.Publication HighlightsThe EPASU staff, which includes a patient care associate and a nurse practitioner, can diagnose and treat many conditions, reducing needless hospital emergency room visits among arrested people.The EPASU produced a systematic method for identifying behavioral health needs and, with consent, sharing relevant information with defense counsel pre-arraignment that can be used to advocate for diversion.Expanding the array of medical services and number of social workers devoted to health promotion, jail diversion, and harm reduction will further enhance the operation of the EPASU model.Key FactsMost public defendersfound EPASU clinical summaries to be useful for helping their client at arraignment and later stages of adjudication.EPASU screening data revealed high frequencies of self-reported substance use and mental health needs among patients;4%of people reported having been prescribed psychiatric medication in the past three months, and nearly 9% reported daily alcohol use.The EPASU’s increased capacity to deliver medical care prevented an estimated601trips from central booking to a hospital emergency room from May 2015 to October 2016.RelatedPUBLICATIONA New NormalFeb 21, 2017NEWSOpportunities for improving mental health treatment and Rikers Island jailMar 28, 2014NEWSWith Public Support, States Continue to Embrace Drug Reform—and Save LivesJun 06, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
