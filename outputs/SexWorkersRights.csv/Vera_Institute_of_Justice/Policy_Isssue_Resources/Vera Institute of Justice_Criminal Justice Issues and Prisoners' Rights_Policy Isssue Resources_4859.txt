Researchers compared outcomes for Bodega participants with outcomes for a comparison group of drug users and family members, and conducted in-depth interviews with a subsample of both groups. The proportion of Bodega drug users who reported using illegal drugs declined from 80 percent to 42 percent over the six-month study period, significantly more than in the comparison group. Bodega family members also got medical and social service needs met at significantly higher rates than those in the comparison group.AuthorsEileen Sullivan34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
