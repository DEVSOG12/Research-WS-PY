We are inspiring and partnering with jurisdictions to build new reforms and programs that will better support the safety and well-being of girls and gender expansive youth in their communities, address the root causes of their incarceration, and permanently close the doors to girls’ juvenile detention and placement facilities. This publication outlines our 10-year strategy to make this happen.AuthorsLindsay RosenthalMahsa JafarianRelatedSPECIAL REPORT (CHAPTERED)Girls MatterJul 05, 2018NEWSThis Women’s History Month, Let’s Leave Girls’ Incarceration in the PastMar 27, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
