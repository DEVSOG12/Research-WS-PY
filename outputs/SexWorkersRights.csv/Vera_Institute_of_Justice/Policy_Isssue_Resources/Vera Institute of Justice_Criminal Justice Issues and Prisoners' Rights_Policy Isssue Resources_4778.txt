Vera’s analysis—a combination of statistical analysis and interviews with LOP stakeholders, including participants, providers, immigration judges, court administrators, detention facility staff, and ICE employees—identified numerous differences in case outcomes between LOP participants and comparison groups of detained persons who did not participate in the LOP. These differences suggest possible benefits of the LOP for those detained persons it is able to serve.AuthorsNina Siulc34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
