In recent years, this practice—also known as restrictive housing or segregation—has been the subject of increased scrutiny from researchers, advocates, policymakers, media, and the government agencies responsible for people who are incarcerated. Against this backdrop, and in light of growing evidence that restrictive housing may harm people without improving safety in facilities, a number of departments of corrections are taking steps to reduce their reliance on this type of housing.In 2015, Vera launched the Safe Alternatives to Segregation Initiative, with funding from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance. Through this initiative, Vera has partnered with ten corrections agencies on the local and state level to assess their policies and practices, analyze related outcomes, and provide recommendations for safely reducing the use of restrictive housing in their jails or prisons. Vera’s reports to these partners are presented here.AuthorsSara SullivanVedan Anthony-NorthDavid CloudLéon DigardLauren GalarzaFormer Program AssociateAllison HastingsProject DirectorJacob Kang-BrownSenior Research AssociateByron KlineFormer Senior Program AssociateJessi LaChanceStephen RobertsAssociate Director for ResearchLionel SmithResearch AssociateElena VankoFormer Senior Program AssociateJessa WilcoxFormer Senior Program AssociateShow MoreKey TakeawayThe number of people in segregation ranged from 3 to 14 percent in the lowest to highest jurisdictions. As in other parts of the justice system, restrictive housing affects disproportionate numbers of young people, people living with mental illness, and people of color; however, change is possible.Publication HighlightsVera partnered with 10 departments of corrections to assess their use of restrictive housing and develop recommendations.The practice can result in physical and psychological damage whose negative repercussions can persist well after release, making the transition to life in a prison’s general population or in the community considerably more difficult.Jurisdictions must pursue system-level strategies to foster people’s well-being and positive behavior in their facilities’ general population and ultimately reduce their use of restrictive housing.Key FactsConditions in restrictive housing units weremarkedby isolation and sensory deprivation.Low-level nonviolent offenses were among themost commoninfractions to result in disciplinary segregation sanctions.Changes to policy and practice shouldfocuson reducing the number of people entering restrictive housing, decreasing the time they spend there, and improving the conditions that they are held in to be the least restrictive possibleRelatedPUBLICATIONRethinking Restrictive HousingMay 01, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
