This report highlights 11 PHAs doing this work and examines best practices and lessons learned from their experiences—including key factors of program design and implementation (such as partnerships, program model, and funding), as well as ways to sustain programs once implemented. This guide is intended to serve as a resource for PHAs that are considering their own reentry programs or those that are exploring ways to strengthen existing initiatives.AuthorsJohn BaeKate FinleyMargaret diZeregaKey TakeawayPublic housing authorities are using existing resources and developing partnerships with other community stakeholders (such as community-based organizations and departments of corrections) to offer innovative, holistic, and practical solutions that address the housing challenges faced by formerly incarcerated people.Publication HighlightsSuccessful PHA reentry programs allow PHAs to focus on providing housing while relying on partners to provide services that are beyond the scope of their mandates and resources.Thorough assessments of a PHA’s population, the reentry landscape of its jurisdiction, and goals of partners are prudent to developing a program model that is responsive to the needs and desires of all stakeholders.Deliberate staff engagement strategies and community engagement activities garner support for PHA reentry programs within the housing authorities and with the general public, creating opportunities to spur innovation.Key FactsStudies show increased access to housing options for formerly incarcerated peopledecreases their risk of homelessnesswhich, in turn, increases their chances of successfully transitioning into the community after incarceration.There are more than3,000public housing authorities across the country serving more than 1 million households.While most public housing authorities are in urban areas,40%of PHAs are found in rural or suburban areas across the country.RelatedPUBLICATIONPublic Housing for People with Criminal HistoriesSep 03, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
