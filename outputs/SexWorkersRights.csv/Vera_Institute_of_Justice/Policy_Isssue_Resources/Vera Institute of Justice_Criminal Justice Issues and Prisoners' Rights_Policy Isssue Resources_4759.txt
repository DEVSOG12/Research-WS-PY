From 2004 to 2008, educational neglect allegations increased by 34 percent statewide. Most of these allegations involved children ages 13 to 17. Concerned about this increase and the unique circumstances of teenagers who are not attending school regularly, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services, with support from Casey Family Programs, asked the Vera Institute of Justice to study New York State’s approach to educational neglect and to suggest strategies for improving the system’s response to cases involving teenagers.AuthorsJessica Gunderson34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
