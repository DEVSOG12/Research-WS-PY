The research included community resident interviews, analysis of TNT operations, ethnographic study of local drug sellers and consumers, and panel interviews with community residents and leaders. It concludes that it is difficult to determine whether any apparent "drying up" of drug markets resulted from the enforcement intitiative, but that advantages due to the study's quasi-experimental design and multi-method approach as a means of assessing the community-level effects of targeted street-level drug enforcement are evident.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
