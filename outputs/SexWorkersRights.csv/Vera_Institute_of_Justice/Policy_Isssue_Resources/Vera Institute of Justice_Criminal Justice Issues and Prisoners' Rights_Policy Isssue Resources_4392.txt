Despite the importance of the 911 call system, little information exists on the nature of calls for service, how they are handled, and how police respond. The Vera Institute of Justice partnered with two police departments to study this crucial component of the policing system. Researchers employed a five-pronged mixed methods approach: reviewing the literature on 911 calls for service; mapping the 911 call system process and analyzing 911 call audio records; analyzing computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data; applying Natural Language Processing techniques to assess narrative fields in CAD data; and analyzing linked CAD and record management system data. By combining these five research components, Vera sought to identify alternatives to traditional 911 call-processing practices that could potentially improve outcomes for community members, call-takers, dispatchers, and police officers.AuthorsRebecca NeusteterMegan O'TooleMawia KhogaliAbdul RadFrankie WunschelResearch AssociateSarah ScaffidiMarilyn SinkewiczFormer Senior Research AssociateMaris MapolskiEditor | WriterPaul DeGrandisDaniel BodahApplied Justice Research FellowHenessy PinedaShow MoreKey TakeawayAlthough the 911 call system has been in use for 50 years, there is a lack of information on many of its core features, including how calls are processed; how call-takers, dispatchers, and other personnel are trained; and where opportunities for alternative responses exist and can be expanded.Key FactsThere are240 millioncalls to 911 each year.RelatedNEWSCoronavirus, Mental Health, and the Enduring Importance of Health-Centered Crisis ResponseMay 28, 2020PUBLICATIONMaking 911 AccessibleFeb 19, 2020NEWSProtecting Black Lives: The Crisis of American PolicingJun 08, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
