These practices have long plagued New Orleans, driving jail incarceration and costing struggling families—most of them black—millions. Two federal courts recently ruled that judges cannot lawfully impose money bail or enforce conviction fees because their own institution stands to benefit financially from these same decisions. To its credit, New Orleans has been taking the initiative to change by, for example, virtually eliminating money bail for municipal offenses and replacing all revenues the Criminal District Court would lose by eliminating money bail and conviction fees. The system is now paid in full. The next step is to align court practices with this new system of funding to end money injustice and replace it with a fairer and safer system. This report sets out a blueprint to achieve that reality.AuthorsJon WoolAlison ShihMelody ChangKey TakeawayBy taking the actions set out in this report, Criminal District Court judges, the mayor, and city council members will make New Orleans the first city in the country to replace money bail and conviction fees with a fair, safety-promoting, and financially stable system of justice.Publication HighlightsReplacing money bail with the practices outlined in this blueprint is projected to reduce the number of New Orleanians in jail on any given day by 304 to 687 people.New Orleans’s families will be able to keep the nearly $9 million they now spend each year to buy their freedom and spend that money on basic necessities instead.The city will save $5.5 million in taxpayer money from unnecessarily jailing people and will be able to reinvest it in ways that will help support the community.Key FactsNew Orleans puts people in jail at a rate30%higher than the national average.In 2017, money bail and conviction fees constituted25%of the Criminal District Court’s operating budget.An annual investment by the city of just$2.8Mabove current baseline appropriations would replace all revenue lost by ending unfair money-based practices.In 20178 out of 10felony defendants who spent more than two days in jail because they couldn’t pay bail were black.RelatedPUBLICATIONPast DueJan 09, 2017VIDEOBail, Fines, and FeesJul 25, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
