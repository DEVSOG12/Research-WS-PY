Highlights of the impact analysis are: 1) of the property misdemeanor recidivists sentenced to the project, many would have drawn jail sentences without the project, and thus the program significantly reduced the demand for jail cells. Given Rikers Island at an over capacity, the economic value to the City of reducing cell demand is substantial.AuthorsJudith A.
