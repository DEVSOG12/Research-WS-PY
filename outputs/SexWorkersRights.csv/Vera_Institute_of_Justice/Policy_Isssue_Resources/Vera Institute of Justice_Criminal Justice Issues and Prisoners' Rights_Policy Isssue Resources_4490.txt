The roundtable explored whether the guardianship system in New York is effectively serving those who need it.Senator Kemp Hannon and Senator John Bonacic convened the event. Participants included senators from all over New York State, including Senators Diane Savino, Gustavo Rivera, Leroy Comrie, and Roxanne Persaud from districts in New York City. Also in attendance were Judge Arthur Diamond of the New York State Supreme Court in Nassau County, Judge David Guy of the Broom County Surrogate Court, John Holt of The Guardianship Project, Vera Institute of Justice, and other elder law and elder care practitioners and agencies.AuthorsSusan De MaioKey TakeawayBy 2030, there will be more 80-year-olds than five-year-olds and the high costs of nursing home care will soar. Roundtable participants questioned whether the current legal system, social service system, and the legislature are prepared for the older adult wave that is coming relatively soon.Publication HighlightsGuardianship court judges expressed challenges with finding competent, qualified guardians because many in need do not have a family member or friend to care for them.The courts also expressed concerns on their ability to monitor compliance with the law because of limited staffing and resources that prevent the timely review of guardianship reports.A variety of solutions were suggested including pilot project testing, better data to assist policymakers, public education about guardianship alternatives, and earmarking more money to adequately compensate guardians for the work that they do.RelatedNEWSThe Question of Guardianship: How the Elderly Lose Their RightsNov 27, 2017NEWSCNN Article on Elder Abuse Highlights Increased Need for Guardianship ServicesMar 21, 2017NEWSSeniors Facing Cognitive Decline Need Responsible Financial Care from Banks, Families, and Community ProvidersMay 12, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
