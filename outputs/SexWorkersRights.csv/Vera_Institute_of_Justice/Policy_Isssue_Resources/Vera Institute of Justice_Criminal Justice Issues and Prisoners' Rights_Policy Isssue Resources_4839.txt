In his view, real-world experiments not only promise to solve particular problems, they create an appetite among government leaders at all levels for an objective and grounded approach to reform that actually makes the policy environment more legitimate and effective. To make his point, Stone describes three Vera experiments and their impacts. He begins with the 1961 test of strong community ties as an alternative to money bail that established the Institute and led to the United States Bail Reform Act of 1966. Empirically based reforms in South Africa and Russia provide contemporary examples of this approach.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
