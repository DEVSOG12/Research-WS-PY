"The term 'cracked trial' refers to the following phenomenon: in a criminal case committed to the Crown Court, a defendant may indicate at committal stage or shortly thereafter that he is pleading 'not guilty.' He may persist in this plea until the day scheduled for trial when, suddenly, he changes his mind and pleads guilty." This can cause numerous difficulties and delays in the criminal justice system.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
