With support from the Open Society Insitute and the United Nations Development Program, Vera assembled a team of researchers to revisit Haiti's often-studied but never-solved problem of prolonged pretrial detention and the related issue of poor prison conditions. This research shows that the situation is especially dire around the capital, Port-au-Prince, compared to provincial jurisdictions where limited training and procedural reforms have yielded some benefits. This report reviews the previous initiatives, identifies causes of persisitent problems, and recommends incremental reforms, immediate and long-range, for the Ministry of Justice and related government agencies.AuthorsAnne Fuller34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
