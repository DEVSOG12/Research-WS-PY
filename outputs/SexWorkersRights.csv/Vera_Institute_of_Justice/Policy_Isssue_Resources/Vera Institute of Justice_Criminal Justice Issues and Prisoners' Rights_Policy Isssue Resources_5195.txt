Under a contractual arrangement with the police department, the Vera Institute of Justice undertook to develop the program. In the ensuing ten months, Vera worked with the various criminal justice agencies to develop and coordinate comprehensive emergency plans. This report describes the progress made in this area and the work that remained to be done.
