This supplement expands Vera’s previous analyses by incorporating official Uniform Crime Reporting statistics for 2016 and providing data on crime rates for 294 cities with populations of 100,000 or greater, analyzed by population groupings and across census regions.AuthorsBruce FrederickKey TakeawayUltimately, the message from the FBI’s 2016 data is this: America is much safer than it was two or three decades ago, and its response to crime is working in most places, which have stable or declining crime rates.Publication HighlightsAcross all crime types, most cities experienced stable rates of reported crime between 2015 and 2016.The analyses presented in this supplement confirm that the majority of U.S. cities with populations of 100,000 or greater have not been experiencing unusual increases in violent crime generally or homicide specifically.Although crime levels did increase in 2016 in some places, these increases do not represent a nationwide crime epidemic, but rather a city-level phenomenon that will require targeted local solutions.Key FactsProperty crime continued a 20-year20-year decline.Homicide and total violent crime increased slightly in 2015 and again in 2016but remained close to their lowest levels in decades.Far more cities experienced decreases or minimal changes in crime ratesthan experienced large or notable increases.RelatedSPOTLIGHTFor the RecordJul 19, 2017NEWSSafe in America - What the FBI Crime Data Really Tells UsSep 22, 2017PUBLICATIONThe Prison ParadoxJul 20, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
