The program was intended to help develop community policing programs with the goal of reducing the demand for drugs through drug enforcement, interagency cooperation, referral to treatment and community-based prevention initiatives. The eight INOP sites were Tempe, AZ; Norfolk, VA; New York, NY; Hayward, CA; Portland, OR; Prince George's County, MD; Houston, TX; and Louisville, KY.
