However, decision makers, health care providers, and staff often work with only a fraction of the behavioral health information that exists about their clients. Expanding the availability of behavioral health data could improve prevention, early intervention, and continuity of care at every stage in the system. It also has the potential to keep people out of jail and prison by appropriately diverting them to treatment in the community.There is growing interest in how to share data across sectors and agencies, but few examples. In this study, Vera researchers worked with six government agencies in the District of Columbia to study the availability and location of behavioral health information held for a cohort of people who were arrested in October 2012.AuthorsMarilyn SinkewiczYu-Fen ChiuLeah PopeKey TakeawayBehavioral health information was generated widely throughout the justice and health systems and the majority of the arrest cohort had pre-existing information relating to mental health and substance use issues. Expanding access to this data could greatly inform agency decisions.Publication HighlightsProtecting people’s behavioral health data is paramount. Vera developed a methodology that complied with stringent data protection statutes to match data across agencies.The justice agencies generated follow-up behavioral health information during contact for a minority of people who arrived with historical information.Historical behavioral health information could potentially be retrieved from each agency’s own archives for some of these clients.Key FactsAt arrest, the health and justice agencies together held behavioral health information for6in 10 people.9in 10people who were arrested and later transferred to the department of corrections had historical behavioral health information.70%of people with behavioral health information also had co-occurring mental health and substance use information.Justice agencieswere less likely to generate follow-up behavioral health information for menthan for women.RelatedPUBLICATIONClosing the GapJun 30, 2012NEWSThe role of research in filling system gapsMar 27, 2015NEWSLaying the groundwork for a more inclusive mental health systemFeb 26, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
