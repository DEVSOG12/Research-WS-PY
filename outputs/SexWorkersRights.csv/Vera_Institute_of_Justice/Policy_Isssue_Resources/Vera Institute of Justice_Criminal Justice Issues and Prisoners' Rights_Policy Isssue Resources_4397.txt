The U.S. legal system criminalizes survival behaviors associated with homelessness and fails to acknowledge that people who are homeless face impossible odds within the legal process. Black people, who already face a disproportionate risk of homelessness, are exposed to even greater disproportionate levels of policing after becoming homeless.This report outlines the ways in which people experiencing homelessness are vulnerable within the system and how this leads to negative outcomes at each justice system decision point. It also highlights the urgent need for alternate approaches to break the cycle. In a year when the United States is weathering an unprecedented public health crisis, it is more important than ever that jurisdictions implement policies that prioritize safety, health, and justice for all.AuthorsMadeline BaileyErica CrewMadz ReeveKey TakeawayThe criminalization of homelessness leads to a never-ending and escalating cycle that shuffles people from the streets to the jail and back again.Publication HighlightsCitations for low-level offenses associated with homelessness—such as sitting or camping outside—often result in arrest and jail time if a person fails to appear for an initial court date.Formerly incarcerated people are nearly 10 times more likely to experience homelessness than the general public.Fees for probation or parole—such as required alcohol treatment and electronic monitoring fees—can add up to amounts that are impossible for people who are experiencing homelessness to pay.Key FactsSince 2006, there has been amarked increasein the passage and enforcement of policies criminalizing unavoidable aspects of homelessness.35%of U.S. cities have laws prohibiting loitering, loafing, and/or vagrancy citywide; 60% have similar bans affecting public places.62%of Black peoplein San Francisco reported being searched by police while experiencing homelessness and 76% reported receiving citations, compared to 52% of white people searched and 66% cited.RelatedPUBLICATIONCoronavirus Guidance for the Criminal and Immigration Legal SystemsMar 17, 2020PUBLICATIONPreventing Suicide and Self-Harm in JailJul 08, 2019PUBLICATIONChanging Course in the Overdose CrisisFeb 21, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
