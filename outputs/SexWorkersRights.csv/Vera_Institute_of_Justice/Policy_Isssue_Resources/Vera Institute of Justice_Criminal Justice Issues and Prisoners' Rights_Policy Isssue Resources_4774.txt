Over the past several years, performance indicators measuring aspects of the rule of law that range from fair elections to judicial independence to the integrity and accountability of law enforcement have been developed and used by dozens of organizations. This paper explains the methods we used to conduct the review and presents the results of our assessment, with a focus on the ways in which existing approaches and tools must be modified and expanded in order to measure the rule of law, and the administration of criminal justice in particular, in post-conflict countries.AuthorsJim ParsonsMonica ThorntonBesiki KutateladzeApril BangHyo EunAminou YayaShow More34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
