The main thrust of the study was first to develop data on the processing of felony arrests and second to determine and measure the factors shaping disposition of these arrests. It also includes both quantitative and qualitative data on: the comparative use of complaint room and Grand Jury in the four large boroughs; the comparative incidence of "over-charging" and "over-indicting," the relative impact on disposition of private, Legal Aid or assigned private counsel; the influence of pretrial status on disposition.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
