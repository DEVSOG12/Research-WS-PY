What follows are nine other ways in which we worked to seize this opportunity—and seed further opportunities going forward—with a focus on our core priorities: reducing mass incarceration by stopping the overuse of local jails; improving conditions for people living in our prisons and jails; and, in a soon-to-be majority-minority nation, improving trust in the justice system, particularly between law enforcement and the communities they serve.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
