There is a growing demand across the country for greater transparency in policing—and access to data is a key way to increase this transparency. 911 open databases are a prime example of accessible data that communities can use to highlight their needs and keep their local departments accountable. The Vera Institute of Justice and Two Sigma Data Clinic have collaborated to better understand 911 using publicly accessible data. This series explores 911 open datasets across five major cities and provides a comprehensive guide on how to access, clean, and analyze 911 open dataset so that everyone has the ability to use these public resources.AuthorsTwo Sigma Data ClinicAbdul RadFrankie WunschelRelatedRESOURCE SITEArrest TrendsMay 26, 2021PUBLICATIONGatekeepersAug 12, 201934 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
