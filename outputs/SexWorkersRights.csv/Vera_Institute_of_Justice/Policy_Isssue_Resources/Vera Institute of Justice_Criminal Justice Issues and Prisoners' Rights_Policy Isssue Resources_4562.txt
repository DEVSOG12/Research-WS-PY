A new vision is needed to meaningfully address violence and reduce the use of incarceration—and to promote healing among crime survivors and improve public safety. This report describes four principles to guide policies and practices that aim to reduce violence: They should be survivor-centered, based on accountability, safety-driven, and racially equitable.For more on this report, read a interview with author Danielle Sered and Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of The Marshall Project, and a related commentary in the Washington Post’s True Crime blog.AuthorsDanielle SeredKey TakeawayThe country cannot incarcerate its way out of violence. As a violence intervention strategy, prison fails to deliver the safety, justice, and accountability all people deserve, and at great human and financial cost. Increasingly, this message is being shared not only by justice reformers, but by crime survivors themselves.Publication HighlightsIt is essential to reduce violence and incarceration. Data show that both can happen at the same time.A new vision for justice must address violence in its community and historical contexts and in a way that honors all crime survivors and insists on racial equity.To reduce violence and mass incarceration, we must prioritize safety over politics.Key FactsA Justice Strategies/Harvard study showed that over 10 years, serious crime in NYC fell by58%while the incarceration rate decreased by 55%.A full52%of victims of violent crime do not report to the police. Many attribute this to a belief that the police could not or would not do anything to help.In a recent national survey,69%of survivors said they would prefer holding people accountable through options beyond prison, such as rehabilitation, mental health or drug treatment, or community supervision.RelatedPUBLICATIONYoung Men of Color and the Other Side of HarmDec 16, 2014NEWSBlack Wounds MatterOct 15, 2015VIDEOThe Case for Diversion / Race and Justice in AmericaNov 12, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
