With the help of our community, we can send this information to even more incarcerated people across the country! Print one or both of these documents and mail them to your incarcerated loved ones so we can support our incarcerated community in accessing their stimulus payments!Full 6-page documentHighlights: 2-page documentHere is the information we have provided for our inside family: You will need a Form 1040 (2020 Individual Tax Return). You can request one from your facility, or an outside person can request the IRS to mail it to you through this link: https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/forms-and-publications-by-us-mail. We have heard that the IRS is not consistently providing forms to incarcerated folks. Another way to get the form may be to get an outside person to mail it to you, depending on whether your facility allows you to receive blank forms.If your incarcerated loved one experiences difficulties receiving their form from the IRS, you can access and print the 2020 Form 1040 here.Thank you for supporting our incarcerated community members in accessing their stimulus payments!Post navigation← Previous PostNext Post →General Inquiries​Black & Pink National is a national 501c3 organization based in Omaha, NE.2406 Fowler Ave Suite 316, Omaha, NE 68111admin@blackandpink.orgFacebook-fTwitterInstagramEnvelopeSign up to connect withBlack & Pink National!Black & Pink National is a prison abolitionist organization dedicated to abolishing the criminal punishment system and liberating LGBTQIA2S+ people and people living with HIV/AIDS who are affected by that system through advocacy, support, and organizing.Authorized Safe Housing Network PartnerCopyright ©2022 Black And Pink | Powered by Catapult Consulting SolutionsPrivacy PolicyTermsSitemapScroll to TopPlease join our annual Holiday Card Campaign & send some love & care to our incarcerated family this holiday season!Head over to this blog post or our PenPal Pairing Site to learn more and register today!
