To get a solution, put your problem out to a discussion. Because of the education I received at CVT, now I feel good – I know I have other people I can lean on. I have also learned from CVT that sharing my problem can help others.Now I understand about hope.Before CVT I was not feeling well because I was thinking so many things about life in my home country because of all I went through. But currently I’m good because I got education in CVT. I can control my life and my body once again. After my first month at CVT, when I wasn’t at the center, my life was feeling very torn. But I got different skills from CVT, and I learned that it’s up to me – I can feel well. I’m happy now and I can talk to people.I was in a bad place because of different problems in my homeland and also sicknesses that I had: typhoid, HIV, high blood pressure. Also because of the HIV, I just sat somewhere alone. I was not able to walk or do my domestic activities. I was always alone. But because CVT connected me, now I can take care of myself in my current life; I know how to organize and plan my daily activities.Before I was in a negative place, but now I know that people are here for me too.I came to CVT because of what I heard in the community about their work – other people said to come and see. Now because I joined CVT I know how to share with other people. Now if I feel that my body is too weak, I just do the exercises we got at CVT. I understand about hope and to be passionate, for my life.Now my life is so good: I’m still living, I’m still breathing. CVT takes this work as our parent. CVT is good, devoted people who give good counseling and exercises to people and help set things right in life.Now I see that I have meaning as a human being. My mind is clearer and my body is now feeling strong. I can now do things others do.*Name has been changed for security and confidentiality.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
