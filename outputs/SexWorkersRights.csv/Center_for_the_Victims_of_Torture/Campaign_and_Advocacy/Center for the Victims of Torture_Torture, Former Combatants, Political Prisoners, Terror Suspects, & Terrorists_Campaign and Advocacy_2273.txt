I was born in a metropolitan town in a country in Africa and grew up in a family of four: my parents and a sibling. Life was good and most importantly, very simple.I was well situated with a job and a wife in my early twenties; life was good. I knew things had become rough politically in my country, and during my second year in the university studying law, I knew I should participate in the struggle. However, when I spoke out against the government, it led to arrests, lockups and torture; it affected my job and my very own existence.I fled first to Belgium, but I still was not safe. I quickly took steps to get to the United States. Upon arrival, I felt like a five year old who is lost in New York. I made it to Minnesota. Thankfully, there I met a torture survivor who had been a client of CVT. With his advice, I went to CVT.Torture is a crime of the mind; it took me a while to realize the river of negativity that flowed out from me. And it wasn’t only that – because of the torture, I fully believed I would never amount to anything. That seed was planted in me after my torture experience.When I went to CVT, then I understood that I do not have the capacity to carry the weight of the past. Little did I realize the magnitude of help I needed. The whole concept of rehabilitative care was new to me, but it worked. I saw the true meaning of “listening is loving.” There is something about being genuine; it is the medicine of the heart.CVT stood by me until I was reunited with my family. Today, my life is different: I have a change in perspective, my trust level is high, and I enjoy safety and calm. I graduated with a Master’s degree and have a challenging job in a high tech field.  *Name and some details have been changed for safety and to protect confidentiality.Photo credit: Dreamstime.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
