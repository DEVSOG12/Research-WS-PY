You'll die with this alone.' But when I heard about the Center for Victims of Torture, I knew the torturers had lied.” – Survivor of TortureAt the Center for Victims of Torture, we are forging new ways to advance human rights and build a future free from torture. Through research, training, advocacy and our healing services for survivors, each initiative we undertake plays a role in building a larger vision for the torture rehabilitation movement. We provide a bridge between torture victims, the local community and society as a whole, working to restore the dignity of the human spirit one survivor at a time.HealingIn Minnesota, torture survivors receive out-patient care at several locations, including our Healing Center in St. Paul. A team of healers provides medical and nursing care, psychotherapy, social services and massage and physical therapy.In Georgia, CVT Georgia extends rehabilitative care to refugees and asylum seekers, incorporating the specialized care that is most effective for individuals who have survived torture..Our international healing initiatives are in refugee camps and post-conflict areas where few mental health resources are available. We train local community members and refugees to meet the mental health needs of their compatriots for the long term.TrainingAt CVT, training is about finding ways to strengthen and support the people and organizations that work with torture survivors. We offer training projects around the world so that individuals and organizations can learn new and improved ways to provide healing services to torture survivors.ResearchWe work with other torture victim rehabilitation centers to help them develop their own tools for measuring the impact of rehabilitation services on the well-being of torture survivors.  We conduct rigorous evaluation and monitoring to ensure the work we do is effective. Our healing services in Minnesota and at our international projects consistently document significant decreases in mental health symptoms.AdvocacyCVT’s Washington, D.C. office gives voice to people who were purposefully silenced by perpetrators of torture. In our nation’s capital, we show policy makers that there is hope, that survivors can regain productive lives of dignity.Main menuWho We AreWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowRead Ocen James's StoryRead Ocen James's StoryRead Other Survivor StoriesSubscribeSign up for updates and alertsEmail:ZIP/Postal Code:Spam Control Text:Connect with usHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
