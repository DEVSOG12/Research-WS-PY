PAUL, Minn. — The Center for Victims of Torture™ (CVT) today posted a statement as the world grapples with the COVID-19 outbreak.“We at the Center for Victims of Torture recognize that these are extraordinary times, and we join millions around the world in remembering our common humanity as we all cope with this new, challenging reality. We know that this time is very difficult for everyone, and we want to assure you that we are assessing and addressing issues and impacts as they arise. Our first priority is—and always has been—the well being of our clients, who are refugees and asylum seekers who have survived torture and war. As the world confronts the COVID-19 outbreak, CVT continues to stand in solidarity with survivors while closely adhering to guidance from respected sources in each of our international locations.“We share the concerns of our clients, staff and supporters as this crisis unfolds, and want you to know that we are doing all we can to take protective and constructive steps to mitigate impacts. CVT has taken measures to protect the health of our dedicated teams in all of our locations, including remote work where possible. We are reaching out to clients regarding their care, and we will be in contact with supporters as events or other plans change. We are closely monitoring how this situation evolves and will adjust accordingly.“Our mission to heal the wounds of torture remains steadfast, as it has since 1985. As we pursue that mission and rebuild the lives of survivors, we’re committed to doing all we can to ensure the continued safety and good health of our staff, volunteers, board members and other supporters. We urge everyone to be mindful of and to protect their own safety and good health during these unsettling times.” — Curt Goering, CVT executive director.-###-The Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit organization headquartered in St. Paul, MN, with offices in Atlanta, GA, and Washington, D.C.; and healing initiatives in Africa and the Middle East.
