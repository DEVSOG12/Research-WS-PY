A template email and all the members’ emails are found in the SWOP-USA Advocacy Google Drive.Email Representative J.R. Hoell and ask him to withdraw the HB 1613, the “end demand” bill. Conversely, Rep. Hoell’s bill seeks to implement an “end demand” or Swedish Model policy in New Hampshire. The law would criminalize clients. Studies have shown that end demand policies are not successful at helping trafficking victims (a primary rationale for their introduction) and actually can lead to more violence. Again, a template email is found in the SWOP-USA Advocacy Google Drive.Alert your local press. Though this bill is based in New Hampshire, the successful passage of HB 1614 could help establish a roadmap for prostitution decriminalization nationwide. Alerting your local press (especially alternative weeklies) and asking them to cover the bill and its story will help the bill gain traction.Spread the word and ask your friends to support HB 1614 too! Tell your friends, your family your neighbors, your aunt, your Twitter followers, and your Facebook frienemies to write in and support the passage of HB 1614 today! Share the toolkit link with them as well!Click to watch the HB 1614 press conference, featuring members of COYOTE Rhode Island & US Prostitutes Collective, who give compelling and thorough explanations as to why this bill should be supported.By Savannah Sly|2017-01-25T05:19:05+00:00February 4th, 2016|Blogs, Call to action|2,273 CommentsShare This Story, Choose Your Platform!FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInWhatsAppTumblrPinterestVkEmailAbout the Author: 						Savannah SlyRelated PostsStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)Staff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)Staff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)SWOP-USA stands in opposition of disguised internet censorship bill SESTA, S. 1963SWOP-USA stands in opposition of disguised internet censorship bill SESTA, S. 1963Moral Panic Monthly: Super Bowl Anti Sex-Trafficking Campaign Harms Minnesota Sex WorkersGalleryMoral Panic Monthly: Super Bowl Anti Sex-Trafficking Campaign Harms Minnesota Sex WorkersComments are closed.Search for:Subscribe to our mailing list-->CategoriesAnnouncementsBillsBlogsCall to actionDays of ObservanceEducationalEventsFact SheetsFund RaisingHear Our VoiceInformationLegislationNewsPrint OutsResearchResearch SummaryUncategorizedArchivesAugust 2020June 2020March 2020January 2020November 2019October 2019August 2019June 2019May 2019March 2019February 2019September 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014Find us on FacebookPopularRecentCommentsMale Sex Workers Condemn Raid on RentBoy.comAugust 28th, 2015Trans Day of Remembrance Statement & Fact SheetNovember 12th, 2015PEPFAR Consultation – Urgent Feedback from Sex Worker Stakeholders Needed!November 15th, 2015SWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsAugust 24th, 2020Call To Action!
