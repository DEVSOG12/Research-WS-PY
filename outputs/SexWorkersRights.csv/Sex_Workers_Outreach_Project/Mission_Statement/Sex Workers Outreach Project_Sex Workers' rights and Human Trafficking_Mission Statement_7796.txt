SWOP-USA continues to honor Dec 17th by hosting a multilingual website with advocate toolkits, global event details, and annual list of names, as well as providing event funding to local SWOP chapters and related groups.Since it’s founding in the Bay Area, SWOP has grown into a national network of regional chapters and local activists. This network works together to address stigma and criminalization through peer support, community outreach, media engagement, allied collaborations, and direct action. As the issue of sex worker rights emerges into mainstream consciousness, SWOP will be here to serve as a vehicle to bolster the work and voices of social justice advocates across the nation.About UsAdvocacy Agenda 2016-18FinancialsGrievance PolicyMission StatementOur ValuesResearch StatementStaff & Board of DirectorsPast Board Members & StaffFounders of SWOPOur Mission Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA is a national social justice network dedicated to the fundamental human rights of people involved in the sex trade and their communities, focusing on ending violence and stigma through education and advocacy.Recent PostsSWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsCall To Action!
