Cycle of Risk: The Intersection of Poverty, Violence, and TraumaBack to siteSocial IMPACT Research Center Publications Collection homekeyboard_arrow_leftBackCycle of Risk: The Intersection of Poverty, Violence, and TraumaMar 15, 2017|byKatie BuitragoAmy RynellSamantha TuttleDescriptionChicago is currently facing a devastating surge in lethal violence in addition to staggering rates of poverty across Illinois. Policymakers and community leaders are struggling with finding short- and long-term solutions to stem the violence and allow neighborhoods to heal. In the meantime, communities are fearing for their own safety and grieving over lost parents, children, friends, and leaders every day. The stakes forgetting the solutions right could not be higher. Poverty and violence often intersect, feed one another, and share root causes. Neighborhoods with high levels of violence are also characterized by high levels of poverty, lack of adequate public services and educational opportunity, poorer health outcomes, asset and income inequality, and more. The underlying socioeconomic conditions in these neighborhoods perpetuate both violence and poverty. Furthermore, trauma can result from both violence and poverty. Unaddressed trauma worsens quality of life, makes it hard to rise out of poverty by posing barriers to success at school and work, and raises the likelihood of aggressive behavior. In this way, untreated trauma—coupled with easy gun availability and other factors—feeds the cycle of poverty and violence.cloud_downloadDownloadvia IssueLabshare SharePublished bySocial IMPACT Research CenterGeographyNorth America / United States (Midwestern) / IllinoisNorth America / United States (Midwestern) / Illinois / Chicago Metropolitan AreaNorth America / United States (Midwestern) / Illinois / Chicago SuburbsCopyrightCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License×Share the collectionUse this form to customize and generate the code you need to display this content in your own environment - no programming required.
