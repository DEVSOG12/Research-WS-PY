In a letter to county boards of elections and sheriffs, advocates remind officials that most voters in jail retain their right to vote and that officials have an obligation to assist eligible voters.“People in jail awaiting trial—who are innocent until proven guilty—must be able to cast a ballot, as should those serving a misdemeanor sentence. Unfortunately, few jails have widescale outreach programs to ensure voters have access to the ballot, meaning far too many voters are simply disenfranchised,” said Mike Brickner, Ohio state director for All Voting is Local.“Democracy works best if everyone who is eligible can participate, and that includes people in the justice system,” said Jocelyn Rosnick, policy director, ACLU of Ohio. “Encouraging jailed voters to cast a ballot is also vital to their reentry after incarceration, ensuring they continue to participate and engage with civic life.”All Voting is Local and the ACLU of Ohio have sponsored trainings throughout the past year to help local activists enter jails and assist voters with registration and requesting an absentee ballot. Included with the letter is a fact sheet comparing past programs at the Cuyahoga and Lake County Jails with counties that only provide limited outreach programs.“When advocates are able to interact directly with jailed voters to assist them, participation increases greatly. Our organizations have recruited and trained nonpartisan volunteers across the state who are ready to assist election and jail officials with launching their jail voting program, and ensure that every voice is heard,” added Brickner.Ohio law allows voters who are in jail awaiting trial, and incarcerated for a misdemeanor conviction to vote. People who are on probation, parole or reside in a halfway house may also vote. Only those who are incarcerated after conviction for a felony are disenfranchised, but they may re-register to vote immediately upon release from jail or prison.Organizations who signed the letter include: ACLU of Ohio, All Voting is Local, Campaign Legal Center, Common Cause Ohio, Dayton Black Young Professionals, League of Women Voters Ohio, Northeast Ohio Voter Advocates, and Office of the Ohio Public Defender.Read the letter.###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdfACLUofOhio-NOVA-AVLOhio_2018JailVoterRegistration-AComparison_2020-0214.pdfpdfBOEJailedVotersLtr021320.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
