The request comes the day after the Ohio Parole Board unanimously recommended clemency for Mr. Tyler and the state of Oklahoma administered a botched execution eerily reminiscent of past Ohio botched executions."Now is the time for Ohio to pause executions while state leaders look to reform the system," said ACLU of Ohio Director of Communications & Public Policy Mike Brickner. "The botched execution in Oklahoma is another sad reminder of how broken our death penalty system is. After four botched executions in less than a decade, Ohio is at great risk of more problems with lethal injections. At this critical time where reform of the death penalty is possible, neither the public nor elected officials need the specter of botched executions distracting from this important work.""Pausing executions is not about whether Governor Kasich agrees with the death penalty," added Brickner. "Even supporters of the death penalty should agree that it must be fair, humane, and comply with our Constitution. The recent problems with lethal injections and those pointed out by the Ohio Supreme Court Taskforce suggest we have much work to do to before we should resume executions."Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyDocumentspdfLetterToGovKasichReTaskforceReport2014_0430.pdfRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
