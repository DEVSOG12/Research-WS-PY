Both bills have strong bipartisan support, demonstrating how important repeal is to both sides of the aisle.“The moment is ripe for repeal. The death penalty is an expensive, ineffective, racist, and arbitrary system that puts innocent lives at risk. We hope this billboard serves as a stark reminder to Ohio lawmakers that our capital punishment system is broken. We have legislative solutions that demand action,” noted J. Bennett Guess, Executive Director for the ACLU of Ohio. “As of today, 23 states plus Washington D.C. have cut ties with the death penalty, Ohio can and should be the next.”For more information, visit NoDeathPenaltyOH.comStay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
