Currently, the prison houses about 1,400 inmates overseen by the Bureau of Prisons and 580 detainees for the U.S. Marshal Service.“We are pleased that the Bureau of Prisons listened to our concerns about the mismanagement of the facility and mistreatment of prisoners, and decided not to renew its contract with CCA,” said ACLU of Ohio Senior Policy Director Mike Brickner. “However, we still are concerned that CCA will continue to house detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown and operate the Lake Erie Correctional Institute in Conneaut, Ohio, for those imprisoned by the state of Ohio.“As a just society, we have a responsibility to ensure that our jails and prisons treat inmates and detainees fairly and humanely,” Brickner said. “The track record of for-profit prisons run by CCA and other private companies is disgraceful, with increased violence and drug use, overcrowding, neglected medical care, and deteriorating facilities. These deplorable conditions were recently highlighted by the peaceful protest of 140 prisoners at the Youngstown prison in August. The culture of secrecy at private prisons leads to a lack of transparency and accountability to the public. We cannot stress this enough—the for-profit prison business is bad for prisoners, prison employees, communities, and taxpayers.“We hope that the U.S. Marshals Service and the state of Ohio will follow the lead of the Bureau of Prisons and cancel their contracts with CCA.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeImmigrant RightsPrisoners' RightsRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
