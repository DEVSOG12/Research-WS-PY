Today, the Court granted the State’s motion to dismiss the case.“We’re disappointed that the Court has not ordered Mr. Lichtenwalter’s release – the state must act now to protect all HIV positive and other medically vulnerable incarcerated people and to prevent a widespread public health disaster across Ohio.  We will continue pushing Ohio to do what Justice Donnelly writes that it must: ‘take serious, unprecedented steps to prevent the catastrophe of unmitigated spread of COVID-19 to the tens of thousands of prisoners.’ Every wasted moment puts thousands of lives at risk,” noted Elizabeth Bonham, Staff Attorney for the ACLU of Ohio.The ACLU of Ohio asked the Court to call all branches of government to act urgently to protect incarcerated people against the COVID-19 emergency. The ACLU of Ohio agrees with Justice Donnelly’s concurrence, and will continue advocating that the entire state heed it:“The whole of Ohio’s government needs to take serious, unprecedented steps to prevent the catastrophe of unmitigated spread of COVID-19 to the tens of thousands of prisoners in Ohio as well as to the tens of thousands of people who are prison employees along with those living in the households of prison employees. *** If each branch of our state government does its part, we have an opportunity, collectively, to be proactive and to protect Ohio’s vulnerable prison population from COVID-19."A copy of the decision is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdf2020-04-16-Decision.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
