The ACLU of Ohio also launched a Twitter Storm during Governor DeWine’s Tuesday press conference to elevate the importance and urgency of these issues.“We thank Governor DeWine, Director Chambers-Smith, and Director Gies for their swift action to publicly release information about COVID-19’s impact on Ohio’s incarcerated population. This effort should serve as a national model on how government transparency should function during a public health crisis,” noted Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio.The ACLU of Ohio will continue to monitor intake via the hotline covid19@acluohio.org so that people with a loved one behind bars can report concerns about COVID-19 in prisons, jails and youth facilities. The organization will also monitor the daily reports from ODRC and DYS to examine trends and work to find solutions to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in these facilities.The ODRC report and the DYS report are available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
