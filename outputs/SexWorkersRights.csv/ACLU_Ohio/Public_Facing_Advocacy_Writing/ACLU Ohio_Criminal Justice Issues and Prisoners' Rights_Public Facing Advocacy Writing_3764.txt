Reclaim. Restore Your Rights!We have all heard the saying, ‘It takes a village to raise a child.’  I would like to add, ‘It takes a village to fail a child.’As a society, we are very quick to take credit for any contribution we have made in the life of a successful young person. We should also start taking a very critical look at how our contribution, or our lack of contribution, affects young people that are not so successful.Register now for the 2014 ACLU of Ohio Biennial Conference!In many ways children are like bank accounts, you get out of children what you put in them. If we only deposit negativity and trauma in the lives of young people, then they will give us negativity and trauma in return. We all have opportunities to make deposits as individuals, but systems make deposits that affect a large number of young people, sometimes for generations.To learn more about how systems can traumatize children and to hear about exciting reforms we invite you to join the ACLU of Ohio for Resist. Reclaim. Restore Your Rights! 2014 ACLU of Ohio Biennial Conference.This conference will take place on July 26 in Columbus, Ohio and will examine a variety of topics including the school to prison pipeline and solitary confinement.The workshop, Zero Tolerance Makes Zero Sense: Harsh School Discipline will examine 20 years of harsh school discipline policies that have resulted in unnecessary suspension, expulsion, and criminalization of children for age-appropriate, minor school behaviors as well as efforts underway to reform such policies.The workshop, Out of Sight, Out of Mind: The Solitary Confinement of Children will examine the harmful affects of the solitary confinement of children in detention centers, jails, prisons, group homes, and schools, as well as recent reforms.Both workshops will offer CLE and CEU credits.Join us to learn how to help children become successful adults.Read more about these workshops and others at the ACLU of Ohio Conference, here.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDisability RightsJuvenile JusticeRacial JusticeRelated contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022ACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
