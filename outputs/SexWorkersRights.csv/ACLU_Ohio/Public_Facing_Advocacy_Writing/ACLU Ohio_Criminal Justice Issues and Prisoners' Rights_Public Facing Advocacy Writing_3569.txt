Bennett Guess, Executive Director for the ACLU of Ohio:“The news across the country, specifically in Ohio, has weighed heavy on our hearts this past weekend. The ACLU of Ohio stands with protesters who have risen up to demand justice in the name of George Floyd and countless other Black and Brown people who have been senselessly murdered by police officers across jurisdictions, across states, across decades. We must not lose sight of the undeniable, that there is a very clear through-line that spans all the way back to 1619 when slavery in this nation first began. Each tragic episode since, now exasperated by George Floyd’s murder, is a manifestation of a centuries-long disease – America’s original sin – which takes the form of systemic racism, oppression, and violence against communities of color.The weapons we’ve observed during this weekend’s statewide protests – including, but not limited to, tear gas, pepper spray, sound and flash grenades, wooden bullets, street closures, media bans, grossly over-broad curfews, mass arrests, delays in processing time for individuals, and deployment of The National Guard – illustrate the over-militarized police presence we have in this state and nation. Metropolitan police departments have an undeniable track-record of using excessive force against people of color, peaceful protesters, individuals experiencing homelessness, individuals in the LGBTQ community, and individuals with a disability.Until we address the systemic issues of racism, implicit bias, white supremacy, and white privilege in our criminal legal institutions – especially police departments – we will not have peace. We demand that the long shadow of American slavery be examined in the context of the protests of 2020 and the unrelenting brutality of U.S. police practices.”The ACLU of Ohio continues to push out “know your rights” resources that offer guidelines and suggestions on how Ohioans should engage in peaceful protests and exercise their First Amendment rights.For legal support, the ACLU of Ohio encourages protesters to contact the Ohio National Lawyers’ Guild at 614-654-6477.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
