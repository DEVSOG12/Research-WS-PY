Tell ODRC to Save Lives and Taxpayer Money by Supporting Medicaid Enrollment.Read the ACLU of Ohio’s letter calling on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC) to require jails to help their outgoing inmates enroll.Late in 2013, the National ACLU and the Drug Policy Alliance released Healthcare Not Handcuffs, calling for healthcare alternatives to incarceration. Now, Ohio is officially a Medicaid expansion state. But what exactly does that mean?Before January, 2014, low-income, childless adults under 65 and without a disability were not eligible for Medicaid. Now they are. The federal government will also pay 100 % of the cost for people who are newly eligible for Medicaid from 2014 to 2016, gradually decreasing to 90 % in 2020 and beyond. Additionally, Medicaid coverage for this newly eligible population will cover a number of services, including emergency care; mental health, substance abuse, and behavioral health treatment; and chronic disease management.This presents a major opportunity for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC).Research shows that 90% of those entering local and county jails are uninsured. This indicates that people who come in contact with the criminal justice system are in great need of healthcare. Research also indicates that chronic, behavioral, and mental health needs are high for people involved in the criminal justice system, but the lack of health insurance has been a hurdle to accessing care.Enrolling people involved in the criminal justice system in Medicaid gives law enforcement agencies and healthcare officials the opportunity to close the revolving jailhouse door, increase safety, decrease recidivism rates, and save both lives and taxpayer money.Other Medicaid expansion states are working to enroll their jail, probation, and parole populations, and Ohio should do the same. Let’s support successful re-entry and end our reliance on incarceration.To learn more about leveraging Medicaid expansion to reduce incarceration rates, read the following resources:National Association of Counties report, County Jails and the Affordable Care Act: Enrolling Eligible Individuals in Health CoverageMedicaid Expansion and the Local Criminal Justice System, featured in American JailsLeveraging National Health Reform to Reduce Recidivism & Build RecoveryStay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDisability RightsDrug PolicyRacial JusticeDocumentspdfLetterToODRCReMedicaidExpansion2014_0227.pdfRelated contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022ACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
