The organizations acknowledged and thanked Director Gies for recent transparency efforts to publicize information about youth in detention and correctional facilities across the state, but urge immediate action steps for all-systems involved youth.“Youth in shelter care and non-secure residential facilities may live in close quarters, be required to congregate in groups, and experience unsanitary conditions. To prevent the disastrous spread of COVID-19, Ohio must be transparent about policies to protect all systems-involved youth, not just those in secure detention facilities,” noted Claire Chevrier, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of Ohio.The juvenile justice organizations recommended that DYS emergency policies include each of the following measures: population reduction, education, programming and social connections, staffing plans, hygiene, screenings, housing and treatment, data, and legal contacts.“Each of our recommendations are necessary to preserve the lives of youth, staff, and members of our communities. Most importantly, youth in delinquency proceedings must be released, there must be ready access to adequate hygiene supplies, courses of treatment must be evidence-based, and the collection of data regarding COVID-19 in these facilities must be made public,” concluded Chevrier.A copy of the letter is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesJuvenile JusticeDocumentspdfLetter_OhioDYSOhioDJFS-YouthInShelterCare_2020-0406.pdfRelated contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ending the School-To-Prison Pipeline: A Case Study of Cincinnati...June 24, 2021Alarming New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack...April 22, 2021Introducing Our Columbus Police Contract Negotiation ToolkitMarch 12, 2021Dear Cleveland, We Need Bail Reform.
