Frequent changes in Ohio’s execution protocols have been the result of three botched executions spanning from 2006-2009 and federal court orders declaring the state’s protocols unconstitutional.Evidence continues to mount suggesting that death sentences have less to do with the actual offense committed, and more to do with factors such as race, socioeconomic class, and the location of the crime. Ohio Supreme Court Justice Paul Pfeiffer has turned against the system for this very reason, calling it a “death lottery.” Meanwhile, Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor’s death penalty taskforce has identified troubling issues, such as large racial and geographic disparities in capital convictions and the use of the death penalty on severely mentally ill people.“Beyond these questions, this system continues to run an ever-present risk of putting an innocent person to death,” said Brickner. “Since the return of the death penalty, six of the nation’s 143 death row exonerations have come from Ohio. Under these circumstances, we should be reassessing the machinery of death, not speeding it up.”Prior to his execution, McGuire’s attorneys made several appeals for clemency, arguing that the untested procedure was likely to cause him “agony and terror.”Ohio officials replied by declaring that McGuire was not entitled to a “pain-free” death.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
