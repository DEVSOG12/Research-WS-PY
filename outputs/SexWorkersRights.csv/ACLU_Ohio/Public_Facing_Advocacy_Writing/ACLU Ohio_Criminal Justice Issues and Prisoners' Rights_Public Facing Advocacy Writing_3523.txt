Gwin last month — at Elkton Federal Correction Institution. This is the first time the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block an order that would protect prisoners from COVID-19.In a rebuke this week, Judge Gwin noted that one in four people tested at Elkton had tested positive for COVID-19, and that the BOP was required to expedite the transfer and release of the 837 members of the medically-vulnerable subclass to home confinement and compassionate release. Nine people have died at the prison, making it one of the more deadly BOP-run prisons during this pandemic.David Cole, legal director of the ACLU, issued the following statement:“There are more than 800 people incarcerated at Elkton and at risk of serious illness or death from this virus. People have a constitutional right to health, safety, and dignity while incarcerated — something that Elkton has proven it cannot provide right now. Around the country, courts have been slow to step in and take responsibility to protect the tens of thousands of incarcerated people who are at risk from this virus. Bold leadership from courts will be required to mitigate the humanitarian crisis we’re facing. We urge the Supreme Court not to intervene and block an order that will save lives. It would be a tremendous mistake.”David Carey, senior staff attorney of the ACLU of Ohio, issued the following statement:“It’s been nearly a month since Judge Gwin ordered Elkton to start using every means at its disposal to move medically-vulnerable prisoners to safety. Instead of complying, the federal government has stalled and delayed at every turn. Even though the prison has still failed to conduct mass testing, we know for certain that nine people have died, and this deadly outbreak is continuing to worsen. If the Supreme Court issues a stay, halting the lower court’s efforts to force the expedited release and transfer of those who remain at high risk, the outcome will be devastating.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfNo19A1041_Williams-v-Wilson_Opposition-to-Stay-and-Appendix.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
