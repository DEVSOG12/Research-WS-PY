n many ways, JDI’s main office, in 
Los Angeles, is pretty ordinary. It 
has what you would expect to see in 
a busy workplace; there are desks,  
photocopiers, and a constantly running 
coffee machine. 
But our office also holds something that 
exists nowhere else in the world. In a dozen 
or so locked file cabi -
nets, stacked against 
the walls of an unoccu -
pied room, are decades' 
worth of letters written 
to JDI by incarcerated 
sexual abuse survivors. 
Together, these letters 
— more than 30,000 total — make up the 
world’s only archive of one of the worst hu -
man rights crises of our time. 
The letters offer a devastating glimpse into 
the lives of prisoners — of their isolation, 
their trauma, and their daily struggle to get 
by. But at the same time, these letters are 
brimming with hope. The pages document 
how people living in desperate conditions 
are able to persevere, and heal. 
Right now, JDI is fighting back against  
an Arkansas jail that has banned in -
mate letters (see page 4) . This policy is 
completely unnecessary, and dangerous;  
indeed, we have more than 30,000  
examples showing why letter-writing from 
prison must be protected.
I believe that one day we’ll stop adding 
letters to our archive. But when that hap -
pens, it won’t be because of shortsighted 
corrections policies. It will be because  
we have stopped prisoner rape, once and 
for all.

the border, children are living a 
nightmare. They are being held in 
cages, with no access to showers, 
toothpaste, or clean clothes. Food is often 
so scarce that kids go to bed hungry. 
These conditions, while horrific in their 
own right, hint at an even deeper human 
rights crisis. In a recent op-ed for the 
Houston Chronicle , JDI Executive 
Director Lovisa Stannow spotlights the 
rampant sexual abuse and harassment 
inside Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) facilities. There have been scores of 
reports of sexual assault against children 
in CBP custody — and those are just the 
cases that we know about. Considering It’s Time to Release Migrant 
Children from Custody 
Customs and Border Protection is holding scores of migrant children in nightmarish facilities — 
including the one pictured above, in McAllen, Texas. If the agency cannot protect the children in its 
custody, then it must release them. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)See Release Migrant Children, continued on page 2

Ithat kids typically don’t report abuse in any 
setting — let alone when they’re locked up, 
and the adults in charge don’t care enough to 
give them adequate food or soap — the true 
scale of the problem is unfathomable.  
The failure to keep migrant children safe 
should not come as a surprise. Sexual abuse 
thrives in detention facilities that are badly 
run — and the agencies that hold migrant 
children are a case study in poor leadership. 
Top immigration officials have done 
little to rein in toxic staff culture. Sexism, 
homophobia, and anti-migrant views are 
rampant among the rank and file. Speaking 
out against a fellow agent is taboo; under the 
“green code,” loyalty to the uniform is prized 
above all else, including human rights. Our Immigration Detention System is Broken — 
and Children are Suffering as a Result
Maricopa inmates used to have to write 
on postcards, like the one above.action  update                      
When You’re Locked Up, a Letter Is a Lifeline
testament to the importance of written cor -
respondence in survivors’ healing. 
So when it came to light that a jail in Baxter 
County, Arkansas, had made it virtually im -
possible for survivors to send or receive let -
ters, we were deeply alarmed. Our concerns 
intensified when a federal district court — in 
response to a lawsuit by the Human Rights 
Defense Center — allowed the restrictive 
mail policy to stand. In September,  JDI joined 
with several other prisoners’ rights groups in 
filing an amicus brief encouraging the court 
of appeals to reverse the district court’s ruling 
— and to allow prisoners to send and receive 
the letters that they so desperately need. 
In the brief, JDI and our partners take aim 
at the jail’s policy of limiting inmate corre -
spondence to just postcards. Needless to say, a 
postcard is ill-suited for sharing sensitive in -
formation. Prisoner rape survivors reach out 
to us because they feel safe doing so — but 
that sense of safety is lost when a survivor 
can only communicate using a flimsy 5 1/2 x 
8 1/2 piece of cardboard and no envelope. The 
Baxter County jail ban also covers printed 
materials that are vital to survivors’ wellbeing. 
If an inmate at the jail were to contact JDI, 
we would be prohibited from sending them 
our Hope for Healing  booklet — a self-help 
resource that is tailored for survivors of rape 
behind bars.
This isn’t the first time a detention facility has 
curtailed survivors’ ability to reach outside 
help. A few years back, we received a postcard 
from an inmate at the Maricopa County jail, 
which had instituted a similar ban to Bax -
ter County’s. The postcard contained a brief, 
chilling cry for help; one can only imagine 
what he would have written in a letter. JDI 
staff, working closely with officials at the 
Maricopa jail, were able to change the policy 
so that survivors can reach out confidentially 
to advocates on the outside. 
The court of appeals will issue a ruling in the 
Baxter County case in the coming months. 
Whatever the outcome, JDI will continue to 
fight for the rights of prisoners to connect 
with their families, and with places where 
they can get help, like JDI.f you were to ask  a sexual abuse sur -
vivor about their healing process, chances 
are they’d talk about the people in their 
emotional support network — parents, 
spouses, best friends, counselors. 
Survivors of prisoner rape depend on the 
same networks for support. But instead of 
getting help in person, the primary way for 
many inmates to get help is by writing letters. 
Survivor Council member Joe Booth credits 
letters with saving his life. As he put it, “JDI 
held my hand through the mail. Without 
them, I’m not sure I would have made it.”  
Letters may seem desperately old-fashioned 
to those of us on the outside — but for pris -
oners, they are a lifeline. They are safer and 
more reliable than other options for sharing 
deeply personal information. Visits from fam -
ily and friends are often held in noisy public 
areas of the prison, monitored by staff, and 
limited to one hour — hardly an ideal setting 
to talk about trauma. Phone calls (other than 
with an attorney) are monitored or recorded, 
and the cost exorbitant; email access is be -
coming more common, but emails, like phone 
calls, are never private unless exchanged with 
an attorney. The sheer number of handwrit -
ten letters that JDI receives — roughly 2,000 
every year, and often 5-6 pages long — is a JDI Is Fighting Back Against a Jail’s Dangerous “Postcard-Only” Policy
Survivor Council member Joe Booth corresponded ex -
tensively with JDI while he was in prison. “JDI held 
my hand through the mail. Without them, I’m not sure 
I would have made it."I

4 1Shamefully, the response of CBP’s top 
brass has been to pass the buck. Every 
new scandal that comes to light — the 
agent who leveraged his position of power 
to target the mother of a boy in his care; 
the facility where staff openly mocked a 
gay detainee; the secret CBP Facebook 
group where rape jokes were being shared 
regularly — is dismissed as the work of “a 
few bad apples.”
This defense is the stock and trade of 
weak corrections officials. Good leaders 
recognize that it is their duty to crack 
down on unprofessional conduct — that 
a “bad apple” is not just a workplace 
nuisance, but an indicator of a larger 
problem that must be addressed. 
CBP is not the only federal agency that is 
falling short in its mission to ensure the 
safety and dignity of  children.  In February, 
it was revealed that the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS), 
which houses unaccompanied migrant 
children after their release from CBP 
custody, had received thousands of reports 
of sexual abuse. 
Like their counterparts at CBP , the top 
officials at HHS have been quick to point 
fingers elsewhere. One HHS official, 
during questioning before Congress, 
tried to downplay the problem by 
noting that the abuse in HHS shelters 
was committed either by other children 
or by contract workers — as if that 
fact somehow absolved his agency, or 
diminished the trauma of the children 
who were victimized. 
It is possible to end the sexual abuse of 
migrant children in detention, and it is 
the government’s job to do so. But agency  
leaders have proven again and again that 
they are not up to task. 
When the government takes away 
someone’s freedom, it takes on an 
absolute responsibility to keep that 
person safe. If it cannot do so, then it 
must stop detaining them.  action  update                     
DI has reviewed thousands of Prison 
Rape Elimination Act (PREA) audit 
reports over the past few years. What 
we found was deeply troubling. Many 
reports failed to examine corrections practices 
and simply regurgitated written policy; others 
heaped praise on facilities that were doing the 
bare minimum to protect people from rape, if 
even that much. 
But even by these pitiful standards, the au -
dit of the Metropolitan Detention Center 
(MDC) in Brooklyn, New York, stood out. 
The federal prison is among the worst facili -
ties in the nation — a cesspool with a lengthy 
history of staff sexual misconduct. MDC is, 
in other words, exactly the kind of prison that 
needs outside scrutiny. 
But none of MDC’s problems made it into the 
PREA audit. Per the final report, the facility 
was well run, the staff were committed, and 
the inmates safe. Never mind that days before 
the audit three officers had been charged with 
raping at least six inmates. Based on the audit, 
you’d think MDC was a model institution. 
Clearly, the MDC auditor had no business 
conducting prison assessments. And now, 
thanks to JDI, he won’t be doing any more 
of them. Terrible auditors are finally being 
decertified for cause — meaning that they 
cannot ever again evaluate a prison or jail’s ef -
forts to keep inmates safe from sexual abuse. 
It also means that the good auditors — the We’re Fighting for Stronger Prison 
Oversight. And It’s Working. Release Migrant 
Children
ones who care about prisoner safety — can 
step up to provide the meaningful oversight 
that is needed.
The removal of shoddy PREA auditors is the 
result of a law that JDI helped pass last year to 
repair the prison monitoring system. Known 
as the Parole Commission Extension Act, in 
addition to requiring substandard auditors to 
be decertified, the law helps ensure that peo -
ple who aren’t cut out for the role don’t get 
certified as PREA auditors in the first place.  
Among those who have been dropped from 
the ranks is the auditor who was contracted to 
assess many of Florida’s prisons. From read -
ing that auditor’s reports, you would never 
know that Florida runs arguably one of the 
most dysfunctional state prison systems in the 
country. In July 2016, the auditor determined 
that at the Century Correctional Facility 
(CCF) there was “no retaliation against any 
inmate or staff member who reported sexual 
abuse or sexual harassment.” 
That finding would have seemed odd to Rob -
ert*, a CCF prisoner who was sexually abused 
by a staff member. When he told a lieutenant 
what happened, she called him a liar and cau -
tioned him to “to watch [his] every step for 
messing with one of ‘her’ officers.”
Now, through JDI's advocacy, the people in 
charge of monitoring are better equipped to 
make sure prisoners, like Robert, are safe.

Isak Takes Off the Mask Meet our Newest 
Survivor Council 
Members! 
In the groundbreaking documentary Taking Off the Mask , prisoner rape survivor and human rights 
advocate Isak Sass talks about his journey to healing. (Photo still from Taking Off the Mask /JDI-SA 
and Azania Rizing Productions)
For a long time, Isak Sass  did not 
use his real name when talking about 
being sexually abused in a South Afri -
can prison. Isak had good reason to 
avoid exposure. As in the US, prisoner rape 
survivors in South Africa are often made to 
feel like the abuse was their fault. The inten -
sity of the stigma around sexual violence was 
made clear to Isak when he tried to speak out 
while locked up. No one lifted a finger to help: 
a guard laughed in his face, the prison nurse 
told him to “wash his stinking body,” a priest 
told him to repent, and the judge presiding 
over his case told him that rape was a fact of 
life in prison and that he should get used to it.
But in recent years, Isak has grown more com -
fortable talking about the assaults. He found 
that opening up to people he trusted, like the 
team at JDI-South Africa ( JDI-SA), helped 
him process difficult feelings. It also became 
clear to Isak that by speaking out, he could 
help shift people’s negative attitudes toward 
prisoner rape survivors. Eventually, Isak 
started appearing at JDI-SA advocacy events, 
sharing his story with reporters, policymakers, 
and even corrections officials. 
And now, Isak is telling his story to the world. 
This summer, JDI-SA premiered a ground -
breaking documentary about Isak called Tak-
ing Off the Mask.  Co-produced by JDI-SA and 
Azania Rizing Productions, the documentary traces Isak’s long, and ongoing, journey to 
healing — and the pivotal role of advocates 
who are helping him along the path. “I was 
always blaming myself for what happened to 
me,” Isak says in the film. “JDI helped me 
come to the conclusion that it wasn’t me, it 
wasn’t my fault.”
Taking Off the Mask was screened in Johan -
nesburg on July 18 — Nelson Mandela Day 
in South Africa — before a standing-room-
only crowd. For most of the people there, the 
film was their first time seeing a person talk 
about being raped in prison. “Isak’s vulner -
ability, and his willingness to share such a 
traumatic experience, is remarkable,” said one 
attendee. “I feel so grateful for his bravery.” 
The film’s reach will extend far beyond that 
packed theater. JDI-SA will show Taking 
Off the Mask  at workshops aimed at teaching 
corrections officials how to deal compassion -
ately with survivors. And the Judicial Inspec -
torate for Correctional Services — South 
Africa’s pris on watchdog — plans to share it 
with its staff. 
The widespread embrace of the film is exactly 
what Isak hoped for. While he can’t undo the 
trauma he endured, his goal is to make the 
public understand that prisoner rape is a dev -
astating crime, and that it is up to all of us to 
stop it. P

the border, children are living a 
nightmare. They are being held in 
cages, with no access to showers, 
toothpaste, or clean clothes. Food is often 
so scarce that kids go to bed hungry. 
These conditions, while horrific in their 
own right, hint at an even deeper human 
rights crisis. In a recent op-ed for the 
Houston Chronicle , JDI Executive 
Director Lovisa Stannow spotlights the 
rampant sexual abuse and harassment 
inside Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) facilities. There have been scores of 
reports of sexual assault against children 
in CBP custody — and those are just the 
cases that we know about. Considering It’s Time to Release Migrant 
Children from Custody 
Customs and Border Protection is holding scores of migrant children in nightmarish facilities — 
including the one pictured above, in McAllen, Texas. If the agency cannot protect the children in its 
custody, then it must release them. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)See Release Migrant Children, continued on page 2

Ithat kids typically don’t report abuse in any 
setting — let alone when they’re locked up, 
and the adults in charge don’t care enough to 
give them adequate food or soap — the true 
scale of the problem is unfathomable.  
The failure to keep migrant children safe 
should not come as a surprise. Sexual abuse 
thrives in detention facilities that are badly 
run — and the agencies that hold migrant 
children are a case study in poor leadership. 
Top immigration officials have done 
little to rein in toxic staff culture. Sexism, 
homophobia, and anti-migrant views are 
rampant among the rank and file. Speaking 
out against a fellow agent is taboo; under the 
“green code,” loyalty to the uniform is prized 
above all else, including human rights. Our Immigration Detention System is Broken — 
and Children are Suffering as a Result
Maricopa inmates used to have to write 
on postcards, like the one above.action  update                      
When You’re Locked Up, a Letter Is a Lifeline
testament to the importance of written cor -
respondence in survivors’ healing. 
So when it came to light that a jail in Baxter 
County, Arkansas, had made it virtually im -
possible for survivors to send or receive let -
ters, we were deeply alarmed. Our concerns 
intensified when a federal district court — in 
response to a lawsuit by the Human Rights 
Defense Center — allowed the restrictive 
mail policy to stand. In September,  JDI joined 
with several other prisoners’ rights groups in 
filing an amicus brief encouraging the court 
of appeals to reverse the district court’s ruling 
— and to allow prisoners to send and receive 
the letters that they so desperately need. 
In the brief, JDI and our partners take aim 
at the jail’s policy of limiting inmate corre -
spondence to just postcards. Needless to say, a 
postcard is ill-suited for sharing sensitive in -
formation. Prisoner rape survivors reach out 
to us because they feel safe doing so — but 
that sense of safety is lost when a survivor 
can only communicate using a flimsy 5 1/2 x 
8 1/2 piece of cardboard and no envelope. The 
Baxter County jail ban also covers printed 
materials that are vital to survivors’ wellbeing. 
If an inmate at the jail were to contact JDI, 
we would be prohibited from sending them 
our Hope for Healing  booklet — a self-help 
resource that is tailored for survivors of rape 
behind bars.
This isn’t the first time a detention facility has 
curtailed survivors’ ability to reach outside 
help. A few years back, we received a postcard 
from an inmate at the Maricopa County jail, 
which had instituted a similar ban to Bax -
ter County’s. The postcard contained a brief, 
chilling cry for help; one can only imagine 
what he would have written in a letter. JDI 
staff, working closely with officials at the 
Maricopa jail, were able to change the policy 
so that survivors can reach out confidentially 
to advocates on the outside. 
The court of appeals will issue a ruling in the 
Baxter County case in the coming months. 
Whatever the outcome, JDI will continue to 
fight for the rights of prisoners to connect 
with their families, and with places where 
they can get help, like JDI.f you were to ask  a sexual abuse sur -
vivor about their healing process, chances 
are they’d talk about the people in their 
emotional support network — parents, 
spouses, best friends, counselors. 
Survivors of prisoner rape depend on the 
same networks for support. But instead of 
getting help in person, the primary way for 
many inmates to get help is by writing letters. 
Survivor Council member Joe Booth credits 
letters with saving his life. As he put it, “JDI 
held my hand through the mail. Without 
them, I’m not sure I would have made it.”  
Letters may seem desperately old-fashioned 
to those of us on the outside — but for pris -
oners, they are a lifeline. They are safer and 
more reliable than other options for sharing 
deeply personal information. Visits from fam -
ily and friends are often held in noisy public 
areas of the prison, monitored by staff, and 
limited to one hour — hardly an ideal setting 
to talk about trauma. Phone calls (other than 
with an attorney) are monitored or recorded, 
and the cost exorbitant; email access is be -
coming more common, but emails, like phone 
calls, are never private unless exchanged with 
an attorney. The sheer number of handwrit -
ten letters that JDI receives — roughly 2,000 
every year, and often 5-6 pages long — is a JDI Is Fighting Back Against a Jail’s Dangerous “Postcard-Only” Policy
Survivor Council member Joe Booth corresponded ex -
tensively with JDI while he was in prison. “JDI held 
my hand through the mail. Without them, I’m not sure 
I would have made it."I
