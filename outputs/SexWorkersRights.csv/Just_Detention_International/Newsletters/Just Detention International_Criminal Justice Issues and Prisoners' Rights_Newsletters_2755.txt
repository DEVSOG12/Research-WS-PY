Until recently , Joe Booth 
wouldn’t have believed that any 
official, let alone governor, was 
willing to do much to protect 
prisoners. Five years ago, Joe was assault-
ed by his cellmate in a California prison. 
Traumatized, he reached out to state and 
law enforcement officials, begging for 
help. But his pleas were ignored.
“I was raped and tortured in my cell for 
four straight days. Yet no one seemed to care — not the prison staff, not the police, 
and no one in Sacramento,” said Joe. “It’s 
like they pretended that I didn’t exist.”
However, thanks to JDI’s advocacy, states 
are finally starting to take responsibility Rick Was Wrong: JDI Defends 
PREA from Shameful Campaign
Ivory Mitchell (left), a survivor of prisoner rape in Texas, is appalled by Governor Rick Perry’s  
decision to reject the PREA standards and abdicate his responsibility for inmate safety.See Shameful Campaign, continued on page 2T n May, Texas Governor Rick Perry 
tried to derail one of JDI’s biggest vic-
tories: the passage of strong Prison Rape 
Elimination Act (PREA) standards to 
address sexual abuse in detention. In a bla-
tant act of politi-cal theater, Perry 
refused to adopt 
the standards in Texas prisons — 
and, worse still, 
explicitly tried to get other states 
to join him.
What Governor 
Perry did not 
count on was the massive outcry 
led by JDI supporters. Displaying your soli-darity with inmates, thousands joined JDI’s 
campaign to end state rape in Texas. The press 
also chimed in, with scathing editorials in the New York Times and Washington Post. Thanks 
to this pressure, the vast majority of state gov-
ernors chose to commit to PREA rather than follow Perry’s lead.  
Rick Perry’s cynical stance on PREA is espe-
cially tragic considering that Texas prisons are 
among the most violent in the country. Ivory 
Mitchell (pictured right) recently reminded all of us at JDI why our work is not yet fin-
ished. Ivory was abused in a Texas prison, 
and then punished for filing a report. “I was locked up in Texas, but that does not mean I 
didn’t have the right to be safe,” he told JDI.
JDI will keep fighting to ensure that every 
state — even Texas — embraces its absolute 
responsibility to protect inmates. With your continued support, we know we’ll succeed.

for the safety of people like Joe. In May, 42 
governors — including California Governor 
Jerry Brown — gave an assurance to the U.S. 
Department of Justice that they will comply with the national standards mandated by the 
Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). Two 
states — New Jersey and Delaware — certi-
fied that they already are in full compliance 
with the standards.
Shamefully, six governors chose cowardice 
and political posturing over inmates’ safety and rejected the PREA standards. Notably,

In a Victory for Advocates, and a Rebuke to Texas Governor Rick 
Perry, 44 States Formalize their Support for PREA Standards  We have all seen the recent 
media coverage of children 
crossing the U.S. border, often 
fleeing unimaginable horrors.  
In their home countries — chiefly El Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras — gang violence 
is rampant, and sexual abuse has reached 
epidemic levels. JDI has been working for 
more than two years to make sure that, once they reach the U.S., these kids are treated 
with respect and protected from sexual abuse 
while in U.S. custody.
Sadly, the agency primarily in charge of these 
kids’ safety — the Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) — is utterly 
failing to respond meaningfully to the crisis of sexual abuse of children in its care. A recent 
Houston Chronicle article uncovered more 
than one hundred documented cases where staff allegedly sexually abused kids in HHS 
custody. The total number of undocumented 
assaults is certainly far, far higher.
Sexual abuse can cause children a lifetime of 
pain. Many adults who were sexually abused 
as children suffer from addictions, depression, 
and post-traumatic stress disorder. Elvin, Children Abused in U.S. Custody
Wa Honduran teen who in 2010 was sexually assaulted by a staff member at a Texas shelter, 
told the Chronicle that he still suffers from 
nightmares. “I wake up and he is at my bed. And it is happening again,” he said. 
The abuse endured by untold numbers 
of children, like Elvin, is fundamentally 
unacceptable — and it can be stopped. In 2013, JDI and its allies successfully worked 
with Congress to mandate that HHS issue 
Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) standards. These rules have the potential to 
protect young people from sexual abuse, yet 
HHS blew right past its deadline to finalize 
them. At the time of this writing, HHS has 
yet to publish its PREA standards. 
Even worse, there is little evidence that the 
agency is taking reports of widespread sexual abuse in these facilities seriously. In response, 
JDI and more than 800 supporters sent HHS 
Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell a petition demanding that HHS finalize and swiftly 
implement its PREA standards. 
Thank you, JDI supporters, for standing up 
for every child’s right to be safe!JDI Welcomes New 
Board Members 
Jdi is thrilled to announce that Jan 
Lastocy and Melinda LeMoine have 
joined its Board of Directors. Jan and 
Melinda bring different sets of skills, 
but share a deep commitment to ending 
sexual abuse behind bars. 
Jan Lastocy is a leading advocate for pris-
oners’ rights. In 1998, while serving time in a Michigan state prison, Jan was raped 
repeatedly over seven months by her work 
supervisor. Since joining JDI’s Survivor Council in 2010, Jan has given interviews 
to national media outlets and has been a 
frequent guest speaker at JDI trainings and 
conferences across the country. 
Melinda LeMoine is a partner at the law 
firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los An-
geles. Melinda has done extensive pro bono work on behalf of prisoners, including as 
the counsel for prisoners on death row in 
Louisiana and Nevada. She served for sev-eral years on the Board of Directors for the 
Action Committee for Women in Prison, a 
nonprofit organization.J
Federal Government Failing to Protect Unaccompanied  
Immigrant Kids from Staff Sexual Abuse
The tens of thousands of immigrant kids in HHS custody are vulnerable to sexual abuse. JDI is at the 
forefront of the effort to ensure their safety.
Photo: Pool/Getty Images News/Getty ImagesThe movement to end prisoner 
rape is full of heroes — survivors 
who are setting their own comfort, 
even safety, aside to help protect the 
rights of others. There are also entirely unex-
pected champions, like Matthew Marchetta. 
An auto mechanic 
from Southern Cal-ifornia, Matthew 
spent five years in 
state prison. He didn’t fit the pro-
file of a vulnerable 
inmate, he never 
felt threatened, and 
he certainly didn’t think of himself as a 
human rights advo-
cate. But when an opportunity came to lead a workshop about the Prison Rape Elimina-
tion Act (PREA), he jumped at it. 
“I came to prison thinking that I’d just do 
my time and go home,” explained Matthew. 
“But when I learned how common sexual 
abuse is, I got motivated to do something. 
Even though I wasn’t a target, it seemed aw-ful that people were being preyed upon and 
not getting any help.”
Matthew’s PREA workshop was part of a 
groundbreaking inmate education program 
launched by JDI. The program offers proof of what JDI has long known: prisoners them-
selves are critical to the effort to end prisoner 
rape. At first, not many inmates took Mat-thew’s class seriously. Some of them would 
shoot him angry looks during class, or even 
out in the yard. But after a few sessions, 
something amazing happened: inmates be-
gan reaching out to Matthew for help, and attitudes really started to shift. Staff also be-
gan taking reports of sexual abuse seriously, 
and sexual harassment dropped dramatically.   
“It’s kind of hard to believe that these classes 
turned around an entire prison — but that’s 
exactly what happened,” Matthew said. “It 
feels pretty great to be a part of something that has changed people’s lives.”

Prisoner rape survivors in Texas who write 
to JDI — as hundreds do, every year — paint 
a harrowing picture of life behind bars. Ivo-
ry Mitchell, released just a few months ago 
from a Texas prison, was sexually abused re-peatedly by a staff member. His abuser was 
eventually convicted, but Ivory faced years 
of retaliation from other staff. 
“Governor Perry says that PREA isn’t nec-
essary, but he’s just plain wrong,” Ivory told 
JDI. “The assaults and years of retaliation that I suffered in a Texas prison are proof of 
how badly the state needs PREA.”
Perry’s decision is a disgrace. He also tried 
to persuade other states to oppose the stan-
dards. Thankfully, the vast majority of gov-
ernors ignored Perry; only Arizona, Florida, 
Idaho, Indiana, and Utah joined him in opt-
ing out of PREA.

TJDI Video Shows Youth that  
“Staying Safe Ain’t Snitching”  
P ablo, a teenage resident at a 
New York City youth facility, feels 
trapped. A staff member has been 
touching him but he’s scared to re-
port. He doesn’t want to be a snitch. Pablo’s 
friend Will urges him to come forward; it’s 
about safety, Will says, not about snitching. 
“If you don’t say anything, she’s just going 
to keep on doing it,” he warns. Pablo takes Will’s advice to heart and, after telling a staff 
member he trusts, the abuse stops.
Pablo and Will are characters in “Safe is 
Safe,” a new educational video for youth 
detainees in New York City. Even though 
the dialogue is made up, it is based on real 
experiences of kids behind bars. JDI and its collaborators on the film — Children’s Cen-
ter for Law and Policy (CCLP), New York 
City’s Administration for Children’s Servic-es (ACS), and a graduate television produc-
tion class from Brooklyn College — knew 
that the video’s messages about safety would stick only if the characters and their dialogue 
rang true.
“When most kids hear ‘educational vid-
eo,’ they tune out,” said Chris Daley, JDI’s Deputy Executive Director, who heads up 
the project. “We wanted a video that got the 
message across but that didn’t take itself too seriously — no easy task given that we are talking about preventing sexual violence. We 
knew that if we thought like traditional ad-
vocates, the video wouldn’t land. We needed to develop something as close to a youth pro-
duction as possible.”
To find the right tone, the production team 
sought out advice from youth detainees themselves. With draft scripts in hand, resi-
dents of ACS’ secure detention facility in 
Brooklyn participated in a “table-read,” an exercise that’s more common on a film set 
than in a juvenile detention center. “After that 
first read-through, it was clear that we had to 
rework the language and add some story ele-
ments to make it more realistic,” said Daley.
Before the end of the year, “Safe is Safe” will 
be shown to current and incoming residents in the city’s secure and non-secure youth fa-
cilities. These kids will also get an educational 
pamphlet that uses characters from the video. One of the pamphlets features a text mes-
sage conversation between Pablo, who is be-
ing sexually harassed, and his friend Krystal. 
In one of her texts, Krystal perfectly captures 
a core JDI belief: “Staying safe ain’t snitch-ing.” JDI and its partners on this project look 
forward to that idea taking hold in all youth 
facilities across the city. P
In New York City, youth detainees are learning about sexual abuse prevention through innovative  
materials, like the above pamphlet, that were created by JDI and its partners, including kids in detention.plementing them (see map below). These officials recognize that it is their job to pro-
tect inmates; they know first-hand that the 
standards are an essential tool in creating safe facilities. Indeed, they understand that 
the PREA standards represent nationally 
accepted best practice within the correc-
tions community. 
Despite the decision of the “shameful six,” 
the widespread acceptance of the PREA 
standards is a huge victory. As Joe put it, “I never thought I’d see the day that Califor-
nia would commit to keeping prisoners safe. 
We haven’t ended prisoner rape, but we will, 
and I won’t stop fighting until we do.”

failing to respond meaningfully to the crisis of sexual abuse of children in its care. A recent 
Houston Chronicle article uncovered more 
than one hundred documented cases where staff allegedly sexually abused kids in HHS 
custody. The total number of undocumented 
assaults is certainly far, far higher.

nightmares. “I wake up and he is at my bed. And it is happening again,” he said. 
The abuse endured by untold numbers 
of children, like Elvin, is fundamentally 
unacceptable — and it can be stopped. In 2013, JDI and its allies successfully worked 
with Congress to mandate that HHS issue 
Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) standards. These rules have the potential to 
protect young people from sexual abuse, yet 
HHS blew right past its deadline to finalize 
them. At the time of this writing, HHS has 
yet to publish its PREA standards. 
Even worse, there is little evidence that the 
agency is taking reports of widespread sexual abuse in these facilities seriously. In response, 
JDI and more than 800 supporters sent HHS 
Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell a petition demanding that HHS finalize and swiftly 
implement its PREA standards. 
Thank you, JDI supporters, for standing up 
for every child’s right to be safe!JDI Welcomes New

to national media outlets and has been a 
frequent guest speaker at JDI trainings and 
conferences across the country.
