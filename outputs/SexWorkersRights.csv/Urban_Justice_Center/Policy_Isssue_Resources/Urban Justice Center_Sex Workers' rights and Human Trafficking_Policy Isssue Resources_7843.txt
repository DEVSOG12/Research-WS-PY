We aim to create a sexually liberated world where all workers have the autonomy and power to fully enjoy their human rights.One of the first programs in the nation to assist survivors of human trafficking, the Sex Workers Project has pioneered an approach to service grounded in human rights, harm reduction and in the real life experiences of our clients.

We share our expertise through legal education workshops for sex workers, trainings for service providers and community organizations.
