Our attorneys help clients remain in stable housing, access safer working conditions and employment options, protect their legal rights in family court, clear their criminal records, secure legal immigration status, and fight police misconduct and hate crimes. Our social workers provide long term supportive therapy and case management, creating best practices for an emerging field.We share our expertise through legal education workshops for sex workers and trainings for service providers and community organizations. We engage in media advocacy, support sex worker-led organizing and pursue policy change, aiming to make a real and demonstrable impact in the lives of our constituents. And we conduct groundbreaking human rights documentation rooted in the real life experiences of sex workers and survivors of trafficking.The Sex Workers Project is a remarkably effective, dynamic organization deeply committed to improving the lives of our clients.
