Cover photo by John MooreFriends,
This has been a dark year for our country, and for the world. I won’t sugarcoat it: 
I believe our democracy is endangered. New regimes of cruelty are tearing families 
apart at our borders, while the old signs of fascism have gained new life in streets 
and statehouses around our great country. But in the face of these terrible forces, 
new forms of resistance are blossoming, and the Urban Justice Center is dedicated 
to helping them grow. For the last three decades, we’ve supported cutting edge 
legal projects, but today, we’ve made it our official mission: 
We provide a platform for dynamic advocates to fuel social change, 
leading the way for a just, fair, and decent society.
What does this mean? Well, for one thing, it means that we are gearing up 
to launch up to five new Projects in 2019, each focusing on an underserved 
community in danger. Through our new Social Justice Accelerator, we’re inviting 
the next generation of change makers and thought leaders to become part of the 
Urban Justice Center. We’re also helping some of the Projects we’ve nurtured 
throughout the years spin off and become full-fledged organizations of their own. 
Although they will no longer be under our roof, we know that the Community 
Development Project and the International Refugee Assistance Project will 
continue to do incredible work, and we are excited to stand beside them in 
doing it.
It also means that we’ve embraced a new look, as you’ll see throughout these 
pages. As our long-term supporters, you’ll be some of the first to get a peek at our 
new logo, colors, and design. We were guided through this process by incredible 
pro-bono work of the branding firm Superunion, and I’m certain you’ll love the 
results as much as we do.
Of course, this new look doesn’t mean that the core of our services has changed. 
We still defend the individual rights of our clients, be they survivors of intimate 
partner violence or homeless LGBTQ youth. We are still building inclusive 
communities, empowering people around the city (and the country) to come 
together and fight for their rights. And we’re still pursuing the long game of 
systemic change in order to make our government uphold the rights that each of 
us are promised in the Constitution: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
In the face of impending fascism, justice is just us – the community of those who 
will step up and resist. We’re so glad to have you on our side. Thank you for your 
support yesterday, today, and most crucially, tomorrow.OUR STRATEGY

DEFENDING
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
In 1989, 17-year-old Heath Phillips was a fresh-faced Naval recruit, 
eager to serve his country. Once on his assigned ship, however, 
he was sexually and physically assaulted by a group of six other 
sailors. Despite repeated reports to his superiors, Heath was 
given no support or chance to transfer. After 48 days of unending 
assault, he escaped – only to be arrested, returned, and assaulted 
again. Four more times, Heath ran away only to be returned to 
his attackers. Heath went AWOL one final time, beginning nearly 
two decades of alcohol abuse and PTSD, with no support from 
Veterans Affairs. 
 
After nearly ending his life, Heath got sober. Unlike many 
survivors of sexual violence, he began to tell his story publicly. 
Advocating for survivors became his mission. 
 
Three times he applied to have his discharge status upgraded, so he 
could access the life-saving services he desperately needed; three 
times, the Navy denied him. That’s when Heath became a client 
of our Veteran Advocacy Project, who worked with him for years 
on a fourth application, and finally convinced the Navy that he 
deserved an honorable discharge. Thanks to Heath’s persistence 
(and the assistance of our lawyers and advocates), justice was 
finally served.SUPPORTING SURVIVORS

Andrea, ASAP ClientLong before the Trump administration began their 
cruel policy of separating asylum-seeking children from 
their parents, our Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project 
(ASAP) was providing representation to families in 
some of the most ignored areas in the country. Without 
representation, according to one study, asylum seekers 
win their cases less than 3% of the time.
 
ASAP knew that many Americans want to help 
immigrants fleeing danger, so based on their experience, 
they developed a guide:  “Vindicating the Rights of 
Asylum Seekers at the Border and Beyond: A Guide to 
Representing Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal 
and Reinstatement of Removal Proceedings.”  This guide 
is yet another way in which ASAP is strengthening the 
country-wide community of progressive advocates, while 
protecting marginalized immigrants at the same time. By 
empowering asylum seekers and their supporters, ASAP 
is building a powerful coalition to resist the Trump 
administration’s attacks on vulnerable families.ADVOCATING FOR ASYLUMFUELING
SYSTEMIC CHANGE

For years, prisoners in New York City have been charged exorbitant fees to make 
phone calls, creating millions of dollars in profit not just for prison telecom 
companies, but also for our city government, which raked in over $5,000,000 
annually on the backs of imprisoned people and their communities. To those in 
jail, these calls are a literal lifeline; to our government, they are an easy way to 
turn a quick buck.
 
Or at least they were until earlier this year, when our Corrections Accountability 
Project (CAP) – in concert with a coalition of concerned organizations – helped 
to pass critical legislation mandating that all calls from city jails be free, and 
prohibiting the city from profiting off them. Now New York City is the only 
jurisdiction in the nation to ban this cruel form of prison exploitation. This 
will save low-income communities of color in New York nearly $10,000,000 a 
year, but the true measure of success is knowing that imprisoned people will no 
longer be isolated from their loved ones and their only means of support, simply 
because they can’t afford the price of a phone call.OPPOSING PRISON PROFITEERING

SOCIAL JUSTICE’S CUTTING EDGE
Next year, we are excited to launch our Social Justice Accelerator 
(SJA), which will provide dynamic advocates with a home from which 
to create new and unique social justice interventions. The new ideas 
promoted by these advocates will change our world for the better. But 
they need a place to start – a safe home from which to grow; mentors 
to motivate them when the work is most difficult; and a network of 
like-minded allies to support them every step of the way.
 
That’s where we step in. For years, we have informally worked to 
uplift passionate leaders with bold visions for social justice - people 
like Coco Culhane, who was driven to create our Veteran Advocacy 
Project when she learned the staggering statistic that 20 United States 
veterans die by suicide every day, and Becca Heller, who was recently 
awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant for her groundbreaking work on 
behalf of international refugees.
 
With the SJA, we are excited to institutionalize this part of our 
mission, and fuel the next generation of social change agents.  
Recipients will be announced in February 2019. Stay in the loop by

JEROME AVENUE 
WORKERS 
PROJECT
The beautiful bordered black & white images 
throughout this report were taken by the 
incredible photographers of the Jerome Avenue 
Workers Project, an initiative of the Bronx Photo 
League at the Bronx Documentary Center.
The Bronx Photo League is made up of 16 Bronx 
photographers committed to documenting social 
issues and change in the borough. This exhibition 
celebrates the workers and trades people of 
Jerome Avenue, one of our city’s few remaining 
working class neighborhoods where many still 
make a living in small shops and factories, or 
repairing automobiles. For more information 
about the Bronx Documentary Center, please 
visit bronxdoc.org .
Earlier this year, UJC was honored to exhibit 
the original photos in our office via Art@UJC, 
our ongoing series of social justice related art 
exhibits. If you or someone you know is interested 
in exhibiting with Art@UJC, please contact 
art@urbanjustice.org .
