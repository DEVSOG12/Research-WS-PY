Edward TuranLETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR
Friends,
One of the main things that has gotten me through this difficult 
year has been seeing the incredible ways we – as people, as 
Americans, as concerned citizens of the world – have pulled 
together and taken care of one another. From the wildfires in 
California, to the dumpster fire in the White House, the crises we 
face today are far beyond the ability of any one person to solve.
That is the theme of our Annual Report for this year: lifting up the 
stories of the many, many people involved with the Urban Justice 
Center, from the staff we employ, to the activists we train, to the 
community members we work with. In these pages, you’ll meet 
the at-risk students in the Bronx who participated in a basketball 
tournament organized by Power of Purpose (part of the inaugural 
class of our Social Justice Accelerator program), which the local 
police precinct credited for preventing violence all summer 
long. You’ll meet the Safety Net Activists, a group of incredible 
volunteers – all with personal experience of homelessness and 
precarity – who have been successfully lobbying the city to make 
change on behalf of themselves and people like them. You’ll read 
about our urgent law suit, developed to protect our clients from 
being ambushed by ICE, which is supported by State Attorney 
General Tish James, among many others. And you’ll hear the 
stories of some of our most difficult cases, where our clients 
needed help that spread across many of the Projects we house.
Together, we are making a difference – and you are an important 
part of that “we.” Without your support, there would be no 
salaries for our staff, no office to train activists in, not even the 
paper on which to send you this report. Our community – my 
community – is stronger because you are in it.Only through collective action do we stand a chance.

DEFENDING  
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
Photos by Aidan Sullivan Salma with Brooke Taylor from the Mental Health Project and Rosie 
Wang from the Sex Workers ProjectOUR STRENGTH 
LIES IN OUR UNIQUE 
STRUCTURE
which empowers diverse advocates to tackle intrac -
table problems in groundbreaking ways. Each Proj -
ect sets their own course, but is united by a shared 
commitment to social justice, enabling us to defend 
individuals’ rights in ways smaller agencies can’t.
For instance, when our client Salma first came to 
our office in 2016 she had been living on the streets, 
in and out of shelters for several years. A human 
trafficking survivor, Salma was referred to our Sex 
Workers Project to get help applying for a traffick -
ing visa. SWP staff provided trauma therapy, case 
management and legal assistance until– after many, 
many meetings and applications – she won a cov -
eted T-visa. Remaining connected to SWP for con -
tinued case management support, Salma was finally 
able to move out of the city’s shelter system and into 
her own supportive housing apartment. However, 
the toll and trauma of the trafficking and years of 
homelessness, transphobia and violence Salma en -
dured, manifested in severe PTSD symptoms and 
prevented her from being able to secure employ -
ment in the formal economy. 
Salma initiated her own application for disability 
benefits and UJC’s Mental Health Project quickly 
added their expertise to the fight, joining Salma’s 
interdisciplinary team, and collaborating with SWP 
to educate the Social Security Administration about 
T-visa holder’s eligibility and Salma’s mental health 
disability. Months of tireless holistic advocacy from 
the team and dogged persistence on Salma’s part  
resulted in yet another win--Salma is living safer 
and healthier now, a visa holder, in her own Brook -
lyn apartment, with life-saving Medicaid and dis -
ability benefits.“I wish there was a UJC in  
every city in the world.”

COMMUNITYPhoto by Brent StirtonAT UJC, WE BELIEVE WE ARE STRONGEST 
WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER.
In 2019 alone, the Safety Net Activists:
 ›Significantly raised awareness on how the City’s 
poorest and most vulnerable communities are 
subject to arbitrary abuse at City benefits offic -
es. As a direct result, in August 2019, the City  
Council passed an oversight package aimed at re -
quiring new training methods, improving services, 
and increasing accountability and transparency at 
the offices.
 ›Released a report that showed the harmful effects 
of “transfer” practices carried out within NYC 
shelters, revealing that homeless families and indi -
viduals are subject to arbitrary and forcible shelter 
moves across the city, often with no notice or rea -
son provided and no ability to contest the move. 
The report was covered in the New York Times.
In 2020, the Safety Net Activists will launch a new 
Know Your Rights guide, the first resource of its kind 
to provide critical information to homeless New 
Yorkers about their rights in shelter and resources 
in the difficult process of finding housing. The guide 
will be distributed to homeless New Yorkers across 
the City.For this reason, many of our Projects partner with 
others to push for systemic changes in New York City 
– often, organizing with people directly impacted by 
these issues. Not only does this grow the community 
of people advocating for social justice, it also empow -
ers community members and gives them new tools to 
create change for themselves and others. 
In 2014, the Safety Net Project and impacted com -
munity members launched the Safety Net Activists, 
a volunteer group of New Yorkers who have lived ex -
perience with poverty, homelessness, and the public 
benefits system. Jonathan Sunshine, pictured here, 
has been part of the Activists for many years. 
"Never forget that many 
superheroes were justst regular 
people before their circumstances 
transformed them and made 
them what they are."

SYSTEMIC CHANGE
UJC Staff at ICE Lawsuit Rally When our client CZ went to court seeking an or -
der of protection against their abusive ex-partner, 
the last thing they expected was to be ambushed 
by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 
The American courthouse has always been a symbol 
for sanctuary, but in the last year, ICE has pervert -
ed that image, using our nation’s courts as traps to  
attack noncitizens - without judicial warrants – at 
the most vulnerable moments of their lives. As a re -
sult, CZ is terrified to return to the courthouse, and 
even considered reuniting with their abuser in order 
to survive. 
Our courts must be safe spaces for people in dan -
ger, which is why we at UJC are part of a coalition 
that is suing ICE to put a stop to these cruel raids. 
For centuries, common law has recognized that civil 
arrests in or around courthouses threaten the true 
pursuit of justice, but ICE now flagrantly disregards 
this important precedent – “a disastrous and danger -
ous break from previous policy,” as State Attorney  
General Letitia James said at the rally announcing 
our case.
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE  
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING  
ABUSED AND BEING DEPORTED.
“You can’t have true justice if you 
are afraid to go to court.”

ASKED OUR FIRST CLASS 
TO REFLECT ON WHAT 
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS 
MEANT FOR THEMAt the start of 2019, we launched our ambitious Social Justice Acceler -
ator (SJA), with a mission to find and incubate critical new initiatives 
working in the social justice sphere. Mentoring early phase projects 
(and the activists who create them), has always been a part of UJC’s 
work, but with the Accelerator, we have formalized it into regular, 
bi-yearly classes of new Projects.“ As a young executive director, the mentor -
ship and guidance provided by UJC’s leader -
ship team on everything from fundraising to 
hiring has been invaluable.”
— Katie SgarroAsylumConnect
“The UJC team has connected me to poten -
tial funders, assiststed me with the intimidat -
ing 501c3 application process, and ststrategized 
with me as I set up my organization’s pro -
gramming and services.”
— Lauren BlodgettThe Brave House
“We’ve had the invaluable opportunity to 
learn from and network with all the other 
amazing projects at UJC as we grow our cause 
and fight for social juststice.”
— Tim NeviusCollege Athletes Advocacy 
Initiative“With the support of the Urban Juststice Cen -
ter, Power of Purpose gained immediate 
credibility and has grown from an idea to a 
non-profit poised to change the lives of Bronx 
youth.”
— Jenay Nurse & Kwame ThompsonPower of Purpose (PoP)
“When I began S.T.O.P. in January, we were a dream, a name, a nd a desk in my living room. Today, 
with the help of the Urban Juststice Center we are an internati onally-recognized force for surveil -
lance reform, powered by a growing ststaff that brings lawsuit s, crafts policies, and develops software 
to protect the privacy rights of every single New Yorker.”
— Albert Fox CahnSurveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP)POWER OF PURPOSEA CLOSER LOOK AT ONE SJA PROJECT
Cha mpionship Team, Middle-School Division, PoP Top of the Hill TournamentPower of Purpose (PoP) is one of the organizations we brought in for the first class 
of the SJA. Centered in the Bronx, they aim to intervene in the lives of at-risk youth, 
before they become gang or criminally involved. With our support, they were able 
to launch a 12-week basketball tournament over the summer, when many youth 
– without other outlets – frequently find themselves in trouble. The tournament 
teams were purposely devised to include youth who were affiliated with rival gangs, 
and all youth were required to receive mentoring before and after each game. 
 
Fresh off this success, the leaders of PoP were mentored by Urban Justice staff to 
successfully apply for their first major grant, to fund a school-based mentoring pro -
gram based on the PoP curriculum. Starting in November 2019, this grant enabled 
them to launch a mentoring program for youth at the Urban Assembly Chart er 
School for Computer Science in the Bronx.
“The Top of the Hill tournament is directly responsible for having no 
shootings amongst my Housing Developments... this was a safe place 
run by the community and for the community.“
