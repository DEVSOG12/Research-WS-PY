Carlos Alexander, is a lawyer and sex worker. He became an escort to pay off his college debt, and says his salaries as a public interest nonprofit lawyer were never sufficient to get a handle on his debt.“I’ve had many clients sort of wanna rescue me, tell me they can help me get out of the work before they know that I’m an attorney. That I’m multilingual. That I’ve lived in 10 cities.” he explained. “Their sort of assumption about who does sex work is very narrow sometimes.”He also helps provide legal and social services to sex workers and survivors of sex trafficking.“The Sex Workers Project has been a leader in the national sex workers rights movement,” he stated. “You know, many of our clients are transgender women, many are undocumented, many are queer, many are people of color.”Thompson wants to dispel the myth that all sex workers are victims and said sex work is like any other job.“We often, in society and in the media, hear so much the victim narrative, around sex work. And terrible exploitative human rights abuses happen to some sex workers,” he explained. “But it’s important to note that terrible exploitative things happen in all labor sectors, and there’s nothing different about sex work other than the sexual stigma and social stigma that’s attached to it.”Thompson hopes that he can change people’s minds about what it means to be a sex workers and educate them on the complex profession.More VideosNews07/23/20Circle L Five Riding Club is Upholding the Legacy of the Black CowboyThis Texas-based riding club has been upholding the legacy of the Black cowboy for nearly 70 years.News07/23/20Meet the Original Lady AThe original Lady A is speaking out after the band formerly known as Lady Antebellum filed a lawsuit to adopt the name she’s been using for more than 30 years.News07/09/20Tina Knowles-Lawson on Passing the HEROES ActTina Knowles-Lawson, Maria Hamilton, Yvette Nicole Brown, Viola Davis, and Whoopi Goldberg are among many advocating for the HEROES Act, a bill that protects voting rights and provides additional stimulus support for those hit hardest by COVID-19.Politics07/01/20Why Does the Electoral College Still Exist?Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by nearly 3 million votes in 2016, yet Trump became president thanks to the Electoral College.News06/26/20Photographers Are Spreading Joy With Fun, Free Photoshoots This video was sponsored by Lay’sNews06/25/20Farmlink Connects Farmers With Food BanksThis video was sponsored by Lay’sNews06/25/20Everything You Need to Know About the 2020 U.S. CensusWhat is the census and why is it so important?News06/18/20Mom and Daughter Graduate Med School at the Same TimeThis mom and daughter just graduated medical school at the same time.Cookie SettingsNewsletterAdvertise With UsCareersContact UsCookie PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPressPrivacyTerms + Conditions©2022 Group Nine Media Inc.
