This same maximum and minimum sentence is available to juveniles and young adults who are disproportionately impacted by the felony-murder rule, as they are more likely to act in groups (or “co-offend”) and are more susceptible to peer pressure.Even though the US Supreme Court has established that youthful offenders lack maturity, have an underdeveloped sense of responsibility making them more reckless, impulsive, and risk-prone than adults, and are more susceptible to rehabilitation, when convicted of felony-murder, youthful offenders are branded “violent offenders” for life, and are subject to the same sentencing range as the person who “pulled the trigger.” This is true even if they personally did not inflict any harm or commit an act of violence. A conviction for felony-murder usually results in youthful offenders being sentenced to extreme periods of incarceration, including life without parole (LWOP) or de-facto LWOP.“Felony murder statutes assume that a person who participates in a felony understands the risk that someone may be killed,” says Jody Kent Lavy, executive director of the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth. “But well-established brain development science shows that children and teenagers are less able to perceive risk or anticipate consequences than adults. Given this, and children’s unique capacity for positive change, it is harsh and inappropriate to subject any child to life in prison, especially under a felony murder theory of liability.”BACKGROUNDHOW MANY PEOPLE DOES THIS IMPACT?We have no way to know. Our criminal justice data systems do not differentiate between who was convicted of first-degree murder for actually committing murder and who was a co-defendant convicted under the felony-murder rule.A STATE-BY-STATE COMPARISONIllinois previously had one of the broadest felony-murder statutes in the country. The 2021 criminal law omnibus bill, House Bill 3653, Senate Amendment 2, move Illinois to an agency theory of liability, bringing Illinois into alignment with the majority of states that still have felony-murder on the books.Forty-four states, as well as Washington, D.C. and the federal government, have codified some form of the felony-murder rule. Only 18 of those states (including the federal government) use proximate cause theory (which is what Illinois used until 2021); while 26 (including Washington, D.C.) use agency theory. In two states—Mississippi and South Carolina—it is unclear whether agency theory or proximate cause theory is utilized. California has recently restricted its felony-murder statute. Finally, six states—Arkansas, Hawaii, Kentucky, Michigan, New Hampshire, and New Mexico—do not have felony-murder statutes at all.Read more about the 2021 criminal law omnibus’ changes to Illinois’s felony-murder law.PROXIMATE CAUSE VS. AGENCY THEORYProximate Cause Theory holds defendants accountable for any foreseeable deaths that occur during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, including the deaths of innocent bystanders caused by third parties, and the deaths of co-defendants caused by police officers.Agency Theory holds defendants liable only for deaths that are caused by the defendant or co-defendants during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, thereby excluding deaths caused by third parties.POSSIBLE SCENARIOS THAT COULD LEAD TO A FELONY-MURDER CHARGE AND CONVICTION IN ILLINOISHere are some examples:Jack and Jill agree to rob a grocery store. Jack waits in the getaway car while Jill goes into the store and robs it at gunpoint. During the course of this robbery, Jill intentionally shoots and kills the store clerk. Jack and Jill both will be charged with first-degree murder, even though the death of the store clerk was not a part of the original plan.Jack and Jill agree to rob a grocery store.

Jack will be charged with first-degree murder, even though the death of Jill was caused by a police officer.In all of these scenarios, Jack could be charged with and convicted of first-degree murder even though he (1) did not possess or fire a weapon, (2) may not have known that Jill possessed a weapon, (3) was not physically present when the death occurred, (4) did not know that a death would occur, or (5) was a juvenile while Jill was an adult.WHAT OFFENSES ARE CLASSIFIED AS FORCIBLE FELONIES IN ILLINOIS?Illinois defines the following offenses as forcible felonies:robbery,burglary,residential burglary,aggravated arson,arson,aggravated kidnapping,kidnapping,aggravated battery resulting in great bodily harm or permanent disability or disfigurement,treason,first-degree murder,second-degree murder,predatory criminal sexual assault of a child,aggravated criminal sexual assault,criminal sexual assault,any other felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.HISTORY AND POLITICSThe United States is the only country in the world where the felony-murder rule still exists. The rule originated in England but was abolished there in 1957, and other common law countries soon followed. It has been a part of Illinois’ criminal laws since 1827. In 1961, the Illinois General Assembly considered whether the felony-murder rule should be eliminated, but instead of repealing the law, the legislature expanded the rule by adopting language from People v. Payne, a 1934 Illinois Supreme Court case. “In Payne, the defendant informed his accomplices that there was a large sum of money at a particular house. Acting upon that information, two armed robbers broke into the home, eventually leading to a gun battle with two brothers who lived there. One of the brothers was killed in the exchange but officials were unable to determine who fired the fatal shot.”In affirming Payne’s conviction, the Illinois Supreme Court stated:It reasonably might be anticipated that an attempted robbery would meet with resistance, during which the victim might be shot either by himself or someone else in attempting to prevent the robbery, and those attempting to perpetuate the robbery would be guilty of murder… A killing which happens in the prosecution of an unlawful act which in its consequences naturally tends to destroy the life of a human being is murder.When the Illinois General Assembly re-codified the felony-murder rule, however, it decided to incorporate even broader language than Payne in the commentary:  “It is immaterial whether the killing in such a case is intentional or accidental, or is committed by a confederate without the connivance of the defendant.., or even by a third person trying to prevent the commission of the felony.”WANT TO LEARN MORE?Eldieb, Duaa.
