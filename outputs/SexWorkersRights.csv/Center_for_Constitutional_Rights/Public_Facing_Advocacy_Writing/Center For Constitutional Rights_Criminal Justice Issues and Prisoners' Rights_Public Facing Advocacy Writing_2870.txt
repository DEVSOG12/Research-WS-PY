Garland, our case against prison isolation unitsOctober 20, 2021 Oral arguments in Aref v. Garland, our case against prison isolation units Aref v. Garland is our longstanding case challenging the Federal Bureau of Prison's Communication Management Units (CMUs). These isolation units in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Marion, Illinois, have been shrouded in secrecy since their inception as part of the post-9/11 "counterterrorism" framework implemented by the Bush administration, and remain a lesser-known tool in the “War on Terror” that inflicts serious harm on people in prison and denies them due process rights. CMUs are disproportionately used for Muslims, those with “unpopular views,” and political prisoners, who are subject to extreme isolation and restrictions on visits and communications and a lack of transparency and accountability regarding their placement in and possible removal from the special units. “Nothing will fix the damage done to my family during my years in the CMU, but a determination that my rights were violated would give me some relief…[and] it would help my children and wife come to peace with what happened to our family.” ‒ Kifah Jayyousi, plaintiff in Aref v. GarlandOral argument in Aref v. Garland took place before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  We’re pressing for information on the torture and deportation of Cameroonian refugees We filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit Wednesday demanding information about the U.S. government’s wrongful deportation of asylum seekers to Cameroon, where a civil war has displaced some 700,000 people. This FOIA lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, builds on previous requests the U.S. government disregarded and follows civil rights complaints that have gone unanswered. We joined Project South and the Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit in response to concerns from activists who have been supporting Cameroonian migrants, including members of a grassroots coalition called the Alliance in Defense of Black Immigrants. It is part of an effort to hold the U.S. government accountable for its brutal treatment of Black immigrants and to protect them from further harm. Learn more on our website.  ICYMI: Last week’s Black migrants week of action  The Black Alliance for Just Immigration held a National Week of Action in Support of Black Migrants last week to highlight the ways Black migrants are impacted by immigration policies. The Until We’re Free table, a coalition of racial and immigrant justice organizations convened by BAJI is demanding basic human rights for Black Migrants. Recently, the world saw graphic images of US border patrol agents whipping Black migrants. You have watched as the Biden administration has ignored calls to stop the deportation of about 10,000 Haitians and other Black asylum seekers. We are witnessing one of the largest mass expulsions of migrants in recent US history. The Biden administration continues to break it’s promise that racial justice will inform its policies. Learn more and read the joint letter to the Biden administration on BAJI’s website.  Upcoming Events: Lessons for Social Justice Lawyers: Michael Ratner, A Warrior for Justice; War on Terror Film Festival Lessons for Social Justice Lawyers: Michael Ratner, A Warrior for Justice Tuesday, October 26, 2021 | 4–6 p.m.Please join Hofstra Law's Monroe H.
