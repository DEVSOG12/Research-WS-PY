City of Philadelphia, asking the Supreme Court to reject a First Amendment challenge to laws that protect LGBTQIA+ people from discrimination. The case was brought by a Catholic Social Services agency that argued it should be allowed to discriminate against same-sex couples seeking to become foster parents because of the First Amendment. If the Supreme Court affirms this argument, it would allow entities to sidestep state and federal anti-discrimination laws, including laws that forbid discrimination based on race, due to religious or moral objections. Our brief urges the Supreme Court to stand with LGBTQIA+ parents and support the rule of law.Read the brief here.We're hiring! Database and Online Giving ManagerWe’re hiring!
