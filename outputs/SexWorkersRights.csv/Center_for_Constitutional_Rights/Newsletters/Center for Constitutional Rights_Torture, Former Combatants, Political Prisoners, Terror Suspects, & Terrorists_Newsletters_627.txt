Center for Constitutional Rights  
666 Broadway, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10012it. This year, we seized on the opportunity presented by 
a new president and called on the Biden administration 
to do three things: close Guantánamo Bay prison once 
and for all, provide redress to victims of the U.S. torture 
program, and dismantle the terrorism framework and 
ideologies of war, detention, and impunity. Thanks to 
your unwavering partnership, we will continue to hold 
this administration accountable as we have done with the 
previous three.
We work inside and outside the courts, with litigation  
and with advocacy. Using our “Activist-Lawyer-Storyteller” 
framework, we seek out new and often unseen 
voices through works of art that tell the stories of our 
communities and movement partners. And we don’t do 
anything alone. Our work is only possible because of 
you, our bold and steadfast supporters! Also key to our 
work is the vast network that makes up the Center for 
Constitutional Rights family: the communities we serve, 
social movements, our board members, other lawyers 
and advocates, and storytellers, whether they be artists, 
writers, or journalists. 
In this newsletter, you 
will hear from your 
fellow supporters, as 
well as our partners 
in the fight for 
justice! Thank you for 
understanding that  
the path to justice is  
not always a direct  
one, and that it is the 
relationships within the 
rich tapestry of the Center for Constitutional Rights’ family 
that make our work transformative.

our past twenty years of fighting the 
ideologies of war, xenophobia, 
and authoritarianism that 
drove the U.S. government’s 
response to 9/11, while 
also reshaping destructive 
narratives and building 
structures 
needed 
for justice, 
accountability, 
and healing.  
In those twenty years, we have defended those imprisoned 
at Guantánamo — successfully advocating for the release 
of dozens of men while demanding, time and time again, 
the prison’s closure. We have fought back against attacks 
on Muslims and immigrants, called for accountability 
for torture, and illustrated the connections between 
post-9/11 military and carceral strategies and the 
longstanding practices that have targeted Black and Brown 
communities. And we have done it all in partnership with 
marginalized communities and social movements, with 
activists and artists, and most importantly, with you, our 
donors who ensure that we have the necessary resources 
to do this crucial work together.
Yet twenty years later, the ideological commitment to 
maximum state security reflected in the so-called “War 
on Terror” is still not over, and neither is our fight against LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

We partnered with the Public Theater on  
Letters from Detention , a theatrical work by  
Jessica Blank and Eric Jensen based on letters 
between Hany Ibrahim and Yasser Ebrahim, two 
brothers and Center for Constitutional Rights clients 
who were detained in post-9/11 roundups along 
with hundreds of other Muslim, Arab, and South 
Asian immigrants based only on their race, religion, 
immigration status, and national origin. 
“Nobody tells me when I’m 
going to go home, nobody tells 
me why I am detained all 
this time for no charge.”

“Sometimes, I find myself walking 
around in my cellblock, wondering who 
these people are, why I am here, 
and where my brother is. I cannot 
believe what happened, how and why. 
The only reason why you are here,  
is that you are Muslim. That’s the  
whole story.” —Hany Ibrahim

disappearance, detention, and torture in an unprecedented

Guantánamo Bay prison in 2002, we filed Rasul v. Bush ,

men have the right to challenge their detention. The case 
opened the base that had been intended as a legal black

In 2003, Majid Khan was disappeared by the CIA and tortured 
at secret overseas “black sites” before being transferred

2006, and because, we believe, the government was so

In Rasul v. Rumsfeld , we alleged that then-Secretary 
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and the military chain of

in violation of U.S. and international law. Our clients, who 
had been imprisoned at Guantánamo, were released without 
ever being charged with a crime. 
“Solitary confinement has destroyed me...It was like 
a huge mountain that was on top of me. And the 
pressure on me was so high it squeezed tears out of my 
eyes...I had no sense of [time] passing...I was all alone 
in the world. I couldn’t find a way to stop the torture.”  
—Mohammed al Qahtani , who has been held without trial 
at Guantánamo Bay prison for more than 19 years, despite 
being entitled to a medical evaluation to determine whether 
the government may continue to detain him in light of the 
severe mental illness he suffers. We have been fighting for 
him since 2005 and we will 
persevere.   
We are currently fighting 
for five of the 39 men 
still detained at the base, 
including representing two 
at the International Criminal 
Court at the Hague. We 
are fighting for their release 
while we fight for the 
whole prison to be shut 
down. In addition to the 
cases we have fought directly, the Center for Constitutional 
Rights has organized hundreds of pro bono attorneys to 
ensure that every man imprisoned at Guantánamo had the 
opportunity to be represented by counsel. 
For more than a decade, in Al Shimari v. CACI , we have 
represented Iraqi victims of torture at the infamous Abu Ghraib 
prison in a case against a U.S.-based government contractor. It 
is a historic challenge to corporate impunity for human rights 
violations. We are one step away from a trial where our clients 
can tell their story in an American courtroom. “When we look for people fighting for  
those men...caged by our government

Photo taken by Justin NormanWriters, artists, and filmmakers help us show the real, 
human impacts of authoritarian ideologies and policies.  
We amplify our clients’ creative expression and honor the 
art of probing and resistance. We harness 
the power of 
film to educate, 
activate, and 
build community. 
Freedom Flicks  
is an ongoing screening and conversation series that 
presents award-winning, cutting-edge works about the 
political and social unrest shaping our world. We also co-
sponsored the 2021 War on Terror Film Festival, a month-
long virtual program featuring films made over the last 20 
years that document abuses, highlight crimes, and satirize 
absurdities of the so-called War on Terror. 
Art by Ghaleb Al-Bihani  and Djamel Ameziane , clients of 
the Center for Constitutional Rights, has been exhibited 
in New York City and Washington, DC. In 2022, in 
collaboration with the Tea Project, their work will be 
featured in “Remaking the Exceptional: Tea, Torture, & 
Reparations | Chicago to Guantánamo” at the Depaul

a new president and called on the Biden administration 
to do three things: close Guantánamo Bay prison once 
and for all, provide redress to victims of the U.S. torture 
program, and dismantle the terrorism framework and 
ideologies of war, detention, and impunity. Thanks to 
your unwavering partnership, we will continue to hold 
this administration accountable as we have done with the 
previous three.
We work inside and outside the courts, with litigation  
and with advocacy. Using our “Activist-Lawyer-Storyteller” 
framework, we seek out new and often unseen 
voices through works of art that tell the stories of our 
communities and movement partners. And we don’t do 
anything alone. Our work is only possible because of 
you, our bold and steadfast supporters! Also key to our 
work is the vast network that makes up the Center for 
Constitutional Rights family: the communities we serve, 
social movements, our board members, other lawyers 
and advocates, and storytellers, whether they be artists, 
writers, or journalists.

the path to justice is

Thelma Newman was not a wealthy woman, yet she made

Newman was the legal assistant to our co-founder Morty 
Stavis at the United Electrical Workers. She knew the 
fight for justice is long, and she wanted to support it even 
beyond her own lifetime.

our past twenty years of fighting the 
ideologies of war, xenophobia, 
and authoritarianism that 
drove the U.S. government’s 
response to 9/11, while 
also reshaping destructive 
narratives and building 
structures 
needed 
for justice, 
accountability, 
and healing.  
In those twenty years, we have defended those imprisoned 
at Guantánamo — successfully advocating for the release 
of dozens of men while demanding, time and time again, 
the prison’s closure. We have fought back against attacks 
on Muslims and immigrants, called for accountability 
for torture, and illustrated the connections between 
post-9/11 military and carceral strategies and the 
longstanding practices that have targeted Black and Brown 
communities. And we have done it all in partnership with 
marginalized communities and social movements, with 
activists and artists, and most importantly, with you, our 
donors who ensure that we have the necessary resources 
to do this crucial work together.
Yet twenty years later, the ideological commitment to 
maximum state security reflected in the so-called “War 
on Terror” is still not over, and neither is our fight against LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

We partnered with the Public Theater on  
Letters from Detention , a theatrical work by  
Jessica Blank and Eric Jensen based on letters 
between Hany Ibrahim and Yasser Ebrahim, two 
brothers and Center for Constitutional Rights clients 
who were detained in post-9/11 roundups along 
with hundreds of other Muslim, Arab, and South 
Asian immigrants based only on their race, religion, 
immigration status, and national origin. 
“Nobody tells me when I’m 
going to go home, nobody tells 
me why I am detained all 
this time for no charge.”  
  —Yasser Ebrahim  
“Sometimes, I find myself walking 
around in my cellblock, wondering who 
these people are, why I am here, 
and where my brother is. I cannot 
believe what happened, how and why. 
The only reason why you are here,  
is that you are Muslim. That’s the  
whole story.” —Hany Ibrahim
