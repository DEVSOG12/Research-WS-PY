Following Supreme Court vic- 
tory: Hearings must proceed 
with speed, says coordinat- 
ing judge 
 
On July 8, the federal district court 
judge overseeing the coordination of 
the habeas corpus lawsuits brought 
by the men at Guantanamo, ordered 
the Department of Justice to put 
aside their other cases and prioritize 
the men’s challenges to their deten- 
tion.   
 
``The time has come to move these 
forward,'' the judge said during the 
first hearing to follow the Supreme 
Court’s June decision in Boumediene 
v. Bush that affirmed the detainees’ 
constitutional right to habeas corpus. 
``Set aside every other case that's 
pending in the division and address 
this case first.” 
 
The judge is coordinating most of the 
approximately 200 habeas corpus 
petitions filed by the men at Guan- 
tanamo, on behalf of most of the 
district court judges in Washington, 
DC. He set the schedule for the gov- 
ernment to turn over its allegations 
against the detainees.  These cases 
are now proceeding after the end of 
a prolonged delay.  
 
 
Military commissions can 
proceed, rules judge in Ham- 
dan case 
 
On July 17, a U.S. District Judge is- 
sued a ruling refusing to delay the 
military commission of Salim Ahmad 
Hamdan, a Guantanamo detainee. Hamdan is perhaps best-known for 
his successful 2006 challenge to the 
military commissions system, in which 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
the then-existing system was invalid. 
The Military Commissions Act, 
passed in October 2006 by Con- 
gress, created a new military com- 
missions procedure. The military com- 
missions do not follow normal proce- 
dures of evidence nor provide nor- 
mal protections to defendants. 
 
The district court judge ruled that any 
review of a military commission 
should occur after, rather than be- 
fore, judgment in the military commis- 
sion. After the judge’s decision, Ham- 
dan’s military commission began on 
July 21 with Hamdan saying at the 
outset that he was not guilty of the 
charges against him.  
 
On June 30, the 21 st  detainee to be 
charged in a military commission, 
Abdel Rahim al-Nashiri, was 
charged in matters related to the 
USS Cole bombing – a matter pur- 
sued in the past in the regular U.S. 
criminal courts. Also, on July 1, an- 
other military commissions judge 
ruled that the five men charged with 
matters relating to the September 
11, 2001 attacks must receive sepa- 
rate hearings to prevent intimidation. 
 
Two Algerian men released 
from Guantanamo, held in- 
communicado for two weeks 
 
Two Algerian men held at Guan- 
tanamo were released from the de- 
tention center on July 2. Houari Ab- 
derrahmaan and Mustapha Hamlily were held for two weeks by the Al- 
gerian government with no communi- 
cation with their attorneys or families. 
They were finally released and re- 
united with their families. Hamlily was 
brought to his family’s home in an 
ambulance, due to his poor health. 
 
Both men are facing Algerian 
charges of belonging to a terrorist 
group operating abroad, charges 
based on the fact that both men left 
Algeria many years before and al- 
legedly used false passports. Both 
were cleared for release by adminis- 
trative review boards operated by 
the U.S. military at Guantanamo.  
 
Nearly 270 men remain at Guan- 
tanamo. Approximately 23 Algerians 
remain in Guantánamo.  At least five 
Algerians have explicitly expressed 
fears of repatriation due to a risk of 
torture or persecution.  An estimated 
50 Guantánamo detainees, includ- 
ing the five Algerians, cannot return 
home for fear of torture or persecu- 
tion.  So far, neither the U.S. nor 
other countries have been willing to 
give them safe haven.  In fact, the 
U.S. has already sent 40 detainees 
back to countries that are known for 
human rights abuses, including Uz- 
bekistan, Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt. 
 
Video of Omar Khadr inter- 
rogation released 
 
On July 15, videotaped recordings 
of the interrogation of Omar Khadr, 
who was brought to Guantanamo 
when he was 15 years old in 2002, 
were released by Khadr’s Canadian 
attorneys. The videotapes show a

rights 
august  2008 
Center for Constitutional Rights         www.ccrjus tice.org  (continued on  pg. 2) clearly upset and distraught Khadr 
being interrogated by Canadian 
interrogators. Khadr relates that he 
was tortured in Bagram before 
being transferred to Guantanamo 
by the U.S. military. The videos 
were released to Khadr’s attor- 
neys by a court order. 
 
On June 25, a Canadian judge 
ordered the Canadian govern- 
ment to disclose documents to 
Khadr’s attorneys that revealed 
the treatment of Khadr by U.S. 
officials in order to prepare him for 
Canadian interrogation. The judge 
then proceeded to find that this 
treatment constituted torture. He 
ultimately found that Canada is 
"implicated" in that torture since 
they proceeded with the interroga- 
tion despite knowledge that this 
torture had been inflicted.  
 
Canadian media reported that the 
documents ordered released by 
the court also revealed that Khadr 
had been subject to sleep depri- 
vation by the military at Guan- 
tanamo. Khadr was put on the so-
called “frequent flyer program,” in 
which he was moved between 
cell blocks every three hours for a 
prolonged period so that he was 
unable to sleep and maintain a 
clear sense of his surroundings.   
 
 
Ruling in Parhat case  
 
On July 1, 2008, a three-judge 
panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruled that Huzaifa Parhat 
was wrongly classified as an 
“enemy combatant.” .Parhat, a 
Guantanamo detainee of the 
Uighur Muslim ethnic minority from 
Western China, challenged his clas- 
sification as an “enemy combatant” under the Detainee Treatment Act.  
 
The court unanimously ruled that 
Parhat’s classification was based on 
bare and unverifiable claims, with- 
out evidence to back them up. The 
court directed the government to 
either release Mr. Parhat, transfer 
him to another country or conduct a 
n e w  m i l i t a r y  h e a r i n g  a t 
Guantánamo. 
 
There are currently 17 Uighur de- 
tainees at Guantanamo, who can- 
not return to China due to fear of 
persecution and torture. Five 
Uighurs were resettled in Albania in 
2006. All of Guantanamo’s Uighurs 
had been living in Uighur communi- 
ties in Afghanistan among Uighurs 
who had fled China. 
 
Judge dismisses Guan- 
tanamo attorneys’ chal- 
lenge to illegal wiretapping 
 
On July 3, a judge in the Southern 
district of New York dismissed a 
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, 
Wilner v. NSA, brought by lawyers, 
law firms, law professors and non- 
profit groups, including the Center 
for Constitutional Rights, represent- 
ing detainees at Guantanamo Bay, 
seeking records of any National 
Security Agency wiretaps of their 
client communications. The judge’s 
ruling allowed the government to 
refuse to confirm or deny the exis- 
tence of the requested records. The 
judge refused to consider the attor- 
neys’ arguments that the wiretap- 
ping program was illegal. 
 
Also, on July 13, George Bush 
signed into law the FISA Amend- 
ments Act of 2008, which provides 
immunity for telecommunications 
companies who allowed the gov- 
ernment to use its networks to con- 
duct illegal warrantless wiretapping. The law further allows for the grant- 
ing of broad, year-long wiretapping 
warrants to be used against foreign 
groups and people with only mini- 
mal assurances of protections for 
Americans whose conversations 
would be caught up in such surveil- 
lance nets. Furthermore, the new 
law also allows the government one 
week of surveillance of Americans 
without warrants before going be- 
fore the secret FISA court – which 
has only rarely denied the govern- 
ment warrants – for approval.  Law- 
suits have already been filed chal- 
lenging the new FISA law for its 
wiretapping provisions.
