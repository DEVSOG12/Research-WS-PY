Uighurs’ release into United 
States granted, then delayed 
for government appeal 
 
On October 7, 2008, a federal 
judge ordered that 17 innocent 
Uighur men imprisoned in Guan- 
tanamo be released into the United 
States. These 17 men are members 
of a Muslim minority group who face 
persecution and imprisonment if re- 
turned to their home country, China. 
The government had conceded that 
the 17 men are not properly de- 
tained and  cannot return to China.  
Yet, the government argues that a 
federal judge cannot order Guan- 
tanamo detainees released into the 
U.S. 
 
After the judge’s release order, the 
appeals court in Washington, D.C. 
granted the government’s request for 
a delay until a decision from that 
higher court.  The Uighurs’ attorneys 
are continuing to press for the 
judge’s ruling to be implemented.  
Several organizations and communi- 
ties have stepped up to offer hous- 
ing, employment and other needed 
services. 
 
Habeas hearings begin in 
Boumediene case 
 
Habeas corpus hearings in the case 
of six Bosnian men held at Guan- 
tanamo began in Washington, DC.  
The six men were arrested by the 
Bosnian government at the behest of 
the U.S., then ordered released by 
the Bosnian high court after a chal- 
lenge in 2002. Instead of being re- 
leased, the men were turned over to the U.S. and sent to Guantanamo. 
They have never been charged with 
a crime, and the U.S. government 
recently dropped allegations that the 
men were involved in a U.S. em- 
bassy bombing plot. 
 
Most of the over 200 habeas chal- 
lenges filed by the men at Guan- 
tanamo are currently before one 
judge awaiting some preliminary 
decisions about how the hearings 
will proceed.  Two judges are pro- 
ceeding independently. 
 
Guantanamo detainee seeks 
asylum in Canada and goes 
before IACHR 
 
On October 22, the Anglican Dio- 
cese of Montreal presented a refu- 
gee sponsorship petition to the Ca- 
nadian government for Guantanamo 
detainee Djamel Ameziane. 
Ameziane, who lived in Canada for 
five years and whose brother lives 
there now, is an Algerian who can- 
not return to Algeria because of a 
risk of torture or persecution. The 
U.S. government has never alleged 
that Mr. Ameziane participated in 
any act of hostilities, yet he has been 
imprisoned without charge or trial for 
nearly seven years. Also in October, 
the Inter American Commission on 
Human Rights heard Ameziane’s 
claims that the U.S. violated his 
rights.  Ameziane’s petition addition- 
ally asked the IACHR to instruct the 
United States not to return Ameziane 
to Algeria. 
 
100 Days to Close 
Guantánamo and End Tor-ture – From Witness Against 
Torture 
 
The following statement was submit-
ted to the News Briefing by grass-
roots activist group, Witness Against 
Torture, which has led efforts to close 
Guantanamo: 
100 Days to Close Guantánamo 
and End Torture  
www.witnesstorture.org/100days  
 
With a new administration taking 
office, we have a historic opportunity 
to reverse the disastrous policies of 
the last seven years. Both candidates 
have signaled a willingness to close 
the U.S. prison camp at 
Guantánamo Bay, Cuba:  
 
“We’re going to close 
Guantánamo… We’re going to lead 
by example — by not just word but 
by deed. That’s our vision for the 
future.” — Barack Obama, June 
2007  
 
“I believe we should close 
Guantánamo and work with our al- 
lies to forge a new international un- 
derstanding on the disposition of 
dangerous detainees under our con- 
trol.” — John McCain, March 2008  
 
We must not let these words remain 
mere rhetoric. We insist on action.  
 
Witness Against Torture announces 
a campaign to close the U.S. deten- 
tion facilities at Guantánamo Bay, 
Cuba, and end torture by the United 
States within the first 100 days of the 
new President’s administration.

Center for Constitutional Rights         www.ccrjus tice.org  (continued on  pg. 2) Join us in Washington, DC, as we 
mount a sustained physical pres- 
ence at the White House and or- 
ganize activities-- from film screen- 
ings to lectures and community 
meetings-- in the nation’s capital 
and across the country.  
 
We will launch the campaign with 
a nine-day fast starting January 
11, 2009, which marks seven 
years since the opening of the 
prison at Guantánamo.  
 
The 100 Days to Close 
Guantánamo campaign will for- 
mally begin on January 20, the 
inauguration of the next President, 
and continue with a regular sched- 
ule of activities for the next 15 
weeks. Join us. At the end of the 
100 Days (April 30, 2009), we 
hope to celebrate the closure of 
the detention camp at 
Guantánamo and the adoption of 
policies and laws that decisively 
ban torture by the U.S. govern- 
ment.  
 
Initiated by Witness Against Tor- 
ture, the campaign is supported by 
the Center for Constitutional 
Rights, the Torture Abolition and 
Survivors Support Coalition Inter- 
national, September 11th Families 
for Peaceful Tomorrows, United 
for Peace and Justice, the War 
Resisters League and the School 
of the Americas Watch. We wel- 
come the participation of other 
groups.

 Military Commissions Up-
dates 
 
The government dropped military 
commissions charges against five 
detainees, Binyam Mohamed, 
Noor Muhammed, Sufyiam Bar- 
houmi, Ghassan al-Sharbi and 
Jabran al-Qahtani on October 21 
after the resignation of military 
prosecutor Lt. Col. Darrel Vande- 
veld.  Vandeveld resigned, stating 
that the military was refusing to 
turn over evidence that could clear 
the men to their attorneys. Further, 
in Mohamed’s habeas case, the 
government withdrew allegations 
that he had participated in a “dirty 
bomb” plot, following an order to 
turn over certain evidence to his 
attorneys. Mohamed, a British resi- 
dent, was tortured in Morocco 
before being turned over to the 
United States. 
 
In addition, Brig. Gen. Thomas 
Hartmann is facing two investiga- 
tions into whether he abused his 
power and improperly influenced 
prosecutions. Hartmann was sup- 
posed to be both a legal adviser 
to a theoretically impartial over- 
seeing authority while maintaining 
authority over prosecutions. The 
Air Force is reviewing allegations 
that Hartmann bullied prosecutors 
and advocated using coerced 
evidence despite prosecutors' ob- 
jections. 
In other proceedings, Ali Hamza 
al Bahlul pledged to boycott his 
commission by standing silent and 
directing his lawyer to remain si- 
lent. The commission of Omar 
Khadr, the Canadian captured at 
15, has been delayed until Janu- 
ary 26 to secure an independent 
psychological assessment. The government filed charges against 
two Kuwaitis, Fouad al-Rabia and 
Faiz al-Kandari, accused of con- 
spiracy and material support for 
terrorism.
