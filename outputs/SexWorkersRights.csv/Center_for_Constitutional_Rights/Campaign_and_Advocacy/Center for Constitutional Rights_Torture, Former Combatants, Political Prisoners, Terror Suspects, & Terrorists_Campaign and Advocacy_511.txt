OFAC & Al-Aulaqi v. Obama Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: August 3, 2010Current Status The case was dismissed on December 7, 2010, on standing and because the court ruled that it raised "political questions" not subject to court review. The court did not rule on the merits of the case.Our Team:Pardiss KebriaeiMaria LaHoodPardiss KebriaeiMaria LaHoodCo-Counsel The American Civil Liberties UnionClient(s) Dr. Nasser Al-AulaqiAugust 3, 2010Case Description In June 2010, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union were retained by Nasser Al-Aulaqi, the father of Anwar Al-Aulaqi, to bring a lawsuit in connection with the government’s decision to authorize the killing of his son, a U.S. citizen who had been placed on secret “kill lists” maintained by the CIA and the U.S. military’s covert Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) earlier that year. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury designated Anwar al-Aulaqi a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist,” which made it a crime for lawyers to provide pro bono legal services for his benefit without first seeking a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  CCR and the ACLU sought a license, but after the government’s failure to grant one despite the urgency created by the outstanding authorization for Al-Aulaqi’s killing, CCR and the ACLU brought suit challenging the legality and constitutionality of the licensing scheme. The government thereupon provided the license.In August 2010, CCR and the ACLU filed suit on behalf of Nasser Al-Aulaqi, challenging the government’s decision authorizing the CIA and JSOC to target and kill his son in Yemen. Outside of the context of armed conflict, the Constitution and international human rights treaties the U.S. has ratified prohibit the state from depriving persons of life without due process, except as a last resort to protect against an imminent threat of deadly harm. Anwar Al-Aulaqi was being targeted far from the United States’ war in Afghanistan, and the standing order for his killing flew in the face of the plain meaning of the law’s imminence requirement. The district court in Washington, D.C., dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, without reaching the merits. This case is part of CCR’s work challenging unlawful drone killings by the United States and other fundamental rights violations being committed in the name of national security.Case FilesOFAC Request OFAC Complaint TRO Application PI Motion Memorandum in Support of TRO and PI Wizner Declaration OFAC Response Complaint Memorandum in Support of PI Motion Nasser Al-Aulaqi Declaration Fact Sheet Gov't Motion to Dismiss Gov't Memo Opp to Preliminary Injunction and MTD Gov't MTD - Ex 1 - Clapper Decl Gov't MTD - Ex 2 - State Secrets Policy Memo Gov't MTD - Ex 3 - Leiter Testimony Gov't MTD - Ex 4 - Gates Decl Gov't MTD - Ex 5 - Panetta Decl Plaintiffs' Opp to MTD and MSJ Declaration of Bernard Haykel Declaration of Mary Ellen O'Connell Declaration of Jonathan Manes Govt Reply re MTD Oral Argument Transcript Al-Aulaqi DecisionDOJ Memo Al-Aulaqi v.

The opinion, though, does not rule on the merits of the case and acknowledges the serious issues raised by the lawsuit. Judge Bates calls the case “unique and extraordinary,” says it presents “[s]tark, and perplexing, questions” and finds that the merits “present fundamental questions of separation of powers involving the proper role of the courts in our constitutional structure.” He, finds, however, that “the serious issues regarding the merits of the alleged authorization of the targeted killing of a U.S. citizen overseas must await another day…”Press ReleaseCourt Dismisses Targeted Killing Case On Procedural Grounds Without Addressing MeritsRelated FilesAl-Aulaqi DecisionNovember 8, 2010D.C.

In its opposition and motion, the government maintains that Nasser Al-Aulaqi lacks standing to bring the case, that the issues are political questions not appropriate for judicial review, and that litigation would risk disclosure of "state secrets." In response, CCR and the ACLU argue that Dr. Al-Aulaqi has appropriate standing to assert his son's constitutional claims, that the determination of those claims present squarely justiciable issues, that Dr. Al-Aulaqi has also stated an appropriate claim in his own right under the Alien Tort Statute against the extra-judicial killing of his son, and that "state secrets" do not foreclose litigation of his claims.Three declarations were submitted in support of the brief and the premise that the targeted killing of Dr. Al-Aulaqi’s son in Yemen would occur outside the context of armed conflict, including from Professor Bernard Haykel of Princeton University addressing factual issues concerning Yemen and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and from Professor Mary Ellen O’Connell of Notre Dame University addressing legal issues concerning armed conflict.Related FilesGov't Motion to DismissGov't Memo Opp to Preliminary Injunction and MTDGov't MTD - Ex 1 - Clapper DeclGov't MTD - Ex 2 - State Secrets Policy MemoGov't MTD - Ex 3 - Leiter TestimonyGov't MTD - Ex 4 - Gates DeclGov't MTD - Ex 5 - Panetta DeclPlaintiffs' Opp to MTD and MSJDeclaration of Bernard HaykelDeclaration of Mary Ellen O'ConnellDeclaration of Jonathan ManesGovt Reply re MTDAugust 30, 2010CCR and ACLU file suit against senior U.S. officials to challenge authorization to kill Anwar Al-AulaqiAugust 30, 2010CCR and ACLU file suit against senior U.S. officials to challenge authorization to kill Anwar Al-AulaqiThe lawsuit, on behalf of Dr. Nasser Al-Aulaqi against President Obama, CIA Director Panetta and Defense Secretary Gates, challenges their decision to authorize the targeted killing of his son, U.S. citizen Anwar Al-Aulaqi, in violation of the Constitution and international law. CCR and the ACLU also file a preliminary injunction motion, which asks the court to declare it illegal for the government to kill Anwar Al-Aulaqi unless he is found to present a concrete, imminent threat and there are no other means besides lethal force that could be used to stop the threat. While the government can legitimately use lethal force against civilians in certain circumstances outside of a judicial process, the authority claimed by senior Obama administration officials is far broader than what the Constitution and international law allow. Under international human rights law, lethal force may be used in peacetime only when there is an imminent threat of deadly attack and when lethal force is a last resort. A program in which names are added to a list through a secret bureaucratic process and remain there for months at a time plainly goes beyond the use of lethal force as a last resort to address imminent threats, and accordingly goes beyond what the Constitution and international law permit.Moreover, targeting individuals for killing who are suspected of crimes but have not been convicted – without oversight, due process or disclosed standards for being placed on the kill list – also poses the risk that the government will target the wrong people.  Since 9/11, the U.S. government has detained thousands of men as terrorists, only for courts or the government itself to discover later that the evidence was wrong or unreliable and release them.Press ReleaseRights Groups File Challenge To Targeted Killing By U.S.Related FilesComplaintMemorandum in Support of PI MotionNasser Al-Aulaqi DeclarationFact SheetAugust 4, 2010Treasury Department grants CCR and ACLU license authorizing their representation of Nasser Al-Aulaqi as representative of the interests of Anwar Al-AulaqiAugust 4, 2010Treasury Department grants CCR and ACLU license authorizing their representation of Nasser Al-Aulaqi as representative of the interests of Anwar Al-AulaqiCCR and the ACLU had submitted a request to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in July seeking authorization t0 provide pro bono legal servies to Nasser Al-Aulaqi. The OFAC requirements generally make it illegal to provide any service, including legal representation, to or for the benefit of an individual who is a Specifically Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).  A lawyer who provides legal representation for the benefit of a designated person without getting special permission is subject to criminal and civil penalties. OFAC designated Anwar Al-Aulawi as a SDGT on July 23, 2010. In early August, CCR and the ACLU filed suit against OFAC, charging that OFAC exceeded its authority by subjecting uncompensated legal services to a licensing requirement, and that OFAC’s regulations violate the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment and the principle of separation of powers.  The lawsuit asked the court to invalidate the regulations and to make clear that lawyers can provide representation for the benefit of designated individuals without first seeking the government’s consent. The next day, OFAC licensed CCR and the ACLU to represent Nasser Al-Aulaqi.Press ReleaseCCR And ACLU Receive License From OFAC to Pursue Challenge To Targeted KillingRelated ResourcesWhy We Sued to Represent Muslim Cleric AulaqiRelated FilesOFAC RequestOFAC ComplaintTRO ApplicationPI MotionMemorandum in Support of TRO and PIWizner DeclarationOFAC ResponseApril 2010U.S. reportedly authorizes killing of U.S. citizen Anwar Al-AwlakiApril 2010U.S. reportedly authorizes killing of U.S. citizen Anwar Al-AwlakiSeveral U.S. newspapers report, citing governmental officials, that the U.S. has authorized the targeted killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi.
