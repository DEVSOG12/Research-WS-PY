Fahd had been imprisoned at Guantánamo without charge since he was just 17 years old. Fourteen years later, he's finally free. Here's a clip from our short film "Waiting for Fahd", where Fahd's big brother, Mohammed, imagines their reunion. All of our efforts on Fahd’s behalf – our legal work, our advocacy, the film, everything – were made possible by your support. Thank you so much. We will continue fighting for the rest of our Guantánamo clients until the day that they, too, are finally set free.Last modified January 27, 2016The bigger pictureGuantanamoSpread the wordTweetShareEmailGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
