These findings suggest that continuing to impose lengthy prison terms will have little additional effect on deterring crime.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationOver the past several decades state and federal incarceration rates have increased dramatically. As a consequence of more punitive laws and harsher sentencing policies 2.3 million people are incarcerated in the nation’s prisons and jails, and the U.S. leads the world in its rate of incarceration.Sentencing systems and incarceration traditionally have a variety of goals, which include incapacitation, punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation. In recent decades, sentencing policy initiatives have often been enacted with the goal of enhancing the deterrent effect of the criminal justice system. Under the rubric of “getting tough on crime,” policies such as mandatory minimums, truth in sentencing, and “three strikes and you’re out” have been designed to deter with the threat of imposing substantial terms of imprisonment for felony convictions.While the criminal justice system as a whole provides some deterrent effect, a key question for policy development regards whether enhanced sanctions or an enhanced possibility of being apprehended provide any additional deterrent benefits. Research to date generally indicates that increases in the certainty of punishment, as opposed to the severity of punishment, are more likely to produce deterrent benefits. This briefing paper provides an overview of criminological research on these relative impacts as a guide to inform future policy consideration.To read this paper, download the PDF below.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationRelated PostspublicationsMay 27, 2021Letter in Support of the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and First Step Implementation ActAmy FettigIn a letter of support submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, The Sentencing Project's Executive Director Amy Fettig expressed the importance of advancing the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act (S.312) and the First Step Implementation Act (S.1014).Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesDrug PolicypublicationsFebruary 17, 2021No End In Sight: America's Enduring Reliance on Life ImprisonmentAshley NellisIn the United States, more than 200,000 people are serving life sentences – one out of every seven in prison.Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up1 in 3Black men born in 2001 can expect to go to prison in their lifetimeMore FactsTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
