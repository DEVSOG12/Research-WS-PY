References 22 4  The Sentencing ProjectWhen former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin 
killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck in 2020, the 
world witnessed the most racist elements of the U.S. 
criminal legal system on broad display. The uprisings 
that followed Floyd’s death articulated a vision for 
transforming public safety practices and investments. 
Almost one year later, Chauvin was convicted for Floyd’s 
death, a rare outcome among law enforcement officers 
who kill unarmed citizens. The fight for racial justice 
within the criminal legal system continues, however. 
The data findings featured in this report epitomize the 
enormity of the task. 
This report details our observations of staggering 
disparities among Black and Latinx people imprisoned 
in the United States given their overall representation 
in the general population. The latest available data 
regarding people sentenced to state prison reveal that 
Black Americans are imprisoned at a rate that is roughly 
five times the rate of white Americans. During the 
present era of criminal justice reform, not enough 
emphasis has been focused on ending racial and ethnic 
disparities systemwide. 
Going to prison is a major life-altering event that creates 
obstacles to building stable lives in the community, 
such as gaining employment and finding stable and 
safe housing after release. Imprisonment also reduces 
lifetime earnings and negatively affects life outcomes 
among children of incarcerated parents.1 These are 
individual-level consequences of imprisonment but 
there are societal level consequences as well: high 
levels of imprisonment in communities cause high crime 
rates and neighborhood deterioration, thus fueling 
greater disparities.2 This cycle both individually and societally is felt disproportionately by people who are 
Black. It is clear that the outcome of mass incarceration 
today has not occurred by happenstance but has been 
designed through policies created by a dominant white 
culture that insists on suppression of others.
At the same time, states have begun to chip away at 
mass incarceration. Nine states have lowered their 
prison population by 30% or more in recent years: Alaska, 
New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Alabama, Rhode 
Island, Vermont, Hawaii, and California.3 This decline 
has been accomplished through a mix of reforms to 
policy and practice that reduce prison admissions as 
well as lengths of stay in prison. Still, America maintains 
its distinction as the world leader4 in its use of 
incarceration, including more than 1.2 million people 
held in state prisons around the country.5  
Truly meaningful reforms to the criminal justice system 
cannot be accomplished without acknowledgement of 
its racist underpinnings. Immediate and focused 
attention on the causes and consequences of racial 
disparities is required in order to eliminate them. True 
progress towards a racially just system requires an 
understanding of the variation in racial and ethnic 
inequities in imprisonment across states and the 
policies and day-to-day practices that drive these 
inequities.6  
This report documents the rates of incarceration for 
whites, African Americans, and Latinx individuals, 
providing racial and ethnic composition as well as rates 
of disparity for each state.7 The Sentencing Project has 
produced state-level estimates twice before8  and once 
again finds staggering disproportionalities.OVERVIEWThe Color of Justice  5KEY FINDINGS
• Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons 
at nearly 5 times the rate of white Americans.
• Nationally, one in 81 Black adults in the U.S. is 
serving time in state prison. Wisconsin leads the 
nation in Black imprisonment rates; one of every 
36 Black Wisconsinites is in prison. 
• In 12 states, more than half the prison population 
is Black: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New 
Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
• Seven states maintain a Black/white disparity larger 
than 9 to 1: California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, 
Minnesota, New Jersey, and Wisconsin.
• Latinx individuals are incarcerated in state prisons 
at a rate that is 1.3 times the incarceration rate of 
whites. Ethnic disparities are highest in 
Massachusetts, which reports an ethnic differential 
of 4.1:1.RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Eliminate mandatory sentences for all crimes.
Mandatory minimum sentences, habitual offender 
laws, and mandatory transfer of juveniles to the adult 
criminal system give prosecutors too much authority 
while limiting the discretion of impartial judges. 
These policies contributed to a substantial increase 
in sentence length and time served in prison, 
disproportionately imposing unduly harsh sentences 
on Black and Latinx individuals.
2. Require prospective and retroactive racial impact 
statements for all criminal statutes.
The Sentencing Project urges states to adopt 
forecasting estimates that will calculate the impact 
of proposed crime legislation on different populations 
in order to minimize or eliminate the racially disparate 
impacts of certain laws and policies. Several states 
have passed “racial impact statement” laws. To undo 
the racial and ethnic disparity resulting from decades 
of tough-on-crime policies, however, states should 
also repeal existing racially biased laws and policies. 
The impact of racial impact laws will be modest at 
best if they remain only forward looking.
3. Decriminalize low-level drug offenses.
Discontinue arrest and prosecutions for low-level 
drug offenses which often lead to the accumulation 
of prior convictions which accumulate 
disproportionately in communities of color. These 
convictions generally drive further and deeper 
involvement in the criminal legal system.Truly meaningful reforms to the 
criminal justice system cannot 
be accomplished without 
acknowledgement of its racist 
underpinnings.

We begin with a national view of the concentration of 
prisoners by race and ethnicity as a proportion of their 
representation in the state’s overall general population, 
or the rate per 100,000 residents.9  Looking at all states 
together (Figure 1) we see that at the national level, 
Black people are incarcerated at a rate of 1240 per 
100,000 while white people are incarcerated at a rate 
of 261 per 100,000. Black Americans are incarcerated 
at 4.8 times the rate of white Americans. Nationally, 
Latinx individuals are held in state prisons at a rate of 
349 per 100,000 residents, producing a disparity ratio 
of 1.3 to 1 when compared with white non-Latinx 
Americans.10
Figure 1. Average Rate of Black, Latinx and White 
Imprisonment Per 100,000 ResidentsThe following table presents state rates of incarceration 
by race and ethnicity according to their rank from 
highest Black incarceration rate to lowest (Table 1). 
The states with the highest rate of African American 
incarceration are Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Idaho, and 
Montana. Wisconsin has the highest rate of incarceration 
among its Black residents with 2,742 per 100,000 Black 
residents in prison. This statistic is remarkable given 
that Black people comprise only 6% of Wisconsin’s 
general population. This table also presents the rate of 
incarceration for Latinx individuals, showing that it is 
highest in Arizona, where 742 per 100,000 Latinx adults 
in the state are in prison. The next highest rate of Latinx 
imprisonment is in Idaho, followed by Connecticut, 
Wyoming, and Colorado. Table 2 provides a slightly 
different view which shows the odds of imprisonment 
among Black individuals in each state given their overall 
representation in the state. THE SCALE OF DISPARITY

Massachusetts 214Table 2. Rate of Black Imprisonment 8  The Sentencing ProjectIt is important to keep in mind that the absence or 
unreliability of ethnicity data in some states produces 
ethnic disparities in those states that may be 
understated. Since most Latinx people in those instances 
would be counted in the white prison population, the 
white rate of incarceration would therefore appear 
higher, and consequently the Black/white and Latinx/
white ratios of disparity would be lower as well. Indeed, 
Alabama, Maine, Michigan, and Vermont did not report 
ethnicity figures to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics 
in 2019. In additional states the figures are very likely 
to be undercounts. An example lies in Florida, which claims that 13% of its prison population is Latinx though 
more than one quarter of its residents are Latinx. There 
are most assuredly more Latinx people in prison than 
are officially reported but the exact number is unknown. 
Due to these potential underestimates the incarceration 
rates of whites are likely inflated; similarly, in states 
with larger undercounts of Latinx individuals, the 
disparity ratio between Blacks and whites is likely to 
be underestimated.
The maps presented below (Figs. 2 and 3) provide the 
Black/white differential in incarceration rates followed 
by the Latinx/white differentials. Appendix A (Tables 7

In California, Connecticut, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, 
Maine, and Wisconsin, the rate of imprisonment among 
Black people is more than nine times that for whites. 
In an additional 13 states, the incarceration rate for 
African Americans is greater than six times the 
incarceration rate of whites. And even in the state with 
the lowest racial disparity, Hawaii, the odds of 
imprisonment for Blacks are more than twice as high 
as for whites. 
American prison populations have long been found to 
have a racial and ethnic profile that departs significantly 
from the demographics in the general population. U.S. 
Census Bureau data on incarcerated persons from 1870 
through 1980 show that Black incarceration rates have 0123+Figure 3. Latinx/white incarceration ratios

ranged from three to nine times those of whites, 
depending upon the decade and region of the country.11 
The particular drivers of disparity are known to be related 
to a mix of social policies that stretch beyond crime 
policies to those related to housing, education, receipt 
of public benefits, child care, and employment. 
Regardless of the causes, the simple presence of racial 
and ethnic disparities should be deeply worrisome given 
the consequences for individuals and communities. 
While chronic racial and ethnic disparity in imprisonment 
has been a known feature of the prison system for many 
decades,12 there has been little adjustment to policy or 
practices—inside or outside the justice system—to 
address these patterns directly. 10  The Sentencing ProjectRacial disparities in incarceration arise from a variety 
of statistical combinations including a high rate of Black 
incarceration, a low rate of white incarceration, or 
varying degrees of the two. We note that the states with 
the highest ratio of disparity in imprisonment are 
generally those in the northeast or upper Midwest, while 
Southern states tend to have lower ratios. The low 
Southern ratios are generally produced as a result of 
high rates of incarceration for both Blacks and whites. 
For example, Arkansas has a Black/white ratio of 3.6:1 
and Florida has a Black/white ratio of 4.1:1, considerably 
below the national average of 4.8:1. Yet both states 
incarcerate African Americans at higher than average 
rates, 29% higher in Arkansas and 14% higher in Florida. 
But these rates are somewhat offset by the particularly 
high white rates of incarceration, 72% higher than the 
national average in Arkansas and 30% higher in Florida.
Conversely, in the states with the highest degree of 
disparity, this is often produced by a higher than average 
Black rate, but a relatively low white rate.13  As seen in 
Table 3 below, seven of the 10 states with the greatest 
racial disparity also have high Black incarceration rates, 
while all have lower than average white rates.  In New 
Jersey, for example, Blacks are incarcerated at a rate 
over twelve times that of whites even though the Black 
incarceration rate is 19% below the national average.  
The high rate of Black/white racial disparity in New 
Jersey reflects a particularly low incarceration of whites: 
81 per 100,000, or nearly one-third the national average 
(261).

Statistics; U.S. Census Bureau (n.d.). Age, sex, race, and Hispanic-origin--6 
race groups. (SC EST 2019-ALLDATA6).The scale of racial disparity in incarceration can also 
be seen by comparing states that have lower than 
average Black incarceration rates to those with higher 
than average white incarceration rates. Here we find 
that the states with the highest white rates (Oklahoma, 
Idaho, Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas) are still well 
below most of those with the lowest Black rates 
(Massachusetts,14  New Hampshire, Maryland, and New 
York).15  
Enduring racial disparities have long been a focus in 
criminological research and the presence of disparities 
is not disputed.16  There is a strong empirical foundation 
for the persistence of racial and ethnic disparities in 
state imprisonment. Explanations range from variations 
in offending based on race to biased decision making 
in the criminal legal system, and also include a series 
of factors that have placed African Americans and 
others at significant disadvantage. These include but 
are not limited to poverty, education outcomes, 
unemployment history, and criminal history.17  Research 
in this area finds a smaller amount of unwarranted 
disparity for serious crimes like homicide than for less 
serious crimes, especially drug crimes.18 
Criminologist Alfred Blumstein’s seminal research on 
imprisonment trends examined racial differences in 
arrests and compared these with the demographic 
composition of state prison populations. His findings 
were that as much as 20% of prison disparity among 
state prisoners could not be explained by differential 
offending by race. He concluded that if there was no 
discrimination at the point of arrest and points afterward, 
the racial makeup of people in prison should approximate 
the population of people who are arrested. The greatest 
amount of unexplained disparity was found among 
persons sentenced for drug offenses: nearly half of the 
racial disparity for prison among those convicted of 
drug crimes could not be explained by arrest. In a 1991 
follow-up study, Blumstein found that the level of 
unexplained racial disparity was even greater (24%).19  
Subsequent studies have replicated this work with 
newer datasets and found even higher amounts of 
unexplained disparity, particularly in the category of 
drug arrests.20 In a study on arrest outcomes for felonies, 
multivariate analysis of court records between 2017 
and 2018 in Denver showed that felony drug cases The Color of Justice  11against white defendants were statistically significantly 
more likely to be moved to drug court than similarly 
situated cases against Black defendants, holding all 
other factors constant.21 
Reliance on arrest records as a reflection of criminal 
involvement has been contested on the grounds that 
arrests are a more accurate reflection of some criminal 
activity—usually where less discretion is available, as 
in the case with violent crime. In cases where a sizable 
amount of discretion exists, arrests can reflect police 
activity more so than criminal activity.22  In a study of 
the role of gentrification of neighborhoods, researchers 
found that citizen calls for police rose substantially in 
the early phase of “neighborhood renewal” for low-level 
nuisance crimes. Self-report data, or incident-based 
data circumvents the problems with arrest data as a 
measure; here too, we see unexplained race disparity. 
Cassia Spohn’s research finds evidence of racial 
disparity at the point of sentencing and this is most 
evident for low-level crimes; in these matters, judges 
depart from the constraints of the law and in so doing 
may allow racial bias to enter into their judgment.23  
The totality of the research literature on race and ethnic 
differentials in imprisonment leads to a similar 
conclusion: a sizable proportion of disparity in prison 
cannot be explained by patterns in criminal offending.24 
Gaylene Armstrong and Nancy Rodriguez studied the 
county-level differences in juvenile justice outcomes 
across 65 counties in a northeastern state. They found 
that it is not solely individual-level characteristics that 
influence justice outcomes but the composition of the 
community where the juvenile resides that makes a 
difference as well. Specifically, they conclude that 
“juvenile delinquents who live within areas that have 
[more heterogenous populations] will more often be 
detained, regardless of their individual race or ethnicity. ”25  
This is in line with observations by University of 
Berkeley’s Loïc Wacquant, whose writing on race 
relations emphasizes the importance of location as a 
driver in disparity. Specifically, he contends that there 
has been a deliberate effort at correctional control of 
low-income Black communities that followed the end 
of America’s legacy of slavery.26  University of Illinois at Chicago researchers tested 
aspects of this proposition empirically. They examined 
post-slavery county-level criminal justice developments 
in four states to test their theory that more severe felony 
case outcomes would occur in counties that had higher 
rates of slavery in 1860.27  Using proper controls for 
other possible contributing factors, they found that 
being charged in a county with a substantial legacy of 
slavery was associated with increases in pre-trial 
detention, imprisonment, and length of sentence. This 
finding held true for both Blacks and whites, leading 
the authors to conclude that slavery has had long-term 
negative consequences for all, not just African 
Americans. 12  The Sentencing ProjectTHE CAUSES OF DISPARITY
The data in this report document pervasive racial 
disparities in state imprisonment, and make clear that 
despite important improvements in public awareness 
of mass incarceration and some modest successes at 
decarceration, racial and ethnic disparities are still a 
substantial feature of our prison system.
Three recurrent explanations for racial disparities 
emerge from dozens of studies on the topic: a painful 
and enduring legacy of racial subordination, biased 
policies and practices that create or exacerbate 
disparities, and structural disadvantages that perpetuate 
disparities.
A LEGACY OF RACIAL SUBORDINATION
Misperceptions about people of different races or 
ethnicities influences criminal justice outcomes. An 
abundance of evidence finds that beliefs about 
dangerousness and threats to public safety overlap 
with individual perceptions about Black people as well 
as other people of color. Racial prejudice exerts a large, 
negative impact on punishment preferences among 
whites but much less so for Blacks.28  America’s legacy of white supremacy over Black people 
has taken many forms over the country’s history from 
chattel slavery to housing policies that made it 
impossible for African Americans to buy homes. Mass 
incarceration can be viewed as the current iteration.29 
Black youth as young as nine years old express feelings 
of disparate treatment by law enforcement. When 
subjected to sophisticated empirical analysis, University 
of South Florida criminologist James Unnever found 
that this perception of discrimination in his sample was 
associated with negative externalizing behaviors,30  
even when other possible contributors were ruled out. 
Though they may not have had encounters with police 
yet, the traumatic experiences of earlier generations 
are believed to be passed down.31 
Racialized assumptions by key justice system decision 
makers unfairly influence outcomes for people who 
encounter the system. In research on presentence 
reports, for example, scholars have found that people 
of color are frequently given harsher sanctions because 
they are perceived as imposing a greater threat to public 
safety and are therefore deserving of greater social 
“At least in America, race has a subjective history and meaning associated with 
stereotypes and biases that are at times and places closely linked – both explicitly 
and unconsciously – to crime, fear, anxiety, disorder and, ultimately, a yearning for 
more laws, stepped-up enforcement, and harsher sanctions that are felt 
disproportionately by racial and ethnic minorities. ”32   
Eric Baumer, Ph.D. Department of Sociology and 
Criminology, Pennsylvania State University
The Color of Justice  13control and punishment.33 And survey data has found 
that, regardless of respondents’ race, respondents 
associated African Americans with terms such as 
“dangerous, ” “aggressive, ” “violent, ” and “criminal. ”34 
Media portrayals about crime tend to distort reality by 
disproportionately focusing on stories of those involving 
serious crimes and those committed by people of color, 
especially Black-on-white violent crime.35 Since three-
quarters of the public say that they form their opinions 
about crime from the news, this misrepresentation 
feeds directly into the public’s crime policy preferences.36 
Reforms to media reporting that more carefully and 
accurately represent the true incidence of specific 
crimes and their perpetrators, and victims, would change 
perceptions about crime but would not necessarily 
impact how these perceptions translate into policy 
preferences. A 2013 study by Stanford University 
scholars found that public awareness of racial disparities 
in prisons actually increases support for harsher 
punishments.37  Using an experimental research design, 
researchers exposed subjects to facts about racial 
compositions. When prisons were described as “more 
Black, ” respondents were more supportive of harsh 
crime policies that contribute to those disparities.  On 
the other hand, some studies find that when individuals—
practitioners in particular—are made consciously aware 
of their bias through implicit bias training, diversification 
of the workforce, and education on the important 
differences between implicit and explicit bias, this can 
mitigate or even erase the actions they would otherwise 
take based on unexplored assumptions.38  There is 
some evidence of the positive effects of this: a 2004 
study found that whites were less in favor of federal 
sentencing laws that created a disparity between crack 
and powder cocaine offenses once they were informed 
about the law’s disproportionate impact on African 
Americans.39
BIASED POLICIES AND PRACTICES 
The rise in incarceration that has come to be known as 
mass incarceration began in the early 1970s and is 
widely attributed to three major eras of policymaking, 
all of which had a disparate impact on people of color, especially African Americans. Until 1986, a series of 
policies was enacted to expand the use of imprisonment 
for a variety of felonies. After this point, the focus moved 
to greater levels of imprisonment for drug and sex 
offenses. There was a particularly sharp growth in state 
imprisonment for drug offenses between 1987 and 
1991. In the final stage, beginning around 1995, the 
emphasis was on increasing both prison likelihood and 
significantly lengthening prison sentences.40 
The criminal legal system is held together by policies 
and practices, both formal and informal, which influence 
the degree to which an individual penetrates the system. 
At multiple points in the system, race may play a role. 
Disparities mount as individuals progress through the 
system, from the initial point of arrest to the final point 
of imprisonment.41  Harsh punishment policies, some 
of which were put into effect after crime began to decline 
in the early 1990s, are the main cause of the historic 
rise in imprisonment that has occurred over the past 
40 years.42 
Policing
As we have seen by continued unlawful engagement 
by police with the public, including the tragic killing of 
unarmed Black people by law enforcement officers, 
police-citizen relations continue to reflect bias within 
the criminal legal system. 
Disparities are evident at the initial point of contact 
with police, especially through policies that target 
specific areas and low-level offenses that allow a high 
degree of discretion. Police should be instructed to limit 
their work to addressing actual crime but instead have 
been tasked with an growing array of responsibilities 
that fall under their purview dealing with public order, 
traffic, and misdemeanor offenses.43  Though police 
stops alone may not result in a conviction that would 
lead to a prison sentence, the presence of a criminal 
record that results from an arrest or conviction is 
associated with the decision to incarcerate for 
subsequent offenses, a sequence of events that 
disadvantages African Americans. Jeffrey Fagan’s work 
in this area found that police officers’ selection of who 
to stop in New York’s now infamous “stop, question,  14  The Sentencing Projectand frisk” policing program was dictated more by racial 
composition of the neighborhood than by actual crime 
in the area.44  His research showed that the process of 
stopping, questioning and frisking individuals was based 
on little more than suspicion (or on nebulous terms 
such as “furtive behavior, ” which were the justification 
for many stops) and led to unnecessary criminal records 
for thousands. New York’s policy was ruled 
unconstitutional in 2013 with a court ruling in Floyd v. 
The City of New York.  A recent study of more than 60 
million police stops between 2011 and 2015 across the 
U.S. revealed that Black drivers were stopped more 
frequently than white drivers and controlling for age, 
sex, time, and location, Black and Latinx drivers were 
more likely to be ticketed, searched, and arrested. In 
addition, the study revealed evidence of a lower bar for 
searching vehicles with Black drivers than for white 
drivers.45 
Pre-trial detention
Other stages of the system contribute to the racial 
composition of state prisons as well. Factors such as 
pre-trial detention—more likely to be imposed on Black 
defendants because of income inequality—contributes 
to disparities because those who are detained pretrial 
are more likely to be convicted and sentenced to 
longer prison terms.46 Cassia Spohn’s analysis of 40 
state sentencing processes finds that, though crime 
seriousness and prior record are key determinants at 
sentencing, the non-legal factors of race and ethnicity 
also influence sentencing decisions. She notes that: 
“Black and Hispanic offenders—particularly those 
who are young, male, and unemployed—are more 
likely than their white counterparts to be sentenced to 
prison than similarly situated white offenders. Other 
categories of racial minorities—those convicted of 
drug offenses, those who victimize whites, those 
who accumulate more serious prior criminal records, 
or those who refuse to plead guilty or are unable to 
secure pretrial release—also may be singled out for 
more punitive treatment. ”47
Criminal history records
Racial disparities are most evident in decisions to 
sentence a person to incarceration or divert them 
to community supervision.48 Studies seeking to better understand the processes between arrest and 
imprisonment, particularly at the stage of sentencing, 
have been pursued in order to better understand the 
unexplained disparities in state prisons.49 To many, 
the role of prior convictions has been overlooked as 
a factor.
Arrest for low-level drug offenses create disparate 
outcomes by race. Black and white individuals use 
and sell drugs at comparable levels but Black people 
are nearly four times as likely as whites to be arrested 
for drug offenses and 2.5 times as likely to be arrested 
for drug possession.50  
Differential responses by the criminal legal system 
create greater imprisonment odds for Black Americans. 
Research finds that presence of a prior criminal 
record carries substantial weight in sentencing. The 
American judicial system considers prior record 
heavily at sentencing and applies what sentencing 
scholar Kevin Reitz refers to as a “recidivist premium. ” 
In a system where a longer criminal history justifies 
a longer prison sentence, this means that criminal 
history factors disproportionately affect Black people. 
In the most in-depth study completed on racial 
disparities in a single state’s prison system, Richard 
Frase, co-director of the esteemed Robina Institute of 
Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at the University of 
Minnesota, found that two thirds of racial disparities 
in Minnesota’s imprisonment rates resulted from 
criminal history factors weighed at sentencing.51   
Weighing criminal history at sentencing may feel 
intuitively wise but can be problematic. If previous 
encounters with the system are the result of racially 
biased engagement with the system, subsequent 
sentences that rely on these prior records as a 
measure of dangerousness worsen those disparities 
even more.52 
Prosecutorial charging
Still other research finds that prosecutorial charging 
decisions play out unequally when viewed by race, 
placing Blacks at a significant disadvantage to whites. 
Prosecutors are more likely to charge Black defendants 
under state habitual offender laws than similarly situated 
white defendants.53 Researchers in Florida found The Color of Justice  15evidence for this relationship, and also observed that 
the relationship between race and use of the state 
habitual offender law was stronger for less serious 
crimes than it was for more serious crimes.54 And 
California’s three strikes law was identified as widening 
disparities because of the greater likelihood of prior 
convictions among African Americans. Californian’s 
voted to repeal parts of the law in 2012 to limit the 
allowability of previous convictions as “strikes. ”55 
PERPETUATING STRUCTURAL DISADVANTAGE
A third explanation for persistent racial disparities in 
state prisons lies in the structural disadvantages that 
impact people of color long before they encounter the 
criminal legal system. In this view, disparities observed 
in imprisonment are partially a function of 
disproportionate social factors in African American 
communities that are associated with poverty, 
employment, housing, and family differences.56  Other 
factors, not simply race, account for differences in crime 
across place. Criminologists Ruth Peterson and Lauren 
Krivo note that African Americans comprise a 
disproportionate share of those living in poverty-stricken 
neighborhoods and communities where a range of 
socio-economic vulnerabilities contribute to higher 
rates of crime, particularly violent crime.57  In fact, 62% 
of African Americans reside in highly segregated, inner 
city neighborhoods that experience a high degree of 
violent crime, while the majority of whites live in more 
advantaged neighborhoods that experience little violent 
crime.58  Their work builds on earlier research focused 
on the harms done to the African American community 
by disparate living environments, and extends this 
knowledge to evidence that this actually produces social 
problems including crime.
The impact of structural disadvantage begins early in 
life. When looking at juvenile crime rates across race, 
it should not be assumed that youth of color have a 
greater tendency to engage in delinquency, but that the 
uneven playing field created for people of color from 
the start, a part of larger American society, creates 
inequalities which are related to who goes on to commit 
crime and who is equipped to desist from crime.59  More specifically, as a result of structural differences by race 
and class, youth of color are more likely to experience 
unstable family systems, exposure to family and/or 
community violence, elevated rates of unemployment, 
and higher school dropout rates.60  All of these factors 
are more likely to exist in communities of color, 
replicating social inequities that contribute to the 
decision to engage in crime.
Moving forward
Criminal justice reform has become a regular component 
of mainstream domestic policy discussions in recent 
years. There is growing recognition among policymakers 
that the system of mass incarceration has not been an 
effective remedy for crime and has exacerbated racial 
inequities. Some jurisdictions have pursued reforms 
that include scaling back stop and frisk practices by 
law enforcement and enacting legislative changes that 
shift certain offenses from felonies to misdemeanors.61  
These may reduce overall incarceration rates with the 
prospect of greater impact on racial and ethnic minorities 
as well.
Even though the pace of criminal reform is relatively 
modest in addressing the scale of mass incarceration 
and its enduring racial and ethnic disparities, the higher 
levels of decarceration in some states are encouraging. 
New Jersey, which has the greatest Black/white disparity 
in the nation, provides an example of this potential. 
Despite its high ranking in disparity among sentenced 
prisoners, New Jersey has recently pursued a range of 
reforms that could ameliorate persistent disparities 
and accelerate progress if implemented to their fullest. 
Like most states, New Jersey experienced a steady rise 
in incarceration from the 1970s through the 1990s. 
Between 2000 and 2019, however, the state has reduced 
its prison population by 38%. Table 4 shows that the 
state’s decarceration so far appears to have had the 
greatest benefit to Black and Latinx individuals. The 
overall depopulation of New Jersey prisons has included 
a 39% reduction in African American prisoners, a 45% 
reduction in Latinx prisoners, and a 30% reduction in 
white prisoners.  16  The Sentencing ProjectTable 4. Change in Prison Population and Composition, 
New Jersey 2000-2019
In response to The Sentencing Project’s 2016 report62  
that identified New Jersey as ranking highest in the 
nation in Black-to-white disparity, the state legislature 
quickly adopted “racial impact” legislation to mitigate 
the identified disparate impact of proposed crime 
legislation on Black and Latinx individuals going 
forward.63  Since the bill’s passage two years ago, 
however, only one racial impact statement has ever 
accompanied a bill, according to media reports.64  
In contrast, Iowa has undergone 26 separate racial 
impact analyses since its racial impact law passed in 
2009.65  Since The Sentencing Project’s initial analysis 
of Iowa’s racial disparity in 2007,66  in which we reported 
a Black/white disparity of 13.6:1, the Black-to-white 
disparity has dropped to 9.3:1.67 Though we cannot be 
sure that this decline is related to the introduction of 
racial impact statements, it is encouraging to see the 
state embrace racial impact laws and also reduce the 
gap between Black and white incarceration levels. 
Making such analysis retroactive to correct for misguided 
policies already in place will likely result in quicker 
progress toward racial equity. Year Prison Total White Black Latinx

The war on drugs has not been an effective approach 
to addressing either substance use disorders or the 
crimes associated with them. The policies enacted 
worsened racial disparities in incarceration. Yet, many 
laws are still in effect at both the state and federal levels 
that sentence individuals to lengthy prison terms for 
drug–related offenses when alternatives to incarceration 
would be more suitable. Official arrest statistics from 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicate that 
there were over 600,000 arrests for marijuana possession 
in 2018, representing 6% of all arrests nationally.68  Even 
when an arrest does not result in conviction or 
imprisonment, it creates a criminal record. Drug law 
enforcement is disproportionately aimed at low-income 
communities of color, creating downstream 
consequences for these residents that are not felt by 
those in affluent, primarily white communities. 
Reforms should be enacted that scale back the use of 
prison for low-level drug offenses and instead redirect 
resources to prevention and drug intervention 
programming. One reform gaining favor eliminates or 
substantially limits the authority for law enforcement 
to make drug-related arrests. In Northern Virginia’s 
Fairfax County, for instance, Commonwealth Attorney 
Steve Descano, in office since January 2020, has 
instructed law enforcement to discontinue arrests for 
simple possession of marijuana.69 This has the potential 
to substantially decrease racial disparities in a county 
where African Americans were more than three times 
as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than 
whites.70  
ENACT PROPORTIONAL SENTENCING
A host of mandatory minimum sentences and truth-in-
sentencing provisions are still in place in most states.  
These remove judicial discretion from the sentencing 
process and tie up limited corrections resources by 
incarcerating those who may no longer be a threat to 
public safety. The states and federal government should 
revisit and revise mandatory minimum sentences and 
other determinate sentencing systems that deny an 
individualized approach.In addition, states should scale back punishments for 
serious crimes, especially those that trigger long 
sentences for repeat offenses. Applying recidivism 
premiums to sentences—especially for low-level 
offenses—is not an effective public safety strategy. 
Indeed there is no evidence demonstrating that it 
actually improves public safety. While public safety is 
always a priority, imposing excessively long prison 
sentences has actually been shown to have diminishing 
returns on public safety.71  Furthermore, these policies 
have had a disproportionate impact on people of color, 
especially African Americans, because they are more 
likely to have a prior record, either because of more 
frequent engagement in crime or because of more 
frequent engagement with law enforcement.72  
MEASURE IMPACT OF CRIME POLICIES ON ALL 
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS 
Finally, several states are pursuing racial impact 
legislation, an idea that first became law in the state of 
Iowa in 2008. To date, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, 
Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Oregon have 
implemented racial impact laws and nearly a dozen 
additional states have introduced similar legislation. 
The idea behind racial impact laws is to consider the 
outcome of changes in the criminal code before passing 
laws in order to provide an opportunity for policymakers 
to consider alternative approaches that do not 
exacerbate disparities. Similar to fiscal impact 
statements or environmental impact statements, racial 
impact statements forecast the effect of policy changes      
on people of different races and ethnicities. The theory 
behind racial impact statements is that there is a cost, 
both financial and moral, to maintaining racial and 
ethnic disparities.73  
An improvement to the efficacy of racial impact 
statements would be to establish a retroactive look at 
existing criminal penalties that have caused undue 
harm to Black and Latinx communities. Identifying 
existing laws that have contributed to the current levels 
of disparity should be followed by reversal or reform of 
these laws.RECOMMENDATIONS 18  The Sentencing ProjectStates exhibit astounding rates of racial and ethnic 
disparity in their rates of incarceration: African 
Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly 
five times the rate of whites. This report also shows 
that racial disparities vary broadly across the states, 
from a high of 12.5:1 to a low of 2.3:1, but even in 
Hawaii—the state with the lowest Black/white disparity—
African Americans are imprisoned at more than two 
times the rate of whites.
There is not enough attention paid or action required 
to end the chronic racial disparities that pervade state 
prisons. If we continue to ignore or tolerate these 
disparities,  the United States is unlikely to achieve the 
serious, sustainable reforms that are needed to end 
mass incarceration. Overall, the pace of criminal justice 
reform has been too slow as well as too modest in its 
goals. Accelerated reforms that deliberately incorporate 
the goal of racial justice will lead to a system that is 
both much smaller and fairer.
Despite widespread acknowledgement that more needs 
to be done to achieve racial equity in the criminal legal 
system, reforms have stopped short of arriving at a 
system that is truly fair and responsive to all 
communities. Recent cases of police violence have 
accelerated calls for racial justice across the U.S. That 
urgency should extend to confronting racial injustices 
that pervade the entire criminal legal system.     CONCLUSIONThe Color of Justice  19METHODOLOGY
This report relies primarily on two major sources of 
official data. The first is the U.S. Census, which counts 
the nation’s residents every ten years and provides 
estimates based on projections for years between its 
official counts. The data in the report comes from 2019 
projections based on the 2010 U.S. Census. The second 
source of data used to generate the findings in this 
report is the U.S Bureau of Justice Statistics. Each year, 
it publishes results from its National Prisoner Statistics 
(NPS) survey of the state departments of corrections. 
The data used to generate the National Prisoners Series, 
most recently Prisoners in 2019¸ are housed on the 
National Criminal Justice Archive’s Inter-University 
Consortium for Political and Social Research. Data on 
race and ethnicity of prisoners sentenced to at least 
one year in prison (NPS survey question: “On December 
31, how many inmates under your jurisdiction -- a. Had 
a total maximum sentence of more than 1 year [Include 
inmates with consecutive sentences that add to more 
than 1 year]) . The Prisoners in 2019 publication reports 
state totals in Table 4. Additionally, each state provides 
to BJS the demographic composition of its prison 
population, though this is not typically reported in the 
National Prisoners Series. In the following states, data 
on race and ethnicity provided directly from state 
departments of corrections to The Sentencing Project 
were used to augment the BJS data: Connecticut, 
Hawaii, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Rhode Island.
Racial and ethnic composition of people in prison is 
reported in the BJS Prisoners Series . Readers of this 
report may notice differences between the BJS data on 
imprisonment rates and the reported disparity ratios. 
In particular, BJS shows higher incarceration rates when 
viewed by race. As noted by colleagues elsewhere,74  
BJS makes adjustments in certain states and these 
appear to lower the white imprisonment rates by a proportionately larger amount than they lower the Black 
imprisonment rates (compared to the rates in this 
report). As a result, the BJS black-white imprisonment 
disparity is slightly larger than the disparities reported 
here. The trends in the black-white disparity ratios in 
the BJS data, however, track closely with the trends 
shared in this report. The Latinx-white disparity reported 
in the Prisoners Series  is larger than the one reported 
here.  20  The Sentencing ProjectAPPENDIX

comprise the vast majority of people in prison.

10. We observe that 41% of people in state prisons are white, 
39% are Black, and 17% are Latinx, a contrast with the 
overall general population where 76% are white, 13% are 
Black, and 19% are Latinx. In 12 states more than half of 
the prison population is African American. Though the reli-
ability of data on ethnicity is not as strong as it is for race 
estimates, the Latinx population in state prisons is as high 
as 60% in New Mexico, and over 40% in both Arizona and 
in California. However, viewing the composition of prison 
populations from this perspective only tells some of the 
story of the profound difference imprisonment plays in the 
lives of people of various racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
In this report we present the rates of racial disparity, which 
allows an analysis of the overrepresentation of people of 
color in the prison system accounting for population in the 
general community. This view allows one to see the odds 
of imprisonment for individuals in various racial and ethnic 
categories.

14. Data from Massachusetts used this report should be inter-
preted with caution. The system of incarceration in Massa-
chusetts is somewhat unique in that this state uses coun -
ty-level houses of corrections to hold some people who 
have been convicted of felonies and sentenced up to 2.5 
years. The population of prisoners in houses of corrections 
is approximately 275, but the racial composition of those 
incarcerated at these institutions is not publicly reported. 
For this reason, estimates in this report do not include 
those in houses of corrections. As a result, the rates of in-
carceration by race and ethnicity are underestimated. For 
more on the composition of Massachusetts prison system, 
see: Massachusetts Department of Corrections (2019).
