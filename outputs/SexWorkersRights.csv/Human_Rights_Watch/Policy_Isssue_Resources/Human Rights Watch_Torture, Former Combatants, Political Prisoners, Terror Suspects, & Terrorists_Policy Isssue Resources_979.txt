SummaryAgreement in April 2009 by the armed opposition NationalLiberation Forces (Forces Nationales de la Libération, FNL) todisarm and demobilize and the government’s registration of the FNL as apolitical party represent significant developments in Burundi’s path out of armed conflict towards peace and democracy. The developments may pavethe way towards both a final peace agreement and Burundi’s first generalelections since the end of military government in 2001 in which all significantpolitical forces compete within the democratic process.Progress towards peace between the National Council for theDefense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (Conseil Nationalpour la Défense de la Démocratie-Forces pour la Défense dela Démocratie, CNDD-FDD) dominated government and the FNL has beenbumpy, with the FNL periodically withdrawing from negotiations. Furthermore, asthis report describes, both the CNDD-FDD and the FNL have also deployedpolitical violence and intimidation against opponents and dissenting voices,even while in talks. By and large these abuses have been committed withimpunity, revealing a political culture in which violence and repression is deeplyrooted.Particularly in the case of the CNDD-FDD, democraticopponents from across the political spectrum have also been targets of abuse.With the CNDD-FDD and the FNL, both predominantly Hutu, now competing alongsideother parties for the electoral support of Burundi’s majority Hutupopulation, progress in the peace process may alter some of the parameters ofone context for human rights abuse—CNDD-FDD/FNL competition—but isnot a safeguard against continuing violence, intimidation, and repression.Over recent years, including in the first few months of2009, state agents and unofficial proxies acting with the complicity ofadministrative officials and security forces have carried out killings,beatings, arrests, and other acts of intimidation, and have enforced furtherlimits on the freedom of association. The majority of incidents have beentaking place either in the poor outskirts of the capital or in rural areas andsmall towns. Government officials have done little to investigate incidents orbring perpetrators to justice.These abuses appear to have largely been beneath the radarof international friends of Burundi’s transition to democraticgovernance, as they have rarely involved senior political figures (althoughsome have). This lack of attention has been decried by various analysts andBurundian democratic opposition members, for it is in these locations andthrough these kinds of incidents that fundamental challenges to democracy, ruleof law, and respect for human rights are being played out.As Burundi moves closer to elections, firm action is neededfrom the government to put a stop to political violence and to end impunity, aswell as to create the conditions in which the people of the country are able tofreely exercise their civil and political rights by voting for the candidatesof their choice.Competition between CNDD-FDD and the FNL is a key dynamic inwhich violence and abuse have been used. Much of the violence has directlypitted local government officials and supporters of the CNDD-FDD against FNLcombatants and supporters. State agents affiliated with CNDD-FDD, includinglocal administrative officials and police officers, have in some cases beendirectly implicated in human rights abuses against FNL members. In other casesthey have tacitly taken the ruling party’s side by failing to investigateabuses against FNL members. For their part, FNL members have engaged incriminal acts including killings and abductions—some sanctioned by FNLleadership—against state agents, CNDD-FDD members, and dissidents withinthe FNL.The most recent wave of violence took place between December2008 and February 2009. In early December, unidentified assailants burnt downfive CNDD-FDD meeting places in Kayogoro, Makamba province, heralding a seriesof tit-for tat politically-motivated incidents. By the end of February over 50CNDD-FDD meeting places in at least 10 provinces had been destroyed by arson.In Kayogoro and Nyamurenza, Ngozi province, in December 2008FNL activists were arbitrarily detained and beaten by local governmentofficials and CNDD-FDD members, with police complicity. Then in January 2009, aCNDD-FDD activist, who had been a ringleader in the beatings of FNL members inNyamurenza, was shot and killed; two FNL members have been arrested andcharged.Also, in January 2009, grenades were thrown at the homes oftwo FNL members in Nyabikere, Karusi province. The next day a CNDD-FDD communaladministrator in Nyabikere was attacked and wounded at his home. Theadministrator had been identified by police in 2008 as a main suspect in thekilling of a member of the FNL youth league, but had not been charged or tried.Meanwhile, in Kayogoro and Busoni, Kirundo province, membersof the CNDD-FDD youth league have engaged in what they describe as night-time“sports”—parading through the streets wielding sticks andclubs, threatening members of other political groups, including the FNL, andarresting political opponents.This cycle of partisan violence harks back to early 2008,when civilians associated with the FNL, the ruling CNDD-FDD, and theintelligence service (Service National du Renseignement, SNR) werevictims of targeted assassinations in and around Bujumbura. Killings weretraced to demobilized FDD combatants (“démobilisés”)working for the police and the intelligence service, on the one hand, and toFNL members, on the other.The FNL also has a history of addressing politicalchallenges through violence. In 2007 the FNL—then known as the Party forthe Liberation of the Hutu People-National Liberation Forces (Parti pour laLibération du Peuple Hutu-Forces Nationales de Libération,Palipehutu-FNL)—carried out a series of attacks on a group generallyknown in Burundi as “the alleged FNL dissidents.” These served nolegitimate military end but were designed to send a message about what happensto FNL defectors. More recently, in January 2009, high-ranking FNL combatantsabducted and abused a civilian FNL supporter who had expressed dissenting viewsand another FNL dissenter was killed in February 2009.The widow of one victim who abandoned the FNL to become apolice informant and was subsequently killed by FNL members described herhusband’s dilemma: “As an FNL member, the CNDD-FDD comes after you.As a CNDD-FDD member, the FNL comes after you.” In all the incidents thattook place in early 2008, victims were unable to secure access to justice. Thecrimes against them were either inadequately investigated or no investigationat all took place. There have been no prosecutions of the perpetrators.During the violence in early 2008, the FNL was boycottingpeace talks with the government and was carrying out sporadic armed attacks.Meanwhile, police and demobilisés regularly arrested and beatalleged FNL members.The renewed cycle of abuses beginning in December 2008 tookplace precisely when peace negotiations in Bujumbura were finally movingforward.  Furthermore, the ruling CNDD-FDD has a history of targetingdemocratic opponents as well as those in armed opposition groups. This suggeststhat a formal peace will not, without further action in support of the rule oflaw, address local-level, politically-motivated human rights abuses.Among the serious abuses committed against democraticpolitical opponents in early 2009 was the killing of at least three members ofthe Democratic Front in Burundi (Front pour la Démocratie au Burundi),FRODEBU, the largest opposition party, in the Kamenge and Kinama neighborhoods ofBujumbura. According to witnesses, CNDD-FDD members and SNR agents wereresponsible. Another FRODEBU member was killed in Kamenge in similarcircumstances around the same time, although in this case the perpetrators haveyet to be identified.These killings followed other attacks on members of FRODEBUand other opposition parties in mid-2007 and early 2008. In addition, in thesecond half of 2008, the CNDD-FDD-dominated government began to deploy otherforms of repression against political opponents. The government expelled 22opposition members from parliament; illegally shut down oppositionparties’ meetings and press conferences; and arrested at least 120opposition party activists between July 2008 and April 2009, particularlytargeting the Movement for Solidarity and Democracy (MSD) and the Union forPeace and Development (UPD-Zigamibanga).Government and CNDD-FDD officials, as well as FNL leaders,have consistently denied responsibility for acts of violence. Human RightsWatch investigations have found that some incidents were coordinated throughestablished hierarchies, while other abuses were carried out by local activistswithout consulting their superiors. Neither group’s leaders have condemnedabuses by their own members nor have they taken sufficient measures to ensurethat they are abiding by the law. There were some limited exceptions: in late2008, two police officers responsible for abuses were removed from theirpositions, although they were transferred to headquarters and received nodisciplinary sanctions. And in March 2009, the FNL collaborated for the firsttime with a police investigation into crimes committed by members, resulting inseveral arrests, although many other crimes attributed to FNL members have goneunsolved.Local CNDD-FDD officials have said they suspect members ofmainstream democratic political parties of being behind some of the recentarson incidents. Human Rights Watch did not find conclusive evidence linkingparties other than the FNL and CNDD-FDD to abuses. But oppositionparties’ rhetoric has become increasingly vitriolic, which underlines therisk that violence by CNDD-FDD and FNL poses to the wider democratic process. Asenior member of one party told Human Rights Watch, “CNDD-FDD took uparms [in the 1990s] because of an absence of democracy. They don’t realizethat others can take up arms too. All of the parties have youth that we canmobilize.”Overall, police officers have failed to enforce lawseffectively to prevent and punish human rights abuses. When allegedperpetrators have been arrested, the arrests have often been accompanied byill-treatment, and have rarely been followed by thorough investigations andprosecutions. Judicial authorities, working within a judicial system plagued byinadequate resources and interference from the executive, have been equally ineffectivein enforcing the law.The continued use of what one citizen described to HumanRights Watch as “the logic of the gun” by CNDD-FDD and the FNL, aswell as the government’s failure to move purposefully towards the rule oflaw in the three years since it took power, raises fear that human rightsabuses will escalate with the approach of elections in 2010. CNDD-FDD and theFNL have proved all too ready to commit abuses in efforts to dominate thepolitical landscape, eliminate competitors, and assert power.International actors have focused on establishing a formalpeace and are not paying adequate attention to current human rights violationsand accountability for past abuses. European and US diplomats respondedstrongly to the arrest of a prominent opposition leader in November 2008, buthave shown much less public concern about human rights violations affectingordinary Burundians in rural and marginal urban areas—the most numerousvictims of abuse. Neither have diplomats defended the rights of politicalfigures who were “unpopular” in the diplomatic community. Theprotection of the human rights of all Burundians is fundamental to peace, thetransition to democracy, and successful elections.The Burundian government and all political organizations shouldend violence against civilians, illegal arrests, and repressive measuresorchestrated to intimidate political opponents. Impunity and lack of judicialindependence are underlying concerns which clearly need addressing to preventhuman rights abuses during the pre-election period. Government officials shouldinvestigate and hold accountable persons on all sides who are responsible forabuses. Additionally, Human Rights Watch calls on international partners,particularly those involved in facilitating the peace process and donors to thesecurity sector, to pay particular attention to violence and politicalrepression in rural Burundi, and take measures to assist in ending it.Meanwhile, early preparations need to be made to ensure thatthe Independent National Electoral Commission (Commission ElectoraleNationale Indépendante), established in early 2009, is well-equippedand has a strong mandate to carry out the timely investigation of electionrelated violence, allegations of irregularities in voter registration, illegalrestriction on political campaigning and media bias prior to voting. The CENIshould be able to refer cases to the judiciary wherenecessary.II. MethodologyThis report is based on over 200 interviews conducted byHuman Rights Watch in 13 of the 17 provinces of Burundi between May 2007 andApril 2009.Human Rights Watch spoke with dozens of victims of abusesand their family members. Some victims—mostly detained FNL members whohad suffered ill-treatment—were encountered on visits to jails andprisons. Journalists, local administrative officials, and human rightsobservers from Burundian organizations and the UN put Human Rights Watch incontact with other victims and witnesses. Human Rights Watch researchersgenerally conducted private interviews with one person at a time, though someinterviews in Nyamurenza, Nyabikere and Kayogoro communes were conducted withsmall groups of four to eight victims. Researchers conducted interviews inFrench or, with the help of an interpreter, in Kirundi or Kiswahili. No incentives were offered or provided to persons interviewed.Human Rights Watch researchers spoke regularly withrepresentatives of all main political parties and movements during the courseof this research to follow human rights abuses and other acts of violencetargeting political parties. Information provided by political party activiststhat is presented in the main text of the report was in almost all casescross-checked with other sources, including officials from other politicalparties. Police and judicial officials provided further information on arrestsof party activists and acts of political violence, as well as the status ofinvestigations into these abuses.A number of police officers, CNDD-FDD ex-combatants, and FNLmembers spoke to Human Rights Watch on the condition of anonymity, providinginside information on abuses committed by members of those groups.Human Rights Watch also interviewed military andintelligence officials, African Union peacekeepers, representatives of localand international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), diplomats, and staff ofthe United Nations (UN).This report is not a comprehensive account of human rightsabuses during the period of research. UN human rights observers, Burundianhuman rights organizations, and journalists provided Human Rights Watch withreports of dozens of other human rights abuses, including killings, beatings,and arrests. For the purposes of this report, Human Rights Watch focused onincidents which appear to have been politically motivated. The report does notcover several reported cases in which police, soldiers, or SNR agents killedcivilians due to conflicts of an apparently personal nature, although these tooconstituted human rights violations when the state took no action againstperpetrators. Neither does the report cover a number of killings committed byFNL members, many of which were apparently carried out in the course of armedrobberies.[1]Among incidents that appeared to be politically motivated,we further focused our research based on the seriousness of the abuse and thelikelihood that it would contribute to cycles of violence, as well as ourability to verify the facts based on multiple sources. A Human Rights Watchresearcher carried out in-depth field research in Bujumbura, Bujumbura Rurale,Ngozi, and Karusi in order to document politically-motivated murders. HumanRights Watch met with detainees in Bujumbura, Cibitoke, Gitega, Makamba, andNgozi who were victims of beatings, and in all cases either personallydocumented scars on their bodies or received collaborating information fromBINUB or police officials.We received reports of a number of otherpolitically-motivated abuses that, while they did not rise to the level ofmurder, physical violence, or deprivation of liberty, were nonetheless causefor concern. For instance, political party activists (including members ofCNDD-FDD) and FNL members frequently reported that they received threatening anonymousphone calls and text messages. Political parties also reported symbolicdestruction of property, including the burning of party meeting houses, and thetheft of party flags. Human Rights Watch was unable to document all such casesof threats and symbolic violence, although we recognize that such abuses shouldbe treated seriously and investigated by police and judicial authorities,particularly given the history of escalation of political violence in Burundi.In one exception, we document the burning of CNDD-FDD meeting houses, due to boththe extent of the phenomenon and the fact that it served as a pretext forfurther abuses.For reasons of security, the names of interviewees areomitted from some citations and are replaced with pseudonyms. The pseudonymsused consist of initials that do not match the interviewee’sreal name.III. RecommendationsTo the Government of BurundiTake necessary steps to ensure that all state securityforces, including the police, the army, and the SNR, comply with Burundianand international law regarding searches, arrests, and the treatment ofdetainees.Cease all arrests on the basis of political partymembership or activity when such activity does not constitute a crimeaccording to Burundian law. Ensure that all persons in detention,including opposition party members, are brought before independent judgesto review their detention and order their release if no grounds for theirdetention are proven. Those who are tried should be guaranteed a speedytrial in accordance with international fair trial standards.Instruct all provincial and communal authorities to permitmeetings by all registered parties.Apply the constitution equally to all political parties byeither reinstating the 22 opposition parliamentarians expelled from theNational Assembly as “independents” in June or expelling thepro-government parliamentarians who also qualify as“independents.”Immediately cease all collaboration between securityforces and armed civilian groups. Open investigations into the conduct ofpolice and intelligence officials who have knowingly collaborated witharmed civilian groups and encouraged them to carry out arrests andill-treatment of alleged FNL members or members of the politicalopposition.Through the prosecutors’ office, continue or reopeninvestigations into unsolved murders and attempted murders of civiliansallegedly affiliated with the FNL, CNDD-FDD, the SNR, and oppositionpolitical parties in early 2008 and early 2009, and bring suspects tojustice.While respecting the law already in place concerning“provisional immunity,” ensure that peace negotiations withFNL result in provisions allowing for the eventual prosecution of those onall sides who have committed serious crimes in relation to the armedconflict.Enforce Article 411 of the new criminal code, whichpenalizes the arbitrary deprivation of liberty by state agents.End all interference by the executive branch in thefunctioning of the judicial system and take all necessary steps to put inplace an effective, independent judiciary.To the FNLInstruct all members to respect the law governingactivities of political parties.Instruct members to abstain from all acts of violenceagainst state agents and all civilians, particularly CNDD-FDD members.Assist the police and the prosecutor’s office ininvestigations that may lead to the arrests of any FNL members who havecommitted serious crimes that are not covered by provisional immunity,including rape and murder.To Burundian Political PartiesCommit to a zero-tolerance policy against any form ofpolitical violence by members. Cooperate with police and judicialinvestigations on any crimes attributed to members.Make use of the Burundian judicial system to pursue abusescommitted against party members.Disband any youth movements involved in the promotion ofviolence.To the United NationsPress the Government of Burundi to end allpolitically-motivated arrests and other forms of harassment of oppositionparty members.Carefully monitor the government’s compliance withthe criminal procedure code and the independence of the judicial system,and take steps to support the development of an independent, effectivejudiciary.Actively denounce human rights abuses documented by humanrights observers on the ground, and regularly raise these issues with thegovernment, requesting specific action to end these abuses.Ensure that reporting from all BINUB sections, includingthe political and security sector reform sections, takes into accounthuman rights violations related to political and security sector reform.Monitor the usage of Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) moniesdisbursed to the Government of Burundi, particularly those disbursed tothe police and the SNR, to ensure that these funds contribute to endingimpunity and play no role in facilitating human rights abuses.To International Actors Involved in the PeaceProcessInsist that the Government of Burundi demonstrate itscommitment to the peace process by ceasing all arbitrary arrests,intimidation, beating, and extrajudicial executions of alleged FNL membersand sympathizers and holding to account those responsible for such abuses.Improve utilization of the ceasefire monitoring mechanismas a forum in which to demand clarification of serious human rights abusesby both government and FNL forces, particularly the unsolved murderstargeting both sides.Pay particular attention to violence and human rightsabuses attributed to FNL and CNDD-FDD members in the interior, and use thepeace process to seek an end to such abuses.Monitor activities of peacekeepers responsible forprotecting the FNL delegation, in order to ensure they avoid complicity inhuman rights violations by FNL members.To Donor GovernmentsWork through the “Groupe de Coordination desPartenaires” (Partners Coordination Group) dedicated to securitysector reform to ensure that all security forces are sufficiently trainedwith regard to criminal procedure, rule of law, international human rightslaw, and humanitarian law. Condition funding on demands that members ofthe security forces who commit human rights violations be heldaccountable.Press the Government of Burundi to end allpolitically-motivated arrests and other forms of harassment of oppositionparty members.Ensure the presence of national and international electionobservers who are on the ground months in advance of the 2010 elections tomonitor any potential election-related human rights abuses.Support the development of an effective, independentjudiciary by monitoring cases of executive interference in the judiciaryand supporting the training of independent judges.IV. BackgroundLong Road to PeaceFrom 1993 through 2003, the Tutsi-dominated government andarmy fought rebel groups generally identified with the Hutu, the majoritypeople of Burundi. The two principal Hutu rebelgroups, CNDD-FDD andPalipehutu-FNL[2],sometimes fought each other as well as attacking government targets.[3]All parties to the conflict committed grave violations of internationalhumanitarian law.[4]After peace accords in late 2003[5],the CNDD-FDD joined the government and in elections in July and August 2005 wonboth a parliamentary majority and the presidency, installing Pierre Nkurunzizaas president. He promised that Burundi would be a country with the rule of lawwhere human rights are respected. However, by October 2005, the CNDD-FDDgovernment had been responsible for the extrajudicial execution, torture, andarrest of members of Palipehutu-FNL, which had not yet joined a peace process.For its part, Palipehutu-FNL assassinated local CNDD-FDD officials andcivilians suspected of supporting the government.[6]The government and Palipehutu-FNL signed a ComprehensiveCeasefire Agreement in September 2006. A Joint Verification and MonitoringMechanism (JVMM) consisting of both parties and international stakeholders wasestablished to support the implementation of the agreement.[7]However, in July 2007 Palipehutu-FNL returned to the bush,dissatisfied with the progress of implementation talks, and the JVMM wasdissolved. After months of inconclusive talks about resuming seriousnegotiations, in April 2008 the rebels attacked military posts on the outskirtsof the capital, Bujumbura, setting off a month of combat that displacedthousands of civilians in Bujumbura Rurale and Bubanza provinces.[8]Palipehutu-FNL came under heavy pressure to resumenegotiations from international actors, including Tanzania where themovement’s leaders were based. The rebels and the government signed a newceasefire, and in late May talks resumed. The ceasefire monitoring group wasreconstituted, alongside a multinational Political Directorate to addresspolitical obstacles to ceasefire implementation.[9] South Africanpeacekeepers, operating under the auspices of the African Union, were deployedto guarantee the security of the FNL delegation throughout negotiations.[10]Talks soon stalled again, when Palipehutu-FNL refused tobecome a political party and enter the political process unless it could retainthe ethnic reference in its name. The government argued that this demand couldnot be met because the 2005 constitution and a subsequent law on politicalparties prohibit parties that promote “ethnic exclusion.”[11]The movement also sought half of the government ministries, another demandimpossible to satisfy because the constitution provides that ministry-levelpositions be delegated proportionally to a party’s electoral success.[12]The peace process advanced when Palipehutu-FNL agreed inDecember 2008 to the former demand and in January 2009, changed its name tosimply “FNL,” in order to begin the process of registration as apolitical party. The government, in turn, agreed to release FNL“political and war prisoners.”[13] Donors,principally Belgium, contributed to the construction of a large camp to housecombatants as they enter the process of disarmament, demobilization, andreintegration (DDR).In mid-April the government and the FNL reached an agreementaccording to which 3,500 FNL combatants would be integrated into the nationalpolice and army; 5,000 would benefit from a World Bank-funded DDR program; and10,000 “militants” and 1,000 “associated women” wouldbenefit from a small (US$80) “reinsertion package” and be senthome.[14]FNL members turned in 633 weapons and began the demobilization process, and onApril 22, the Ministry of the Interior approved the FNL’s registration asa political party. The apportionment of government posts to the FNL was themajor unresolved issue in the peace process at the time of writing.During most of the period covered by this report, Burundi could not neatly be classified as a “conflict” or“post-conflict” country. Both the 2006 and 2008 ceasefires wereviolated by both parties. The FNL maintained control of significant otherwiseuninhabited portions of the Kibira and Rukoko forests in which FNL memberscommitted murders and abductions. Police and soldiers rarely entered theseareas, in part due to fear of FNL ambushes, and in part due to aninterpretation of the 2006 ceasefire agreement according to which this wouldconstitute undue harassment of the FNL.[15] However, thislimited the authorities’ ability to enforce the law and protectcivilians.In other, populated areas, most notably Bujumbura Rurale,the FNL effectively set up parallel administrations, in which they "patrolled"and at times arrested suspected criminals and meted out justice.[16]Residents also approached the FNL for conflict resolution. Police in theseareas were also reluctant to pursue FNL members who committed crimes.[17]One official told Human Rights Watch, “The police don’t really domuch about [the FNL]... they’re afraid to get involved. The police andarmy are afraid to circulate in the [hills] at night. They stay near theirpositions.”[18]The result has been a contradictory system in which crimes by armed combatantshave often gone unpunished, while police and their proxies have subjectedcivilian members and supporters of the FNL—who make for easiertargets—to beatings, arbitrary arrests, and other abuses.Provisional ImmunityIn 2003, when CNDD-FDD was still a rebel movement, itnegotiated with the government an agreement that provided both CNDD-FDDcombatants and members of the state security forces with “temporaryimmunity” from prosecution, but gave no further explanation of theconcept.[19]A subsequent law, which applied to political leaders returning from exile,clarified that temporary immunity (more often referred to in Burundi as “provisional immunity”) applied to “politically motivatedcrimes” committed between independence in 1962 and the signing of theceasefire in November 2003. The law provided no further definition of“politically-motivated” crimes; however, it explicitly excluded thecrime of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity from provisionalimmunity.[20]Similarly, as a result of negotiations between the CNDD-FDDgovernment and the FNL, a November 2006 law and subsequent presidential decreeguaranteed “provisional immunity” from prosecution to FNL memberswho had committed politically-motivated crimes from 1962 through the signing ofthe September 2006 ceasefire, excluding genocide, war crimes, and crimesagainst humanity.[21]The law specifies that provisional immunity remains in place until theestablishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a Special Tribunalin Burundi. The Government of Burundi is in principle committed by the 2000Arusha Agreement and subsequent talks with the UN to establishing a Truth andReconciliation Commission and a Special Tribunal, but progress has stalled dueto lack of political will.[22]Provisional immunity does not apply to crimes committed byany group after the September 2006 ceasefire. However, a lack of awareness ofthe law’s provisions has led some FNL members, victims, and lawenforcement officials alike to believe that crimes committed by the FNL evenafter the ceasefire cannot be prosecuted.[23] This misperceptionhas contributed to impunity for crimes committed by the FNL.Electoral StakesThe slow progress of the peace process means that it is now overlappingwith the informal start of the 2010 election campaign. The campaign does notofficially begin until a date yet to be determined by the national electoralcommission, but as early as 2008 parties began to hold mass meetings andundertake mass recruitment of new members.The multiparty system is still new to Burundi. The country was a one-party state under the Union for National Progress (Union pour leProgrès National, UPRONA) from independence until 1992, and wascontrolled by a series of Tutsi-run military dictatorships until 2001, with abrief hiatus from 1993 to 1996.[24]The electoral success of FRODEBU, a predominantly Hutu party, in 1993 set thestage for future electoral contests in which UPRONA (still predominantly Tutsi)became increasingly marginalized and parties competed for the majority Hutuvote.[25]CNDD-FDD won a sweeping victory in 2005 elections, organizedin large part by the United Nations Operation in Burundi (Opérationdes Nations Unies au Burundi, ONUB), a peacekeeping mission. In late 2006,ONUB troops left the country and the UN mission transitioned into apredominantly civilian operation, the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi (Bureau Integré des Nations unies au Burundi, BINUB). BINUB’s mandateincludes the promotion of both democracy and human rights.[26] Apolitical section works with the government and political parties onstrengthening democratic institutions, while a human rights section, fused witha pre-existing mission of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights(OHCHR) in Burundi, monitors rights abuses.[27] Another section isdedicated to security-sector reform.Despite largely peaceful elections in 2005 and ongoinginternational involvement in the lead-up to the 2010 elections, a number ofdevelopments in Burundian politics create a potentially more volatile andunpredictable situation than in the last elections. The electoral outcome in2010 is much less certain than in 2005, with the largely Hutu electorate up forgrabs due to splits within CNDD-FDD, and the FNL’s transition into apolitical party capable of competing for votes. Several new political movementshave emerged, among them the Movement for Solidarity and Democracy (MSD), agroup which has attempted unsuccessfully to register as a political party sinceFebruary 2007. Both MSD and FRODEBU have successfully recruited large numbersof demobilized FDD combatants, some of whom have expressed frustration overCNDD-FDD’s inability to bring about concrete improvements in their lives.[28]Meanwhile, the membership and political influence of UPD-Zigamibanga, apreviously minor party, has grown following the absorption of a number of otherformer CNDD-FDD members. Analysts have argued that in a climate of electoraluncertainty, both the CNDD-FDD dominated government and the FNL may resort to abusesin efforts to gain the upper hand.[29]Administrative Structure of Burundi[30]Burundi is subdivided into 17 provinces. Eachprovince is run by a governor, appointed by the President (with the exceptionof Bujumbura Mairie, the capital, which is run by a mayor.) Twelve out of 16governors and the mayor of Bujumbura are members of CNDD-FDD.Each province is divided into communes, each ofwhich is run by a Communal Administrator, with the support of a CommunalCouncil of 25 members. Communal council members were elected by popular vote,from block lists, in 2005; each council then elected the CommunalAdministrator. There are 117 communes in Burundi; the overwhelming majorityare run by CNDD-FDD members.The Communal Administrator manages public services andcommunal development projects. He or she also has authority over police basedwithin the commune.Communes are divided into two or three zones, eachrun by a chef de zone.Chefs de zone are nominated by theCommunal Administrator and appointed by the communal council. Their functionis to assist the Communal Administrator with local administration.Zones in rural areas are further sub-divided into a numberof collines, headed by an elected colline council and a chefde colline, while urban zones are divided into quartiers, eachheaded by an elected council and chef de quartier. The collineor quartier is the smallest administrative unit recognized by law,though even smaller informal structures exist. Officials at the collineor quartier level are primarily responsible for development projectsand conflict resolution.V. Settling of Scores: Human Rights Abuses in thePower Struggle between CNDD-FDD and the FNL“Both sides use the logic of the gun”—JF, a community worker in Bujumbura, describingCNDD-FDD and FNL using intimidation to gain political power.[31]The current Burundian government has a history dating backto its election in 2005 of perpetrating human rights violations againstsuspected Palipehutu-FNL members–including members of their civilianyouth league, the Patriotic Hutu Youth (Jeunesse Patriotique Hutu, JPH).[32]Human Rights Watch documented extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, arbitraryarrests, and threats against suspected rebel supporters by Burundian securityforces and their proxies, most notably the SNR and former FDD combatants (knownas démobilisés, see text box II), in 2005 and 2006.[33]Such incidents diminished after the signing of the September 2006 ceasefire,only to recommence in late 2007 after Palipehutu-FNL returned to the bush.Police were also increasingly responsible for abuses. For example, in a seriesof events in October 2007 previously documented by Human Rights Watch, policetortured and ill-treated over 20 detainees in a clandestine jail in Muramvyaprovince; many of them were accused of being FNL members.[34]“Démobilisés” and PartisanViolence in Burundi [35]“Démobilisé”is a French term that refers to any former combatant who has gone through ademobilization program and returned to civilian life. In Burundi, tens ofthousands of combatants, from various rebel movements as well as the formerarmy, were demobilized through a World Bank funded program beginning in 2004.The program provided them with start-up materials for small businesses such ashair-cutting and carpentry.Many démobiliséscomplained that the funds were insufficient, and others said they neverreceived packages at all. The result: thousands of underemployed orunemployed youth with little education or work experience other than thatreceived on the battlefield, loosely organized into groups, but lacking inpurpose.Asubstantial number of démobilisés from CNDD-FDD wererecruited by the intelligence service (SNR). Some became full-timeintelligence agents, but most worked as occasional informants. Some of thelatter also received pay to carry out one-off “missions,”including killings and acts of intimidation documented by Human Rights Watchin 2005 and 2006.Other FDD démobilisésjoined the CNDD-FDD youth league, and have recently been accused of carryingout acts of intimidation in this capacity, particularly in the rural areas.Still others have joined the FNL, with the hopes of receiving a seconddemobilization package.Manyformer combatants from all sides in the war did not turn in their weapons.Victims often complain of FDD démobilisés who are armedwith pistols, grenades, and occasionallyKalashnikovs.Many démobilisésreturned to civilian life with relative success and are not known to beengaged in any criminal activity. But as a social category démobilisésnonetheless constitute a volatile, easily manipulated group.Theparticular démobilisés discussed in this report aremembers of loosely organized groups of former FDD combatants, who work in aninformal capacity with police, intelligence agents, or CNDD-FDD party leadersto carry out acts of violence and repression. This does not exclude thepossibility that some acts of violence are carried out on their owninitiative, as in personal cases of score-settling.In January 2008 Human Rights Watch received further reportsof collaboration between SNR officials, certain police officers, and démobilisésbased in the Bujumbura neighborhoods of Kanyosha, Kinama, and Kamenge.Residents reported that SNR officials were distributing weapons to démobilisés.[36]This was denied by the SNR, but Human Rights Watch found evidence of both SNRand police officials relying heavily on démobilisés toprovide information and carry out “arrests” of suspects, and that anumber of démobilisés were armed. The relationship betweendémobilisés and state agents varied in different locations.One communal administrator, when asked why police had neverattempted to disarm the groups, explained, “Because they work together.When they see something, they tell the police, and the police intervene.”[37]An official in a different commune linked the démobilisés tothe SNR rather than the police, complaining, “There is a problem here ofmanaging the démobilisés who work with the [SNR].... Theyare a corps who walks over the police; the police are afraid of them.”[38]From January through March of 2008, Palipehutu-FNL andCNDD-FDD partisans faced off in a series of apparent tit-for-tat killings andassaults. Démobilisés were both victims and perpetratorsof attacks. Similar patterns emerged, this time in rural Burundi, in December 2008.The five case studies presented in this chapter documenthuman rights abuses linked to a series of attacks and reprisals by FNL andCNDD-FDD members in and around Bujumbura and in the rural communes of Kayogoro(Makamba province), Nyamurenza (Ngozi province), and Nyabikere (Karusiprovince). These do not represent the totality of incidents around the country,but these areas were notable for the use of extreme violence in the form ofkillings and grenade attacks. Human Rights Watch also received reports of theabuse of FNL members— most frequently arbitrary arrests at timesaccompanied by beatings—and the burning of CNDD-FDD meeting places fromseveral other places.[39]In all five case studies, FNL members carried out crimes.Most of these took place in territory clearly controlled by government.However, rather than effectively using the justice system to prosecute crimes,state agents generally responded by carrying out human rights violationsagainst suspects.Case Study 1: Violencein and around Bujumbura, January-March 2008In late December 2007 rumors circulated that the FNL wouldattack Bujumbura on January 1, 2008, after the expiration of a deadline set byinternational facilitators for returning to peace talks. One FNL member wasarrested in Bujumbura on January 1 and publicly accused by the policespokesperson of planning military attacks, but these attacks nevermaterialized.[40]Political rhetoric over this period became heated, with the circulation ofanonymous written tracts threatening members of both CNDD-FDD and theFNL.  A cycle of individual targeted killings began in and around Bujumbura, involving both CNDD-FDD and FNL supporters (including members of JPH).While it was unclear the extent to which assailants wereacting on superior orders, at a minimum both sides seemed to enjoy impunity.Police rarely pursued CNDD-FDD supporters linked to violence and in some casesprotected them. As one Kinama resident explained, “Both groups havestarted to attack each other. But the démobilisés benefitfrom the support of the police. When [the démobilisés] seea JPH, they chase them and trap them.”[41]However, police were equally ineffective in carrying outthorough investigations of FNL members actually suspected of crimes. Due to acombination of fear, incompetence, and lack of will, in most cases they failedto arrest perpetrators. Instead, they often responded with arbitrary arrestsand other human rights abuses against FNL members, as documented below.On January 2, 2008, a Palipehutu-FNL “politicalmobilizer” named Emmanuel, known as “Papillon,” was killed inKanyosha just outside Bujumbura.[42]The Burundian human rights organization Ligue Iteka identified the perpetratorsas démobilisés. Ligue Iteka reported that the sameperpetrators shot and gravely injured another FNL member in a nearby area thefollowing day and on January 6 they unsuccessfully sought a third FNL member.[43]The following week, a series of attacks took place againstCNDD-FDD members in Bujumbura’s northern neighborhoods and ruraloutskirts, areas in which the FNL enjoys strong support. Between January 15 and18, 2008, an SNR agent and two local CNDD-FDD officials, one of whom waskilled—all of them démobilisés—were shot inthe Bujumbura neighborhoods of Kinama and Kamenge.[44]The FNL denied responsibility.[45]Four people affiliated with the FNL were killed over thefollowing four days (discussed below), with witnesses attributingresponsibility to démobilisés affiliated with the policeand intelligence service.[46]The FNL then appeared to retaliate. Over the next two weeks, three localCNDD-FDD officials in Bubanza and Bujumbura Rurale provinces were killed. Atleast one of the officials had a long history of problems with FNL members inhis commune, who had beaten him in 2007 when he refused to attend a meeting.[47]There were subsequent killings and assaults in and near Bujumbura of persons associated with CNDD-FDD. On February 2, 2008, an SNR agent and démobiliséin Kanyosha, Diomède Sindiwenumwe, known as “Rumpu,” wasseriously injured in a shooting attributed to the FNL by local officials andKanyosha residents.[48]In mid-February, three police officers were killed when approximately 50 FNLarmed with Kalashnikovs and grenades attacked the home of PhilibertNkundwanabake, the administrator of Rugazi commune in Bubanza.[49]The Killing of EmmanuelMinani, Jospin Nzeyimana, Timothé Ngendabanka, and FrédianeNiyonkuru by CNDD-FDD SupportersTwo sets of killings in late January 2008 targetedindividuals affiliated with the FNL. In the first case, Emmanuel Minani, anurse and civilian FNL member widely known as “Papa Lolo,” was shotdead in Kinama along with his twelve-year-old son Jospin Nzeyimana.[50]Earlier in the month, neighbors had told Minani they had heard he was on a listof people to be killed.[51]On January 20, LN, a family member, observed young men clad in hats andsunglasses pass by the house several times just before the killing, andrecognized among them a police officer from the Presidential guard who is aformer FDD combatant. She left the house briefly to walk a guest home, heardgunshots on her way back and found Minani dead and his 12-year-old son mortallywounded. Police arrived a moment later, but did not pursue the perpetrators,who had fled in the direction from which the police arrived.LN gave an interview to a Burundian radio station, namingthe perpetrator she had recognized, but he was never called in for questioning.She was afraid to press charges, believing the police to be complicit.[52]Two days later, on January 22, Timothé Ngendabankaand Frediane Niyonkuru were killed in Kamenge. Their nephew was a former FNLcombatant. A few months prior to the double murder, an SNR agent living in theneighborhood accused Ngendabanka of FNL activity, referring to the compound as“an FNL camp,” and telling him “I’m going toexterminate you.”[53]The night of the murder, TB, who occupied a house in thesame compound, said he watched in terror through the crack under his door as aman in boots and a police uniform approached the house and demanded that thedoor be opened, and then fired on the door. When Ngendabanka and Niyonkurufinally emerged, the man shot and killed them. Niyonkuru was killed while holdingher baby in her arms; the infant was grazed by a bullet. According to TB, apolice vehicle came about 25 minutes later. When he told police that theassailant had just left, police said “That’s not our job.”TB said he recognized the assailant’s voice as that ofthe SNR agent who had previously threatened Ngendabanka. He said the policenever returned to investigate the killing and that he was afraid to file acomplaint.[54]The Killing of FreddyNkunzwenimana by FNL MembersOn March 28, FNL members killed Freddy Nkunzwenimana, aformer FNL member who joined CNDD-FDD in late 2007. After leaving the FNL, hehad moved into a house occupied by démobilisés in Kinama,who were known for harassment of Palipehutu-FNL members. He was suspected ofinforming on his former colleagues. The day of the shooting, Nkunzwenimana hadin fact met with police authorities in this capacity.[55]Nkunzwenimana was shot multiple times on a Kinama street inbroad daylight and succumbed to his injuries two weeks later. CF, a family memberwho visited him in the hospital, heard his account of the assault before hedied:When he joined the CNDD-FDD, his friends fromPalipehutu-FNL didn’t appreciate it. They started to look for him. ... Itwas his friends from Palipehutu-FNL who shot him.... Freddy saw [one of thesefriends] with a gun and said “Why do you want to kill me?” [Thefriend] shot him three times in the thigh, took his phone, and fled.[56]In interviews with Human Rights Watch, FNL combatants andJPH members acknowledged that their forces in Kinama had killed Nkunzwenimana.[57]One explained, “The FNL looked for him because he knew many of theirsecrets. That’s why they shot him.”[58]FNL spokesperson Habimana denied responsibility, and an FNL combatant familiarwith the case said that the killers had likely acted on their own initiative tosettle scores.[59]Aftermath: The Killingof Daneck Koriciza by Police, August 2008On August 24, 2008, police from the 3rd RapidMobile Intervention Group (Groupement Mobile d’Intervention Rapide,GMIR) based at Camp Socarti in Bujumbura, shot dead Daneck Koriciza, a suspectin the killing of Freddy Nkunzwenimana. Daneck, an FNL member, had justreturned home after joining combatants in the bush several months earlier.Witnesses said that on learning he had returned to Bujumbura, police soughtDaneck out and killed him near his uncle’s house in Kinama. In a seriesof contradictory accounts, the police claimed that Daneck shot first, a claimrepudiated by witnesses.[60]Residents of Kinama and neighboring communes reported thatfollowing Koriciza’s death, démobilisés began tohunt JPH and FNL members associated with him. In November, PC, a young man whowas close to the JPH, told Human Rights Watch that two of these formercombatants, armed with pistols, trapped and attempted to “arrest”him on the street. He was freed when local residents emerged from their homesand demanded his release, but told Human Rights Watch in a subsequent telephoneinterview that he had gone into hiding, fearing for his life.[61]Case Study 2: FNLAttacks, Arbitrary Arrests, and Ill-Treatment by the Government in ResponseCeasefire Collapse andIncreased HarassmentThe number of arrests and cases of ill-treatment of allegedFNL rebels, frequent in late 2005 and early 2006, reduced after the signing ofthe September 2006 Ceasefire Agreement.[62] The ceasefirecreated a legal status for the rebels, in effect prohibiting the arrest ofindividuals on the basis of FNL membership alone.[63]However, this provision was not incorporated into Burundian law, whichcontributed to confusion on the part of some police and judicial officials, andallowed willful misinterpretation on the part of others. Although after theceasefire FNL members enjoyed “provisional immunity” for pastcrimes, some officials, in violation of the ceasefire, treated FNL membershipitself as a crime.Police and local officials arrested more allegedPalipehutu-FNL members in late 2007 after negotiations collapsed, though theceasefire agreement technically remained valid.[64]Démobiliséswere often involved in the beating, arrest, and intimidation of alleged FNLmembers, particularly in the Bujumbura urban communes of Kinama and Kamenge.For example, RG, a former child soldier who had left themovement in 2005, told Human Rights Watch how in January 2008 the SNR againbegan to harass him after several years of leaving him alone. He said,“They started looking for me all the time. My mother said they would cometo the house, surround it, and intimidate her and my little brother.” Thevarious SNR agents, police, and démobilisés who came tohis house on multiple occasions, at times armed with pistols and grenades,never presented an arrest warrant. RG dropped out of high school after agentssearched for him there and eventually fled from his home, staying with friendsor sleeping outside near a riverbank. He observed, “I’m living likean animal.”[65]Back in 2005 when he had originally left the FNL, he had been arrested by theSNR and tortured to extract information about rebel activity. He was freed thesame year and been able to return to his studies.BN, an FNL member, told Human Rights Watch that he hadabandoned combat, but was detained briefly in March 2008 on charges of FNLactivity and subsequently harassed by démobilisés. He said,“I am thinking about going back to the bush and joining the rebels againbecause I would be safer there. But I made an agreement with my church that Iwould give up combat.”[66]Human Rights Watch later learned that BN, with other former FNL combatants and civiliansupporters, did indeed return to Bujumbura Rurale to resume FNL militaryactivity.Burundian Criminal Procedure Concerning Arrests[67]TheBurundian National Police (Police Nationale du Burundi, PNB) iscomposed of four main units: the Judicial Police, Internal Security Police,Border Police, and Penitentiary Police. Only judicial police officers (officiersde la police judiciaire, OPJs) are authorized to arrest suspects, exceptin cases in which suspects are caught in the act of committing a crime. Insuch cases, any citizen can make an arrest but must be immediately transferthe suspect to police custody.Mostregular National Intelligence Service (SNR) personnel have the status of OPJ.However, SNR agents and informants who lack this status, including the many démobiliséswho work officially and unofficially for the SNR, are not authorized to carryout arrests.Communaladministrators have limited policing powers; by law, an administrator can“take any policing measure that he judges necessary to maintain orderand public security.” According to government officials consulted byHuman Rights Watch, the law is not intended to empower administrators tocarry out arrests on their own; rather, administrators, as well as governors,can requisition OPJs to arrest suspects.Oncepolice have arrested a suspect, they must immediately place him or her in arecognized jail under judicial police custody. Judicial police have sevendays to carry out investigations before charging a suspect with a crime; inexceptional cases, they may request a seven-day extension from theprosecutor. At the end of this period, police must either release a suspector file charges, at which point the detainee should be transferred to aprison and the investigation should be taken over by the Prosecutor’soffice. Once a suspect has been charged, she or he must be brought before ajudge for an initial hearing within 15 days.Resumption of Combat andMass ArrestsAs previously described, the FNL briefly resumed openhostilities in April 2008, attacking military posts around Bujumbura with guns,grenades, and mortars. They also launched mortars and rockets at Bujumbura, striking two homes and a university campus.[68] FNL combatants whowere concentrated in civilian areas, mostly in Bujumbura Rurale province, alsocarried out massive looting in the course of hostilities. In at least one case,they were alleged to have burned down houses as they retreated. Local officialsand humanitarian aid organizations estimated that over 20,000 civilians weretemporarily displaced as a result of combat.[69]From April through June, the government responded with acampaign of mass arrests which was not limited to those with a direct role inhostilities. Hundreds of Palipehutu-FNL members and suspected civiliansupporters were arrested, most of them in late April and early May. Dozens wereill-treated, either at the moment of the arrest or in local jails. For example,TS, a civilian FNL sympathizer, told Human Rights Watch that unknown men incivilian clothing arrested him on the street in Bujumbura on April 29 and beathim over the head with a revolver before turning him over to police.[70]GD, an FNL combatant home visiting his wife, was stopped in the street on April23 by police together with pistol-wielding démobilisés incivilian clothing. “They all took off their belts and beat me,” hedescribed. He was taken to jail, where in May a Human Rights Watch researcherphotographed scars on his head and hands.[71]MH, a 16-year-old JPH member from Kinama, recounted:I was arrested on April 21 in Quartier Kanga, around 3 p.m.I was coming from the mosque. I was arrested by démobilisésin civilian clothing, [who] called over the police and said I was FNL. I wasbeaten badly by the police. They slapped me, there on the road, and then tookme to Kanga police post. There they beat me on my arms, hands, and face. One ofmy arms was dislocated and I had blood running from my nose.... I did not getmedical help... While beating me, they said I was FNL.He was transferred to a local jail where, he said, he wasbeaten with a baton by a judicial police officer during interrogations over thecourse of three days. He reported that he suspected financial motives on thepart of the men who arrested him, commenting,The démobilisés are always looking forthe JPH. At times they are armed with pistols, grenades, and Kalashnikovs....They look for us on their own initiative, in order to denounce us and get moneyfrom the [SNR].[72]In Makamba province, untouched by combat, then-GovernorPasteur Bucumi, a CNDD-FDD member, personally arrested five alleged FNLmembers. They later told BINUB human rights observers that the governor and hispolice guard had beaten them.[73]The illegal and abusive nature of these arrests spurred the Representative ofthe High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi to send a letter to theMinister of Interior, denouncing the governor’s role in the arrests andill-treatment.[74]The Governor has not been sanctioned for the abuses.Abusive arrests continued even after the Palipehutu-FNLleadership returned to Bujumbura and signed a ceasefire on May 25, 2008. On May30 hundreds of Palipehutu-FNL sympathizers poured into Bujumbura to welcome thereturn of their leader Agathon Rwasa from Tanzania. Among them were fifteen JPHmembers from Mugina commune in Cibitoke province, who extended their stay in Bujumbura to attend a JPH meeting in Kinama scheduled for May 31. Just after beginningtheir meeting, they were surrounded by men in civilian clothing armed with Kalashnikovs,pistols, grenades, and bayonets. They were “arrested” andtransported to a house known to be occupied by démobilisés.[75]One, VB, recalled,They took us to [the compound] and put us in the showerroom. They started beating us, and then they took off our clothes and beat usmore... They said “We are Peter’s soldiers” [an apparent referenceto President Nkurunziza] while they were beating us. They accused us of goingto join the rebellion. We denied this, and said we were just there for ameeting to talk about food collection, whether it should continue. We werekicked and beaten with batons and with the butts of guns. They took off all ourclothes and took our phones and everything.[76]Another, GN, told Human Rights Watch:There were nine who came to arrest us, but when we arrivedat the house there were others, a big group of them. They had pistols andKalashnikovs, and some even had bayonets on their Kalashnikovs. They took usinto the little house and started to beat us with batons and belts... Onesliced me with a bayonet on the stomach, and they also slapped me in the face.One of the bandits called the Police Commissioner to comeand arrest us. Others disagreed. They said “You shouldn’t havecalled him; we could have done what we normally do, we could have killed thesepeople. Now we have to wait for the police to come.”The police finally came, took us on foot to the zone, andput us in jail.... We were in jail for three days with no food or water, andthen the Chef de Zone gave us 500 Fbu for food [approximately US$0.50]. Twodays later, on Friday, [BINUB human rights observers] came to see us and wewere freed.[77]The police held the victims under the purported charge of“FNL membership,” which is not a crime under Burundian law. Victimstold Human Rights Watch that police denied them medical care even though theyknew they had been beaten. GN said, “The police did nothing to help us.We had the impression that the police work with [the assailants].”[78]Both Human Rights Watch and BINUB documented scars resembling baton markings onthe victims’ backs, and a laceration on the stomach of one.[79]The same démobilisés were involved inthe beating of a civilian Palipehutu-FNL member who was set up in an SNR gunsting in June. An acquaintance called the Palipehutu-FNL member and said he had“a gun to give to the party.” The victim agreed to meet hisacquaintance at an address in Kinama to pick up the gun. He arrived at thehouse occupied by the démobilisés and was invited in. Herecalled:In the house were four people, with three Kalashnikovs andone R-4. They arrested me, took my phone and 80,000 Fbu[80],[and] hit me with a steel cable. While they were beating me, they asked why Icollaborated with Palipehutu-FNL. I was also beaten with the butt of a gunacross my head. I was beaten for about one hour.[81]After the beating, the men telephoned the SNR. An SNRofficial then picked up the victim and transported him to the jail at the SNRheadquarters in Bujumbura.[82]Human Rights Watch and BINUB officials visited the victim there, when theyobserved and photographed scars on his back.Detention asIntimidationFor several months after the April 2008 FNL attacks, policeand other officials in provinces including Bujumbura, Bujumbura Rurale,Cankuzo, Cibitoke, Gitega, Kayanza, Mwaro, Muyinga, and Ngozi explicitly useddetention as a preemptive intimidation strategy to deter potential FNLsympathizers from joining combat.[83]Some arrests were carried out by communal and provincial authorities, who hadno authority to do so.In Cibitoke province, where there was no combat, GovernorZéphirin Barutwanayo, a CNDD-FDD member, ordered the arrest of formerFNL members, in his words, “to intimidate them into not [taking part in]combat in other areas.” He added, “The administration arrestspeople when we suspect something, to get information. We question them and theydeny everything. We give them time to reflect, then question them again.You’re right that from the point of view of human rights, it’s notlegal, but we have to address their political tendencies.”[84]In June 2008 two JPH members from Kinama, Bujumbura, who hadbriefly joined the FNL combatants but had left when they discovered that thecombatants faced a shortage of food, were pursued by police from Camp Socarti on their return home, even though there was no legal basis for arresting JPHor FNL members who had returned from the battlefield.[85]Police at Camp Socarti also detained two alleged Palipehutu-FNL members for twoweeks in mid-July, violating Burundi’s criminal procedure code by notbringing them before a judicial police officer. The detainees were thentransferred to the municipal jail, where they spent two more weeks before beingreleased without charge.[86]By late July 2008, most alleged Palipehutu-FNL members inillegal conditions of detention had been released, but occasional arbitraryarrests continued through April 2009.[87]In Mwaro province, approximately 16 Palipehutu-FNL members were held in ashipping container converted into a clandestine detention cell for two weeks inmid-November, with no access to family members, lawyers, or other visitors. Adetainee who had been held in the container for 10 days, before beingtransferred to an official jail, notified a local human rights association ofits existence.[88]Provincial Police Commissioner Fidèle Nsengiyumva denied that they hadbeen detained in this container and refused access to Human Rights Watch,representatives of the local human rights association, and FNL leaders who wereauthorized by the Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism to look intohuman rights abuses against their members as part of the ceasefireimplementation agreement.[89]FDN Abuses [90]There is along history of abuses by the army in Burundi. Since the formation of theNational Defense Forces (Forces de la Défense Nationale, FDN)in 2004, which integrated government soldiers, gendarmes, and former rebels,the most notorious abuse on record is the killing of 31 civilians in Muyingain mid-2006. The victims, most or all of them suspected of FNL involvement,were detained in a military camp before being taken out of the camp in aseries of convoys, killed, and dumped in the Ruvubu River.The FDNhas since undertaken efforts to discipline soldiers responsible for abuses.Human Rights Watch received only a few reports of conduct of FDN soldiers inthe course of hostilities in April and May 2008 inconsistent with humanrights principles. However, in some cases soldiers did play a role inunlawful arrests in which people were also subjected to beatings and otherill-treatment. In June 2008 Human Rights Watch encountered two detainees atthe municipal jail who said they had been arrested and ill-treated bysoldiers.One ofthem said he was arrested by a military officer in Bujumbura who recognizedhim as a one-time combatant, held at a military camp for four days, andbeaten by soldiers with batons before being transferred into police custody.He recounted, “I was beaten the day of the arrest and the next day, onmy legs, arms, stomach and back. My whole body swelled up.” A HumanRights Watch researcher documented and photographed scars on the body of asecond detainee, who said she had been beaten by FDN soldiers.BINUBhuman rights officials reported a case of 17 young women, all alleged JPHmembers, arrested and beaten by FDN troops in Isale commune, Bujumbura Ruraleprovince, on April 29. They were subsequently freed after the intervention ofa local official. No FDN soldiers were held accountable for any of thebeatings.Case Study 3: Violence in Kayogoro Commune, MakambaProvince, December 2008 to January 2009On December 4, 2008, the Palipehutu-FNL committed tochanging its name in order to be eligible to register as a political party.Leaders agreed to consult with their base in order to choose a new name, whilethe government agreed to release “political prisoners.” Ironically,at precisely that moment new evidence of political violence and human rightsabuses emerged from some of Burundi’s most remote rural communes.Many of these incidents took place following new FNLactivity in provinces far from the capital, areas that have not historicallyhad a strong FNL affiliation.[91]In some cases, local government officials, in association with CNDD-FDDmembers, responded to FNL activity, some of it criminal, by carrying out humanrights violations including beatings and arbitrary arrests.On the evenings of December 4 and 5, in Kayogoro commune,Makamba province, just a few kilometers from the Tanzanian border, unknownindividuals set fire to five thatched-roof structures used as“headquarters” for local-level chapters of the CNDD-FDD. Localadministrative and police officials suspected the FNL. They also reported thatarmed FNL members visited households throughout the commune on the evening ofDecember 5, attempting to intimidate residents into attending an FNL meetingscheduled for December 6.[92]On the morning of December 6, a Saturday, FNL membersblockaded roads in the small population center of Kibirizi. They attempted toforce residents to attend their meeting, rather than participating in mandatory“communal work,” a policy instituted by President Nkurunziza butwidely boycotted.[93]About 400 individuals showed up at the meeting, held in afield near Kibirizi. Some FNL members arrived armed with spears, clubs, andmachetes. PN, an FNL member, told Human Rights Watch that the weapons wereintended to “assure their safety.”[94] Indeed, the statedintentions behind the meeting did not seem malicious; FNL sympathizers wishedto discuss the decision to change their movement’s name.[95]However, FNL members at the meeting proceeded to detain and briefly holdhostage SK, a civilian who walked by (they suspected he was a spy) and twopolice officers who arrived to shut down the meeting. A third police officerescaped to seek reinforcements. When they arrived, participants fled in alldirections.[96]Back in Kibirizi center, police attempted to identify thosewho had been at the meeting. They rounded up 20 men and temporarily detainedthem in an unfinished house guarded by two police officers. A crowd of localcitizens who opposed the FNL’s acts of intimidation formed around thehouse. Led by the communal and provincial CNDD-FDD representatives, a group of démobiliséspulled the detainees out of the house, beat them, and tied their arms behindtheir backs.[97]A number of victims and witnesses reported that the CommunalAdministrator (a CNDD-FDD member), the police chief, and the two other policeofficers stood by and watched as the detainees were beaten. The detainees wereeventually loaded into a police truck and transferred to a local jail.[98]Both officials denied the accusations, claiming they had arrived to find“the population” beating the detainees, and that it was theirintervention that put an end to it.[99]However, the two officials provided Human Rights Watch with entirelycontradictory versions of events that failed to clarify their whereaboutsduring the assaults.[100]Police opened investigations into the alleged FNLmembers’ activities, but released them after several weeks. On the urgingof Avocats Sans Frontières, police also opened an investigationinto the ill-treatment of the detainees. The provincial and communal presidentsof CNDD-FDD were interrogated, but not arrested. The investigation is currentlyongoing.[101]On January 11 a Burundian radio station reported that agroup of armed ex-FDD combatants in Kayogoro had begun “nighttimepatrols” in mid-December, visiting houses and threatening residents whowere not CNDD-FDD members.[102]Human Rights Watch received subsequent reports that participants were armedwith guns and grenades and carried out illegal arrests of suspects, who weredetained in Bigina zone—not an official jail—before being freed ortransferred to police custody.[103]On January 18 unidentified assailants attacked the house ofthe Kayogoro Communal Administrator with grenades and gunshots.[104]He was the second CNDD-FDD administrator to be attacked in the course of a week(see also Case Study 4, below).[105]Case Study 4: Violence in Nyamurenza Commune, NgoziProvince, January 2009On the night of December 19, 2008, 19 thatched-roofstructures used as meeting places by CNDD-FDD were burned in six differentprovinces throughout the country.[106]These simultaneous acts of symbolic violence raised local-level tensionsbetween the CNDD-FDD and the FNL, who like in the earlier arson attacks weresuspected to be responsible.[107]On December 25 FNL members held a meeting in Nyamurenza.[108]According to the Communal Administrator, the purpose of the meeting was todiscuss organizing a larger meeting to consult on the changing of the namePalipehutu-FNL.[109]However, the meeting was held at night—against the law in Burundi—and no local authorities were notified.The Communal Administrator (a CNDD-FDD member) and the localpolice chief (a former FDD combatant)—interviewed separately—toldHuman Rights Watch that “the population” proceeded to arrest FNLmembers present at the meeting, which according to the police chief took placein a coffee field, and according to the administrator, took place at a privateresidence. Both claimed that when they arrived at the location where themeeting had allegedly taken place, they found the suspected FNL members hadalready been beaten and tied up by a large group of local residents.[110]The administrator and police chief took most of them to jail in the communalvehicle, though at least one victim, YI, was released because of theseriousness of his injuries: his head had been split open by a piece of wood.[111]Others were treated for their injuries at a local clinic in the morning.[112]As in Kayogoro, the Administrator and police chief claimedto have intervened to stop the violence of the mob. According to an internalBINUB report, the police chief told BINUB investigators the beatings were soserious that had he not intervened, “local officials might have committedthe irreparable.”[113]Victims, all of whom were released from jail betweenDecember 26 and January 14, told a different story. Several said they werearrested by police along with the chef de colline and the local levelhead of the CNDD-FDD. They said they were taken to the Kinyovu police post, andbeaten by local CNDD-FDD representatives, a local school director who is amember of CNDD-FDD, the Communal Administrator, and the police chief. Accordingto DM, one of the victims, the beatings became so severe that at one point,“The police told the Communal Administrator to stop beating people. Theysaid ‘If you kill people at our post, we’re the ones who will payfor it.’”[114]The police chief, who denied being present during thebeatings, did acknowledge that when he arrived, the local CNDD-FDDrepresentatives and the school director were present among the“crowd” that had carried out the arrests. He said he took no stepsto identify or arrest the individuals who had beaten the detainees, claiming hewas “new” to his job and unprepared to carry out on-the-spotinvestigations. However, he had been in his current position for a year and hadbeen a police officer since 2005.[115]A local government official not implicated in the incidenttold a representative of the Burundian human rights organization APRODH that hehad evidence supporting the victims’ version, according to which CNDD-FDDrepresentatives, the Communal Administrator, and the police chief were allresponsible for the beatings. The local official told APRODH he could not speakout publicly for fear that he would lose his post.[116]Following the arrests, rumors began to circulate that theFNL had threatened to kill the communal CNDD-FDD president and vice-president,the Communal Administrator, the chef de colline, and the police chief inrevenge for the brutal arrests. According to the Communal Administrator, onJanuary 5, an FNL leader, CN, personally threatened communal CNDD-FDDvice-president Anthère Ntarundenga, named by victims as having played akey role in the beatings.[117]On January 7 while returning home from a meeting in Ngozi on a motorcycleNtarundenga was shot four times outside his gate and died on the spot.[118]Four suspects in the murder were arrested on January 9, someof them affiliated with the FNL. Two were released and two remained in custodyat Ngozi jail for investigations as of this writing; two additional suspectswere arrested on January 17 and detained in Nyamurenza.[119]FNL leaders in Bujumbura promised to cooperate with local authorities inidentifying and turning over the perpetrators, if they are in fact FNL members.[120]When contacted by Human Rights Watch, CN, the FNL leadercited by the Communal Administrator denied personal involvement in the case. Hesaid he did not know the victim and had not been in Nyamurenza for a long time.[121]Case Study 5: Violencein Nyabikere commune, Karusi Province, March 2008 and January 2009On March 7, 2008, Libère Ntawukirumwansi, a JPHmember, was killed at his home in Nyabikere commune, Karusi province. Witnessessaid that in previous months the Communal Administrator, a CNDD-FDD member, hadpublicly stated that FNL members in the commune, including Libère who wasmentioned by name, should be “put down” and“decapitated.”[122]AR, a neighbor, told Human Rights Watch that the day beforethe killing, an unidentified man on a motorcycle asked her to identifyLibère’s house. She did so; minutes later, the man returned withthe Administrator and pointed out the house to him.[123]According to the victim’s father,The day of the killing, my son came home at 7 p.m. He saidpeople had assaulted him on the way home. He fought them. One had on a policeuniform. He didn’t know them. At 9 p.m., after he ate, he went to bed.Then [someone] threw a grenade over the wall into his room... When I heard thegrenade, I went into my son’s room to see what happened. I found my sonwith his legs completely cut off.[124]Two friends of Ntawukirumwansi provided interviews to a Bujumbura radio station after the killing, accusing the Communal Administrator of havingordered it.[125]Approached by Human Rights Watch, the Administrator refused to discuss theincident, saying, “There are no problems in Nyabikere.”[126]Police identified the Administrator as the primary suspect and transferred thecase to the Gitega Prosecutor’s Office for further investigations.[127]The Administrator was not arrested, however.According to a Nyabikere resident, in July 2008 several JPHmembers fled to join FNL members in the Kibira forest after continued threatsfrom the Administrator.[128]On December 19 unknown assailants set fire to CNDD-FDDmeeting houses in Nyabikere commune, part of the series of simultaneous attacksthroughout the country.[129]On January 11, 2009, the Governor of Karusi, a CNDD-FDDmember, held a meeting in Nyabikere in which he echoed theAdministrator’s threats against FNL members, again citing names. Two dayslater, unknown individuals threw grenades at the homes of two FNL members. Thefollowing day, grenades were thrown at the CNDD-FDD Administrator’shouse, injuring him and four other people. Meanwhile, the house of another FNLmember was also attacked, though no one was injured.[130]On the night of January 14 and the morning of January 15,2009, five young men, three of them FNL members on “leave”[131],were arrested in conjunction with the attack on the Administrator’shouse. The Governor and his police bodyguards carried out the arrests, eventhough they had no legal authority to do so. Two of the detainees were thosewho spoke to a radio station about their friend’s death in March 2008,and at least three of them were among those whose names had been cited by theGovernor.[132]The detainees told Human Rights Watch they were beaten and tied up by theGovernor and his police guard before being transferred to Karusi jail and thenGitega prison. According to one, the Governor told his police guard,“Give these imbeciles a good beating.”  Another detainee saidhe was spitting up blood and had difficulty seeing through his right eye.[133]At the time of writing, the Karusi prosecutor was investigating the attacks onthe Administrator’s house, and the suspects arrested in relation to theattack on the Administrator remained in detention. The prosecutor did notinvestigate the attacks on the FNL members’ houses.[134]BINUB human rights officers carried out investigations inNyabikere and largely confirmed the detainees’ version of events,although one official source told them the Governor arrested FNL members whowere “in a clandestine meeting.”[135] However, thedetainees said two were stopped at a vehicle checkpoint, while others werearrested at their workplaces.[136]In any case, the arrests were illegal as they were carried out by the Governorand others with no authority to do so.VI. FNL Abuses:Repression as Political StrategyFNL leaders, like their government and CNDD-FDD counterparts, have authorized killings and other acts of violence, including abductions, and havefailed to prevent their members from committing other crimes. They have carriedout armed attacks on camps housing alleged “dissident” members inorder to send a political message that they do not tolerate the existence ofthese groups. They have abducted police, soldiers, intelligence agents, andcivilians close to CNDD-FDD, killing at least one, while others have been heldas hostages. Even after the FNL began the process of transformation into apolitical party in early 2009, they murdered one civilian JPH member andabducted and tortured another because the two had expressed dissenting views.Until March 2009 FNL leaders did not cooperate with policeto arrest FNL members suspected of criminal activity, nor did they takesufficient steps to discipline FNL members implicated in murders or robberies.However, in a welcome development towards the end of March, this policy appearsto have changed as leaders assisted police in arresting several FNL combatantswho were wanted for crimes, among them, Isaac Manirakiza (aka“Sénégalais”), the Commander of the Rukoko camp.[137]However, as yet no one has been arrested for the crimes described in thischapter. None of these crimes qualify for “provisional immunity,”as they all occurred after the ceasefire agreement of September 2006.Armed Attacks on Dissident Combatants as“Self-Defense”In late 2007 and early 2008, the FNL carried out killings inorder to intimidate or eliminate what it perceived as “competition.”Though the FNL has denied responsibility for killings of individuals close tothe CNDD-FDD described in the case studies above, it has acknowledgedresponsibility for a series of attacks carried out on a group known in Burundi as the “alleged FNL dissidents.” This group claimed to have left theFNL in order to pursue peace.[138]FNLspokesperson Pasteur Habimana has characterized attacks on themas “self-defense,” because the group’s existence was seen asa threat to Palipehutu-FNL’s identity.[139]In August 2007, shortly after the FNL left ceasefire talks,an armed group claiming to be composed of FNL fighters established a makeshiftcamp in the Bujumbura suburb of Buterere.[140] They said thatthey rejected the leadership of Agathon Rwasa and, as the “true”FNL, wanted to continue negotiations.[141] The main FNL saidthe group did not consist of real FNL fighters and said they had been recruitedby the government to provide a compliant partner in negotiations.[142]In September and October 2007, the FNL attacked the allegeddissidents on multiple occasions, first in Buterere and again after the vastmajority turned in their weapons and moved to camps protected by FDN soldiersand African Union (AU) peacekeeping troops.[143] The attacks ondissident camps at Buterere on September 3, Rugazi on September 25, andGakungwe on October 21 killed 29 unarmed dissidents and one civilian. AtGakungwe, FNL fighters decapitated dissidents and left their heads along theroad, a clear message to dissidents or potential defectors.[144]In addition to military attacks on the camps, the dissidentsalso said the FNL had carried out a series of targeted assassinations of theirmembers, though the FNL has denied this claim.[145]On October 2, 2007, FNL fighters killed eight combatants in the Kibiraattempting to defect from the movement.[146] On October 13unidentified assailants fired on dissident leaders who were leaving a meetingat the Hotel Albatross in Bujumbura, killing three and seriously wounding another.[147]According to a dissident leader, at least four other dissidents were killedbetween November 2007 and March 2008.[148] Policeinvestigations into these various attacks did not result in any criminalcharges.FNL spokesperson Pasteur Habimana accepted responsibilityfor attacks on the camps. He made the broad claim that these operations were“legitimate self-defense,” essential to assuring exclusive use ofthe name Palipehutu-FNL for his group, and essential for protecting theirleader Rwasa. According to Habimana, the government was responsible forincreasing the number of dissidents and locating dissident camps near FNLposts, measures intended to weaken his movement.[149]Regardless of whether the government had encouraged theformation of the FNL dissidents, FNL attacks and the killing of unarmed personsconstitute serious crimes. They also set a dangerous precedent, sending amessage to FNL troops that even in times of relative peace, violence was anacceptable solution to political disagreement.Abductions and Attackson CiviliansFNL members have also been responsible for a number ofabductions of civilians, police officers, and soldiers. Abductees have almostinvariably been taken into the Rukoko or Kibira forests, areas controlled bythe FNL. Some abductions were apparently ordered by the FNL leadership, astheir releases were secured by high-level negotiations in Dar es Salaam.[150]Others, especially many of the more recent cases, appear to have been carriedout without the leadership’s knowledge, suggesting a lack of disciplinewithin FNL ranks. In the past, the FNL has exercised tight control from thecenter. However, this control decreased in late 2007 and early 2008, whenincreased numbers of rapes, cases of assault, and robberies were alsoattributed to FNL members, many of them recent recruits.[151]The police and prosecutors’ unwillingness or inability to penetrate themovement allowed such crimes to be carried out with impunity.[152]The FNL abducted at least four civilians and several policeofficers and soldiers in late 2007 and early 2008 with a view to exchangingthem for FNL fighters in official custody. For example, LéonidasNdereyimana, a local official from Bubanza commune, was abducted in October2007 and held for two days. Elie Nzobandora and DésiréSindayigaya were abducted in December 2007 and January 2008 respectively. Theywere held in Rukoko forest until February, when their freedom was brokered by aBurundian businessman. An SNR agent, Samuel Baphumeko, and an FDN soldier,Ngomirakiza, were being held in Rukoko at the same time as Nzobandora andSindayigaya.[153]The teenage daughter of a CNDD-FDD official in Musigati commune, Bubanzaprovince, was abducted in February 2008. She was beaten and held hostage in theKibira forest for two days until her father paid a ransom.[154]In Kanyosha commune in Bujumbura, also in February 2008, FNLmembers abducted VG and two other men because they were suspected of workingfor the SNR. When an FNL member present recognized one of the victims andconfirmed that he did not work for the SNR, the men were released.[155]Abductions ceased temporarily with the resumption ofnegotiations in May 2008 but resumed again in November, after a number ofPalipehutu-FNL members were arrested for participating in unauthorized protestson October 27. On November 13, 2008, combatants based at Kibuye colline, apre-assembly site[156]in Rugazi commune, Bubanza province, abducted a health center manager.[157]He was held until December 26 when he was freed in exchange for two FNL membersheld in Bubanza prison. Senior FNL officials in Bujumbura said they wereunaware of the hostage-taking for weeks.[158]FNL combatants were suspected of being behind the abductionof a local official, Alphonse Shikamiro, in Gihanga commune, Bubanza provinceon November 4, 2008.[159]A senior FNL official denied the movement’s responsibility, but theKibuye case demonstrated that leaders were not necessarily in control of localevents. Shikamiro’s whereabouts and state of well-being were unknown atthe time of this writing; police and administrative authorities said he wasbelieved to have been taken to the FNL base in Rukoko forest and killed.[160]Later in November, two soldiers were abducted and seriously beaten by FNLmembers demanding the release of prisoners. They were released the same dayafter intervention by an FNL commander.[161]Killings and Abductionsof JPH Members Suspected of DissentOn January 27, 2009, at a moment when peace negotiationswere moving forward and the newly renamed FNL had undertaken the process ofregistering as a political party, the Burundian radio station Radio PubliqueAfricaine (RPA) received a communiqué from a person who identifiedhimself as Gédéon Uwisezerano, who claimed to be writing onbehalf of the “Palipehutu-FNL.” He said he represented a group ofcombatants that had rejected the name change as well as other compromises madein the negotiations, and that FNL leaders Jacques Bigirimana, Pasteur Habimana,and Anatole Bacanamwo were “no longer recognized by thePalipehutu-FNL.”[162]In a subsequent interview with RPA, “Uwisezerano” (revealed to thejournalist as an alias) claimed to be supported by other FNL leaders, JonasNshimirimana and Ibrahim Ntakirutimana. He gave FNL chairman Agathon Rwasa amonth to determine which side he was on.[163]FNL leaders publicly denounced the letter in a jointtelevision appearance, and few observers of the peace process appeared to takethe letter very seriously. But on January 31 FNL combatants abducted JeanBaptiste Nsabimana, a civilian JPH member from Buterere who had publiclyquestioned the name change. FNL combatants, under the direction of FNLcommander Antoine Bariyanka (known as “Shoot” or“Shuti”), forced him into a Prado Land Cruiser, one of 40 vehiclesprovided by the South African-led facilitation for the use of the FNL duringthe peace negotiations. A South African peacekeeper was in the vehicle and observedthe abduction. Nsabimana was taken to the Rukoko forest, interrogated about hispossible role in what the FNL saw as an attempted internal coup, and tortured.[164]When contacted by a Human Rights Watch researcher several hours after theabduction, FNL spokesperson Pasteur Habimana denied knowledge of the incident,but assured the researcher that if combatants in the Rukoko had in fact takenhostages, he would ensure that they were not ill-treated.[165]Nsabimana was released a week later.In the meantime, on February 2, FNL combatants abductedAbraham Ngendakumana, another JPH member from Buterere. He was taken from hishome by approximately six combatants. A witness identified one as“Bakary.” His wife contacted the police the same night, who saidthey could not do anything because it was “an internal FNL matter.”Police officials gave her the phone number of the FNL “military chief ofstaff,” Ibrahim Ntakirutimana, whom she contacted the following day. OnFebruary 4 she received a letter signed “FNL,” warning her to“stop making noise.” On February 6 Ngendakumana’s body wasfound in Mubone zone (Buterere commune, Bujumbura), a location between thevictim’s home and the Rukoko forest. He had been decapitated.[166]FNL chief Ntakirutimana subsequently detained Bakary andanother combatant in the Rukoko, allegedly for interrogations about thekilling. Asked why they were not turned over to Burundian police or judicialauthorities, Ntakirutimana said “They are ours. We won’t turn themover until we are sure they are guilty.”[167]As of this writing, the FNL had not turned over any suspects in the killing.[168]Abuses by Alleged FNLDissidentsLike the mainstream FNL, the so-called FNL dissidents whowere victims of FNL attacks in late 2007 and early to 2008 have also failed torenounce the use of force. Shuttled around by the government, approximately3,000 dissidents were eventually settled in Randa and Buramata camps in Bubanzaprovince, where the majority have been held for a year and a half as the peaceprocess between the government and the mainstream Palipehutu-FNL moves slowlyforward.The dissidents have taken advantage of their access to armsand their anonymity in the area to commit serious crimes, including murder,rape, and robbery.[169]Dissident leaders have done little to rein in criminality or turn in suspectedoffenders to the police.Dissidents have also used force to accomplish politicalends. In February 2008 dissidents held hostage the African Union peacekeepersguarding Randa camp in order to force the African Union ambassador to meet withthem.[170]They also refused for several months to turn over a group of over 200 childsoldiers to UNICEF for demobilization. According to one UN official, theobjective of both actions was to force the UN or AU to arrange for theirinclusion in peace talks along with or instead of the main Palipehutu-FNLgroup.[171]In late April, following the short-lived resumption of combat, UNICEF won therelease of the children who were transferred to a demobilization center inGitega.[172]On April 22, 2009, the government accepted 250 dissidentsfor integration into the national police and army alongside the mainstream FNLmembers to be integrated. Others remained in the camps, and the government hadnot yet announced a policy for demobilization of the remaining dissidents as ofthis writing.[173]VII.Government Repression of Democratic Political OppositionCompetition between the ruling CNDD-FDD and the oppositionFNL is only one context of human rights abuse in Burundi. CNDD-FDD officialshave also perpetrated human rights violations against democratic politicalopponents. These have taken a variety of forms ranging from attempts torestrict political freedom, an act of dubious constitutionality barringopponents from parliament, and attacks on opposition politicians. High-profileopposition figures and members of a dissident wing of the CNDD-FDD werearrested in late 2006 and early 2007. State agents or CNDD-FDD démobiliséswere behind the killing of at least three FRODEBU members killed in early2009. The government expelled a group of opposition parliamentarians in June2008, and at the same time, began carrying out mass arrests of opposition partymembers, most of them local party representatives in rural communes.Other incidents could not be definitely traced to governmentor CNDD-FDD officials, but appeared intended to have a chilling effect on thepolitical opposition. For example, unidentified assailants threw grenades atopposition parliamentarians’ homes in August 2007 and March 2008, andFRODEBU members were killed by unidentified assailants in February 2008 andJanuary 2009.Abuse of the JudicialSystem against OpponentsThe abuses documented between 2007 and 2009 followed twohigh-profile cases in which the government attempted to use the judicial systemto silence opponents. While these events took place several years ago, theywere a significant prequel to more recent arrests, indicating a dangerousreadiness to resort to abusive practices for political ends.In August 2006 officials arrested former President DomitienNdayizeye, a prominent member of FRODEBU, former Vice-President Alphonse-MarieKadege of UPRONA, and five other opposition figures and charged them withplotting a coup. Intelligence agents tortured Kadege in an effort to obtain aconfession. But in January 2007 he, Ndayizeye, and three others were acquittedby the Supreme Court. Kadege then fled the country. The court convicted twoother men, Alain Mugabarabona and Tharcisse Ndayishimiye, ignoring their claimthat they had been coerced into making the confessions that constituted thestrongest evidence against them. Three of the acquitted filed claims of tortureagainst state agents. Despite the existence of a video showing the torture, noone was charged.[174]In the second prominent case, a power struggle withinCNDD-FDD came to a head in early 2007 when supporters of President Nkurunzizamoved to strengthen their control within the party by removing CNDD-FDDpresident Hussein Radjabu from his post. Police arrested Radjabu and a group ofhis supporters in April 2007, charging them of “threatening statesecurity.” At his trial before the Supreme Court, one of the accused,Evariste Kagabo, testified that he was tortured by intelligence agents and police.He described the torture in these terms at an appeals hearing:They ordered the police to rub five small sticks between myfingers, I still have scars [from where skin was removed]. Then they orderedthe police to bring a 5-liter bucket [of water]. They tied it to my intimateparts and told me to stand up. It was very painful; I cried out. They toldpolice to bring a rope. They put it in my mouth and pulled to shut me up. Thenthey put a cord around my throat and pulled until I lost consciousness.[175]In April 2008 Radjabu, Kagabo, and five others were foundguilty. Radjabu, Kagabo, and a third defendant were each sentenced to 13 years,and four others to 10 years imprisonment, while one was acquitted.[176]The proceedings failed to meet international fair trial standards; judgesrefusing to hear witnesses the defense believed essential for establishing thefacts and accepted into evidence Kagabo’s confession obtained throughtorture.[177]Although then-chief of staff of the SNR Gervais Ndirakobucaacknowledged to a Human Rights Watch researcher that SNR agents torturedKagabo, no-one has yet been brought to justice.[178]Grenade Attacks onParliamentary Opposition MembersThe crackdown on those who opposed CNDD-FDD’spolicies, including supporters of Radjabu who left the party after his arrest,took a more violent turn in mid-2007. On several occasions, parliamentariansand other politicians who demonstrated open opposition to the ruling party werethen targeted by acts of violence.In August 2007 69 parliamentarians, from both the oppositionand the ruling party, wrote to President Nkurunziza, asking him to meet withthe opposition to discuss disputes over the allocation of government posts. ThePresident did not respond to the request. On August 19 the homes of five of thesignatories were subjected to nearly simultaneous grenade attacks that killedone bystander.[179] The police formed a special commission of judicial policeofficers to investigate the attacks, and in an unusual nod to civil society,included a representative of the human rights organization Ligue Iteka.However, the commission never carried out serious investigations and abandonedits work after its president moved on to another post.[180]In December 2007 a former SNR agentknown as “Bienvenu” confessed in a videotaped interview with ahuman rights organization to having participated in the August attacks.[181]He claimed the SNR had orchestrated the attacks to frighten the opposition intoending the political deadlock.[182]Bienvenu, who was interviewed shortly after he had survived an attempt on hisown life by his own agency, apparently fled Burundi after recording theinterview. His statement led to no new investigations, and noone was ever prosecuted for the attacks.[183]The factional struggle within CNDD-FDD in 2007 caused anumber of members to leave the party. Then, in January 2008, the party expelledAlice Nzomukunda, first vice president of the National Assembly, who had beenoutspoken in her criticism of certain party policies. In response, severalopposition parties boycotted parliament.In late February 2008 46 parliamentarians wrote to UNSecretary General Ban Ki-Moon accusing the ruling party of “persecution,arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial executions, and assassination” of itsopponents.[184]Then, on March 8, grenades were thrown at the homes of Alice Nzomukunda andthree other prominent opposition politicians, Pasteur Mpawenayo, MathiasBasabose, and Zaituni Radjabu, who had abandoned the CNDD-FDD in 2007 andbecome outspoken critics. The former residence of Leonard Nyangoma, presidentof the opposition party CNDD, was also targeted.[185]All of them had signed the letter.[186]The government denied any involvement in the attacks,[187]and police quickly arrested three young men, at least two of whom were or hadbeen JPH members. They were detained beyond the 14-day legal limit forpre-charge detention and were handcuffed for several days and nights.[188]One detainee, SH, said he was beaten with an iron cable and forced to walk onhis knees until they bled.[189]A police officer denied these claims but said he had forced the man to squatthroughout the interrogation.[190]Family members who brought the young men food were held and interrogated foreight hours.[191]In October the three men were provisionally released due to lack of evidence.[192]Another suspect, also a JPH member, was arrested in late November and was inpre-trial detention at the time of this writing.[193]Other Attacks and Threats against PoliticalOpponentsThis was not the only violence or intimidation againstpolitical opponents of the ruling CNDD-FDD. In February 2008 Juma Hakizimana, aFRODEBU member, was arrested by GMIR police as he left FRODEBU’sheadquarters in Bujumbura. He was taken to a GMIR camp in the Buyenzineighborhood of Bujumbura, where he was beaten for three hours and interrogatedabout party activities before being freed.[194]Other incidents could not clearly be linked to state agentsor CNDD-FDD members, though victims themselves as well as third parties oftensuspected them. During the political paralysis that characterized the firstmonths of 2008, a grenade attack on February 3 killed Jean Berchmas Nurwaha, aKanyosha communal council member and FRODEBU member. The killers were neveridentified, though a local official, a CNDD-FDD member, said he himselfbelieved they were démobilisés from CNDD-FDD.[195]At least three FRODEBU members and an MSD member in Bujumbura received death threats in February and early March, causing some to flee theirhomes. The MSD member, OB, said he traced a death threat received by textmessage to a local CNDD-FDD activist. [196]In January 2009 FRODEBU began a campaign to recruitdemobilized FDD combatants into their party. Days after a mass recruitmentceremony in Kamenge commune, on January 26, one of the new recruits, a démobilisénamed Frédéric Misago who had previously worked for the SNR,was shot dead by two unidentified young men outside his home.[197]On February 19 two other démobilisés who had recently leftCNDD-FDD to join FRODEBU were killed in Kinama.[198]A journalist told Human Rights Watch he had information that other démobilisésstill loyal to CNDD-FDD were involved.[199] No one has beenarrested in any of these killings.On April 2, 2009, Emmanuel Minyurano, a chef de quartier(local administrative official) in Kamenge, was shot and killed while walkinghome from a neighborhood bar. Witnesses in Kamenge, including MB, a witnessdetained for questioning, identified the perpetrator as an SNR agent. Policewere aware of the suspected perpetrator’s identity, but he had not yet beenarrested as of this writing.[200]Expulsion of Opposition ParliamentariansIn June 2008 after parliament had been paralyzed for nearlya year due to regular boycotts by opposition members protesting the allocationof government and parliamentary posts, the CNDD-FDD sought to regain control byexcluding from Parliament 22 assembly members who had been elected when theyhad been CNDD-FDD members, but who had since left the party. Most of them wereclose to former party leader Hussein Radjabu. In a decision much criticized byjurists, politicians, members of civil society, and the Geneva-basedInter-Parliamentary Union as unconstitutional, the Constitutional Courtpermitted the exclusion.Furthermore, the assembly president, a CNDD-FDD loyalist,allowed parliamentarians who had left opposition parties to ally with CNDD-FDDto retain their seats, and refused to submit their similar case to the court.CNDD-FDD spokesperson Onésime Nduwimana acknowledged in an interviewwith Human Rights Watch that the move was “political” and may haveinvolved “manipulation” of the Court.[201]While parliament was again able to function, the move further embittered thepolitical atmosphere.[202]Mass Arrests of Political OpponentsBetween June and April 2009, police and local authorities inseveral parts of the country arrested at least 120 individuals associated withopposition parties and claimed they had committed a variety of offences,including “threatening state security”; participating in illegalmeetings[203];insulting the President; and insulting a magistrate.[204]Hitherto such arrests had usually been limited to party officials working atthe national level in Bujumbura.[205]Members of UPD-Zigamibanga[206],MSD, and FRODEBU were among those arrested, as well as former CNDD-FDD membersaffiliated with the faction of Hussein Radjabu. At times, police who carriedout the arrests appeared to be following orders coming from politicians ratherfrom within their formal chain of command.[207] Communaladministrators and governors also used the police to carry outpolitically-motivated arrests; while such officials can legally call onjudicial police officers to arrest suspects, proper procedure was frequentlybypassed.[208]Such politically-motivated arrests violate the freedom of association,guaranteed by the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.[209]Some of those arrested were held for weeks or months onpolitical charges. For example, in Kayanza province, Anaias Havyarimana andHonoré Misago, both UPD members and teachers accused of insulting thePresident after they were overheard criticizing his education policy in aprivate conversation, were remanded in custody after their arrest in September2008 until their acquittal in December.[210]Others were held without charge and released after severaldays. For example, Apollinaire Nyandwi was arrested in Ngozi province inOctober because he was in possession of a UPD brochure. Vincent Niyondiku, a74-year-old man, was arrested in Karusi province in November because he hadagreed to let FRODEBU plant a party flag on his property.[211]Police and local government officials also shut downmeetings and press conferences held by opposition parties throughout 2008,without specific reasons to do so, again in violation of the right to freedomof association.[212]In Kayanza province, the administrator of Matongo commune wrote to FRODEBUstating, “[the Governor] has informed us that all FRODEBU meetings of anynature are forbidden,” with no further explanation.[213]Other parties, including UPRONA, CNDD-Nyangoma, and the Democratic Alliance forRenewal (ADR), faced similar prohibitions.[214]When opposition parties complained about discriminatorytreatment, the then-Minister of Interior, Venant Kamana, responded with furtherrestrictions. On October 6, 2008, he signed an ordinance that required allpolitical parties to ask permission to hold meetings and gave local officialsthe power to prohibit them. The ordinance also stated that local administrativeofficials—most of whom belong to CNDD-FDD—could attend the meetingsor send police to “ensure the security of people and goods as well asgood morals.”[215]Even when parties complied with the new ordinance, theyfaced repression. On October 8, 2008, the ADR organized a press conference in Bujumbura, with authorization from the city government. Nevertheless, it was closed down bythe police. Party activists contacted Minister Kamana by mobile phone to urgehim to explain to the police that they had authorization. Kamana agreed, butpolice refused to take the call. They told ADR they were acting on “otherorders.”[216]In mid-November, Kamana held a meeting with politicalparties to hear their complaints, which they had raised in letters to him andaired through the media. He subsequently revoked the ordinance requiringparties to request authorization to hold meetings, reverting to the previoussystem under which parties are required to inform local authorities.[217]A representative of CNDD-Nyangoma told Human Rights Watch that harassmentdecreased after this change.[218]However, in January 2009, Kamana was removed from his post and replaced by Edouard Nduwimana, the former Governor of Kayanza, who has previously been cited by severalpolitical parties for taking repressive measures against them.[219]Reports of opposition party meetings being shut down illegally and of thearbitrary arrest of party activists have continued.[220]Arrest of MSD President Alexis SinduhijeOn November 3, 2008, police arrested Alexis Sinduhije, thefounder of the opposition Movement for Solidarity and Democracy (MSD) (formerly“Movement for Security and Democracy”), and 37 others during a raidon the party’s headquarters, accusing them of “threatening statesecurity.” The police search of the premises was illegal because thesearch warrant was for a different place altogether and referred to a judicialfile that did not yet exist.[221]Sinduhije was an internationally-known journalist before he established the MSDand announced his intention to run for the presidency. Since December 2007 hisefforts to register the MSD as a political party had been refused on variouscounts (for example, that the proposed party name could not include the word“security,” as security was the exclusive domain of the state).[222]The 37 people detained with Sinduhije were all released byNovember 10 without charge. For several days Sinduhije was denied visits by hislawyers, family members, human rights observers, and foreign diplomats closelyfollowing the case.[223]Unable to find evidence that Sinduhije had threatened state security, onNovember 11 prosecutors charged him with “insulting the President,”a crime in Burundian law. In a November 28 hearing, the Prosecutor explainedthat the charge was based on a document in Sinduhije’s possession whichstated: “the responsibility for the corruption scandals and theassassinations ordered by the party CNDD-FDD lie with the man who passes histime in prayer meetings.” The Prosecutor said the phrase referred to andinsulted President Nkurunziza, a born-again Christian.[224]On February 19, 2009, Sinduhije’s trial opened and he was acquitted onMarch 12. As of late April, however, the Minister of the Interior continued torefuse to register MSD as a political party.Sinduhije’s case generated considerable internationalconcern.[225]The fact that he and many of his MSD members, like many members ofUPD-Zigamibanga, were one-time supporters of CNDD-FDD led to concern that thearrests were a form of political vengeance, and a warning to the party faithfulabout what might happen to defectors. According to one observer from thediplomatic community, the ruling party’s message underlying the arrestsof MSD and UPD members was: “No traitors.”[226]VIII. State-Sanctioned Political Intimidation byCNDD-FDD Youth GroupsTowards the end of 2008, CNDD-FDD youth groups in severalparts of the country began to mobilize in quasi-military displays of publicstrength. These displays constitute political intimidation, and the involvementof local officials and the complacent reaction of more senior CNDD-FDDofficials suggest that this is sanctioned by the authorities. Beginning in December 2008, residents of Busoni commune,Kirundo province and Kayogoro commune, Makamba province reported“militia-like” activities by former FDD combatants and members ofthe CNDD-FDD youth league, known as “Imbonerakure.” The youth, withthe acquiescence of local administrative, police, and party officials, carriedout harassment and arrests of political opponents.In Kayogoro, for example, CNDD-FDD youth marched through thestreets in the evening, armed with sticks and clubs, singing military songs; ajournalist who documented these activities said that the song lyrics, inKirundi, included phrases such as “Those who are not with us are going tohave problems.” The journalist also received reports that this groupparticipated in nighttime military training in a field, armed with Kalashnikovsand grenades.[227]A BINUB official reported that a group of at least 12 former FDD combatantsalong with local administrative officials carried out nighttime patrols,arresting over a dozen members of the political opposition, particularly FNLmembers. They detained them in an illegal jail cell nearby.[228]In Busoni commune, Kirundo province, the CNDD-FDD youth leagueengaged in “night-time sports,” which involved parading with largesticks in military fashion.[229]According to media reports, these youth also chanted threatening slogans about“crushing their opponents.” Jean Minani, a prominentparliamentarian from Busoni and founder of “Frodebu-Nyakuri,” asplinter group of FRODEBU that generally aligns with CNDD-FDD, told HumanRights Watch he had observed the activities. He confirmed that the youth werearmed with sticks and clubs, and chanted slogans in Kirundi which roughlytranslated as “Those who are not with us will be sent into exile ordie.” He described the group as “practically a paramilitarygroup,” and said it was used by local officials to threaten politicalopponents and carry out arrests.[230]In both cases the illegal behavior was encouraged ortolerated by government and party officials. The Governor of Makamba dismissedconcerns about groups in Kayogoro, referring to them as “local securitycommittees.”[231]CNDD-FDD spokesperson Onésime Nduwimana explained that local partymembers were attempting to mobilize the community to patrol and find those whowere burning down their headquarters. He said the problem was that the patrolshad become obligatory, with party members compelling others to participate. He recognizedthat the forced patrols were interpreted by others as intimidation, and saidthe police should take over the patrols.[232] In the case ofBusoni, Nduwimana said the youth group’s activities were “simplysports”[233]and were not intended to intimidate the political opposition.[234]The Imbonerakure’s activities in neighboring communesindicated otherwise, according to media and UN reports. In early February inBugabira commune, Kirundo province, youth group members forcibly dispersedmeetings of two political parties, UPRONA and UPD-Zigamibanga.[235]In Butihinda commune, Muyinga province, theImbonerakure beat a pregnantwoman who refused to help them transport material to construct a CNDD-FDDmeeting place.[236]Opposition parties have expressed fear that the Imbonerakureare being trained as a pro-government militia.[237]In February one Busoni resident told the local Burundian newspaper Iwacuthat the groups were engaged in military training at a shooting range known asYanza in Busoni. He said the group had attempted to recruit him, but that hehad refused. CNDD-FDD officials interviewed by Iwacu denied theallegations.[238]The formation of militias is a violation of Burundian law.[239]IX. The Reaction ofAuthoritiesReaction to AbusesAttributed to State Agents and CNDD-FDD MembersAbuses committed by state agents and their proxies havegenerally met with impunity. Police and judicial officials often fail toinvestigate crimes, and when they do, case files are often eventually closedwith no arrests or prosecutions. Government officials have also interfered withjudicial investigations. Human Rights Watch has received consistent reportsthat some police and SNR officials have been complicit in crimes. In responseto reports of abuses by both police officers and démobilisés,police officials have taken some action to limit such abuses, but have notinitiated criminal investigations into the alleged perpetrators.No one has yet been arrested for the 12 murders of allegedFNL and FRODEBU members that Human Rights Watch has documented since January2008 (see Annex 1). The SNR has categorically denied involvement.[240]Even where judicial officials have showed some initiative toinvestigate politically-motivated crimes, action has generally been limited. InJune 2008 prosecutors in Karusi province and Gitega province interrogated thecommunal administrator of Nyabikere commune about his alleged role in the deathof Libère Ntawukirumwansi, but then closed the file, claiming not tohave sufficient evidence to pursue prosecution.[241]More positively, in Makamba province, judicial authorities showed somewillingness to pursue complaints concerning the assault of detainees inKayogoro commune in December 2008. As of this writing, a Makamba prosecutor hasopened investigations into the role of a prominent CNDD-FDD activist in thebeatings, though no arrests have yet been made. On the other hand, in Ngoziprovince, authorities made no effort to pursue those responsible for beatingsuspected FNL members in Nyamurenza in December 2008.Neither the SNR nor the police have been willing toofficially acknowledge collaboration with démobilisés inseveral urban neighborhoods, most notably Kinama, who carried out the beatingsand illegal arrests of alleged FNL members documented in this report(particularly in May and June of 2008). However in June 2008, LK, a policeofficial speaking to Human Rights Watch on condition of anonymity, acknowledgedthat some former combatants in Kinama commune, Bujumbura, were known to makeillegal arrests and to beat their victims before turning them over to thepolice or the SNR. He said a senior official at the SNR, Colonel AgricoleNtirampeba, was in contact with these individuals to coordinate the arrest ofsuspects and their transfer to the SNR, as were several police officers. Whenasked why LK did not himself arrest the former combatants for illegal armspossession and assault, he said that it was out of his hands becausehigh-ranking authorities were involved. “This comes from my superiors andis beyond my power to stop,” he said.[242] ColonelNtirampeba himself denied having any contact with démobilisés inKinama.[243]After incidents involving the démobilisés inKinama were raised repeatedly by human rights observers, the police carried outone search at the home of the group, but they only seized weapons and did notmade any arrests.[244]The detachment that actually conducted the search was composed of GMIR policefrom Camp Socarti, among those known to collaborate closely with the démobiliségroup.[245]The number of human rights violations committed by the SNRappeared to reduce in the second half of 2008, though SNR agents played a rolein some arrests of opposition members. However, other police violations of therights of both alleged FNL members and opposition members continued to occur.Police sometimes appeared to act on their own initiative, but sometimescommitted abuses at the behest of administrative authorities, as in Nyabikere,where FNL members said police beat them on the orders of the Governor of Karusi.As of this writing, at least two police officials with along record of abuses–Fidèle Nsengiyumva, the former ProvincialCommissioner of Mwaro, and Désiré Uwamahoro, the former commanderof Camp Socarti in Bujumbura—had been removed from their posts andredeployed at headquarters, apparently in response to pressure from humanrights groups.[246]But they did not receive disciplinary sanctions. Uwamahoro and two other policeofficers, officially charged by the Muramvya prosecutor in November 2007 oftorturing and beating detainees, have not yet been tried. No investigationstook place into the August 2008 police killing of FNL member Daneck Koriciza.Although the military has rarely been implicated in abusesof a political nature, soldiers implicated in the arrest and beatings ofalleged FNL members in Isale and Bujumbura in May 2008 have not been identifiedor charged.Police and judicial authorities, as well as CNDD-FDDofficials, have been generally unwilling to acknowledge that the arrest ofopposition members and other attempts to silence dissent are politicallymotivated. Police usually argue that arrests are legally correct and justified.For instance, they have argued that various opposition parties’activities–ranging from holding meetings to passing around articlespublished by opposition figures–are of a seditious nature (see Annex 2).[247]In one exception, CNDD-FDD spokesperson Onésime Nduwimana acknowledgedthat the expulsion of the 22 opposition parliamentarians was a politicalchoice.[248]Furthermore, government officials have actively interferedwith the independence of the judicial system. BINUB reported that an assistantprosecutor in Kayanza province freed a number of alleged FNL members inNovember 2008 after finding no evidence that they had committed any crime. Theassistant prosecutor was subsequently threatened by then-Governor of Kayanza Edouard Nduwimana, a CNDD-FDD member, and fled the province.[249]Rather than taking clear steps to address human rightsviolations, in general government officials and CNDD-FDD members play down thethreat that abuses such as those documented in this report might pose for theelectoral process in 2010. For example, CNDD-FDD spokesperson Nduwimana reactedangrily to an International Crisis Group report published in August 2008forewarning possible election violence; he told Human Rights Watch, “Therisk is overstated.... Elections have always been peaceful in Burundi.”[250]In Ngozi, where CNDD-FDD representative Anthère Ntarundenga was killedin January 2009, the governor’s senior advisor (a CNDD-FDD member) toldHuman Rights Watch, “I don’t anticipate problems in the elections.No political party encourages violence; people don’t want to kill eachother for political causes anymore.”[251] In fact, whilevoting itself proceeded smoothly in both elections in recent Burundianhistory—in 1993  and 2005—killings and acts of intimidation byarmed partisans of various parties marked the 2005 election campaign, as wellas the post-election period in both cases.[252]In November 2008 Burundi’s National Assembly passed anew criminal code which criminalizes torture, improving the opportunity forvictims of abuse to secure redress. This positive development was somewhatwatered down, however, by the failure to incorporate a provision that existedin the previous criminal code penalizing public officials who knowinglyparticipated in illegal deprivation of liberty. However, senators responded toconcern at the loss of this provision,[253] and on February17, 2009, passed a revised version of the code that reincorporates it. HumanRights Watch is not aware, however, of any case in which the law has led toprosecutions.Reaction to AbusesCommitted By FNL Members and DissidentsThe government has adopted a contradictory stance withregard to abuses committed by the FNL. Despite the high number of arbitraryarrests of alleged FNL sympathizers, FNL members have rarely been arrested foractual crimes, leaving some victims with the sense that police are afraid toextend the rule of law to the movement.[254]Police officials said their lack of capacity to pursuemembers of an armed group has prevented them from bringing crimes to justice.One police official complained in April 2008 that despite compelling evidencelinking the FNL to killings, “We couldn’t arrest the perpetrators.It’s an armed movement that we can’t penetrate.”[255]Even in March 2009 as the FNL began its transformation into a political partyand prepared to disarm, police found it too dangerous to enter the FNL camp inRukoko in order to arrest suspects.[256]Confusion around the immunity accorded to the FNL has alsocontributed to impunity. For example, some Burundians appear to believe thatthe FNL has immunity from prosecution for all crimes. In one example tolddirectly to Human Rights Watch, FS, a witness to the killing by the FNL ofFreddy Nkunzwenimana, the police informant shot in March 2008, said there wasno point in filing a complaint because the FNL had “provisionalimmunity.”[257]In fact, as described above, immunity only applies to crimes related to thearmed conflict and committed before the ceasefire in September 2006.[258]Some police seemed to share this misperception.[259]The FNL, for its part, has defended some crimes and refusedto accept responsibility for others. The crimes they have claimed are those ofa political nature, such as the attacks on dissidents at Buterere, Rugazi, andKabezi. The FNL leadership has not acknowledged any contradiction between itswillingness to suppress dissent through force and its intention to participatein democratic elections in 2010.[260]After returning to negotiations, FNL representatives to thepeace process expressed willingness to turn over members suspected ofcommitting crimes, as in Nyamurenza commune in January 2009. Agathon Rwasa,speaking in a debate organized by Radio Isanganiro in August, said,“Palipehutu-FNL members who commit crimes should be brought tojustice.”[261]However, no members suspected of the crimes documented in this report,including those who killed JPH member Abraham Ngendakumana in February 2009,had been turned over at the time of this writing.The alleged FNL dissidents, though they initially seemed tohave a free rein to loot from surrounding populations[262],came under greater scrutiny as accusations against them mounted. Beginning inFebruary 2008, officials have reported the arrest of dozens of FNL dissidentsin Bubanza province for crimes including murder, rape, and theft. Bubanzajudicial officials did not keep records on the number of dissidents chargedwith or convicted of crimes, but unlike the state agents, government proxies,and mainstream FNL combatants who committed crimes documented in this report,the dissidents did not appear to benefit from impunity.X. Role of InternationalStakeholdersBoth the UN Security Council (in its resolutions) and BINUBhave repeatedly pushed for a definitive peace agreement, suggesting it shouldbe the government’s foremost priority.[263] While such apeace agreement will almost certainly carry important human rights dividends,international attention on the peace process has at times not been matched byconcern about human rights abuses, including killings and arrests seen as too“minor” to affect its outcome. Focus on the peace process shouldnot detract from attention to ongoing abuses against local level politicalactivists, including FNL and CNDD-FDD members, and the problem of impunity thatfacilitates such abuses.The FNL’s return to combat in April 2008 was widelycriticized and subsequent steps forward in the peace process have been widelylauded by the UN and foreign governments. However, there have been few publicreactions to killings and other acts of violence pitting CNDD–FDDsupporters against FNL supporters in Kinama, Kamenge, Nyabikere, Nyamurenzi,and Kayogoro.[264]FNL violence against their own members has also often gone unnoted, includingthe killing of Abraham Ngendakumana in February 2009 in the midst ofnegotiations.South Africa has played a key role in the peace process,providing both negotiators and peacekeeping troops under the aegis of theAfrican Union (AU). Following the abduction of JPH member Jean BaptisteNsabimana in January 2009 by FNL fighters in a Joint Verification andMonitoring Mechanism (JVMM) vehicle, in the company of a South African peacekeeper,the AU issued clear instructions to peacekeepers to avoid any complicity in FNLcrimes.[265]The incident was deeply embarrassing for the AU, but AU Ambassador MamadouBâ refused to accept any AU responsibility for allowing the abduction totake place. He said the peacekeeper had not been disciplined, as “wedon’t sanction people the first time.”  The ambassador toldHuman Rights Watch it was difficult to track the use of JVMM vehicles, and thatin any case, “Problems of FNL versus FNL are not our business.”[266]In September 2008 Human Rights Watch raised concerns aboutthe lack of attention to political violence in rural areas to a senior diplomatin Bujumbura, suggesting such violence might increase in the lead-up toelections if met with impunity. He responded frankly: “The diplomatsdon’t care about what happens in the interior of the country.”[267]However, in January 2009, several diplomatic missions raised concerns withBurundian officials about the militia-like activities of CNDD-FDD Youth Leaguemembers in Kirundo and Makamba provinces, a promising development afterprevious inattention.[268]In monthly meetings on human rights organized by OHCHR,members of the diplomatic community in Bujumbura have long expressed concernabout the problem of impunity for past crimes, but have failed to takeconcerted action. In February 2008, responding to the surge of killings in Bujumbura, several members of the diplomatic community present at one such meetingproposed a joint letter from BINUB, the African Union, and the European Unionto President Nkurunziza expressing concern that impunity for past crimes wascontributing to current violence. Though others present at the meetingexpressed support, they proceeded to back out one by one. Over a year later, nosuch letter had been delivered, though impunity remained a problem.[269]The response of foreign diplomats to political repression ofopposition groups has also been varied. Some even welcomed the expulsion of 22opposition parliamentarians in June 2008, seeing it as an opportunity to getParliament working again, despite the illegality of the move, and few havereacted to the July 2008 arrests of two of those parliamentarians, PasteurMpawenayo and Gérard Nkurunziza, on questionable charges.[270]The November 2008 arrest of Alexis Sinduhije, who had traveled widely inAfrica, Europe, and the United States, caught the attention of diplomats. The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union responded quickly with statements condemning thearrests as politically motivated and in violation of the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights.[271]However, they have paid little attention to the arrests of minor oppositionparty activists in the interior.Human rights officers working under the joint aegis of BINUBand OHCHR have often been assiduous in reporting on and advocating locally foran end to abuses, but BINUB has not often made use of their wealth ofinformation to publicly denounce abuses.[272] BINUB did notsign on to the joint letter on impunity, discussed above. A report on freedomof expression, drafted by human rights officers in 2008, has not yet beenpublished due to disagreements over the timing of the report and thepolitically sensitive nature of some material within.[273]UN human rights officers have organized weekly meetingsattended by representatives of the police, the army, the SNR, the office of theProsecutor, Burundian human rights NGOs, and Human Rights Watch to discuss someof the abuses documented in the report. These meetings were instrumental inaddressing police, SNR, and FDN misconduct vis-à-vis Palipehutu-FNL andopposition parties, at times leading to the liberation of those detainedarbitrarily.The UN Independent Expert on the Situation of Human Rightsin Burundi, Akich Okola, highlighted concerns that unresolved politicaltensions could dissolve into widespread election related violence at a meetingof the diplomatic community on January 28, 2009. Diplomatic missions intend tosend delegations of election observers to monitor the situation in the monthsleading up to the elections as well as during elections themselves.[274]A UN official expressed concern to Human Rights Watch that as of this writing,the UN had not yet been invited to assist in organizing the elections.[275]The UN and donors, most notably the UK Department forInternational Development (DFID), have dedicated substantial resources to Burundi’s judicial system. While new courthouses were built and judicial personnelattended human rights trainings, the lack of independence of the judiciary, andongoing impunity for human rights abuses, remained as obstacles to the deliveryof justice in most of the cases documented in this report.Donors also contributed to more questionable institutions.The Peacebuilding Fund, a fund established by bilateral donors to support theobjectives of the UN Peacebuilding Commission and administered in Burundi by aSteering Committee composed of donors, Burundian officials, and BINUBrepresentatives, agreed in late 2007 to provide US$500,000 to the intelligenceservice (SNR), in spite of extrajudicial executions and torture attributed tothat agency. Some members of the steering committee pushed for funds to belinked to accountability for past abuses, but the majority refused, allowingcontinued impunity for the serious human rights violations attributed to theSNR between 2005 and 2007.[276]International actors should already turn their attentiontowards ensuring the 2010 elections meet regional and international standardsallowing the people of Burundi to freely exercise their civil and politicalrights and to vote for the candidates of their choice.  Impunity and lackof judicial independence are underlying concerns which need addressing toprevent human rights abuses during the pre-election period. In addition,national and international observers should be operational well before theofficial election period so that issues such as politically-motivated arrests,election-related violence, irregularities in voter registration, and media biascan be raised and dealt with prior to voting.  Donors should ensure thatthe Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) plays a proactive role ininvestigating such irregularities in a timely manner, referring cases to thejudiciary where necessary.Annex 1: Politically-Motivated Killings/Attacks byFirearm or Grenade, January 2008-April 2009[277][278]KillingsDateVictimVictim’sAffiliationCommune,ProvinceCommentsApril2, 2009EmmanuelMinyuranoLocalFRODEBU official (chef de Quartier Mirango) and FNL memberKamenge,BujumburaShotby SNR agentMarch26, 2009Antoine BaransekeraCNDD-FDDmemberIsale,Bujumbura RuraleShotby FNL combatants; several are detained; a former FRODEBU official, wanted inconnection with the case, is in hidingFebruary19, 2009FaridaFRODEBU; former CNDD-FDD combatantsKinama,BujumburaShotby other démobilisés after leaving CNDD-FDD to join FRODEBUFebruary19, 2009Man (Alida’s husband)January26, 2009FrédéricMisago aka “Mwarabu”FRODEBU;former CNDD-FDD member and SNR agentKamenge,BujumburaShotafter leaving CNDD-FDD to join FRODEBU, and recruiting other ex-combatants todo the sameJanuary7, 2009AnthèreNtarundengaCommunalCNDD-FDD vice-presidentNyamurenza,NgoziKilledshortly after he beat FNL members; two suspects, FNL members, are currentlyin prison awaiting trialNovember4, 2008AlphonseShikamiroCNDD-FDDmemberRugazi,BubanzaKidnappedby FNL members; presumed deadAugust24, 2008DaneckKoricizaFNLcombatantKinama,BujumburaWaswanted in connection with attacks on CNDD-FDD members; shot by policeApril24, 2008Jean-MarieFumbuCNDD-FDDmemberGihosha,BujumburaKilledin grenade attack by FNL combatantsApril9, 2008SylvestreNikoyandemye aka “Gaforode”Local UPRONA official (chef de colline)Bugabira,KirundoKilledshortly after a political argument with a police chiefMarch28, 2008FreddyNkunzwenimanaCNDD-FDDmember, police informantKinama,BujumburaKilledby FNL membersMarch8, 2008LibèreNtawukirumwansiFNLmemberNyabikere,KarusiTheprosecutors’ office opened an investigation and interrogated theCommunal Administrator, but subsequently closed the fileFebruary2008LocalofficialCNDD-FDDMpanda,BubanzaFebruary3, 2008JeanBerchmas NurwahaLocalFRODEBU official (communal council member)Kanyosha,BujumburaKilledby grenades; local officials suspect CNDD-FDD ex-combatantsJanuary31, 2008Raphaël MisagoLocal CNDD-FDD official (chef de zone Mutambu)Mutambu,Bujumbura RuraleWitnessescited FNL combatants as perpetratorsJanuary23, 2008LocalofficialCNDD-FDD(chef de colline Buringa)Gihanga,BubanzaLocal officials suspect FNLJanuary2008Cyprien PimapimaLocal CNDD-FDD official (chef de zone Buringa)Gihanga, BubanzaLocal officials suspect FNLJanuary22, 2008TimothéNgendabankaRelativesof  FNL memberKamenge,BujumburaAwitness told HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH that an SNR agent carried out the killing andthat police did not do investigationsJanuary22, 2008FredianeNikonkuruJanuary20, 2008Emmanuel Minani, aka“Papa Lolo”FNLmemberKinama,BujumburaAlthougha witness gave a radio interview citing by name a member of the PresidentialGuard involved in the killing, he was never interrogated, and no one wasarrestedJanuary20, 2008JospinNzeyimana (son of Papa Lolo)Relativeof FNL memberJanuary18, 2008Jean Baptiste Ntirabampa, aka “Makanaki”Local CNDD-FDD official (chef de Quartier Teza)Kamenge,BujumburaThevictims had received threats from FNL combatants before his deathJanuary2, 2008Emmanuel,aka “Papillon”FNLmemberKanyosha,BujumburaWitnessescited SNR involvementNon-fatal Attacks by Firearm or GrenadeDateName of VictimVictim’s AffiliationCommune,ProvinceCommentsJanuary18, 2009NestorNtakirutimanaLocalCNDD-FDD official (Kayogoro Communal Administrator)Kayogoro,MakambaGrenadethrown at houseJanuary14, 2009AntoineCizaLocalCNDD-FDD official (Nyabikere Communal Administrator)Nyabikere,KarusiGrenadethrown at house; occupants seriously injured; six FNL members arrested andbeaten, currently awaiting trialJanuary14, 2009BienvenuMugishaFNLcombatantNyabikere,KarusiGrenadethrown at houseJanuary13, 2009DavidFNLcombatantNyabikere,KarusiGrenadesthrown at houses after Governor, in public meeting, called for“castrating” FNL membersJanuary13, 2009DonatienFNLcombatantDecember29, 2008MathiasNijimbereCNDDmemberRumonge,BururiGrenadethrown at house; attackers shouted “chien de Nyangoma”(Nyangoma’s dog), referencing the CNDD PresidentJune2008Family“chez Minani”Relativesof FNL memberKinama,BujumburaGrenadeattack; several people injuredMarch29, 2008Familyof “Janvier”Relativesof FNL memberKinama,BujumburaGrenadesthrown at house after rumors circulated that Janvier was involved in killingFreddy NkunzwenimanaMarch8, 2008AliceNzomukundaFormerCNDD-FDD parliamentarianRohero,BujumburaNear-simultaneousgrenade attacks on houses.

According to the law, “armed bands” are thosewho seek to “trouble the state” by attempting to destroy or changethe constitutional regime, mobilize citizens to take up arms against the state,attack the national territory, or organize massacres.

The Parties also agree to cease “any action likely to impede thenormal implementation of the peace process” (Article 2, 1.1.7).

This is also not the first time the FNL has allegedlysplit between those who do and do not support the peace process. In October2005 a similar series of events led to a breakaway faction of the FNL under theleadership of Jean Claude Sindayigaya. Similar allegations ofSindayigaya’s relationship with the government were made and this factionnever materialized substantially or engaged in successful talks with thegovernment. See Human Rights Watch, Missteps at a Crucial Moment.[143]Dissidentswere disarmed, but not demobilized until April 2009.

From early September, the number of dissidents grew from several hundredto several thousand. Habimana was not alone in asserting that the increaseresulted from government action, but as government and military officialsstated, it was also due to spontaneous gatherings of civilians hoping to passas combatants in order to share in the expected benefits of a demobilizationprogram.
