Former detainees say that police often strap them into these metal chairs for hours and even days, depriving detainees of sleep, and immobilizing them until their legs and buttocks were swollen.© 2014 PrivateSummaryIn May 2010, Chinese media went into a frenzy over the caseof Zhao Zuohai, a 57-year-old man who in 1999 had been convicted of murdering aneighbor. On April 30, 2010, the neighbor reappeared in their village,apparently having merely fled after a violent dispute with Zhao. Zhao, who saidpolice torture in 1999 had led him to confess to a murder he did not commit,was released after 11 years in prison. The Zhao case is one of a number ofcases of police brutality that have emerged fromacross China around 2009 and 2010, prompting a national outcry against such abuse.The Chinese government adoptedlegal prohibitions on the mistreatment of persons in custody as early as 1979, ratified the United NationsConvention against Torture in 1988, and launched official campaigns to curbtorture in the 1990s. Yet at the time of the 2009 and 2010 outcry, the use oftorture and forced confessions had long been endemic to China’s criminaljustice system. Even Chinese officials had characterized torture in detentionas “common,” “serious,” and “nationwide.”It has received attention at the United Nations, by Chinese legal scholars, andin reports of Chinese and international nongovernmental organizations.Following the 2009 cases, the government announced variousmeasures to curb torture as well as convictions based on evidence wrongfullyobtained. The measures included legislative and regulatory reforms, such asprohibitions on using detainee “cell bosses” to manage otherdetainees, and practical steps such as erecting physical barriers to separatepolice from criminal suspects and videotaping some interrogations.In 2012, the National People’s Congress revised thecountry’s Criminal Procedure Law to require law enforcement officials toimprove access to legal counsel for suspects and to exclude suspects’confessions and written statements obtained through torture. The Ministry ofPublic Security, the agency in charge of the police, claims that the use ofcoerced confessions decreased 87 percent in 2012, that cell bosses who abusefellow suspects are “things of the past,” and that deaths incustody reached a “historic low” in 2013. Some Chinese legalscholars contend that, due to these efforts, torture is “gradually beingcurbed” at least for ordinary, non-political criminal defendants.This report— based on Human Rights Watch analysis ofhundreds of newly published court verdicts from across the country andinterviews with 48 recent detainees, family members, lawyers, and formerofficials—shows that the measures adopted between 2009 and 2013 have notgone far enough.The detainees and defense lawyers we spoke with said that somepolice officers deliberately thwart the new protections by taking detaineesfrom official detention facilities or use torture methods that leave no visibleinjuries. In other cases, procurators and judges ignore clear evidence ofmistreatment, rendering China’s new “exclusionary rule”—whichprohibits the use of evidence directly obtained through torture—of nohelp. Out of 432 court verdicts from early 2014 examined by Human Rights Watchin which suspects alleged torture, only 23 resulted in evidence being thrownout by the court; none led to acquittal of the defendant.While measures such as the exclusionary rule and videotapedinterrogations are positive, they are being grafted onto a criminal justicesystem that still affords the police enormous power over the judiciary andoffers police numerous opportunities to abuse suspects. For example, the Ministryof Public Security operates the detention centers, not the Ministry of Justice,permitting police unlimited and unsupervised access to detainees. Lawyerscannot be present during interrogations and suspects have no right to remainsilent, violating their right against self-incrimination. Procurators andjudges rarely question or challenge police conduct, and internal oversightmechanisms remain weak. According to academic sources, only a minority ofcriminal suspects have defense lawyers.Absent more fundamental reforms in the Chinese criminaljustice system that empower defense lawyers, the judiciary, and independentmonitors, the elimination of routine torture and ill-treatment is unlikely.In 2014, the reversal of two verdicts by appeals courtsbrought positive outcomes, but more than anything the reversals demonstratedthe entrenched failings of the existing system. In a landmark case, a courtacquitted Nian Bin who spent eight years on death row for the murder of twochildren based on his confession obtained through torture. In another case, acourt in Inner Mongolia issued a posthumous exoneration of Huugjilt, an ethnicMongolian teenager executed in 1996 for rape and murder also based on aconfession obtained through torture. In both cases, the internal mechanismsresponsible for police oversight—police internal supervision units, theprocuratorate, and the courts—missed or ignored the use of torture toobtain convictions.If China’s leadership is genuinely committed to legalreform and to addressing growing public frustration over miscarriages ofjustice, it should move swiftly to ensure that lawyers are present duringpolice interrogations, adopt legislation guaranteeing suspects’ right to remainsilent, and establish an independent commission to receive and investigate complaintsof police abuse. It should also go beyond measures adopted since 2009, whichwere modifications to a fundamentally abusive system, and instead make systemicchanges that strengthen the procuratorate and the judiciary relative to thepolice. Such reforms should include transferring responsibility for detentionfacilities to the Ministry of Justice, which currently oversees prisons, and freeingthe judiciary from Party control. Allowing a visit by the UN special rapporteuron torture would be a serious indication of commitment to reform.China’s November 2015 review before the UN Committeeagainst Torture affords the Chinese government an important opportunity todemonstrate its commitment to vigorously implementing existing laws, and tomaking key improvements to eradicate torture and ill-treatment of detainees. Failureto do so will raise larger questions about the government’s willingnessto bring reforms to improve public confidence in the country’s judicialsystem.***A central component of theresearch for this report was our search of a large database of Chinese courtverdicts—made possible by a Supreme People’s Court (SPC) decisionrequiring all courts to post decisions online starting January 1, 2014—andour analysis of the resulting subset of verdicts in which suspects allegedpolice torture. We searched all of the roughly 158,000 verdicts published onthe SPC website between January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2014. As noted above, atotal of 432 verdicts referenced torture allegations and judges excludedconfessions in only 23 cases.Further analysis of the 432 verdicts shows that very fewjudges investigated torture allegations in any detail. Thirty-two verdictsmention suspects’ alleged torture and then say nothing further about it. Inthe remaining 400 verdicts, judges addressed the torture claims, but most oftenrelied solely on documentary evidence (247 of the 400) or on the existing caserecord with no additional evidentiary sources (118 of the 400). In only 35verdicts is there any mention of live witness testimony and in every instancethose witnesses were police officers; there is no sign that defense witnessesor medical or forensic experts were allowed to testify in relation to a tortureclaim.Our analysis of court cases and interviews with formerdetainees show that police torture and ill-treatment of suspects in pre-trialdetention remains a serious concern. Former detainees described physical andpsychological torture during police interrogations, including being hung by thewrists, being beaten with police batons or other objects, and prolonged sleepdeprivation.Some said they were restrained for days in so-called“tiger chairs” (used to immobilize suspects during interrogations),handcuffs, or leg irons; one convicted prisoner awaiting review of his deathsentence had been handcuffed and shackled for eight years. Some detainees spokeabout abuses at the hands of “cell bosses,” fellow detainees usedby detention center police as de facto managers of each multi-person cell. Insome cases, the abuse resulted in death or permanent physical or mentaldisabilities. Most suspects who complained of torture to the authorities hadbeen accused of common crimes such as theft. Interviewees said torture isparticularly severe in major cases with multiple suspects, such as in organizedor triad-related crimes.In most of the cases we examined, police used torture and otherill-treatment to elicit confessions on which convictions could be secured. Abuseswere facilitated by suspects’ lack of access to lawyers, family members, anddoctors not beholden to the police.Former detainees and relatives described the difficulty ofretaining lawyers willing to challenge the police in court over allegations ofmistreatment. In addition, many told Human Rights Watch that medical personnelwho have the opportunity to report apparent torture or ill-treatment do not doso, denying detainees a critical source to validate their allegations.Videotaped interrogations are routinely manipulated, such as by first torturingthe suspects and then taping the confession, further weakening suspects’claims of ill-treatment. Police use of torture outside detention centers means thatdetainees often live in terror of being taken from the centers, whether forpurported transfers to another facility or for any other reason.As noted above, the exclusionary rule, one of the mostimportant protections established to protect detainees from torture, has alsoproved to be of limited utility thus far. Lawyers told Human Rights Watch theywelcome the rule insofar as it provides an opportunity to challenge policebehavior in legal proceedings. However, in practice procurators and judges toooften ignore their requests, often providing no reason for doing so, or givethem only perfunctory consideration without seeking evidence to corroboratedetainees’ torture claims.Judges often evaluate torture claims solely on the basis ofdocumentary evidence that is either produced or controlled by the police and,unlike with live witnesses, is not subject to cross-examination. In the courtverdicts Human Rights Watch analyzed, not a single defense witness or expert witnesstestified regarding the torture claims. Although the exclusionary rule placesthe burden of proof on the procuratorate to demonstrate that the policeobtained evidence legally, judges often continue to expect detainees to provethat torture had taken place.The extraordinary power of the police is reflected in the pervasivelack of accountability for police abuse, recent reforms notwithstanding. Those whomHuman Rights Watch interviewed—including a former judge and a formerpolice officer—agreed that mechanisms to supervise the police areinadequate, and that police officers are rarely held legally accountable forabuse. Among the SPC verdict database cases we found only one prosecution of threepolice officers responsible for torture, but none served jail time. The lack of prosecutions in turn means thatcompensation or rehabilitation for victims is especially difficult to obtain. Formerdetainees who had tried to press claims for compensation said that police atmost offered them some money in exchange for their silence, and that it is verydifficult to access formal state compensation. Detainees’ efforts to seekaccountability have produced few positive results and in some cases have evenled to further punishment.Finally, while this report focuses on the mistreatment ofordinary criminal suspects in custody, the torture and ill-treatment of thosedetained for political reasons remains a severe problem. Political prisonerssuch as Gao Zhisheng, Guo Feixiong, Hada, Cao Shunli, and countless others havesuffered repeated torture and other abuses at the hands of police and cellbosses under police control to punish them for their activism and to deterothers from challenging the state. They have experienced much of what isdescribed in this report and often worse.Key RecommendationsTransfer the power to manage detentioncenters from the Ministry of Public Security to the Ministry of Justice;Ensure that anyone taken into police custodybe promptly brought before a judge, normally within 48 hours of beingapprehended;Revise the Criminal Procedure Law to ensurethat suspects may have lawyers present during any police questioning andinterrogations, and stipulate suspects’ right to remain silent duringquestioning;Establish an independent Civilian PoliceCommission with power to conduct investigations with respect to  allegedpolice misconduct, including deaths in custody and police abuse;Amend the Detention Center Regulations toallow suspects to receive visits, phone calls, and letters from familieswithout prior detention center approval;Ensure that suspects have access to doctorsnot beholden to the police, and train doctors and psychiatrists who work withdetention centers to recognize evidence of torture and other mistreatment, bothphysical and psychological.MethodologyResearch for this report was conducted by Human Rights Watchresearchers in interviews and document reviews conducted between February andSeptember 2014, and in follow-up research through March 2015. As detailedbelow, the research included our analysis of 432 Chinese court verdictsaddressing detainee torture claims comes from a pool of 158,000 verdicts fromthe first four months of 2014, as well as Chinese media accounts of detaineeabuse cases from the same period.The scope of this research wasnecessarily limited by constraints imposed by the Chinese government. Thegovernment is hostile to research by international human rights organizations,and strictly limits the activities of domestic civil society organizations on avariety of subjects, particularly those related to human rights violations.This study was conducted during one of the most serious crackdowns on humanrights in recent years.Over the past two decades, a small number of diplomats,United Nations officials, members of the National People’s Congress andits local counterparts, and selected members of the Chinese public have beenallowed access to China’s detention centers. These visits have providedinvaluable information, but the government strictly controls the visits andonly sporadically grants them. Human RightsWatch did not have access to detention centers and relied on the corroboratedaccounts of others.Research for this reportincluded interviews with 48 former detainees, family members of detainees,lawyers, a former judge, a former police officer, academics, and members ofinternational and domestic nongovernmental organizations. Among these, 18 wereconducted with former detainees, nearly all of them criminal suspects who haveno known history of political dissent. We cross-checked individual accountsthrough interviews with co-defendants, other detainees, and family members, aswell as through examination of medical and detention records and official mediareports about the cases where available.The names and identifyingdetails of many of those with whom we spoke have been withheld to protect themfrom government reprisal. All names of detainees, their family members, andlawyers used in the report are pseudonyms. All those we interviewed wereinformed of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways inwhich the information would be used. All interviewees provided oral consent tobe interviewed. All were informed that they could decline to answer questionsor could end the interview at any time. No financial or other incentiveswere provided to individuals in exchange for their interviews. All interviews were conducted in Mandarin except thosewith international experts.Human Rights Watch sentletters to four government departments with questions related to the report(see Appendix I). Human Rights Watch has not received any response to them atthe time of publication.As noted above, a centralpart of the research was our search of a large database of Chinese courtverdicts—made possible by a Supreme People’s Court (SPC) decisionrequiring all courts to post decisions online starting January 1, 2014—andour analysis of the resulting subset of verdicts mentioning detainee torture claims(see Appendix II).[1]We looked at all verdicts in the SPC database fromthe period January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2014.Of about 158,000 criminalcourt verdicts available in the database for that period, Human Rights Watchfound a total of 432 in which criminal suspects alleged torture. We alsofound one verdict in which three police officers were put on trial for torture and 45 decisions in which 50 detainedcriminal suspects were held legally accountable for abusing detainees. Thesearched terms we used included “torture to extract confession” (xingxunbigong 刑讯逼供), “using violence to obtain evidence” (baoliquzheng 暴力取证), “abuse of supervisees” (nuedaibeijianguanren虐待被监管人), “intentional injury” (guyi shanghai故意伤害) and “same cell” (tongjianshi同监室), and “damaging orderly detention” (pohuaijianguan zhixu破坏监管秩序).[2]While these verdicts providea glimpse into how Chinese courts make decisions regarding allegations oftorture, the sample analyzed by Human Rights Watch (“the dataset”) almostcertainly does not include all torture cases from that time period. The SPCdecision regarding posting verdicts online provides exemptions for cases thatinvolve state secrets or personal privacy, and cases that are otherwise “notsuitable for making public,” which gives the courts wide latitude towithhold information.[3]Certain cases, such as major corruption casesinvolving higher level officials, seem to be missing from the SPC database.[4]In addition, many torture allegations made in court maynot be recorded in verdicts, and, of course, some detainees who have beenabused likely do not even raise the issue in court.Secondary sources HumanRights Watch consulted include Chinese government documents, laws, andpolicies; reports from domestic and international nongovernmentalorganizations; UN documents on torture in China; interviews with officials from foreign governments and internationalorganizations working on issues pertaining to torture, forced labor, and policeabuse; news articles from Chinese and international media; and writings byChinese and foreign academic experts on police abuse.This report does not addressabuses taking place outside of official criminal proceedings or those committedby forces other than that of the police under the Ministry of Public Security(MPS). It does not address abuses in administrative detention, arbitrarydetention or imprisonment, or abuses by the procuratorate.[5] It does not focus on the treatment of politicalsuspects held on state security charges. It also does not focus on police abusein Xinjiang or Tibet, where torture has been particularly severe, as it isespecially difficult to access criminal suspects there without putting them atrisk. The report does address the conditions of death row inmates andthose sentenced to short sentences, as they are held with criminal suspects andface similar conditions in pre-trial detention centers controlled by police.I. Torture in ChinaThe Chinese government has taken some steps, including strengthenedlegal and procedural protections, which if rigorously implemented would to someextent mitigate torture and other ill-treatment of detainees. Yet as several UNreviews have shown, few fundamental changes have actually been made.Findings of the UNCommittee against TortureThe United Nations Committeeagainst Torture, the international expert body responsible for monitoring statecompliance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumanor Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the “Convention againstTorture”), has reviewed China’srecord four times since 1988.[6] Together with the recommendations by the UN SpecialRapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment orPunishment, Manfred Nowak, who visited China in 2005, independent UN mechanismsand officials have made many recommendations to the Chinese government toaddress the problem (see Appendix III). While the Chinese government has madesome progress implementing a number of these recommendations, it has yet toimplement most of them, which would involve more sweeping and fundamentalchanges to the justice system, such as empowering the defense vis-à-visthe prosecution, and changing the power relationships among the police, theprocuratorate, and the courts.In its most recent review of China in 2008, the Committeeagainst Torture concluded that “notwithstanding the State party’sefforts to address the practice of torture and related problems in the criminaljustice system,” it remained “deeply concerned about the continuedallegations…of routine and widespread use of torture and ill-treatment ofsuspects in police custody.” In a written response to theCommittee’s concluding comments, the government defended its efforts,stating it has worked “conscientiously” and“unceasingly” to combat torture and these measures have“obtained notable results.”[7]China will appear again before the Committee against Torturein November 2015.Efforts to End Torture and Coerced ConfessionsThe People’s Republic of China’s first CriminalLaw, promulgated in 1979, imposed criminal penalties for coercing confessions.Through the 1980s, economic reforms and greater openness led to an explosion ofcrimes. The government’s slogan of “strictly prohibit[ing] coercedconfessions” became largely meaningless as authorities staged crimecrackdowns that focused on results rather than following procedures.[8]In the 1990s, the governmentundertook periodic campaigns that included raising police standards in criminalinvestigations and strengthening internal supervision and penalties fortorture, but without sufficient political will or procedural guarantees, theseefforts had almost no impact.[9] Since the 2000s, concerns over wrongful convictionshave been regularly featured in the speeches of top leaders, and authoritieshave enacted legislative and regulatory measures to combat the use of tortureto coerce confessions.During the two most recentrevisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, in 1996 and 2012, the government madechanges aimed at curtailing the use of torture to extract confessions.[10]During the 1996 revision, it reduced the importanceof confessions as criminal evidence.[11]In 2010, the case of Zhao Zuohai, which caused widespreadpublic outrage, prompted embarrassed Chinese law enforcement authorities and thejudiciary to promulgate a joint notice in 2010 with two sets of rules, one onthe exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, another on evidence used in deathpenalty cases.[12]The former—known as the exclusionaryrule—was codified in the 2012 revision of the Criminal Procedure Law.The exclusionary ruleprovides that suspects’ confessions and witness statements obtainedthrough “violence, threats and other illegal means” should beexcluded from evidence and cannot be used as a basis for “recommendationson prosecution, procurator decisions, or adjudication.”[13] It allows for a pretrial process in which the defensemay challenge confessions, outlines procedures and requirements for excludingthe confessions, and states that police officers may be compelled to appear incourt to give in-court testimony.[14] In addition to the exclusionary rule, the MPS hassince 2010, also supported the videotaping of police interrogations andcurrently requires videotapes for cases involving capital offenses, lifeimprisonment, and “other major crimes.”[15]The MPS announced six months after the 2012revisions came into effect that there had been an 87 percent drop in coercedconfessions nationwide.[16]The Chinese exclusionary rulenotably does not incorporate the “fruit of the poisonous tree”doctrine. This doctrine, which the UN special rapporteur on torture considersto be part of international law, extends the rule beyond confessionsobtained from torture and ill-treatment to “all other pieces of evidencesubsequently obtained through legal means, but which originated in an act oftorture.”[17]Efforts to Combat Deaths in Custody and Cell BossesIn February 2009, the Chinese media reported that LiQiaoming, a 24-year-old criminal suspect in Yunnan province, had died fromfatal brain trauma. Authorities initially claimed that he had died during ajailhouse game of “hide-and-seek” (duomaomao 躲猫猫). Butafter details of the case spread over the Internet, they acknowledged thatthree fellow inmates had beaten Li to death. Following this and other cases ofsevere abuses against detainees being reported in the media, the SupremePeople’s Procuratorate and the MPS adopted new measures to improvepractices in detention centers.[18]The MPS says these measures have been in use since 2009, andthey include surveillance cameras in detainee living quarters that can beviewed in real time by procurators on duty in detention centers, alarms in cellsso that bullied detainees can report abuses to guards, physical barriers ininterrogation rooms separating police officers and suspects, cooperation withlocal hospitals to provide better health care to suspects, and physicalcheck-ups before suspects can be admitted in detention centers, among others.[19]The MPS has also “prohibited the use of detainees inmanagement”—a euphemism for cell bosses—and instead has statedthat “all the activities of detainees” should be “implementedby the police directly.”[20]The MPS claims that since the end of 2011 it has hired “specialsupervisors”—individuals outside of the police system—tocarry out periodic, unannounced visits to 70 percent of its detention centersto check on conditions.[21]Authorities also staged a campaign against cell bosses,including by seeking criminal charges against 36 cell bosses and disciplinaryactions against 166 police officers.[22]In March 2010, a year after the campaign’s launch, the MPS announced thatthere had been no deaths in custody over the preceding year for which cellbosses were responsible.[23]In May 2012 the MPS announcedthat it was revising the 1990 Detention Center Regulations and drafting a lawto replace it to address some of the legal loopholes enabling the abuse ofcriminal suspects. The draft has not yet been made public, but the Chinese domesticpress has reported on some aspects of it. One key issue is which ministryshould have the power to manage detention centers. Scholars have advocated thatthey be transferred to a neutral party to avoid police abuse.[24]But the MPS is reportedly reluctant to give upcontrol over detention centers because of the information it is said to obtainby covertly monitoring suspects or through informants.[25]About 12.5 percent of all crimes solved by the policeare said to have been discovered this way.[26]In 2009, the MPS responded to criticisms of itsmanagement of detention centers by vesting leadership of crime investigationsand management of detention centers in two different local police vice chiefs.[27]Criminal Procedures and Time LimitsOnce thepolice identify criminal suspects, they can place the suspects under fivetypes of coercive measures. Police can summon suspects (juchuan 拘传),[28]put them under criminal detention(xingshi juliu 刑事拘留), formally arrest them (daibu 逮捕), subject them to residentialsurveillance (jianshi juzhu 监视居住), or allow them to be released onbail pending trial (qubao houshen 取保候审).[29]Thespecific process and time it takes for a suspect to go through the criminaldetention system varies considerably. At each step of the criminal process,the Criminal Procedure Law allows the police to extend the deadline undercertain circumstances, such as if the suspect has provided no identificationinformation, or if police discover new crimes. There are no safeguards in the law to prevent the police fromrepeatedly manipulating these procedural rules and detain a suspectindefinitely.Typically,after the police first summon a suspect, they can hold them for up to 24hours before formal criminal detention. Suspects must then be transferred toa detention center within 24 hours after formal detention (but as discussedin Chapter IV below, the period before suspects arrive at a detention centercan be further extended). From the day suspects are formally detained, policehave up to 37 days, during which they can subject suspects to repeatedinstances of incommunicado interrogation, before the procuratorate approvestheir arrests.[30]It can then take months andsometimes years before the police finish their investigation and theprocurator decides to prosecute the suspect.[31]If there is an indictment by theprocurator, the suspect is put on trial, and, if convicted, can appeal and begiven a second trial. Once the convicted defendant exhausts avenues for orabandons their appeal, they are transferred from the detention center to aprison. Only if the defendant’s sentence is less than three months, orif they are on death row, will they remain at the detention center.Few criminal suspects are given bail while awaiting trial, contrary tointernational standards.[32]Most suspects are held indetention centers (kanshousuo 看守所), for months while they awaittrial. These facilities are often overcrowded, have poor food and rudimentaryhealth care.[33]Suspects have few rights underChinese law to challenge the decision to hold them in pre-trial detention.[34]TheInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signedbut not yet ratified, states that “[i]t shall not be the general rulethat persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody, but release may besubject to guarantees to appear for trial.” It also states that thosedenied bail need to be tried as expeditiously as possible.[35]State’s Obligations to Prevent Torture and OtherIll-treatmentUnder international law, governments have the obligation toprotect all those in their custody from harm to their person and uphold theright of detainees to be held in humane conditions and treated with dignity.[36]The Convention against Torture prohibits the use of torture,which is basically defined as the intentional infliction of pain or suffering,whether physical or mental, for the purpose of obtaining information or aconfession, or as a punishment, by a public official or agent.[37]Also prohibited is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,referred to as “ill-treatment.”[38]Governments are obligated to ensure that any statement“made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in anyproceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that thestatement was made.”[39]They are required to conduct “a prompt and impartial investigation”by “competent authorities” when they receive complaints of tortureand punish “all acts of torture” in criminal law.[40]Victims of torture should be given “fair and adequate compensation”as well as physical and psychological rehabilitation.[41]Similar obligations apply in cases of ill-treatment not amounting to torture.[42]Although the word “torture” (kuxing 酷刑) exists inChinese, the term is not used in domestic law or media reports. A search onChina’s most popular search engine, Baidu, for “kuxing”brings up articles that describe the use of torture in ancient times, ratherthan in the contemporary era. Instead, the government uses the term“coerced confession” (xingxun bigong刑讯逼供), defined as“corporal or quasi-corporal” punishment by judicial officers that“inflicts severe physical or mental pain or suffering” to forcesuspects to confess, and makes it a criminal offense.[43]It also criminalizes the same behavior when used against witnesses to compeltestimonies, as well as corporal punishment of detainees in institutions ofconfinement.[44]The UN Committee against Torture has repeatedly raisedconcerns that the Chinese government “has not incorporated in itsdomestic law a definition of torture that fully complies” with theconvention’s definition.[45]One of the problems was that at the time the committee last reviewed China, thelaw only prohibited physical, but not mental or psychological, pain.[46]The Chinese government made some progress toward addressingthis problem when the Supreme People’s Court issued a judicialinterpretation in 2012 that for the first time recognized the infliction ofsevere mental pain as an act of torture.[47]But the law does not specify the types of behaviors that would constitute suchmental pain. In November 2013, the Supreme People’s Court issued anopinion document that elaborated upon the types of coercion prohibited incriminal investigations, noting that the following were not permissible:“freezing, starving, shining [a spotlight on], hanging up, and fatiguingthe accused.”[48]However, because this document is not a judicial interpretation (guidelines totrials which are nationally enforceable), its legal status and thus its powerin guiding judges’ decisions are questionable. Consequently,interrogation tactics such as prolonged sleep deprivation remain lawful.[49]The government has also yet to address the problem that thelaws do not clearly prohibit the use of torture except for the purpose ofextracting confessions.[50]The laws only prohibit torture by judicial officers and officers of detentionfacilities and do not cover torture by all “others acting in an officialcapacity, including those acts that result from instigation, consent oracquiescence of a public official,” such as torture by cell bosses.[51]The Committee against Torture has indicated that the state has an obligation toprevent mistreatment of detainees not only by police and penitentiaryofficials, but also by other inmates.[52]Chinese law also contains other significant gaps that leadto weak protections against torture and other ill-treatment. [53]Under the law, police interrogate suspects in detention centers and policestations in the absence of lawyers and other third parties.[54]While Chinese law stipulates that suspects have the right to appoint and meetwith lawyers, few have the means or opportunity to seek legal counsel. There isno right to legal aid for the vast majority of suspects. As a result, mostsuspects have no access to lawyers.[55]Although the Chinese government introduced a provision in the revisions of the2012 CPL that allows suspects to refuse to answer questions that incriminatethemselves, the law continues to require them to “answertruthfully” in police interrogations, rendering the new provision largelymeaningless and ineffective.Protections againstself-incrimination do not include the right of suspects to remain silent.[56]The UN Committee against Torture considers prompt access toa lawyer as among the “fundamental legal safeguards to prevent tortureand ill treatment during detention as well as to ensure a fair legalproceeding.”[57]The committee stated:Access to legal representationentails the prompt confidential access to and consultations in private with anindependent lawyer or a counsel of the detainee's own choice, in a language heor she understands, from the moment of deprivation of liberty and throughoutthe detention but especially during the interrogation, investigation and questioningprocess. [58]Applicable Law on Restraints and Solitary ConfinementWhile police may at times use restraints on individuals incustody, international human rights standards have strict procedures andconditions for their use. The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment ofPrisoners provide that instruments of restraint should only be used as strictlynecessary to prevent risk of harm to individuals or others, and they are not tobe used for punishment.[59]China’s Detention Center Regulations make similar stipulations.[60]Both international standards and Chinese law provide that when restraints areused, there should be efforts to limit discomfort, pain, or injuries.[61]However, China’s relevant regulations allowindividuals be restrained for up to fifteen days, and this period can beextended further upon authorization from the head of the PSB.[62]This contravenes international standards, which advise that the use ofrestraints be as short as possible, that is, minutes rather than hours or days.[63]The Committee against Torture has advised that detainees should be guaranteedtheir due process rights when subjected to disciplinary actions,“including to be informed in writing of the charges against them,”and “to be provided a copy of any disciplinary decision,” amongothers.[64]But Chinese detention regulations do not set out such due process protections.The regulations also require detainees on deathrow—who are held in detention centers instead of prisons—to wearrestraints at all times while they await execution.[65]This contravenes the comments of the UN Committee against Torture, which statesthat the status or legal condition of a detainee “cannot be reason toautomatically impose restraints.”[66]China’s Detention Center Regulations allow for the useof solitary confinement, called “small cell” (xiaohao 小号), for up to 15days upon authorization by the head of the detention center. That form ofconfinement could follow “serious” cases of breaches of DetentionCenter Regulations, such as “spreading corrupt thoughts,”“damaging public property,” or getting into fights.[67]The Committee against Torture has stated that the use of solitary confinementshould be prohibited for pre-trial detainees.[68]Applicable Law on Deaths in CustodyInternational standards set out that all death-in-custodycases should be subjected to “thorough, prompt and impartialinvestigation,” including those in which relatives or other reliablesources suggest unnatural death.[69]As the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executionshas noted, since there is a presumption of state responsibility due to thecustodial setting and the government’s obligation to ensure and respectthe right to life, the government has to affirmatively provide evidence torebut the presumption of state responsibility. Absent proof that it is notresponsible, the government has an obligation to provide reparations to thefamily of the deceased.[70]Beyond obligations to prosecute wrongful deaths, theauthorities also need to take measures to prevent deaths in custody and respondeffectively to the causes of death, including by ensuring proper oversight andadequate medical care to detainees.[71]Families should have access to “all information relevant to theinvestigation” and the government should release the results of theinvestigation in the form of a written report.[72]In cases in which the “established investigative procedures areinadequate because of lack of expertise or impartiality” or where thereare complaints from the family about these problems, the government should“pursue investigations through an independent commission ofinquiry.”[73]The Chinese government issued regulations addressing deathsin custody after the string of custodial deaths in 2009.[74]According to the procedures, the police should “immediately notify”the family, and then “immediately conduct” an investigation intothe cause of death. The investigation includes viewing and preserving thesurveillance video of the detention cell, questioning fellow detainees, doctors,and guards, checking and preserving all related health and detention records,taking photos and videos of the body, and identifying the cause of death. Oncethe cause has been determined, police should notify the family and submit areport to the procuratorate. The police and the procuratorate can also order aforensic agency to carry out an autopsy, which family members and their legalrepresentatives can attend. The procuratorate should review the police report,and conduct its own investigation in cases of “unnatural” deaths,which include deaths due to abuse but not those due to illness. Theprocuratorate is also empowered to conduct its own investigation if thedeceased’s family disagrees with or questions the results of the policeinvestigation.[75]Among the shortcomings in the regulations is that they donot set out parameters for how long investigations should take. They also donot require that the agency carrying out the investigation be independent orimpartial. While the regulations require that police notify the family of theinvestigation’s findings, they do not oblige the police to give thefamily a full report or disclose full details.[76]Structure and Supervision of the Public Security PolicePrior to1979, China’s police force primarily functioned as a politicalinstrument of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to eliminate political rivalsand cement the Party’s power; responding to ordinary crime was a lesserpriority. Since the reforms beginning in 1979 which provided for a more openeconomy, common crime has soared, and the police have increasingly taken on alaw enforcement role.[77]There arefive types of police in China: this report focuses on the public securitypolice under the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which makes up the vastmajority (86 percent) of the country’s two million police officers.[78]Public securitypolice have several main duties, including the investigation of most criminaloffenses, and managing the detention centers where criminal suspects areheld.[79]The MPSguides the operations of the four lower levels of public security servicesthrough drafting rules and regulations.[80]But it is local leaders—CCPcommittee and government officials at the same level—that fund thepolice force, appoint personnel including the local police chiefs, determinepolice salaries, and set policing priorities.[81]The CCP controls the policethrough its committees in each level of the public security service, andthrough its Political and Legal Committee (zhengfawei 政法委), which lead and coordinate thepolice, the procuratorate, and the courts on law and order matters. Thestrong local party-state control makes the police susceptible to localpolitical influences.[82]The powerof the police has increased substantially in recent years, particularly underthe leadership of Zhou Yongkang, who was minister of public security from2002 to 2007.[83]Zhou made police chiefs the centerof local power by having them appointed as secretaries of the CCP politicaland legal committees.[84]He expanded the nationwidepolitical repression or “stability maintenance” (weiwen 维稳) infrastructure, furtherempowering the police.[85]This situation began to changearound 2010, when the CCP ordered separation of the roles of police chiefsand secretaries of political and legal committees at the provincial level.[86]While the MPS has been put undergreater CCP control under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, itcontinues to be powerful.[87]II. Police Abuse in Pretrial DetentionTorture to extract confession has become an unspoken rule,it is very common.—ZhengQianyang (pseudonym), former policeofficer, Heilongjiang province, February 2014Chinese officials havecharacterized the use of torture as “nationwide,”“common,” and “serious,”[88]while Chinese scholars analyzing prominent cases ofwrongful convictions involving capital offenses concluded that over 80 percentof these cases involved torture.[89]Some lawyers interviewed byHuman Rights Watch said the problem of torture in police interrogations has“become less serious” in non-political criminal cases because of recentlegal reforms aimed at reducing torture. But other lawyers and former detaineestold us that torture remains a serious problem. These variations may be due todifferences of locale, prevalence of crime, varying resources available to lawenforcement agencies, and other factors. The 432 allegations of torturedocumented in court verdicts analyzed by Human Rights Watch, however, occurredin 30 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.[90]Our research also shows that criminal suspects are at riskof ill-treatment in detention at times other than during interrogations. So-calledcell bosses, detainees who act as de facto managers of a cell, at timesmistreat or beat detainees. Police subject some detainees to the use ofrestraints in so-called stress positions or prolonged solitary confinement topunish them, or to force them to work long hours without pay. While authoritiessay that the numbers are down, detainees continue to die in custody, in many casesallegedly due to torture and ill-treatment by police officers, guards, and fellowdetainees, or prolonged lack of adequate medical attention.[91]Physical and PsychologicalAbuses during InterrogationsChinese criminal law currently prohibits infliction ofsevere physical or mental pain or suffering to coerce suspects to confess duringpolice interrogations.[92]But criminal suspects who spoke to Human Rights Watch reported these methodscontinue to be used. They described similar methods in different provinces.Many of these methods can also be found in Chinese press reports.[93]They include:Being hit with hands, police batons,electric batons, hammers, iron bars;Kicking;Spraying with pain-inducing substancesincluding chili oil (poured into one’s nose or onto one’sgenitals);Exposure to sustained cold (cold watersprayed on a naked suspect in a sub-zero temperature room);Blinding with a hot, white light;Forcing individuals to maintain a stressposition for prolonged periods;Deprivation of sleep, water, and food.Criminal defense lawyers described some common methods ofabuse. Beijing-based lawyer Shen Mingde, who focuses on procedural violationsin the criminal system, told Human Rights Watch that many types of torture areused in China:There are countless [methods of torture]! For example,it’s cold in northeast China, so the police take off all theperson’s clothes, string him up and beat him, hitting his anus andgenitalia with electric batons, slap him on his face, beat, and kick him. Foranother example, in Loudi, Hunan, there was another typical case, in which theytied the person’s hands behind his back to what we call a “tigerchair” or “iron chair” …. [T]hey also strung someone upon the window frame, made him squat for a long time without moving.[94]A former police officer from Heilongjiang Province, who leftthe police force in 2011, told Human Rights Watch that the use of physical andpsychological abuses by police is common:Almost all suspects in criminal cases have been subject toabuses like … beatings and scolding, sleep deprivation, dehydration, andthreats … Basically every public security bureau has a “tigerchair,” electric batons and others like that. They keep such tools [inthe office].[95]Victims and lawyers reported beatings and kickings. Wu Ying,a lawyer who has practiced for over two decades, told Human Rights Watch:Yes, there is torture … like using electric batons, tyingtheir hands at the back and beatings. The cases I usually come across involvehitting anuses, genitalia, and toes with electric batons.[96]Beijing-based lawyer Luo Chenghu described a case he handledin 2012, in which his client, a farmer charged with homicide, was tortured:[They] hit him with rods … forover one hour every consecutive day … he was not the only one beaten, hisfather and a relative were detained for over 30 days and they got beaten too.[97]Gu Daoying, who runs a gambling parlor in Zhejiang province,told Human Rights Watch that police tortured him after they took him intocustody:[They] handcuffedboth my hands and beat me, hitting and kicking was the least of it all. [Onepolice officer] used an electric baton to hit me for six to seven hours, morethan a hundred times. I fainted many times, and lost control over urination.Later he put his police baton on the floor and forced me to kneel on it forthree hours.[98]Click to expand ImageIllustration of police beating a detainee on the ground, withboth of his hands in handcuffs behind his back. Human Rights Watch commissionedthis and two other drawings below based on descriptions of torture andill-treatment by former detainees and lawyers.[99] (c) 2015Russell Christian for Human Rights WatchClick to expand ImageIllustration of a suspect hung up on the iron grill of thewindow. Some former detainees say they were hung by their handcuffs, which isespecially painful as the handcuffs cut into the flesh. (c) 2015 RussellChristian for Human Rights WatchOne common method is to string up the suspect by the wristsusing handcuffs or ropes, sometimes with arms tied backwards. Chen Zhongshen,from Hunan Province, described how police officers tortured him: “Theyhandcuffed me and then hung the handcuffs on the windows, just like this, heelsoff the ground… the handcuffs cut into my flesh. I was hung like adog.”[100]Other suspects also reported being beaten while hung up bytheir wrists:They wrapped a cloth around my wrists then they handcuffedme, they tied a rope to the chain between the handcuffs and hung me on thepulley on the ceiling, my toes barely touching the ground. They shocked myhands with an electric baton, and they even stuck the baton into my right-handpocket to hit my genitals. …I could not take it after about seven oreight minutes so I begged them to let me down so I could think things through.[101]Interviewees noted that substances like chili oil are used toinflict pain or severe discomfort on suspects. Zhang Chun told Human RightsWatch: “They covered my mouth, and poured chili oil into my nostril, itran inside and everywhere on my nose, mouth and face.”[102]Some lawyers told Human Rights Watch that police have becomesophisticated in their infliction of pain of suspects, and they employtechniques that leave little or no physical trace. They describe police usingtowels, books, helmets, or other items to cushion the site of injury, so as tocreate intense pain but leave no visible marks. Lawyer Luo Chenghu told HumanRights Watch:Nowadays police officers beat people up with techniques. Whenthis kid was beaten, they padded him with a thick [stack of documents], [sothat the blows would] leave no [lasting], visible marks. It would be gone in under10 days.[103]Shanghai-based lawyer Song Sanzuo, who has been a criminaldefense lawyer since 1999, said:The use of direct physical pain has reduced greatly, but physicalpain in a disguised form has increased, like continued interrogations with thepolice officers taking turns to exhaust suspects, or threatening and puttingmental pressure on suspects and so on, threatening to arrest family members ofsuspects, all of these are illegal.[104]The use of sleep deprivation appears to be endemic. YuZhenglu, who is in his 30s, told Human Rights Watch that he was strapped in aninterrogation chair and prevented from sleeping for over 96 hours:[They] accused me of money laundering and illegallydetained me for four days and four nights without food, water, or medication. Ihave high blood pressure…. They also didn’t let me sleep for fourdays and four nights. The police changed shifts every four hours, and as soonas you close your eyes, they push you.[105]Lei Xinmu, a farmer in his late 20s, described similarill-treatment to Human Rights Watch. Lei was accused of robbery, which he saidhe did not commit: “I was sitting on a ‘tiger chair,’ andthere were two spotlights on top on my head, they took turns to talk to me …they would not let me rest, I couldn’t take it any longer.”[106]After over 200 hours of sleep deprivation, Lei did not confess to the crime.After a few weeks of detention, police released him due to lack of evidence.According to the Committee against Torture, sleepdeprivation used to extract a confession is “impermissible,”[107]and prolonged periods of sleep deprivation constitute torture.[108]PolicePressure to Solve CrimesPolicerely on torture and ill-treatment to obtain confessions for several reasons.The criminal system considers confessions to be the “king,” orultimate form, of evidence, and the system is arranged in ways that maximizeopportunities for investigators to obtain such evidence.[109]Police are expected to extract aconfession in every case, which they then use to conduct an investigation tocorroborate the confession.[110]Althoughthe government has spent hundreds of billions of yuan in recent years for“stability maintenance” projects across the country,[111]police, particularly at the locallevel, often have inadequate financial or human resources to properlyinvestigate crimes.[112]In addition, outside of majorcities, police officers are often insufficiently trained and lack basicknowledge of how to conduct criminal investigations.[113]This under-resourcing for crimecontrol makes it expedient for the police to rely on torture, which theyconsider the most efficient means of obtaining the necessary evidence forcriminal prosecutions and convictions.Individualofficers’ promotion through the ranks and other financial or materialrewards are often based on assessment criteria that include clearance rates,the number of crimes solved compared to the number of crimes reported topolice.[114]The requirements that officersneed to reach a certain clearance rate—over 90 percent in someareas—puts tremendous pressure on officers to solve crimes.[115]The MPS prohibited the use ofclearance rates in evaluations in 2011, and a number of provincial police bureausfollowed this important step, but it is yet unclear how effective theseformal announcements have been on police behavior.[116]Lawyerstold Human Rights Watch that police officers in charge of investigationssometimes beat suspects to get them to admit to crimes they did not commit orto testify against others as complicit in crimes. One lawyer described afather and son held separately; both were beaten and told that the other hadconfessed against him.[117]In some cases the suspects alreadyhad admitted to the crimes voluntarily but the police coerced them to confessto other similar crimes that the suspects insisted they did not commit. Inone case, a suspect confessed quickly to a robbery and provided details andinformation about his fellow robbers. The suspect was then strung up andbeaten while police demanded he confess to other robberies.[118]Cases inWhich Torture is Particularly LikelyMost ofthe cases of torture described in this report involve suspects charged withtheft, drug sales, or robberies, all common crimes in China.[119]But a number of lawyers weinterviewed said that torture is particularly common and severe in murdercases, triad-related crimes, and corruption cases.[120]In recentyears, the most prominent cases of torture to extract confessions reported bymainland Chinese media have involved the latter categories of crimes, such asthe case of Zhao Zuohai, accused of homicide, and that of Vincent Wu, accusedof triad activity. Thesecrimes have been specifically targeted for crackdowns by the centralgovernment in recent years because they tend to attract widespread publiccondemnation and attention.[121]The government has clearly made apriority of murder cases; the MPS announced in 2013 that the national ratefor solving murders was 95.5 percent.[122]Some cities, such as Urumqi inXinjiang, claimed a 100 percent rate for solving murders in 2013.[123]Lawyers weinterviewed said that in these “major cases,” there is politicalpressure coming from the top to solve them, thus further weakening anyprocedural protections—however limited—that otherwise might existin Chinese criminal law for the defendants.[124]Theinvestigation and prosecution of such cases can create an environmentespecially conducive to torture and other ill-treatment, largely becauseofficials from the procuratorate and the court are made to work together as agroup (lianhe ban’an 联合办案).[125]Local governments set up“Special Investigation Units” (zhuan’anzu 专案组) involving the supposedly separatebranches of police, procuratorate, the court, and the Party’sDisciplinary Commission in cases involving official misconduct. Together, andunder the leadership of the local Communist Party Political and LegalCommittee, the units “study the case to see how to convict”[126]the suspects.Thesethree categories of crimes numerically make up a small proportion—about6 percent—of the 432 allegations of torture documented in courtverdicts Human Rights Watch analyzed. But the severity of the torture, andthe fact that these get considerable public and media attention, means theymake a disproportionately large impact on public confidence in the justicesystem.Violence and Mistreatment by “Cell Bosses”The 2009 string of deaths in detention centers, includingthe infamous “hide-and-seek” death of Li Qiaoming described in ChapterI of the report, generated public outrage that pushed the government toacknowledge the problem of cell bosses—detainees who organize and abuseothers on behalf of detention authorities. In 2009, the Deputy Procurator-Generalof the SPP Jiang Jianchu acknowledged the severity of the problem in apublished interview:We must admit that [abuse by] cell bosses have indeed beenan ongoing problem for a long time. However, it is quite difficult to resolvethis problem, and so I can only say that we will continue working hard totackle the issue.[127]In 2009, the SPP and the MPS announced a series of promisingmeasures, including increased monitoring of detainees’ living quarters toprevent violence by cell bosses.[128]In 2014, the Ministry of Public Security said the problem of cell bosses hadbeen “effectively curbed.”[129]Yet former detainees and defense lawyers told Human RightsWatch that cell bosses continue to be commonly used as de facto managers ofcells and act as the intermediaries between detainees and the police officers.Many facets of life—including where to sleep and organizing the purchaseof extra food and necessities—are under the management of the cellbosses.Former detainee Yuan Yifan, who is in his 30s and had beenin a Guangzhou detention center, told Human Rights Watch that although cellbosses have new titles, they continue to function as de facto guards indetention centers:They are no longer called "cell bosses” butinstead "persons on duty." The police only patrol twice a day, oncein the morning and in the afternoon. For the rest of the day, these"persons on duty" are in charge of keeping the order and assigningduties.… These are theoretically duties of the guards, but in practicethey are carried out by these "persons on duty."[130]The level of mistreatment and abuse employed by the cellbosses varies. Wang said those in his detention center had not mistreatedfellow detainees: “There are still jail bosses, but the situation isbetter than before. Corporal punishment and verbal abuse are still being used,but they are less harsh.”[131]Others said physical abuse was common. Lawyer Wu Ying whospent months in a detention center in a southern province said he witnessed“simple beatings”:Some cell bosses … often beat others, I was abusedtoo … the way they abuse people is to make them stand on dirty toilets,also simple beatings. Now there are surveillance cameras, hitting is lesscommon. Sometimes you still have seven or eight people ganging up on someone.[132]Detainee Zuo Yi said beatings were very serious in theFujian province detention center where he was detained; a cell boss therethreatened to “torture him to death slowly.” He recalled onebeating:He [the cell boss] used a clothes hanger, [he] put [my]hands on the bed and hit them with the hanger until the fingers were broken …it continued for a long time.[133]Cell bosses mistreat and beat fellow detainees for a varietyof reasons, in some cases, they dislike particular detainees or want to extortmoney from them. A detainee from Henan Province, Feng Kun, told Human RightsWatch:In detention centers, if you haveno connections you get beat up [by the cell boss], if you have connections youare safe and you get to share the benefits. You are fine as long as your familysends money.[134]Another main function of cell bosses is to act as thecell’s production manager in the many detention centers that requiredetainees to work without pay. Cell bosses divide the work among thecell’s detainees and failure to work quickly enough or accomplish theindividual quotas assigned appears to be one of the main reasons cell bossesabuse fellow detainees. Zuo Yi, who was detained in Fujian, told Human RightsWatch: “They bring your work in for you to do every day, you have to dowhatever they told you to or they will beat you.”[135]Former detainee Tong Shenmu said cell bosses use violentmistreatment as punishment for violating cell “rules”:Beatings [by jail bosses] are mostly related to work. Butthere were also instances when the jail bosses beat detainees for disobedienceof their rules … they have rules about when you can use the bathroom …and if you break the rule, you would get beaten up. But most of the time you getbeaten up for not doing the work.[136]Similarly American teacher Stuart Foster, who spent monthsin Guangzhou’s Baiyun Detention Center, told Human Rights Watch that cellbosses punished detainees who were slow in their work:All through the assembly process, the gang [cellbosses]—the leader with assistants appointed—would go around andhit people or whip them to spur production. Again, anyone who they deem slowwould not get a smoking break that day. If they continue to be a problem …then they would be brought to the front of the cell, usually at night over workand they’d be forced to face the wall like this, down on their knees andthey would receive hits on their heads and kicks to their ribs … theymight also cut your food ration in half … those were relatively common[punishments].[137]Detainees told Human Rights Watch that cell bosses have aclose relationship with the guards, who gave them favorable treatment includingextra cigarettes and warm tea. Although much of the violence and mistreatmentfrom cell bosses appears to be part of their “management style” toinstill fear and obedience among inmates, some is done on the behest of theguards.[138]Interviewees have also reported that cell bosses beat detainees to extractfurther confessions and information from them, either at their own initiative,or because they were instructed by the police to make the detainee“cooperate” with the investigation. Zuo Yi told Human Rights Watch:He [the cell boss] wanted to get credits to get hissentence reduced. He made me confess [to further crimes] and I wouldn’t,that was why he abused me. Maybe also he didn’t like me, those were thetwo reasons.[139]Yu Zheng, a lawyer from Shanghai who has been practicingsince 1992, told Human Rights Watch: “If you don’t obey, they tellthe cell bosses to beat you, like when you don’t confess.”[140]Another Shanghai-based lawyer, Song Sanzuo, said:Some cell bosses are in their nature abusive; but aminority [abuses others] when instructed by the police guarding the cell. Theformer is common everywhere in the world—abusing newcomers, forcing themto sleep next to the toilets; the latter is when the guards want to get thesuspect to cooperate, they ask the cell boss to “teach them alesson,” for their bad attitude.[141]Use of Restraints and SolitaryConfinementPolice officers regularly use restraints—known as the“tiger chair”—to immobilize suspects during interrogations.Former detainees told Human Rights Watch that they were strapped in this metalchair for hours and even days, deprived of sleep, and immobilized until theirlegs and buttocks were swollen.Former detainee Ma Yingying told Human Rights Watch that shewas strapped to this device for weeks, during which time she lost considerableweight and fainted multiple times:I sat on an iron chair all day, morning and night, my handsand legs were buckled. During the day I could nap on the chair, but when thecadres came, they scolded the police for letting me doze off.… I satuntil my buttocks bled.[142]Former detainee Lei Xinmu said:The “tiger chair” is an iron chair, its ironbuckles fastened around your hands and feet. I sat on the tiger chair, and hadtwo spotlights shining on top of my head, they took turns talking to me …and they did not let me sleep, I could not stand it … [I was buckled inthe chair] for nine days and nights.[143]Click to expand ImageIllustration of a suspect restrained inwhat the police call an “interrogation chair,” but commonly knownas a “tiger chair.” Former detainees and lawyers interviewed saythat police often strap suspects into these metal chairs for hours and evendays, often depriving them of sleep and food, and immobilizing them until theirlegs and buttocks are swollen.(c) 2015 Russell Christian for Human Rights WatchSome police have acknowledged the use of this device, butthey contend that it is used to prevent suspects from harming themselves andothers. According to a written statement by the Guiyang City Public SecurityBureau:The "tiger chair" is in fact an“interrogation chair” used by the public security authoritiesaccording to the relevant provisions of the Ministry of Public Security ... thechair is to restrain suspects for preventing them from suicides orself-injuries or against violence or attacks against interrogators.[144]According to an MPS notice, interrogation rooms should beequipped with “special seats” for suspects that should be“secure” and “fixed to the ground” with “safetyfeatures.”[145]But the notice did not give details as to the kinds of features this seatshould have, the circumstances under which the chair should be used, or howlong suspects can be strapped to the chair. While police have contended thechair is for protecting suspects from hurting themselves or others, therelevant regulations governing police equipment and restraints do not includeinterrogation chairs.[146]Detention center staff also regularly use handcuffs and legirons on detainees.[147]Relevant regulations require that detainees on death row awaiting court review oftheir cases and convicted inmates awaiting execution be restrained at all timesusing leg irons and handcuffs, often with leg irons and handcuffs linkedtogether, presumably to prevent escape.[148]This could mean months and sometimes even years in restraints as detaineesappeal their cases.One detainee convicted of homicide whose appeal of his deathsentence was pending had been handcuffed and shackled in leg irons in anuncomfortable position for 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the past eightyears, according to a family member:He lives with handcuffs and leg irons, for eight years hehas lived like that. In the letters he sent, he said what he wanted the mostwas to “be able to put on clothes and eat on his own,” but hecan’t. He is less than an animal, which is extremely cruel. In the detentioncenter, he is so tightly fastened, when it is winter and so cold, he can onlywrap clothes around himself. It is also difficult for him to use the toilet. Hecannot straighten his body, the chains [in between handcuffs and leg irons] arevery short.[149]Long-time Beijing-based human rights lawyer Ze Zhong toldHuman Rights Watch:Prisoners with death sentences are guarded more strictly.Once the sentence is handed down, they have to wear handcuffs and leg irons… their hands and feet are shackled together, they cannot stand upstraight, for usually between eight months and a year between their sentenceand execution.[150]Detention centers also use painful restraints for prolongedperiods to punish detainees for bad behavior, such as fighting other detainees,and failure to obey the staff’s orders or detention center rules. Formerdetainee Li Fang, who is in her 50s, recalled one episode in which a fellowdetainee was chained for days:We had to sit still and were not allowed to talk. You werephysically punished if you talked. There was one woman who was quite deaf, andshe couldn’t hear the guard, who said we were not allowed to talk. Shemoved and she was handcuffed to an iron bar with her hands twisted behind her,and they left her there for two to three days, even during meal times or sleep.I felt sorry for her so I held a bucket for her for when she needed to urinateor defecate.[151]Former detainees we interviewed all noted that thispunishment is particularly uncomfortable and painful, because the leg irons areheavy and make it difficult for the detainees to move or stand to their fullheight, or cut into their skin. Lawyer Wu Ying, who was held in a detentioncenter, explained:Handcuffs and leg irons were common when peopledidn’t obey the detention center rules. One way was to make you wearboth, it means that the handcuffs and leg irons are chained together, and theyare heavy. You can’t take them off even in sleep; it is uncomfortablebecause you can’t straighten yourself.[152]Detainees sometimes have also been chained to a stationeryobject in the cell, so they effectively cannot move for the period of thepunishment. Former detainee Stuart Foster told Human Rights Watch that:In the eight months, there were four occasions [on whichrestraints were used], that was generally because detainees were not workingand were causing disruptions like arguments and fights.… Two differentinmates were chained to the floor for two weeks, which meant they were unableto go to the toilet, another inmate would bring them a bucket. When you werechained to the floor they’d cut your ration, I remember one boy that …in the two weeks he was chained to the floor by the end he looked like he wasdying of starvation.[153]In some detention centers, detainees are required to sit inone position for hours without moving, which can be very painful. Formerdetainee Yuan Yifan said:We had to sit all day from the timewe woke up to until bedtime. We couldn't even stretch our legs but we had tosit cross-legged. Except for when we did [group] exercise or during breaks, wehad to sit without even changing the direction [we face]. My legs were stillswollen weeks after I got out of the detention center.[154]Former detainee Yang Zhenling described a similar situation:They forbid us from lying down in bed or walking around[the cell], and we had to sit cross-legged in a certain area for at least eighthours a day. That was effectively torture, and it was painful.[155]Detainees told Human Rights Watch that the restraint periodscan be days or even weeks depending on the “mood of the guards.”Zuo Yi, who now works as a driver after release from a Fujian detention center,told Human Rights Watch:So many of them wear handcuffs and leg irons … theamount of time is totally up to guards’ mood to decide, sometimes twoweeks, sometimes 8 to 10 days.[156]Wu Ying said:As to how long you have to wear them, it depends on theguard’s moods. In our cell one man was wearing them for two to three weeks.[157]Several detainees said that they witnessed others subject tosolitary confinement during pre-trial detention. Ma Yingying said:There were two women who fought. Whoever fought had to belocked up [in solitary confinement], for one or two days, it depends on howserious were the fights. The guards could decide how many days you would bedetained.[158]Tong Shenmu, a professional in his mid-30s detained foreconomic crimes, said it was common for detainees to be subjected to solitaryconfinement:Many people have been locked in these small cells. Thosewho were loud, noisy, or crazy were locked up on their own between one and twoweeks [at a time].[159]The cells are often small, dark rooms that can barelyaccommodate one person. Guangzhou lawyer Chen Le told Human Rights Watch:My client talked about solitary confinement … it issmall and dark in there, and you can’t even stand up straight.[160]Former detainee Tong Shenmu said:The small cell is similar to the [general] big cell. Theyjust partition the general cell into smaller 5-meter-square cells, each withsoft pads on all four sides.[161]Shandong-based lawyer Hua Shengyu said a number of hisclients were detained in these “small cells” and described theconditions there:[They are] detained in a very small room without sunlightor windows…they can barely lie down…in ordinary criminal cases[they are held in solitary confinement] because of their “badattitude” or because they beat fellow detainees in the cell. It is tomake them compliant again.[162]Former detainee Li Fang described her experience in thecell:I was shackled to an iron chair, the so-called tiger chair.The room was about 4 square meters. I was there for one day and one night …there was no window in the room, I was totally alone.[163]Detainees told Human Rights Watch that these punishments areimposed in an arbitrary manner. Lawyers noted that there is no formal way toeffectively challenge these disciplinary actions. Detainee Li Fang told HumanRights Watch that few dare to challenge the guards on their arbitrarypunishment:There is no legal basis for any of these punishments, thereis no standard procedure. They can ask you to do anything, and youwouldn’t dare to disobey.[164]Deaths in Custody[T]here are three most common causes of unnatural deaths[in detention]: First, forced confessions through torture…. The second isviolence against the suspect inside detention centers as [police] try to solvethe case.… The third is giving management power to cell bosses. —Former Director of theMinistry of Public Security’s Bureau of Detention Administration, in amedia interview, Beijing, June 10, 2010[165]While Chinese regulations outline a set of procedures forhandling deaths in custody—including viewing the detention center’ssurveillance video, questioning fellow detainees, doctors, and guards, and anoptional autopsy—how authorities actually handle deaths in custodyappears to vary considerably.Human Rights Watch interviewed family members of fourdetainees who had died in custody and all said they were told by the policethat their family members had died of “natural causes”; in mostcases, it was unclear to them whether investigations had been conducted.Bai Qingzuo, father of a 17-year-old who died days after amonth in custody in a detention center in northwestern China, said theauthorities did not conduct an investigation into his son’s death:There was no investigation.... They said he died fromtuberculosis, a natural cause. They didn't give me any explanation, they justtold me to settle the matter privately with compensation.[166]In Bai’s son’s case, police appear to haverelied on a common tactic: releasing a fatally ill prisoner on medical bail,which relieves the police of responsibilities as outlined in the relevantregulations to conduct an investigation or notify their superiors about a deathin custody. While Bai’s son died in a hospital outside the detentioncenter, there is strong evidence, described below, that authorities hadneglected his condition until it was too late.Jiang Yiguo, the daughter of a detainee in her 60s, said itwas unclear if the police conducted an investigation into her mother’sdeath:I don't know if they have done any investigation. [I onlyread in] the forensics report [which they gave us] that the forensic examinerasked the detention center doctor a few questions out of formality.[167]Ao Ming, the son of a detainee in his late 60s told HumanRights Watch that he was kept in the dark by the police about hisfather’s death:What investigation? They didn’t investigate!... Theydidn’t give us any information, just told us to sign to approve for hiscremation.[168]When families asked to see the standard surveillance videomeant to be taken of all detainees in their living quarters, police did notallow them to watch all the surveillance footage. Jiang Yiguo told Human RightsWatch:They only let us watch the beginning and the end of thesurveillance video in the detention center, and didn't show us the middle. Theysaid that they have regulations and we are not allowed to see the whole video.[169]Ao Ming said:They let us watch the surveillance video of the 30 minutesbefore he died. I saw that he couldn’t walk properly. I told the policethat I want to see more video footage, but they said I could only view themupon application. But they said family members cannot make that application,only our lawyers can. But the police threatened our lawyer [and he then quit],so how were we supposed to make an application [to see the video]?[170]Xiao Li, daughter of a detainee in his 40s, told HumanRights Watch that the detention center showed her a video of her father, whichshowed signs of abuse by a fellow detainee suspected to be a cell boss, but itrefused to give her footage of the area where he was beaten:At the beginning they said there was no camera in thatarea. But eventually we went into the detention center, we saw … thatthere was a camera there but it had been ripped out, and a smaller one thatwould have monitored my father. I found the camera but they wouldn't show usthe videos. After we pointed that out, they changed their words and said,“That's right, we didn't save the videos [you want].”[171]All of the families told Human Rights Watch that authoritiesconducted autopsies on the bodies either on the authorities’ owninitiative or following the families’ requests, but two families saidthey had been reluctant to authorize autopsies because they distrusted thepolice to conduct them impartially.Forensic experts are controlled by the state and they haveto be registered and managed by the Ministry of Justice, but the PublicSecurity Bureaus have their own forensic department and experts.[172]In cases of deaths in custody, according to the relevant regulations, thepolice and the procuratorate can order autopsies from these experts.[173]Families should be consulted in this process, and if they wish to seek forensicexperts other than those chosen by the police or the procuratorate, theauthorities “should allow” them.[174]However, Ao Ming told Human Rights Watch that they were not allowed to useforensic experts other than those appointed by the police:It was the police who found the forensic specialists. Wewanted to find one ourselves, but they wouldn’t let us. They said becauseit happened in the detention center, you can’t apply for the forensicexamination yourself. If they didn’t let us how do we have the power toget another forensic examination? We wanted to find a university in theneighboring province to do the autopsy, but [the police] said no. They saidthey have to arrange this, and that it must be [done locally]. We didn’thave any choice.[175]Xiao Li also said they fought with the police about havingan autopsy done, but failed:We applied to the local procuratorate to have the autopsydone at a medical university in the provincial capital. But the procuratoratereplied that the application was not accepted and we had to apply directly tothe university. So we did, but we were then told that relatives were notallowed to apply directly on their own. The university said only the PublicSecurity Bureau or the procuratorate can make the application to conduct theautopsy.[176]Because families cannot choose who conducts the autopsies,some want to videotape the autopsy so they can send it to other experts. Therelevant Chinese regulations say families can be present at the autopsy, butare silent on whether they can document them.[177]Two family members told Human Rights Watch that police refused their request toobtain photos or videos of the autopsy.Bai Qingzuo said he was reluctant to agree to an autopsy,which was carried out by forensic experts employed in a local university andappointed by the police. He eventually relented, but on the condition that hebe given a video of the autopsy. They did not give it to him:I told them we have two conditions. First, there must be avideo. Second, they have to examine his external wounds.... The report [thatcame out] said all the organs were fine but they didn’t mention thewounds.… They also didn’t give me a copy of the video.[178]Similarly, police showed Xiao Lia copy of the autopsy video and pictures, but did not allow her to make copiesof them:The end [of the autopsy report] said over 50 photos wereattached, so we asked the Public Security Bureau for the photos. The Bureausaid the photos were with the procuratorate, but the procuratorate said thepolice had the photos. They went back and forth like that. Then the politicaland legal committee at the Bureau said, fine, they would let us see thepictures, but we could only view them within their sight. They didn't letrelatives in to watch the autopsy performed and only showed us the autopsyvideo. But they didn't allow us get a copy of the video either.[179]Because family members cannot obtain this kind ofinformation or evidence, it is virtually impossible for them to press forredress, including criminal prosecution of the police officers believedresponsible for the deaths. Under relevant laws and regulations, police can beheld criminally or financially responsible if detainees die as a result of physicalviolence in detention.[180]A detention center told Xiao Li that her father had died ofa sudden heart attack, even though there was evidence of physical violence:In the surveillance video [shown to me], I saw a detaineewho looked like a cell boss pulling my dad off his bed and out to the yard,where I think he beat my father.... Afterwards the video showed that my fatherkept touching one side of his head and seemed to be unwell…. When I sawhis body afterwards, [the morgue] already had dressed him and put make-up on.So I did not see any blood, but I could feel that one side of his skull hadgone soft.[181]In two other cases, police denied any responsibility eventhough there were signs of neglect and denial of adequate medical attentionwhile in detention. Bai Qingzuo said his son suffered for days fromincreasingly itchy, painful red patches on the legs and face, but the detentioncenter did not attend to him or send him to the hospital until just before hisdeath. They released him after they sent him to the hospital, where he diedonly a few days afterwards:They didn't treat him the whole time. When I brought him tothe hospital, I even called the doctor at the detention center and asked him ifhe'd given him any medicine. The doctor said no, that all he had gotten weresome anti-inflammatory drugs.[182]After Bai’s son’s death, the police said that hehad died of tuberculosis. However, neither the police nor the procuratorateinitiated an investigation, and that since his son “died from natural causes,”they said they were “not liable for the death.”“Abnormal deaths” in custody, such as whensuspects die after beatings by fellow detainees, have been at the center ofmedia attention in China. It is difficult to ascertain how many deaths like thesetake place each year, as the MPS is the only agency that publishes statistics. In2009, official data noted only 15 cases of deaths in custody due to“unnatural causes,” and subsequent reports by the MPS state thatboth the numbers of unnatural and “natural” deaths droppedconsecutively in 2010 and 2011.[183]The MPS claims that deaths in detention centers dropped to a historical low in2013.[184]A RecentPress Report of a Suspicious Death While in CustodyPressreports of suspicious deaths while in custody continue to be publishedregularly in recent years.[185]The case below, which alleges theinvolvement of cell bosses, is taken from Chinese press accounts.InDecember 2013, Mo Youwen, 38, was taken into custody for allegations of theftto a county detention center in Guangxi, where he died 39 days later.Initially, the local Public Security Bureau and doctors at the hospital whohad treated Mo insisted that he had died of “a sudden illness”:leukemia. Yet Mo’s family saw his body and said it was covered withinjuries and bruises. The police offered the family 900,000 RMB (aboutUS$150,000) as compensation on the condition that the family not publiclydiscuss the case.[186]The family’s suspicions ofill-treatment grew when they saw the hospital records, which noted externalinjuries.The BeijingYouth Daily quoted anonymous sources saying that Mo died after beingbeaten by cell bosses for more than two weeks, all within view of thewatchful surveillance camera in the cells. It was not the first time Mo wasbadly beaten either—earlier, he had been transferred out of his firstcell after he was beaten by other detainees, and it was in this second cellthat he was beaten to death. Ironically, the procuratorial office of thedetention center in which Mo died was given awards by the SPP in 2007 and in2011 for its excellence in ensuring a safe detention environment.[187]After the press reports, the localprocuratorate promised to investigate the case, but at this writing, theresults of this investigation have not been made public and there is nopublicly available evidence that anyone has been held accountable.[188]III. Access to Lawyers,Relatives, and Medical CarePrompt access to independent lawyers and doctors, as well asthe right to be visited by or correspond with family members, are basic rightsof detainees and are critical to the prevention of torture and ill-treatment.In general, detainees should have the rights to legal counsel of their ownchoosing, to “prompt access” to an independent physician, and to beable to communicate with family members, including through visits, subject onlyto restrictions and supervision necessary to the security and order of thefacility.[189]These rights are often deniedin China. Under Chinese law, suspects have no right to have lawyers presentwhile they are interrogated in police stations and detention centers.[190] Suspects are not guaranteed the right againstself-incrimination (being allowed to remain silent during interrogations).[191] They can appoint and meet with lawyers, but thepractical bars to hiring effective counsel are considerable and free legalcounsel is not guaranteed.[192] In addition, police are legally entitled to denyaccess to lawyers to suspects charged with terrorism, major corruption crimes, andstate security offenses.[193] Detainees also have no access to medical professionals independent from the police, and veryrestricted or no communication with their families, creating conditions thatare conducive to the use of torture.[194]Safeguards introduced in recent years, including the video recordingof criminal interrogations and mandatory physical examination upon arrival atthe detention center, could prevent torture if effectively implemented. Butthey have had a limited impact because they rely on the state to restrain andpolice itself. While the “exclusionary rule”—the exclusionfrom trial of statements obtained through torture—which should providelawyers opportunities to challenge such evidence in criminal proceedings, hasproven to be too weak a tool.Access to LawyersAcademic and official sourcesestimate that 70 to 90 percent of criminal defendants in China have no lawyers,typically because defendants are often too poor to hire them or are discouragedfrom doing so by the police.[195]Legal representation and legal aid are compulsory forthose accused of crimes that might lead to life imprisonment or the deathpenalty, or to juvenile suspects and those with disabilities.[196]While others can apply for legal aid, such assistanceis not guaranteed, as required by international law.[197]In a positive move, the Chinese government haspiloted a “duty lawyer” system in some detention centers since 2006to improve legal access, though it is unclear if and when the scheme will beadopted nationally.[198]For the minority ofdefendants who can afford lawyers, the next hurdle is being able to contact alawyer to request legal representation while in police custody. Under theCriminal Procedure Law, suspects have the right to appoint lawyers as soon asthey are first interrogated or held under any of the compulsory measures of thepolice (summons, bail pending trial, residential surveillance, detention, orarrest).[199]Police should then convey this request to the lawyer“in a timely manner.”[200]Former detainees and defenselawyers Human Rights Watch spoke with, however, said that police often fail topass on these requests and, in two cases we examined, suspects said theysuffered retaliation for making them.Cao Zuowei, a worker accusedof theft, said police ignored him when he said he wanted to hire a lawyer:I said I wanted to hire a lawyer to sue you. They said,“Hire a lawyer? You think this is Hong Kong? This is the US?… Ifyou don’t obey I’ll make you obey.” As he was saying this hewas kicking and hitting me.[201]Beijing-based lawyer LuQinghua said that in a case he handled, police started beating his client when theclient asked for a lawyer:He saw the rights of suspects [pre-printed] on the police recordof his statement. So when he saw them he asked to hire a lawyer. Just becauseof this request, the police started beating him, slapping and kicking him.After beating him for a while, they handcuffed him onto the window frame, hisfeet barely touching the ground for almost an hour, his hands turned black andthat is when he “confessed.”[202]Defense lawyers told HumanRights Watch that access to non-political criminal suspects improved afterrevisions to the Criminal Procedure Law in 2012. Under the revisions, lawyershave access to suspects upon presentation of “threedocuments”—their lawyer’s license, a letter authorizingthem to represent the suspect, and a letter fromtheir law firm.[203] But lawyers have also complained about long waitingtimes because of a shortage of meeting rooms for lawyers, additionalrequirements for documents not required by the law, excuses by the police thatpresiding officers must be present, and other obstacles to meeting theirclients in some detention centers.[204]Pursuant to the 2012 revisions,moreover, those charged with terrorism, state security crimes, and majorcorruption charges (involving over 500,000 RMB [$82,000] in bribes), cannotmeet with lawyers without police approval.[205]These same suspects can also be held in a secretlocation outside of official detention centers for up to six months, creatingconditions rife for torture and ill-treatment.[206]Lawyers have also complained that the authoritieshave abused this exception to legal access even when it is not clear that thecase falls into one of the three categories. According to a state press report:Beijing lawyer Gong Zhifang handled a case involving“unlawful transfer and sale of land use rights”… until theclient was released on bail, Gong was unable to meet her. The detention center’sreason was, “we were notified by the investigative unit, that this casebelongs to ‘the three categories.’” But [the authorities]never said which of the three categories of crimes the case falls under.[207]Officials charged with corruption are often denied access tolawyers even though the total amount involved is well below the threshold thatwould qualify the case as one involving “major corruption.”[208]In a survey cited in the official press, only 30 percent of corruption suspectsare allowed legal access.[209]In one 2013 case, for example:[L]awyer Wang Yalin accepted the bribery case against theacting director of the bidding office of Wuhu County. His client was anassistant section chief, and was suspected of having received bribes of over100,000RMB [$15,900], but because it was considered to have a significantimpact in his area, it was listed as a “major corruption case.”[210]A number of detainees who hadaccess to lawyers told Human Rights Watch that the lawyers they hired refuse totake cases involving police abuse or failed to advocate on behalf of theirclients due to police pressure. Bai Qingzuo told Human Rights Watch:I went to hire lawyers, but as soon as they heard that mycase involves death in custody, and that it involves the police, no one daredto take it.[211]Another family member of a victim, Yang Jinli, said she alsohad a hard time finding lawyers who dared to challenge the police:The lawyer we hired for the first instance trial was alocal lawyer, he was not brave enough to take on the authorities. We let him goin the end, because we found him problematic. We changed lawyers, but this onewas the same, he didn’t dare to fight for the rights of the defendant.[212]Ao Ming, son of a detainee who died in custody, told HumanRights Watch:We hired a lawyer at the time.…The PSB threatened him and said “If you don’t back off from thiscase, you won’t ever be allowed to do your business here.”[213]A lawyer explained why fellow lawyers are afraid of confrontingthe authorities on police abuse:It depends on the lawyers—many don’t dare torepresent clients who file [torture] complaints. Because this can offend theauthorities, and if you offend them, and afterwards you need their help in yourwork, what are you going to do? Beggars can’t be choosers.[214]In addition to fears of offending the authorities, there arealso legal consequences for lawyers challenging the police on torture. Article306 of the Criminal Law penalizes lawyers who “entice” suspects to“falsify evidence” or “change their testimony contrary tofacts.”[215]The widely reported case of Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned for helpinghis client to speak out about torture, reportedly has deterred many criminallawyers from taking such cases.[216]Access to FamilyMembersThe police are required to notify family members within 24hours of criminal detention, residential surveillance, or formal arrest.[217]Access to families is critical: often it is a detainee’s only means ofhiring a lawyer, and for those who do not have lawyers it is the only way ofalerting people outside the detention center that they are being mistreated. Accordingto the law, suspects can meet with their families in the presence of policeofficers after they obtain permission from the police.[218]But in practice, detention centers severely restrict suspects’communication with their families. Academics and lawyers report that detentioncenters do not allow suspects to meet with family members until they areconvicted and either choose not to pursue appeals or have exhausted the appealsprocess.[219] Detentioncenters typically do not allow suspects to call their families, according tointerviewees.Several suspects told HumanRights Watch that the police failed to notify their families of their detentionor notified them days after they were first taken into custody.[220] Yu Zhenglu said police did not notify hisfamily at all when he was in detention for 20 days:No, after I came out I asked my family, they didn’teven know where I’d gone. It was like I just disappeared into thin air.[221]Chen Zhongshen told Human Rights Watch that police did notnotify his family for the entire month he spent in custody:My family did not receive any [notice], the detentioncenter didn’t contact my family, they didn’t even let them sendclothes to me. My family [learned about my detention] after other suspects whowere released went and told them.[222]Often the only way to reach one’sfamily is through letters, but guards or cell bosses at detention centers oftenintercept letters, exposing mistreatment in detention. Zuo Yi told HumanRights Watch that his letters never reached his family:I could hire lawyers, but I couldn’t send any lettersout. This is because the letters have to go through the cell bosses to theguards. My letters didn’t go through. I suspect they were never sent,because after I was released, [my family] told me they didn’t receiveany.[223]Li Fang, who was held in Shanghai, told Human Rights Watchthat she was unable to write or otherwise communicate with her family:I have never contacted my family. They didn’t allowfamily visits, and they didn’t let us write letters. A few people canwrite to their families—if they admit their guilt then the guards letthem write. They can write once every month. You can’t use the phone.[224]Xiao Li said she had no direct contact with her father, wholater died in custody, making it very difficult for her to find out whathappened to him in detention, and whether he may have been abused:I couldn’t contact him, they wouldn’t let usmeet him…no phone calls either. After he was sentenced, I went and lookedfor people who worked in the detention center, asking them if I can call myfather or visit him, but they didn’t let us. We couldn’t writeletters to him either … earlier I wrote him a letter but it wasn’tgiven to him.[225]Access to AdequateMedical TreatmentDetainees have rights to independent medical examinationsupon detention and upon request, according to international standards; theseare key safeguards against torture and mistreatment.[226] In China, detention centers are required toallow medical workers to give detainees a physical check-up before admittingthem to the facilities, as well as before their departure, and Chineseregulations allow ill or injured suspects in detention access to medicaltreatment.[227]Through these interactions with medical workers during their detention,suspects should be offered a degree of protection from abuse.The purpose of the initial exam, according to theregulations, is to screen out from detention centers detainees who havepsychosocial disabilities, infectious diseases, those who are pregnant orbreastfeeding, those who are too ill or too old, those who are injured or whosedisabilities make them unable to care for themselves, and those whose continueddetention can endanger their lives.[228]The regulations do not require doctors to check for signs of torture and abuse,but the examination should provide an opportunity for doctors to note suchsigns.In practice, however, former detainees and defense lawyerstold Human Rights Watch that medical workers—whether at hospitals or atthe detention centers—do not ask suspects about obvious evidence ofphysical abuse and the presence of police at the examinations makes itdifficult for suspects themselves to raise the subject with medical workers.Gu Daoying told Human Rights Watch that the doctor ignoredhis injuries:At the time I had a few small injuries from the electricbatons but [the doctor] made no record of them, of course he saw them. [Thedoctors] all belong to the police system. I was scared when I got sent there soI didn’t say anything [about torture].[229]Shanghai-based lawyer Yu Zheng told Human Rights Watch:Detention centers are guarded by the police themselves. Ifsomeone has visible injuries, they will go away in a few days, unless it ismore serious and [detainees] have to be taken to the hospital, but even in thiscase they would not write it down [in the physical record].[230]Lawyers told Human Rights Watch that police officersguarding the detention centers are often wary of receiving suspects who aremore seriously injured or ill, possibly for fear that they might die in thosefacilities and thus bear responsibility for their treatment. But those who havebeen tortured are sometimes admitted. Beijing-based lawyer Luo Chenghu toldHuman Rights Watch that after the investigative police had a discussion withthe police responsible for the detention of his client, the detention centeradmitted the client even though he had injuries from torture:My clients told me that the detention center [guards] asked[the investigative police], “What do we do about these injuries?”But because they are all police, they didn’t record anything beforeadmitting him to the detention center.[231]Suspects are reluctant totell medical workers about torture because they do not consider that theworkers independent of the police. The medical workers are either stationed inthe detention center, in which case they are MPS employees or police officers, or,increasingly, they are doctors in designated local hospitals that often havecontractual or close relationships with the detention center.[232]A number ofsuspects said police officers were standing right next to them while they wereundergoing the physical check-up, such that if suspects chose to raise theirabuse with the doctor they would simultaneously be challenging the police.Ma Yingying, a former detainee who was subjected to days inthe “tiger chair” and sleep deprivation told Human Rights Watch:“The police were always around, you can’t talk. Talk to the doctor?No way, you get beaten if you talk.”[233]Another former detainee told Human Rights Watch:There was a physical exam at the county hospital. Theychecked my blood pressure, did some blood tests, and so on. The police officerwas right next to the doctors. What use is there to tell [the doctor about thetorture]? The doctors don’t care.[234]Some lawyers we interviewed said that their clients wereforced by the investigating officers to say that their injuries wereself-inflicted. Shen Mingde, a lawyer based in Beijing, said:For example in this one case in Guizhou, the person wasbeaten so badly that he couldn’t stand up … [the police] made thedefendant say that he injured himself … and later, during the [court]procedure [examining the need to] exclude illegal evidence, [the procuratorate]presented health records that stated that he was not injured.[235]Detainees also told Human Rights Watch of their suspicion thatinvestigative police officers pressure medical staff to change their medicalevaluations so that detainees pass the test and are admitted into detentioncenters. Chen Zhongshen, who was subjected to the “tiger chair” for47 hours and who is in poor health, told Human Rights Watch:They measured my blood pressure, and found that it was veryhigh, but when the police officer saw it he pulled the doctor aside, [Idon’t know] what he said, I couldn’t hear it. When the doctor cameback, he did it again, and the result was that my blood pressure was not veryhigh, and it wasn’t too low, so I passed the physical. Later, in thedetention center there was another check-up, and my blood pressure was 220.​The director shouted at the doctors: why didn’t you find that out?What if he died?[236]Defense lawyers told HumanRights Watch that detainees’ medical reports, which could give cluesabout abuses and trigger legal protections, are often not included in casefiles. Consequently the report is not available to the procurator, judge, ordefense lawyers for examination. Lawyers can ask the judge to request therecords, but such requests might not be granted. Shanghai-based lawyer SongSanzuo said:Usually there is no health exam report, you can’t getyour hands on it. Only when the judge asks for it then you can see it, butoften the judges don’t.[237]Beijing-based lawyer Ze Zhongsaid:There are physical check-ups, but the records aren’tincluded in the case file. The lawyers can’t see it, the judgescan’t see it, and the procuratorate doesn’t ask for it … mostof the time the judges won’t … request it.[238]Beijing-based lawyer Xiao Guosheng, who has over 10 years ofexperience as a criminal defense lawyer, recalled that in one case the judge specificallyrequested the medical report but the police refused to hand it over:Even the judge went there himself, but the police refusedto provide it. He said we need to talk to the police chief and only after hesigned for it, then they can provide it.… We went to the detention centerto request the document, but they told us that the file was gone, itcouldn’t be found, and so they didn’t give it to us.[239]When the police officers handover a medical report to the court, it is not necessarily useful. Lawyer YuZheng told Human Rights Watch that the health records do not truthfully recordthe physical state of the suspects at admission: “Even if you areinjured, they will either say it is self-inflicted or leave it blank.”[240]Lawyer Ze Zhong noted the same problem:Even if there was serious torture, how do the police solvethis problem? They make the police guards write something saying the defendanthurt himself or it was an accident. When you ask, the procuratorate pushes [theresponsibility] to the police, and the police respond with a statement [assertingthere was no torture].[241]A number of former detainees said medical care provided bythe detention centers is rudimentary at best, while two relatives of detaineesalleged that their family members died after a combination of prolonged neglectand denial of medical care in detention (see “Deaths in Custody,”above). The problem of inadequate health care is also exemplified by cases ofactivists who died or became very ill in detention. The most prominent case wasthe death of activist Cao Shunli in March 2014, who died after the authoritieshad denied her access to adequate health care for several months while she wasseriously ill in detention.[242]Official reports have acknowledged that medical care in manydetention centers is still inadequate, despite new official measures to improveits standards such as the engagement of local hospitals’ medicalservices.[243]In a review of medical care provision in one Guangzhou detention center, aprocuratorate staff member wrote that it lacked “qualified medicalstaff” and staff with “the ability to treat detainees.”[244]If detainees are seriouslyill, detention centers are supposed to send them to outside hospitalsdesignated by the detention center.[245]But two former detainees told Human Rights Watch thatthey knew of instances where detention center staff refused to let detainees goto hospitals outside the detention center. Li Fang recalled one incident when afellow detainee seemed seriously ill but was not sent to the hospital:There was one detainee, she fainted. At the beginning theythought she was pretending [to be ill], but later they let her sleep during theday … but they didn’t let her go to the hospital.[246]Feng Kun told Human RightsWatch that in a detention center in Henan Province:Only if you are very seriously ill can you see a doctor.…There was one detainee who was in so much pain he couldn’t stand it, hetried to kill himself by hitting his head against the wall. Only then did theysend him to the hospital.[247]IV. Protection fromAbuseIn recent years the Chinese government has adopted measures—includingthe video recording of interrogations and the use of iron bars to separatesuspects and police officers—to reduce torture and ill-treatment ofdetainees. While this has likely had a positive impact in some places, there isalso evidence police have adapted by evading the new measures.Video RecordingThe Chinese government and Chinese legal scholars highlightthe 2010 requirement to video record criminal interrogations as one of the mostpromising means of preventing torture during criminal interrogations.[248]Legal scholars who had studied torture prevention in other countries wereleading proponents of the measure, and the procuratorate introduced thepractice to cut down on abuses.[249]According to the Criminal Procedure Law, interrogations ofsuspects who might be sentenced to death or life imprisonment and “othermajor crimes” must be videotaped.[250]The Ministry of Public Security further defines “other majorcrimes” as those that cause “serious injury or death,” “endangerpublic safety,” or “seriously violate citizens’ personalrights,” as well as triad-related crimes and serious drug-related crimes.[251]The videotaping should be a “complete”[252]recording of each interrogation, and should not be edited.[253]Most interrogation rooms in detention centers and police stations are outfittedwith video equipment.[254]The Criminal Procedure Law only statesthat police “can” videotape interrogations of other crimes; thereis no requirement to do so.[255]Two of the former detainees we spoke with fell within thevideotaping rule, but their interrogations were not videotaped. In both cases,the interrogations took place outside the detention center, where there were nocapabilities for videotaping. In other cases, where videotaping is optional, formerdetainees told Human Rights Watch that their interrogations were not videotapedeither. Yu Zhenglu, accused of economic crimes, told Human Rights Watch:They didn't follow the regular procedure of taking me tothe detention center, they didn’t videotape [the interrogation] either.[256]Similarly, Gu Daoying, detained for alleged gambling, saidhe was not videotaped:They beat me in the [public security] office! According tothe law, [videotaping] should take place in the interrogation room. Since weweren’t in the interrogation room, there was no videotaping.[257]Lawyer Shen Mingde said the selective videotaping ofinterrogations render the requirement meaningless:They videotape the confessions selectively … then itis meaningless … there was no recording when they took him out [of thedetention center].[258]A few lawyers said police officers often first torture orabuse the suspects, then videotape the confession. Xie Yongping, who iscurrently in detention, told his lawyer what happened after he was beaten:The four officers came in … and they input theprepared materials in the computer. One officer asked me to read aloud thematerials on the computer screen … one operated the computer, and afemale officer videotaped the process. It was in this way, on the verge of amental breakdown, that I coordinated with them to create the evidence theyneeded.[259]Lawyer Lu Qinghua said:Interrogation rooms in police stations have surveillancecameras, but not all of them. They first bring people to the rooms withoutcameras, and after they confess, they’d bring them to rooms withvideotaping equipment.[260]A procurator from Tianjin municipality acknowledged thatvideotaping does not necessarily solve the problem of torture at the hands ofthe police:Even if interrogations are videotaped, it doesn’tmean there won’t be forced confessions through torture. This is becausethere are many ways to bypass the regulation, such as beating the defendantinto submission before videotaping. [261]In addition, suspects and lawyers say that the fullinterrogation video is often not presented in court. Lawyer Luo Chenghu said:We asked for the videotapes in court. He was videotaped 10times, but they showed only three or four of the [clips] … each [clip]was incomplete.[262]In another case, the procurator tried to make the case thatthe suspect had not been beaten by showing only parts of the interrogationwithout such abuse. The detainee’s sister told Human Rights Watch:The procurator … said [to my brother], “Didthey beat you in this video?” My brother said, “Why you don’tshow the video of when I was beaten?” [The procurator], “But theydidn’t beat you at this time [of the video], right?”[263]Chen Yongsheng, an expert in criminal procedure law inBeijing University, believes that selectively presenting videotapes that do notdepict abuses is common.[264]He wrote:Currently, the People’s procuratorate usually onlysends one video segment to the court per case … generally [theprocuratorate] picks the segment with the most rule-abiding [conduct].A former judge also expressed skepticism about partialvideotapes of interrogations:If the video shows the interrogation between 3 and 3:30,you still don’t know what happened before then. You are doubtful, youwonder if they have been rehearsed.[265]Selective videotaping and excerpting of videotapes in court canhave a negative impact. Chen Ruchao, a criminal justice scholar at SouthwestUniversity of Political Science and Law, wrote in 2014:When the prosecution selectively plays the video clips incourt … not only does this fail to curb coerced confession, the selectedcontent becomes the best evidence to prove that the suspect made the confessionvoluntarily, and it becomes an amulet for the investigators who had tortured.[266]This echoes some of the court verdicts that citedefendants’ “serenity” in video recordings as evidence thatthe alleged torture did not take place:According to the court’s investigation, thesimultaneous video recording shows that defendant Deng Yong-ping spoke at anormal pace, looked calm and gave a natural, coherent confession. Therefore, itcan be concluded that Deng confessed voluntarily and there is no sign of forcedconfession through the use of torture.[267]Lawyers also told us that in some cases police refused tohand over videos, edited them before releasing them, or “lost” them.Lawyer Chen Lihua, who has worked for nearly two decades as a criminal defenselawyer, told Human Rights Watch:In theory, yes [there is the videotape], but [the police] canrefuse to hand it over, or only submit it after editing the footage.[268]Former detainee Ma Yingying, whose interrogation was notvideotaped even though her case falls under the rule, said police made upexcuses when she and other defendants asked that videotapes of theirinterrogations be shown in court:We requested [that the videotape be shown], he said thecamera was broken, and [even if there was a tape] it would be stored for only20 days.[269]Under Chinese law, the defense has no power to compel thepolice or the procuratorate to give them access to videotapes or have themshown in court.[270]The lawyers can ask the court to make a request for this evidence, but in somecases, judges also are unwilling to compel the police to present videos or challengeor investigate police claims that videotapes are unavailable. Lawyer Zhang Leinoted that in one case:The court responded to our request for the interrogationvideotape [by saying it had] requested it from the detention center, but thedetention center issued a statement explaining that the videotapes were onlykept for 15 days. [The court accepted at face value the claim that] thevideotape requested by the defense was no longer available.[271]How Police Thwart LegalProtections against Torture and Ill-treatmentLawyers told Human Rights Watch that some police have foundways to sidestep protections against torture and ill-treatment, including byinterrogating suspects before they are taken to official detention centers orby removing suspects from them. Indeed, all but one of the detainees we interviewedfor this report said the alleged mistreatment took place outside of officialdetention centers. Shenzhen-based lawyer Zha Guliang told Human Rights Watch:After the detention centers were upgraded, interrogatorsand suspects were separated by an iron fence, so generally speaking, torturecannot happen. That means coerced confessions usually happen within 48 hours,before the police send you to detention centers.[272]Lawyer Xiao Guosheng said that coerced confessions “donot happen at detention centers, where … our country has a rathercomprehensive monitoring system. So if you conduct interrogation in there, itwould be difficult to torture to extract confession under surveillance.”[273]Procurator Wu Yanwu acknowledged the problem in an article:“The period between when suspects are apprehended and when they are takento a detention center is a period with high incidence of torture.”[274]Police often hold suspects in the office of the police responsiblefor criminal investigations (xingjing dadui, 刑警大队, or zhenchadadui,侦查大队),which might be in the same compound as the detention center. Suspects aresometimes also held in police stations (paichusuo 派出所), hostels, and otherpolice-controlled facilities such as drug rehabilitation centers. Most of thesefacilities, unlike detention centers, are not equipped with the infrastructuredesigned to prevent torture during police interrogations. Lawyer Lu Qinghuatold Human Rights Watch:Usually, coerced confessions take place when they takesuspects out of detention centers, like in certain rooms in police stations orin the offices of public security bureaus.[275]Chinese criminal law requires suspects to be transferred toa detention center within 24 hours after they are put under formal detention. However,suspects can be held in police custody for many hours before they are put underformal detention. Police can delay formal detention in various ways, includingby issuing a chuanhuan (传唤),a form of non-coercive summons under the Criminal Procedure Law thateffectively allows the police to hold suspects for an additional 24 hours, andthrough a form of administrative detention known as liuzhi pancha (留置盘查)[276]under the Police Law that allows police to hold suspects for another 48 hours.Lawyer Yu Zheng told Human Rights Watch just how flexible the law is regardingthis period:It doesn’t matter if [the police] summoned you ornot, or perhaps it was an unofficial summons. The police hold great power inour country.… The police can also hold you for investigation [liuzhipancha], or keep you as a witness without a deadline. We saw a case likethis in Guangzhou—they first questioned someone as a witness for daysuntil the person couldn’t take it anymore, then they issued a summons. Becausepolice power has no restrictions, they have many ways to go about this.[277]Regardless of the procedures applied, lawyer Ze Zhong toldHuman Rights Watch that police sometimes do not actually follow them:Usually it [forced confession] happens prior to [being sentto] detention centers, the length of detention varies. I have someone who wasnot sent to the detention center for three days … according toprocedures, suspects should be taken to a detention center within 24 hours[after formal detention], but sometimes the procedures aren’t followed.[278]Former detainee Lei Xinmu said he was not transferred to adetention center until days after the legal limit:I was sitting on a “tiger chair,” and therewere two spotlights aimed on my head. They took turns to talk to me….They would not let me rest, I couldn’t take it any longer…. I wastaken to the detention center only after 9 days and 9 nights.[279]Police can also falsify the records so that it appears allhas been done according to procedures. Lawyer Chen Ao said:[The police] put [the suspect] in a hostel … andlater they forged the documents saying he was taken to the detention center.[280]Under the Criminal ProcedureLaw, once a suspect is detained in an official detention center, he orshe can only be interrogated in the center.[281]But criminal investigators have used various methods to circumvent thisrequirement, for example by transferring suspects between detention centers andusing the time between for torture, or by taking suspects out of detentioncenters to purportedly “identify the crime scene.” Chinese laws andregulations have no rules regarding the former and allow police to do thelatter “when necessary.”[282]There are few requirements for taking suspects to “identify the crimescene” except that at least two police officers be present and that the officersfirst obtain permission from their superiors.[283]The law also does not mandate that defense counsel be present when suspects aretaken out to identify crime scenes.Lawyer Xiao Guosheng told Human Rights Watch that suspectsare often taken out of detention centers and then forced to confess:The way they do it is to take suspects to “identifythe scene,” a procedure stated in the Criminal Procedure Law.… Thisprocess requires approval by the deputy police chief in charge of investigations.But they don’t take the defendant to identify anything; he is taken tothe investigation office where there is no surveillance equipment and it ishere that they coerce the suspect to confess.[284]Lawyer Wu Ying told Human Rights Watch that where he washeld in a detention center, there was widespread fear among fellow detaineesabout being taken out and tortured:Taking the defendant out is the main method [of coercingconfessions]. Everyone gets very scared when they know it’s their turn tobe “taken out.” They said they had to wear helmets as well ashandcuffs and leg irons [out there]. I wondered, why the helmets? They said it wasto prevent them from committing suicide.[285]There are official acknowledgments that police takeadvantage of this legal loophole. A vice chief procurator responsible foroverseeing detention facilities in Zhejiang Province wrote:In investigative work, it is a practical necessity to takesuspects out of detention centers after they have been detained or arrested, inorder to identify the scene, recover stolen goods, or other reasons. But thisalso provides time and conditions for illegal investigative behaviors includingcoerced confessions.[286]The Exclusionary RuleMore and more lawyers have requested the procedure [toexclude illegal evidence], and more and more courts have initiated it, but mostare just going through the motions…. The impact of this procedure is verylimited. In many cases, police write a few words saying the suspect had not beentortured to extract a confession, then [the procedure] is done.—Lawyer Song Sanzuo, Shanghai, May 2014 on theexclusionary ruleChina’s procedure to exclude evidence obtained through“illegal” means in criminal proceedings is a positive step towardspreventing torture and other ill-treatment.[287]According to the rule, the police, the procuratorate, and the court all haveresponsibilities to exclude such evidence if it is found during any phase oflegal proceedings.[288]In theory the procurator has to “investigate andverify the accusations.”[289]Confessions or witness statements obtained illegally should be excluded. Theprocuratorate should seek an explanation from the investigators for documentaryor physical evidence obtained illegally, and exclude such evidence when itcannot be corrected or be given a reasonable explanation.[290]After exclusion, if the remaining evidence cannot prove the crime, then theprocuratorate should either reject the police’s request for arrest orprosecution, or send the case back for supplementary investigation.[291]The procuratorate is also required to initiate a criminalprosecution against the police for any illegal behavior found.[292]Procurators can investigate the claim through questioning suspects, theinvestigators, witnesses, or defense lawyers; obtaining statements, a videorecording of the interrogation, or suspects’ health records in detention;and conducting medical evaluations.[293]Former detainees and defense lawyers told Human Rights Watch,however, that the procedure often does not work as intended. Too often, procuratorsrefuse or fail to follow-up when allegations of torture are made, even thoughthe burden of proving that evidence has been obtained legally falls upon theprocuratorate.Former detainee Gu Daoying said that when he raised theissue of torture, the procurator simply ignored his complaint: “I saw theprocurator during the review stage. I said I was hit with electric batons, buthe didn’t say anything.”[294]Lawyer Lu Qinghua said the procurator in his client’scase was more explicit in refusing to look into the torture allegation: “Myclient told [the procurator] about being tortured to confess, but [the procurator]said, ‘This isn’t my problem.’”[295]Ma Yingying said the procurator responsible for her case didnot intervene even when he witnessed her abuse by the police.Seven or eight police officers accompanied me to [anotherroom in] the detention center, while, another five or six stood behind the procurator.The deposition was prepared in advance and the procurator said: “[Thefacts are] what you said in there.” So I told him what I said in therewas not true. The police officer standing behind me then hit me on thehead…. The procurator didn’t say anything.[296]Some lawyers also told Human Rights Watch that after theyhad written to the procuratorate complaining about torture of their clients,the procuratorate would on some occasions provide a brief written reply simplysaying there was no torture without giving any details. And sometimes suchreplies were not even provided, as lawyer Lu Xiangming noted:Generally speaking there aren’t any [writtenreplies]…. They may give you one, or they may not. If they do reply, theyusually write something like, “After investigations, there does not existthe phenomenon of torture.” That’s it.[297]Lawyer Shen Mingde said:The procuratorate gave no response. We sent a written[complaint] to the public security bureau and there was no response. When theysaw us face to face, they’d say, “We’ll investigate,”but then they didn’t respond. There has never been one case [I have dealtwith or heard of] in which the procuratorate admits to finding torture.[298]Although the procurator never acknowledged the use oftorture, in two cases lawyers managed to have some impact on theprocurators’ handling of the cases. Lawyer Lu Xiangming told Human RightsWatch:[In one case], there were [procedural] flaws and torture. Theprocurator thought we had a point, and so he let [my client] be released onbail. The case stopped at the procuratorate and the evidence didn’t getused [against the defendant].[299]Similarly, lawyer Shen Mingde said:In the case in Jilin, the confession wasn’t clearlyexcluded. The procuratorate just did not present it as prosecution evidence.[300]Defendants and their lawyers can request that the courtinitiate the evidence exclusion procedure either during the trial, or before itstarts, in a pretrial hearing.[301]They first have to provide “relevant clues or materials,”[302]and the court then initiates an investigation, during which the procuratoratehas to provide evidence to prove that the police acted legally.[303]In cases where the evidence does not establish that police acted legally, theprocuratorate can ask the court to have investigators appear in court; thecourt can also ask police to testify directly and police “should”appear in court following the request.[304]If the court concludes that the evidence was obtained illegally, or that itcannot exclude such a possibility, then the evidence should be excluded.[305]Chinese defense lawyers believe this rule should provide atool and platform for them to advocate for their clients who were tortured. Butthey say that in some cases the judges continue to ignore their torture claimswithout explanation. Lawyer Xiao Guosheng said:We asked [the court] to start the procedure to excludeillegal evidence, but the judge didn’t, and he did not say why. So we leftthe court in protest and complained … there was no reaction. [306]Lawyers we interviewed agreed that, in general, the rule hasmade it harder for judges to simply brush off torture allegations, but saidthat judges still do not seem to examine the allegations seriously.Analysis of the SPC Court VerdictDatabaseAs noted above, our search of all Chinese criminal courtverdicts published on the SPC website during the first four months of 2014,some 158,000 in total, turned up 432 verdicts in which suspects alleged policetorture. The defendants were convicted in all 432 cases, and judges excludedconfessions in only 23 cases (6 percent of the verdicts) due to concerns overpolice torture. And even in those 23 cases, the defendants were convicted.Analysis of the 432 verdicts shows that 32 mention suspectsalleged torture and then say nothing further about it. In the remaining 400verdicts, judges address the torture claims at least briefly.In that latter group of 400 verdicts, a majority ofdecisions (247 cases, or 62 percent, see Appendix II, Table II) relied only ondocumentary evidence, which is not unusual given that most trials in China haveno live witnesses.[307]Only 35 of the verdicts (9 percent) mention any live witnesses and in everycase the live witnesses were police officers. There is no sign that defensewitnesses or medical or forensic experts were allowed to testify in relation toa torture claim in any of the cases. In the remaining 118 verdicts (30percent), neither documentary evidence nor witness testimony is mentioned.Further analysis of the verdicts shows the forms ofdocumentary evidence judges most often relied on. They include physicalexamination records (208 cases or 52 percent); written statements by policeofficers who investigated the case or guarded the detention cell (132 cases or33 percent); videotaped recordings of interrogations (97 cases or 24 percent);and, much more rarely, written statements from fellow detainees (9 cases or 2percent). As noted above, however, such documentary evidence is either producedby the police or is highly susceptible to manipulation by the police.Xie Ying, sister of a detainee who was later convicted,criticized the use of police officers’ written statements:I think this is so laughable. You public security peoplebeat and injured our people and then you write something saying youdidn’t beat people up, and the court believes it…. So you killsomeone, and then write something proving you didn’t. Do courts thennecessarily believe you?[308]Guangdong-based lawyer Zhang Rong also said that in thecases he handled the documentary evidence presented by the procurator was notcredible:During the trial, the procurator in court will give a lotof evidence to show that they did not extract a confession through torture.They also pretend not to see the defendant’s bruises … [and] thereis no record of torture in the procuratorate’s physical examinationreports.[309]Many judges seem to be satisfied with documentary evidenceeven when it is inadequate to rule out the possibility of torture. For example,in a case in which a defendant alleged that police tortured him and broke hisleft thumb, the verdict cited a medical record from the detention center thatdid not record any injury as the sole evidence to rule out ill-treatment. Inanother case, the defendant said he had injuries to his right wrist and thigh,but the court cited medical records and statements by detention center guardsstating that his injuries occurred during his arrest.As noted above, in 118 of the 400 verdicts, neither documentaryevidence nor witnesses are mentioned. In some cases, the judges appear to have madetheir decisions based on record as it existed, often ruling out torture withoutany effort to seek evidence corroborating or refuting the claims. The verdictcited below is a typical example:Upon investigation, [the court finds that] defendant WangPengzhang confessed to the main facts of the case during the investigationstage, and that the other defendants’ confessions and witness statementscorroborate Wang Pengzhang’s confession; the facts [establishing] theextortion crime are clear. Wang Pengzhang’s defense that his testimonywas obtained through torture has no basis, and his defense cannot beestablished.[310]Another common reason for rejecting a torture claim is thatthe suspect did not provide the court with “sufficient clues” or“sufficient evidence.” According to the rule, judges can refuse toinitiate the procedure if the defense has not provided “relevantclues.” While a defendant needs to set out a basic allegation of torture,providing some information, the law is unclear as to how much evidence issufficient to warrant an investigation, though it gives examples of the kindsof information needed, such as the time and location of torture.[311]Lawyer Lu Qinghua told Human Rights Watch:The judge said that you didn’t provide obvious cluesto torture, the court will not examine it.... The court’s idea is basedon an outdated way of thinking: the person who alleges it has to provide the evidence.You say you were tortured? What evidence do you have?... At one trial, the defendant... had had his teeth knocked out, and yet the court did not start theprocedure.[312]The exclusionary rule requires that, once the procedure isinitiated, the burden of proof to prove that police acted legally in obtainingevidence falls on the procuratorate. But analysis of the court verdicts suggestthat in many cases, judges still expect the suspect or the defense to provethat torture had taken place:The two defendants said they did not commit the first fourcriminal acts as charged in the indictment, and that they were forced toconfess through torture. Because they cannot provide evidence, and there isevidence that proves that the two defendants committed the robberies on June 5and 6, 2013, the court will not accept this defense opinion.[313]Fu Hualing, a Chinese legal scholar, told Human Rights Watchthat in practice it remains unclear who has the burden of proof:In practice, [the question is], who has the responsibilityto provide evidence? Is it to prove that there is torture or is it to provethere is no torture? Who is responsible? It is the victim who said he wastortured, or the police who said he didn’t [torture the suspect]? Rightnow, it is whoever said he was tortured, that person must provide proof.[314]The exclusionary rule does not explicitly require the courtto order a medical evaluation of the victim, or to call in a medical expert totestify, though the judge can make such a decision in criminal trials.[315]Xie Ying, sister of a criminal suspect, said her brother’s request for amedical evaluation was ignored by the judges:He was shouting, requesting that a forensic examination bedone; he also showed the judge his injuries and scars, but the judge did notpay attention. I think he [the judge] said something like, we’ll talkabout that later, and then just ignored him.[316]Lawyer Mao Renrong also said judges ignored him when herequested medical evaluations for clients:I have tried making such requests, but the court neveragreed to them. They either don’t respond, or they ask the procurator toshow a written explanation. The suspect is a living being! Has he been torturedor not? You can tell through examining him, right? Why would you present apiece of paper to "prove" that he was not tortured?[317]Revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law empower the defensein this regard, by allowing them to make an application for “expertwitnesses” to testify in court.[318]But it remains up to judges to approve such requests, while few forensicexperts are willing to testify against the police.[319]Lawyers have also told Human Rights Watch that judges sometimesdid not even give them reasons for not excluding confessions. Lawyer XiaoGuosheng, from Beijing, told Human Rights Watch:We requested [the procedure] during the trial ... [thejudge] said he would adjourn the court to investigate, then when he reconvenedthe trial he said there was no such [torture], that the defense’s requestto exclude illegally obtained evidence could not be established. In just onesentence he dismissed the lawyers’ application.[320]Lawyer Chen Lihua, from Beijing, concurred:Last year, we went through the procedure. Then the judgesaid he wouldn’t make a conclusion [right away].… At the verdicthearing this year, they did not adopt [our argument]…. Nobody gives youan explanation why [it was not excluded].[321]Former judge Ran Sheng told Human Rights Watch that judgesare in a difficult position in applying the exclusionary rule because they arebound by law and practice to trust and work with the police and theprocuratorate:According to the Criminal ProcedureLaw, the relationship between the police, the procuratorate, and the court isfirst, cooperate with each other, and then, restrain each other. The startingpoint for the court is that the three agencies have a relationship oftrust…. So you believe [the police] unless the suspect has evidence toprove otherwise, for example, if the medical reports say otherwise, or if thelawyer presents written statements from other defendants who said theywitnessed torture. Sometimes you have doubts about the truth of the policestatement but the premise is that the police wouldn’t have made it up.[322]A casedescribed by lawyer Xiao Guosheng demonstrates how difficult it is to get aconfession excluded, even where there is considerable evidence in support ofthe defense’s torture claims:Werequested [that the court initiate] the exclusion procedure and for witnessesto appear in court … [f]our suspects ... were held in the same cell asmy client and [could] testify to how my defendant looked before he was takenout [of the detention center] and how he looked when he was returned.…We thought this was sufficient to prove there was torture. They all testifiedin court, and we, the procurator, and the judge all cross-examined them. Thejudge also asked questions, even in greater detail than we did.Wereceived the physical examination record only just before the trial opened atthe intermediate people’s court. The judge at the first instancehearing had not managed to obtain a copy earlier.… The record says hehad injuries on his wrists, but it added that they "may be the result ofself-injury." My client showed the judge his wrist injuries. The judgedidn’t comment on it directly at the time, but said, "We need tostudy this further."[At the end], the verdict states that so-and-so testifiedthat the defendant was taken out [of the detention center] in good physicalhealth and returned with injuries from such and such places. But you cannotrule out that the defendant had not inflicted these wounds himself. In otherwords, because these witnesses weren’t there at the scene [of torture],you can’t prove that the injuries were made by public security organs.[323]Chinese law does not incorporate the “fruit of thepoisonous tree” doctrine, according to which all evidence obtained as aresult of torture or other ill-treatment—not only the informationdirectly obtained through torture—is barred from being used in criminalproceedings. In the Chinese criminal system, even when a confession is excluded,other evidence derived from leads generated by the tainted confession,including similarly worded confessions recorded after torture, may be admittedin the proceedings. [324]Lawyer Lu Qinghua told Human Rights Watch:Even if the judge excludes illegally obtained evidence,these statements lead to other evidence, testimony of witnesses, physicalevidence, and so on.… [I]f the procuratorate offers 10 pieces ofevidence, and one is ruled out, the other nine are still adopted and the courtwould still find [the defendant] guilty.[325]Former judge Ran Sheng also acknowledged this important caveatto the exclusionary rule:[E]ven if you exclude one piece of evidence, the otherpieces would still be admitted. The police would tell the suspect [in subsequentinterrogations], “well, you’ve already said that you did it, whydon’t you admit it?”[326]As a result, successful exclusion of evidence obtainedthrough torture often does not make a difference in the outcome of the case. Formerjudge Ran Sheng described to Human Rights Watch one of such cases:There was one manslaughter case.… There were twosuspects, and one of them said he wasn’t the main culprit, that itwasn’t his idea. Then the procuratorate said, “But you admitted itin your confession.” [The suspect replied that police] had beat him upand [planted evidence], that the blood they “found” at the crimescene, as noted in the forensic record, had been drawn from him. And we looked[at his arm] and there was a wound from drawing blood. So we excluded thatconfession, but there was no real impact on the case really. He was stillsentenced to death.[327]Judges only extremely rarely hand down not guilty verdicts.In 2013, only 825 people were found not guilty in China out of an estimated1,160,000 verdicts—an acquittal rate of 0.07 percent.[328] None of the lawyers we interviewed said that any clients had been acquittedbecause evidence obtained through torture was excluded, though one, LuXiangming, said his client was released after his case was dismissed:In an assault case, the court told the procurator thatthere were problems with the evidence, and that, if he did not deal with it, thecourt would render a not-guilty verdict. So there are good judges like that. Theprocurators also found problems with the evidence in this case, plus there wastorture, and so the case was dismissed and the person released.[329]Ran Sheng explains why acquittals are so rare:If the court really wants to acquit the defendant, thecourt’s adjudication committee gets the police and the procuratoratetogether to get them psychologically prepared for what the court is thinkingand why it thinks that way. If the police are okay with it, the procuratorate usuallywithdraws the prosecution and there wouldn’t be a verdict. Because if thereis an acquittal, it means acknowledging that the police wrongly arrestedsomeone, that the procuratorate wrongly indicted someone, and that there willbe a need for state compensation.[330]As a number of legal scholarshave pointed out, the exclusionary rule is aimed at reducing wrongfulconvictions rather than torture per se.[331]According to legal scholar Ira Belkin, the rule atbest:[I]s intended to exclude only false confessions that wereobtained unlawfully. A defendant who succeeds in persuading a court that hisconfession was coerced must still answer the court’s questions about hisguilt or innocence … the rule may provide a remedy for a defendant whorecants his confession. For the defendant who was tortured before giving a trueconfession, however, there will be no relief.[332]Because China’sexclusionary rule still permits coercion to help identify other evidence, policecontinue to use torture to extract confessions, so it has little to no impacton the outcome of cases. Overall, the rule’s impact on police behavior islimited.V. Lack ofAccountabilityWe all knew that torture to extract confessions was wrong,but the laws aren’t being enforced. If torture to extract confessions isnot punished, how can the law be implemented?—Zheng Qianyang, former police officer, LiaoningProvince, February 2014I did make complaints! I complained many times, Icomplained to the procurator and to everyone who I can complain to! Theydidn’t deal with it, there was no response at all.—Yu Zhenglu, former criminal suspect, YunnanProvince, May 2014Police abuse is a function ofunchecked power. Police alone make all of the initial decisions to deprive suspectsof their liberty and have broad authority to extend detentions within certain,fairly flexible, legal limits. Police also control the facilities in whichsuspects are held.While China’s government recently has adopted somemeasures to address abuses in criminal detention, it has not made a comparableeffort to pursue greater accountability for those who abuse suspects. Policeofficers rarely face criminal sanctions for torturing or ill-treating suspects,although the law makes such behavior a criminal offense. Few even seem to faceserious disciplinary action, such as suspension or dismissal. At most, theirsuperiors issue a reprimand and move them to posts elsewhere in the force. HumanRights Watch interviews and our search and analysis of the SPC verdict databaseshow that there is little response from internal police supervisors and theprocuratorate, the agencies responsible for supervising police conduct andinvestigating police abuse, when those who have been mistreated in detentiontry to file complaints.Mechanisms that should holdpolice accountable regularly fail to do so. The procuratorate almostnever prosecute police officers for torture except in cases when suspects havedied or become disabled.[333]Even in those cases, the courts tend to give police officers light sentences.It is also very difficult for victims to obtain official compensation, and onthe rare occasions when compensation is forthcoming, the amount tends to below. In many cases, victims of torture and their families say that authoritiesignore them and repeatedly shift blame to other agencies when they seekcompensation or accountability; in some instances, they say they are harassedor threatened to stay silent.The Chinese law enforcement system is structured in waysthat require the police, the procuratorate, and the court to “mutuallycooperate” with each other to solve crimes under the leadership andcoordination of the CCP’s Political and Legal Committee at the samelevel.[334]This is especially true in political cases and during campaigns targeting particulartypes of crime. Because the procuratorate and the courts are required tocooperate with the police, which is more powerful than they are, under theleadership of the CCP Political and Legal Committee, it is difficult for themto check police abuse.[335]The reluctance to hold police officers accountable is also likely becausepolice play an important role in enabling the CCP to retain its grip on power.[336]In October 2014, the government announced at an importantannual Party meeting that it would establish a “life-long accountabilitymechanism” to hold accountable cadres whose decisions have led to“serious mistakes.”[337]The authorities appeared to be showing determination to implement the policytwo months later. Two days after the Inner Mongolian High Court posthumouslyacquitted Hugjiltu, a teenager executed in 1996 for murder and rape, theprovincial procuracy arrested the vice police chief who had presided over thecase.[338]It is unclear whether this decision will make an impact on other less prominentcases in the future.Internal Police Supervisionand the ProcuratorateOn paper, China’s police are subject to thesupervision of a number of government bodies and agencies. Within the policeforce, their conduct is monitored by what are called “internalsupervision police” and police legal departments; outside of the force,they are scrutinized by the procuratorate, the National People’s Congress,and the Ministry of Supervision and their counterpart institutions at loweradministrative levels.[339]Any Chinese citizen or organization can report police abuse to these agencies,which according to the Police Law should conduct “timelyinvestigations” and then inform the complainant of the results.[340]These supervisory bodies can impose administrative sanctionssuch as warnings, demotions, and even detention, as well as recommend thatpolice units rectify wrongdoing. In addition, the procuratorate can initiatecriminal prosecution against offending police officers and is the main bodythat handles investigation of torture.[341]Each agency has protocols to monitor police behavior andprevent torture. The internal police supervisors, for example, have authorityto conduct on-site supervision as police officers interrogate suspects; conductspot checks in detention centers; and, in certain police bureaus, monitorpolice officers through a real-time “audiovisual surveillance system.”[342]Police supervisors can suspend or order officers detained (upon approval fromthe police chief responsible for supervision), recommend the demotion or dismissalof offending officers, and refer cases to the procuratorate for prosecution.[343]Former detainees who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that noneof these supervisory mechanisms worked in their cases. Although the state mediahas recently highlighted a case of a procurator who helped overturn wrongfulconvictions, such cases appear to be unusual.[344]Suspects can complain to the procurator in charge of theircase when the latter meets with them before approving arrests. Suspects canrequest a meeting with another procurator (called the “procuratorstationed in the detention center”) in the detention center concerningtorture and ill-treatment in detention. But former detainees we spoke with saideither that they had not been aware that there were procurators stationed inthe detention centers, or that they did not request meetings with them as doingso required the approval of the cell boss or guards.Yu Zhenglu, who was tortured and spent 20 days in adetention center in 2012, told Human Rights Watch: “I didn’t seethe procurator stationed in the detention center. I didn’t know there wasone.”[345]Another detainee, Zuo Yi, who was severely abused by a cellboss during his detention in a Fujian detention center, said:I knew there was a procurator stationed in the detentioncenter, but I didn’t know that until the end. Others talked about “zhujiande”[a shorthand for “zhusuo jianchaguan (驻所检察官),”procurators stationed in the detention centers] but I didn’t know what itmeant.… In the end, I thought about making a compliant but I never got tosee him. I didn’t know how to meet him. If I told the guard about this,he would definitely punish me.[346]Former detainee and lawyer Wu Ying told Human Rights Watch:There was a procurator stationed in the detention center,there was a sign for it, but suspects don’t know how it works. Also youneed to get them make an appointment to see you. The question is if I am goingto complain about you, how can I trust you to arrange the meeting?[347]Procurators stationed in the detention centers, who tend toidentify with the police officers at the detention centers and “turn ablind eye” to police infractions, are generally ineffective in checkingpolice abuse.[348]In some detention centers, the procuratorate has also provided complaint boxes,but those were seen by some as ineffective. Detainee Feng Kun said:The complaint mailbox was very far away, and it would notopen, there was no opportunity to use it.[349]Former detainees also said that public security bureaus and internalsupervision police failed to investigate their claims after they submittedcomplaints alleging police abuse. After Lei Xinmu was released, for example, hemade complaints to all the supervisory departments about being tied to a “tigerchair” for days, but said he got only perfunctory answers:They [police officers] said they couldn’t handle thecase themselves and asked me to contact the cadres at the police bureau and thepolice chief. [But] I couldn’t get in touch with them. The internalinspector of the police telephoned me saying that the entire procedure [of mypolice interrogations] was legal, and they didn’t take any action.[350]Lawyer Xiao Guosheng told Human Rights Watch:The police supervisors are part of the police, so theresults [of our complaints] are usually not so good. Usually they tell us,“We’ll investigate,” and then there are no results.[351]Several former detainees we spoke with said supervisoryagencies met their complaints with silence. According to lawyer Shen Mingde,who has been trying to seek accountability for Chen Huiliang, who becamephysically disabled as a result of police torture:It is lost like a stone in the sea, they didn’tpursue accountability, there was no response. We sought to pursue criminalresponsibility and we reported the case to the procuratorate, but theyhaven’t responded. There has been no response from the procuratorate, noresponse after we filed a report to the police bureau. They told us when we metthat they’d study the case, but they never got back to us.[352]Cao Zuowei, who was hung up and beaten, said he complainedto the police supervisors but there was no follow-up investigation of his case:I went to the city public security bureau, theydidn’t do much. They did some superficial things, like registration [ofthe complaint], but they didn’t do much.[353]Bai Qingzuo said he had repeatedly contacted these agenciesbut had had no response from them:I gave all this evidence to thepublic security bureau, but they didn't give me any response. I have alsolodged a complaint with the procuratorate, which didn't respond either. Theysaid they would investigate the matter, but haven't given me a reply since then.[354]Former detainees and their family members also expressedfrustration that supervising agencies kept shifting the responsibility to otheragencies to investigate abuses, and said that after spending considerableeffort going to various authorities, they still have no answers. Jiang Yiguotold Human Rights Watch:We went … to the procuratorate who told us they hadtold the county police to investigate the matter, so we should wait forupdates. We didn't hear anything after waiting for a long time, so we wentagain. Then they told us, “You can go to the city's procuratorate.”But when we went to the city's procuratorate, they asked us to go to theprovincial procuratorate, who then told us to go [back] to the county police.[355]Others, like Gu Daoying, who was beaten with electric batonfor hours, said the supervising agencies responded but said the matter shouldbe resolved “privately”:I complained right after being released. I went to thehigher level police station and procuratorate complaining about the illegalacts of the police in-charge of the investigations. They knew all about it andthey told me it was all in the past, we should just work it out privately.There was no documentation. The police compensated me with some cash. There hasbeen no response from the procuratorate.[356]In some cases the answers from the procuratorate are simplynot credible. The procurator told Chen Aomin, the wife of a former suspectwhose torture left him unable to walk without crutches and with hearing and mentalconcentration impairments, that the torture was “just a smallissue”:I complained to the procuratorate [about my husband’storture in detention]. They said you don’t have any evidence. I said Ido. My husband was fine when he went in and now he is like this, who beat him?Isn’t this evidence? Do you want me to get the evidence right there atthe scene? How on earth do I get that evidence? The procuratorate said, well,then there was nothing they can do. The provincial procuratorate was evenworse. They said to me, “It might be a big deal for you that your husbandwas beaten up, but for us this was just a small issue.” I said,“Would it only be a big deal if he died?” They said, “Yes,that’s correct.”[357]Xie Ying, another family member of a detainee who was laterconvicted on the basis of a confession elicited through torture and who hasbecome paralyzed as a result of the torture, told Human Rights Watch that theycomplained to many government agencies but none looked into the case:We have been sending letters for three years but no oneever responded.… When we petitioned, the local police intercepted us.…At the time, to rid themselves of responsibilities, the judiciary said to me,“I want to handle the case properly too but there’s nothing we cando about the local Political and Legal Committee” … I have been tothe police hotline and [complaint] windows, but they are all bribed, they areso rotten thoroughly.… I have asked the procuratorate to uncover the useof torture to extract confession.… He said, “You said [mistreatmentleft him] disabled, but I didn’t see it. How am I going to intervene? Ican’t help you.” I got angry at him and said, “The job of theprocuratorate is to supervise courts, don’t you know the law?”[358]These statements are consistent with a 2006 study by Chineselegal scholar Wu Danhong, whose interviews with procurators revealed a greatreluctance to prosecute torture perpetrators:When the procurator’s office receives evidence offorced confession, they will first check if there is any serious consequencethat causes disability or death. If not, they generally do not make public thefindings, unless the conviction is wrong. Next they look at whether the case isreally solved and whether the suspect committed the crime. If they did, the factthat the suspect was tortured would not have any impact on their beingprosecuted. Finally, in serious cases of coerced confession, the Political andLegal Committee usually coordinates them. They decide whether to file the case.In many cases, [the police] are given administrative sanctions; even if thecases reach the level of criminal liability, as long as [the officers] pleadguilty and show repentance, they will not be prosecuted.[359]In addition, procurators told Wu that even in cases in whichthey took steps to investigate abuses, resistance from the police is strong:According to a procurator, when he handled a serious caseof forced confession, certain leaders at the Bureau of Public Security did notcooperate with the procuratorate’s investigation. The entire police uniteven rode their motorbikes to the procuratorate to "protest" and askfor their colleague to be released. When investigating the case of HuangShu-hong, the task force met many challenges that cause them to "spendmore than a year to process a case of forced confession that could have taken 7days to complete."[360]Thefailure of Chinese agencies to effectively supervise police conduct can beseen in a 2009 Fujian Province case, in which a local police chief wastransferred, rather than dismissed, demoted, or prosecuted, for a seriouscase of abuse under his command.SuspectChen Huiliang alleged that police officers held him for six months in 2007and 2008 in an illegal detention facility at the Longhai City Public SecurityBureau. He said that police officers tortured him by depriving him of sleep,tying him to a “tiger chair” for a total of 51 days, beating himwith police batons, and using an assortment of tools including shackles androds to wring his thighs. Chen lost the use of one leg and suffered frominjuries to spinal nerves, according to official records.[361]TheMinistry of Public Security’s Police Supervision Committee, afterreceiving Chen’s wife’s complaint, issued an internal policecircular acknowledging that while there were “problems” in theway this case was handled, including detaining the suspect in an illegallocation for 138 days and tying him to an interrogation chair for 20 days, itfound “no torture to extract confession.”[362]The committee sent the circular topublic security bureaus across the country, cautioning police officers thatthey must “enforce the law justly and in a civilized manner.”The policechief with command responsibility over the officers responsible for thealleged torture, Lin Shunde, was merely transferred to another police bureauin Zhangpu County. In Zhangpu County, suspects in a triad-related case in2012 alleged that Lin had again established illegal detention facilities atthe police bureau, and tortured them to confess.Scholarshave criticized internal police supervision as largely unsuccessful, withsupervision conducted without "sufficient competency orprofessionalism" and the teams “grossly understaffed,undertrained, and inadequately resourced."[363]Impunity for PerpetratorsOur superiors know about it, they all tolerate torture. Themany years I have been a police officer, there has not been one police officerwho has been punished for extracting confessions through torture. The cadres donot care or ask about the use of torture; if someone complains those lower downcan plead with the superiors.—Zheng Qianyang, a former police officer, February2014Lawyers and legal scholars told Human Rights Watch thatpolice officers are rarely held legally responsible for torture. Lawyer SongSanzuo told Human Rights Watch:Accountability is impossible. At most the police officerswould be demoted. Very rarely would police officers be punished.[364]Lawyer Yu Zheng said perpetrators are punished only when thetorture leads to serious injury or death:Unless you’ve killed the person, or caused themserious injury, few ever go to prison.[365]Lawyer Gu Geng said that even when officers are imprisonedthey tend to get off with very light sentences:According to the law, it is considered a crime when thepolice use torture. However, in practice it is rare that police officers areheld accountable. Even if they are, the punishment tends to be very light. Forexample, if a police officer beats a suspect to death, he will only besentenced to five or six years at most. The punishment [for killing thesuspect] can even be as light as simply being discharged from office or givenadministrative punishment.[366]As noted above, many suspects we spoke with also said thatthe police officers responsible for mistreating them have not faced prosecution;at most the officers have been demoted. Former detainee Cao Zuowei, who washung up and beaten, told Human Rights Watch: “The head of the PSB told methey’ve moved the deputy police chief to a patrol post, but I don’tknow the details.”[367]Even among the most prominent cases of wrongful convictions—mostof them the result of torture—few officers have been held legallyaccountable. In six such cases analyzed in a Chinese press article in whichsuspects were released after years of imprisonment, officers were punished inonly two cases.[368]And the officers were merely “disciplined” and faced no criminalpunishments. The head of the Zhejiang Provincial High Court said this wasbecause the officers did not intend to do wrong.[369]A few former detainees or their relatives told Human RightsWatch that the officers involved in their cases were actually promoted. ChenAomin, whose husband was physically disabled due to torture, told Human RightsWatch:They were going to promote one of the officers, but I wentto report him, and as a result he didn’t get promoted … but thenafter a couple of years, the other two [officers involved in the torture] werepromoted. I went to report them again, but the police still promoted them.... Notonly were they not punished they were twice promoted.[370]Xie Ying said officers whose torture left her brotherdisabled have been promoted for “solving” the case:Because of my brother’s case some people have beenpromoted. For example, the head of the city’s PSB was moved to theprovincial level.… The head of the procuratorate even praised him, andsaid that he withstood media pressure, making my brother’s case into acase “set in stone.” They all have been promoted.[371]In a 2011 report to the UN Committee against Torture, theChinese government said a total of 63 individuals were convicted for“torture to extract confession,”[372]“using violence to obtain evidence,”[373]and “abuse of supervisees,” though it is unclear how many of them werepolice officers.[374]Findings from PubliclyAvailable InformationOur search of all Chinese court verdicts published on the SPCwebsite during the first four months of 2014 found only one case in whichpolice officers were convicted for abusing criminal suspects. In that case, aLiaoning court convicted three police officers of “intentionalinjury.” According to the verdict, the officers “violentlybeat” the suspect while holding him in a vehicle, then brought him backto an interrogation room where they continued to beat him with electric batons.The suspect repeatedly complained of stomach pain, but was not sent to thehospital until 11 hours later, where he was diagnosed with a ruptured spleenand severe bleeding that endangered his life. All three were convicted, butnone served prison terms: two had three-year probations while the third wasexempted from criminal punishment.[375]We also analyzed press accounts over that same period,looking for cases in which police were reported to have been held accountablefor torture. We focused on three official Chinese newspapers—LegalDaily, a newspaper published by the CCP’s Political and LegalCommittee and managed by the Ministry of Justice; Procuratorate Daily, anewspaper published by the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (SPP); and the People’sPolice Daily—searching for “police officer” (jingcha警察), “verdict”(xuanpan宣判)and three official terms used to describe torture and abuses (which translateas “torture to extract confession,” “abuse of detainees,”and “use of violence to obtain evidence”).[376]We found dozens of articles referencing police abuse of detainees, but noarticles reporting that police were held accountable.During this same four-month period, however, authorities repeatedlytook action against acts of violence perpetrated by detainees. Human RightsWatch’s verdict search between January 1 and April 30, 2014 found 45decisions in which 50 criminal suspects were convicted of the crimes of“intentional injury,” “damagingorderly detention,” or fighting with other detainees in detentioncenters. Most involved brawls between detainees, but in at least 10 cases theverdicts suggested that the penalized individuals were serving in managerial orsupervisory roles within the detention center at the time of the incident, presumablyat the behest of the guards. Nearly all involved beatings of detainees thatresulted in “light injuries” but in one case the victim died and inanother the victim was badly injured. Five of these 10 cases stemmed from cellbosses’ dissatisfaction with the victim’s work in performing forcedlabor. In three cases the cell bosses punished the victims for somedisciplinary transgression, and in one case a police officer repeatedly instructedcell bosses to beat a victim for making complaints.[377]The perpetrators in these 10 cases received between eight months and threeyears in prison.While it is promising that a number of suspects wereconvicted for beating fellow detainees, perhaps indicating increasing resolve byauthorities to take action against cell bosses since 2009, in none of the caseswere police officers held accountable for using or tolerating cell bosses. Asnoted above, former detainees told Human Rights Watch that there is littleredress for violence by cell bosses: detainees who complain about such abuses tothe guards are moved to another cell, ignored, or worse still, punished; butthe cell bosses are not punished.Zuo Yi, who was severely abused by a cell boss for over ayear in detention, told Human Rights Watch that the guard did not respond evenwhen the cell boss openly acknowledged that he had beat Zuo:The guard came in and asked, “Who hit him?” Thecell boss said it was him, and the guard said nothing. He didn’t ask meto make a statement or explain anything. There was no investigation.[378]Lack of Compensationand Rehabilitation for VictimsTorture victims can apply for compensation under the Law ofState Compensation.[379]The law, effective since January 1995, was amended in 2010 and in 2012 toimprove victims’ access to compensation from the government.[380]In theory, it compensates victims of police abuse that result in physicalinjury, disability, or death, as determined by forensic experts. None of thedetainees or their family members interviewed by Human Rights Watch, however,said they had received state compensation.The first challenge in claiming compensation is provingpolice responsibility for one’s injuries. Because the court,procuratorate, and police rarely acknowledge that torture has taken place, itis difficult for victims to claim compensation. Lawyer Shen Mingde told HumanRights Watch: “The problem is there has to be first an [official]acknowledgement of coerced confession before there can be compensation.”[381]As noted above, detainees face extreme obstacles to obtaining and retainingevidence of abuse; judges and procurators, who have the capacity to seek outthe truth, rarely do so.Our search of court verdicts from early 2014 shows that manyapplications seeking state compensation for injuries and disability caused bytorture during pre-trial detention are turned down on the grounds thatapplicants did not prove that police used torture.Complainant Zhu Haibo claims that as a result of torture byPublic Security Bureau staff, he suffers from frostbite in his bones as well asdisability, but Zhu did not provide the relevant evidence.… ComplainantZhu Haibo’s reasons and his complaints cannot be established.[382]Medical records from Zhejiang Prison Hospital and HangzhouCity Red Cross Hospital did not record external injuries during generalphysical check-up when Yang Jinhui was admitted [in the hospital for treatmentof diseases].… These facts combined with other evidence collected in the casefile cannot confirm that the Public Security Bureau tortured or abused YangJinhui during detention.… In summary, Yang Jinhui does not havesufficient basis to claim compensation from Yiwu Detention Center and YiwuPublic Security Bureau for injuries caused by the use of torture to extractconfession and abuse.[383]Even in the rare cases in which authorities acknowledgeresponsibility for abuse, state compensation is only available to those whohave physical injuries. Lawyer Zhang Rong told Human Rights Watch:If you do not reach the [official] levels of disability,you may not be compensated. The police are now very skillful at torture, theydo not immediately cause disability.[384]Those who have no physical injuries may still be eligiblefor state compensation for lost work days if, in addition to being physicallyabused, they were illegally or wrongfully detained. But lawyer Mao Renrongpointed out that such rulings are rare:State compensation is usually given only to those who havebeen acquitted for wrongful convictions, those usually have no problemaccessing it. But [even in those cases] they compensate you only for the timeyou spent in detention, not for the torture itself.… They stilldon’t acknowledge that torture has taken place.[385]The amount of compensation for lost days of work is small,calculated based on average annual wages across the country. Lawyer Zhang Rongsaid:You can seek state compensation [for lost work hours],which is calculated by multiplying the number of days you were detained by theaverage wage, but the amount is relatively small.[386]In 2013, the Chinese government gave out a total of RMB 87.4million (US$14.2 million) in 2,045 cases, but it is unclear what portion wentto survivors of torture in pre-trial detention.[387]Victims and their families and Chinese media have criticized the low levels ofcompensation and the basis for calculating it.[388]One scholar at Shandong University of Political Science and Law wrote:When torture is used and harms a person, just compensatingthe victim on the basis of the average daily wage of the previous yearunderestimates a person’s value … the use of torture to extractconfession … results in not only bodily harm and pain on the victim, butit also seriously impact their quality of life, as well as enormous mentalsuffering for them and their families … and yet according to compensationstandards, the victim is only entitled to dozens of RMB every day; [thecompensation] is very disproportional to the enormous mental pain and injury tothe victims and their families.[389]Even the Supreme People’s Court acknowledges that theamount of compensation is lower than it should be. According to a spokespersonof the SPC:By all means, there is a certain gap between the currentcompensation standards and the pains of those who suffer injustices as well asthe public’s expectations. As the Supreme People’s Court, we givehigh importance to the people’s demands [...] and commit to ensuringmaximum protection of the applicant’s legitimate rights and interestswithin the legal boundaries.[390]Victims and families of victims told Human Rights Watch theyhave not received official acknowledgment of police abuse or been provided withstate compensation. Instead, the police in several instances have offered them“humanitarian aid,” a lump sum, or promised to pay for medicalexpenses. Typically this is paid out by the police bureau or the individualofficer’s own personal account, and is explicitly in exchange for avictim’s silence. Interviewees told of being given between 20,000RMB($3200) and 50,000 RMB ($8100) by the police.Cao Zuowei told Human Rights Watch that after he was hung upand beaten, the local leaders tried to prevent him from seeking accountabilityby offering him money:The Party Secretary came himself, but in the end he onlygave me RMB20,000. I still don’t know what happened. They didn’tgive me any documents saying they did wrong. Afterwards … they wrote astatement saying I didn’t suffer any bodily or property damage [in thepolice station] and asked me to copy and sign it.[391]Chen Aomin told Human Rights Watch of a similarcash-for-silence offer made to her husband:Perhaps they were afraid that we’d go online andcomplain. They wanted us to sign an agreement, which says that after hisreturn, we cannot use the Internet to appeal our case. They let us choose oneof the local hospitals.… The police would pay [the hospital] directly[for treatment], and then there is RMB50,000 on top of this, and after half a yearthey would evaluate our situation and compensate us depending on his level ofdisability.… But until now we haven’t taken one cent from them …[because] the hospitals would not take him, the hospital said his leg has beenleft untreated too long, and now they cannot treat him.[392]Victims have also complained that, even in cases in whichmoney has been promised to them, the police resist paying the full amount. CaoZuowei told Human Rights Watch:After I revealed the case on the Internet, [the police]sent me to the hospital this year to do some rehabilitative treatment. I havebeen evaluated as Level 7 [light to medium level] disability. They gave memoney for treatment, but recently they didn’t. It’s been over 10days, they still haven’t. What should ordinary people like us do?[393]Zuo Yi, who suffered permanent injury from the abuses of acell boss, said the procurator reneged on compensation he had promised:I went to talk to the head of the procuratorate after beingreleased and he said that I would be compensated. But my request has beenrepeatedly ignored after the head was relocated.[394]In some cases, victims and their families complain that theyhave endured retaliation for seeking accountability, compensation, or simply anacknowledgement that torture had taken place. Former detainee Zhang Chun toldHuman Rights Watch:They didn’t [give me compensation]. They keptthreatening me … I have injuries all over: hands, feet, nerves in thelower body.… There’s nothing to be done.… I don’t havemuch hope, I just hope to get clarity on this.[395]Yang Jinli, like some of the interviewees, had triedpetitioning the authorities, and was briefly detained for doing so:I’ve gone to Beijing to petition. Every time I go Ihave to go a roundabout way, [or else] surely I’d be intercepted [byofficials]. Also my phone has 24-hour surveillance. Am I a criminal?[396]Chen Aomin told Human Rights Watch:I went once to Beijing to petition [about myhusband’s torture], [but] I was taken into custody and sent back.Afterwards I didn’t go anymore.[397]VI. RecommendationsThe Chinese government should demonstrate its commitment toeradicating torture and ill-treatment in detention by immediately issuing aninvitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and the UN Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights to conduct independent investigations into thetreatment of detainees in police custody in China. Their findings would contributeto the review of China’s record under the Convention against Torture inNovember 2015 and help provide a roadmap for further reforms aimed ateliminating abusive police behavior.The National People’s CongressTransfer the power to manage detention centersfrom the Ministry of Public Security to the Ministry of Justice.Revise the Criminal Procedure Law to:Ensure that suspects may have lawyers present during any policequestioning and interrogations;Stipulate suspects’ right to remain silent duringquestioning;Adopt the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrinewith respect to the exclusionary rule;Ensure that anyone taken into police custody be promptly broughtbefore a judge, normally within 48 hours of being apprehended, as is required  inHong Kong and many other jurisdictions;Mandate that all interrogations of suspects and witnesses to beused in proceedings be videotaped in their entirety, and that a complete copyof the interrogations be made available to the defense and the court;Mandate that police conduct criminal interrogations only inrooms designated for interrogation in detention centers and police stations;Mandate that lawyers be allowed to accompany suspects when theyare taken out of detention centers to identify a crime scene or for otherpurposes;Expressly permit witnesses to appear in court during proceedingsto determine whether confessions ought to be excluded as evidence due toalleged torture. Possible witnesses should include independent forensicexperts, fellow detainees, doctors in contact with the suspects, and policeofficers involved in investigations and custody of the detainee;Repeal articles that allow suspects charged with terrorism,major corruption, or state security offenses to be subjected to six months ofsecret detention without lawyers under “designated residentialsurveillance.”Establish an independent Civilian PoliceCommission (“Commission”) composed of independent members withknowledge of detention facility conditions and police practices and provideadequate funding to it by law. Members should include human rights advocates,defense lawyers, and former detainees, as well as policing experts and others considerednecessary for the Commission’s work. Members should be protected frompersonal liability for acts performed in good faith.The Commission should be empowered to:Conduct investigations with respect to alleged policemisconduct, including deaths in custody and police abuse; 2) conduct inquiries,on its own initiative, concerning complaints made about the policies orpractices of the police force or about the behavior of individual policeofficers; 3) make unannounced visits to all official and unofficial detentioncenters to speak with individual detainees in private; 4) publish statisticswith respect to police practices, such as complaints filed and acted upon; 5)make public recommendations with respect to the policies or practices of thepolice to the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate,and the Ministry of Justice; and 6) provide compensation to victims of tortureor ill-treatment. Determine on clear and convincing evidence,after holding hearings with witnesses, that a police officer who has engaged inor overseen misconduct, be demoted, suspended with or without pay for aspecified period, or removed. Such decisions should be subject to appeal beforean appropriate court.

Can the Ministry explain why, given theserules, detainees have told Human Rights Watch that their communication withtheir families is severely restricted in practice? What measures has theMinistry taken to ensure that suspects have effective means of communicationwith their families while in detention, including visits, phone calls andletters?Under theCriminal Procedure Law (CPL), lawyers have access to suspects upon presentationof “three documents.”[399] But lawyers have complained about continuedobstacles, such as additional requirements for documents not required by law,and various excuses by the police. Somesuspects have also reported that police fail to pass on their requests forlawyers, a problem compounded by restricted access to families. What measureshas the Ministry taken to address these continued obstacles to access tolawyers?According tothe Criminal Procedure Law, interrogations of suspects who might be sentencedto death or life imprisonment and “other major crimes” must bevideotaped.[400] What measures has the Ministry taken to ensure thatthe police fulfill the requirement to make audio or visual recordings of allinterrogations, and how it safeguards against police selectively recording onlyinterrogation sessions that do not involve torture?What measureshas the ministry taken to ensure that torture does not take place outside ofthese facilities?

But as local interests cancontinue to influence judges’ decisions through other means, the actualimpact of these reforms on judicial independence is likely limited. The ChineseCommunist Party has also called for less interference in court cases by thesecommittees, but so far the impact of these efforts are not known.
