They took me to their office. Thesewere interrogators…. They slapped me on the cheeks repeatedly…. Butthese interrogators are not in a position to listen to what I tell them. Theybeat me again with the black stick and slapped me again. I stayed in that roomuntil midnight. I was exhausted. They took me back to the cell and then tookanother guy. On the second day of interrogations—the beating was worse.What they want is a confession.”—Journalist held in Maekelawi in mid-2011, Nairobi,April 2012In the heart of Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, near ahotel and an Orthodox Christian cathedral, lies one of the country’s mostnotorious police stations, the Federal Police Crime Investigation Sector, commonlyknown as Maekelawi. Many of Ethiopia’s political prisoners—oppositionpoliticians, journalists, protest organizers, alleged supporters of ethnicinsurgencies , and many others—are first taken to Maekelawi (“central”in Amharic), after being arrested. There they are interrogated, and, for many, atMaekelawi they suffer all manner of abuses, including torture.Police investigators at Maekelawi use coercive methods ondetainees amounting to torture or other ill-treatment to extract confessions, statements,and other information from detainees. Detainees are often denied access tolawyers and family members. Depending on their compliance with the demands of investigators,detainees are punished or rewarded with denial or access to water, food, light,and other basic needs.This report documents human rights abuses, unlawfulinvestigation tactics, and detention conditions in Maekelawi between 2010 and 2013.For the report Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 35 former detainees ofMaekelawi and their family members. Although Human Rights Watch was not able tovisit Maekelawi, preventing first-hand observation of conditions and interviewswith current detainees, researchers cross-checked information provided byformer detainees, who were identified through various channels and interviewed individually.Allegations of arbitrary detention, torture, and other ill-treatmentat the hands of Ethiopian police and other security forces are not new. But sincethe disputed 2005 elections, the Ethiopian government has intensifiedrestrictions on freedom of expression, association, and assembly, deploying arange of measures to clamp down on dissent. These include arresting anddetaining political opposition figures, journalists, and other independentvoices, and implementing laws that severely restrict independent human rightsmonitoring and press freedom.Since 2009 a new law, the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, hasbecome a particularly potent instrument to restrict free speech. Thelaw’s provision undermine basic legal safeguards against prolonged pre-chargedetention and unfair trials. In this context, Maekelawi has become an importantsite for the detention and investigation of some of the most politicallysensitive cases. Many detainees accused of offenses under the law—includingsome of Ethiopia’s most prominent political prisoners—have been detainedin the Maekelawi facility as their cases were investigated or prepared fortrial.Maekelawi has four primary detention blocks, each with anickname, and the conditions differ significantly among them. Several formerdetainees described to Human Rights Watch how they were transferred from oneblock to another in the course of their investigation, with treatment andconditions of detention linked to cooperation with the investigators.Conditions are particularly harsh in the detention blocks known by detainees as“Chalama Bet” (dark house in Amharic) and “Tawla Bet” (woodenhouse). In Chalama Bet detainees have limited access to daylight, to a toilet,and are on occasion in solitary confinement. In Tawla Bet access to thecourtyard is restricted and the cells were infested with fleas. Short ofrelease, most yearn to transfer to the block known as “Sheraton,” dubbedfor the international hotel, where the authorities allow greater movement andaccess to lawyers and relatives.Maekelawi officials, primarily police investigators, have torturedand ill-treated detainees by various methods. Detainees described to HumanRights Watch being repeatedly slapped, kicked, punched, and beaten with sticksand gun butts. Some reported being forced into painful stress positions, suchas being hung by their wrists from the ceiling or being made to stand withtheir hands tied above their heads for several hours at a time, often while beingbeaten. Detainees also face prolonged handcuffing in their cells—in onecase over five continuous months—and frequent verbal threats duringinterrogations. Some endured prolonged solitary confinement, which can amountto torture.Detainees also described dire conditions of detention,including inadequate food, severe restrictions on access to daylight, poorsanitary conditions, and limited medical treatment. Conditions are particularlyharsh during initial investigations.The coercive methods, exacerbated by the poor detentionconditions, are used by the authorities at Maekelawi to maximize pressure ondetainees to extract statements, confessions, and otherinformation—whether accurate or not—to implicate them and others inalleged criminal activity. These statements and confessions are in turn sometimesused to coerce individuals to support the government once released, or as evidenceagainst them at trial.Former detainees and their relatives told Human Rights Watchthat they were routinely denied access to legal counsel and family membersduring the initial weeks of their custody. Some were held incommunicadothroughout months of detention. The absence of a lawyer during interrogations increasesthe likelihood of abuse, hinders any documentation of ill-treatment and tortureby investigators, and limits chances of obtaining redress before the courts. Inthis way police investigators at Maekelawi obstruct basic national andinternational legal safeguards protecting persons in custody such as thoseregulating arrest and detention and protection from the use of forcedconfessions as evidence at trial.Detainees have limited channels for redress. Ethiopia’scourts do not demonstrate independence in political cases. Courts that have receivedallegations of detainee torture and ill-treatment at Maekelawi have on occasionfailed to take adequate steps to address the allegations. Several formerdetainees told Human Rights Watch they kept silent about their treatment incourt, fearing reprisals from investigators. Others said they had neverappeared before a court.Human rights monitoring of all detention locations inEthiopia, including Maekelawi, by government agencies is limited andindependent monitoring of any kind is insufficient. Representatives from thegovernment-affiliated Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and other officials havevisited Maekelawi and have raised some concerns about detention conditions inprivate and public communications. However, former detainees told Human RightsWatch that commission representatives were accompanied by Maekelawi officials,and the visits have not resulted in concrete improvements in their situation.Over the past decade Human Rights Watch and other domesticand international human rights organizations have documented patterns ofserious human rights violations, including arbitrary arrest and detention,ill-treatment, and torture in many official and unofficial detention facilitiesthroughout Ethiopia. The government has invariably dismissed these findings or conductedinvestigations that lack credibility.However, the Ethiopian government has taken some positive stepsin recent years to comply with its international human rights treaty reportingrequirements and develop human rights policies on paper. In 2010 Ethiopiasubmitted its first report to the United Nations Committee against Torture, theexpert reporting body of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.The government has also drafted a national human rightsaction plan for 2013-2015. The draft seen by Human Rights Watch contains some measuresthat could help improve detention conditions and treatment of pre-trial detaineesand convicted prisoners. The plan rightly identifies insufficient access tolegal counsel during pre-charge detention, insufficient complaint mechanisms,and inadequate access to food, medical care, and other services as challenges thatneed to be addressed.The Ethiopian authorities, particularly the federal police, shouldurgently adopt concrete measures to address these persistent concerns inMaekelawi and other facilities. Ensuring that suspects enjoy the protections ofdue process, including the right to understand the reason for their arrest, andaccess to legal counsel and relatives from the outset of their detention wouldhelp reduce abuses.Prosecutors and judges should also proactively monitor thetreatment of persons in custody and investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatmentwithout official interference or obstruction. At the same time, they shouldalso ensure protection for detainees who dare to speak out about theirtreatment.The authorities should also allow unfettered and unannouncedaccess to Maekelawi and other detention centers throughout the country to independentEthiopian and international monitors, including human rights and humanitarianorganizations, members of the diplomatic community, and United Nations (UN) andAfrican Union (AU) human rights mechanisms such as the Special Rapporteur ontorture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the WorkingGroup on Arbitrary Detention.Unfortunately, the government’s response to criticism ofits human rights record has largely been to characterize abuses solely as alack of capacity, training, or resources, and ignoring the key role ofpolitical will, accountability of perpetrators, and redress to victims to end widespreadtorture and ill-treatment.Additional resources can alleviate some of the poordetention conditions in facilities like Maekelawi, but real change in the treatmentof detainees needs to come from the highest levels of government. Ethiopia’sleadership, from the prime minister to the federal police commissioner and thefederal affairs minister, should be sending a public message that themistreatment of detainees will not be tolerated—and back up suchpronouncements with disciplinary action and prosecutions of those officials whoviolate the law. Crucial for this is a judiciary that has the independence toreceive and act on complaints from those in custody and hand down impartialjustice. And to deter politically motivated prosecutions in the first place,parliament should substantially amend the Charities and Societies Proclamation andthe Anti-Terrorism Proclamation.Only if such actions are taken would Ethiopia’sgovernment be able to demonstrate that it is truly committed to addressing the serioushuman rights violations being committed daily.RecommendationsTo the Ethiopian GovernmentIssue public orders to the federalpolice and other law enforcement personnel deployed at Maekelawi to ceaseunlawful detention, torture, and ill-treatment of all persons in custody.Promptly, transparently, andimpartially investigate all allegations of ill-treatment and ensure that allpersonnel implicated in custodial abuse, regardless of rank, areappropriately disciplined or prosecuted.Significantly improve legalsafeguards at Maekelawi and other detention centers, including ensuring theright to access a lawyer from the outset of a detention, presence of legalcounsel during all interrogations, and prompt access to family members andmedical personnel.Ensure that no statement or confessionobtained through torture or other coercion is admitted as evidence attrial. Take necessary steps to prevent and punish any interference byofficials in efforts by prosecutors and judges to investigate allegationsof torture and ill-treatment.Promptly release from custody anddrop any charges against all persons arbitrarily detained, particularlythose arrested for the peaceful exercise of their fundamental rights, suchas freedom of expression, association, and assembly.Close all facilities at Maekelawithat do not meet international standards as set out under the UN StandardMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.Take all necessary steps toend incommunicado detention and prolonged solitary confinement atMaekelawi and other detention facitilities.Allow independent oversight ofMaekelawi and other detention facilities and prisons by providing accessby independent human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations toengage in unhindered monitoring of conditions and private meetings withdetainees.Offer a standing invitation torelevant United Nations and African Union human rights mechanismsincluding the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman ordegrading treatment or punishment and the Working Group on ArbitraryDetention to visit Ethiopia.Immediately establishcomplaints mechanisms within Maekelawi and other detention facilities as setout in the draft National Human Rights Action plan.Ensure that the federalpolice, public prosecutors, and other law enforcement personnel receiveappropriate training on interrogation practices that adhere tointernational human rights standards.Amend the Charities and Societies Proclamation and theAnti-Terrorism Proclamation to bring them into line with the Ethiopianconstitution and Ethiopia’s obligations under international lawregarding freedom of association, expression, and peaceful assembly.To the Ethiopian ParliamentAmend the Charities andSocieties Proclamation and the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to bring theminto line with the Ethiopian constitution and Ethiopia’s obligationsunder international law regarding freedom of association, expression, andpeaceful assembly.Amend provisions in theCriminal Procedure Code that are contrary to Ethiopia’s internationallegal obligations to ensure that detainees have prompt access to a judge, preventprolonged pre-trial detention, and clarify evidentiary standards to ensurethat no statements, confessions, or other information obtained as a resultof torture or other ill-treatment can be accepted as evidence.Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention againstTorture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which would allow visits to Ethiopia by the protocol’sSubcommittee on Prevention of Torture, and the Optional Protocol tothe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which allows forcomplaints to be filed before an independent UN committee.To the Ethiopian JudiciaryEnsure that complaints ofmistreatment during detention are promptly and impartially investigated bya body independent of the police. Government bodies that disregard orblock judicial orders regarding mistreament of detainees should beappropriately sanctioned.Enforce measures to ensurethat detainees who bring complaints about mistreatment are protected fromreprisals.Ensure that statements, confessions,and other information obtained through torture or other ill-treatment are notadmitted as evidence. In casesof a claim that evidence was obtained through coercion, the authoritiesmust provide information to the judiciary about the circumstances in whichsuch evidence was obtained to allow an assessment of the allegations.sEnsure that pre-trial detention is used as an exceptionalmeasure in accordance with international law and that it is used for theshortest time possible by requiring prosecutors to demonstrate the need tokeep detainees in custody.To the Ethiopian Federal Police CommissionImmediately release thosedetainees in Maekelawi or other detention facilities who have not beenbrought promptly to court to be charged. Ensure that suspects who havebeen charged receive a fair and public trial without undue delay.Ensure that pre-trialdetention is used as an exceptional measure in accordance withinternational law.Enhance monitoring of theconduct of federal police investigators and other officers at Maekelawi. Conductfrequent spot checks, interview privately and confidentially detainees abouttheir treatment and conditions of detention, and impartially investigateallegations of ill-treatment and torture.Take measures to end incommunicadodetention and prolonged solitary confinement at Maekelawi and other detentionfacitilities.Publish statistics of complaints brought by detaineesregarding mistreatment in Maekelawi and other federal detention centersand publicly report on complaints filed, including by providing data onthe number of police suspended, prosecuted, or otherwise disciplined forunlawful conduct.To the Ethiopian Human RightsCommissionCarry out frequent,unannounced visits to Maekelawi and other detention centers, privately andconfidentially interview detainees, and follow-up on allegations of mistreatment.Systematically monitor hearings of detainees held inMaekelawi and follow-up with relevant authorities on complaints of mistreatment,including possible reprisals at Maekelawi or after their transfer to otherfacilities.To the Donor CommunityPublicly and privately raiseconcerns with Ethiopian government officials at all levels regardingtorture, ill-treatment, and other human rights violations in Maekelawi andother detention facilities in Ethiopia. Press especially the federalaffairs minister, the federal police commissioner, and the justiceminister to adopt policies to end the abuse and ensure those responsibleare held to acccount.Publicly urge prompt,transparent, and impartial investigations into allegations of abuse indetention facilities.Actively seek unhinderedaccess to Maekelawi and other detention facilities for international humanrights and humanitarian organizations and for diplomats.Urge Ethiopian officials toinvite relevant UN and AU human rights mechanisms, including the UN SpecialRapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment orpunishment and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit Ethiopia.Monitor trials of defendantscharged with offenses under the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation and call onthe authorities to protect all defendants’ right to a publichearing.Call for the amendment of the Charities and SocietiesProclamation and the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation.MethodologyIn the course of monitoring the human rights situation in Ethiopiaover the past decade, Human Rights Watch has frequently received allegations ofserious abuses against detainees at the Federal Police Crime InvestigationsSector, commonly known as Maekelawi, in Addis Abbaba. For this report, HumanRights Watch interviewed 30 men who were detained in Maekelawi between 2010 and2012, including two Swedish journalists Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye heldin Maekelawi in 2011, and about five family members and lawyers of current orformer Maekelawi detainees.The former detainees were interviewed individually.Interviews were carried out in person and via telephone between April 2012 andAugust 2013 in various locations, including Ethiopia, neighboring countries thathost Ethiopian refugees—Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti, South Africa—andthe United States and Sweden. Interviewees were identified through a wide varietyof sources and channels, including on the recommendation of former detainees.The interviews took from one hour to more than 10 hours. Theywere all conducted in English or with an interpreter from Afan Oromo or Amharicto English. Human Rights Watch took various precautions to verify thecredibility of interviewees’ statements. All the information in thisreport was based on at least two and usually more than two independent sources;where allegations were not corroborated by at least two independent sources wehave excluded those statements from this report. Although this report is basedprimarily on interviews, we also consulted a variety of secondary material thatprovided valuable corroboration of details or patterns described in thisreport. This material includes previous Human Rights Watch research, including dozensof unpublished interviews with former detainees who experienced similar abuses inMaekelawi or other detention facilities prior to 2010, as well as informationcollected by other credible independent human rights investigators.None of the interviewees were offered any form of compensationfor agreeing to participate in interviews. All former detainees and theirrelatives were informed of the purpose of the interview and its voluntarynature, including their right to stop the interview at any point, andvoluntarily consented to be interviewed.We asked several former detainees to describe the facilitiesin detail and to draw its layout, which helped us to corroborate informationfrom different witnesses and get a detailed picture of the physical structureof Maekelawi. In some instances of allegations of ill-treatment, Human RightsWatch documented physical scars consistent with the alleged implements usedagainst the individuals. In incidents in which the method of torture leftminimal physical evidence, former detainees interviewed on different days andin different locations described identical or nearly identical treatment duringinterrogations and in interrogations rooms in Maekelawi.We asked former detainees to name and describe thoseinvolved in interrogations. Detainees were often unable to identify individualofficials, either because the investigators did not provide their names, or,when detainees heard names they suspected they were false names. Occasionallydetainees said they could not provide descriptions of their investigators becausethey were blindfolded. In some cases, it was possible to corroborate the namesof investigators involved in similar types of interrogations and abuses ofdetainees.A number of detainees were transferred between differentblocks in Maekelawi, which meant they were able to provide comparativedescriptions of different sections. All the interviewees whose accounts havebeen incorporated in this report were initially detained in the two detentionblocks where conditions and treatment are the worst—Tawla Bet and ChalamaBet—so this report focuses on those two blocks, not on the other twoblocks—the women’s section and the block known as“Sheraton.”More than half of the individuals interviewed by HumanRights Watch were never charged although they were detained for prolongedperiods of time, between four days and eight months, and then released. Six ofthose interviewed were charged but never tried or sentenced and were releasedon bail upon a court order or upon conditions set arbitrarily by the policeinvestigators. Several were held under the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation’sremand detention provisions.Because the Ethiopian government seeks to prevent humanrights research in the country, this report is not a comprehensive assessment ofthe situation in Maekelawi. Rather it offers an insight into the torture and otherill-treatment experienced by a group of detainees largely held for politicallymotivated reasons.While Human Rights Watch interviewed some former detaineesand family members who are in Ethiopia, others still living in the country declinedto share their experiences due to fear of government retaliation. Theirconcerns are real. Once released, most individuals who have been detained inMaekelawi are at high risk of continued monitoring and reprisals by theauthorities. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch and other independentinternational and national human rights organizations face extraordinarychallenges to carrying out investigations in Ethiopia. This is mainly becauseof the difficulty of assuring the safety and confidentiality of victims ofhuman rights abuses, given the government’s hostility towards humanrights investigation and reporting.The Ethiopian government routinely dismisses human rightsreports, regularly criticizes Human Rights Watch as an organization, anddismisses the findings of our research. This heightens concerns that any formof involvement with Human Rights Watch, including speaking to the organization,could be used against individuals. The authorities have harassed and detainedindividuals for providing information to or meeting with international humanrights investigators. Furthermore, telephone and email communications have beenused as evidence against journalists in recent politically motivated anti-terrorismtrials, heightening concerns about any communications.Most former detainees interviewed for this research had leftEthiopia, making it easier for them to speak openly about their experience.However, given the ongoing deep concerns about security of many of thoseinterviewed, all names and identifying information have been removed. Locationsof interviews are also withheld where that information could suggestsomeone’s identity.Human Rights Watch was not able to visit Maekelawi given therestrictions on independent human rights work, the difficulty of adhering tobasic ethical standards on research inside detention facilities in the currentenvironment, and the risk of reprisals against detainees following such avisit.Human Rights Watch sent letters on August 12, 2013, to the ministerfor federal affairs and to the head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commissionposing questions and requesting information about issues related to Maekelawi.Responses were received on September 9 and 10, 2013. The letters are reproducedin the annexes to this report and referenced within the body of the reportwhere relevant.I. BackgroundEthiopia’s government is led by the EthiopianPeople’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of ethnicallybased parties that came to power in 1991 after overthrowing the militarydictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam. The EPRDF has become increasinglyintolerant of dissent and criticism since 2005 when controversy over electionresults prompted unprecedented public protests, triggering a bloody government crackdown.[1]Since 2005 the EPRDF has consolidated its control over political space andpublic discourse using repressive legislation, arbitrary arrests, and politicallymotivated prosecutions to severely restrict freedom of expression, association,assembly, and opinion.[2]The arrest and prosecution of 131 members of the politicalopposition, journalists, and civil society activists for “treason”following the 2005 elections signaled the start of the crackdown onindependent, dissenting voices that has continued to the present day.[3]In 2009 the government passed two laws that have been instrumental in thesuppression of media and nongovernmental activity. The first, the Anti-TerrorismProclamation (or Anti-Terrorism Law),[4] has beenused primarily to target journalists and opposition figures, some of whom havebeen detained for months without charge or convicted under its overly broad provisions.[5]The second, the draconian Charities and Societies Proclamation (the CSO Law),[6]has severely restricted independent human rights activity in the country,making it very difficult for organizations to seek funding and carry out basichuman rights work.[7]Since the sudden death in August 2012 of Ethiopia’slongtime leader, Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia’s new prime minister, HailemariamDesalegn, has shown little inclination to change tack and implement the kind ofhuman rights reforms that would foster independent voices or rein in the rulingparty’s complete dominance.The patterns of arbitrary arrests and detentions andill-treatment of detainees show no sign of abating. Ethiopian authorities haveresponded to two years of peaceful protests by members of Ethiopia’sMuslim community with harassment, assaults, arbitrary arrests, and detention ofhundreds of protesters and politically motivated charges against the protestleadership.[8]Patterns of Arbitrary Arrest, Torture, andIll-TreatmentArbitrary Arrests and DetentionEthiopian police and other security forces are regularly implicatedin arbitrary arrest and detention and the violation of basic due process rights.Those particularly vulnerable to such abuse include activist students; protesters;journalists; members of the political opposition, particularly ethnic Oromoparties; alleged supporters of insurgent groups, such as the Oromo LiberationFront (OLF) and the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF); and anyonesuspected in broadly defined “terrorist” activities.[9]Cases of arbitrary arrests and detention in Addis Ababa, particularlythose concerning high-profile opposition members, civil society activists, and journalists,are generally better documented and publicized. Patterns of arrests anddetentions in the rural areas have been far more difficult to investigate,particularly as the government’s restrictions on independent human rightsactivity have escalated in recent years.Human Rights Watch and other independent human rightsorganizations have documented the use of arbitrary detention as a means ofpunishing perceived dissent in various contexts throughout the country,including in Oromia in the early 2000s,[10] in theGambella region in 2003 and 2011,[11] in theSomali region in 2007-2008,[12] in theSouth Omo region of SNNPR in 2012, and throughout the decade in Addis Ababa. Arbitrarydetentions have also been a major concern prior to and following national orlocal elections in 2005, 2008, and 2010.[13]Since the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Law dozens ofindividuals, including journalists, opposition members, and protesters, havebeen detained under the law.[14] Atleast 13 journalists have been charged under the Anti-Terrorism Law since 2011,11 of whom were sentenced under the law.[15]Torture and Ill-Treatment in DetentionArbitrary detention in Ethiopia is often incommunicado and accompaniedby torture and other ill-treatment and dire detention conditions.[16]Over the past decade Human Rights Watch has documented tortureand ill-treatment—specifically cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment orpunishment—in federal prisons, police stations, military camps, and knownand secret detention facilities.[17] Theperpetrators range from rural militia acting at the behest of localadministrators, to high-level officials at the federal and state level.[18]Methods of physical torture and ill-treatment vary andinclude beatings with sticks, electric cables, rifle butts, iron bars, or otherhard instruments; immersing individuals’ heads in water; beating andkicking people while they hang upside down; tying bottles of water to men’stesticles; and forcing detainees to run or crawl over sharp gravel for severalhours at a time.[19]In 2010 the UN Committee against Torture in its conclusionsabout Ethiopia’s compliance with the Convention against Torture and OtherCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, said that it “wasdeeply concerned about numerous, ongoing, and consistent allegations concerningthe routine use of torture by police, prison officers, and other members of thesecurity forces, as well as the military,”[20]to punish a spectrum of perceived dissenters, including university students andpeaceful protesters, members of political opposition groups, and allegedsupporters of insurgent groups, as well as alleged terrorist suspects.The Committee against Torture underlined the involvement ofhigh-level officials in the ill-treatment and torture of detainees andprisoners, noting that “such acts frequently occur with theparticipation, at the instigation or with the consent of commanding officers inpolice stations, detention centres, federal prisons, military bases and inunofficial or secret places of detention.”[21]The committee also noted that torture is commonly used during interrogation to“extract confessions when the suspect is deprived of fundamental legalsafeguards, in particular access to legal counsel.”[22]II. National and International Legal FrameworkEthiopia is party to international and regional treatiesthat impose legal obligations regarding the treatment of detainees and theconduct of law enforcement personnel. These include the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),[23] theConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment orPunishment (Convention against Torture),[24] and theAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR).[25]These treaties prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, and theuse of torture and other ill-treatment. They uphold the right of detainees tobe held in humane conditions and treated with dignity. Detainees also have theright to due process and a fair trial, including the right not to be compelledto confess to guilt or testify against themselves.The Convention againstTorture defines torture as “any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for suchpurposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession …or intimidating or coercing him or a third person … when such pain orsuffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent oracquiescence of a public official.”[26]International law prohibits anyone from being compelled totestify against themselves or to confess guilt.[27]States are obligated to ensure that any statement “made as a result oftorture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against aperson accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.”[28]The UN Human Rights Committee, the independent expert body that monitorscompliance with the ICCPR, stated in its General Comment 32 on the right to afair trial, that “In cases ofa claim that evidence was obtained in violation of [the prohibition againsttorture and other ill-treatment], information about the circumstances in whichsuch evidence was obtained must be made available to allow an assessment ofsuch a claim.”[29]The Ethiopian constitution includes safeguards for personsin custody, including in pre-trial detention. Article 19 sets out that a persontaken into custody must be brought before a court within 48 hours and informed,in a language they understand, of the reasons for their arrest.[30]Article 21 states that detainees are entitled to have access to family members,a lawyer, and a doctor.[31] The FederalPolice Commission Establishment Proclamation of 2011 also prohibits the use of“inhumane or degrading treatment or act” by federal policeofficials.[32]At the same time, Ethiopian legislation contains significantgaps that weaken protections against torture and other ill-treatment. In 2010the Committee against Torture raised concerns that the existing definition of“improper methods”[33] in the 2004Criminal Code fell short of the definition of torture under the Conventionagainst Torture, and urged revisions in the code.[34]Although international lawdoes not impose specific limits on the length of time a person may be heldbefore being charged, requiring that it be done “promptly,”[35] any prolonged period would be contrary to human rightsstandards. The Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code, in the process of revisionaccording to the draft National Human Rights Action plan seen by Human RightsWatch, currently allows for the police conducting an investigation to seekrepeated remand detentions of up to 14 days.[36]Since 2011 a significant number of the individuals detainedin Maekelawi have been investigated—and eventually charged and convicted—underthe 2009 Anti-Terrorism Law. In addition to Human Rights Watch, the Committee againstTorture and the Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights haveexpressed concern that provisions of the Ethiopian Anti-Terrorism Lawcontravene human rights standards.[37]The law permits individuals to be held up to four months inpre-charge detention, one of the longest pre-charge detention periods in theworld.[38] The lawalso permits the use of hearsay or “indirect evidences” in courtwithout any limitation.[39] Itallows the admission of official intelligence reports without disclosing thesource of the information or how it was gathered which effectively allowsevidence obtained under torture to be used.[40]Similarly it allows for the admissibility of confessions without prohibitingthe use of confessions made under torture.[41]III. Federal Police Crime Investigation Sector:MaekelawiThe Federal Police Crime Investigation Sector, commonlyknown as Maekelawi, is a federal police station located in Ethiopia’scapital, Addis Ababa. Maekelawi has been used by successive governments as adetention facility for those under investigation for serious crimes. Under the dictatorshipof Mengistu Haile Mariam, thousands of political prisoners were detained there.[42]Maekelawi is under the authority of the federal police, whichis mandated to address crime related to state security and “institutionsof the Federal Government.”[43] The federalpolice report to the Federal Police Commissioner who in turn reports to theMinistry of Federal Affairs.[44] Publicprosecutors reportedly also have offices at Maekelawi.[45]Over the last decade, many of those arrested in Addis Ababaand detained on politically motivated charges have initially been held inMaekelawi; if charged, most are then transferred to regular prisons, such asKaliti prison in Addis Ababa. Members of the political opposition, journalists,and civil society activists arrested following the contested 2005 electionswere detained in Maekelawi until they were charged.[46]More recently, political detainees including journalists, oppositionpoliticians, and students investigated for offenses under the Anti-Terrorism Lawhave been detained in Maekelawi during lengthy pre-charge detentions.High-profile detainees held in Maekelawi on politically motivatedcharges during the period covered in this report include:Membersof registered opposition parties: Bekele Gerba, deputy chairman of theopposition Oromo Federal Democratic Movement (OFDM); Olbana Lelissa, aspokesman for the Oromo People’s Congress (OPC); Zerihun Gebre-Egzabiherof the Ethiopian National Democratic Party; Andualem Aragie and NathnaelMekonnen Gebre Kidan, members of Unity for Democracy and Justice (UDJ); andopposition member and actor Debebe Eshetu.[47]Journalists:Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson, Swedish freelancers;[48]Reeyot Alemu of thenow-defunct Feteh newspaper; Woubshet Taye of the now defunct AwrambaTimes;[49]Eskinder Nega,a freelancer and blogger; and Yusuf Getachew and Solomon Kebede of the nowdefunct magazine Yemuslimoch Guday.[50]Dozensof prominent members of the Muslim community linked to the Muslim protests, includingnine members of the committee set up by a section of the Muslim community torepresent them in discussions with government.[51]With the exceptions of Bekele and Olbana, all theseindividuals were detained in Maekelawi under the Anti-Terrorism Law’slengthy remand detention period.[52] Theseare evidently only a handful of high-profile cases; dozens of other politicaldetainees have been held in Maekelawi in this period, particularly Oromos, whohave received no publicity and whose fate is unknown.Layout of MaekelawiMaekelawi has four central detention blocks, each with anickname.[53] Detaineesrefer to one notorious section as “Chalama Bet” (literally “darkhouse” in Amharic), also known as “Siberia” or “theunderground section.” The second detention block is known as “TawlaBet” (“wooden house,” named after the flooring). There is a thirdblock for women and a fourth block known as “Sheraton” (after the luxuryhotel with a location in Addis Ababa). There are also separate offices wheresuspects are taken for interrogation, mostly at night.Conditions of detention and treatment of detainees differ dependingon the section in which they are held. Maekelawi officials use the differentconditions as a form of exerting pressure on detainees, but also on occasionfor rewarding them. Detainees are often moved from one to another as theirinterrogation process progresses. Little public information is available onMaekelawi’s facilities.Chalama BetFormer detainees told Human Rights Watch that the ChalamaBet section is reached through a large metal door with guards, followed by acouple of stairs. There are 10 cells in Chalama Bet, including a toilet, towhich access is on occasion limited. The cells are lined along a corridor—fivecells on each side—with fluorescent lights running along it.[54]The Ministry for Federal Affairs, in its reponse to HumanRights Watch’s letter, said that there is no solitary confinment orsolitary confinment cells in Maekelawi.[55] Formerdetainees described to Human Rights Watch both communal and individual cells—thelatter to keep detainees in solitary confinement. Three detainees held inMaekelawi since 2011 said that cell number 8 is used for solitary confinementand is divided into at least four individual cells.[56]The individual cells are extremely narrow: detainees describe being forced tosit without sufficient space to stretch their legs out.[57]The cells are windowless and light only seeps in when both the door to the celland to the corridor are open.[58] B.G.,an Oromo student who was detained for eight days in cell number 8 in mid-2011, describedthe cell:This cell is partitioned into four others. I was in 8.2[numbered as such], so they can identify the prisoners. There were four roomswith four people. They were very dark and narrow. The cell was made up ofstones with a door and window of metal, there are no holes, and it is totally dark.These cells were only for the people they want to hurt more. There is no spacefor two people in these cells. I could only sit down and I could not stretchout. There is no toilet—you use the cell as a toilet.[59]The other cells in Chalama Bet are slightly larger and usedas communal cells. The size of these cells reportedly varies as does the numberof detainees they hold.[60] Formerdetainees described being held with between 2 and 20 other detainees.[61]The cells lack natural light but have a small vent above the metal door of thecell through which the corridor light dimly seeps in.[62]Two former detainees said that one of the cells, closest to the entrance andthe guard post, has a window.[63]Tawla BetTawla Bet is made up of five cells with metal doors. Formerdetainees held in this section told Human Rights Watch they were either held inisolation or with up to two other detainees. One was held with nine otherpeople.[64] Twoformer detainees described the last cell as being particularly small.[65]The floors of the cells are made of wood and the walls of concrete.[66]Former detainees described a small opening in the cell doors; some said theopening was covered with cardboard.[67] Somecell doors are shut continuously while others are open.[68]Former detainees held in Tawla Bet complained that their cells were infestedwith fleas.[69]Women’s CellHuman Rights Watch did not interview any women detained inthis section but spoke to several individuals held in Tawla Bet—facingthe women’s section—that described the cell as overcrowded. Thedoors to the women’s cells are open during the day and women have morefreedom to circulate.[70] Womenare on occasion held in other sections. Reeyot Alemu, a female Ethiopianjournalist charged and later sentenced under the Anti-Terrorism Law, was reportedlyheld alone for several days in the small cell in Tawla Bet in 2011.[71]Next to the women’s cells and across from Tawla Bet are the toilets andshower area for prisoners detained in these two sections, a small clinic, and asmall laboratory.[72] Inbetween there is a small courtyard where detainees are taken for air.“Sheraton”Detainees are generally transferred to “Sheraton”once their interrogations are finished, although some people interviewed byHuman Rights Watch were occasionally questioned even after their transfer tothis section.[73] Individualsunder investigation for financial crimes and non-political crimes arereportedly held here. Former detainees say it is made up of at least 12 cells thatare very crowded, but guards permit greater freedom to move around and socialize.[74]When the cells are open—between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.—detainees areallowed to meet with relatives. One detainee who was held for two days in TawlaBet described the transfer to “Sheraton” as “like moving fromslums to a five-star hotel.”[75]Interrogation RoomsInterrogations take place in offices, not in the detentioncells. Some of the offices used for interrogation are above Tawla Bet.[76]Others are on the first floor of a building found alongside the main parkingarea, near the administration offices. There are several investigation unitsincluding an anti-terrorism unit, a special investigations unit, a financialcrimes unit, a forensic unit, and a technology unit as well as an administrationsection where detainees are fingerprinted upon arrival. Two former detaineesdescribed one interrogation room having a big water container in the middle ofthe room that was used to ill-treat and torture detainees.[77]Human Rights Watch was not able to determine the location of this room.IV. Abuses in MaekelawiFormer detainees held in Maekelawi since 2010 described arange of abuses by officials, mostly police investigators. These abuses includebeatings, prolonged stress positions and exposure to cold, and harsh detentionconditions to elicit confessions, gather information, and to compel detaineesto testify against others.Torture and Ill-treatmentFormer detainees repeatedly described to Human Rights Watch themethods of torture and other ill-treatment inflicted on them and others by Maekelawistaff. They said that torture occurs mainly at the early stages of detention andoften during the night. Torture and ill-treatment is used both to extractinformation and force confessions, but also as a form of punishment for failureto comply with the investigators demands.TortureHuman Rights Watch documented the use of various torturemethods, which were almost exclusively used during interrogations. Severaldetainees explained that their physical mistreatment corresponded with theirperiod of investigation, and often with their period of solitary confinementand detention in Chalama Bet. Methods documented include:Punching, slapping, and kickingBeatings with objects (sticks,gun butts, electric wires)Beating the victim on thesoles of the feet with an objectStress positions, includingwith hands and legs tied together, or standing up with hands tied up aboveheadHanging the victim from theceiling by the wrists by handcuffs so that the toes barely touch theground, putting enormous pressure on the victim’s wristsExposure to cold particularly by having cold water pouredover the victim, which was often followed by whipping.Beatings are the most common form of abuse in Maekelawi.Police investigators and others involved in interrogations repeatedly beatdetainees with various objects including metal sticks, batons, gun butts, andelectric wires often during several sessions and days of interrogations.[78]Two former detainees told Human Rights Watch that they continue to haveproblems with their eyes, which they believe was a result of the prolongedbeatings.[79]Police investigators also often slap detainees duringinterrogations. A journalist held in 2011 described his first interrogationafter one night in a dark cell alone:Two police burst open the door and the light came in. Onetook my left arm and one took my right arm and I was taken to another room witha table and chairs. Another official was there. He was initially polite andasked me to sit. Everything he asked was untrue. I kept saying “I knownothing of what you are saying” and then he turned into a bad guy. Heslapped me, it was painful, and told me if I didn’t cooperate they willuse any treatment to make me speak. If I had known anything I was very willingto tell them but I didn’t.[80]Former detainees also described being kicked with militaryboots. A former detainee told Human Rights Watch, “They kicked me in my mouth with a boot and I lost fourteeth;” he still has a gap in his upper jaw where the teeth aremissing.[81]Several former detainees with whom Human Rights Watch spoke describedbeing handcuffed and hung from the ceiling or wall by a wrist and kept in thisposition for periods between one hour to a whole day.[82]One described having to stand on his tiptoes to release the pressure on hiswrist.[83]Most of the former detainees said they were questioned,slapped, and also whipped while suspended.[84] L.V.,an Oromo student held in Maekelawi in 2012, said his hand was broken when hewas beaten on his hand while being held in this position and that over a yearlater his hand continues to hurt:In the interrogation room there was small piece of metal onthe wall. They put me on it and locked my left hand to the wall and then mylegs didn’t touch the ground. They beat me on my left hand. I think I wasthere one hour, but I don’t know as I lost my memory.[85]Several former detainees told Human Rights Watch they werebeaten on the soles of their feet, most often while their hands and knees weretied together and elevated in front of them, with a baton behind their knees,[86]or while being hung from the ceiling with their hands and knees tied together.[87]Water was often poured over them prior to or while their feet were beaten. M.I.,a journalist held in Maekelawi in 2012, described his torture:They took off my shoes and socks and put a stick behind myknees and rolled me over and started hitting the soles of my feet. I was cryingvery much and they were putting cold water on my feet and then hitting me witha wet stick. It’s difficult to express the pain and what you read ontheir faces when they are hitting you—they laugh when you cry.[88]Three former detainees held in Maekelawi said they were hungfrom the wall.[89]Two said this happened in an interrogationroom that had a container of water in it, that the investigators used totorture them with. B.G. said:There was water in the room. It smelled. I was blindfoldedthe whole time I was there. They hung me in that room for 24 hours. They tiedmy legs and hands together. They had tightened the handcuffs even more thanusual, my hands and legs were tied together behind my back. My head wasdownwards. It was a very difficult position. You didn’t eat anything otherwiseyou would vomit. They whipped my inner feet…. This is not the way humanbeings treat each other.[90]Formerdetainees also described being exposed to very cold temperatures including byhaving cold water poured over them,[91] butalso because their cells and certain investigation rooms were very cold.[92]Nathnael Mekonnen Gebre Kidan, a prominent member of the opposition Unity forDemocracy and Justice (UDJ) party, who was charged and sentenced in 2012 underthe Anti-Terrorism Law, alleged in court on October 8, 2011, of having beentortured for 23 days in Maekelawi, including being beaten, forced to stand forhours upon end, deprived of sleep, and having cold water repeatedly poured overhim.[93]Other Ill-treatmentDetainees in Maekelawi are also subjected to other forms of ill-treatmentduring the investigation process, including verbal abuse and threats, prolongedhandcuffing, and incommunicado detention and solitary confinement.[94]Along with the methods of torture described above, these abuses exertsignificant physical and mental pressure on detainees and often influence theirresponse to interrogations.Verbal ThreatsPolice investigators threaten detainees at Maekelawi duringinterrogations. Numerous detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that investigators,including senior investigators such as Deputy Commander Teklay Mebrhatu, headof the Anti-Terrorism Crimes Investigation Department, and a “Colonel Reta,”[95]threatened them, including with death threats.[96]Investigatorswarn detainees, who do not have counsel present, that they have evidence toconvict them and imprison them for life and so they should confess rather thansuffer more.[97] Onesaid he was branded a terrorist.[98] Incertain instances investigators threaten detainees with death when seeking toextract information, get detainees to sign documents, or to confess.[99]A man detained in late 2012 said that when he asked about the content of adocument that investigators wanted him to sign one night, they threatened himsaying, “We would have the right to kill you even.”[100]Two former detainees said investigators threatened to arresttheir family members, which made them especially anxious.[101]One former detainee of Tawla Bet, which is located beneath some of theinvestigation rooms, told Human Rights Watch:At night I would hear the cries and shouts and at the timethey were threatening to put my whole family in prison. My worries every nightwere that they might have brought them and were keeping them somewhere.[102]Prolonged HandcuffingInternational standards provide that restraints should notbe applied as punishment; they should only be a “temporary controlmeasure, and not used any longer than is strictly necessary.[103]The Ministry for Federal Affairs said in its September 10 letter to HumanRights Watch that “as a rule suspects are only handcuffed depending onthe gravity of crime they are accused of and in the instance of violentdispensation and during transportation.”[104]Several detainees held in isolation cells in Chalama Bet described beinghandcuffed for prolonged periods of time, not only in transit and duringinterrogations but also while in their cells.[105] L.V.,who was handcuffed for five months in Chalama Bet, explained the difficulty hefaced as a result:My hands were chained behind my back. When I wanted tostand up it was hard: I had to use my head, legs, and the walls to stand up. Iwas still chained when I was eating. They would chain my hands in front of mewhile I ate and then chain them behind me again afterwards. It was also verydifficult to remove my trousers when I went to the toilet.[106]Solitary ConfinementProlonged solitary confinement is ill-treatment and mayamount to torture, and facilitates abuse.[107] While theMinister of Federal Affairs rejected claims regarding the use of solitaryconfinment in Maekelawi, some detainees told Human Rights Watch they were heldin isolation during the initial phase of their investigation in Chalama Bet andin Tawla Bet. Former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that theyhad been held from a few days to up five months in solitary confinement. Someonly saw guards or police investigators during this period.[108]Several high-profile individuals held under the Anti-Terrorism Law inMaekelawi, including Reeyot Alemu and Yusuf Getachew among others, wereinitially held in isolation.[109]Arbitrary DetentionThe authorities subject detainees in Maekelawi torestrictions that amount to arbitrary detention, including by holding themincommunicado and in prolonged pre-trial detention without charges.Incommunicado Detention and Access to Family andLegal CounselMaekelawi detainees are regularly held incommunicado anddenied access to a lawyer and family members. International norms and Ethiopianlegislation emphasize that defendants should be able to communicate with theirfamilies and have the right to consult directly and promptly with a lawyer. Incommunicadodetention places individuals at greater risk of torture and other ill-treatment.This is compounded by the lack of independent, unannounced, and regularmonitoring visits. Excessive restrictions on access by family members exertadditional psychological pressure on detainees.Access to detainees in certain sections of Maekelawi is morerestricted than in others, with one exception: all detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch were denied access to their family or lawyers while held inChalama Bet. Access to those held in Sheraton is reportedly regular, even daily.Since 2011, detainees held in Maekelawi under the Anti-TerrorismLaw have systematically been denied access to their families in the initialweeks of their detention. The wife of an opposition politician held under the Anti-TerrorismLaw told Human Rights Watch she was only allowed to visit her husband after 15days; the wife of another political detainee received a call after three weeks“just saying I could visit him.”[110]Guards outside Maekelawi sometimes acknowledge the presenceof a detainee and allow relatives to drop off food, water, and other provisions,but prevent relatives from actually meeting the detainees.[111]At least six former detainees told Human Rights Watch that their families didnot know about their whereabouts throughout their detention at Maekelawi.[112]Restrictions on access of detainees to their families oftencorresponds with the main investigation phase.[113]Several relatives of individuals recently charged under the Anti-Terrorism Lawtold Human Rights Watch that they were able to access their relatives only onceinterrogations had ended.[114] Thewife of one man held in mid-2012 told Human Rights Watch that she went toMaekelawi every day for three weeks to bring her husband food but was told eachtime that he was “under investigation and so could not see him.”[115]Access to legal counsel is also severely restricted inMaekelawi. The presence of a lawyer during interrogations is a standardsafeguard against abuse. None of the individuals interviewed by Human RightsWatch were in the presence of a lawyer during their interrogations. Twenty-nineMuslim protest leaders held under the Anti-Terrorism Law in Maekelawi inmid-2012 spent several weeks without access to their legal counsel.[116]The lawyers’ of the protest leaders repeatedly requested access to theirclients but Maekelawi officials denied them access until the interrogations hadfinished.[117]Prolonged Pre-chargeDetentionInternational law requires that anyone arrested shall bepromptly brought before a judicial authority and informed of any charges.[118]The Ethiopian constitution specifies that a person taken into custody must bebrought before a court within 48 hours and informed of the reasons for theirarrest.[119]At least 12 of the former detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch said that they did not know the charges for which they were beingheld or had never been officially charged. Several were never brought before acourt. Of those that had been charged, at least six were released on bail,[120]and five others were released on informal conditions after having spent betweenbetween three months and over a year in detention.[121]Harsh Detention ConditionsStandards on detention condition are set out in the UNStandard Minimum Rules on the Treatment of Prisoners.[122]Poor detention conditions, including lack of adequate sanitary provisions, light,and fresh air, are recognized as cruel, inhuman, and degrading.[123]The deliberate use of poor detention conditions by officials to extractinformation or coerce confessions can also amount to torture.[124]Detainees are generally held in the worse detention blocksat the beginning of their investigations, some are then moved as theirinvestigation “progresses,” and notably once they are charged, and othersare kept in the same block throughout their detention. In addition to using thealready dire prison conditions to exert pressure on detainees, in Chalama andTawla Bet prison officials also place restrictions on their access to basicamenities.Limited Sanitary Facilities and Restricted AccessAccess to toilets is restricted for many detainees,particularly in Chalama Bet and Tawla Bet. In Chalama Bet detainees are allowedto use the toilet once and sometimes twice a day; they often have to urinateinside their cells in plastic bottles or buckets. Those held in isolation cellsoften complained about the awful smell in their cell. Several former detaineesdescribed access as depending on the whim of the guards. L. V. linked his accessto a toilet with the stage in his interrogation:I was only allowed to use the toilet once a day, althoughafter two or three months, I was allowed twice. This is because at first, you area new arrival, everything is worse. They investigate, investigate, punish, theywant to get something, and either they get some evidence or they don’tand then they start showing kindness.[125]In Tawla Bet detainees are generally brought out to thebathrooms twice a day, around 6 a.m. and then again at 6 p.m., when the cells—thatare open during the day—are shut for the night.There are significant health risks associated with limitedaccess to sanitary facilities and being detained in unhygienic conditions. Itmakes detainees more vulnerable to illness and disease, for which they areunlikely to receive adequate treatment. This in turn evidently also influencestheir decision making and mental well-being.Lack of Air, Daylight, and FoodAccess to sunlight and fresh air also largely depends on thesection within Maekelawi in which a person is detained and the phase in anindividual’s detention.A number of individuals detained in individual cells inChalama Bet said they were held in their cells for 24 hours a day, in completedarkness, only taken out for interrogations, for periods of a few days to aslong as five months.[126] Oneformer detainee held for 43 days in Chalama Bet—8 of which were spent insolitary confinement—said he had been permitted to leave the section fora few minutes on four occasions over the course of 35 days.In the Tawla Bet block, cell doors are generally left open;however, some detainees told Human Rights Watch that their cell door was kept closed.[127]Access to the courtyard in front of the cells is restricted: most detainees areallowed out on a daily basis for approximately 15 minutes, some were allowedout twice a day as their case and investigation progressed.[128]Access to the yard is monitored and detainees are allowed out of their cell onecell at a time. Women held in the women’s block are reportedly much freerto move around in the yard.[129]Former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch often reportedbeing deprived of proper food—a commonly described meal was bread and teain the morning and a small piece of poor qualityinjeera (traditional flatbread) and shiro (chickpea sauce) atlunch and in the evening. Detainees complained both about the quantity andquality of the food they were served; one detainee said the injeera tastedof “sand.”[130] Several detainees complained of upset stomachs anddiarrhea, which they attributed to unclean conditions or poorly prepared food.Detainees who have access to their families or whose familymembers are allowed to deliver food are fortunate and said they relied solelyon this for basic provisions.Detainees said they were denied access to adequate medicalcare. Even those who had been seen by the nurses from Maekelawi’s clinic,including for injuries as a result of beatings and physical mistreatment duringinterrogations, complained about insufficient treatment and limited medication.[131]A handful of former detainees severely injured during interrogations reportedbeing taken to a police hospital.[132]Given the lack ofventilation, unhygienic conditions, poor sanitation, and poor nutrition, it isnot surprising that several detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch spokeof some ailment. These conditions ultimately affect detainees’ decisionmaking and judgment.Objectives of InterrogationsMistreatment and denial of access to basic services inMaekelawi are used to put pressure on detainees and extract information,confessions, and statements, and to compel them to testify against others. Suchstatements are on occasion used to pressure individuals after release or as“evidence” in court. Ill-treatment and torture are also used topunish detainees who refuse to “cooperate” during interrogations.One former detainee described how his investigators obtainedhis confession:They tied my legs with my hands and put something betweenthem. Then we left room 37 and they took me to a room near the cafeteria. In theroom there is water. It’s all ready. They opened water on my back. Icould not shout or talk. They said if you want to answer the questions, make asign with your finger, they opened water, beat me on the feet as my feet are upin the air and my head was on the ground. I hated myself. The water was pouringand I was thinking, I am going to die. I showed a sign, just to be able to getsome air, then the men stopped the water. I said to them, I felt like I amgoing to die. I think I stayed approximately 20 minutes, when they finishedthat punishment they took me to my cell.[133]Under international humanrights law, no one may be compelled to testify against themselves, to confessguilt, or be compelled to testify against others.[134]Standards drawn from the prohibitions against torture and other ill-treatmentset out in international treaties can be found in the UN Principles on the Protection ofAll Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment. Theprinciples provide that authorities may not take “undue advantage of thesituation of a detained or imprisoned person for the purpose of compelling himto confess, to incriminate himself otherwise or to testify against any otherperson.”[135] Moreover, authorities may not use violence, threats,and other interrogation methods that undermine detainees’ decision-makingprocess and judgment.[136]The Ethiopian constitution bars the use of statementsobtained through coercion.[137]The Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code states that noperson summoned shall be compelled to answer,[138] and prevents use of threats duringexaminations and restricts out-of-court testimonies.[139]However, the procedure code contains only limited provisions regarding theadmissibility and exclusion of evidence, giving judges significant discretionon these issues.Forced Confessions and StatementsSeveral former detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watchallege that police investigators coerced them to write or sign confessions orother documents, sometimes under duress and while being beaten or threatenedwith further violence.[140]According to Martin Schibbye, a Swedish journalist held inMaekelawi in 2011:For most people in Maekelawi, they keep them until theygive up and confess, you can spend three weeks with no interviews, it’sjust waiting for a confession, it’s all built around confession. Policesay it will be sorted in court, but nothing will be sorted out in court.[141]Detainees told Human Rights Watch that they were coerced toconfess to actions and crimes they said they had not committed, very often beingaccused of anti-state or anti-government actions, or having to declare that ifthey joined any form of opposition group in the future they would face severeconsequences.[142] Asignificant number of the 29 Muslim protest committee leaders held in Maekelawiin 2012 were reportedly pressured into signing documents admitting to actionsthey had not committed.[143]Human Rights Watch received crediblereports that at least three of the Muslim detainees were badly beaten andthreatened into signing a confession in which they allegedly admitted tocarrying out criminal activities.[144]In unedited footage taken of Abubekar Ahmed, an imam andchair of the Muslim protest committee, during his interrogation in Maekelawiseen by Human Rights Watch, he is subjected to lengthy questionning regardingthe long-term plans of the committee during which investigators repeatedly mockhis answers and try to wear him down.[145] Editedfootage of the interview was later broadcast by state-run Ethiopian Television(ETV) (see below).Investigators do not always provide or allow detainees toread the statement they are made to sign.[146]Several detainees said that when they refused to sign or questioned why theywere signing statements they were threatened or beaten.[147]L.V. said:They read it to me, it was already written, it was writtenon a computer. I refused to sign and they beat me. That day they put acondition for me: they said, “If you sign this paper you can go home andback to your studies, if you don’t we will show you.”[148]Statements appear to be almost exclusively in Amharic, alanguage some of the detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch could notunderstand.[149] SwedeJohan Perrson said:They demand that you sign Amharic statements, and I askedfor a translation. The big problem is all foreigners are asked to sign thingsin Amharic. If you question your statements later they say you’ve changedyour statement and you’re not trustworthy.[150]Detainees are also pressured to reveal their email and Facebookpasswords.[151] Onedetainee was beaten when he refused to sign an incriminating email:On the first day when I entered I gave them my email andpassword. There were no political emails in my account. But after three days anOLF [Oromo Liberation Front] statement was sent to me. They asked me about theemail and they told me to sign it, but I refused given that it was sent after Iwas in prison. They hit me before and after I refused to sign this email.[152]Investigators occasionally promise detainees that if theysigned statements they would be brought to court. Others were promised theywould be released.[153] Somedetainees told Human Rights Watch that they signed as a way to move on with theinvestigation process, or in the hope that their awful situation andmistreatment would end, and that they even might be released.[154]An Oromo technician detained in early 2012 who had been tortured and held insolitary confinement for three weeks told Human Rights Watch:After three weeks I decided I needed to give a falsestatement so that they would free me. I gave 18 names of people from [mycompany], false names, that I said were active agents of the OLF, and Ipromised to cooperate with them.[155]Confessions obtained during detention in Maekelawi have beenpresented as evidence in court in recent years. In 2011 in FederalProsecutor vs. Teshale Bekashi and others, in which members of theopposition Oromo Federal Democratic Movement and of the Oromo People’sCongress were accused of being members of the Oromo Liberation Front,[156]confessions were presented as evidence against 38 of the 69 defendants.[157]More recently, confessions signed by members of the Muslimprotest leaders while they were detained in Maekelawi have reportedly beenincluded as evidence within the charge sheet and in some instances presented incourt by the prosecution.[158]Upon their release from Maekelawi, in cases whereindividuals both have and have not been charged, detainees are sometimes madeto sign statements that include commitments never to take part in oppositionparties, or to cooperate with the authorities, including by providinginformation on supporters of opposition parties and banned insurgent groups. Certaindetainees, including several not charged, are also made to commit to burdensomereporting and restrictions on their movement once released and ostensibly notfacing prosecution.[159] Suchstatements create enormous pressure on the individuals, even after they arereleased, and a handful of detainees explained to Human Rights Watch that theirinability to “cooperate” upon their release, ongoing surveillance,and threats of renewed incarceration prompted theirflight from Ethiopia.[160]Similarly, high-profiledefendants in politically motivated cases, such as many of the oppositionpoliticians detained in 2005 and convicted of “treason,” have eventuallysigned pardons that included some admission of guilt, a strategy that was theonly avenue to obtain release after receiving life sentences after unfairtrials. The pardons are a potent means of threatening former detainees, asdemonstrated by the case of Birtukan Mideksa, who complained about the pardonprocess once released and was promptly re-arrested.[161]She was jailed for a further two years on the groundsthat she violated her pardon conditions, until finally released once again,when she left the country.In addition to signed“confessions,” high-profile individuals detained in Maekelawi underthe Anti-Terrorism Law have also been filmed during interrogations, clearlywithout their knowledge, and seemingly under duress. In February 2013 ETVbroadcast a program called “Jihadawi Harakat” (“JihadWar”) that included footage of Muslim committee members Abubekar Ahmed, KamilShemsu, Ahmed Mustafa, and Yassin Nuru, and activist Nuru Turki. The program characterizedthe Muslim protest movement in Ethiopia as Islamist extremist groups such asSomalia’s armed al-Shabaab militants, and cast the Muslim protest leadersas terrorists.Similarly, in November 2011,ETV broadcast a three-part program called “Akeldama” (“Landof Blood”) in which opposition party members Andualem Arage and NathnaelMekonnen were filmed in detention, describing their alleged involvement in whatthe documentary branded a “terrorist plot.” The interviews aredepicted in the programs as confessions.[162]Implicating False WitnessesIndividuals detained in Maekelawi are also on occasion pressuredinto testifying against others, particularly in political trials. A handful offormer detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch described fellow detaineesserving as witnesses against them, or said they shared a cell with individualswho were being “prepared” to serve as witnesses.[163]Zememu Molla, general secretary of the Ethiopian NationalDemocratic Party (ENDP), detained in September 2011 in Maekelawi along with UDJmember Nathnael Mekonnen and journalist Eskinder Nega, was initially held atMaekelawi and was released after testifying against Eskinder.[164]One man interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that he was coerced to be awitness against an acquaintance in an anti-terrorism trial.[165]Z.M., a journalist imprisoned in late 2011, found himself indetention with a health official from Gonder who had been asked to testifyagainst Nathnael Mekonnen:He [the health official] had been in Maekelawi about threemonths when I arrived. He had been told that if he wanted to be free he shouldtestify against him [Nathnael]. He told me that after two months, he hadaccepted. Prosecutors and detectives would come and tell him how to testify.[166]V. Government Response to MistreatmentThe Convention against Torture seeks not only to abolishtorture, but also to prevent torture or other forms of ill-treatment fromundermining the right to a fair trial. It sets out the right of individuals tocomplain to competent authorities about torture and to receive a prompt andimpartial investigation of their complaint, while protecting the complainantagainst reprisals.[167] It obligatesgovernments to regularly review interrogation rules, practices, and methods.[168]Police officers and investigators in Maekelawi havesignificant discretion in their treatment of detainees and suspects duringinvestigations. Checks and balances aimed at protecting detainees in Maekelawiare limited. Detainees held in Maekelawi are regularly denied access to basicavenues of redress, including a lawyer of their choosing or being broughtbefore a competent and independent judge.Some Ethiopian authorities recognize that the abuses atMaekelawi also occur in other Ethiopian detention facilities. Detentionconditions generally have been criticized by the Ethiopian Human RightsCommission in a past report,[169] andthe draft National Human Rights Action Plan 2013-2015 notes, even if onlyobliquely, that there is room for progress on issues such as the access ofdetainees in pre-charge detention to legal counsel, lengthy detentions pendingcompletion of police investigations, and the police duty to inform thosearrested of their right to remain silent.[170] The ActionPlan also mentions “the lack of health services, clean water for drinkingand sanitation, necessary provisions and congestion observed in someprisons.”[171]However, many of these concerns are described purely as acapacity problem, ascribed to lack of awareness or resources. Yet torture andother abuses of detainees held in Maekelawi cannot be addressed as a capacityissue alone; these are patterns of abuse that need to be recognized as serious humanrights violations and addressed from senior levels. Regrettably, the governmenthas dismissed serious human rights criticism as unreliable or politicallymotivated, and accountability for abuses by members of state security forces, whetherinside detention facilities or more generally, has been minimal tonon-existent.Judicial ResponseCourts have a responsibility to impartially hear and rule onallegations of torture and ill-treatment, including claims of coerced confessions.[172]Human Rights Watch has since 2005 expressed concerns about the lack ofindependence of the Ethiopian judiciary in politically motivated cases, particularlyin trials under the new Anti-Terrorism Law.Suspects held in Maekelawi are usually brought before theArada First Instance Court. This court has sometimes refused to hear complaintsof mistreatment from defendants during pre-charge hearings. For example, thefirst instance court hearing the charges against 29 Muslim protest leaders in 2012 told the defendants that they did not havethe jurisdiction to hear their complaints of mistreatment, which could only be raisedduring the trial.[173] Similarly, complaints of mistreatment and lack ofaccess to legal counsel during the remand period, in the trial of Woubshet Tayeand Zerihun Gebre-Egziabher, werenot investigated by the courts.[174]B.G., who was detained in Maekelawi under the Anti-TerrorismLaw, described the presiding judge’s response to his complaint:When I was taken to court I raised my hand to complainabout my treatment but the court refused to let me talk. The judge saidsomething about the law, that they were not going to actually hear the case andonly get a next appointment, as the case was still in the hands of the policeinvestigator, and so could only hear the police investigators.[175]Delaying investigations into claims of torture andill-treatment may not only prolong the abuse, it risks undermining an effectiveinvestigation and heightening the risk of evidence obtained under coercionbeing submitted as evidence by the prosecution.On other occasions when detainees held under the Anti-TerrorismLaw complained about incommunicado detention and mistreatment, the court orderedMaekelawi officials to grant access to detainees and called on the prisonofficials to stop mistreating the detainees but did not inquire further intothe allegations.Some detainees said they were fearful of speaking out incourt because of reprisals. One former detainee described how the experience ofothers who had spoken out in court convinced him to keep silent.[176]The wife of a political prisoner was informed by her husband’s lawyerthat after her husband complained in court about being mistreated, histreatment in Maekelawi actually worsened.[177] Thefact that detainees are regularly sent back to Maekelawi by the courts forlengthy investigation periods increases the risk of further ill-treatment whilediscouraging detainees from reporting abuse.[178]The courts have responded indifferent ways to complaints from detainees that their right to presumption ofinnocence was violated by the public broadcasting of footage of them beingquestioned under duress in Maekelawi. In the case of the “Akeldama”video broadcast on ETV, the court reportedly dismissed the complaints of dueprocess violations against the defendants on the grounds that the video footagewas not produced as evidence by the prosecutor.[179]In the case of the “Jihadawi Harakat” video,following a complaint by the defendants’ lawyers, the High Court grantedan injunction prohibiting the broadcast—but ETV ignored the court orderwithout sanction.[180]Restrictions on IndependentMonitoringThe repressive Charities and Societies Proclamation and the Anti-TerrorismLaw, through its lengthy remand periods and expanded police powers, havecontributed to the climate of impunity for government abuses by significantlyreducing independent human rights monitoring and basic legal safeguards againsttorture and ill-treatment in detention.The CSO Law, which prohibits nongovernmental organizationsreceiving more than 10 percent of their funding from foreign sources fromcarrying out human rights and governance work, has severely hampered the workof independent national human rights organizations.Access by independent monitors to detention facilities inEthiopia remains restricted. In 2007-2008, following reports of serious abusesin the Ogaden region, the government denied the reports, blocked access to theregion for journalists, and restricted access for humanitarian aidorganizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross—whichhad both humanitarian and protection monitoring programs in the region—andwas expelled from Somali region in July 2007.[181]The Human Rights Council (HRCO), an independentnongovernmental organization, has regularly requested access to Maekelawi overthe last two years but their requests have gone unanswered.[182]The authorities have also denied access to diplomats and UN entities. Requestsfrom relevant Special procedures of the UN Human Rights Council, including the UNSpecial Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatmentor punishment and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, to visit Ethiopiaremain outstanding.[183] InJuly 2013, members of a European Parliament human rights delegation were blockedfrom visiting Kaliti prison, despite initial assurances from the government.[184]The Ethiopian organization Justice for All-Prison FellowshipEthiopia (JFA-PFE) is granted access to certain prisons.[185]This group is one of the few Ethiopian nongovernmental organizations that hasbeen granted excemptions from the restrictions imposed by the CSO Law.[186]Monitoring Visits by Government BodiesHuman Rights Watch is aware of two government entities that havecarried out monitoring visits to Maekelawi, but these visits have been largelyineffective at curbing detainee abuse.According to the UN Body of Principles for the Protection ofAll Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, places of detentionshould be regularly visited by individuals that report to a competent authoritydistinct from the authority directly in charge of the administration of theplace of detention.[187] The principlesalso provide that detainees should be able to communicate freely and in fullconfidentiality with individuals carrying out visits.[188]Ethiopian HumanRights CommissionThe Ethiopian Human Rights Commission—agovernment-affiliated entity—has in recent years carried out monitoringactivities in federal and regional prisons.[189] A July2012 investigation into prison conditions by the commission found thatdetainees had been subjected to harsh disciplinary measures by fellow inmatesand beatings by security personnel, but it did not identify any cases ofill-treatment that would amount to torture.[190] The UNCommittee against Torture in its 2010 conclusions concerning Ethiopia raisedconcerns about the apparent lack of unannounced visits by the commission andthe authorities’ failure to implement the commission’s 2008 recommendations.[191]The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission has carried out three visitsto Maekelawi since 2010 and met specifically with detainees held under the Anti-TerrorismLaw.[192] In itsSeptember 9, 2013 response to Human Rights Watch, the commission stated thatits monitoring visits, including to Maekelawi, have been unannounced visits andthat they had faced no impediment in accessing Maekelawi.[193]In a media statement following a September 5, 2012 visit with detained Muslim communityleaders in Maekelawi, the commission raised concerns about the detainees’access to their families and legal counsel but said that otherwise theirdetention was lawful.[194] Maekelawiofficials were reportedly present when commission officials met with Muslimcommunity leaders in September 2012, undermining detainees’ willingnessto raise concerns about their mistreatment.[195]The commission did not say anything about allegations ofill-treatment and forced confessions during interrogations.[196]In its letter to Human Rights Watch the commission raised concerns aboutphysical and verbal assault of certain detainees when they were arrested.[197]The commission also met with Debebe Eshetu, Eskinder Nega,and Andualem Aragie in 2011 when they were in pre-charge detention inMaekelawi.[198] Onceagain officials from the commission were reportedly accompanied by Maekelawiofficials, which would have made open discussions about treatment impossible.[199]The commission did not meet with Nathnael Mekonnen, who had complained in courtof mistreatment during his interrogation.[200]Federal Police CommissionThe Federal Police Commission is also mandated to carry outinspections of detention facilities. Three of the detainees interviewed byHuman Rights Watch said that they were visited by Federal Police Commissionrepresentatives in 2011 and 2012[201] whilethey were in Sheraton and Chalama Bet.[202] Theirinspection visits and meetings with inmates take place with police investigatorspresent, minimizing their value.[203] One personwho had been held in isolation for almost three months complained about hismistreatment in a meeting with a visiting police commissioner, but said hisconcerns were ignored.[204]The intimidation of suspects and their families, the lack ofindependent monitoring, and the perception that that the federal police and theEthiopian Human Rights Commission are instruments of government policymilitates against their being able to credibly investigate abuses in Maekelawi andother detention facilities.AcknowledgmentsThis report was researched and written by Laetitia Bader,researcher in the Africa division.

In order for us to take your answersinto account in our forthcoming report, we would appreciate a written responseby September 11, 2013.Ourresearch is based on over 40 interviews with former recent detainees orrelatives of individuals detained in Maekelawi since 2010. Interviews withformer detainees were conducted on an individual basis, and interviewees wereidentified through a range of channels and sources.Ourresearch examined detention conditions and the treatment of detainees inMaekelawi from 2010 to the present. It documents how detainees have facedserious human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned aboutthe treatment of detainees during interrogations: detainees described how themost serious mistreatment, which in some cases amounted to torture, took placeduring interrogations in the presence of police interrogators.Theresearch documents that detention conditions in Maekelawi are particularlyharsh in two of the detention blocks: a building known as “ChalamaBet,” which is adjacent to the women’s cells, and one called“Tawla Bet,” which faces the clinic and laboratory. Our researchfound that individuals in these blocks face onerous restrictions on theiraccess to sanitary facilities and access to daylight and air. In addition,detainees face insufficient food and medical supplies.Detaineesin Maekelawi are regularly denied access to their relatives and legal counsel,particularly in the initial, pre-charge stages of their detention andinvestigation period. This increases the vulnerability of detainees tomistreatment and torture.Theresearch highlights the particularly abusive nature of the interrogationsconducted in Maekelawi. Our research indicates that police interrogators andothers involved in interrogations at Maekelawi use the following methods toextract information, statements and confessions:Beatings,slapping and kicking by police investigators;Sleepdeprivation;Stresspositions;Exposureto cold;Solitaryconfinement;Prolongedhandcuffing; andVerbalthreats and insults.Sometimesthe statements and confessions produced after detainees have been subjected tothese abuses are then used as evidence in court or as a means of exertingpressure on detainees once they are released.HumanRights Watch would appreciate your response to the concerns described above andto the following questions in order to reflect your views in our reporting.Howfrequently does the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission visit the Maekelawifacility? Has the Commission visited Maekelawi since September 2012? Has theCommission requested and been granted unrestricted access to all detentionblocks and to all individuals detained in the facility? Has the Commission everbeen denied access to Maekelawi or to specific individuals held there? If thecommission has not been granted access, on what basis was access denied? Hasthe Commission ever carried out an unannounced visit to Maekelawi?Whatother groups and entities other than the Commission are granted access toMaekelawi? Is this access unhindered and are visits unannounced?Since2011, there have been regular complaints of mistreatment during pre-charge andpre-trial detention in Maekelawi of individuals held under the 2009Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. Has the commission enjoyed unrestricted access tothese individuals during their periods of detention in Maekelawi, notablyduring the Commission’s September 5, 2012 visit?Howmany detainees did the Commission meet with during its September 5 visit? How werethese detainees identified? Were you able to meet with them in the absence ofprison officials?The findings outlinedin the press release following your September 5 visit do not matchour findings in terms of ill-treatment and torture of detainees duringpre-charge investigations. Could you please describe your methodology foryour visits to Maekelawi and other detention facilities?Inthe press release issued following the Commission’s visit to Maekelawi onSeptember 5, you raised concerns about limited access of detainees’ heldin connection with protests by sections of the Muslim community to theirfamilies and legal counsel during the initial detention phase of individuals.What measures has the Commission taken since this visit to ensure that itsrecommendations to the investigation officers regarding these specificdetainees were implemented and to ensure that more recent detainees were notheld incommunicado?Isthe Commission monitoring the trials of any individuals detained under theAnti-Terrorism Proclamation?Inaddition to concerns about restrictions on access to detainees, what othergeneral concerns about the conditions as well as the treatment of detainees inMaekelawi have you identified during recent visits?Hasthe Commission provided any human rights training or education to federalpolice and public prosecutors? If so, we would be grateful for further detailsof the dates and content of such trainings.Wewould appreciate receiving your response to this letter by September 11, 2013in order to ensure that it can be reflected in our final report. Please do nothesitate to send us any other materials or information that you think would berelevant for our understanding of these issues.Furthermore,I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you in person in Addisto discuss this research.YoursSincerely,LeslieLefkowDeputyDirector, Africa DivisionAnnex II: Response from Ambassador Teruneh Zenna toHuman Rights Watch’s Letter on MaekelawiSeptember 8, 2013Dear Leslie Lefkow,I have attached here with the reply to your questions, concerningthe condition and treatment of detainees in the Federal Police InvestigationSector.I would like to thank you for sharing with us the preliminaryfinding of research undertaken by Human Rights Watch into conditionand treatment of detainees at the Federal Police Crime Investigation Sector.Your statement that HRW is committed to produce material that is wellinformed and objective and that it wants to ensure that their report properlyreflect the views, policies, practices of the Governmentof Ethiopia and the institutional bodies such as The Ethiopian HumanRights Commission is very much appreciable.We realize that human rights and democracy are work in progressin developing countries such as Ethiopia. We will be verymuch glad to work with organisations like that of yours to contributeour humble share for the progress and betterment of human rights in thecountry. I for one believe that to fight human rights abuse we need to seek thetruth and speak for it.We have gone throughyour preliminary research findings and we noted thatthe methods you used and the conclusion you arrived at are differentthan those of ours. We have the luxury of focusing in one country andunchallenged rights to visit any detention centers in Ethiopia.While monitoring the detentions centers we use the UNminimum standrerds and while making a conclusion we try to makeit unquestionable. Because, we believe that for human rights commissions credibilityis the most strong tool with which they can fight any authority.We believe that through such exchange of notes we could learnfrom each other and improve our search for truth. We will be able topublish the condition and treatment of detainees very soon and give you thegeneral picture of detention centers in the country as wedid on prison condition a year ago.Please, do not hesitate to raise any question on our reply orfor that matter any other issues.With regards,Teruneh Zenna (Ambassador)Chief CommissionerEthiopian Human Rights CommissionClick to expand ImageClick to expand ImageClick to expand ImageClick to expand ImageClick to expand ImageClick to expand ImageAnnex III: HumanRights Watch Letter to Dr. Shiferaw Teklemariam on MaekelawiAugust12, 2013Dr.Shiferaw TeklemariamMinisterof Federal AffairsMinistryof Federal AffairsP.O.Box 5718AddisAbabaEthiopiaVia email:shiferawtmm@yahoo.comRE: Questions on MaekelawiDearMinister Shiferaw,Onbehalf of Human Rights Watch I am writing to you to share with you thepreliminary findings of research carried out by Human Rights Watch intoconditions and treatment of detainees at the Federal Police CrimeInvestigations Department, Maekelawi, in Addis Ababa.HumanRights Watch is committed to producing material that is well-informed andobjective and we want to ensure that our report properly reflects the views,policies, and practices of the government of Ethiopia and of institutionalhuman rights bodies such as the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.Wehope you or your staff will respond to the questions below so that your viewsare accurately reflected in our reporting.

Has anyone ever been convicted and ifso, who?Since2011, there have been numerous complaints of mistreatment during pre-charge andpre-trial detention in Maekelawi of individuals held under the 2009Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. Please describe the initiatives taken by thegovernment, including relevant law enforcement agencies including the FederalPolice Commission, the Ministry of Justice, or the Office of the PublicProsecutor, to investigate these complaints.

Are systematic records kept during interrogations in Maekelawi regardingthose police officers present, time and place of interrogation?Accordingto some former detainees, their access to food and water, medication, sanitaryservices and other essential goods was unreasonably restricted.

Your deliberate neglectof facts on the ground and predetermined conclusion on your presentationstrengthen your ideological bias rather than any concern on human rightssituation in the Crime Investigation Sector.Thereforms undertaken to ensure international standard treatment of detainees aswell as the efforts underway to improve the condition of the detentionfacilities; not to mention other positive measures that aim at ensuringcompliance with constitutional and treaty standards, have never been reflectedon your report.Similarly,we have found the lack of objectivity, transparency, visible presence andimpartiality in your ostensible investigation. It is also incongruent withinternational established principles and norms. All this bears out our readingof your report as a flawed exercise blemished by, among other things,ideologically driven series of attacks on Ethiopia’s accelerated growthand development.Inconsequence, your report neither provide precise or detailed informationsufficient to warrant local inquiries into the matter, nor does it disclose theprocess and criteria of selection of witnesses, the methodology employed toverify the validity of the allegations or the credibility of witnesses. Nor isthere relevant technical and medical evidences offered to support theallegation of human right violation in our Criminal Investigation Center.Thefederal Crime Investigation Department of Federal Police of the FederalDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia carries out its activities within the mandateof its operation set out by proclamation No. 720/2011.Theproclamation authorizes the federal police to initiate investigation over awide range of cases, including threats and acts of crime against human rights.It is also empowered to investigate, without prejudice to the powers and dutiesconferred on other federal government organs by other laws, crimes that fallunder the jurisdiction of the federal courts.Thepolice strictly adhere to evidence-based and prosecution led investigativeprocedures. Detention can only be made after thorough consultation with theduly designated prosecutors. Each and every arrest and investigation iseffected after through discussion with the office of the attorney generalregarding information gathered and evidences collected in each specific case.Investigative case-management is based on the criminal procedure code of thecountry with direct supervision of the prosecutor (s) assigned to supervise andguide the conduct of the case.Followingthe implementations of a recently introduced comprehensive police reformprogram, Department of Crime Investigation has introduced mechanisms oftransparency where by information regarding our essential services isaccessible to any person under detention. In 2010 new operational manuals wereintroduced to provide detailed procedural guidelines for criminalinvestigations. These operational manuals and codes of practices, apart fromensuring an effective police operations; serve as important management tools toenhance accountability in official police tasks. These internal procedures,inter alias, provide mechanisms to control officers’ conduct throughroutine supervision, regular performance evaluations, and investigations ofalleged misconducts. The introduction of these operational manuals and internalprocedures is primarily aimed at ensuring the observance of constitutional andtreaty obligations towards persons under police custody.Inadditions to external accountability procedures exercised by courts and otheroversight institutions at the federal level, these procedures are essential inassisting police officers to recognize and carry out their legal duties ofprotecting all persons against illegal acts, consistent with the high sense ofresponsibility that their profession requires. These rules oblige policeofficers to protect and respect the dignity and human rights of all detaineesand strictly prohibit torture or any other form of ill-treatments.Theseare our mechanisms that our legal system assures that police officers andlaw-enforcement agencies facilitate conditions consistent with the dignity andwell-being of persons under detention. A violation of these procedures not onlycarries internal disciplinary measures, but also entails serious criminalprosecution that could result in severe punishment.Inorder to guarantee the strict implementation of the operational manuals and toensure respect for human rights, our Federal Police Department of CrimeInvestigation conducts periodical researches to identify problems ofimplementation at the Crime Investigation Center. Accordingly actions ofcontinuous quality improvement are practiced in the center. Based on theseresearches and inputs obtained from consultative forum with stakeholders, wecontinuously provide on-job training on the need to adhere to human rightsprinciples in the course of discharging their responsibilities.Hence,all arrests are executed by the judiciary and no detention is immune fromjudicial supervision. No arrest takes place without notifying the person reasonfor arrest. Only in cases of resistance is the police allowed to resort toproportional force to the circumstance of the case. Suspects are always advisedabout their rights such as the right to remain silent, the right to be broughtto court within 48 hours, and the right to be granted bail. So that, nosuspected person is compelled to confess. Investigation is only conducted onthe bases of information and evidences gathered prior to arrest.Thepolice always observe the suspected person’s rights including the rightof presumption of innocence. No incommunicado detention is allowed under ourlegal system as every detainee is entitled to be visited and has communicationwith families, relatives, friends, religious councilors as well as legalcounsel.We,once again, would like to confirm to HRW or any other concerned body that thereis no solitary confinement where detainees are kept to procure information orconfession through coercion. The Crime Investigation Center doesn’t haveany solitary confinement chambers. All cells are provided with electric lightsas all detainees have access to medical service.Likewiseregular meals are provided by the detention center to all persons undercustody. As a rule suspects are only handcuffed depending on the gravity ofcrime they are accused of and in the instance of violent dispensation andduring transportation.Havingnoticed the gap on the required United Nations Human Rights InternationalStandards to undertake such investigation in any sovereign nation and ourfederal constitution and other instruments in place to ensure the observance ofstrict human rights; we would like to ensure you that our level best positiveattention is given to all issues you indicated on the enquiry.OurInternal review mechanism, complaint reporting options and personneldevelopment plans on Crime Investigation Sector ensures that international goodpractices prevail all the time. We would also like to inform you that we haverules and procedures to access our Crime Investigation Center, both for localand international actors; provided that such organs are not ideologicallydriven, neutral and come through legal channels. This is a practice observedeveryday and we have no record of denial provided that such independentorganizations are neutral enough and no other imminent motivation behind them.Onthe other hand as we indicated earlier specific responses cannot be provided toyour quires as they are ill defined and non case referenced. It is obvious thatthe methods employed, your researchers’ pool and sample of personsinterviewed will substantially undermine the validity and credibility of yourresults. Such confusing, baseless and unfounded allegations may come from anideological stand and attack on Ethiopia rather than genuine concern to improveHuman Rights status in our Crime Investigation Center or elsewhere. AnIndication of such act is that you have been generating a series of accusationson the commune program of Gambella and Southomo with the same groundlessfabrications aimed at undermining the accelerated growth and developmentefforts in these areas. The recent report by your linked institutions inSouthomo commune development program also verifies the same.
