On December 10, 1991 -- the annual anniversary of t he adoption of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights -- the Cairo-based Egyp tian Organization for Human 
Rights (EOHR) launched a one-year campaign against torture in Egypt.   
 
In its press release announcing the campaign, EOHR stated that torture "is an 
officially sanctioned policy in Egypt" and that sec urity forces use torture with 
impunity: 
 
 [T]he virtually absolute powers vested in the secu rity bodies 
during the past ten years of the operation of the e mergency law 
have given them an exceptional status, effectively placing them 
above the law and the judicial system itself.  This  has made 
those responsible for torture within these bodies s ecure 
against punishment. 
 
EOHR appealed to "people of conscience around the c ountry to join hands in a 
campaign to struggle -- using all peaceful means an d transcending all ideological 
and sectarian interests -- for the noble and humane  task of bringing an end to 
torture in Egypt." 
 
Middle East Watch applauds this goal, and by publis hing this report joins EOHR's 
campaign to eradicate torture in Egypt and secure j ustice for its victims.

 This report was written by Virginia N. Sherry, the  associate director of 
Middle East Watch.  It was edited by Kenneth Roth, deputy director of Human 
Rights Watch -- the parent organization of MEW -- a nd Andrew Whitley, executive 
director of MEW. 
 
 The report is based principally on information gat hered by Middle East 
Watch during a fact-finding mission to Egypt conduc ted from January 27 to 
February 22, 1992, by Ms. Sherry and John Valery Wh ite, a lawyer and Orville Schell 
Fellow at Human Rights Watch. The delegation travel ed to Alexandria, Assyut, 
Aswan, Cairo, Mansoura and Minya, and met with form er detainees, relatives of 
current and former detainees, lawyers, human rights  monitors, Egyptian and 
foreign journalists, physicians, university profess ors and students, current and 
former officers of the Ministry of Interior, diplom ats, and officials from 
international and regionwide organizations.  Ms. Sh erry and Mr. White also 
interviewed Chancellor Raga' el-Araby, Egypt's Pros ecutor General; Gen. 
Muhammed Abdel Halim Moussa, the Minister of Interi or; and Gen. Mahmoud 
Fakarani, the director of the Prisons Administratio n.  
 
 On the tenth day of this mission, Chancellor el-Ar aby informed the 
delegation that it would be able to visit and inspe ct Egyptian prisons, to which 
MEW had sought access since 1990.  MEW accepted the  invitation and, beginning 
on February 12, visited six prisons over an eight-d ay period: Abu Za`bal Liman, Tora 
Liman, Tora Istikbal, Tora Mazraa, Qanater women's prison and Tanta General 
Prison.  Some of the information obtained in interv iews with detainees and 
sentenced prisoners at these facilities is included  in this report. A separate MEW 
report on prison conditions in Egypt will be issued  later in 1992.   
 
 While MEW's prison visits were under way, Egyptian  daily newspapers --  
al-Ahram , al-Akhbar, al-Gomhuriyya  and al-Wafd  -- began to characterize MEW's 
observations and findings, often quoting Interior M inister Gen. Moussa, without 
contacting MEW representatives for comment.  To res pond publicly to 
misrepresentations that appeared in these newspaper s, MEW held a press 
conference in Cairo on February 22, at the conclusi on of the mission, to clarify the 
facts and release preliminary findings about arrest  and detention practices, 
torture and prison conditions in Egypt.  The writte n statement distributed by MEW  
 
 
 viii at this press conference was published in March 199 2.1

mission to Egypt in May 1990.  The participants wer e Andrew Whitley, on behalf of

Issue 3, March 1992.     INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTION    
    
    
 This report examines gross human-rights abuses in Egypt: torture and 
long-term detention without charge or trial.  It fo cuses particularly on the use of 
torture by officers and soldiers of the Ministry of  Interior's General Directorate for 
State Security Investigation (SSI) during the perio d when political and security 
suspects are held in incommunicado detention.  Seni or Egyptian officials have 
consistently denied that torture occurs. Interior M inister Gen. Muhammed Abdel 
Halim Moussa told Middle East Watch in February 199 2 that allegations of torture 
are "absolutely contrary to the truth."  Gen. Mouss a's denial echoed comments 
made two years earlier by Interior Ministry spokesm en for his predecessor, Gen. 
Zaki Badr.   
 
 Although this report deals only with torture by SS I, there is ample 
evidence that torture and the sub-culture of violen ce has pervaded ordinary 
police work. Compounding the problem, as this repor t indicates, is a lack of will by 
the Prosecutor General's office to fulfill its lega l obligation to investigate and 
prosecute such abuses, and the lack of effective in ternal police-control 
mechanisms. 
 
 The practices of torture and prolonged arbitrary d etention cannot be 
detached from the context in which they occur: the Egyptian people have been 
subjected to rule by exceptional or emergency law f or almost fifty years.  Martial 
law was declared in Egypt in September 1939, at the  outbreak of World War II, and 
states of exception have been in effect for all but  about six years since then.  
Emergency law has been imposed continuously since J une 1967, except between 
May 1980 and October 1981.  In May 1991, emergency law was extended for three 
more years. 
 
 One legacy of long-term exceptional law has been t he institutionalization 
of arbitrary arrest and detention powers by securit y forces.  A former high-ranking 
officer in the Ministry of Interior told MEW in Feb ruary 1992 that "under the 
emergency law, you can arrest someone, the court ca n object, and the Minister of 
Interior can still put him in jail.  People can be held for years." 
 
 The torture of political detainees by Egyptian sec urity forces has marred 
Egypt's history since the consolidation of power by  Gamal Abd el-Nasser after the 
1952 military coup. Under Nasser's charismatic and personalized rule, an 
authoritarian state emerged. Beginning in 1952, arm y officers were placed in 
"controlling positions" in the police apparatus and  "all police functions were     2 2 22    $$ $$    II IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION     
 
placed under the Ministry of Interior."1  A study of Egypt published by the U.S. 
government notes that "the tight political security  enforced under Nasser created 
a police state."2  The feared mukhabarat `amma  -- the internal-security police 
staffed by military officers -- detained and tortur ed perceived opponents with 
impunity.3 
 
 "The practice of torture originated in Nasser's da ys," one well-placed 
Egyptian lawyer  told MEW, and led to deaths in det ention.  "The people targeted 
were Muslim Brothers, communists, reactionaries...a nd then anyone the 
government didn't like."  President Anwar Sadat him self acknowledged the rise in 
human rights abuses in his autobiography:  
 
  In the first four years of revolutionary rule, 
when the Revolutionary Command Council 
wielded all power, there were mistakes and 
violations of human rights but these were 
rather limited in scope.  It was after 1956 that 
they began to acquire huge dimensions.4   
 
 
 After Nasser's death in September 1970, the secret -police system was 
reorganized by his successor, then-Vice President C ol. Sadat, giving rise to the 
Ministry of Interior's State Security Investigation  department. "Sadat removed the

     3"Nasser established a pervasive and oppressive inte rnal security apparatus.  The 
security police detained as many as 20,000 politica l prisoners at a time and discouraged 
public discussions or meetings that could be constr ued as unfriendly to the government.  
The security police recruited local informants to r eport on the activities and political views 
of their neighbors."  Egypt: A Country Study , p. 341.

army from secret-police functions and completely re organized the system," one 
knowledgeable Egyptian observer told MEW.   
 
 A presidential decree of July 1971 created general  departments within 
the Interior Ministry responsible for various polic e and security matters, 
including a department of State Security Investigat ion.5  The next month, Interior 
Minister Mamduh Salim announced additional changes,  including his direct 
supervision of the State Security Investigation dep artment, along with the 
departments of public relations and organization; s upervision of other 
departments in the Ministry were relegated to four deputy ministers.6  "Today, the 
mukhabarat `amma  is no longer in the business of human rights abuse s such as 
torture and arbitrary arrests and detention.  Now t his is essentially an SSI matter," 
a prominent Egyptian lawyer told MEW. 
 
 The use of torture subsided considerably during Pr esident Sadat's 
tenure from May 1971 to October 1981.  But Egyptian s from various political 
tendencies contend that since Hosni Mubarak assumed  the presidency after 
Sadat's October 1981 assassination, the internal-se curity apparatus, projecting 
itself as the defender of the state against a perce ived Islamist threat, has 
resurrected an exceedingly heavy hand.7  "Since Sadat's assassination, there has 
been a continuous fear that the fundamentalists wil l erupt. The security forces 
have been given a free hand and are using their pow er in disproportion to the 
threat," one secular Egyptian analyst told MEW. "I personally inspected prisoners 
in Tora Istikbal prison who were tortured," a forme r general in the Ministry of 
Interior said in an interview with MEW.  "I saw man y cases of torture, especially

     6Area Handbook for Egypt , p. 339.  
     7This view is reaffirmed by Amnesty International, w hich has monitored torture and other 
rights violations in Egypt for over two decades.  I n 1991, Amnesty reported: "While large-
scale political arrests...took place under state of  emergency provisions during the 1970s, 
reports of torture or ill-treatment which had been inflicted routinely in the 1960s, were 
rarely received by Amnesty International.  Since Oc tober 1981, however, the torture of 
political detainees has continued almost unabated."   ("Egypt: Ten Years of Torture," October 
1991, AI Index: MDE 12/18/91, p.1.)     4 4 44    $$ $$    II IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION     
 
after the Sadat assassination."8   
 
 Recent regional developments and Egypt's serious e conomic problems 
have served only to reinforce support for the secur ity forces' aggressive tactics 
against actual and perceived opponents of the gover nment.  The sweeping victory 
in Algeria of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the first round of parliamentary 
elections in December 19919 "is used as an example of why Egypt's approach 
against its own fundamentalists is working,"  one s enior Egyptian journalist told 
MEW.  At a public debate in January 1992, Interior Minister Gen. Moussa said that 
he would never permit an Islamist victory at the ba llot box.10 
 
 The government also is sensitive to possible expre ssions of popular 
discontent because of the consumer price increases that accompanied Egypt's 
1991 economic-reform agreements with the Internatio nal Monetary Fund.  In April 
and May 1991, new sales taxes, ranging from five to  thirty percent, and price 
increases of fourteen to sixty-six percent on elect ricity, gas and petroleum 
products, were imposed.11  Egyptian households, already financially beleague red, 
                                                                    
     8Five men were executed in April 1982 for direct inv olvement in the Sadat assassination. 
In addition, hundreds of suspected Islamic radicals  were arrested by security forces and 
put on trial in what became known as the al-Jihad c ase. "In September 1984, 174 of the 302 
people arrested in connection with Sadat's killing were acquitted of plotting to overthrow 
the Government; 16 were sentenced to hard labour fo r life; and the remainder received 
prison sentences ranging from two to 15 years."  Re gional Surveys of the World, The Middle 
East and North Africa 1992 , 38th Edition (Europa Publications Ltd., London: 1 991), p. 393.  
     9See  Middle East Watch, "Human Rights in Algeria Since the Halt of the Electoral Process," 
Vol. 4, No. 2, February 1992. 
     10"The FIS, he said, took advantage of a vacuum left by government mismanagement.  
`Such a chance does not exist for fundamentalist gr oups in Egypt because there is no such 
vacuum,' he said." (Max Rodenbeck, "Egyptian crocod ile tears,"  Middle East International , 
January 24, 1992, p. 5.) 
     11The sales taxes were introduced in May 1991 "on mos t goods and services (although 
certain basic items such as bread, meat, fish, petr ol and gas were exempted) .... Against this 
background, a new stand-by facility was formally ap proved by the IMF in mid-May 1991, 
under which some $372 [million] would be made avail able to Egypt over a period of 18 
months to provide balance-of-payments assistance fo r its economic reform programme."      I I IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION     $$ $$    55 55    
 
will become increasingly squeezed: 
 
  The greater underlying worry is the potential 
for unrest inherent in economic reforms.  
Already meagre, household incomes have 
barely kept pace with inflation, currently 
running at about 25 per cent, even as the 
government has imposed a ten per cent sales 
tax and continued to phase out subsidies on 
basic foods, energy and transport.  
Liberalisation -- and ultimately privatisation -
- of much of the state sector, which still 
accounts for most industrial output, will 
entail massive layoffs.12 
 
Organized labor is another area of concern for the government, as workers 
become restive:  "The trade union movement is becom ing active again -- there 
have been more strikes, especially in late 1991 and  early 1992," an Egyptian 
human rights monitor told MEW in February 1992.

 The renewed use of systematic torture by Ministry of Interior security 
forces during Hosni Mubarak's presidency was noted by Egyptian lawyer and 
human rights activist Nabeel el-Hilaly, who concise ly described the trends over a 
thirty-year period:  
 
  In 1959, I was subjected to torture and ill-
treatment in Abu Za`bal prison.  Throughout 
the 1960s, the practice of torture against 
political detainees, especially Muslim 
Brothers and communists, was widespread.

But since the end of the 1960s the brutality of 
the security forces began to lessen to a large 
extent.  One must admit that throughout the 
1970s torture did not occur but occasionally. 
 
  Unfortunately, after Sadat's assassination, 
torture of political detainees is once again 
taking place on a large scale, against 
religious and leftist elements.  Defendants in 
the Jihad case13 were subject to massive 
torture.  About eighty reports of medical 
examinations carried out on these detainees 
and presented to the court have proved that 
torture really occurred.  It is well known that 
eight of the detainees in this case have been 
tortured to death or died from ill-treatment.  
Very recently, a group of left-wing detainees 
has been savagely tortured in the Citadel 
prison.   
 
Mr. el-Hilaly, who is a Marxist and has been arrest ed six times since January 1959,  
made these remarks in a speech in the United States  over ten years ago.  Middle 
East Watch has gathered information about individua l cases of incommunicado 
detention and torture that occurred between 1989 an d early 1992.  Our own 
investigation leads us to conclude that torture has  continued in Egypt since Mr. el-
Hilaly spoke these words.

 In compiling this report, Middle East Watch has dr awn on the personal 
testimony of Egyptians from all walks of life, resi dents of cities, towns and villages 
throughout the country ranging in age from seventee n to sixty-five years old.  Their 
testimony forms the basis of the description and an alysis of the methods used by 
SSI to effect political arrests, the conditions and  treatment of detainees in SSI

custody, and the use of physical and psychological torture during interrogation 
sessions conducted by SSI officers.  Middle East Wa tch collected many more 
accounts of torture in SSI custody than those prese nted in this report; only the 
most detailed, internally consistent and persuasive  accounts have been included. 
  
 
 The report also examines the most notable flaws in  government 
investigations of torture complaints, based on info rmation provided by torture 
victims themselves and the experiences and insights  of Egyptian lawyers who 
have complained to the authorities on behalf of the ir clients.  
 
 Next, the report focuses on another gross human-ri ghts abuse: the long-

!  The consistency of the numerous accounts of tortu re taken by Middle East 
Watch from residents of cities and towns throughout  Egypt, about abuses that took 
place from 1989 to early 1992, reveals a pattern of  abuse, not isolated cases of 
aberrant behavior.  The similarity of these account s indicate that the process of 
arrest and detention, and the purposes and methods of torture by State Security 
Investigation forces remain unchanged from the tenu re of Interior Minister Gen. 
Zaki Badr to that of the current Interior Minister,  Gen. Muhammed Abdel Halim 
Moussa.1 
 
!  It is behind the closed doors of State Security I nvestigation offices or in off-
limits Central Security Forces military camps that harsh treatment, including 
torture, is applied against detainees in attempts t o extract information or 
confessions during interrogation, or to deter what is perceived by the state as 
undesirable political activity.  These practices vi olate Egyptian law as well as two 
human rights treaties to which Egypt is a state par ty: the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention A gainst Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  
 
!  State Security Investigation is the lead departme nt within the Ministry of 
Interior responsible for internal security matters in Egypt, under the direct control 
of the Minister of Interior.  The size of SSI, whic h is organized along a military chain 
of command, has never been publicly revealed by the  government.  The detailed 
testimony of torture victims persuades Middle East Watch that the methods of 
torture in Egypt are rigorous yet predictable, indi cating that a system appears to 
be in place to train SSI personnel in torture techn iques and that the use of torture 
is directed and supervised by officers in the SSI.    
 
!  The persistent reports about the use of torture b y SSI are a sensitive subject for 
                                                                    
     1MEW found this continuing pattern despite comments from senior Ministry of Interior 
officials to MEW in May 1990 that Interior Minister  Moussa in his first four-and-a-half 
months in office had completely forbidden torture, issued instructions "to treat people 
better than before," and emphasized the importance of following "correct procedures."  
(MEW interview with Dr. Bahaa el-Din Ibrahim, First  Assistant Minister of Interior for Public 
Relations, and Gen. Dr. Sami el-Husseini, Assistant  to the Minister of Interior for Inspection 
and Supervision, Cairo, May 30, 1990.)

the Egyptian government. In January 1992, the Egypt ian Cabinet discussed the 
subject of torture but, unfortunately, the thrust w as on public relations.  The 
Cabinet charged a special committee, composed of th e Ministers of Interior, 
Justice, Information and Foreign Affairs, to study ways to respond to allegations.  It 
was not charged with eradicating torture.  In omino us statements designed to 
have a chilling effect on human rights monitoring i n Egypt, government officials 
have argued that allegations of torture are made fo r the purpose of "striking a 
blow against stability and distorting the system of  government" and "distorting 
Egypt's reputation among international organization s."  In remarks to members of 
the Egyptian media on May 31, 1992, President Mubar ak said that he "is more 
concerned about human rights than anyone in Egypt.. .[adding] that although we 
respect human rights, it is unacceptable for human rights to be used as a pretext 
for interference in domestic affairs." 
 
!  The Interior Minister continues to deny unequivoc ally that torture takes place, 
despite court decisions, forensic medical reports b y Ministry of Justice 
physicians, numerous written complaints submitted b y lawyers to state 
prosecutors, frequent reports by the Egyptian Organ ization for Human Rights and 
Amnesty International, and abundant testimony from torture victims themselves. 
 
!  One theme that has marked the official denials of  torture is the characterization 
of victims in a manner designed to discredit them.  "We are dealing with fanatics 
who use violence," one Interior Ministry official t old MEW in 1990. "Complaints 
about torture at SSI offices normally are presented  by persons who are members 
of extremist groups," Prosecutor General el-Araby s tated to MEW in 1992.  
 
 It is undeniable that Egypt has faced internal vio lence attributed to 
clandestine Islamist groups and factions over the l ast decade, and that this 
violence -- coupled with often-violent responses by  security forces -- continues 
until today. But the fact that torture victims may be suspected radical or violent 
Islamists does not justify the practice of torture,  which is proscribed by the 
Egyptian Constitution, Egyptian law and internation al law. Indeed, torture victims' 
alleged actions and political affiliations are irre levant to this serious human 
rights abuse.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Egypt 
has ratified, proscribes torture absolutely, even i n the event of a public 
emergency that threatens the life of the nation.2

 In addition, while it is true that currently in Eg ypt most torture victims are 
believed to be members or supporters of radical Isl amic organizations or factions 
that the government has implicated in violence, thi s is not a complete picture of 
who is tortured in Egypt.  First, security force dr agnets sometimes are cast so wide 
that arbitrary arrests occur and detainees may be t ortured for information they 
simply do not possess.  Second, politically charged  statements by Egyptian 
government officials about "Islamic fanatics" ignor e the personal profiles of 
some of the Egyptians who have been tortured in the  last three years.   
 
 Among the Egyptians who have suffered torturers' b lindfolds, beatings, 
hangings, electric shocks and other abuses are lawy ers who defend politically 
unpopular clients, journalists affiliated with Isla mist opposition publications, 
Muslim Brotherhood members who express opinions at odds with the 
government, Christians suspected by the authorities  of converting Muslims to 
Christianity, and individual citizens targeted by s ecurity force operatives solely 
because they are thought to possess valued informat ion, such as the address of a 
security suspect.

 Typically it is SSI officers -- accompanied by SSI  soldiers and 
paramilitary Central Security Forces troops -- who carry out political arrests and 
take individuals into custody. Many suspects are ta ken into custody during post-
midnight raids on their private homes. The process of arrest is marked by 
intimidating tactics, a harrowing experience for th e detainee-to-be and his family.  
 
 Arresting agents often conduct thorough and someti mes violent 
searches of the premises and seize personal possess ions, particularly printed 
materials.  Officers in charge of these raids typic ally do not give their names or 
                                                                                                                                                                          
states: "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, w hether a state of war or a threat of

show identification. Most individuals taken into cu stody are given no information 
about the legal basis for their arrest, as required  by the Egyptian Constitution, nor 
are they told where they are being taken, leaving f amily members at a loss.  In 
some cases, family members of suspects sought by th e authorities have been 
arrested and detained until their sons, brothers or  husbands turned themselves in 
or were apprehended.   
 
 
    I I IINCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO DD DDETENTIONETENTIONETENTIONETENTION     
 
 Contrary to statements made to Middle East Watch b y Egypt's Prosecutor 
General and senior Interior Ministry officials, it is clear that incommunicado 
detention by SSI in the days immediately following arrest is a long-standing 
practice. In interviews with former detainees -- as  well as those currently held in 
prisons -- MEW found overwhelming evidence that ind ividuals are held in SSI 
custody after arrest and prior to their transfer to  prisons.   
 
 After arrest, it is common for political and secur ity suspects to remain in 
SSI custody for days, a week or longer.  Most are h eld incommunicado at SSI 
offices in Cairo and other cities; some are taken t o Central Security Forces 
military camps.  Many are blindfolded and handcuffe d before arriving at these 
facilities, and remain blindfolded throughout this entire period of detention.  The 
physical conditions of detention typically are crud e: small rooms, often dark, with 
poor ventilation and no toilets, mattresses or blan kets.  Detainees who have been 
held with their hands cuffed behind their backs rep ort that it was difficult or 
impossible to sleep. 
 
 MEW also found that some suspects, mostly teenager s, are held for brief 
periods by SSI and then released without ever enter ing a police station, a 
prosecutor's office or a prison.  They are arrested , held incommunicado in SSI 
custody and tortured, and then released after hours  or at most several days. It is 
unclear in these cases whether there was a legal ba sis for the arrest and 
detention and whether the arrests were officially r ecorded. 
 
 The practice of torture and other types of physica l and psychological 
mistreatment is facilitated and protected by this s tate-sanctioned system of 
incommunicado detention, as Egyptian human rights m onitors and lawyers have 
regularly monitored and reported. Since 1990, the E gyptian Organization for 
Human Rights has submitted numerous written complai nts about specific cases 
directly to the Ministry of Interior and the Prosec utor General's office (see     S S SSUMMARY OF UMMARY OF UMMARY OF UMMARY OF CC CCONCLUSIONS ONCLUSIONS ONCLUSIONS ONCLUSIONS $$ $$    1313 1313    
 
Appendix D).   
 
 This period of incommunicado detention appears to be unacknowledged 
by the authorities. In several cases of incommunica do detention examined in 
depth by MEW, officials claimed that detainees had not been arrested and 
detained at a time when in fact they were in the cu stody of security forces.  
Because Egyptian authorities refuse to acknowledge this practice, detainees held 
in this fashion are temporarily "disappeared" perso ns. By eliminating a sense of 
accountability, this practice invites torture and r elated abuses.

 SSI interrogations are designed to obtain informat ion, to elicit 
confessions, to recruit informers, or simply to int imidate and threaten individuals 
because of their perceived political -- and sometim es religious -- beliefs, 
affiliations or activities.  In some cases, the int errogators' line of questioning is 
pointed and specific, but in other cases the questi ons are of a general nature.  
Although not every political suspect detained by SS I is tortured while held 
incommunicado and questioned, torture frequently is  an element in the SSI 
interrogation process.  
 
 Egyptian government officials have consistently de nied that detainees 
are tortured in custody.  Significantly, these offi cials even deny that SSI officers 
conduct days-long interrogations of political detai nees and security suspects 
while held incommunicado in SSI custody.  Despite t hese claims, the testimony 
collected by MEW indicates that SSI officers clearl y have access to detainees for 
extended periods, and use this access for a variety  of purposes, ranging from 
general questioning about political beliefs, acquai ntances and affiliations to full-
fledged torture sessions aimed at securing informat ion or confessions.   
 
 The detail and consistency of the testimony leaves  little doubt that 
Egyptian security authorities detain individuals in communicado at specific 
locations throughout the country and, in numerous c ases, have tortured detainees 
with impunity. The cumulative weight and detail of scores of cases, over a period 
of years, is suggestive not merely of a practice, b ut of a government-sanctioned 
policy.

 Torture typically occurs after victims have been s tripped to their 
underwear.  In some cases, detainees are forced to confront their interrogators 
totally naked. They may be forced to stand long per iods prior to interrogation, or 
held in cells that lack mattresses and blankets, ma king it difficult or impossible to 
sleep.  They also may be deprived of regular suppli es of food and water.  
 
 The almost-universal prelude to torture in Egypt i s blindfolding of the 
eyes and cuffing of the hands, usually behind the b ack.  Egyptian Interior Minister 
Moussa told MEW that blindfolding is not allowed un der the rules governing the 
conduct of interrogations. "They don't tie the eyes ," he said.  "If blindfolding is 
used, of course an officer would be disciplined."3  Despite the Minister's assertion, 
MEW found that in virtually every case of SSI incom municado detention involving 
torture, detainees have been constantly blindfolded . This practice, of course, also 
prevents the victims from seeing and later identify ing their torturers. Continuous 
blindfolding for long periods causes physical pain and, in some cases, injury. 
 
 After the victim is blindfolded and handcuffed, ME W found that any of the 
following methods of physical and psychological abu se may occur, in a variety of 
combinations and sequences:  
 
 !  beating and kicking, including beating with stick s or other hard 
objects, by one or more individuals. 
 
 !  enforced standing for long periods. 
 
 !  suspension from bound wrists for long periods, ei ther with the feet 
touching the ground and supporting the body's weigh t or -- more painful -- with the 
feet off the ground and the body's weight supported  from the wrists. 
 
 !  binding the hands and feet around a pole placed a bove the forearms 
and behind the knees, with the pole supported betwe en two chairs while the soles 
and tops of the feet are beaten with a blunt object . 
 
 !  electric-shocking either while standing or while held to the floor with

a chair (the pain of electric shocks may be exacerb ated by dousing the victim with 
water prior to the administration of the shocks). 
 
 !  psychological torture, designed to produce a stat e of fear and 
uncertainty.  Techniques include interrogators' emp hasis that detainees' 
whereabouts in custody are not known; degrading ins ults and curses, and the use 
of language offensive to religious Muslims; threats  to inflict torture or sexual 
abuse on detainees or female family members, includ ing wives; threats to arrest 
family members; exposure to screams which some deta inees believed were tape-
recorded; and the general anxiety produced by waiti ng long periods -- while 
experiencing sensory deprivation -- for the next in terrogation and torture session 
to commence.  The vulnerability generated by variou s methods of psychological 
torture is only heightened by detainees' constant b lindfolding and, often, the 
removal of their clothing.  
 
 MEW also collected information about detainees who  were sexually 
abused by their interrogators.  This issue also was  the subject of a report issued 
by EOHR in January 1992.4

 MEW found little interest on the part of Egyptian government officials to 
do more than deny the existence of torture, cite th e laws that prohibit the practice, 
and describe how the investigation process should w ork.  Written complaints 
about specific cases of torture submitted by the Eg yptian Organization for Human 
Rights since 1990 simply have not been acknowledged  by the Prosecutor 
General's office or local prosecutors.  The Prosecu tor General went as far as to 
deny having received the repeated complaints about torture filed by EOHR.   
 
 In torture cases examined by MEW, Ministry of Just ice prosecutors 
demonstrated little interest in working actively wi th torture victims or their 
lawyers, let alone acting on complaints in a timely  manner or pursuing

to the Prosecutor General and to the Minister of In terior regarding all five cases.     16 16 1616    $$ $$    SS SSUMMARY OF UMMARY OF UMMARY OF UMMARY OF CC CCONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONS     
 
investigations thoroughly.  Middle East Watch colle cted information from lawyers 
and torture victims about the failure of the author ities to act in a timely manner on 
complaints about abuse during incommunicado detenti on, and to present victims 
for forensic medical examinations by Ministry of Ju stice physicians. Delaying 
victims' referral for examination is a critical lap se because in many cases of 
torture, timely examination is essential before mar ks, scars or other signs of 
physical abuse lessen or disappear.  
 
 If prosecutors do not have contact with a torture victim following his 
period of incommunicado detention, lawyers themselv es initiate complaints. After 
seeing a client who has been tortured, usually when  the client has been moved to 
a prison, a lawyer may initiate a request for a med ical examination by submitting 
a complaint to the niyaba. But attorneys told MEW t hat in many cases the 
complaint is simply ignored or the victim is not su mmoned to give testimony to 
the niyaba in a timely fashion, which in turn delay s the medical examination.

 In addition to the problem of incommunicado detent ion by SSI prior to 
transfer to a prison, a parallel problem reportedly  exists with regard to movement 
of detainees from prisons into temporary SSI custod y without documenting such 
movements in prison log-books. The practice of omit ting information from prison 
log-books that would document the access of SSI off icers to prisoners is not new. 
A former high-ranking Ministry of Interior inspecto r, Gen. Samir Abed al-Rahman 
`Eid, who is also a lawyer, complained publicly abo ut the practice in the 1980s. 
 
 The movement of detainees out of prisons appears t o be done for two 
reasons: for interrogation by SSI -- sometimes acco mpanied by torture -- in 
incommunicado detention, and to facilitate continuo us long-term detention of 
political prisoners ordered released from detention  by a court.   The latter purpose 
allows the authorities to claim that detainees have  been released pursuant to 
court orders when in fact they simply are removed f rom prison and held in SSI 
custody until a new detention order can be written.

power under the emergency law to subvert the rule o f law in cases of political 
prisoners held under administrative detention.  Isl amist and Palestinian 
detainees -- some of whom have been held without ch arge since 1990 -- claim that 
they have been continuously detained under successi ve detention orders despite 
court-ordered releases.   
 Detainees who are held long-term despite judicial orders for their 
release are concentrated in two prisons: the Islami sts in Tora Istikbal, and the 
Palestinians in Abu Za`bal Liman.  Detainees in bot h prisons provided MEW with 
information that after court-ordered releases they are removed from prison, held 
incommunicado in SSI custody, and returned to the p rison after new detention 
orders have been issued. Since they never see freed om after they are ordered 
released, it is unlikely that the new detention ord ers are based on reasons that 
have not already been rejected by the Higher State Security Court.  
 
 While Egypt's emergency law affords the Minister o f Interior the right to 
object to a detainee's challenge of his detention o rder before the Higher State 
Security Court, the detainee should be released onc e the detention order is 
overruled by two courts. Judicial review is designe d to curb the arbitrary or 
punitive exercise of the powers of arrest and deten tion. The flouting of judicial 
rulings through the technique of repeatedly issuing  new administrative detention 
orders against targeted individuals is a violation of the fundamental human right 
not to be arbitrarily deprived of one's freedom.

 Egypt has earned a secure place in U.S. foreign ai d programs as a key 
regional ally of the United States.  It receives ov er $2.26 billion in direct annual 
military and economic assistance, making the countr y one of the top four 
recipients of U.S. foreign aid -- second to Israel but ahead of Turkey and Greece.  In 
addition, in December 1990 the U.S. cancelled $6.7 billion of Egypt's military debt.  
The substantial leverage afforded by this significa nt level of aid has never been 
utilized -- by the Bush Administration or by the U. S. Congress -- to effect specific 
improvements in Egypt's human rights practices or t o push for lifting the almost-
permanent state of emergency.   
 
 Although the U.S. State Department in 1992 provide d a frank and 
generally accurate assessment of human rights viola tions in Egypt, Middle East 
Watch is not aware of one instance in 1990, 1991 or  thus far in 1992 when any 
Administration spokesperson publicly made reference  to human rights abuses in     18 18 1818    $$ $$    SS SSUMMARY OF UMMARY OF UMMARY OF UMMARY OF CC CCONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONSONCLUSIONS     
 
Egypt or to the need for the Mubarak government to address human rights 
problems.  
 
 The Bush Administration has requested some $1.3 bi llion in foreign 
military financing assistance for Egypt for Fiscal Year 1993.  Section 502B of the 
U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, pr ohibits security assistance to 
any "country the government of which engages in a c onsistent pattern of gross 
violations of internationally recognized human righ ts."  Gross violations are 
defined in the statute to include "torture or cruel , inhuman, or degrading 
treatment or punishment" and "prolonged detention w ithout charges and trial."  
As this report concludes, Egypt has engaged in a pa ttern of both torture and 
prolonged arbitrary detention. Although Section 502 B allows the Administration, if 
it deems it necessary to provide aid to an abusive country, to explain to Congress 
"the extraordinary circumstances warranting provisi on of such assistance," 
neither the Bush Administration nor any previous Ad ministration has submitted 
such a statement to Congress.  Even short of a redu ction in aid, such a statement 
would dramatically raise the profile of human right s abuse in Egypt, and generate 
pressure for its curtailment. 
 
 The U.S. Congress has been equally derelict in app lying Section 502B 
requirements to Egypt.  Members have not debated th e issue of conditioning aid to 
specific human rights improvements, or demanded exp lanations from the 
Administration why extraordinary circumstances warr ant continuing aid.  While 
Congress has vigorously questioned the Administrati on about the recent U.S. 
rapprochement with Syria, questions about Egypt hav e been rare.   
 
 Although the U.S. is the largest bilateral donor t o Egypt, France, Germany, 
Italy and the United Kingdom also provide sizeable amounts of aid, as does the 
twelve-nation European Community and international financial institutions such 
as the World Bank.  None of these donors has condit ioned their substantial 
assistance to Egypt on human-rights improvements.       RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATIONSRECOMMENDATIONSRECOMMENDATIONS

 Middle East Watch calls on the Egyptian government  to adhere to and 
enforce the provisions of the United Nations Conven tion Against Torture and Other 
Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or P unishment (Torture 
Convention).  Egypt acceded to the Torture Conventi on on June 25, 1986.  Under 
Article 2, Egypt is obliged to take "effective legi slative, administrative, judicial or 
other measures to prevent acts of torture."  To ful fill that obligation, President 
Hosni Mubarak and his government should: 
   
 ! Publicly acknowledge that torture is practiced sys tematically by 
Egyptian security forces and order its immediate ce ssation.  
 
 !  Issue a general order to all police officers to d isobey torture orders 
and to report such orders to investigative authorit ies, and ensure that this 
information will not be used in any way against tho se officers who make reports. 
 
 ! Appoint a special public prosecutor to investigate  torture and 
mistreatment by officers and soldiers of State Secu rity Investigation or any other 
security forces. This prosecutor should be empowere d to bring criminal charges 
against SSI and other Ministry of Interior officers  who have violated Egyptian law.  
The prosecutor should receive the firm public backi ng of President Mubarak, and 
have a length of tenure sufficient to ensure indepe ndence. 
 
 ! Appoint an independent commission -- composed of i ndependent 
lawyers and legal scholars -- to investigate the pr actice of incommunicado 
detention at State Security Investigation offices a nd Central Security Forces 
military camps.  All SSI officers should be made av ailable, as requested by the 
commission, to provide testimony, and commission me mbers should be given 
unlimited access to SSI offices and CSF camps durin g the course of their inquiry. 
 
 !  Order the Ministry of Interior immediately to cea se the practice of 
incommunicado detention and establish provisions fo r access of attorneys and 
family members to detainees promptly after arrest.  Logs open to public 
inspection should be maintained, recording all pris oner transfers and the officers 
who take custody of the prisoners at each transfer point.  Failure to record 
required information accurately and completely shou ld lead to vigorous 
investigation and firm disciplinary or criminal pun ishment of all offenders.        22 22 2222    $$ $$    RR RRECOMMENDATIONSECOMMENDATIONSECOMMENDATIONSECOMMENDATIONS

 Arrests of political and security suspects in Egyp t typically are carried 
out by State Security Investigation officers and so ldiers, who often are 
accompanied by paramilitary Central Security Forces  troops.  Many suspects are 
taken into custody during post-midnight raids on th eir private homes.  Arresting 
agents often conduct thorough and sometimes violent  searches of the premises 
and seize personal possessions, particularly printe d materials.   
 
 Officers in charge of these raids typically do not  give their names or 
show identification. Most individuals taken into cu stody are given no information 
about the legal basis for their arrest, nor are the y told where they are being taken, 
leaving family members at a loss.   
 
 In some cases, family members of suspects sought b y the authorities 
have been arrested and detained until their sons, b rothers or husbands turned 
themselves in or were apprehended.

 State Security Investigation ( mabahith `amn al-dawla  in Arabic), the lead 
agency within the Ministry of Interior responsible for internal security matters in 
Egypt, figures prominently in this report.1  When political arrests are made, 
                                                                    
     1The U.S. State Department's human rights report on Egypt for 1991 described SSI this way:

typically it is SSI officers -- accompanied by SSI soldiers and paramilitary Central 
Security Forces troops -- who carry out the arrest and take individuals into 
custody.  The number of SSI personnel has never bee n publicly revealed by the 
government.2   
 
 The headquarters of SSI are located off Lazoughly Square in the Abdeen 
district of Cairo, on the same block that houses th e buildings of the Ministry of 
Interior and the Ministry of Justice. SSI has a sec ond office in metropolitan Cairo, 
in the Dokki district of Giza, and offices in other  cities throughout the country.  
 
 SSI is under the direct control of the Interior Mi nister.3  It is organized 
along a military chain of command and is headed by a general.  The post is 
currently held by Gen. Mustafa Abdul Kader, who has  the title of First Assistant 
Secretary to the Minister of Interior and is widely  regarded as the Minister of 
Interior's "right hand."4  MEW's request to the Egyptian government in Decem ber 
1991 for a meeting with Gen. Kader during its 1992 mission to Egypt was not 
granted, although other Ministry of Interior offici als were made available for 
meetings with MEW representatives in February 1992.   In April 1992, MEW wrote 
again to the Egyptian authorities and requested a m eeting with Gen. Kader to 
discuss the findings in this report.  As of the dat e of the publication of this report, 
has not yet received a positive response from the E gyptian government. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                          
the main domestic security agency, although there a re several other police forces.  It 
enforces the state of emergency and conducts most i nvestigations of domestic opponents 
of the Government.  It has been implicated in many reports of torture and abuse of prisoners 
and detainees."  ( Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1991 , February 1992, p. 
1374.)  SSI is one of three intelligence agencies i n Egypt; the others are Military Intelligence 
within the Ministry of Defense, and General Intelli gence, "attached to the presidency."

     4Gen. Kader formerly served as an assistant to the M inister's previous First Assistant 
Secretary, Gen. Mustafa Kamel, who in March 1991 wa s appointed governor of Dakhaliyya 
province in the Delta.     P P PPROCESS OF ROCESS OF ROCESS OF ROCESS OF AA AARREST RREST RREST RREST $$ $$    29292929    
 
 Other police forces and the paramilitary Central S ecurity Forces report to 
the general security directorate ( mudiriyyat al-`amn ) in each province.  The head 
of each security directorate is known as the mudir al-`amn ; this officer serves 
under the provincial governor, who is appointed by the president.  Egyptians with 
knowledge of SSI's operations say that, uniquely, S tate Security Investigation 
bypasses this organizational structure and is not s ubordinate to governors' 
authority;  SSI provincial units are said to report  directly to SSI headquarters in 
Cairo.  
 
 As noted, SSI officers and soldiers when they make  arrests usually are 
accompanied by soldiers from the Central Security F orces (` amn marqazi ), part of 
the Interior Ministry.  The U.S. State Department, in its 1991 human rights report on 
Egypt, described the Central Security Forces as the  military force which "protects 
public buildings, facilities and foreign missions,"  but this large paramilitary unit 
plays a broader role.  "It is the army of the polic e, the army of the Ministry of 
Interior," one Egyptian observer told MEW.5  CSF soldiers are at the disposal of 
Egypt's various police forces, including SSI.  A fo rmer general in the Interior 
Ministry told MEW: "The President is totally depend ent on them to stabilize his 
position.  This is the force the SSI requisitions a nd supervises.  For example, the 
SSI will notify the Ministry of Interior that it ne eds 15,000 ` amn marqazi  soldiers.  If 
a demonstration at a university needs to be crushed , the SSI will use ` amn 
marqazi ," he said.6  Another former Interior Ministry general told MEW  that CSF 
troops "are well-trained to punish people."7 
 
 The Central Security Forces (CSF) were organized a s a civil defense force 
after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, due to the negativ e public reaction to President 
Abd el-Nasser's use of army troops to put down spon taneous student 
demonstrations at Alexandria University in November  1967, five months after 
Egypt's devastating military defeat.  "Nasser had n ever confronted hostile masses 
before,"  a former student leader remembered.8  The next year, in February, student

demonstrations erupted in Mahalla in the Nile Delta  and at Cairo University.  The 
army was not brought in but the regular police forc e clearly was unequipped to 
handle such a situation.  
 
 This was the context that led to the formation of CSF.  Its ranks steadily 
expanded during Sadat's decade-long tenure as presi dent. He first used CSF 
troops in January 1972 to put down student protests  at Cairo University and Ain 
Shams University through a dawn military-style sieg e of both campuses, which 
was followed by mass arrests.   
 
 CSF conscripts, many of whom are illiterate and ha ve been rejected for 
army service, serve their three years of compulsory  military service in this force 
instead of the army: 
 
  The government had hoped that the CSF 
would counterbalance the military's power, 
but the force never served this function.  
Poorly educated conscripts from rural areas 
who failed to meet the standards of army 
service filled the ranks of the CSF.  Officers 
often treated the conscripts harshly and 
frequently humiliated them.  Conscripts 
commonly lived in tents and sometimes 
lacked beds, adequate plumbing, and 
electricity.9 
 
 The poor treatment and conditions of service of th ese conscripts led to a 
violent eruption in February 1986 as thousands of t roops in Cairo rioted over a 
three-day period and fought the army.10  The crisis led to the dismissal of then-
                                                                    
     9Egypt: A Country Study , p. 340. 
     10The events were sparked by a rumor that conscripts'  required service would be 
extended from three years to four years. As describ ed in a leading reference book on the 
Middle East, some 17,000 CSF troops "went on the ra mpage in and around Cairo, destroying 
two luxury hotels and damaging other buildings used  by tourists in the Pyramids area of the 
city.  The disturbances lasted for three days and t here were clashes between the 
conscripts and the army, which was trying to regain  control of the city.  According to 
government figures, 107 people died as a result of the mutiny, and 1,324 members of the CSF     P P PPROCESS OF ROCESS OF ROCESS OF ROCESS OF AA AARREST RREST RREST RREST $$ $$    3131 3131    
 
Interior Minister Ahmad Roushdie, but "the governme nt continued to use the CSF 
as the main force for dealing with student disturba nces, intimidating industrial 
strikers and peasant demonstrators, and curbing gat herings of Islamic 
activists."11 
 
 When Hosni Mubarak assumed the presidency, the CSF  numbered 
100,000 troops.12  In the next ten years, the force tripled in size.   The current size of 
CSF, which has barracks in every province, was esti mated at 300,000 as of June 
1990, just slightly smaller than the 320,000-strong  Egyptian army.13  MEW has 
gathered information about SSI's use of Central Sec urity Forces military camps 
(muaskarat ) in the provinces for incommunicado detention and torture.

 SSI has organized and carries out a formidable sys tem of nationwide 
surveillance, using both its own plainclothes agent s -- widely described in Egypt 
as mukhbireen14 -- and a network of informers, some of whom appear  to be 
recruited while they are held in SSI detention.  Th e U.S. State Department affirmed 
in 1991 that security-force surveillance extends to  interference with the right to

means -- such as the screening of mail -- used to c ollect information.15 
 
 Interior Minister Gen. Muhammed Abdel Halim Moussa  acknowledged in 
an interview with MEW that Egyptian internal-securi ty forces undertake 
systematic surveillance nationwide.  He indicated t hat the information collected 
through this system serves as the basis for targeti ng individuals for arrest and 
detention.16  
 
 The Interior Minister pointed out that each of Egy pt's twenty-six 
governorates has a security directorate and within each directorate is a detention 
affairs committee which conducts area-wide surveill ance, presumably of 
suspected or known members of targeted organization s and clandestine groups.  
Information from  detention affairs committees is t ransmitted to the provincial 
security directorate, which is composed of represen tatives of all the police and 
security branches that oversee criminal and interna l security matters.  The 
minister explained that these committees make recom mendations for detention 
to a central office in the Ministry of Interior, wh ich in turn makes 
recommendations directly to the Minister of Interio r, who signs individual 
detention orders under state of emergency legislati on.    
 
 Higazi Ibrahim Abdul Meguid, a Muslim cleric ( imam ) from Aga, a town 
southwest of Mansoura in Daqaliyya governorate, tol d MEW about SSI surveillance 
                                                                    
     15"The internal security services have the capability  to monitor telephone and other 
private conversations of the political opposition a nd a broad range of citizens suspected of 
illegal or subversive activity.  There are persiste nt and credible reports of routine 
screening of, and in some cases interference with, correspondence, especially 
international mail.  As with search warrants, telep hone taps and mail screening normally 
require the prior authorization of the Public Prose cutor, but normal procedures do not 
prevail when the Emergency Law is invoked.  The [Ge neral Directorate for State Security 
Investigations] and the other domestic intelligence  agencies engage routinely in 
surveillance of opposition politicians, political o r social activists, foreign diplomats, and 
suspected subversives. Employees of most government  facilities, public sector factories, 
and foreign embassies assume that their activities are monitored by government 
informants." (U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1990 ,

of his activities.  He was arrested by the security  forces and held without charge 
from October 26 until November 23, 1991.  "Before m y arrest and until now, I am 
under surveillance.  I go to sleep fearing arrest. I cannot sleep peacefully ... they 
can come at any moment," he explained. 
 
 Egyptians under surveillance by security forces, e specially in smaller 
cities and towns, told MEW that it was not difficul t to spot the soldiers assigned to 
this task. The imam, for example, said: "I know the  mukhbireen  ... there are three 
main mukhbireen  in my district.  I see them in my mosque and in fr ont of my house. 
 They monitor lectures and prayers in the mosque. T hey're there all the time, 
twenty-four hours a day, openly, like my shadow.  T here is one in front of the 
mosque, one is present when I stand with the people , there is even one when I'm 
sitting in the mosque alone.  Any imam is always un der continuous surveillance if 
he speaks out."17 
 
 The Alexandria home of a family that pursued the c ase of the 
disappearance of their son was under surveillance b y mukhbireen  for one year.  
The mother of Amgad Shinawi, a sixteen-year-old who  had been arrested and 
tortured in the SSI building in Alexandria in Novem ber 1988, told MEW that her son 
never came home from school on December 14, 1988, a nd has not been seen 
since.18  After complaining about Amgad's disappearance, th e family was 
harassed and summoned by security forces.  "For one  year they had our house 
under surveillance,"  Mrs. Shinawi said.  "We just stayed home.  Every time we filed 
a complaint, we were summoned by SSI." (See Chapter  Three for additional 
information about this case.)

effecting an arrest. This method of arrest has been  used for over a decade, as the 
personal account of a prominent Egyptian journalist  reveals. 
 
 Muhammed Heikal, who was detained along with hundr eds of other 
prominent Egyptians on September 3, 1981, wrote abo ut his arrest at 2:15 a.m., 
when two officers from SSI knocked on his door of h is Alexandria apartment.  
"Looking at my watch, and seeing what the time was,  I reminded them that it was I 
who had coined the phrase `the visitors of the dawn ' to describe such intrusions, 
and that I had often in print condemned these as ty rannical.  They said they were 
sorry, but they were simply obeying orders."  When Heikal left his apartment in the 
custody of the officers, "I was horrified by what I  saw. On the small landing...were 
at least ten soldiers, all armed with automatic rif les.  The glass in the door leading 
to the service stairs had been broken and soldiers were stationed there too.  Every 
floor in the block of flats was occupied by troops. ...When we reached the ground Munira Ismail, the wife of Dr. Haron Talha, told ME W 
that just before 1:00 a.m. on the night of December  20, 
1991, there were violent knocks at the door of thei r 
house in the town of Gamaliyya. "The door has two 
locks and one of them broke.  My husband opened the  
door and there were about twenty-five men in civili an 
clothes.  They shouted at my husband and asked his 
name.  One of the men pushed him.  They searched 
the room and looked at our library of Islamic books .  
They opened a drawer in the bedroom and removed 
his diabetes medicine.  They pulled up the mattress , 
and found nothing.  One of them went to the four 
children and said: `Wake up.  We'll take you with y our 
father.' 
 
 "They told my husband he'd be coming with 
them.  I tried to prepare some clothes but one of t he 
officers said no.  I begged them to allow him at le ast 
his shoes -- it took a debate for this."       P P PPROCESS OF ROCESS OF ROCESS OF ROCESS OF AA AARREST RREST RREST RREST $$ $$    35353535    
 
floor I found that the entrance was filled with tro ops.  Our apartment building is in 
a narrow street leading to the sea and both ends of  this had been blocked by 
trucks loaded with security police. `It looks like a scene from Z,' I said to the 
officer, but he did not understand the reference."19 
 
 Suspects' homes are thoroughly and, occasionally, violently searched.  
Books and other printed matter usually are seized d uring the search; other 
personal possessions -- such as photo albums -- als o may be taken.  
 
 Dr. Abd el-Gawaad Sheishai, a professor of social pediatrics at Mansoura 
University, told MEW of his arrest in the early mor ning hours of August 5, 1989.  
"There was knocking on my door at three in the morn ing.  I opened the door and 
found a large number of men in civilian clothes out side the door and on the stairs. 
 There were more of them on the street. They entere d and searched the entire 
house, giving no explanation or reason."  He was th en taken to the SSI building in 
Mansoura, to another SSI office and, eventually, to  a prison, where he was held for 
four months.20  
 
 Engineer Kamal Khalil was arrested on August 24, 1 989, after a heavily 
armed security force entered his home at 3:00 a.m.  Pointing machine guns at his 
wife and two daughters, six and ten years old, they  ransacked the house for 
approximately ninety minutes, and seized books and photographs of Khalil with 
family members and friends.21 
 
 Higazi Ibrahim Abdul Meguid, the Muslim cleric, to ld MEW of his arrest at 
his home on Friday night, October 25, 1991.  "I was  surprised by knocks on the door 
at about one in the morning. I opened the door and there were about ten to fifteen 
Central Security Forces soldiers, SSI officers and mukhbireen .  They entered, 
searched my house and took papers, books and magazi nes.  Then I was told to 
come with them.  There were more soldiers downstair s and others outside the 
house."   He was taken to the SSI building in Mit G hamr, where he was held that

 Former Member of Parliament Hassan al-Gamal, who s erved three 
consecutive terms from 1979 to 1989, was arrested i n October 1991.  He told MEW 
that he was apprehended on the street by a force of  about a dozen SSI officers and 
many soldiers after Saturday prayers. "They took me  to my house, showed an 
arrest warrant and told me to prepare things, that I would be going with them.  
They searched the house thoroughly, frightening and  disturbing my family.  They 
even searched my wife's bedroom and inside the chil dren's books." Among the 
items seized were press clippings of his career as a Parliament member and 
assorted postcards.23   
 
 There may be verbal threats directed at the detain ee or family members; 
provocative questions about politics, acquaintances  or activities occasionally are 
asked by SSI officers.  One Cairo University studen t was arrested at 3:00 a.m. on 
October 25, 1991 by plainclothes SSI officers who c ame to his family's house.  With 
guns pointed at his parents, they began to ask him questions about the Muslim 
Brotherhood, other Islamic groups and individuals h e knew.  "What you won't say 
here, you'll say there," one of the officers told h im.  "You'll even say what you don't 
know."  The student told MEW that during the search  of the house books on Islam, 
which are openly sold in Cairo bookshops, were seiz ed.  His father's library 
included professional books on government organizat ion and management.  
"They were so ignorant.  They took these books, too , thinking they were about 
political organizing," the student said.24 
 
 The information gathered by MEW shows that it is u ncommon for security 
officers to identify themselves or inform the detai nee or his family about why or 
where he is being taken.  Some former detainees tol d MEW that misinformation 
had been provided to their families -- about their place of detention, the name of 
the SSI officer in charge, or the expected duration  of their detention.

 The Egyptian Constitution guarantees that every pe rson who is arrested 
or detained must be "informed immediately" of the r easons.25  The right is further 
specified in the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states in part: "Every person 
under arrest or remanded into custody must be infor med immediately of the 
reasons for his arrest or detention."26 
 
 However, MEW found that these rights are not respe cted.  Arrest 
operations such as those described above are charac terized by a paucity of 
information, both written and oral.  This secrecy m erely serves to increase the 
intimidating effect.  Egyptian Interior Ministry of ficials told MEW in 1990 that 
detainees are always informed verbally of the reaso ns for their arrest, although 
they admitted that it is not a practice to put this  information in writing for 
presentation to the detainee at the moment of arres t, a procedure they termed 
"not important": 
 
  When we arrest someone, we always tell him 
why he was arrested or detained. The real 
complaint [the detainees make] is that it is 
not always put in writing. But this is a 
formality and not very important. Besides the 
court always tells him, in writing. We must 
tell him orally, and always do. Sometimes it is 
difficult to tell him in writing on the spot.27 
 
Despite these assurances, MEW found that in the maj ority of cases it is rare for the 
authorities at the time of arrest to provide writte n or verbal information that sheds 
light on the legal basis and reasons for a person's  detention or to inform the 
                                                                    
     25Article 71 of the Constitution reads as follows: "E very person who is arrested or detained 
must be informed immediately of the reasons for his  arrest or detention.  He has the right to 
communicate with any person whom he wishes to advis e of what has happened or from 
whom he may wish to seek assistance in the manner p rescribed by law."

Mattar's arrest in 1991 is an example: 
 
  At 2:30 after midnight on March 2, 1991, a 
force armed with machine guns, clubs and 
shields raided my house and bedroom .... 
Under the leadership of officers in military 
uniforms and civilian clothes, the force 
carried out a thorough search of my home, 
books and personal papers, without 
presenting a warrant from the niyaba or the 
judicial authorities, or specifying the 
purpose of this frightening armed attack.   
 
  Following the search, I was taken, my hands

shoot....The transfer vehicle...started off,

 If a suspect is not present when the security forc es come to arrest him, 
MEW found that family members may be subjected to h arassment and even arrest 
until the suspect turns himself in to the authoriti es. Amnesty International noted 
in a January 1992 report: "Dozens of relatives have  reportedly been abused and 
beaten up while in detention centres or even in the ir homes when visited by SSI 
officers.  Often they are subject to continuing har assment even after their 
release....[T]he imprisonment of parents, relatives  and associates as `substitute 
prisoners' amounts virtually to hostage-taking and is a gross violation of human 
rights."29  Middle East Watch concurs.

 In October 1991, two brothers of Hani Abd el-Magd Haneh Siam, a 
mathematics teacher wanted by the authorities, were  arrested and held until he 
turned himself in.  The teacher, from Mit Maymoun, a village with a population of 
about 4,000 near the city of Tanta, told MEW that i t was obvious he was wanted by 
security forces. "They came to my home on October 2 6, 1991," he told MEW.  "I 
wasn't there.  They searched the house, my brother' s house and the house of 
another relative.  They took a personal photo album , a library of books, and copies 
of the Koran and Koranic cassettes.   
 
 "They took two of my brothers as hostages and thre atened my fiancee. 
They stayed for four days at the entrances of the v illage, terrorizing people.  They 
started to summon my relatives, even relatives outs ide the village, and ordinary 
people not related to me.  An SSI officer went to m y school and crossed my name 
off the register.  The headmaster of my school was summoned. He was asked to 
write a negative report about me, and was threatene d with transfer to Upper Egypt 
if he did not comply. I gave myself up to SSI in Zi fta."30  (He was tortured in SSI 
custody, then transferred to Abu Za`bal prison and released on November 16, 1991; 
see Chapter Three for his account.)  
 
 MEW obtained additional testimony about this pract ice, dating back to 
1990: 
 
    "It Was All Done to Threaten Us" "It Was All Done to Threaten Us""It Was All Done to Threaten Us""It Was All Done to Threaten Us" 
 The mother of seven children, Hosnea Abdul Kader M uhammed, fifty-
three years old, told MEW about her experience in M arch 1990, when she was 
detained and held as a hostage:   
 
  One night in March, at about one in the 
morning, security forces wearing black 
civilian clothes came to our house.  They took 
me by the neck and used a whip on me, a 
special whip that wraps around you -- he 
pulls on it and then it cuts your flesh.  A 
mukhbir , whom I know and can identify, stole

money from the buffet.  They took my husband 
and hit him with a gun butt. They conducted a 
thorough search of the house. 
 
 One of her sons was serving in the army and not at  home; another son, 
Sayyid, an electrical worker, was sleeping at his w orkplace. "One officer said that I 
knew nothing but they took me to Bandar police stat ion.  First, I was taken in a box-
like van around Minya and they picked up about fift een people. I was the only 
woman. I stayed in the police station for six days.   They asked me no questions.  I 
was a hostage.  They did this to me because they wa nted my son Hamdi, who was 
not yet sixteen years old.  My son Sayyid came to v isit me on the fourth day of my 
detention.  They took him to SSI and beat him and t hen detained him for six 
months.  After the sixth day, I told the police tha t Sayyid was at SSI and they 
released me.   
 
 "It was all done to threaten us," she concluded.  "They told me that my 
sons should not have contact with Islamic groups.  After this, they came to the 
house every three days.  During Ramadan in 1991, th ey raided the house while we 
were on a visit to Alexandria.  They broke and stol e things, and damaged the doors, 
the windows, furniture.  Then it was okay until two  weeks ago."31  She noted that in 
January 1992, plainclothes SSI soldiers began to st and in front of her house in 
Minya and ask questions about two of her sons.  Thi s made her fearful of a repeat 
of the March 1990 experience described above.

 Muhammed Raslan, another Minya resident, told MEW of the continual 
harassment of his family by the security forces in 1990, beginning with a 
nighttime raid and culminating in the arrest and de tention of family members, all 
because his sons were wanted by the authorities.    
 He said that one night in March 1990 he was asleep  with his family and 
was awakened by knocking on the door, followed by t he door being broken down.  
"There were police everywhere.  The street was full  of Central Security Forces 
soldiers, policemen, SSI, all armed with automatic weapons.  They asked for my 
sons Adil and Mustafa, who were not home.  They des troyed the furniture in the 
house.  An SSI officer, Ali Anwar, threatened that he would bring Adil and Mustafa 
dead.

 "They left and returned two days later at two in t he morning.  It was a 
large force again.  They pointed automatic weapons at our chests.  They searched 
the house and left."  After this, the security forc es arrested his son Mustafa.  "Then 
they came to the house again and asked for Adil.  I n May 1990, my son Nagy, who 
was in his last year of high school, was arrested a t his grandmother's house.  For 
four days we didn't know where he was.  The niyaba finally found Nagy, with marks 
of torture, in Bandar police station in the intelli gence section.  The niyaba, whose 
name is Ashraf, was a witness to this and he ordere d a forensic medical 
examination."  (Nagy was eventually taken to Tora I stikbal prison and held for 
eighteen months.  "They moved him from Tora to Band ar police station and back to 
Tora again, over this year-and-a-half period," his father said.) 
 
 Even after Nagy's arrest, SSI harassment of the fa mily continued.  "Once, 
on July 7, we went to Bandar police station to brin g food to Nagy and when we 
returned home all the furniture in the house was sm ashed.  We complained to the 
niyaba and he sent a soldier to see what had happen ed.  Adil's wife was a witness 
to this; it happened at nine in the morning and the y held a gun to her head.  In her 
complaint, she named Nabil Fahmy, Akram Hammoudi an d Oussama Kamal from 
the investigation police."  
 
 Later the same month, on July 16, Mustafa escaped from the police 
station.  "They arrested me, my wife, Adil's wife a nd two of Adil's small children," 
his father said.  "This happened right after the es cape.  We were held in Bandar 
police station.  My 
wife was released 
at four in the 
morning, after four 
hours.  I was held 
for four days -- they 
just closed me in a 
room.  I was 
released when Mustafa was arrested again in Alexand ria.  Then, two days later, 
they came and asked for my eight-year-old son Khali d, who was with me in Suez.  
When I returned from Suez, I found that my mother, my wife and two children had 
been arrested.  This happened on July 17 or July 18 .  I went to the niyaba to 
complain and he said: `Go home and you will find th em.'  I went to the house and 
they were there."  Muhammed Raslan told MEW that hi s son Adil later was arrested "I was held for four days -- they just closed me in  a 
room.  I was released when [my son] Mustafa was

 After arrest, it is common for political and secur ity suspects to remain in 
SSI custody for days, a week or longer.  Most are h eld incommunicado at SSI 
offices in Cairo or other cities; some are taken to  Central Security Forces military 
camps.  Many are blindfolded and handcuffed before arriving at these facilities, 
and remain blindfolded throughout this entire perio d of detention.  The physical 
conditions of detention typically are crude: small rooms, often dark, with poor 
ventilation and no toilets, mattresses or blankets.   Detainees who have been held 
with their hands cuffed behind their backs report t hat it was difficult or 
impossible to sleep. 
 
 Egyptian human rights monitors and lawyers have re gularly monitored 
and reported cases of incommunicado detention invol ving mistreatment or 
torture. Since 1990, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights has submitted 
numerous written complaints about specific cases di rectly to the Ministry of 
Interior and the Prosecutor General's office (see A ppendix D).  MEW has 
independently collected information about the pract ice of incommunicado 
detention.  
 
 Despite the accumulation of evidence, senior offic ials in the executive 
and judicial branches of the Egyptian government re fuse to acknowledge that SSI 
holds detainees incommunicado for long periods.  De tainees held in this fashion 
are temporarily "disappeared" persons, in that thei r detention is unacknowledged 
by the authorities.  By eliminating a sense of acco untability, this policy invites 
torture and related abuses.

the Ministry of Interior through its Prisons Admini stration.  Yet MEW found that the 
authorities do not always transfer political and se curity suspects to these 
facilities immediately following arrest.  Instead, suspects typically remain in the 
custody of SSI, held incommunicado for days and som etimes for over one week.   
 
 MEW took testimony from former and current detaine es who were 
arrested in Cairo, or in cities and towns in the pr ovinces, and the pattern was the 
same: incommunicado detention at an SSI office, or several different SSI offices, 
before transfer to a prison.  Some suspects are tak en to Central Security Forces 
military camps where they are held incommunicado.  MEW has received reports 
about SSI's use of CSF camps for detention in Fayou m and Assyut and in the camp 
at Hurghada, north of the city of Safaja on the Red  Sea.   
 
 In some -- but not all -- cases of incommunicado d etention, MEW found 
that detainees may first spend a brief period at a police station prior to being 
brought to an SSI office or a CSF military camp.  D etainees also may be held at a 
police station while they are in transit from one S SI facility to another.  At times, 
detainees in police stations are questioned while b lindfolded and handcuffed.  
 During MEW's visit to the general prison in the cit y of Tanta on February 
19, 1992, the prison commander said that prisoners arrive at Tanta from 
the courts via the police stations.  But this was n ot the case for 
veterinarian Hamdi Mahmoud Morsi el-Sayyidi, twenty -eight, whom MEW 
found that day in the prison's twelve-cell punishme nt wing.  
 
He told MEW that he had been arrested by security f orces who came to 
his home between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. on January 17, 1992.  "I was 
blindfolded the second I was put in the car."  He w as taken to the SSI 
building in Tanta.  For the first three days, he wa s questioned, while 
blindfolded, "on and off" by two individuals.  "The y wanted information 
about certain people," he told MEW.  He was not tor tured or physically 
abused by his interrogators.  His blindfold was rem oved only when he ate 
his meals.  After ten days, he was brought to Tanta  Prison and placed 
directly in the punishment cell where MEW found him .  After twenty days 
in the prison, he was seen by his lawyer and learne d that he had been 
detained by order of the Interior Minister.       I I IINCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO DD DDETENTION ETENTION ETENTION ETENTION $$ $$    4545 4545    
 
 On November 16, 1991, for example, a young Assyut resident was arrested 
by security forces and brought first to a police st ation in the city and held there for 
about a half-hour.  He then was moved to the SSI bu ilding and held there for 
another half-hour, and finally was transported with  fifteen others to the CSF camp 
outside the city, where he was tortured (see Chapte r Three for this account).  Poet 
Muhammed Afifi Mattar was arrested at his home in R amlet al-Anjab at 2:30 a.m. 
on March 2, 1991, and held in police detention at S hebien al-Kum until midday.  
From there he was brought directly to the Cairo hea dquarters of SSI, where he was 
held for ten days and tortured (see Appendix A for his account). 
 
 In other cases, the stay at a police station may b e longer and involve 
interrogation. On June 26, 1989, Dr. Muhammed Abd e l-Latif was arrested by 
security forces and brought first to a Cairo police  station.  Blindfolded and 
handcuffed, he was harshly questioned there for two  days. Then he was moved to 
SSI headquarters in Lazoughly, where he was held fo r five days and tortured (see 
Appendix C). 
 
 MEW also found that some suspects, mostly teenager s, are held for brief 
periods by SSI and then released without ever enter ing a police station, a 
prosecutor's office or a prison.  They are arrested , held incommunicado in SSI 
custody and tortured, and then released after hours  or at most several days. It is 
unclear in these cases whether there was a legal ba sis for the arrest and 
detention and whether the arrests were officially r ecorded.  
 
 Lawyers and family members typically can only conf irm that a person 
has been held incommunicado after the person is rel eased from SSI custody and 
transferred to a prison, when the details of the fi rst days of arrest then become 
known.  The first sign that incommunicado detention  is imminent occurs at the 
moment of arrest, when neither the detainee nor fam ily members present are 
informed by the officers in charge about where the detainee is being taken.  
Family members thus are forced to engage in a fruit less search, visiting police 
stations or attempting to speak with SSI officers a t SSI offices, only to be told that 
their husband or son is not there. 
 
 Lawyers reported to MEW that in some instances the y, too, "made the 
rounds" searching for a client, but never received confirmation of the person's 
whereabouts until he or she was transferred to and registered at a prison.  In one 
case, lawyers told MEW that they learned their clie nt was being held 
incommunicado at a CSF camp by someone who had just  been released.  The 
lawyers informed the prosecutor, who visited the ca mp but was told that the     46 46 4646    $$ $$    II IINCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO DD DDETENTIONETENTIONETENTIONETENTION     
 
person was not there.  
 
 MEW heard of no case in which the authorities ackn owledged to family 
members or lawyers that individuals were detained i n SSI offices or at CSF 
military camps, or gave them access to these facili ties.  From the perspective of 
the detainee -- who may be locked in small room, ha ndcuffed and blindfolded -- 
there is no possibility of getting out a message to  anyone about his whereabouts. 
Once in SSI custody, the isolation is total.  As on e journalist who was held 
incommunicado in SSI custody in October 1991 told M EW: "It's not possible to 
make contact with a lawyer.  Families search from p lace to place."     
 
 Contrary to statements made by Egypt's Prosecutor General and senior 
Interior Ministry officials, it is clear that incom municado detention by SSI in the 
days immediately following arrest is a long-standin g practice. In interviews with 
former detainees -- as well as those currently held  in prisons -- MEW found 
overwhelming evidence that individuals are held in SSI custody after arrest and 
prior to their transfer to prisons.  The practice d ates back at least to 1981; MEW 
interviewed prisoners at Tora Liman prison serving sentences for involvement in 
the Sadat assassination who noted that they had bee n brought to SSI 
headquarters at Lazoughly following their arrest. F or example, Muhammed Tarek 
Ibrahim, who was arrested in October 1981, said he spent one month at Lazoughly 
before he was transferred to the now-closed Citadel  prison in Cairo.1

 If the process of arrest is intimidating, the firs t hours and days of 
detention are rigorous.  Individuals often are blin dfolded during transit or before 
arrival at their initial place of detention and typ ically their hands are cuffed 
behind their backs.  Sometimes the blindfold and ha ndcuffs are applied after 
arrival at an SSI office or a police station.   
 
 The physical conditions of detention are crude and  humiliating, possibly 
designed to induce a weakened state prior to interr ogation by SSI officers or state 
prosecutors.  MEW found that appalling conditions p revail, irrespective of whether

a detainee is scheduled for SSI interrogation, or i s simply being held in SSI 
custody until he is brought to a Ministry of Justic e prosecutor for investigation. 
Detainees typically are deposited in small rooms wi th poor ventilation, devoid of 
mattresses, blankets and sanitary facilities. Somet imes they are held alone and 
sometimes with other detainees. Food is not supplie d regularly or in sufficent 
quantity, according to former detainess.  
 
 Dr. Ayman Ibrahim Taha, who was held and interroga ted at SSI 
headquarters in Lazoughly for six days in November 1991, told MEW that he 
received three meals a day, each consisting of one round loaf of Arabic bread with 
about fifty grams of ta'miyya  (fried ground fava beans).  He said that he was 
allowed to use the toilet once every sixteen hours.2 
   
 Journalist Salah Abd el-Maksoud was held for four days after his arrest in 
October 1991 at the SSI office in Giza.  "I was put  in a cell measuring 1x1.5 meters 
with no window.  It had no bed, no mattress, no bla nkets -- just the cold tile floor. I 
received one meal every twenty-four hours. "I was b lindfolded when taken from 
my cell for investigation, with my hands tied behin d my back,"  he told MEW.3  It 
was from this cell that he was brought to the state  security niyaba for questioning 
on the third day of his detention. 
 
 Former Member of Parliament Hassan al-Gamal told M EW that on the first 
night of his detention in October 1991 he was held in a basement room at 
Lazoughly.  He was led through a narrow passageway to an area with two adjacent 
spaces, each about 2x2.5 meters.  One of these spac es was shared at the time by 
twenty men. "It was dark.  There were no windows an d the air circulation was bad," 
he said.  "There was a toilet with no door and a ta p for water.  There were no 
blankets.  There were people who had been there for  weeks."4  
 
 Engineer Khalid Muhammed Ahmad Omar was arrested a t his Alexandria 
home on October 25, 1991 and was not seen by the ni yaba until October 31. Before 
he was brought to the niyaba, he spent three days i n a basement room at el-Laban

about 2x1.5 meters.  We had no food, no blankets.  The room flooded with sewage," 
he told MEW.5  
 
 MEW found that some detainees held in 1989 faced s imilar 
circumstances. After his arrest in the early mornin g hours of August 5, 1989 (see 
Chapter One), Dr. Abd el-Gawaad Sheishai, a univers ity professor of medicine, was 
held for three days in a room on the ground floor o f the SSI building in Mansoura.  
"It's the room where they put new people.  It's abo ut five meters by eight to nine 
meters and contains nothing except a few chairs.  T here are no beds or blankets."  
Dr. Sheishai was not interrogated by SSI officers d uring these three days.  "All they 
asked was whether I knew one name.  I told them yes , that the person was a 
colleague.  They asked no other questions." 
 
 He was then taken with five other men to Tanta in a small police vehicle 
with a 30x30 cm window. "Before we got out of the c ar, two men in civilian clothes 
came inside, blindfolded us, and cuffed our hands b ehind our backs."  The 
detainees were taken into a building and held somew here on the ground floor.  "I 
spent three days there....I counted the prayer call s to mark the passage of time.  
We were taken to the toilet blindfolded and handcuf fed.  All six of us were held 
together.  We could only speak with one another usi ng fast, whispered words. We 
were taken one at a time to the `investigation' roo m." 
 
 When he was brought for his interrogation his blin dfold and handcuffs 
were tightened.  "They took me by the arm only a fe w meters away, up three or four 
stairs.  While I was standing, someone asked whethe r I knew the name of one 
doctor.  They wanted to know what I knew about Shia  and Sunni ideas, and asked 
questions about religion.  This lasted twenty minut es to a half-hour."  He told MEW 
that during the three days, he was boxed on the chi n and face. 
 
 He was then taken to the police station in Tanta.  "My blindfold was 
removed and I was thrown into a small damp room. Af ter four days I was taken 
again for twenty minutes to a half-hour of addition al questioning."  After the fourth 
day, he was brought to Abu Za`bal prison.  He did n ot see a lawyer until his thirtieth 
day at the prison.  He was held at Abu Za`bal for f our months and released after the

 Appendix C of this report contains additional acco unts about conditions 
of detention from individuals held incommunicado in  1989.  Journalist Ahmed 
Ashof was arrested in September 1989 and was forced  to sleep for two weeks on 
the cement floor of his cell at Boulek Abu al-Ella prison before he was brought for 
interrogation at SSI headquarters. Dr. Sayd Fahmy e l-Shinawi, a surgeon in his 
sixties, was forced to stand for ten hours after ar riving at SSI headquarters in 
August 1989 and was allowed to use a toilet only on ce a day. Dr. Muhammed Abd 
el-Latif was held at SSI headquarters in June 1989,  bound and blindfolded for five 
days.  He was stripped of his clothes to his unders horts and forced to stand for 
forty hours, during which time his lower legs and f eet became very swollen.

 The most well-publicized location for incommunicad o detention is SSI 
headquarters in the Lazoughly Square district of do wntown Cairo. This area of the 
city bustles with activity during the day but is sp arsely populated at night, which 
perhaps explains perhaps why numerous detainees hav e reported that they were 
brought to Lazoughly in the middle of the night.  
 
 The headquarters building also is used by the SSI to hold, and sometimes 
torture, detainees who already have been admitted t o prisons. MEW collected 
information about the removal of detainees from pri sons, sometimes covered in 
blankets, to Lazoughly for periods of up to one wee k, after which time they are 
returned to prison (see Chapter Three).  Detainees also told MEW that they had 
been taken from prison by security forces after the ir court-ordered release and 
held incommunicado at Lazoughly until new detention  orders were issued (see 
Chapter Five for additional information).    
 
 In May 1990, senior Ministry of Interior officials  told MEW that 
administrative detainees are held in ordinary priso ns and denied flatly that they 
are held in military camps or other secret, unident ified places: "Definitely not."  
They did concede, however, that detainees may be he ld for hours, and at most only 
twenty-four hours, in SSI's building at Lazoughly:

  Sometimes they are investigated in the 
building behind us [SSI headquarters]. But we 
are not allowed to detain them here: maybe 
they are held for one day, sometimes only for 
two or three hours, but definitely not more 
than one day.7    
The officials explained to MEW that there are no fa cilities at Lazoughly for 
prisoners to be held for more than brief periods.  
 
 In  
February 1992, during a meeting with Egypt's Prosec utor General, Chancellor 
Raga'a el-Araby, MEW asked about the numerous repor ts of incommunicado 
detention at SSI 
headquarters in 
Lazoughly.  The 
Prosecutor General 
stated 
unequivocally that 
Lazoughly is an 
office building 
where SSI officers 
work and that "it is 
not a place of detention."8  MEW pointed out that there have been many reports  of 
individuals held in detention for days, and over a week, at Lazoughly.  "Don't say 
many," the Prosecutor General said impatiently. "Gi ve me proof of detention at 
Lazoughly."  He also noted that "the law and the Co nstitution prohibit absolutely 
the holding of anyone outside a prison."  MEW asked  Chancellor el-Araby if he 
wanted information about cases of detainees brought  to Lazoughly and other SSI 
offices. "Absolutely," he replied. "It will be give n serious consideration.  This is not 
a known complaint."

 In March 1992, MEW sent a letter to Chancellor el- Araby about fourteen 
cases of incommunicado detention at Lazoughly and o ther SSI offices in 1991 and 
early 1992. MEW requested information about these c ases, and asked the 
Prosecutor General to investigate the procedures an d practices used by SSI 
following arrests carried out by SSI officers and s oldiers.  As of the date of the 
publication of this report, MEW has not received a reply from Chancellor el-Araby.   
 
 The cases noted in MEW's letter to Prosecutor Gene ral el-Araby are 
described in various sections of this report, inclu ding cases of incommunicado 
detention and torture at SSI's Lazoughly headquarte rs.

 One complaint about detention at Lazoughly was so well-publicized that 
the detainee was released after thirteen days by a decision of President Hosni 
Mubarak. In 1989, a prominent appeals court judge, Chancellor Mahmoud Abd el-
Hamid Ghorab, complained about the arrest of his so n Nezar and his subsequent 
detention and torture at Lazoughly (see Chapter Fou r for his account).  MEW 
interviewed Nezar Ghorab, who is now a lawyer, in F ebruary 1992. He described the 
circumstances of his arrest and his transfer to SSI  headquarters: 
 
  A large force of SSI and CSF came at 2:00 a.m. 
on October 9 to my family's home.  My father 
opened the door.  They were openly carrying 
arms, asked to search the house and said 
they were arresting me.  My father said that 
this was not the proper legal procedure 
because they were in the house of a judge, 
but they insisted.  The officer in charge of the 
force gave a false name -- he turned out to be 
Col. Ibrahim Radwan.  He told my father they 
were taking me to the SSI office in Giza.9 
 
Nezar Ghorab was not taken to Giza, but first to Ag ouza Police Station.  "The 
detention cells there are not appropriate for anima ls and I was kept with

criminals,"  he recalled bitterly. The next morning , the transfer police10 took him to 
Tora Istikbal prison outside Cairo, where he was he ld in the visitors area.  "I was 
kept there until a SSI vehicle came, a microbus.  T hey handcuffed and blindfolded 
me and put me under the seat."  He was brought to S SI's building in Lazoughly and 
held there for the next six days.   
 
 How did he know he was in SSI headquarters if he w as blindfolded?  
"First, from the sound of the metro," he told MEW. "Second, if I was in the SSI 
building in Giza, there's a long winding staircase. ..you walk one flight up.  In 
Lazoughly, there's a lift.  Third, the interrogatin g officer told me: You're here in 
Lazoughly."

 The detention and torture of Cairo psychiatrist Dr . Muhammed Mustafa 
Mandour at Lazoughly in February 1991 generated int ernational attention.11  MEW 
discussed Dr. Mandour's ten-day period of incommuni cado detention with Interior 
Minister Mussa in February 1992.  The Minister told  MEW that he personally 
ordered Dr. Mandour's release, although the Ministe r was not forthcoming on the 
crucial but obviously sensitive subject of where Ma ndour was held for ten days 
prior to his transfer to prison.12  Both the Interior Minister and the Prosecutor 
General suggested to MEW that the burden was on Dr.  Mandour to prove that he 
was detained at Lazoughly for ten days after his ar rest by SSI officers at his home, 
which occurred in front of two witnesses in his fla t and terrified neighbors who 
watched from their windows. (See below for addition al information about Dr. 
Mandour's incommunicado detention.)

found, in a random search of the prison's six-cell punishment wing, a fifty-year-old 
housewife who had been detained incommunicado at La zoughly for ten days 
before being brought to the prison.  Fathiyya Sayyi d Muhammed el-Kurd, the 
mother of six children, told MEW that twenty-seven days earlier she had been 
taken from her home at 3:00 p.m. by plainclothes SS I officers who did not give 
their names.  She was brought to Lazoughly and held , blindfolded with her hands 
cuffed behind her back, in a fourth floor hallway.   
 
 Mrs. el-Kurd told MEW that she was tortured for ap proximately a half-hour

After her ordeal, she was brought directly to the w omen's prison and held in 
isolation in Room #1 of the punishment wing -- a sm all cell with no toilet, no

 The SSI office on Jabber Ibn Hayan Street in the D okki district of Giza also 
is used for incommunicado detention after arrest. T wo men who were arrested by 
security forces in October 1991, for example, were first held for four days in the 
Giza office before being transferred to Tora Istikb al prison.   
 
 Salah Abd el-Maksoud, who has worked as a journali st for twelve years 
and lives in Giza, was arrested at his home at 3:00  a.m. on October 25, 1991.  After 
security forces searched his house and seized books , papers, published articles 
and drafts of articles, he was brought to SSI's Giz a branch and held there for four 
days. "It was not possible to make contact with a l awyer or my family," he told 
MEW.  "When I was taken from this cell to be interr ogated, my hands were tied 
behind my back and I was blindfolded."13

night.  He said he was unable to sleep with his han ds cuffed behind his back. When 
he was taken for interrogation he was brought to an  upstairs room. He was held in 
the Giza office for three days and then moved to To ra Istikbal prison.14 
 
 Neither of these two men were subjected to physica l abuse in the Giza 
office, in contrast to Assam Abd al-Monem al-Gundi,  a veterinarian who lives in the 
Imbaba section of Cairo.  He told MEW that he was a rrested in November 1990 and 
first taken to the SSI building in Giza, where he w as blindfolded.  During his 
interrogation he was beaten, hit on the head, subje cted to electric shocks, and 
suspended over a door from under his arms, which we re tied behind his back. He 
was moved from this SSI office to Tora Istikbal pri son, where MEW interviewed 
him.15  He has never been charged with an offense.  MEW a lso took testimony from 
journalist Adil el-Ansari, who was arrested on Janu ary 2, 1992 and beaten at the 
Giza SSI office (see Chapter Three). 
 
 Several of the Palestinians who have been held in long-term detention at 
Abu Za`bal Liman prison, some since the early month s of the Gulf crisis in 1990,

State Security in Zifta," he told MEW.  "They moved  me to the SSI building in Tanta, 
where I was blindfolded and my hands were cuffed be hind my back."  He was

 Egyptian human rights monitors reported to MEW tha t over the last few 
years the SSI has used Central Security Forces mili tary camps for incommunicado 
detention and torture. Reports have been received a bout the SSI's use of CSF 
camps near the cities of Assyut and Fayoum, and in the camp at Hurghada, north of 
Safaja on the Red Sea coast.   
 
 Gen. Mahmoud Fakarani, the head of the Ministry of  Interior's Prisons 
Administration, denied that CSF camps are used as d etention centers.  He did 
concede, however, that individuals may be held at t hese camps for a maximum of 
two to three days, "while a force is prepared to ta ke them to prison."18  However,

MEW found cases of detention and torture at one CSF  camp near Assyut in which 
detainees were released after their ordeals and nev er brought to a prison.  
 
The Camps in AssyutThe Camps in AssyutThe Camps in AssyutThe Camps in Assyut    
 
 According to defense lawyers in Assyut, Central Se curity Forces camps 
were first used for detention in 1981, after the as sassination of President Sadat in 
October of that year, but the practice did not beco me widespread because there 
were few mass arrests thereafter.  The use of the c amps began to increase in the 
late 1980s when arrests by security forces were aga in on the rise.  In Assyut, the 
CSF camp most 
frequently used for 
detention is 
located near 
Abnoub, in a 
military area on the 
east bank of the 
Nile, about four 
kilometers north of Assyut.  Lawyers say that there  are occasional cases of 
detention at el-Moutarda camp, in the eastern part of Assyut, and noted that it is 
"quite rare" for detention to take place at the thi rd CSF camp, located in 
Manqabad, ten km north of Assyut.  
 
 "Anyone in Assyut can be arrested and taken to one  of these camps," one 
lawyer told MEW.  "The camp near Abnoub is mainly u sed now," said another 
lawyer. "Before this, the Second Police Station of Assyut was used. The niyaba 
knows what is happening in these camps.  But from 1 991 until now, the niyaba 
visited Abnoub only ten times, although over 200 co mplaints about detention 
there were presented by lawyers to this niyaba.  Si nce 1991, over 300 people have 
been brought to this camp. In most cases, the niyab a just telephones the camp 
and asks if a person is there.  Usually they deny t hat the person is being held."19   
 This happened in the case of six students who were  taken from 
examination rooms at the University of Assyut on Ap ril 14, 1991, arrested, and 
brought to the camp near Abnoub, where they were to rtured.20  On the second day

     20The students' names are Salah Mahmoud el-Baram, Amr  Kamal Eddin Mahmoud, Karam 
Ahmad Diab, Fayez Ahmed Abdul Khalek, Ali Mohammed Abdalla -- all from the agricultural "Since 1991, over 300 people have been brought to 
this camp.  Usually they deny that the person is be ing 
held."       58 585858    $$ $$    II IINCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO DD DDETENTIONETENTIONETENTIONETENTION     
 
of their detention, lawyers went to the niyaba and complained, after one student 
who had been released told the lawyers where the ot hers were being held. The 
niyaba went to the camp at 2:00 p.m. the same day b ut could not find the students. 
"They put detainees in cars," one lawyer explained.   "As soon as the niyaba comes, 
the detainees are moved."  He said that this happen ed with Mahmoud Ahmed 
Shayeb, who was held this way at the camp following  his arrest on January 13, 
1990.  Lawyers had complained to the niyaba about S hayeb's detention at the 
camp, and he was moved around in a car for days so the niyaba could not find him. 
 "For three days, he was hanged from his handcuffed  wrists to the roof of a car and 
given no food at all," said one attorney familiar w ith Shayeb's case (see Chapter 
Five for additional information about Shayeb).   
 
 MEW interviewed Ahmad Thabet Muhammed, who was tor tured at the CSF 
camp after his arrest on November 27, 1991.  During  his detention, he was moved 
from his cell and held for three days in a car, whe re he received medical care for 
injuries he sustained during torture (see Chapter T hree for his account). 
 
 After arrest, a detainee is not necessarily taken directly to the camp but 
may spend some time first at a police station or SS I's office in Assyut. MEW 
interviewed a young Assyut worker, Khalid Sayyid Ma hmoud, who was brought to 
the camp near Abnoub on November 16, 1991. After hi s arrest, he was taken first to 
a police station with a group of about fifteen othe rs who had been arrested: "After 
about a half-hour at the police station, they calle d our names and took us to the 
SSI building, where we stayed another thirty minute s.  They only asked our names. 
 Then we were taken to the soldiers' camp." 
 
 The following description of the camp emerges from  interviews with 
former detainees who have been held there: 
 
 The camp's entrance is through a gate off the main  road. The soldiers' 
barracks are on the banks of the Nile, about one km  away. To the right of the 
camp's main gate are two adjacent buildings of ceme nt construction, with a small 
fountain in front. Near the fountain is a small roo m where personal belongings are 
stored. The two buildings contain cells measuring a bout 3.5x2 meters, with 
ceilings about five meters high. (It is believed th ese buildings were designed as a 
prison for soldiers.)  Attached to one of the build ings is a bathroom with no door,

measuring one meter by 50 cm.  Next to one of the b uildings is a small cell, 
measuring one by two meters, which contains no toil et. 
 
 To the left of the camp's gate is a two-story buil ding that serves as a 
hospital, with five 3x3 meter rooms on the second f loor, each containing only a 
desk and a chair. Detainees are removed from cells and taken to the second floor 
of the hospital for interrogation and torture.  Acc ounts of torture in the hospital 
appear in the next chapter. 
 
The Camp at HurghadaThe Camp at HurghadaThe Camp at HurghadaThe Camp at Hurghada    
 
 On September 25, 1991, lawyer El-Shadly Ebeid al-S aghir was arrested by 
the SSI in Safaga on the Red Sea, and brought to th e CSF camp in Hurghada, north 
of Safaga on the coast.21  He was tortured at the camp with four others befo re he 
was transferred, after four days, to Tora Istikbal prison.  He was released after two 
months. This was the lawyer's second detention at t he Hurghada camp.  After his 
arrest on June 7, 1991, he was brought to the camp,  held for ten days, and tortured.22 
 
The Camp in FayoumThe Camp in FayoumThe Camp in FayoumThe Camp in Fayoum    
 
 Another Central Security Forces camp, described by  one rights monitor 
as "the worst prison" in the country, is in al-`Aza b, a town south of the city of 
Fayoum.  In April 1990, following a violent clash o n April 30 between security 
forces and members of a militant breakaway Islamist  group in the village of Kakh 
in the Ibshaway district near Fayoum -- which left at least fourteen Islamists dead 
and a dozen security-force personnel injured23 -- there were mass arrests in the 
area.  Defense lawyer Youssef Saqr told MEW: "By th e end of the first week, about 
100 people were arrested.  Anyone who was suspected  was taken.  The SSI 
arrested anyone who could be traced to Islamic grou ps in Ibshaway. People went 
into hiding and then their wives, sisters and mothe rs were taken as hostages.  The 
village of Kahk was surrounded and anyone with a be ard was arrested.  Altogether,

between 400 and 500 people were arrested."24  He said that the detainees were 
first held in the Ibshaway police station and then the men were taken to al-`Azab 
camp.  He told MEW that lawyers secured permission from Cairo to visit detainees 
at the camp, but when they arrived they were not pe rmitted to enter. 
 
 MEW interviewed one resident of Fayoum who was bro ught to al-`Azab 
camp in September 1987 and tortured there. He requi red hospital treatment for an 
injury sustained during his torture and was returne d to the camp after spending 
six weeks in Fayoum hospital, incommunicado and und er armed guard (see 
Appendix C for this account).

 As the testimony in the next chapter indicates, al l the torture victims 
interviewed by MEW, with one exception, stated that  they were abused while held 
incommunicado in SSI custody at SSI offices or at m ilitary camps of the Central 
Security Forces.  (The exception is the case of Bah a'a Fouad Buktur, an Egyptian 
Christian, who was tortured by SSI personnel at a p olice station in Heliopolis; this 
case is discussed in detail in Chapter Four.25)  In addition to victims who were 
tortured during interrogation immediately following  arrest,  MEW also obtained 
accounts from detainees who had been removed from p risons, taken to SSI's 
Lazoughly headquarters building and tortured, and t hen returned to prison (an 
issue discussed in the next chapter).  Egyptian gov ernment officials refuse to give 
                                                                    
     24MEW interview, Cairo, February 2, 1992. 
     25The issue of systematic mistreatment and torture of  individuals held at Egyptian police 
stations is beyond the scope of this report, althou gh this is a human rights problem 
deserving attention and scrutiny.  As one Egyptian defense lawyer told MEW in a January 
1992 interview: "Especially in poor neighborhoods, the police ignore citizens' rights.  Police 
officers are very tough.  There is a list of crimes  and no evidence and no suspects.  They 
need to find someone to fill their files.  Torture at police stations is explained less by 
corruption than by the needs of the police to obtai n information, witnesses and evidence."  
See  EOHR, "The Mistreatment of Citizens and Torture in  Police Stations," November 20, 1990.  
A January 1992 EOHR report contains three cases of torture at police stations that included 
sexual abuse; also see  EOHR, "The Campaign to Stop Torture, Statement #3,  Rape and Sexual 
Abuse as Methods of Torture."     I I IINCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO DD DDETENTION ETENTION ETENTION ETENTION $$ $$    6161 6161    
 
credence to these reports, and likewise refuse to a cknowledge the periods of 
incommunicado detention prior to detainees' transfe r to prisons.  Detainees held 
under these circumstances -- such as the three tort ure victims whose cases are 
described below -- are temporarily "disappeared" pe rsons.  
 
 In meetings with MEW representatives in February 1 992, senior 
government officials stressed that SSI does not hol d detainees for days or weeks 
prior to their transfer to prisons.  Interior Minis ter Moussa told MEW that 
immediately following arrest, a detainee is placed in the custody of the Prisons 
Administration,26  but this clearly has not been the case for scores  of detainees. 
Chancellor Raga'a el-Araby, the Prosecutor General,  denied any knowledge of the 
practice of incommunicado detention.27  He added that if such a practice were 
taking place, it would constitute a crime under Egy ptian law.28   
 
 MEW found that government officials, to deny knowl edge of 
incommunicado detention by SSI, must likewise deny knowledge of the 
whereabouts of individuals in the first days after their arrest.  The record-keeping 
system at prisons facilitates this studied ignoranc e about where a detainee was 
initially held after arrest.  With the consent of p rison officials, MEW looked at one 
of the log books at Tora Istikbal prison during a v isit to the facility on February 16, 
1992.  The book listed a person's name, prisoner nu mber, age, occupation, court 
sentence (if relevant), and the place from which th e person had been transferred.  
In cases of administrative detention, only the numb er and date of the detention

     27MEW interview, Cairo, February 5, 1992. 
     28Egyptian law does, however, empower the Minister of  Interior to hold detainees in 
places other than prisons.  In 1968, the law govern ing prisons, Law No. 396 of 1956, was 
amended to include Article 1A, which states that an y detainee may be held in a prison or in 
"any of the places to be specified in a decision by  the interior minister." ( See  Abdallah 
Khalil and Amir Salem, Prisons in Egypt , Cairo: 1991, MEW translation from the original 
Arabic.)  The amendment further states that all pro visions of the prisons law apply to these 
supplemental places of detention with one exception : "the right to enter them ... is limited to 
the prosecutor general or any subordinate he delega tes, with the rank of district 
prosecutor or higher."  ( Ibid .)

order was listed, not the date of arrest.  This obs cured any gap between the date of 
arrest and the date of arrival at the prison. 
 
 MEW tried to obtain answers from government offici als about where 
torture victims had been initially held after arres t by security forces -- information 
that is needed to determine who was responsible for  the alleged mistreatment.

 Dr. Muhammed Mandour was arrested by security forc es at his home in 
the early morning hours of February 8, 1991.  He wa s taken to SSI headquarters in 
Lazoughly Square and tortured; he was held incommun icado at the SSI office from 
February 8 until his transfer to Abu Za`bal Industr ial Prison on the morning of 
February 17.  But computer records at the Prisons A dministration headquarters in 
Cairo indicated that the date of Dr. Mandour's dete ntion order was February 17, ten 
days after his actual arrest and period of incommun icado detention. Not one 
government official interviewed by MEW could explai n where Dr. Mandour was 
held for the first ten days after his arrest. 
 
 It is clear that Dr. Mandour was arrested by secur ity forces at the time 
when he and two witnesses at his home said he was: after midnight on February 7, 
1991.  Dr. Mandour serves on the Board of Trustees of the Egyptian Organization for 
Human Rights (EOHR), which learned of his arrest an d sent, by facsimile, its first 
appeal about his case in a communique dated Februar y 8, 1991.  On February 11, 
MEW sent a letter by facsimile to Egyptian Presiden t Hosni Mubarak about Dr. 
Mandour's arrest.  The next day, MEW sent additiona l letters about the case by 
facsimile to the U.S. ambassador in Cairo, the U.S.  State Department in Washington, 
journalists, U.S.-based human rights organizations and others. According to the 
computer records at the Prisons Administration, Dr.  Mandour had not yet been 
detained at the time this correspondence was being written and circulated, yet no 
Egyptian government official at the time told MEW t hat he challenged the factual 
premise of the correspondence. 
 
 When MEW later asked about initial place of detent ion of Dr. Mandour, the 
Prosecutor General suggested that MEW ask the Inter ior Minister.  The Interior 
Minister told MEW to inquire with the prison author ities.  But prison commanders     I I IINCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO NCOMMUNICADO DD DDETENTION ETENTION ETENTION ETENTION $$ $$    63636363    
 
and senior Prisons Administration officials said th at the location of detainees 
prior to transfer to prison was neither their conce rn nor their responsibility. For 
example, a senior Prisons Administration inspector,  when asked directly about 
allegations of torture by SSI, did not deny that to rture occurred but told MEW:  
"Torture by State Security is not our responsibilit y.  The people who come to take 
them, they're responsible."29  
 
 Gen. Mahmoud Fakarani, the director of the Interio r Ministry's Prisons 
Administration, said in an interview: "It is not my  concern where the prisoner is 
coming from.  I'm only concerned that there is a le gal reason for someone to be in 
a prison."30  In a subsequent interview, Gen. Fakarani told MEW  that "there must be 
a detention order" before security forces arrest an  individual.31  He explained that 
a detention order remains undated until the person is in custody because 
"sometimes an order is issued but the person is esc aped or in hiding."  In such 
cases, the detention order is dated when the person  is apprehended.  Such 
flexibility with detention order dates creates an o pportunity for abuse, since if 
security forces want to hold someone in unacknowled ged incommunicado 
detention, they need only show an arrest date that is later than the actual date of 
custody. 
 
 After a meeting at Prisons Administration headquar ters, officials showed 
MEW the computer system that contains information a bout every detainee and 
prisoner in Egypt, and permitted access to several individual files.32  Each 
individual file contained the following data: name,  address, nationality, birth date, 
prison serial number, detention order number, date of arrest, date of transfer to 
prison, and date of expiration of the detention ord er or date of release.

 MEW requested that Dr. Mandour's file be pulled up  on the computer 
screen, in order to determine whether the informati on in the computer records 
corresponded with what Dr. Mandour said happened to  him after arrest.  The file 
indicated that Dr. Mandour was detained pursuant to  Detention Order No. 408/91, 
dated February 17, 1991.  The computer also showed that he was received at Abu 
Za`bal Prison on February 17, 1991 and released on February 24, 1991. February 17 is 
the date when Dr. Mandour was moved to Abu Za`bal p rison from SSI headquarters 
-- it was not the date of his arrest.  Dr. Mandour' s ten-day period of incommunicado 
detention, prior to this date, was not noted in his  computer file.

 Unlike the case of Dr. Mandour, the incommunicado detention of Fathiyya 
el-Kurd for ten days at SSI headquarters did not ge nerate international attention 
because the fifty-year-old Cairo housewife was not prominent, and no one except 
her family knew of her arrest on the afternoon of J anuary 20, 1992.  Yet Mrs. el-Kurd 
told MEW a story that was similar in its details to  Dr. Mandour's.  If her allegations 
are true, and MEW has no reason to believe that the y are not because she was a 
credible witness, then the date of her detention or der also was post-dated to 
erase the period of her incommunicado detention, as  in Dr. Mandour's case. 
 
 After Mrs. el-Kurd's arrest by security forces on January 20, she said that 
she was taken to SSI headquarters in Lazoughly, bli ndfolded, held for ten days, and 
tortured (see Chapter Three for her account).  She then was transferred to a 
punishment cell at Qanater women's prison, where ME W interviewed her on her 
seventeenth day there.33  
 
 After viewing Dr. Mandour's computer file, MEW ask ed to see Mrs. el-
Kurd's.  As was the case with Dr. Mandour, her ten days of incommunicado 
detention at Lazoughly were not indicated in her re cords.  According to the data 
displayed by the computer, Mrs. el-Kurd was arreste d on January 29, 1992 by SSI, 
pursuant to Detention Order No. 1778, dated January  29, 1992 -- that is, nine days 
after she stated she had been taken from her home a nd detained.  The records 
indicated that she was transferred to Qanater priso n on February 1, 1992.

 MEW raised this case at a meeting with Interior Mi nister Moussa, on the

 Although the Interior Minister was unable to provi de MEW with information 
immediately, several days later Prisons Administrat ion Director Gen. Fakarani

 MEW learned from lawyers in Assyut of a third case  of detention that was 
unacknowledged by the authorities.  The lawyers wer e expressing their 
frustration with attempts to complain about the pat tern of incommunicado 
detention at the CSF military camp near Abnoub, out side the city.  "Usually when 
we complain to the niyaba, the security forces know , and hide or move the 
detainees," one lawyer told MEW.35   Two lawyers who represented Medhat al-
Sayyid Ahmad, a twenty-year-old who was arrested an d brought to the CSF camp 
on November 15, 1991, used his case as an illustrat ion of the obstacles 
encountered when filing a "disappearance" complaint  with the niyaba. (See 
Chapter Three for al-Sayyid's allegations of tortur e.)   
 
 "In this case, we made four complaints to differen t niyabas," one lawyer 
said.  The lawyers presented their first complaint to the head of the niyaba on 
November 17, two days after their client was arrest ed.  They submitted a second 
complaint four days later, this one to the general prosecutor for the Assyut 
governorate.  Each complaint expressed fear that al -Sayyid would be tortured.  On 
November 23, the day that al-Sayyid was removed fro m incommunicado detention 
and presented to the niyaba, the lawyers wrote two additional complaints: one to 
the president of the niyaba, and the other to the l ocal niyaba.   
 
 When al-Sayyid was brought to the niyaba on Novemb er 23, the ninth day 
of his detention, the lawyers raised the point that  he had been arrested on 
November 17, eight days earlier.  "The niyaba asked  us to bring evidence of this."  
The lawyers explained to the niyaba that their evid ence was the first written

complaint of "disappearance" made to the niyaba on November 17, two days after 
al-Sayyid's arrest.  The lawyers told MEW that an o fficial at the criminal 
investigation office denied that al-Sayyid had been  detained at the CSF camp on 
this date. 
 
 The lawyers got nowhere. They told MEW that the of ficial documents in al-
Sayyid's case stated that he was arrested on Novemb er 23, the day he appeared 
before the niyaba.  The records further indicated t hat it was only on November 22 
that the security forces obtained permission from t he niyaba to arrest al-Sayyid, 
when in fact he had been arrested on the afternoon of November 15.  As in the 
cases of Dr. Mandour and Mrs. el-Kurd, the period o f as-Sayyid's incommunicado 
detention after his arrest -- the period when he wa s tortured -- was 
unacknowledged by the authorities.  As in the previ ous two cases, this period of 
unacknowledged detention by the authorities is a te mporary "disappearance."     3 3 33

 After arrest, political and security suspects ofte n are first interrogated 
by State Security Investigation officers while held  blindfolded and 
incommunicado in SSI custody for days, and sometime s for over a week, before 
being transferred to a prison.  
 
 SSI interrogations are designed to obtain informat ion, to elicit 
confessions, to recruit informers, or simply to int imidate and threaten individuals 
because of their perceived political -- and sometim es religious -- beliefs, 
affiliations or activities.  In some cases, the int errogators' line of questioning is 
pointed and specific, but in other cases the questi ons are of a general nature.  
Although not every political suspect detained by SS I is tortured while held 
incommunicado and questioned, torture frequently is  an element in the SSI 
interrogation process.  
 
 Egyptian government officials have consistently de nied that detainees 
are tortured in custody.  Significantly, these offi cials even deny that SSI officers 
conduct days-long interrogations of political detai nees and security suspects 
while held incommunicado in SSI custody. Interior M inister Muhammed Abdel 
Halim Moussa told MEW in a February 1992 interview that his ministry "is not an 
investigating and interrogating authority."  Regard ing the State Security 
Investigation department specifically, he said: "SS I is not an investigating 
authority ... the niyaba from the Ministry of Justi ce does the investigation."  Later in 
the same conversation, however, Minister Moussa con ceded that SSI "gathers 
information and evidence."  He stated that this inf ormation-gathering process 
takes place "in [SSI] officers' offices for politic al offenses."  He did not provide 
additional details.    
 
 Despite the Minister's claims, the testimony in th is chapter indicates that 
SSI officers clearly have access to detainees for e xtended periods, and use this     70 70 7070    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE     
 
access for a variety of purposes, ranging from gene ral questioning about political 
beliefs, acquaintances and affiliations to full-fle dged torture sessions aimed at 
securing information or confessions.   
 
 The detail and consistency of the testimony leaves  little doubt that 
Egyptian security authorities detain individuals in communicado at specific 
locations throughout the country and, in numerous c ases, have tortured detainees 
with impunity. The cumulative weight and detail of scores of cases, over a period 
of years, is suggestive not merely of a practice, b ut of a government-sanctioned 
policy.

 Allegations of torture are "absolutely contrary to  the truth," Egypt's 
Interior Minister Gen. Muhammed Abdel Halim Moussa told MEW in February 1992.  
Senior officials from both the Ministry of Interior  and the Ministry of Justice, in 
denying persistent allegations of torture, have sta ted that detainees fabricate 
stories to save themselves from conviction in a cou rt of law.  "A criminal, 
especially after contact with his lawyer, may say h e was tortured in order to obtain 
a benefit in the eyes of the court.  This is not a new trick, we all know it," a senior 
Interior Ministry official told MEW in May 1990.1  Only one senior Prisons 
Administrations officer spoke frankly with MEW.  Wh en asked directly about 
allegations of torture by SSI, he did not deny that  torture occurred, but said: 
"Torture by State Security is not our responsibilit y.  The people who come to take 
them, they're responsible."2 
 
 "Our law gives the accused the right to lie as one  of the ways of

defending himself," Prosecutor General Raga' el-Ara by said to MEW in February 
1992.  "From my experience as a prosecutor, the acc used begin their defense by 
focusing attention on those who detained them in or der to escape punishment.  
But in most cases the court rejects this.  I hope t his concept is understood," he 
emphasized.3   
 
 Confessions that defense lawyers claim were coerce d under torture are 
a regular feature of political trials in Egypt.4  But the Prosecutor General's 
comments do not account for the scores of allegatio ns of torture made by 
detainees who have been held incommunicado, interro gated and tortured, and 
then released without a confession being taken or a  charge being filed.  Because 
there is no confession in these cases, detainees ha ve no motivation to fabricate a 
description of torture in order to have confessions  invalidated by a court. Almost 
all of the testimony in this report about torture w as taken from former detainees 
who had not signed a confession and facing legal pr oceedings before a court. 
 
 An Egyptian lawyer who has studied torture told ME W that he believes 
torture in Egypt serves two purposes: to obtain inf ormation, and to deter, punish 
and harm groups that mount unacceptable challenges to the political system.  The 
first dates back to Interior Minister Hassan Abu Ba sha (who served from January 
1982 to October 1984); the second was instituted un der Interior Minister Zaki Badr 
(March 1986 to January 1990).  Torture continues to  be used in Egypt for both 
purposes.   
 
 "Torture for information started with the Sadat as sassination, under 
Interior Minister Hassan Abu Basha," the lawyer sai d.  "The security system really 
had no information about the Jihad Organization, an d torture of a large number of 
people was used to obtain information about the gro up's leadership and methods 
of operation. This was successful and weakened the organization significantly 
until it began to renew itself in 1985 and 1986. To rture thus became 
institutionalized into the interrogation process."5

 Interior Minister Zaki Badr used torture to deter or punish groups that 
represented a challenge to the system.  "For exampl e, information was not needed 
from the Helwan workers who were tortured in 1989.6  But the policy of the political 
security apparatus is to keep things under control.   The government, for example, 
knows the active leadership of the Muslim Brotherho od.  But when the 
Brotherhood splits from the government line, as it did on the Madrid peace 
conference, some of its members are taken in and to rtured. There are no 
investigative purposes for this torture,"  the lawy er said. This analysis suggests 
that torture also is used as a mechanism to define the limits of acceptable 
political activity.   
 
 MEW obtained accounts of torture presumptively use d for both purposes, 
although the greater number of accounts were taken from individuals who were 
abused because their interrogators were seeking spe cific or general information. 
 As noted in the last section of this chapter,  MEW  found that SSI does not subject 
every detainee to torture during interrogations; in  some cases, information is 
sought or personal politics are challenged without resort to physical abuse.  
When torture is used, MEW found that the choice of victims follows no pattern and 
that the likelihood of torture occurring is not pla ce-specific.  We have collected 
detailed testimony indicating that torture has been  used at every location where 
State Security Investigation holds detainees incomm unicado, and that torture 
victims include a diverse range of individuals -- p rofessionals, workers, 
shopkeepers, university students, teenagers, even a  housewife -- ranging from 
seventeen to fifty-five years old.     
 
 Some Egyptian lawyers and human rights monitors ar e convinced that 
SSI officers are trained in interrogation technique s that include torture. "There's a 
style, a system," one lawyer told MEW. MEW was unab le to obtain information 
about where and how Egyptian security forces are tr ained in torture techniques, 
but we did find a similarity in the types of tortur e used at SSI offices around the 
country, suggesting some common training.

 Torture typically occurs after victims have been s tripped to their 
underwear.  In some cases, detainees are forced to confront their interrogators

totally naked. They may be forced to stand long per iods prior to interrogation, or 
held in cells that lack mattresses and blankets, ma king it difficult or impossible to 
sleep.  They also may be deprived of regular suppli es of food and water. But the 
almost-universal prelude to torture in Egypt is bli ndfolding of the eyes and cuffing 
of the hands, usually behind the back. 
 
BlindfoldingBlindfoldingBlindfoldingBlindfolding 
 
 Egyptian Interior Minister Moussa told MEW that bl indfolding is not 
allowed under the rules governing the conduct of in terrogations. "They don't tie 
the eyes," he said.  "If blindfolding is used, of c ourse an officer would be 
disciplined."7 
 
 Despite the Minister's words, MEW found that in vi rtually every case of 
SSI incommunicado detention involving torture, deta inees have been constantly 
blindfolded. This practice, of course, also prevent s the victims from seeing and 
later identifying their torturers.   
 Dr. Muhammed Mandour, the Cairo psychiatrist who w as tortured in 
February 1991 at SSI's Lazoughly building, told MEW  that he was blindfolded before 
he was brought inside the facility and remained bli ndfolded during his ten-day 
detention there.  "When you are suddenly blinded, i t makes you very weak.  
Immediately, you become very helpless," he said.  " Whenever blindfolding is used, 
it should be considered the equivalent of torture. Long-term blindfolding induces 
a debilitated psychological state and prevents you from seeing and identifying 
your tormentors. In Egypt, even when forensic evide nce proves torture, all that 
happens is financial compensation.  There is no ind ividual punishment because 
the torturer cannot be identified."8 
 
 Blindfolding for lengthy periods can cause physica l pain and injury. 
Muhammed Afifi Mattar, the prominent Egyptian poet,  was arrested at his home 
after midnight on March 2, 1991.  The next morning he was brought to SSI 
headquarters at Lazoughly and held there for ten da ys.  In June 1991, he wrote 
about his torture at Lazoughly, including a descrip tion of the physical pain and 
injury caused by his blindfold.

 Mattar's blindfold was thick and elastic, covering  his ears and eyes; its 
position never changed, "making the spontaneous mov ement of the eyes one of 
severe pain ... and inflam[ing] the flesh of the ea rs."  The knot of his blindfold 
caused additional pain and an injury: 
 
  The knot of the blindfold pressured the skull 
from the back, a pressure that deadens 
sensation in the skin.  As a result of beating 
and the sudden throwing of the body flat on 
the floor, the knot of the blindfold sank slowly, 
slowly, inside the skin of the head.   
 
  This resulted in a deep wound in the back of 
my head, big enough to insert two fingers 
inside.  This wound continued to bleed and 
ooze for more than a month and a half until it 
healed.  It left a scar which still can be seen 
and felt.  All this also caused disorientation 
and severe weakness in the sight in my right 
eye.9 
 
 During MEW's 1990 mission to Egypt, physician Dr. Robert S. Lawrence, a 
member of the delegation, interviewed journalist Ah mad Ashof, who was arrested 
in September 1989 and held for ten days at Lazoughl y, where he was tortured (see 
Appendix C for this account).  Dr. Lawrence examine d Mr. Ashof and found a well-
healed .2x1.5 cm scar across the bridge of his nose , consistent with the 
journalist's report that he had been tightly blindf olded at Lazoughly for more than 
a week.10

 In February 1992, MEW interviewed Abd al-Nasser Za her Bilal, a twenty-
eight-year-old Palestinian student from the Univers ity of Alexandria, in his cell at 
Abu Za`bal Liman prison.  He said that he has been held at the prison without 
charge since his arrest in September 1990. He was w earing eyeglasses with black 
frames and thick 
lenses when he 
spoke to MEW.  
Before he was 
transferred to 
prison, he was held 
for twenty days at 
the SSI building in 
Alexandria, 
continuously 
blindfolded.  "Before I was arrested I suffered fro m some problems in my eyes, for 
which I wore soft contact lenses.  At the SSI offic e, they tied my eyes with a tight 
blindfold for twenty days, on top of my lenses, whi ch should have been removed," 
he said. The pressure of the blindfold on top of th e contact lenses over the twenty-
day period caused infection and swelling in his eye s.  "I was brought to Abu Za`bal 
and my condition started to deteriorate, until I lo st sight in my right eye. Now I am 
about to lose sight in my left eye."11  
 
 Dr. Ayman Ibrahim Taha, a physician who was beaten  and threatened at 
Lazoughly for six days in November 1991, told MEW: "My blindfold had three knots, 
one at the back and one on either side of my head, so I was unable to sleep."12  
Nezar Ghorab, a young lawyer who was held and tortu red at Lazoughly in October 
1989, remembered that "one of the most difficult th ings about being in Lazoughly 
was being blindfolded and handcuffed the entire tim e ... when you eat, when you 
wash, when you go to the toilet."13

 Detainees typically are handcuffed while interroga ted.  Sometimes the 
cuffs are moved from the front to the back specific ally for interrogation sessions. 
(This ensures that the detainee cannot reach up, pu ll off his blindfold, and see his 
interrogators.) Some detainees told MEW about parti cularly painful handcuffs that 
tighten when the hands are moved. One Egyptian doct or said that this can cause 
cutaneous nerve-tissue damage.  Muhammed Afifi Matt ar wrote that his metal 
handcuffs tightened at the wrist at the slightest m ovement, "transforming the 
hands, arms and shoulders into an interlocking mass  of pain."  Dr. Muhammed 
Mandour wrote that his handcuffs at Lazoughly had t eeth "and whenever you make 
a move the teeth become tighter and tighter ... As days went by, this caused 
pressure and affected the sensation in my left thum b, accompanied by pain in 
both hands."

 After the victim is blindfolded and handcuffed, ME W found that any of the 
following methods of physical and psychological abu se may occur, in a variety of 
combinations and sequences:  
 
!  beating and kicking, including beating with stick s or other hard objects, by one 
or more individuals. 
 
!  enforced standing for long periods. 
 
!  suspension from bound wrists for long periods, ei ther with the feet touching the 
ground and supporting the body's weight or -- more painful -- with the feet off the 
ground and the body's weight supported from the wri sts. 
 
!  binding the hands and feet around a pole placed a bove the forearms and 
behind the knees, with the pole supported between t wo chairs while the soles and 
tops of the feet are beaten with a blunt object. 
 
!  electric-shocking either while standing or while held to the floor with a chair 
(the pain of electric shocks may be exacerbated by dousing the victim with water 
prior to the administration of the shocks). 
 
!  psychological torture, designed to produce a stat e of fear and uncertainty.  
Techniques include interrogators' emphasis that det ainees' whereabouts in 
custody are not known; degrading insults and curses , and the use of language     I I IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTURE ORTURE ORTURE ORTURE $$ $$    7777 7777    
 
offensive to religious Muslims; threats to inflict torture or sexual abuse on 
detainees or female family members, including wives ; threats to arrest family 
members; exposure to screams which some detainees b elieved were tape-
recorded; and the general anxiety produced by waiti ng long periods -- while 
experiencing sensory deprivation -- for the next in terrogation and torture session 
to commence.  The vulnerability generated by variou s methods of psychological 
torture is only heightened by detainees' constant b lindfolding and, often, the 
removal of their clothing.  
 
MEW also collected information about detainees who were sexually abused by 
their interrogators.  This issue also was the subje ct of a report issued by EOHR in 
January 1992.14 
 
 Detainees may be tied, blindfolded and beaten, or subjected to more 
severe methods of physical abuse.  Two cases from 1 992 exemplify the extremes 
of treatment during short-term incommunicado detent ion, followed by the release 
of detainees without charge: 
 
 Journalist Adil el-Ansari, who has worked for thre e years with the 
monthly al-Mukhtar Islami , was arrested at his home at 2:00 a.m. on January 2, 
1992 by security forces wearing civilian clothes. H e was taken first to the police 
station in Balah al-Takour and held in a cell with common criminals. The next day, 
he was brought to the General Security building in Giza and from there to the Giza 
office of SSI.  "At this point I had been told noth ing about the reasons for my arrest 
-- they only asked my name," he told MEW.  He was p ut in a cell measuring 2x1.5 
meters and spent the next twenty-four hours without  food or a mattress and 
blankets.  "I could hear constant screams," he said .   
 
 At 7:00 p.m. on the second day, he was blindfolded  and his hands were 
tied behind his back.  He was beaten and slapped wi th hands and fists until 11 p.m. 
by about five different men, including someone he d escribed as "very strong."  He 
was asked only general questions, and was released the next day at four in the

afternoon, he told MEW.15 
 
 MEW interviewed Atif Jamil Mahmoud, nineteen years  old, from Minya, 
five days after his release from detention. He was arrested at his home at 3:00 a.m. 
on February 5, 1992, by a security force of twenty men who arrived in four vehicles. 
He was taken to the 
new SSI building in 
Minya and 
questioned there at 
4:00 a.m. while 
blindfolded. "They 
asked me about 
people and hiding 
places.  They asked about four questions and then l eft me alone," he said.  Then, 
from noon until 2:00 p.m., and again from 9:00 to 1 1:00 p.m., he was tortured with 
electric shock. "All I was wearing was my underwear ," he told MEW. "They asked 
questions, and then shocked every part of my body.  Ten seconds on my penis, and 
then up, and then it was repeated.  There were abou t four or five people in the 
room, but I think only one person was doing the tor ture.  He was near to me and I 
knew him from his voice -- I think it was Ali Anwar , an SSI officer. The second time, 
it was done exactly the same way.  Both times I was  handcuffed behind my back

 SSI interrogation sessions involving torture typic ally are designed to  Approximately 400 Islamist political detainees, so me of whom 
have been held without charges for over three years , were on hunger 
strike when MEW representatives visited Tora Istikb al prison on February 
16, 1992 (see Chapter Five for additional informati on).  MEW visited one of 
the two buildings where these detainees were being held.  During this 
brief visit,  detainees provided MEW with a seven-p age handwritten list 
that contained information, by name, of the type of  torture sustained and 
the scars that still remained from the physical abu se.  The list contained 
the names of 202 detainees.  Ages were listed for 1 46 of them: the 
youngest was sixteen years old, the oldest was fift y-two; the mean age 
was 23.8 years. 
 
 Of the 202 detainees, 127 (sixty-three percent) sa id that they had 
been exposed to torture. The most commonly reported  method was 
beating, cited by eighty-three detainees (sixty-fiv e percent of the total 
number tortured), fourteen of whom said that solid or sharp objects were 
used; four said that they were whipped.  The second  most common 
method was electric shock, reported by forty-eight detainees (thirty-
eight percent).  Eleven detainees (nine percent) re ported weight-bearing 
suspension. Burning the flesh was the least frequen tly reported abuse: 
three detainees were reported burned with cigarette s, and two said they 
were burned with hot water. 
 
 Of the 127 torture victims, twenty-nine (or twenty -three percent) 
said that marks of their torture still remained, su ch as ligament tears, 
fractures, scars, bruises or perforated ear drums.   
 
 A key demand of the hunger strikers at Tora Istikb al was a plea 
that prison authorities be required to record the p hysical signs of torture 
on detainees' bodies immediately upon their admissi on to a prison.       80 808080    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE

individuals.  Other inquiries are more general "fis hing expeditions."  In still other 
cases, discussed below, interrogators appeared inte nt on punishing or 
intimidating individuals because of their political  beliefs. In one case, a detainee 
was tortured in an attempt to recruit him as an inf ormer.

 In many cases SSI tortured detainees in its custod y to obtain highly 
specific information. An engineer in his thirties t old MEW of his torture at 
Lazoughly in December 1991 because his interrogator s wanted information about 
specific people.  Two seventeen-year-olds, one from  Assyut and the other from 
Minya, were both released from prison in February 1 992.  In separate interviews, 
on different days in different cities, they told ME W of interrogation sessions that 
included the use of electric shocks to elicit infor mation about the whereabouts of 
certain individuals.  
 
 A thirty-five-year-old accountant reported that he  was held for twenty-
one days at Lazoughly after his arrest in July 1991  and tortured to provide 
addresses that his SSI interrogators were seeking.  A fifty-year-old Cairo 
housewife, whom MEW met at random during a visit to  Qanater women's prison on 
February 15, 1992, said the purpose of her interrog ation and torture at Lazoughly 
was to obtain information about one man. A civil en gineer, twenty-nine years old, 
was arrested in October 1991 and tortured in the SS I building in Alexandria and at 
SSI's Lazoughly headquarters because his interrogat ors wanted to know if he 
knew certain individuals.  A sixteen-year-old stude nt from Alexandria was 
arrested in November 1988 and tortured during inter rogations aimed at obtaining 
his admission that he knew certain individuals.

 An engineer in his thirties told MEW of his arrest  in mid-December 1991.  
A large force came to his home at 1 a.m., broke dow n the door and entered his 
bedroom, armed.  "There was a fight, a struggle," h e said.  "They even struck my 
wife. They asked my name, then took off my clothes and used them to tie me up.  
They used a piece of clothing to tie my hands behin d my back.  They dragged me 
out of the house like a dog, with a belt that was f astened from behind."  He was 
brought to Lazoughly.  "There were four interrogato rs. They asked me about people 
I didn't know.  I said I don't know anything.  They  asked about specific names and 
addresses.  I told them that they have detectives, why come to me?"

  At the beginning they said that they didn't 
want to torture me, because I was educated, 
cultured.  I continued to say that I didn't know 
anything.  One of the interrogators brought 
me to another one and said: "Leave him, he 
doesn't know anything."  The first night I was 
kept sitting, with my hands tied behind my 
back. 
 
  The second day, they asked the same kinds of 
questions.  Names I didn't know, the jobs and 
addresses of people I didn't know.  The tone 
of the questioning changed.  They began to 
beat me with their fists for about one hour. 
 
  They took me to another person, whose words 
were violent, cruel:  "We can make you speak. 
 The law is in our hands.  We can keep you for 
three years," he told me. I continued to say 
that I didn't know anything.  They brought me 
to a cold shower and then put me on a 
mattress.  I was freezing.  Something was 
used to hold my body down, a tool that kept 
me from moving. Then they used electricity 
on me. 
 
  They started at my neck, then my pectorals 
and my nipples, then my most sensitive parts. 
 They told me that I wouldn't be able to have 
children.  Sometimes they would spend five 
to ten minutes on one spot, sometimes they 
would just scan the entire body for five to ten 
minutes.  I don't remember if the implement 
that they used was making a sound.   
 
 The engineer was held at Lazoughly for one week.  "Some days they left 
me completely alone, on some days they just threate ned me, saying they would 
detain me for three years, that I won't see my fami ly.  When I was tortured again, it 
was the same treatment, for between one and two hou rs."  He was brought from

 In late 1991, prior to his transfer to a prison, A hmad Thabet Muhammed, a 
seventeen-year-old high school graduate from Assyut , was held incommunicado 
first at the local SSI office in Assyut and then at  a Central Security Forces military 
camp outside the city.  He provided MEW with detail ed testimony about his torture 
during the period he was held incommunicado. He was  arrested in the street in 
Assyut on November 27, 1991.  He was released from prison on February 6, 1992 and 
interviewed by MEW four days later.    
  
 "I was on a motorcycle and had stopped to talk wit h someone.  I was 
circled by SSI forces in civilian clothes."  He was  taken to the SSI office in Assyut, 
where "they didn't talk to me at all."  He was blin dfolded in the reception area, led 
down a corridor and taken to a room.  "There were a bout four people in the room.  
My clothes were removed and from one to one-and-a-h alf hours they insulted me 
and doused me with water, followed by electricity."   (At this point in the interview 
he was obviously pained and was reluctant to talk a bout this experience in 
greater detail.)  
 
 He was given his clothes to put on and was brought  to the Central 
Security Forces military camp near Assyut.  He was blindfolded again when he was 
taken to the camp hospital.  "They stripped me of m y clothes, threw cold water on 
me and then used electricity right away."  His hand s were cuffed in front, his 
ankles tied, and he was suspended between two chair s from a pole that was 
placed under his legs.  "They beat the top part of my feet," he said, showing MEW 
representatives the scars that remained.   
 
  Then they let me down.  My legs were really 
swollen.  They told me to jump because it 
would make the swelling go down.  I couldn't 
jump.  They brought the electricity to make 
me jump.  I couldn't stand up at all.  They 
started to shock me, randomly, all over my 
body.  This lasted for two hours.

  Then they hanged me on a door, with my 
hands cuffed behind my back.  They kept 
moving the door open and closed.  This lasted 
about thirty minutes.  They took me down, left 
the room, and then came back and hanged 
me again in the same way, this time for about 
fifteen minutes.  My hands were tied with a 
piece of cloth and it broke.  I fell on my neck 
and left shoulder.  Someone said, "You're 
going to kill him."  About five minutes later, 
they hanged me again, using a strong rope.  
This lasted fifteen minutes, followed by more 
electricity on my sensitive areas while I was 
hanging. 
 
What did his torturers want from him?  "All they wa nted was one address, that of 
Dr. Ahmad Abu Sleim," he said quietly. 
 
 After this ordeal, he was moved to a small cell th at measured 2x1.5 
meters.  It had a high ceiling and a 50x50 cm windo w in the upper part of one wall. 
 The cell was devoid of furnishings. His blindfold was removed.  "I spent one week 
there.  The cell had no toilet.  They never let me out."    
 
 His still-swollen legs obviously caused concern to  his captors.  After one 
week in the cell, he was moved to a car.  "They let  me out of the car at 2:00 a.m. and 
the soldiers massaged my legs then returned me to t he car.  The next day a 
policeman brought hot oil and made the soldiers mas sage it into my legs.  On the 
third day, they brought doctors.  There were three doctors at the camp.  One doctor 
said there was no problem but another doctor decide d to work on my leg. They 
took me outside the car and the doctor used crude p rocedures to lance my leg and 
remove the pus." 
 
 He finally was moved to Tora Istikbal prison outsi de Cairo, where the 
authorities refused to receive him because of his p hysical condition.  He then was 
taken to what he said was called a "hospital" at To ra Liman prison and held in a 
cell measuring about 5x10 to 11 feet.  "There were four people in this cell, and no 
mattresses and no toilet," he said.18

 The use of Tora Liman prison to treat detainees wh o have suffered 
injuries from torture inflicted elsewhere was noted  by sentenced prisoners 
currently being held at Tora Liman.  MEW representa tives visited the prison on 
February 13, 1992 and were given handwritten docume nts by prisoners.  One of the 
documents included the following information: 
 
  We saw here at Tora Liman some cases 
transferred from prisons and camps of SSI in 
order to receive medical treatment, following 
several serious injuries which were inflicted 
upon them as a result of torture.19

Before his arrest, "my house was attacked several t imes because the security 
forces were looking for me,"  he told MEW.  He was handcuffed and blindfolded and 
brought to the SSI building in Minya. (He said that  he could see through his 
blindfold, which is how he knew where he was.)  "Th ey held me there from 
Wednesday to Friday."  On Friday night, he was take n to Bandar police station.  On 
Sunday at noon, he was taken out a back door of the  police station and brought to 
the new SSI building in Minya.  "I was blindfolded again, put in a room and then 
taken to the sixth floor." 
 
 There, he was stripped of his clothes and shocked with electricity from 1 
a.m. until 3 a.m.  "I was standing naked, wearing o nly my blindfold.  I was shocked 
with a light touch, then questioned.  This went on for two hours."  He said that the 
electric shocks were administered by someone he kne w personally: he 
recognized the voice of SSI officer Mukhtar Abdul W akil. What was the purpose of 
the interrogation?  "They wanted to know the addres ses of certain people," he told 
MEW.

head, back and legs."  Bound by the wrists and ankl es, he was suspended from a

with an "electric stick" all over his body.  "They wanted me to show them houses,

door.  Ten men came in and asked to see

were looking for Muhammed.  They searched

dressed.  There were two cars downstairs. 
They blindfolded me and didn't speak to me in 
the car. 
 
 She was brought to SSI headquarters at Lazoughly a nd taken to a fourth-
floor hallway, blindfolded with her hands cuffed be hind her back.  She was moved 
to a room for her interrogations, during which "the y kept asking about 
Muhammed."  She believed SSI wanted information abo ut a Muhammed from el-
Areesh in Sinai who had visited her house once with  a relative.  
 
 Mrs. el-Kurd was tortured for about a half-hour ev ery other day:  
 
  They insulted and cursed me, using bad 
words.  They called me a prostitute and made 
sexual threats. Then they started to hit me on 
my face.  One called me "daughter of a dog."  I 
was hit under the chin and my teeth began to 
bleed.  I could feel that my face was swollen.  
 
"They used electricity on the top of my hands, in f ast little jabs," she said, holding 
up her hands to show that the shocks left no scars.    
 
 For the ten days, she was held in the hallway, out side a cell where there 
were about ten male detainees, Islamists she believ ed, who kept "coming and 
going.  They gave me food.  A soldier would come to  take me to the men's 
bathroom.  I had no contact with water in ten days. "   
 
 Mrs. el-Kurd is a Palestinian who was born in the Gaza Strip; she has lived 
in Egypt for the past twenty-three years.  Her husb and, seventy years old, is in poor

from mosques and arrested." 
 
 Amgad's mother continues to be believe that her so n disappeared while 
he was in the custody of security forces. She bases  this conviction partly on 
information she received from a police general who befriended the family after 
Amgad's disappearance and told them that Amgad was taken to Cairo by security 
forces on January 12, 1989.  The police officer rep ortedly obtained this information 
from Rashad el-Sharqawi, the head of SSI in Alexand ria.  After the family received 
this tip, they confronted the SSI with the informat ion. "After that, the summonses 
started," Mrs. Shinawi told MEW, "and they wanted t o know who told us that our son 
was taken to Cairo." 
 
 The other incident that Amgad's mother cannot forg et -- and contributes 
to her belief that her son disappeared at the hands  of security forces -- occurred 
during a meeting with an SSI officer to discuss her  son's case.  The officer read 
information to her from Amgad's file, going over da tes, "and then suddenly he 
stopped, although I saw that there were more notati ons and dates in the file after 
the last date he mentioned."25

 In other cases investigated by MEW, SSI interrogat ors only asked 
questions of a general nature but victims endured t he rigors of full-fledged 
torture.26  Some of the victims interviewed by MEW were convi nced that the 
purpose of the interrogation and torture was less t o obtain information -- although 
that may have been a subsidiary goal -- than to pun ish or intimidate them for the 
political beliefs they were presumed to hold or esp ouse, or to discourage 
particular activities. This view is reinforced by t he fact that in such cases 
detainees are released without ever being charged w ith an offense.  Appendix C 
contains cases of this nature from 1989; other case s from 1991 follow.

     26According to the testimony of former detainees inte rviewed by MEW, in numerous cases 
both SSI interrogators and Ministry of Justice pros ecutors asked questions that were not of 
a specific nature, indicating that the arrest and d etention in such cases was arbitrary or not 
based on a well-founded suspicion of specific activ ities or actions in violation of the law.       90 909090    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE

 Hani Abd el-Magd Haneh Saim, a mathematics teacher , told MEW of his 
torture at the SSI building in Tanta, a city north of Cairo, in October 1991.  He was 
brought there from the SSI office in nearby Zifta, where he was not mistreated.  On 
the first day of his detention at Tanta, he was bro ught to the "investigation" room 
and held there from the afternoon until dawn, quest ioned about membership in 
the Muslim Brotherhood, his religious beliefs and h is opposition to the Madrid 
conference.  He was beaten, boxed about the face, a nd poked with a stick that 
caused immediate electric shock.  "They would beat me, then ask questions, then 
shock me, then ask questions, then box me.  They to ok turns.  I was forced to stand 
the entire time."  He said he received similar trea tment for the next three days.  On 
the fifth day, there was no interrogation and his b lindfold was removed.  He was 
allowed to go to the bathroom only once a day, esco rted by a soldier with a gun.   
 
 He told MEW that he had blue-black bruises on his shoulders from the 
beatings but that there were no marks from the elec tric shocks.  He was moved on 
the fifth day to Abu Za`bal prison and held there u ntil November 13, when he was 
taken to Benha, where he spent one night in the dis trict SSI office.  From there, he 
was taken to Tanta SSI and held for one night, and finally to Zifta SSI, where he also 
was held for one night.  He was released without ch arge on November 16, 1991.  He 
told MEW that he was never questioned by a prosecut or while he was in 
detention.27

 Medhat al-Sayyid Ahmad, twenty years old, was tort ured after his arrest 
on the afternoon of November 15, 1991 in Assyut.  M EW interviewed him on February 
10, 1992, the day after his release from prison, an d he provided the following 
account.   
 
 "I was in the mosque for the Friday morning prayer  and went home.  At 
about 1:15 p.m. I heard shots.  There were about te n policemen, twenty soldiers and 
ten men in plainclothes entering the house.  I clim bed up to the roof to escape and 
they shot live fire.  I was caught and they took me  to the criminal investigation 
building ( mabahith ginaiyya )."  There, he was blindfolded, his ankles cuffed a nd 
his hands cuffed behind his back.  Several of his c aptors threatened to kill him.

 He was put in a car and taken to the Central Secur ity Forces camp outside 
Assyut.  "Going into the building and up the stairs , they smashed me against the 
walls. They removed my clothes and for the next nin e days I wore only my 
underwear."  His blindfold was never removed. 
 
 On the first night, he was hanged over a door for short periods, doused 
with hot and cold water, and shocked with electrici ty.  "This was done throughout 
the night until the morning prayers."  For the next  three days, he was forced to 
stand constantly. Then he was hanged from the ceili ng by iron chains placed 
around his wrists.  His wrists occasionally were ma ssaged by his captors. "There 
was torture for the first seven days, for about fiv e hours each time, beginning after 
the morning prayer.  After three days, they let me sit, with my hands tied behind my 
back and my ankles cuffed together.  On the sixth d ay, they threatened to rape me." 
 What did his interrogators want?  "They focused on  one question only:  Who was 
with you?  They accused me of attacking a Copt who later died.  They asked only 
general questions -- they had no dates, no places."  
   
 He told MEW that he was given a tablet on the eigh th day, which "broke 
my exhaustion from the torture."  On the ninth day of his detention, he found 
himself in the Second Section Police Station of Ass yut when his blindfold was 
removed.  He then was presented to the niyaba.  He showed the niyaba his scars, 
and the niyaba brought him the next day to a local doctor affiliated with the 
Ministry of Health.  He was returned to the police station, despite the fact that the 
niyaba had "set him free" and he was released by a judge, "and SSI took me to Tora 
Istikbal. I was released yesterday," al-Sayyid told  MEW.28  (See Chapter Two for 
information about attempts by al-Sayyid's lawyers t o complain to the authorities 
about his incommunicado detention.)

-- some in civilian clothes, some in uniforms -- an d broke down the door.  There 
were three vehicles outside.  He was taken to the n ew SSI building near the

removed his blindfold.   
 
 Just before dawn, he was stripped of all his cloth es and attached to a 
chair, his hands bound behind his back, his ankles tied.  "They started to question 
me, to question me about things I didn't know.  Whe n I said that I didn't know, they 
started with electric shocks in every sensitive spo t, my ears, my tongue."  He said 
that the electricity was applied in rapid strokes, with what seemed like an 
"electric stick."   
 
 "This lasted about a half-hour, and then they took  me back to the 
detention area."  He remained in the detention area  for two days and was asked no 
more questions.  Then he was taken upstairs again, this time not blindfolded.  
"[Officer] Mukhtar Abdul Wakil told me not to have contact with Islamic groups.  At 
midnight, he told me to go home."29

 Khalid Sayyid Mahmoud, a young worker from Assyut,  told MEW that he 
was tortured because his interrogators wanted infor mation. Before his release, he 
was also advised to discontinue working at the rest aurant where he was 
employed.   
 
 He was arrested in Assyut on November 16, 1991.  A fter a half-hour each at 
the Assyut police station and the SSI building, he was brought to the CSF camp 
outside Assyut with 15 others who had been arrested  that day. He was first placed 
in a single cell, at about 11 p.m., then he was tak en to the two-story hospital30 at the 
camp:   
 
  Our whole group was tortured from eleven at 
night until five in the morning. They called us 
two at a time.  I heard the screams of the 
others.  They stayed about forty-five minutes 
with each one.  They called my name last. On 
the stairs to the second floor there's a 
reception.  I was beaten on the face and the

back.  "We've been waiting for you for a long 
time .. you'll never go out,"  they said. I was not  
blindfolded until I was going up the stairs. 
 
Once he was in a room on the second floor of the ho spital, someone ordered that 
all his clothes be removed.  His hands were cuffed behind his back. Khalid, who 
has a full auburn beard, described what happened ne xt:  
 
  They pulled me from my beard and said, 
"Patience, family of Yasser, you will enter 
heaven."  Four were doing the questioning.  
They asked me about names and said: "Are 
you going to talk?"  They poured hot then cold 
water on me and put electricity on my head.  
They did this about five times.  The water 
covered my ankles.  I fell in the water and 
jumped hysterically about ten times.  They 
repeated the questions.   
 
 On his last jump, he fell and his left shoulder wa s injured.  "They 
continued the torture.  They hit me with electric s ticks in sensitive parts of my 
body and threatened me sexually.  They warned me no  longer to go to the 
restaurant where I worked. After a half-hour, they put all my clothes in the water.  I 
couldn't put my clothes on because of the pain.  Th ey removed my blindfold after I 
left the hospital." 
 
 He was brought again to a single cell.  "I told a soldier that my arm was 
broken and I needed a hospital, and he said: `We ha ve no hospital here.'  I stayed 
in this cell until four in the afternoon the next d ay.  Then they called three names.  I 
was blindfolded and the same person questioned me a nd told me that he didn't 
want to see me again in the restaurant."  Khalid wa s then returned to the police 
station in Assyut, where Ahmad Mustafa, the policem an in the station, asked him 
what had happened to him.  
 
 Khalid told MEW that his shoulder was in a cast fo r six weeks and 
demonstrated to MEW representatives that he still w as unable to move his left arm 
normally. 
 
 Lawyers submitted a complaint to the niyaba about Khalid's torture on 
November 25, 1991. "We arrived at 2:00 p.m. and the  niyaba wanted to leave     94 949494    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE     
 
because his workday ended at 2:00 p.m.," one lawyer  told MEW.  "He screamed at 
Khalid in our presence.  He saw that Khalid couldn' t move his arm, but said there 
was no beating, no nothing.  Khalid named Ashraf Ta ha, an SSI soldier, as one of his 
torturers. The niyaba spent about a half hour with us and asked some questions.  
We left a written complaint. There has been no deci sion, the case is still 
pending."31 
 
Torture To Obtain ConfessionsTorture To Obtain ConfessionsTorture To Obtain ConfessionsTorture To Obtain Confessions 
 
 Torture is also used by SSI officers to obtain con fessions from political 
and security suspects.  Egyptian courts have played  a positive role in affirming 
that this practice occurs.  Judges have acquitted d efendants when it could be 
shown that confessions had been coerced under tortu re, as discussed in Chapter 
Four.  Three cases of torture at Lazoughly, for the  purposes of obtaining 
confessions, are discussed below.

 On March 2, 1991, several days after the Gulf War ceasefire, Muhammed 
Afifi Mattar, a prominent Egyptian poet who then wa s fifty-five years old, was 
arrested.  "It was known that he was opposed to the  Gulf War, but he talked only in 
coffee shops about his opinions, not in public gath erings,"  Sayyid Abu Zeid, 
Mattar's lawyer, told MEW.  Abu Zeid said that the poet was in the Zaharet el-Bostan 
coffee shop in downtown Cairo, a gathering place fo r "artistic types.  While sitting 
at the cafe, he declared his affection and sympathy  for Iraq.  The next day he was 
arrested.  They accused him of working for the Ba`a thists, of being part of an 
organized group."   
 
 After a brief stay at a police station, he was tak en to SSI headquarters at 
Lazoughly and tortured, reportedly to force him to confess that he had links to a 
pro-Iraq Ba`athist organization.  After his release , Mattar issued a statement 
describing his torture.  He was hanged for long per iods by his cuffed hands, with 
his feet bound, and his wrists forced to carry his body's weight.  He was beaten 
with sticks and other implements, shocked with elec tricity, and forced to stand in 
front of "severely cold air currents" for long inte rvals.32

 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture received in formation from the 
government on October 24, 1991 about Mattar's case.  The Government informed 
the Special Rapporteur "that a warrant of arrest ha d been issued on 20 March 1991 
for his involvement in clandestine opposition activ ities for the benefit of a foreign 
State."33  The Egyptian authorities further told the Special  Rapporteur that Mattar 
"admitted the charges ... [but also] expressed awar eness of the need for his 
national and ideological rehabilitation and it was therefore decided to release 
him on 9 May 1991."34  The government added that Mattar and those who vi sited 
him in prison did not submit any complaints to the judicial authorities about the 
poet's torture or mistreatment.  Mattar's attorney provided information to MEW 
which directly contradicts the Egyptian authorities ' version of developments in 
this case.35  As discussed in detail in Chapter Four, the lawye r said that he 
personally complained to the prosecutor general abo ut his client's torture and, 
one week after Mattar was released, he accompanied the poet to the Prosecutor 
General's office, where Mattar handed the Prosecuto r General a written complaint.

 He provided MEW with a copy of his forensic medica l report. He was 
examined on November 17, 1990 by a forensic patholo gist from the Ministry of 
Justice, pursuant to a memorandum written by the ni yaba investigating his case, 
who saw injuries on Farouk's feet, leg, back, chest  and nose.  In a report dated 
January 9, 1992, Dr. Aatef Mahmoud Sayyid described  the existence and size of 
blue bruises on the upper and middle back, the neck  and chest; a healing scab on 
the nose and a completely healed scab on the right wrist; and scabs in formation 
on the left arm and left leg.  The doctor concluded  that some of the injuries 
"resulted from collision with a hard object or obje cts" consistent with the victim's 
testimony to the niyaba, but was "unable technicall y to definitively establish the 
cause of the injuries or the implement used."37

 A resident of the Ain Shams district of Cairo had been sought by security 
forces for four months prior to his arrest in June 1991. "They arrested my brother 
and held him for four days, to force me to turn mys elf in," he told MEW.  "One day in 
June, I was at prayers at the mosque and fainted fo r no reason.  Friends took me 
home.  I felt sick and went to sleep.  I woke up at  about 2 am and found myself 
surrounded by security forces with guns pointed at me.  They asked my name and 
told me to come with them.  I asked if I could wash  my face.  From the bathroom 
window, I saw that the entire street was filled wit h police." 
 
 He was brought downstairs and handcuffed behind hi s back.  "I could 
hear the apartment being ransacked," he said.  "The y put me in a car, but at the 
beginning of the street they forced me out of the c ar and asked  who lived on the 
street with me.  I gave them the name of a known dr ug trafficker.  They wanted me 
to show them the house.  They searched his house an d found drugs, but an officer 
punched me in the face and said I lied. (The securi ty forces presumably were 
seeking the names of Islamist activists who lived o n the street, not drug dealers.) 
 
 He was put back in the car and at one point was fo rced to get out, thrown 
on the ground and beaten with gun butts.  He said t hat he pretended to faint. He 
then was put in another vehicle which contained thr ee people he knew. They were 
brought together to Lazoughly and separated.  He wa s taken to an upstairs room, 
where his feet were bound and his hands cuffed behi nd his back.

  They hanged me over the top of a door.  I 
couldn't resist for even one moment.  The 
weight of my entire body was on my back and 
shoulders.  The pain was awful and I fainted.  
Then they threw water on me and forced me 
to stand up.  They tied me to something iron 
and used electricity on me.  From underneath 
my blindfold, I saw an electric appliance that 
looked like a small pistol, black, with an 
adjustment button. 
 
  First they shocked me on my neck, then my 
chest, then they went lower.  They had to hold 
me up.  "You're accused of trying to kill 
Muhammed Awad [the commander of Tora 
Istikbal prison].  Talk."  They pulled out a 
piece of my beard under my chin.  They hit me 
in my face.  "The niyaba will force you to 
confess to everything I'm talking about, one 
of them told me.  Talk or we'll put you on the 
door again."  I agreed to confess.   
 
At this point, the beating stopped and his clothes were put on.   
 
 "The next day, they told me that if I said anythin g to the niyaba except 
what they told me, they would kill me," he said.  H e was brought from Lazoughly to 
the al-Maza police station in Heliopolis, still bli ndfolded. "The man accused in the 
case is here,"  a voice said.  His blindfold was re moved.  "I saw a man, nicely 
dressed in a suit. He told me that he worked for th e niyaba.  I was nervous and 
dropped the glass of lemon juice they had given me.   The man was comforting, and 
told me to tell him everything that happened to me since I was taken from the 
house.  I denied ever seeing Muhammed Awad or tryin g to kill him."    
 
 In the same police station, he saw the wife of a f riend suspended over a 
door.  "If you don't say what we want tomorrow," he  said he was told, "we'll hang 
your mother and sister like this."   The next day h e was brought to the niyaba.  "I 
asked to see the niyaba's identification card.  He asked me questions. He said that 
I should be released.  I told the niyaba that any c onfession after this time would be 
coerced under torture.  I also told him what they d id to me."     98 989898    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE     
 
 
 He was brought back to Lazoughly and held there fo r eight days.  "I was 
tortured again just for the sake of it," he told ME W.  Then he was informed that he 
would be transferred to Tora Istikbal prison. "Befo re they brought me to Tora, I was 
taken to a hospital because I was completely gone p hysically.  I was given oxygen 
and fed intravenously."  He spend eight days in a h ospital, under guard, before he

 As noted in Chapter One, Egyptian security forces maintain a network of 
informers throughout the country.  Egyptian human r ights monitors told MEW that 
teachers, students and others are recruited as SSI informers.39  In some cases, SSI 
officers attempt to recruit individuals while they are held incommunicado in SSI 
custody, as the following account indicates.

  They said not a word to me until two in the

back like a baby coming out of my mother's 
womb.'  They stripped me naked and cuffed 
my hands behind my back.  `Work for us,' they 
said.  I refused again.  Then they electric 
shocked me, starting at my nipples and then 
down to my penis.  I had no sense of time and 
I think I fainted for what seemed like a long 
time.  
  I continued to refuse to work with them. They 
tied my feet and hanged me upside down. 
Then they uncuffed me, tied my hands in the 
front, and put a stick in my anus.  I moved my 
hands up, pulled off my blindfold, and spit in 
their faces.   
 
He told MEW that one of them hit him in the face wi th a gun butt, knocking out his 
two front teeth.  (The teeth had not been replaced at the time of MEW's interview.)  
What did he see after he removed his blindfold?  "A  desk in a wood-panelled room. 
One of the men had blond hair and a white round fac e.  He looked over forty."  His 
torture continued.  His captors pulled at his beard  and, still naked, he was placed 
under "freezing cold water.  I felt an electric bur n as the water fell.  I fainted.  I 
woke up to them urinating on me." 
 
 He was forced to stand for an entire day.  "I was hit with a whip if I sat 
down.  Then they took me for another investigation.   `Will you work with us or not?' 
they said.  They tied me up, handcuffed me behind m y back and hanged me from 
the ceiling.  They used whips or something to beat the soles of my feet.  When I 
started to scream, they put a stick in my mouth.  T hey used electricity again, 
especially on a wound at the top of my head." 
 
 He spent a total of eighteen days at Lazoughly, an d "every now and then 
they would use the torture."  He then was moved to Tora Istikbal prison, where he 
spent forty-five days before being brought before a  judge, who ordered his 
release.42 
                                                                    
     42The Ministry of Interior opposed his release.  He t hen was ordered released by a second 
court but, he told MEW, "I was brought back to pris on and then taken to an unknown location 
for ten days.  On the eleventh day, I was tied up a nd beaten with whips. `The courts will be no 
use,' they told me.  `Even if you're ordered releas ed a hundred times, we won't let you go.'      100 100100100    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE

 In addition to the problem of incommunicado detent ion by SSI prior to 
transfer to a prison, a parallel problem exists wit h regard to movement of 
detainees from prisons into temporary SSI custody, reportedly without 
documenting such movements in prison log-books.  Th e movement of detainees 
out of prisons appears to be done for two reasons: for interrogation by SSI -- 
sometimes accompanied by torture -- in incommunicad o detention, and to 
facilitate continuous long-term detention of politi cal prisoners ordered released 
from detention by a court.   The latter purpose, wh ich allows the authorities to 
claim that detainees have been released pursuant to  court orders when in fact 
they simply are removed from prison and held in SSI  custody until a new detention 
order can be written, is discussed in detail in Cha pter Five. 
 
  Lawyers, human rights monitors and detainees them selves charge that 
such movements are not noted in the prisons' log bo oks. EOHR reported that the 
practice is used particularly with detainees suspec ted of affiliation with Islamist 
groups: 
 
  [I]n a number of cases, particularly regarding 
those whom the authorities suspect of having 
links with Islamic groups, torture may take 
place even following transfer to prison.  The 
detainee is taken in the middle of the night to 
the SSI headquarters in Lazoughly and is 
returned to the prison before dawn.  In 
special case the detainee may undergo 
torture during successive nights.  Testimony 
received by EOHR indicates that Tora 
[Istikbal] Prison plays a key role in this kind 
of operation.  Detainees are removed from 
there, on a daily basis, to be tortured in 
Lazoughly and then returned back to prison, 
without detainees' movements being 
                                                                                                                                                                          
After eleven days, I was brought back to Tora priso n, as if I was just arrested, as if I'd been 
free for the eleven days."  He was finally released  almost a year later. See  Chapter Five for

 The practice of omitting information from prison l og-books that would 
document the access of SSI officers to prisoners is  not new. A former Ministry of 
Interior inspector, Gen. Samir Abed al-Rahman `Eid,  who is also a lawyer, 
complained about the practice in the 1980s.  In Jan uary 1985, Gen. `Eid, wrote a 
letter to the deputy prosecutor general about the e ntry of SSI officers into prisons 
for the purpose of torturing detainees.   
 
 Gen. `Eid charged that former Interior Minister Ge n. Hassan Abu Basha, 
when he was the head of SSI, "allowed SSI officers to enter prisons [where 
political prisoners were being held] in order to un dertake torture, without 
registering their names in the [prison] gates' book s as the instructions stipulate, 
so these officers could escape punishment and to pr event those who were 
tortured from establishing accusations against spec ific persons."44    
 
 Gen. `Eid added in his letter that the then-direct or of the Prisons 
Administration, Gen. Mohsen Talat, had complained a bout the unrecorded 
entrance of SSI officers into prisons but had been overruled by Abu Basha.  When 
Abu Basha was appointed Interior Minister, "he dism issed Gen. Mohsen 
Talat...despite his qualifications, because of his opposition to the entrance of SSI 
to prisons without documenting their names," Gen. ` Eid asserted.  According to 
Gen. `Eid, Gen. Talat was replaced by Gen. Fouad Fa reed, the director of SSI's Cairo 
branch and "a friend" of the Minister of Interior. 
 
 Gen. `Eid personally had heard the sounds of tortu re at Tora Liman prison 
in 1982, but had been unable to gain access to the detainees and was thwarted in 
his efforts to report the abuse: 
 
  On February 13, 1982, during our nightly 
inspection of Liman Tora, there was torture 
inside the prison and we heard the voices 
and moans of torture from these political

prisoners.  The guard at the gate of Liman 
Tora refused to open the prison....The guard 
said that the key of the gate was not in the box 
with him, in violation of regulations.  We 
established that in the inspection report of 
that day, but Gen. Fouad Fareed, the friend of 
the Interior Minister and the director of the 
Prisons Administration, ordered that the 
report should be concealed, fearing the 
discovery of torture which he was 
supervising, as instructed by Abu Basha.45 
 
Gen. `Eid then went to Minister Abu Basha to report  what he had witnessed.  He 
wrote in his letter of complaint that the Minister had told him to "cut it out" and, 
instead of taking his report seriously, accused him  of being a communist.46

 Khalid Muhammed Ahmad Omar, a twenty-nine-year-old  civil engineer 
from Alexandria who was arrested on October 25, 199 1, told MEW that he was 
removed from prison and brought to Lazoughly. On th e third day of his detention, 
he was brought to Abu Za`bal prison from the police  station in Alexandria where he 
had been held.  On October 31, he was brought befor e a prosecutor who questioned 
him about his role in the distribution of political  leaflets.  "What had been 
removed from my apartment when they came to arrest me had nothing to do with 
this charge," he said, "so the niyaba released me."   Omar nevertheless was 
returned to Abu Za`bal and on November 14 was moved  to Tora Istikbal prison.  
 
 That night, he was blindfolded in his cell and pla ced in a vehicle with a 
blanket on top of 
his body. He was 
brought to SSI 
headquarters at 
Lazoughly and held 
there for seven 
days.  "I was 
handcuffed and 
blindfolded the 
entire time, even 
when I went to the toilet.  I was in a room on the fourth floor, close to the officers' 
offices.  On the second day, I was brought to the o fficers' room.  They asked if I 
knew people they named, the same questions they had  asked me in the SSI 
building in Alexandria after my arrest." (See above  for his account.) 
 
 They began to hit him randomly about the body, the n removed his clothes 
and continued hitting him.  "Then they used electri city, on my nipples and sexual 
region.  They did this from about noon until 2:30 i n the afternoon," he said.  He then 
was tied by his cuffed hands to the metal bars of a  window, with his feet touching 
the ground.  He estimated that he stood this way fo r about five hours, beginning at 
3:00 p.m. "This was accompanied by continuous insul ts, threats and curses." 
 
 This was the only time he was tortured at Lazoughl y.  He dismissed what 
had happened to him this way: "These are sick peopl e, just passing their time."  On 
his seventh day at Lazoughly he was returned to Tor a Istikbal prison in the same 
way he had been transported from the prison. He tol d MEW that while he was in 
Lazoughly his lawyer, Sayyid Hassan Mughzally, had filed a complaint with the 
niyaba because he could not locate his client in To ra prison.  "The niyaba visited 
me after I had been returned to Tora," he said.  "They asked if I knew people they named....Then the y 
used electricity, on my nipples and sexual region.  
They did this from about noon until 2:30 in the 
afternoon."       104 104104104    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE

 In April 1989, Mahmoud Yousef Ibrahim el-Zayyat, a  computer engineer 
who is now thirty-one years old, was arrested as he  was on his way to give a 
lecture at a mosque in Mansoura.  "I gave lectures three times a week," he told 
MEW.  Several men dressed in civilian clothes block ed the way in front of him and 
behind him.  "They handcuffed me and put me in a bi g Central Security Forces van.  
Soldiers with sticks were at the entrance to the va n. Another person from the 
mosque, who is nearly blind, was already in the van ."   
 
 They were taken to the Mansoura police station, wh ere el-Zayyat was 
held for two days. "The floor of the cell was very dirty and there was no mattresses 
or blankets.  No one knew where I was until the sec ond day.  My family finally 
heard from people on the street and they sent food.   It was the only food I ate."  He 
was photographed, finger-printed, foot-printed and had his voice print recorded.  
"On the third day, I was taken to Tora Istikbal pri son.  To this point, there was not 
one word of explanation about why I was arrested." 
 
 He was held for two weeks in solitary confinement in a small cell on the 
ground floor of the prison and subjected to periodi c beatings by guards.  One night 
at 10:00 p.m., he was summoned from his cell and to ld that the chief security 
officer wanted to see him.  He was put in a complet ely dark room, handcuffed and 
blindfolded, and then taken with a group of others into a vehicle and pushed down 
on the floor. He believes that he was taken to Lazo ughly because he could hear the 
nearby metro.  At the building, he was moved around , slapped, and then put in an 
elevator and taken into a third or fourth floor hal lway.

 He told MEW that, one by one, they were moved from  this "waiting room" 
to the investigation room.  He was brought there si x or seven times.  Before he 
entered the room, his handcuffs were moved from the  front to the back. 
 
  Once I was inside the room, I was beaten very 
violently from all sides with hands, feet, even 
shoulders.  I was beaten until I thought I 
would vomit, or die.  One officer said: "If you 
want to die, die.  No one knows you're here.  
You won't be the first one to die here.  If you 
die here we'll put you on the fence, shoot you 
and say that you were trying to escape." 
 
He was placed on the floor face down, with his arms  held forward above his head, 
and someone stood on his back.  Someone else pulled  at his beard.   
 
  Sometimes, there would be a very quick 
change.  They would put me in a chair and 
offer me tea.  They would question me about 
people and addresses.  They wanted to know 
the name of the leader of the Jihad 
Organization in Mansoura.  They asked about 
the structure of the group.  The wanted the 
addresses of people who had escaped. 
 
  On the sixth day, I was completely exhausted. 
I gave them a completely false address and 
there was a total change.  I was removed from "I was brought into a room and was seated. I felt a  wall behind me.  There 
were others with me.  We were beaten if we moved to  rest our backs 
against the wall.  We were told to lie down, then t o sit, then to stand.  We 
were beaten if we changed our position.  This conti nued for six days.  If 
we fell asleep, we were awakened and told to resume  our position. I 
heard continuous screaming, day and night.  It's po ssible that these 
screams were on a tape."      106 106106106    $$ $$    II IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTUREORTUREORTUREORTURE     
 
the investigation room and given sandwiches 
and tea.  They were very solicitous, but my 
blindfold and handcuffs remained on. 
 
 He was taken back to Tora prison, where he was hel d again in a solitary 
cell.  "Then they found out that the address I gave  them was wrong.  I was brought 
back to Lazoughly.  I was beaten immediately.  I wa s pulled by my beard and 
thrown on the floor.  One officer said that I would  pay with my life for giving a false 
address.  "It was two days of continuous beating," he told MEW.  "They asked me no 
questions."  He then was returned to Tora prison. 
 
 "After two months, an SSI officer came and told me  that I was being 
released.  He asked politely about names and addres ses and then left.  I was 
released one month later."48  After his release, he experienced continuing 
harassment from SSI.49

assistant researcher in the engineering faculty at Mansoura University.  Her scholarship 
was cancelled in September 1991 and she was removed  from her position as a researcher.

surrounding the breast...burns in his hands and leg s..stiffness in his hands."  EOHR 
reported that in early September a niyaba from the el-Maadi prosecution office 
visited the prison, saw signs of torture on el-Sher if's body, and ordered that he be 
transferred to a doctor's office for a forensic med ical examination.50  EOHR noted, 
however, that the prison authorities delayed implem entation of the prosecutor's 
orders. EOHR appealed to the Prosecutor General to initiate a "criminal case 
against the governor of Tora Reception Prison as we ll as the director of State 
Security Investigation department at Lazoughly in w hich torture was 
administered."51   
 
 Khaled el-Sherif was released without charge on Se ptember 27, 1990.  
According to EOHR, el-Sherif was questioned by the niyaba in November 1990 
about his torture.  The niyaba also took testimony from Muntasser el-Zayat, his 
lawyer, who witnessed the signs of torture on his c lient's body, and questioned the 
commander of Tora Istikbal prison. El-Sherif did no t receive a forensic medical 
examination until December 1990; according to EOHR,  the forensic medical report 
recorded the presence of evidence of torture. EOHR told MEW that "available 
information indicates that the cases has been filed  away, which is also the belief 
of Khaled el-Sherif."  
   
 The UN Special Rapporteur reported that the Minist ry of Interior sent a 
letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating t hat Sherif was arrested "on the 
basis of information concerning his involvement wit h members of the extremist 
Jihad organization, who had been indicted."  The go vernment said that Sherif was 
released on September 27, 1990 pursuant to a decisi on of the niyaba.  But the 
Special Rapporteur noted that the Interior Ministry 's letter provided "no details" 
about "the detailed torture allegations" included i n the Special Rapporteur's letter 
about this and three other cases sent to the Egypti an government on November 27,

 Dr. Ayman Ibrahim Taha was arrested on October 25,  1991, and taken to 
Tora Istikbal prison.  He told MEW that on the 20th  day of his detention he was 
covered with a blanket, handcuffed and blindfolded,  and put in a vehicle.  He was 
taken to SSI headquarters at Lazoughly and held the re for six days. When he 
arrived at Lazoughly, he walked up thirty-five step s and then was put in an elevator. 
 "They quickly asked me my name.  I told them and t hey said `You're number three.' 
 They never used my name again." 
 
 He was taken for nine interrogation sessions durin g the six days, each 
one lasting from three to five hours, generally fro m 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m., or from 9:00 
p.m. to 2:00 a.m.  The interrogations were conducte d by SSI officers. He described 
the space where the interrogations took place:  "Th ere were two rooms, one with 
the investigating officers. Each person would be in terrogated by three different 
officers. If you were unresponsive, you were taken to another room, the torture 
room.  
 
 "During interrogation I wore only my undershorts. I was handcuffed all 
the time, with my hands behind my back."  He rememb ered the handcuffs being 
very tight.  He was questioned about membership in the Muslim Brotherhood.  "I 
was beaten, slapped on the face, and kicked.  They used continuous insults about 
my mother, my father and my sister. They threatened  to rape my sister.  This is all 
they did to me."  He said that he was unable to hea r from one ear for ten days 
following his release. 
 
 He told MEW that there were four other detainees i n the "torture room" 
with him. In addition to the SSI officers, there we re always three SSI soldiers.  The 
room felt about 4x4 m in size and he said that it w as obvious that rape and electric 
shock were being used on the other detainees.  "I w as very close to one of them, 
about one meter away.  On three separate occasions I heard electricity being 
used, it seemed for about five to ten seconds and t hen removed.  Once it was done 
in the investigation room.  I heard the officers gi ving instructions to the soldiers, 
such as `Hang him!'"  He told MEW that once, on a T uesday at about 2:00 a.m., he 
and the other four detainees were in the "torture r oom" and one of the men was 
raped.  "It only happened once.  There were two mukhbireen  and it seemed one 
held him and one raped him.  One mukhbir  said he'd bring a zinghy  [a pejorative 
Arabic term for a black man] to come and rape him.  I heard the screaming for a 
half-hour."  He told MEW that he believes that "the  officers do the questioning and     I I IINTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND NTERROGATION AND TT TTORTURE ORTURE ORTURE ORTURE $$ $$    109109109109

 In an August 1991 report, EOHR termed the removal of detainees from 
prisons to SSI headquarters as "possibly the most s erious of all abuses" 
committed in the Tora prison complex.54  The failure to record the removal of 
prisoners into temporary SSI custody only complicat es the investigation and 
assignment of responsibility in case of a disappear ance.  EOHR notes the case of 
Mustapha Abdel Hamid Othman, a third-year medical s tudent at Zaqaziq University, 
who was arrested on December 17, 1989 and accused o f involvement in the 
attempted assassination, the day before, of then-In terior Minister Zaki Badr.  
Othman, who was held at Tora prison, was removed to  Lazoughly and never seen 
again: 
 
  He was held with other suspects in the case 
in Tora Istikbal prison, from which they were 
removed to Lazoughly for torture, and later 
returned back to prison but without Mustafa 
Abdel Hamid.  Eyewitnesses in Lazoughly say 
that they [saw] Mustafa in a state of extreme 
fatigue as a result of the torture.  Since that 
time, EOHR and Mustafa's family have been 
unable to determine his fate.55

 The persistent reports about the use of torture by  SSI are a sensitive 
subject for the Egyptian government. In January 199 2, the Egyptian Cabinet 
discussed the subject of torture but, unfortunately , the thrust was on public 
relations.  The Cabinet charged a special committee , composed of the Ministers of 
Interior, Justice, Information and Foreign Affairs,  to study ways to respond to 
allegations.  It was not charged with eradicating t orture.  In ominous statements 
designed to have a chilling effect on human rights monitoring in Egypt, 
government officials have argued that allegations o f torture are made for the 
purpose of "striking a blow against stability and d istorting the system of 
government" and "distorting Egypt's reputation amon g international 
organizations." 
 
 The Interior Minister continues to deny unequivoca lly that torture takes 
place, despite court decisions, forensic medical re ports by Ministry of Justice 
physicians, numerous written complaints submitted b y lawyers to state 
prosecutors, frequent reports by the Egyptian Organ ization for Human Rights and 
Amnesty International, and abundant testimony from torture victims themselves.  
The U.S. State Department also weighed in strongly on the subject in its 1992 
country report on Egypt: "Although torture is illeg al under Egyptian law, there is 
convincing evidence that it is practiced by police and security officers.  Those 
guilty of torture are seldom punished." 
 
 The lack of prosecution of SSI officers and soldie rs for torture "is a 
problem of enforcement," one prominent Egyptian law yer told MEW. "Egyptian law 
criminalizes torture. The issue is not the absence of laws, but the lack of will to 
enforce the laws." Article 57 of the Egyptian Const itution requires criminalization 
of "any assault on individual freedom."  Article 12 6 of the Penal Code states: "Every 
public servant or employee who subjects or orders t he subjection of an accused     116 116116116    $$ $$    GG GGOVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT II IINVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONS     
 
person to torture to obtain a confession shall be p unished by temporary hard 
labor or by imprisonment for a term of not less tha n three years nor more than ten 
years."  Torture also is proscribed by two internat ional human-rights instruments 
to which Egypt is a party: the International Covena nt on Civil and Political Rights, 
and the Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Egypt's Prosecut or General, Chancellor Raga' 
el-Araby, told MEW that torture constitutes a crime  with no statute of limitations 
under Egyptian law. 
 
 MEW found little interest on the part of Egyptian government officials to 
do more than deny the existence of torture, cite th e laws that prohibit this 
practice, and describe how the investigation proces s should work.  The 
Prosecutor General went as far as to deny having re ceived the repeated 
complaints about torture filed by Egypt's most prom inent and active human rights 
organization.  Ministry of Justice prosecutors ofte n demonstrate little interest in 
working actively with torture victims or their lawy ers, let alone in acting on 
complaints in a timely manner or to pursue investig ations thoroughly.

 In February 1992, Gen. Moussa, Egypt's Interior Mi nister, told MEW that 
allegations of torture are "absolutely contrary to the truth."1  His denial echoed 
comments made by Interior Ministry spokesmen under his predecessor, Gen. Zaki 
Badr, over two years earlier.  In May 1989, after A mnesty International issued a 
major report on torture in Egypt, the Interior Mini stry's response was adamant. 
"There is absolutely no truth in the report," a spo kesman for the Interior Ministry 
said.  "Torture of any kind does not happen in Egyp t."2  The New York Times  
reported that an Interior Ministry official, who de clined to be identified by name, 
said in reply to the report: "There is no torture o f any kind in Egyptian prisons.  Up

until now, no case of alleged torture has been prov ed."3         
    
 Egypt's Prosecutor General, Chancellor Raga' el-Ar aby, was barely less 
categorical in denying the existence of torture. He  said in an interview with MEW 
in February 1992 that Egypt is a country with a pop ulation of fifty-five million, and 
that there have been human rights reports of tortur e for "about three or four 
cases.  Even if these reports are true, these are i solated cases."  He stressed 
repeatedly that if a limited number of torture case s are discovered, this does not 
represent government policy. "The state does not en courage or routinely practice 
this abuse. If we find isolated cases, then it cann ot be said that this is encouraged 
by the state, [or] a continuous policy," the Prosec utor General said.4   
 
 To buttress their denials of torture by SSI, Egypt ian government officials 
whom MEW interviewed in February 1992 repeatedly ci ted the protracted trial, 
from 1986 to 1988, of some forty SSI officers accus ed of torture. However, the court 
did find evidence of torture by SSI as an instituti on, but simply was unable to 
assign responsibility to the particular forty SSI o fficers who were the defendants.  
As a study of Egypt published by the U.S. governmen t described the case: 
 
  The [General Directorate for State Security 
Investigation] was accused of torturing 
Islamic extremists to extract confessions.  In 
1986 forty GDSSI officers went on trial for 422 
charges of torture that were brought by Al 
Jihad defendants.  After lengthy legal 
wrangling, the court absolved all the GDSSI 
officers in mid-1988.  The judgment 
concluded that the GDSSI had indeed tortured 
Al Jihad members but said there was 
insufficient evidence to link the particular 
GDSSI officers on trial with the torture.5

 Officials' repeated references to the exculpation of SSI officers in the al-
Jihad case stand in sharp contrast to their silence  about the findings of Egyptian 
courts in other cases involving torture.  Given the  many courts that have found 
defendants' confessions coerced by torture, Egyptia n lawyers and rights monitors 
charge that the Prosecutor General has been remiss in carrying out his duty under 
Egyptian law to investigate allegations of torture,  search for evidence, and initiate 
criminal proceedings.  Lawyers stress that these co urt decisions -- coupled with 
allegations of torture that appear on a regular bas is in Egyptian newspapers, and 
written complaints by human-rights groups and attor neys -- are more than 
sufficient grounds for the Prosecutor General to co mmence a wide-ranging 
investigation of torture by SSI.

days.  Others were rounded up on suspicion of invol vement in the same events and 
were also tortured.10 
 
 "An investigation found that they were tortured, a ll of them," the lawyer 
said.  "The court decided that the accused in this case were arrested and detained 
for long periods before being seen by the niyaba an d that during this period they 
were subjected to aggression and some torture.  Thi s included slaps on the face, 
kicks, whippings and electric shocks, to force them  to confess or to say certain 
things.  This was proved by the niyaba by looking a t visible wounds, bruises and 
other marks.  Also, medical reports proved that som e of the accused had wounds 
from whipping and traces of electric shocks."  The court threw out the confessions 
of the defendants as coerced and acquitted them.11

 In August 1991, EOHR castigated the Prosecutor Gen eral for his 
unwillingness to investigate the torture of defenda nts accused in the October 
1990 assassination of Parliament speaker Rifat al-M ahgoub. In November 1990, 
EOHR had submitted a formal complaint to the Prosec utor General, urging a 
prompt investigation of the defendants' allegations  of torture and the 
commencement of legal action against those responsi ble.  The Prosecutor 
General did not act on the complaint.  Months later , however, the State Security 
Court hearing the case instructed a member of the c ourt to investigate the 
evidence of torture.  While applauding the court's action, EOHR argued that this 
duty to investigate, in the first instance, was a r esponsibility of the Prosecutor 
General: 
 
  EOHR is deeply concerned that the 
prosecution finds it sufficient to register the 
witnessing of injuries and marks on the 
bodies of the defendants along with their own 
testimony about the details of their torture, 
but makes no attempt to find out the cause 
that lies behind the presence of such signs of

brutal torture....This is especially [worrisome] 
since forensic medical reports show that the 
injuries suffered by the defendants occurred 
in a way and at a time that corresponds to the 
testimony of the defendants, at which time 
they were undergoing regular questioning by 
the public prosecutor.  
 
  The events of this case and the torture of the 
defendants in it raise an important question 
which EOHR has raised strongly on numerous 
occasions.  This is the question of...the laxity 
of the public prosecution in investigating 
torture complaints and in pursuing those 
who commit the crime of torture, its role 
being confined in the bulk of cases to mere 
recording of the witnessing of signs of 
injuries and bruises on the bodies of the 
victims without taking any subsequent 
measure.13 
 
 The lack of investigation and prosecution of SSI o fficers and soldiers for 
torture "is a problem of enforcement," one prominen t Egyptian lawyer told MEW.  
"Egyptian law criminalizes torture.  The issue is n ot the absence of laws, but the 
lack of will to enforce the laws."  He pointed out that the repetitive allegations of 
torture, including those that appear in the newspap ers on a regular basis, 
"indicate a consistent pattern.  These allegations should have been enough for the 
Prosecutor General to act."14

 Continued reports by Amnesty International, Egypti an lawyers and EOHR 
about the torture of detainees in SSI custody (see Appendix D), and Middle East 
Watch's own information-gathering about cases from 1989 to early 1992, indicate 
that the abuse of detainees in SSI custody has cont inued.  
 
 It is difficult if not impossible to estimate the number of detainees who 
are tortured on an annual basis in Egypt, not least  because some victims are too 
fearful of SSI's power to come forward and describe  their ordeals.  However, the 
many detailed testimonies of torture, facilitated b y the long-standing practice of 
incommunicado detention, indicate a pattern of abus e.  Moreover, the persistence 
of both torture and incommunicado detention suggest s that there is complicity in 
this pattern at the highest levels of government.

 Since 1989, there has been growing publicity about  torture in Egypt, and 
the government's response indicates the extreme sen sitivity with which reports of 
torture are viewed. On January 12, 1990, President Mubarak dismissed Interior 
Minister Zaki Badr; the decree announcing his repla cement gave no explanation 
for Badr's ouster.15  Later that month, newly appointed Interior Minist er Moussa 
delivered a speech at the Police Academy on Police Day.  He outlined "the main 
principles" governing the policy of the Interior Mi nistry, and declared: "We do not 
claim to be the custodians of democracy.  We define  its limits and process.  But we 
cannot disregard our responsibility to prevent crim e before it occurs and to apply 
the laws which punish the inciters to crime."  In a n oblique vow not to torture, Gen. 
Moussa pledged that the Interior Ministry would "re spect of human rights, as 
guaranteed by the laws and pacts, is an absolute ru le which has no exceptions, 
even in the case of the prisoner whose crime has be en confirmed and who has to 
be punished. In his case, we respect his dignity an d humanity."16

 When EOHR issued a report about torture in January  1990,  Interior 
Minister Moussa would not comment about the specifi c allegations in an 
interview with The Washington Post , ostensibly because the report was not issued 
by "an official organization."17  At a meeting of the Egyptian Press Association in  
May 1990, Minister Moussa discussed torture. The se mi-official Egyptian daily 
newspaper al-Jumhuriyya  reported his remarks as follows: 
 
  The interior minister...asserted that torture is 
a crime and that this is not his policy.  Why 
should I torture anyone?  Is it a hobby of 
mine?  He called on any citizen who receives 
information on torture cases to immediately 
refer the accused to the law.  The minister 
indicated that there are penalties according 
to the prisoners' sentences, like flogging and 
solitary confinement.  Some think this is 
torture.  Police inspectors, moreover, carry 
out surprise visits to the camps of the police 
forces and stations, and this is their right.18 
 
 More recently, as the problem of torture received increasing attention, 
the government criticized the role of human rights monitors.  In December 1991, 
EOHR announced that it was launching a one-year cam paign against torture in 
Egypt.  Since the campaign's inception, EOHR has is sued periodic updates on the 
campaign's progress.  In January 1992, Amnesty Inte rnational issued a report 
about political detentions, including cases in whic h victims were tortured.19  Also 
in January, it was widely viewed in human rights ci rcles that government officials 
                                                                    
     17Caryle Murphy, "Egypt Accused of Torturing Prisoner s," The Washington Post , January 30,

government's refusal to register the organization u nder the 1964 law of associations.  For

sought to intimidate rights monitors with statement s that allegations of torture 
were aimed at "striking a blow against stability an d distorting the system of 
government" and "distorting Egypt's reputation amon g international 
organizations."20   
 
 The subject of torture was discussed at a meeting of the Egyptian Cabinet 
on January 23, 1992, and a decision was made to for m a special committee -- 
composed of the Ministers of Interior, Justice, Inf ormation and Foreign Affairs -- to 
study ways to respond publicly to allegations of to rture.  Regrettably, this 
approach focused on improving the government's medi a strategies to counter 
reports of torture, rather than launching a serious  initiative by the president's 
inner circle to investigate the persistent allegati ons of torture and undertake firm 
measures to end the practice.  EOHR noted the commi ttee's formation and 
criticized the apparent lack of will at the highest  levels of the Egyptian 
government:  
 
  EOHR is...of the view that the cabinet would 
have been better occupied to set up a 
committee to investigate the allegations of 
torture with a view to ascertaining their truth 
or falsity rather than to hasten to 
categorically deny them.  EOHR's struggle to 
bring an end to the shameful and barbaric 
crime of torture is in fact an expression of its 
concern for Egypt's "reputation among 
international organizations." EOHR is totally 
incapable of understanding the view that a 
country is not shamed by the continued use 
of torture within it, but rather by the exposure 
of torture in the media.21 
 
 In May 1992, President Mubarak suggested what may be a more positive 
approach to the issue when he affirmed Egypt's resp ect for human rights, and

pledged that "anyone who attacks a citizen will not  be protected."  Unfortunately, 
he also introduced a threatening element in his rem arks when he noted that it 
was "unacceptable for human rights to be used as a pretext for interference in 
domestic affairs."22  The remarks were made at a meeting with members o f the 
Egyptian media.  The President said: "The principle  we uphold is to respect human 
rights and reject anything which harms man's dignit y.  As for mistakes made in 
this respect, there is the judiciary, which is just  in Egypt."  According to the official 
Egyptian news agency's account, 
 
  [The President] asserted that anyone who 
attacks a citizen will not be protected.  He 
said that he is more concerned about human 
rights than anyone in Egypt, stressing that 
any offender will be referred to the judiciary 
without hesitation.  He noted that torture 
cases will not be disregarded by the passage 
of time.23

 One theme that has marked the official denials of torture is the 
characterization of victims in a manner designed to  discredit them.  "We are 
dealing with fanatics who use violence," one Interi or Ministry official told MEW in 
1990.24  "Complaints about torture at SSI offices normally  are presented by 
persons who are members of extremist groups," Prose cutor General el-Araby 
stated to MEW in 1992.25

 It is undeniable that Egypt has faced internal vio lence attributed to 
clandestine Islamist groups and factions over the l ast decade, and that this 
violence -- coupled with often-violent responses by  security forces -- continues 
until today.26  But the fact that torture victims may be suspecte d radical or violent 
Islamists does not justify the practice of torture,  which is proscribed by the 
Egyptian Constitution, Egyptian law and internation al law.27  Indeed, torture 
victims' alleged actions and political affiliations  are irrelevant to this serious 
human rights abuse.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which Egypt has ratified, proscribes torture absolu tely, even in the event of a 
public emergency that threatens the life of the nat ion.28 
                                                                    
     26Cairo-based journalist Max Rodenbeck reported in Ma rch 1992: "In the province of 
Fayyum, south of the capital, police are still payi ng for the excessive zeal with which they 
machine-gunned 16 members of a local extremist grou p in March 1990.  [In February 1992], 
two irrigation inspectors were shot dead near the v illage of Kahk where the massacre took 
place, apparently after they stumbled on a group of  villagers training with firearms.  A few 
day later gunmen on a motorcycle ambushed and kille d a senior officer in the state security 
investigation service as he was leaving his office in the provincial capital.  The officer had 
been responsible for security operations in Kahk.  The arrest of some 75 people and 
subsequent interrogations revealed that his killers  had come from the village ... The newly 
appointed security director of Fayyum vowed last we ek to `cleanse' the province by 
`breaking the necks' of anyone who attacks the poli ce."  Max Rodenbeck, "Struggle against 
extremists," Middle East International , March 20, 1992, p. 12.   
     27Article 42 of the Egyptian Constitution states: "An y person arrested, detained or his 
freedom restricted shall be treated in the manner c oncomitant with the preservation of his 
dignity.  No physical or moral harm is to be inflic ted upon him.  He may not be detained or 
imprisoned except in places defined by laws organis ing prisons. If a confession is proved 
to have been made by a person under any of the afor ementioned forms of duress or 
coercion, it shall be considered invalid and futile ."  Article 57 states: "Any assault on 
individual freedom or on the inviolability of priva te life of citizens and any other public 
rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution  and the law shall be considered a crime, 
whose criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to p rescription.  The state shall grant a fair 
compensation to the victim of such an assault." 
     28Article 4(2).  In addition, Article 2(2) of the Con vention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which  Egypt acceded to on June 25, 1986, 
states: "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, w hether a state of war or a threat of 
war, internal political instability or any other pu blic emergency, may be invoked as a     G G GGOVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT II IINVESTIGATIONS NVESTIGATIONS NVESTIGATIONS NVESTIGATIONS $$ $$    127127127127    
 
 
 In addition, while it is true that currently in Eg ypt most torture victims are 
believed to be members or supporters of radical Isl amic organizations or factions 
that the government has implicated in violence, thi s is not a complete picture of 
who is tortured in Egypt.  First, security force dr agnets sometimes are cast so wide 
that arbitrary arrests occur and detainees may be t ortured for information they 
simply do not possess.  Second, politically charged  statements by Egyptian 
government officials about "Islamic fanatics" ignor e past practice and the 
personal profiles of some of the Egyptians who have  been tortured in the last three 
years.   
 
 In August 1989, for example, trade unionist Mustaf a Naib, a worker at the 
steel plant in Helwan south of Cairo, was tortured during interrogation about the 
circumstances surrounding the dramatic workers' sit -in at the plant.  The Helwan 
facility, with 24,000 workers, is one of the larges t iron and steel works in Egypt 
(see Appendix B for Naib's account).  Naib is not a  radical Islamist.  He was 
interrogated about his involvement in the workers' action, and the role of the 
leftist National Progressive Unionist Party.  In 19 91, SSI officers and soldiers 
tortured psychiatrist Dr. Muhammed Mandour in Febru ary and Muhammed Afifi 
Mattar, the celebrated Egyptian poet, in March; nei ther man was known to be 
involved in advocating or practicing violence.   
 
 Among the Egyptians who have suffered torturers' b lindfolds, beatings, 
hangings, electric shocks and other abuses are lawy ers who defend politically 
unpopular clients, journalists affiliated with Isla mist opposition publications, 
Muslim Brotherhood members who express opinions at odds with the 
government, Christians suspected by the authorities  of converting Muslims to 
Christianity, and individual citizens targeted by s ecurity force operatives solely 
because they are thought to possess valued informat ion, such as the address of a 
security suspect.

Article 42 and Article 57 of the Egyptian Constitut ion,29 and constitutes a crime 
with no statute of limitations under Egyptian law.  He emphasized that 
investigations of torture are carried out by the ju dicial authority -- of which the 
Prosecutor General's office is a part -- and stress ed several times that the judicial 
branch is separate from, and independent of, the ex ecutive branch of 
government.30  He assured MEW that all complaints submitted to t he Ministry of 
Justice are investigated. 
 
 Reflecting the Egyptian government's extreme sensi tivity to reports of 
abuse by international human rights organizations, Chancellor el-Araby noted that 
reports of torture by domestic and international mo nitoring groups "have no 
effect on official investigation bodies.  It's bett er if a person presents the 
complaint himself to official government bodies bef ore going to foreign 
organizations."  He assured MEW that allegations of  torture either have been 
investigated or that the complaints are still under  investigation.  He said that 
when an investigation commences, the alleged victim  is "the first to be 
questioned."  Then the person is sent for a forensi c medical examination and after 
that the investigation continues. 
 
 Chancellor el-Araby told MEW that in October 1991 he had personally 
assumed direct oversight of the torture complaints made to prosecutors. He said 
that with "the campaign [against torture] mounting,  I requested that all district 
niyaba send to me immediately all complaints and in vestigation results."  He said 
that there are not many complaints.  MEW asked Chan cellor el-Araby if it could 
receive information about torture complaints that h ave been made to his office, 
including the location were the torture allegedly o ccurred.  The Prosecutor 
General expressed no objections to providing this i nformation, but said that 
statistics were not yet compiled, since complaints come to his office from various 
prosecutors' offices around the country. 
 
 Chancellor el-Araby pointed out that there is an " apparatus" in his office 
specifically charged with looking at prosecutors' r eports.  He said that one of its 
purposes is to review the actions of local prosecut ors, and to take action against 
those who ignore complaints.  "All complainants hav e the right to be heard and

investigated," the Prosecutor General told MEW. "Fo r torture, there are specific 
instructions that the district niyaba himself must investigate the complaint."    
  
 MEW spoke with Muhammed Shawfik, a prosecutor and an assistant to 
Chancellor el-Araby, who explained in greater detai l how torture complaints are 
handled by prosecutors.31   "Just an allegation of torture will start an 
investigation," he said.  He noted that a complaint  should include: an allegation of 
torture or mistreatment, a description of the abuse , the location where the abuse 
occurred, and identification of the alleged perpetr ator.  He said that without this 
information, a case will not be referred for prosec ution, but indicated that an 
investigation could still proceed and, ultimately, the victim could be eligible for 
financial compensation if torture by state agents i s found, even if particular 
torturers cannot be identified.   
 
 The steps of the investigation process are three-f old, and at any juncture 
the investigation can be halted.  After the receipt  of a complaint, a niyaba will meet 
with the alleged victim for an initial investigatio n and ask questions about the 
allegations.  If the niyaba believes the allegation s are credible, and sees evidence 
of torture, he will prepare a report and refer the person for a forensic medical 
examination.  Unless there is a forensic medical re port, a prosecution cannot 
proceed, according to Shawfik.  
 
 Both the niyaba and the forensic pathologist will attempt to ascertain 
that the victim's wounds were not self-inflicted.  Shawfik explained, for example, 
that if the skin is placed and squeezed between two  coins, the resulting marks can 
resemble those caused by a whip.  A case will be cl osed if the forensic medical 
examination reveals that the wounds were self-infli cted.  
 
 If a medical determination is made that the wounds  were not self-
inflicted, an attempt is made to identify what poss ible methods could have been 
used to cause the injuries, and to identify a perpe trator. If identification is not 
possible, the case does not proceed, according to S hawfik, and the file remains 
open -- presumably indefinitely, as there is no sta tute of limitations for torture.  
MEW raised the issue of the impossibility in many c ases for blindfolded victims to 
identify their assailants and inquired whether pros ecutors took any steps in such 
cases to investigate the personnel who may have bee n on duty at the time the

torture was alleged to have occurred.  Shawfik resp onded by pointing to the 
difficulty of such an investigation: "At Lazoughly,  there are hundreds, maybe 500, 
on duty at any one time," he said.   
   
 This problem reveals the need for SSI to be requir ed to maintain and 
make available detailed records about detainees who  are brought to its facilities 
for investigation. Since Interior Ministry official s conceded to MEW in May 1990 
that detainees may be held for up to twenty-four ho urs for investigation at SSI 
headquarters (see Chapter Two), there should be a p ermanent record-keeping 
system in place, accessible to any investigating ni yaba and to torture victims' 
lawyers, which identifies the following on a daily basis:  
 
 *  the names of all detainees brought for investig ation.  
 
 *  the time of each detainee's arrival and the nam e of the officer 
accompanying the detainee.  
 
 *  the specific location within the SSI building w here the investigation 
was conducted.  
 
 *  the time period, or time periods, when the inve stigation was conducted.  
 
 *  the officer and other personnel present during the investigation.  
 
 *  the time of a detainee's departure from the bui lding.  
 
 *  the location to which a detainee was taken afte r he or she left SSI 
headquarters, if the individual was not released fr om custody after the 
investigation.  Such information should be accompan ied by the name of the 
officer commanding the force that removed a detaine e from SSI headquarters for 
transfer to another facility.   
 
 Similar record-keeping systems should be maintaine d at every SSI office 
in Egypt where detainees are brought for investigat ion.  The maintenance of such 
a system would enhance accountability in cases in w hich allegations of 
mistreatment are made, and facilitate the niyaba's investigation of such 
allegations.  The lack of detailed record-keeping i s an invitation to the use of 
torture during interrogation sessions at SSI facili ties.

 As indicated in Chapter Two, in some cases of tort ure the authorities 
dispute that the victim was in custody at the time the mistreatment occurred.  
MEW asked Shawfik about this problem, using the exa mple of Dr. Muhammed 
Mandour, who was held and tortured at SSI headquart ers in February 1991 (see 
Chapter Two for additional information about Dr. Ma ndour's incommunicado 
detention, which was unacknowledged by the authorit ies).   
 
 Shawfik replied that the burden was on Dr. Mandour  to prove that he was 
arrested on the date he said he was arrested.  MEW noted that Dr. Mandour was 
taken in the middle of the night in front of two wi tnesses, his mother and a 
colleague, and asked why prosecutors could not inte rview these witnesses to 
ascertain the date of the arrest and then determine  where Dr. Mandour was 
detained following his arrest.  Rather than promise  to pursue this obvious 
investigative lead, Shawfik responded that Dr. Mand our's mother would not be a 
good witness.  
 
 In a February 2, 1992 letter to Chancellor el-Arab y, MEW noted that there 
have been persistent complaints by detainees, lawye rs and human rights 
organizations about the ill-treatment of detainees held at SSI headquarters. MEW 
informed the Prosecutor General that one of the sub jects it wished to discuss 
during the forthcoming meeting with him was whether , given these complaints, 
his office had ever instructed that this facility b e inspected, the date or dates of 
such inspections, and their outcome.   
 
 At the meeting with Chancellor el-Araby on Februar y 5, MEW inquired if he 
had received any complaints about torture in SSI of fices such as the headquarters 
building at Lazoughly Square.  He replied that "the  niyaba has received such 
complaints but not for a specific case."  (Appendix  D of this report lists the 
complaints about torture at Lazoughly submitted to the Prosecutor General's 
office by EOHR in 1990 and 1991.)  Then, in apparen t contradiction of this 
statement, he later went on to say, dismissively, t hat "complaints about torture at 
SSI offices normally are presented by persons who a re members of extremist 
groups."  MEW asked the Prosecutor General for stat istics about the number of 
complaints submitted to his office concerning tortu re that allegedly took places 
in SSI offices. As of the date of the publication o f this report, MEW has not received 
this information.

 Egyptian lawyers and human rights monitors critici ze the niyaba and the 
Prosecutor General's office for failing to act on w ritten complaints about specific 
cases of torture.  When a lawyer presents a complai nt directly to the niyaba, 
asking him to investigate a case, "the niyaba doesn 't move.  The complaint is not 
recognized," one experienced defense lawyer told ME W. "There is simply no reply.  
We don't have prosecutors in the real meaning of th e word. There are orders for 
these complaints not to be acknowledged, military o rders," he charged.  (A 
comprehensive study of Egypt issued by the U.S. gov ernment acknowledged that 
as of early 1990 senior Egyptian military officials  continued to hold key positions 
in the Ministry of Interior.32) 
 
 Egyptian human rights monitors face a similar prob lem. Written 
complaints about specific cases of torture submitte d by the Egyptian Organization 
for Human Rights are simply not acknowledged by the  Prosecutor General's office 
or local prosecutors (see Appendix D for a list of complaints submitted by EOHR in 
1990 and 1991). In its report on the human rights s ituation in Egypt in 1990, EOHR 
noted that it had "submitted official complaints to  the Prosecutor General on the 
most important cases of torture during 1990, but... received no information 
regarding the beginning of any investigation."33    
 
 This continued to be EOHR's experience in 1991.  S ince Chancellor el-
Araby assumed direct oversight of the complaint-mak ing process in October 1991,

 The lack of action by the Prosecutor General's off ice in the case of the 
torture of Muhammed Afifi Mattar, the prominent Egy ptian poet, illustrates the 
problems that lawyers face (see Appendix A for Matt ar's account of torture during 
his ten days of incommunicado detention at SSI head quarters).  In a reply to an 
inquiry by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture a bout Mattar's case, the Egyptian 
authorities stated that Mattar and those who visite d him in prison did not submit 
any complaints to the judicial authorities about th e poet's mistreatment.34   
 
 Mattar's lawyer, Sayyid Abu Zeid, told MEW a diffe rent story. He said that 
he learned immediately of Mattar's arrest in March 1991 from his family. The first 
problem the lawyer faced was discovering where his client was being held in 
detention:  "I immediately began to make the rounds .  I could not locate him and I 
was not able to see him until he was brought to Tor a prison."  When Abu Zeid 
visited Mattar in prison, he discovered that his cl ient had been tortured: "He had 
been badly tortured at the SSI building in Lazoughl y.  He was unable to speak and 
was very tired. He had circle-like wounds around hi s wrists, from hanging or 
electric  burns."    
 
  After seeing him, I went the next day to the

Prosecutor General to ask that Mattar not be 
tortured again.  The Prosecutor General 
promised this, and in fact he was not. 
 
  Then I went to court and informed the court of 
Mattar's arrest.  The court ruled that he 
should be released but he wasn't because the 
Interior Minister used the emergency law to 
object.  I waited fifteen days and brought 
another case.  The court ruled to uphold its 
first release order but Mattar still was not 
released.  Eventually he was let go, because 
the power of the law prevailed.35 
 
 Abu Zeid told MEW that a week after Mattar's relea se, he returned to the 
Prosecutor General with Afifi Mattar, and that the poet handed the Prosecutor 
General a written complaint.  
 
 In direct contradiction to the information provide d by the Egyptian 
government to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, Abu Zeid  told MEW that he made two 
interventions before the judicial authorities on be half of his client: "I went 
personally to see the Prosecutor General and spoke to him about the torture. I 
went directly to the Prosecutor General because it is his duty to intercede. When I 
went before the court, I informed them of the tortu re."  Abu Zeid further reported 
that there had been no action on Afifi Mattar's tor ture complaint by the Prosecutor 
General's office, as of the date of his interview w ith MEW.

 Abdul Wahab was at work on November 10, 1991, and received a written 
summons to meet an officer "for two minutes only" a t the police station, which is 
located next door. When he arrived, he was ordered to stay until midnight.  "I was

niyaba found no grounds for his continued detention . But from the niyaba, he was 
taken to the SSI building in nearby Zifta.  "I was locked in a dirty room in the 
basement. There was no mattress, no blanket, no foo d or water.  On the second day, 
I was brought to Sami Awad, a former student of min e, who ordered that I be 
handcuffed." 
 
 He was taken to the Tanta office of SSI "not in th eir blue police cars but in 
a car they flagged down."  There was another detain ee with him in the vehicle.  He 
was blindfolded when he arrived at the building.  T here, three officers began to 
question him about his opinions: in addition to Sam i Awad, he said the other two 
officers were named `Ez and Barkhouki.   He said he  was questioned about the 
Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic groups and ask ed if he supported them.  He 
was asked no questions about criminal activities.    
 
 After the interrogation, the handcuffs were remove d and he was left in 
the room for a few hours.  Then his hands were tied  behind his back and his 
blindfold was tightened.   
 
  They moved me around, turning me, to 
disorient me.  They said that my words would 
not be recorded and urged me to speak.  I 
heard the rustling of papers. I expected 
deception.  At first they didn't hit me because 
there probably was a tape recorder and they 
didn't want my cries on it.  After I said that I 
knew nothing, they took me out of the room. 
 
 At some time after midnight, he was electric shock ed on his head and 
ears while he was cursed with "unimaginably dirty w ords, filthy words."  He did not 
know where the shocks were coming from: "The room w as full of the breaths of 
many people, in front of me, behind me."  He also w as kicked and punched on 
sensitive parts of his body and on his ears, and re membered fists "coming at me 
from the left and the right."  His clothes were tor n. 
 
 Abdul Wahab was brought to a dirty room that had n o mattress or 
blankets. He was allowed to use a toilet only once a day.  He was held in the room     136 136136136    $$ $$    GG GGOVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT II IINVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONS     
 
for seven days and subjected to "continuous insults ," the same insults used 
during his torture.  After seven days, his blindfol d was removed and he was taken 
to be fingerprinted and foot-printed.  "I saw anoth er Muslim Brother who had been 
released by the niyaba but was still being held," h e said.  He was handcuffed, put in 
a van and transferred to Abu Za`bal prison, where h e was held without charge "for 
two long months." 
 
 He provided MEW with copies of the results of two medical examinations 
he had after his release from prison.  The first ex am, conducted by Dr. Maoudi 
Hamdi Gharabeh of the Ibn al-Nafees Islamic Medical  Association in Tanta on 
December 31, 1991, diagnosed a vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye.  The second 
examination, conducted on January 20, 1992 by Dr. A shraf Muhammed Abdu of the 
Students Education Hospital at Tanta University, al so found a hemorrhage in the 
right eye.  The doctor noted in his report that a r equest had been made to submit a 
copy of the medical report to the Tanta niyaba. 
 
 MEW asked Abdul Wahab if he made a complaint to th e authorities about 
his torture.  He said that his lawyer "made a case"  and complained to prosecutors 
in Cairo and Tanta.  "Papers were sent to the niyab a in Tanta but I was never 
summoned," he said.  "Everything stopped."36 
 
 Some Egyptians point to institutional factors as o ne explanation for the 
lack of action by prosecutors on complaints about t orture by SSI.  Lawyers and 
rights monitors contend that there are ties between  the niyaba and security 
forces, which impinge upon the independence of the prosecutorial authorities 
when confronted with allegations of SSI misconduct.   "Over the last twenty years, 
many SSI officers have received law degrees from th e Police College and move on 
to positions as state security prosecutors," one hu man rights monitor told MEW.  
Through the four-year program at the Police College  in Cairo, police and security 
officers receive law degrees, and thus can apply fo r positions as prosecutors. 
There is an annual examination to fill assistant-pr osecutor positions ( musaed 
wakil niyaba ); the Prosecutor General makes these appointments.   Egyptian rights 
monitors say that it is "an increasingly prevalent practice" for former SSI officers 
to be appointed to positions in the state security niyaba, where -- among other 
duties -- they may have responsibility for oversigh t of the activities of former 
colleagues in SSI.

 More generally, critics of the government's failur e to investigate and 
prosecute torturers argue that Egypt is an authorit arian state, albeit with some 
liberalizing tendencies, and that prosecutors do no t see themselves as 
independent of the executive branch of government. The problem begins at the 
top. 
 
 One former high-ranking officer in the Ministry of  Interior noted that the 
prosecutor general -- who is ultimately responsible  for investigations of torture 
complaints -- is a senior official in the Ministry of Justice but that he is not truly 
independent of the executive branch. "The prosecuto r general is appointed by 
presidential decree.  The president can select some one who is not in line based 
on seniority.  The prosecutor general must be submi ssive.  If he doesn't walk in 
harmony with SSI, he will lose favor."   A former M inistry of Interior general told 
MEW: "The current prosecutor general was part of th e state security niyaba and he 
never took a stance on torture."37  
 
 The problem of the lack of independence permeates the prosecutor's 
office. "There is no tradition that a niyaba looks at himself as separate from the 
executive branch.  The niyaba does not recognize hi mself as truly independent 
and he does not make trouble.  If he makes trouble,  he doesn't get ahead," an 
experienced Egyptian human rights monitor said.38  This was affirmed by veteran 
journalist Philip Gallab, who told MEW in a intervi ew before his death: 
"Prosecutors have a deep relationship with the gove rnment.  This is a possible 
defect."39  
 
 Fear of SSI's power cannot be discounted as an imp ortant factor 
inhibiting vigorous action on the part of prosecuto rs against SSI officers: "They let 
them do what they want," one defense lawyer said bi tterly.40  Another lawyer told 
MEW that some prosecutors privately admit that thei r hands are tied. "In Ma'adi [a

district of Cairo], prosecutors informally tell law yers that they cannot pursue 
torture complaints or they themselves will be hange d in Lazoughly," he said.  He 
also noted that some prosecutors will try to shift the responsibility for an 
investigation to a niyaba in another district.  "In  one case, I went to the prosecutor 
in Dokki to complain about torture in the Giza offi ce of SSI and he transferred the 
complaint to the Imbaba prosecutor, because this wa s the neighborhood where 
the victim lived."

 Some of the most incriminating evidence of torture  has come from 
forensic medical examinations of victims conducted by Ministry of Justice 
physicians.41  But MEW found cases of alleged torture in which p rosecutors did not 
respond to 
complaints in a 
timely fashion, thus 
delaying victims' 
referral for 
examination. Two 
Egyptian defense 
lawyers who have 
represented many 
torture victims told 
MEW that "in most 
cases, the victim's 
presentation to state medical examiners is delayed. "42  This is a critical lapse 
because in many cases of torture, timely examinatio n is essential before marks, 
scars, or other signs of physical abuse lessen or d isappear as time passes. 
 
 There are two ways to trigger a forensic medical e xamination. The first, 
discussed above, is when a complaint is submitted d irectly to a prosecutor.  The 
second is when, during an investigation of a detain ee, a niyaba sees physical

the case.  We have criticized the Prosecutor Genera l 
for not following through with cases.  There's a wa ll

evidence of possible torture.  He should then write  a memorandum describing the 
injuries and the victim's allegations about their c ause. The memorandum is 
submitted to the Department of Forensic Medicine in  the Ministry of Justice, and 
the detainee is referred for a medical examination.     
 
 A forensic pathologist then examines the victim an d submits a report to 
the niyaba.  But A "positive" forensic medical exam ination -- that is, one indicating 
that the victim's injuries are not incompatible wit h the victim's allegations about 
the time and type of physical abuse -- is a necessa ry but not sufficient condition 
for a niyaba to proceed with an investigation.  
 
 One experienced defense lawyer told MEW that there  often is no action 
on cases after a victim is submitted to a forensic medical exam: "The niyaba starts 
a case but does not proceed with the case.  We have  criticized the Prosecutor 
General for not following through with cases.  Ther e's a wall in front of the cases."  
In his own work as a lawyer over the last seven yea rs he filed between 3,000 and 
4,000 complaints, a stack of papers about nine inch es high on his bookshelf.  
"Cover your eyes and take any piece of paper," he s aid dramatically.  "There has 
not been one prosecution!"43  A former general in the Ministry of Interior 
confirmed that prosecutors face obstacles at higher  levels if they attempt to 
pursue a case, stating that "an honest investigatio n by a niyaba will simply get 
stalled once it is referred to the prosecutor gener al's office."44  Another defense 
lawyer told MEW: "The local prosecutor must go to t he prosecutor general's office 
for an order that the investigation continue," anot her defense lawyer told MEW, 
indicating that this is the stage at which investig ations become stalled.   
 
 If a niyaba does not have contact with a torture v ictim following his 
period of incommunicado detention, there is a secon d route for initiating the 
complaint process. After seeing a client who has be en tortured, usually when the 
client has been moved to a prison, a lawyer may ini tiate a request for a medical 
examination by submitting a complaint to the niyaba . But attorneys told MEW that 
in many cases the complaint is simply ignored or th e victim is not summoned to 
give testimony to the niyaba in a timely fashion, w hich in turn delays the medical 
examination.  The following cases are illustrative:

Torture of a University Student in November 1991Torture of a University Student in November 1991Torture of a University Student in November 1991Torture of a University Student in November 1991  
 
 Ayman Nimr, a student at Suez Canal University, wa s arrested on 
November 12, 1991, by an SSI force accompanied by t he chief security officer at the 
university's College of Art. After being briefly he ld at al-Arab detention facility with 
criminals, he was moved later the same day to the S SI building in Port Said, where 
he was blindfolded and handcuffed.   
 
 Nimr told his lawyers that he was taken up three f lights of stairs and 
stripped of his clothes by SSI officers Ashraf Makl ouf and Ashraf Ibrahim.  He was 
then beaten by these two officers, a third whom he named as Ahmad al-Shurbagy, 
and two security officers at Suez University: Muham med Fathy of the College of Art 
and Medhat Marwan of the engineering faculty.  The men also cursed Nimr and 
threatened to rape his sister.  The two university security officers and an SSI 
officer then carried Nimr, who was naked, into an a ir-conditioned room and tied 
him up.  According to his complaint, soldiers were ordered to insert a stick in his 
anus. Nimr next was hanged from a pole "like a slau ghtered animal" and a flame 
was placed underneath him, burning the soles of his  feet. He then was electric-
shocked over a five-hour period. Nimr told his lawy ers that his interrogators were 
seeking information about the activities of Islamis t groups.  
 
 On December 7, 1991, two days after seeing Nimr in  Abu Za`bal prison, 
where he had been transferred from the SSI building , lawyers presented a written 
complaint to the head of the eastern Port Said pros ecution office.  The complaint 
stated that their client had been detained in the S SI building in violation of the law, 
described the allegations of torture and included t he names of the five men 
mentioned above. The complaint also requested that the niyaba hear testimony 
from Nimr and refer him immediately for a forensic medical examination before 
the marks of his torture diminished further.  In Fe bruary 1992, MEW asked Mukhtar 
Nouh, one of Nimr's lawyers, about the action taken  on the complaint.  "There's 
been no reply," he reported.  The Egyptian Organiza tion for Human Rights also 
submitted a complaint about the case directly to th e Prosecutor General on 
December 1, 1991.  The complaint was assigned numbe r 8510.  EOHR reported in 
January 1992 that it has "yet to receive any indica tion that the...Prosecutor has 
initiated any investigation into its complaint."45

 The problem of the lack of timely action by prosec utors in cases of 
alleged torture is not new, as the action taken on this high-profile case of torture 
in 1989 indicates.  Nezar Ghorab is a young lawyer whose father is a prominent 
appeals court judge. Nezar was arrested by security  forces at his family's home in 
the early morning hours of October 9, 1989. After p ressure from his father's 
colleagues in the judiciary, President Hosni Mubara k ordered Nezar released after 
thirteen days in detention. During most of his dete ntion, he was held 
incommunicado and tortured at SSI headquarters in L azoughly Square. 
 
 He told MEW that when he was brought for interroga tion at Lazoughly he 
was stripped to his underwear.  Electricity was app lied to his lips, nipples and 
fingertips.  "Each single shock lasted a very short  time, but was repeated over a 
long period. It was one session that lasted about a n hour, with intermittent 
questions,"  he said.  In addition, he was suspende d over the top of a door.  He was 
tied to the bars of a high window, with his feet st ill touching the ground.  He was 
beaten, kicked and punched.  He said it seemed that  one person was inflicting the 
physical abuse but there were possibly others in th e room.  He was tortured for 
three days and then brought to Tora Istikbal, where  he was held for two days in 
solitary confinement.  Then he was returned to Lazo ughly for three more days.   
 
 Nezar was investigated by the niyaba on October 16 , 1989, and released 
from detention after thirteen days.  On October 17,  1989, Nezar's father, Chancellor 
Mahmoud Abd el-Hamid Ghorab, delivered a letter to the Prosecutor General 
stating he had learned that his son had been tortur ed at SSI headquarters.  Citing 
Article 42 of the Egyptian Constitution and Article  22 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, Chancellor Ghorab wrote: "I hope that you dem and an investigation 
concerning this incident and visit the headquarters  of SSI in Lazoughly, examine 
the tools which were used to torture my son, seize them, and take the appropriate 
measures with the responsible authorities."       142 142142142    $$ $$    GG GGOVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT II IINVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONS     
 
 
  There was no immediate action on the complaint. " They played a 
common game of shifting the complaint from office t o office,"  Nezar said.  He 
showed MEW 
copies of internal 
Justice Ministry 
documents 
detailing the buck-
passing. It was not 
until five months 
later that a 
prosecutor 
summoned Nezar to 
give testimony 
about his torture.  
 
 The Deputy General Prosecutor of the Abdeen prosec ution office, 
Muhammed Daoud, requested that Nezar meet him on Ma rch 12, 1990, "because of 
the importance of the matter."  The case had been a ssigned  number 2-80-1990, 
and the letter stated that the summons was related to "the investigations 
undertaken by the Prosecutor General."  Nezar told MEW that his father advised 
him not to appear before the niyaba.  After five mo nths, physical evidence of the 
abuse had disappeared; in a follow-up letter to Pro secutor Daoud, Chancellor 
Ghorab wrote that "all the evidence is gone and we leave it to God." 
 
 Why was Nezar Ghorab detained and what was the pos sible purpose of 
his torture?  He had no definitive explanation of w hat this meant, but pointed out to 
MEW that in one case of administrative detention hi s father had written in the 
minutes of the court that judicial rulings in admin istrative detention cases are not 
respected.  Nezar said that his father also had exp ressed this view in a 
memorandum to the Prosecutor General.  One SSI offi cer had told Nezar, "We'll 
frame you in a crime because of what your father is  doing."

 A timely initial investigation of a torture victim  by the niyaba, and

of the torture of Baha'a Fuaad Buktur Hanna, a Chri stian merchant, by five security-
forces personnel at the police station in Heliopoli s.  Buktur was accused of 
converting Muslims to Christianity. "I didn't do an ything wrong.  I have no political 
affiliations," Buktur told MEW emphatically during an interview.  
 
 Despite the evidence contained in two forensic med ical reports by 
Ministry of Justice physicians, accompanying medica l documents by private 
doctors, and Buktur's eagerness to cooperate with p rosecutors, the niyaba closed 
the case in perfunctory fashion and refused to acco mpany the victim to the police 
station to identify the officers who had tortured h im.  The Egyptian Organization for 
Human Rights submitted a written complaint about th is case to the Prosecutor 
General's office on May 22, 1991.  
 
"It's As If You Were Never Here""It's As If You Were Never Here""It's As If You Were Never Here""It's As If You Were Never Here"    
 
 Buktur, forty years old, is a resident of Ain Sham s and the father of four 
children. He provided MEW with detailed testimony a bout his torture, and 
described his repeated efforts to work with the niy aba to pursue an investigation 
of his complaint: 
 
 On May 9, 1991, between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m., Buktur  was taken from his 
shop in Cairo by an SSI officer and brought to the second floor of the police station 
in Heliopolis. He was brought to another officer, w ho took his identity card and told 
him to return at nine o'clock that evening.  Buktur  went home and returned to the 
station at the appointed time.  His wife and son ca me with him, and waited outside 
the police station in their car. 
 
  I was taken to the second floor to an office.  I 
was met by an officer in civilian clothes, who 
asked me questions:  "Why do you speak 
about religion?  Why don't you like the 
Koran?  Why do you insult the President?  Is 
there a girl you want to convert to 
Christianity?"   
 
 Buktur was slapped about the face.  The officer th en called out and five 
men entered the office.  His trousers and underclot hes were removed and he was 
told to lie face-down.  A large bald man held Buktu r's head between his feet.  A 
black electric "stick," with a tapered tip, was plu gged into a socket.  It was 
inserted into his anus and moved up his back, along  the spine. "My body began to     144 144144144    $$ $$    GG GGOVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT II IINVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONSNVESTIGATIONS     
 
convulse and jerk from the pain, and they put a cha ir over my back," Buktur told 
MEW. He said that he believed the instrument made n o noise, but that is was 
difficult for him to hear because of the way his he ad was being held by the bald 
man. 
 
 He was instructed to stand, and then was beaten ab out the face, followed 
by the administration of more electricity.  "Speak! " he was told.  "Tell me what to 
say," he pleaded.  "I'll sign whatever you want."  He told MEW that this treatment 
continued from about 9:00 p.m. until 11:30 p.m.   
 
  At first I was conscious, then I fainted.  They 
slapped me and beat me, then used 
electricity again.  They hit me with their 
hands and feet on my neck, my face, my 
stomach.  One of them kicked me from one 
side of the room to the other.  
 
  I remember one punch to the face -- it felt as 
if my whole jaw, cheek and ear were on fire. 
"Does it hurt?"  I said yes.  Then he hit me on 
the other side, so I wouldn't say it hurt again.  
"Don't think we have anything to fear," one of 
the men told him.  "We can throw you on the 
street.  No one will ask about you.  We are not 
responsible.  It's as if you were never here." 
 
 The officer then threatened that they would bring Buktur's wife and rape 
her, and asked for his home telephone number.  "I t old them that my wife was 
outside in the car.  I don't know why I said that,"  Buktur recounted.  The officer then 
took him to another room and told him to wash his f ace and put on his clothes, 
while they prepared an arrest warrant.  "I was afra id they were going downstairs 
to get my wife." 
 
  They told me that they can let me go and tell 
the emir of an Islamic group to burn down my 
shop and my house.  "Do you have 
daughters?" one officer asked.  I told him that 
I have three.  "When you go home you won't 
find them there.  Who is your priest?  
Goddamn you and your priest.  The emir of an     G G GGOVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT OVERNMENT II IINVESTIGATIONS NVESTIGATIONS NVESTIGATIONS NVESTIGATIONS $$ $$    145145145145    
 
Islamic group will rape your wife and your 
daughters.  These groups would love a tip 
about a person like you."   
 
 Buktur was taken to an officer in another room who  said he would be 
released.  He also was told that he should return a t 9:00 p.m. the next night to face 
the individuals who accused him of trying to conver t them to Christianity. "Another 
officer said that they should not release me becaus e I would try to put pressure on 
these people.  I asked them how I could pressure pe ople I didn't even know," 
Buktur told MEW.  Before Buktur left, one of the me n approached him 
apologetically: "He told me not to be angry, that t hey were just carrying out orders. 
 He said that I had not done anything, that maybe t here was a mistake or maybe 
this was just a present to someone important whom I  angered." 
 
 It struck Buktur as odd that his interrogators acc used him of making 
problems between 
Christians and 
Muslims.  "I spent 
thirteen years in 
the army.  I fought 
in the 1973 war.  I 
don't live in a 
Christian quarter.  
There are only 
three or four 
Christians in my 
neighborhood.  We have no problems.  We go to our M uslim neighbors' weddings.  I 
give credit to Muslims who come to my shop, even if  I know they can't pay me back. 
The only time I felt my Christianness was when they  were torturing me.  My best 
friends are Muslims, and they helped me after this experience."  
 
 Buktur returned home with his wife, physically dev astated and unable to 
move.  He experienced severe headaches and convulsi ons. He went to a doctor the 
next day, who gave him an injection for the pain an d sent him to a hospital for an X-
ray, of what turned out to be a broken jaw.  He wen t to a clinic to have his jaw set. 
He visited a psychiatrist because he had become inc ontinent.  "Then I realized that 
I was impotent.  I feel that I've lost control over  my life, over everything," he told "I went to the niyaba in bandages....Each time he t old 
me to come back.  I went there for five days but wa s 
never interviewed.  They would tell me to come in t he

 Despite his injuries, Buktur doggedly pursued a co mplaint to the 
authorities about his case.  He met with a lawyer;  he also visited the Egyptian 
Organization for Human Rights some three days after  the incident.  "I went to the 
niyaba in bandages, the day after my operation.  Ea ch time he told me to come 
back. I went there for five days but was never inte rviewed.  They would tell me to 
come in the morning, but then the niyaba wouldn't l et me in.  The niyaba finally 
took a statement from me on May 19 and I was examin ed by a forensic doctor on 
May 20."  
 
 Two forensic medical examinations by Ministry of J ustice physicians 
confirmed the injury to Buktur's jaw that was susta ined during his torture.47  After 
the first forensic medical report, Buktur was told by the niyaba, Husam Abdallah of 
the Heliopolis prosecution office, that the investi gation would not proceed until 
there was a final medical report.  The final medica l report in the case, dated 
January 19, 1992, was based on an examination and X -ray by a second physician on 
November 5, 1991.48

     47He was first examined by Dr. Muhammed Atif Mahmoud Sayyid on May 20, 1991, who 
submitted a forensic medical report dated September  5, 1991. The doctor's report noted 
that "two X-rays indicated clearly a fracture in th e left lower jaw."  The doctor also found, 
after his own examination, "a light green bruise, t urning to yellow, of an unspecified shape, 
approximately 5x7 cm in size, on the right cheek .. . swelling in the left cheek ... [and] the 
lower [left] jaw in complete closure because it was  affixed by a metal wire to the teeth of the 
upper jaw."  The doctor concluded that "the injury in the lower jaw resulted from collision 
with a hard object ... at a time perhaps contempora neous with the alleged incident on May 9, 
1991."  The doctor also wrote that "the status of t he injury is not yet stabilized and is not yet 
of a permanent nature.  I recommend re-examination after two months in order to X-ray the 
lower jaw after the wire is removed in order to cla rify the final status of the injury."  Ministry

 "I went to the niyaba at least four or five times, " Buktur told MEW.  "I went 
to the niyaba one month ago [January 1992].  He tol d me to wait until the final 
medical report.  He told me to give him the names o f the men who tortured me.  I 
told him that I could take him to the police statio n and point them out, that I only 
knew the name of the one who came to my shop." Late r, after visiting the 
niyaba on February 16, 1992, Buktur told MEW:  
 
  The niyaba asked me if I could go to the 
police station and identify one of the officers. 
I said yes.  Then the niyaba telephoned the 
police station and asked if someone with that 
name worked there.  The problem is that he 
asked about the criminal investigation 
police, not the SSI.  The niyaba was told that 
there was no officer with this name at the 
police station, and he refused to go with me 
to the police station so I could identify him.49   
 
The niyaba told Buktur to return to the office on F ebruary 17 to receive his own 
copy of the final forensic medical report. Buktur t ook this to mean that the file of 
the case was being closed, since the niyaba had inf ormed him that he would 
receive a copy of the forensic medical report at th e point when a decision was 
made to close the file.   
 
 On May 22, 1992, the Egyptian Organization for Hum an Rights filed a 
written complaint about Buktur's case with the Pros ecutor General.  The complaint 
was given the number 3322 at the Prosecutor General 's office.  To date, EOHR has 
not received an acknowledgement of the complaint or  any information about the 
status of the investigation.

 Egyptian law, particularly the long-standing emerg ency law, grants 
broad powers to the Ministry of Interior and the Mi nistry of Justice to arrest and 
detain without charge for lengthy periods.  The Min istry of Interior currently holds 
scores of individuals in long-term detention withou t charge or trial. They remain 
in custody despite court-ordered releases because s uccessive new detention 
orders have been issued by the Interior Ministry.  Higher State Security Court 
decisions to release detainees are simply not imple mented.  
 
 These detainees include suspected radical Islamist s, some of whom 
have been held at Tora Istikbal Prison from two to three years, and Palestinians in 
Abu Za`bal Liman Prison, some of whom have been hel d there since the early 
months of the Gulf crisis in 1990.   These detentio ns continue despite Interior 
Minister Moussa's pledge after taking office in Jan uary 1990 that he was 
"committed to state policy which believes in the ru le of law" and that "if a court 
orders the release of someone then we must all hono r that order." 
 
 The flouting of judicial rulings by issuing detent ion orders in succession, 
over long periods, after court-ordered releases, cl early violates the fundamental 
human right to be free from arbitrary arrest and th e right to effective remedy 
before competent national tribunals for acts that a bridge fundamental rights.      152 152152152    $$ $$    LL LLONGONGONGONG -- --TT TTERM ERM ERM ERM DD DDETENTIONETENTIONETENTIONETENTION

 Under Egyptian law, several mechanisms can be used  to arrest and 
detain any individual.1  The state's long-standing state of emergency2, most 
recently renewed and approved by the People's Assem bly in May 1991 for three 
additional years, grants the Minister of Interior t he administrative power to order 
the detention of any individual without charge on e xceedingly broad grounds: 
suspicion of endangering public order or security.3  In addition, prosecutors from 
the Ministry of Justice conducting investigations p ursuant to the criminal 
procedure code can petition regular courts for auth ority to hold persons in 
custody for periods up to and, in felony cases, exc eeding six months.

Powers," AI Index: MDE 12/01/89, May 1989, for a de tailed description of the legal basis for 
administrative detention and detention in security- related criminal cases. 
     2The Egyptian Constitution grants the president of t he republic the power to declare a 
state of emergency, pursuant to Law No. 162 of 1958 , the Emergency State Act. Article 148 of 
the Constitution provides: "The President of the Re public shall proclaim a state of 
emergency in the manner prescribed by the law.  Suc h proclamation must be submitted to 
the People's Assembly [the lower elected house of P arliament] within the subsequent 
fifteen days in order that the Assembly may take a decision thereon.  In case the People's 
Assembly is dissolved, the matter shall be submitte d to the new Assembly at its first 
meeting.  In all cases, the proclamation of the state of emer gency shall be for a limited 
period , which may not be extended unless by approval of t he Assembly."  (Emphasis added.)

 The Ministry of Interior maintains daily statistic s on the number of 
inmates in Egyptian prisons, including detainees wh o are held for political, as 
opposed to criminal, reasons.  Ministry officials p resented data to MEW indicating 
that as of February 19, 1992, there were 584 unsent enced political detainees in 
Egyptian prisons, out of a total prison population of 35,321.4   Three months earlier, 
after the arrests at the time of the Middle East pe ace conference in Madrid, 
statistics from the same data base showed that on N ovember 14, 1991, there were 
644 political detainees out of a total prison popul ation of 32,993. 
 
 MEW reviewed Interior Ministry statistics dating b ack to 1989, which 
revealed that the total number of prisoners has inc reased by about fifteen percent 
from March 1989 to February 1992, but that the numb er of political detainees has 
fluctuated between a low of 219 persons in March 19 89 to a high of 1,004 in 
September 1989 (see chart, above).

 MEW found evidence that the Ministry of Interior u ses its considerable 
power under the emergency law to subvert the rule o f law in cases of political 
prisoners held under administrative detention.  Isl amist and Palestinian 
detainees -- some of whom have been held without ch arge since 1990 -- claim that 
they have been continuously detained under successi ve detention orders despite 
court-ordered releases.   
 While Egypt's emergency law affords the Minister o f Interior the right to 
object to a detainee's challenge of his detention o rder before the Higher State 
Security Court, if the detention order is overruled  by two courts, the detainee 
should be released.5  Judicial review is designed to curb the arbitrary  or punitive 
                                                                    
     5Article 3 bis of the Emergency Law provides in part: "The detain ee, and any other persons 
concerned, may lodge a complaint against his arrest  or detention if he is not released 
within 30 days from the date of the said arrest or detention.  Such complaints are 
submitted, without payment of any charges, to the H igher State Security Court constituted 
in accordance with the provisions of this Act.  
 "The Court must hand down a substantiated decision  on the complaint within 15 
days from the date of its submission and after hear ing the statements of the arrested or 
detained person, failing which the latter must be r eleased immediately." 
 Article 3 bis further provides: "If an order is issued for the r elease of the said 
person, or if no decision is taken on the complaint  within the time-limit specified in the 
preceding paragraph, the Minister of Interior may a ppeal against the release order within 
15 days from the date of its issue or from the expi ration of the above-mentioned time limit. 
 "If the Minister of the Interior appeals against t he order, his appeal must be 
referred to another court within 15 days from the d ate of its submission and a decision must 
be taken thereon within 15 days from the date of it s referral; otherwise, the detainee must     L L LLONGONGONGONG -- --TT TTERM ERM ERM ERM DD DDETENTION ETENTION ETENTION ETENTION $$ $$    155155155155    
 
exercise of the powers of arrest and detention. The  flouting of judicial rulings 
through the technique of repeatedly issuing new adm inistrative detention orders 
against targeted individuals is a violation of the fundamental human right to not 
be arbitrarily deprived of one's freedom.  
 
 The day after his appointment as Interior Minister  in January 1990, Gen. 
Muhammed Abdel Halim Moussa pledged in an interview  that he was "committed 
to state policy which believes in the rule of law."6  He was asked during the 
interview about political detainees in Egypt and he  pledged to uphold rulings of 
the judiciary: "We will enforce the law in the sens e that if a court orders the 
release of someone then we must all honor that orde r." 
 
 But long-term political prisoners and Egyptian law yers assert that 
judicial decisions to overturn Ministry of Interior  detention orders are not 
respected.  Detainees who are held long-term despit e judicial orders for their 
release are concentrated in two prisons: the Islami sts in Tora Istikbal, and the 
Palestinians in Abu Za`bal Liman.  Detainees in bot h prisons provided MEW with 
information that after court-ordered releases they are removed from prison, held 
incommunicado in SSI custody, and returned to the p rison after new detention 
orders have been issued. Since they never see freed om after they are ordered 
released, it is unlikely that the new detention ord ers are based on reasons that 
have not already been rejected by the Higher State Security Court.

Cairo.  MEW visited the prison on February 16, 1992 .  Prison authorities reported 
that there were some 400 "political" detainees at T ora Istikbal at the time, out of a 
total prison population of 1,093.  Of the political  detainees, the authorities said 
that 264 occupied cells on the first two floors of the four-story building that MEW 
was permitted to visit briefly.  Virtually all of t he political detainees on these two 
floors were on a hunger strike at the time of MEW's  visit.  The hunger strike was 
cited as one of the reasons by the authorities for curtailing the length and scope

 The striking detainees told MEW that they were bei ng held under 
successive detention orders, without charge, despit e court-ordered releases.  As 
MEW representatives were leaving the building, deta inees handed them 
numerous handwritten notes, which prison officials permitted MEW to keep. One 
anonymous note outlined the detainees' grievances a nd the reasons behind the 
hunger strike, including the problem of long-term d etention without charge or 
trial.  The pertinent part of the document read: 
 
  [We protest] the policy of repeated detention, 
which is even in violation of the emergency 
law, which states that the maximum period a 
detainee can spend in detention, if released 
by the judiciary, is two months.  But the 
Minister of Interior oppresses currently 
about 100 of the Islamic detainees and 
refuses to carry out the successive judicial 
decisions to release them.  Some of these 
people have been detained for more than 
three successive years.7 
 
The document then listed the names of fourteen deta inees at Tora Istikbal held 
continuously without charge for over three years.8   
 
 In March 1992, MEW wrote to Chancellor Raga' el-Ar aby, Egypt's 
Prosecutor General, and provided the names of these  fourteen detainees.  MEW 
requested that the Prosecutor General specify the l ength of time that these 
individuals have been held in uninterrupted detenti on without charge, and to

provide specific information about each case.9  As of the date of the release of this 
report, MEW has not received a reply. 
 
 Some detainees told MEW they had been removed from  Tora Istikbal 
prison after court-ordered releases, held in incomm unicado detention by SSI, and 
then returned to prison after new detention orders were issued.  For example, Ali 
Abd al-Muhammed Khalil was arrested on January 18, 1991.  Since then, he had 
been released eight times by the court but continue d to be detained.  After each 
court-ordered release, he wrote in a short document  provided to MEW, "I was 
transferred from Tora Istikbal to Lazoughly, where I was tortured.  They renew my 
detention from Lazoughly and I spend a period of te n to fifteen days there.  
Following that, each time I am transferred back to Tora Istikbal."  He appealed for 
supervision of his court-ordered releases by the ni yaba, and the recording of 
marks of torture on his body "in the book of the Pr isons Administration upon my 
arrival at the prison."   
 
 In a handwritten statement listing the reasons for  the hunger strike, 
detainees complained in particular about SSI office r Imad al-Najjar, "who takes us 
to SSI and tortures us personally there and here."  In another handwritten 
statement provided to MEW, detainees alleged that t he following SSI officers have 
tortured them at Lazoughly: Gen. Mustafa Abdul Kade r (the director of SSI), Brig. 
Gen. Muhammed el-Said, Maj. Ahmad Kamel, and Maj. M ahmoud Sayyid Sharawi. 
 
 In the limited time the authorities allotted for i nterviews with the 
political detainees at Tora Istikbal, MEW was able to obtain the following 
additional information: 
 
 **  Magdi Gohari Afifi, a twenty-six-year-old acco untant, was one of these 
detainees.  He was visibly weak from the hunger str ike when MEW interviewed him 
in his prison cell. Lying on his mattress, covered with a blanket, he told his story in 
a strained voice.  He was arrested at his home in G iza in July 1990, handcuffed and 
blindfolded, and taken to the SSI building in Giza,  where he was held 
                                                                    
     9MEW asked for the following information about each of the fourteen cases: the original 
date and location of arrest, the legal authority fo r arrest, the date of the expiration of the 
original detention order and the date of release, t he location where release took place, 
dates and locations of successive arrests, and the legal authority for these successive 
arrests, including dates of expiration of detention  orders.     158 158158158    $$ $$    LL LLONGONGONGONG -- --TT TTERM ERM ERM ERM DD DDETENTIONETENTIONETENTIONETENTION     
 
incommunicado for five days.  He said that he was t ortured on the first floor of the 
building with beatings, electricity and suspension.   He was then moved to Tora 
Istikbal. He said that he has never been charged wi th an offense.   
 
 He told MEW that he has been removed from the pris on nine times and 
taken to the Giza SSI building: "I usually stay one  week to ten days.  I am not 
blindfolded or tortured. There are two special room s on the ground floor," he said.  
"No one talks to you."  After each of these repeate d periods of incommunicado 
detention, Gohari has been returned to his cell in Tora Istikbal.10 
 
 **  Another handwritten note provided to MEW repre sentatives listed the 
names of eight detainees, including Gohari, who hav e been held without charge 
since 1990, and one who has been held since April 1 991.11  "There are many," the 
note read, "and those we have mentioned are only as  an illustration. All of these 
men were ordered released by the court."  Between t he time one detention order 
expires and the date of commencement of a new deten tion order, the detainees 
are held in SSI custody, sometimes in Central Secur ity Forces camps in the 
provinces.  The note listed the names of three deta inees who were believed to be 
held in the CSF camp in Giza ( muaskar quat `amn el-Giza ) since January 13, 1992:

 **  As MEW representatives were leaving the prison , they found three 
hunger strikers on stretchers in a large empty room  off a wide corridor.  One of the 
three was Mahmoud Mohammed Ahmad Shayeb, twenty-eig ht, a resident of Assyut 
who holds a B.A. in medicine.  Gen. Mahmoud Fakaran i, the director of the Prisons 
Administration, described Shayeb to MEW with the fo llowing words: "I know him.  
He's the most dangerous person in Assyut."   
 
 Shayeb said that he had started his hunger strike on February 11, five 
days earlier. Visibly exhausted, he told MEW that h e had been examined by a 
doctor and had received saline solution from the in travenous drip next to his 
stretcher.  Although surrounded by prison officials , he responded to a series of 
MEW questions.   
 
 He said that he was arrested on January 13, 1990 i n Assyut and has been 
in continuous detention since this time. Before his  arrest, the security forces 
arrested his wife, Malal Hussein 'Ali, and held her  for three days at the SSI building 
in Assyut.  She was released when he was arrested.  
 
 Shayeb said he was initially held for eight days i n SSI custody in Assyut, 
before being brought to Tora Istikbal prison.  He s aid that over the previous two 
years he had been removed four times from Tora Isti kbal to SSI headquarters in 
Lazoughly.  "They move us at night," he said.  Each  time, he spent two days in 
Lazoughly, where he was stripped naked, threatened with sexual abuse, poked 
with electricity, exposed to the cold, and told he would never see the sun again. "In 
two years, I've been to court twenty-six times and ordered released, but these 
orders were not executed.  I've been told that I'll  never get out because my sister's 
husband is Dr. Omar Abdul Rahman [the now-exiled mi litant blind Egyptian sheik , 
or religious scholar, considered the spiritual lead er of the clandestine Jihad 
Organization]." 
 
 Prior to this chance encounter with Shayeb, striki ng prisoners had told 
MEW that some detainees were being held in a specia l room called "The Hospital," 
on the floor above the prison director's office. ME W was not permitted to visit this 
area on February 16, but received assurances from p rison officials that access to 
these detainees would be provided during MEW's prom ised return visit to Tora 
Istikbal on February 18.  Shayeb was one of the det ainees held in "The Hospital."  
He told MEW:  "Fourteen of us are being held in the  hospital.  Hassan Gharabawi12

 MEW visited Abu Za`bal Liman prison on February 12 , 1992, a facility which 
at that time held 2,463 prisoners.  Prison authorit ies said that all except 119 of the 
inmates were sentenced prisoners serving terms of h ard labor.  Of the 119 
unsentenced prisoners, authorities told MEW that th irteen were held for criminal 
activities and 106 for political activities.  Some 100 of the political detainees were 
Palestinians, many of whom have been held since the  early days of the Gulf crisis 
in 1990.   
 
 MEW was able to interview some of the sixty-six of  these detainees who 
are held together in one cellblock.  They provided information about 
incommunicado detention by SSI prior to their trans fer to prison, torture and ill-
treatment while they were held in SSI custody, and continuous detention, despite 
court-ordered releases.  Some told MEW that they we re held in incommunicado 
detention in SSI custody until new detention orders  were issued.

dates of these orders indicate that there always wa s a gap of between eight and 
ten days between the date one detention ended and t he date the new order was to 
take effect.  His first detention, for example, com menced on December 12, 1990 
and ended on January 19, 1991, but his second deten tion did not take effect until 
January 28, 1991.  He was not released on January 1 9, but moved from the prison 
into SSI custody until the new detention order took  effect.  
 
 He wrote in a document he handed to MEW representa tives that during 
these gaps in detention he was held in SSI custody at Lazoughly until he was 
returned to prison, and that his movements to and f rom Lazoughly were not 
recorded in the prison log. He appealed that his re leases from detention be 
supervised. The dates of the orders indicate that h e had periods of freedom before 
another order was issued, but he stated that he "ha s never been exposed to the 
outside in fourteen months." 
 
 **  Abd al-Nasser Zaher Bilal, a fourth-year stude nt at the University of 
Alexandria, was arrested in September 1990 and said  that he had never been 
charged with a specific offense.  He told MEW that the state security court ordered 
four times that he be released but these orders wer e never executed.  He has been 
held in continuous detention at Abu Za`bal. He has lost sight completely in his 
right eye and believes that he is about to become b lind in his left eye (see Chapter 
Two for additional information). 
 
 **  A group of twenty-seven Palestinians at Abu Za `bal, who said that they 
are wanted by the authorities in the Israeli-occupi ed territories, are demanding 
that Egypt allow them to go to Libya or another Ara b country that will accept them.  
These men surrendered themselves to SSI upon enteri ng Egypt and requested 
political asylum. They have been held in continuous  detention since then, for 
periods ranging between one year and eighteen month s.  
 
 They provided MEW with information stating that th ey have been ordered 
released several times -- some of them five times - - by the state security court but 
in fact they never have been released. They reporte d that they are held in Shobra 
branch of SSI in Cairo until new detention orders a re issued and then they are 
returned to Abu Za`bal.  They claim that there is n o basis or reason for the new 
detention orders, because the facts of their case h ave not changed since the

 **  Khalid Rajab Muhammed Abu Dhahi arrived in Egy pt from the Israeli-
occupied territories on June 20, 1990, and gave him self up to SSI.  Since then, he 
has been held in continuous detention, despite cour t-ordered releases.  Terming 
his releases from detention "imaginary," he claimed  that he was held at the 
Shobra branch of SSI in Cairo after each court orde r and then returned to Abu 
Za`bal prison.  He said that he suffers from cardia c problems and that his health 
has deteriorated during his imprisonment.  His requ ests to be allowed to leave 
Egypt for any Arab state that will accept him have been denied and he appealed for 
assistance in seeking political asylum.

 The transfer police appears to play a key role in the temporary 
"disappearance" of detainees into the hands of SSI,  particularly after detainees 
have been transferred to a prison. This force is pa rt of the security directorate 
(mudiriyyat al-`amn) that exists in each of Egypt's twenty-six governora tes and in 
Cairo.  Prisons Administration officials told MEW t hat the transfer police has the 
responsibility of delivering detainees to prison an d transporting them to their 
governorate of residence after release from prison.    
 
 The director of the Prisons Administration, Gen. M ahmoud Fakarani, was  
formerly head of the security directorate in Assyut  governorate.15  He provided 
MEW with information about the procedures used to r elease detainees or 
prisoners from prison facilities.  "They are releas ed from the province in which 
they reside.  Special forces from the Cairo Securit y Directorate take the prisoner 
to the security directorate in his province. He is released after making an oral 
pledge of good behavior."   
 
 Gen. Fakarani explained that the Cairo Security Di rectorate has its own 
transfer police force, and it is this force which t akes the prisoner from jail to the 
provincial security directorate. The Cairo force pe rforms this function for all 
                                                                    
     15As head of the Assyut security directorate, Gen. Fa karani told MEW that he reported 
directly to the Minister of Interior, "except for m inor administrative matters."

prison releases and transfers, including court-orde red transfers.   
 
 The use of the transfer police allows SSI officers  to avoid acknowledged 
responsibility for detainees after arrest or follow ing release from a prison.  In a 
formal sense, SSI never takes custody of a prisoner .  
 
 MEW learned, for example, that prison records cont ain no information 
about SSI officers or soldiers involved in transpor ting or removing detainees, 
since this function is carried out by the transfer police.  The commander of Tanta 
General Prison told MEW: "The prison records the na me of the head transfer police 
person and the number of the vehicle."16  The commander of Abu Za`bal Liman 
prison told MEW that his prison's log contains info rmation about a prisoner's 
arrival date and the security force delivering the prisoner.  When a prisoner is 
released from a prison, the log notes the name and rank of the officers who 
removed the prisoner and the number of persons in t he force, and the license of 
the vehicle. "We telephone that the car is on its w ay," he said, indicating that this 
is done for security reasons.17 
 
 Further investigation into the complicity of the t ransfer police in SSI 
abuses is clearly necessary.

 Egypt, the second most populous country on the Afr ican continent and a 
pro-Western moderate voice in Middle East politics,  receives over $2.26 billion 
annually in military and economic assistance from t he United States.  Egypt also 
will receive another $721.36 million from the twelv e-nation European Community 
(EC) from 1992 to 1996, under the terms of a five-y ear financial protocol, and the EC 
is Egypt's main trading partner. Despite the levera ge that such aid and trade 
represent, the government of President Hosni Mubara k largely has escaped public 
scrutiny and sustained pressure from the United Sta tes and Europe to improve its 
mediocre human rights record and to lift the long-s tanding state of emergency. 
 
 Although the U.S. State Department in 1992 provide d a frank and 
generally accurate assessment of human rights viola tions in Egypt, Middle East 
Watch is not aware of one instance in 1990, 1991 or  thus far this year when any 
Administration spokesperson publicly made reference  to human rights abuses in 
Egypt or to the need for the Mubarak government to address rights problems.  
 
 In a report to the U.S. Congress justifying aid to  Egypt in fiscal year 1993, 
the U.S. Defense Department states that the aid "en courages Egypt's political and 
economic liberalization" and is designed  to "encou rage further democratic 
reform and improved human rights performance."  But  the Bush Administration 
has never publicly spelled out the nature of the de mocratic reforms its seeks or 
the human rights abuses that must be remedied.  Apa rt from the information 
contained in the annual country report on Egypt, it  has been conspicuously silent 
about the virtual institutionalization of emergency  law and the torture of 
detainees held in custody by State Security Investi gation officers.  In 1991, 
diplomatic sources told The Washington Post that th e U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, 
attempting to curb Kuwaiti government abuses agains t non-Kuwaitis, complained 
to the Kuwaiti government that Egyptian security-fo rce personnel were involved in     166 166166166    $$ $$    SS SSCRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF RR RRECORDECORDECORDECORD     
 
the interrogation and torture of detainees in Kuwai t.1  But the Bush 
Administration's reported protest about Egypt's rol e in human rights abuses in 
Kuwait did not translate into a single public state ment of concern about security 
forces' interrogation and torture of detainees in E gypt. 
 
 Middle East Watch calls on the Bush Administration  and members of the 
European Community to take the lead in building int ernational pressure for an end 
to torture and other human rights abuses in Egypt.  They should publicly 
acknowledge and condemn the use of torture and prol onged detention without 
trial, and direct the attention of the Egyptian gov ernment to the consequences of 
continued violations on economic assistance.

 In its country report on Egypt issued earlier this  year, the U.S. State 
Department concluded that "as a practical matter, t he [Egyptian] people do not 
have a meaningful ability to change the government"  and catalogued a range of 
human rights abuses, noting that "[m]any basic huma n rights continued to be 
abused or significantly restricted."2   Among the specific problems cited were the 
following twelve points, which touch on virtually e very important aspect of 
political, social and private life in this country of over 55 million people: 
 
 *  "the widespread practice of arbitrary detention  without due process" 
and "no reliable statistics on the number of politi cal prisoners." 
 
 *  "torture of some detainees and the authorities'  failure to punish the 
perpetrators."

 *  "little oversight of the Interior Ministry's us e of Emergency Law

 *  "security forces used lethal force against Isla mic extremists, who were 
sometimes armed." 
 
 *  "limitations on judicial independence and due p rocess ... [including] a 
detainee's rearrest, without formal charge, even if  he has been freed by court 
order." 
 
 *  "substantial abridgement, under the Emergency L aw, of the right to 
privacy." 
 
 *  "[b]ooks and works of art may be confiscated or  banned by decree of 
various ministries without a court order." 
 
 *  "substantial restrictions" on freedom of peacef ul assembly and 
association.3 
 
 *  "strikes are illegal" and "the law requiring al l national trade unions to 
join a single federation infringes upon workers' fr eedom of association." 
 
 *  "important restrictions" on freedom of religion , including the 
requirement that "non-Muslims must obtain a preside ntial decree to build or 
repair a place of worship." 
 
 *  "aspects of the law and many traditional practi ces are discriminatory 
against women." 
 
In addition, the State Department noted that human- rights monitoring 
organizations in Egypt lack legal status:  "Since 1 985, the Government has refused 
                                                                    
     3The State Department notes that political pluralism  is discouraged in Egypt:  "The 
Government's licensing power over newspapers, priva te organizations, political parties, 
and even the recognition of a single trade union fe deration discourages political pluralism. 
 New [political] parties must be approved by a gove rnment committee .... To form a party 
without a license is a felony which may be tried be fore the Court of Ethics or a State Security 
Court."  ( Ibid . p. 1383.)     168 168168168    $$ $$    SS SSCRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF RR RRECORDECORDECORDECORD

 Despite this poor human-rights record, Egypt has e arned a secure place 
in U.S. foreign aid programs as a key regional ally  of the United States.  It receives 
over $2.26 billion in direct annual military and ec onomic assistance, making the 
country one of the top four recipients of U.S. fore ign aid -- second to Israel but 
ahead of Turkey and Greece.  In addition, in Decemb er 1990 the U.S. cancelled $6.7 
billion of Egypt's military debt.  
 
 The substantial leverage afforded by this signific ant level of aid has 
never been utilized -- by the Bush Administration o r by the U.S. Congress -- to effect 
specific improvements in Egypt's human rights pract ices or to push for lifting the 
almost-permanent state of emergency.  The justifica tions offered by the State 
Department for U.S. aid to Egypt ignore or downplay  the serious human rights 
violations noted in the department's own annual rep ort. 
 
 The U.S. Defense Department, in its presentation t o the U.S. Congress for 
security assistance for Fiscal Year 1993,5 set forth the considerations underlying 
U.S. policy toward Egypt, of which the Mubarak gove rnment's support for U.S. 
military activities is foremost: 
 
  The United States desires a moderate, stable 
Egypt, linked politically and economically to 
the West.  Since 1980, Egypt has provided 
essential support for the U.S. military 
presence in the Middle East.  The importance

and strength of the bilateral military 
relationship with Egypt was demonstrated 
throughout the Gulf crisis.  Strong Egyptian 
leadership paved the way for active Arab 
participation in the coalition, and over 35,000 
Egyptian forces constituted the third largest 
military contingent.6 
 
The Presentation also notes Egypt's role in the Mid dle East peace process and the 
Bush Administration's arms control plans for the re gion: 
 
  Egypt is our key Arab partner in efforts to 
achieve an Arab-Israeli peace and bolster 
moderate forces in the volatile Middle East.  
Egypt will be our primary regional partner in 
promoting the President's May 29, 1991 
initiative on regional arms control.  [Foreign 
Military Financing] funded military 
acquisitions envisioned in [Fiscal Year 1993] 
and succeeding years will reinforce these 
leadership roles. 
 
Last, the Defense Department's Presentation states that aid to Egypt is designed to 
"promote market-oriented economic development and r eform and encourage 
trade by financing imports of U.S. goods."  It note s that before the Gulf War, Egypt's 
economy "was already suffering from high population  growth, low productivity 
and a crippling debt."  It cites the U.S. cancellat ion in December 1990 of $6.7 
billion in Egypt's military debt, and notes that th is "was followed by agreements 
with Egypt's other major creditors at the Paris Clu b and the Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) states to reduce Egypt's debt."7  
 
 The Presentation mentions human rights abuses in E gypt but in the 
sanguine context that Egypt's rights record is "imp roving" and that the Egyptian

military has not been linked to human rights abuses : 
 
  [W]e remain concerned and regularly 
express our concerns to the Egyptian 
Government about credible reports of torture, 
mistreatment of political detainees and 
criminal suspects, and severe restrictions on 
freedom of religion.  The Egyptian military has 
not been linked to these human rights 
problems.8 
 
At the same time, it notably deletes inaccurate lan guage from the FY 92 
Presentation, which had lauded Egypt's "tradition o f religious tolerance,"  "guided 
democracy," and "increasingly free political partie s."9  Also dropped was the 
claim that "[t]he government continues to use emerg ency law authority to prevent 
terrorism." 
 
 Egypt engages in a pattern of gross human rights v iolations that includes 
torture of detainees and long-term detention withou t charge or trial under 
emergency law.  Yet, the U.S. Defense Department ha s requested over $1.3 billion 
in security assistance, including military training , for Egypt for the fiscal year 
commencing October 1, 1992.  Section 502B of the Fo reign Assistance Act of 1961, 
as amended, prohibits security assistance to any "c ountry the government of 
which engages in a consistent pattern of gross viol ations of internationally 
recognized human rights."  Gross violations are def ined in the statute to include 
"torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment" and 
"prolonged detention without charges and trial." 
 
 The Defense Department's observation that the Egyp tian military is not 
linked to Egypt's human rights problems in no way e xempts the Administration 
from compliance with the requirements of the Foreig n Assistance Act.  Section 
502B does not permit funding to nonabusive elements  of an abusive government, 
but bars all security assistance to any government engaged in a consistent

pattern of gross violations of human rights. 
 
 Although Section 502B allows the Administration, i f it deems it 
necessary to provide aid to an abusive country, to explain to Congress "the 
extraordinary circumstances warranting provision of  such assistance," neither 
the Bush Administration nor any previous Administra tion has submitted such a 
statement to Congress. 
 
 A similar willingness to ignore U.S. human rights law was reflected in the 
affirmative U.S. votes on three World Bank loans to  Egypt in 1991.10  Section 701 of 
the International Financial Institutions Act of 197 7 requires the Administration to  
 
 channel assistance toward countries other than tho se whose 
governments engage in...a pattern of gross violatio ns of 
internationally recognized human rights, such as to rture or 
cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishme nt, 
prolonged detention without charges, or other flagr ant denial of 
life, liberty, and the security of a person. 
 
The Administration is allowed to vote for assistanc e to such a country only if the 
assistance is designed to meet "basic human needs."  Although torture and 
prolonged detention without charge are well-documen ted and long-standing 
abuses in Egypt, the United States voted to approve  all three loans, none of which 
was designated to meet basic human needs.

projects that would improve the nation's infrastruc ture and provide employment during 
economic restructuring. It is intended also to crea te a safety net for displaced Egyptian 
workers, including those returning from Kuwait. The  final loan, for $84 million, supported a 
$285.5 million project to increase Egypt's use of n atural gas resources, freeing more

requirements to Egypt.  Members have not debated th e issue of conditioning aid to 
specific human rights improvements.  While Congress  has vigorously questioned 
the Administration about the recent U.S. rapprochem ent with Syria, questions 
about Egypt have been rare.  In the few cases in wh ich members of Congress have 
posed questions about aid to Egypt, the exchanges h ave been brief.  
 
 For example, on February 24, 1992, Secretary of St ate James Baker was 
questioned about the U.S. write-off of almost $7 bi llion of Egypt's military debt at a 
hearing of the foreign operations subcommittee of t he appropriations committee 
of the House of Representatives.  Congressman Sidne y R. Yates asked what the U.S. 
received in exchange for cancellation of this debt.   "I don't think -- I'm not aware 
that we got anything specific, Mr. Yates," Secretar y Baker replied. "Maybe we did.  I 
mean, I -- nothing jumps out at me," he added.   
 
 Rep. Yates then asked: "Well, was it just a cancel lation out of the blue?"   
Secretary Baker replied: "Yeah.  It was a debt that  had been basically written off on 
our books, and it was a cancellation that didn't co st -- as I understand it -- didn't 
cost the United States budget more than a minor amo unt."  With additional 
questioning, Secretary Baker noted that the Bush Ad ministration had "good 
reasons" for cancelling the debt and that gaining E gypt's support in the coalition 
against Iraq was "a main reason that we supported c ancellation of that debt."11 
 
 Last year, in an rare intervention, Congressman Do n J. Pease raised the 
issue of Egypt's human rights abuses during a debat e of the rule for the Foreign 
Assistance Authorization Bill: 
 
 Egypt is getting $2.1 billion essentially because of a pattern 
stated by President Carter to reward Egypt for its signing a 
peace treaty with Israel.  But it looks to me now, after 11 or 12 
years that this aid...is going to go in perpetuity .... Two dollars for 
Egypt for every $3 for Israel. How can we justify o ne-sixth of our 
total foreign aid each year going to Egypt...when o ther countries 
have similar and more pressing developmental needs,  when 
Egypt was accused just recently by Amnesty Internat ional of 
having a security apparatus that "routinely torture s, beats and

 The Bush Administration has requested that Egypt r eceive a total of 
$2.266 billion in U.S. military and economic aid fo r the fiscal year that commences 
on October 1, 1992 (FY 93).  This includes: 
 
 *  $1.3 billion from the Foreign Military Financin g program (FMF)13; 
 
 *  $1.8 million in International Military Educatio n and Training program 
funds (IMET)14 for technical training and military education for 170 Egyptian 
military officers; 
 
 *  $815 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF)15; and  
                                                                    
     12Remarks made on October 30, 1991, and reported in " For the Record," The Washington 
Post , November 7, 1991. 
     13This assistance is in the form of long-term, low-in terest loans to finance military 
purchases.  The Administration's FY 93 request stat es that the FMF program for Egypt "will 
support M1A1 tank co-production and the F-16 and AH -64 Apache helicopter programs.  The 
M1A1 and F-16 programs will be into their high-cost  phases during FY 93.  Under an 
agreement with General Dynamics and Turkish Aerospa ce Industries, the Peace Vector IV 
aircraft will be assembled in Turkey, a significant  accomplishment in regional cooperation 
between two important U.S. allies." (U.S. Departmen t of Defense Congressional 
Presentation, p. 159) 
     14The International Military Education and Training p rogram, or IMET, was established as a 
separate program in 1976.  It finances the training  of foreign military personnel in the 
United States. The Defense Department FY 93 Congres sional Presentation states that "IMET 
helps integrate advanced U.S. systems into the Egyp tian forces. The training also exposes 
Egyptians to U.S. traditions of democracy, human ri ghts, and civilian control of the 
military....IMET will continue to expose a new gene ration of military leaders to U.S. concepts 
and systems through technical training and professi onal military education."  ( Ibid ., p.159)

 According to the Defense Department's Congressiona l Presentation, the 
proposed level of military and economic assistance from these programs is the 
same as the aid Egypt received in FY 1991 and is ex pected to receive during FY 
1992, which ends on September 30, 1992.  It also no tes that the Foreign Military 
Financing applied to Egypt's commercial military pu rchases in Fiscal Year 1991

 Although the U.S. is the largest bilateral donor t o Egypt, France, Germany, 
Italy and the United Kingdom also provide sizeable amounts of aid.17 In addition, 
Egypt receives multilateral development assistance from the twelve-nation 
European Community (EC). No conditions are placed o n this EC aid with regard to 
the lifting of Egypt's state of emergency or improv ements in human rights. 
 
 In January 1977, Egypt and the EC concluded a coop eration agreement in 
Brussels which provided for economic, trade, financ ial and social cooperation for 
an unlimited period. The agreement included a finan cial and technical 
cooperation protocol scheduled for renewal every fi ve years; each protocol is 
                                                                                                                                                                          
states: "ESF [to Egypt] will continue to provide ec onomic development, budget and balance 
of payment support through project aid, sectoral gr ants and the commodity import 
program.  In conjunction with a new sector grant ap proach, support for programs in five 
sectors will be linked to progress on policy reform s in those areas." ( Ibid .,  
p. 159) 
     16This assistance -- known as P.L. 480 -- is provided  through a U.S. agency called the 
Commodities Credit Corporation. The Commodities Cre dit Corporation is authorized, 
through the Agricultural Trade Development and Assi stance Act of 1954 (known as "P.L. 
480") to provide food assistance abroad through low -interest loans for purchasing of U.S. 
agricultural products, through concessional sales, and through loan forgiveness programs.

based on priorities jointly agreed to by Egypt and the Community.  Unlike the EC's 
more recent cooperation agreements with Latin Ameri can countries, such as the 
1990 accords with Argentina and Chile which state t hat cooperative ties are 
based on mutual respect for democratic principles a nd human rights, the earlier 
agreements, such as the one executed with Egypt in 1977, do not contain human-
rights language. 
 
 The European Community's assistance to Egypt under  the successive 
financial protocols has steadily expanded.  Egypt's  main trading partner is the 
European Community.  Egyptian exports include oil a nd natural gas, and 
manufactured goods.  Egyptian imports from the Comm unity include machinery 
and transportation equipment, chemicals and manufac tured goods.  
 
 The first protocol, from 1977 to 1981, provided Eu ropean Currency Unit 
(ECU) 170 million,18  most of it earmarked for energy and infrastructur e projects.  
The second protocol, which expired in 1986, provide d ECU 276 million in funding, 
mostly for agricultural and industrial project fina ncing. 
 
 The third protocol, from 1986 to 1991, totalled EC U 449 million, and was 
"intended to contribute to the economic and social development of Egypt."  
According to the document executed in Brussels in D ecember 1987, the 
assistance consisted of ECU 249 million in subsidiz ed-interest-rate loans from the 
European Investment Bank; ECU 189 million in grants  from the Community's 
budget resources; and ECU 11 million in contributio ns to risk-capital formation 
from the Community's budget resources. 
 
 The protocol states that priority projects include  agricultural sector 
development, job-generating industrial and service sector development, science 
and technology research and training, and export di versification and promotion. 
 
 In April 1991, the Egyptian ambassador in Brussels  and the director of the 
European Commission initialled the fourth protocol,  which will run from 1992 to 
1996.  The protocol provides for ECU 568 million, a n increase of twenty-seven 
percent over the third protocol.  It includes ECU 2 58 million in grants from the 
Community's budgetary funds (with 16 million for eq uity capital) and ECU 310

million in subsidized loans from the European Inves tment Bank.19  The protocol 
was approved by the European Parliament on January 15, 1992 in Strasbourg, along 
with protocols on financial and technical cooperati on between the EC and Algeria, 
Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Israel.  Notably, at t he same session the European 
Parliament blocked the renewal of EC financial prot ocols with Syria (worth ECU 
158 million, an increase of about eight percent) an d Morocco (ECU 538 million, an 
increase of over thirty-five percent) because of "s erious concern" about human 
rights violations.20  As of the date of the publication of this report,  assistance to 
both states remains blocked. 
 
 In a separate initiative in October 1990, the Euro pean Community 
decided to provide special financial assistance to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey 
because of the effect of the Gulf crisis on these t hree countries. A total of ECU 600 
million, mostly in grants, was provided from the Co mmunity budget.  Members 
states voluntarily contributed an additional ECU 1, 000 million.  An EC memorandum 
dated December 1991 states: "Of the ECU 600 million , 175 million have already 
been committed by the Community as grants to assist  Egypt's balance of 
payments."

 International financial institutions likewise have  not conditioned their 
substantial assistance to Egypt on human-rights imp rovements, despite the 
imposition of such requirements on two other Africa n countries, Kenya and 
Malawi, in 1991 and 1992.   
   
 At the beginning of 1991, Egypt was burdened with over $55 billion in 
foreign debt to governments, commercial banks and p rivate institutions, with

     20Morocco's foreign minister, Abd al-Latif Filali, re acted to the negative vote by 
discounting the importance of EC aid.  "Morocco doe s not need this protocol and will get by 
without it," he said.  (Shada Islam, "No to Morocco  and Syria," Middle East International , 
January 24, 1992, p. 13.)  According to an EC offic ial interviewed by MEW, there was no public 
reaction from Syrian officials.     S S SSCRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF CRUTINY OF RR RRECORD ECORD ECORD ECORD $$ $$    177177177177    
 
approximately $12 billion owed to the United States . But by the end of the year, the 
situation had changed dramatically. Africa Confidential  reported in early 1992 
that "Egypt gained more from the Gulf war than perh aps any other country." 21  A 
pre-war foreign debt of $50 billion was whittled do wn to $27 billion by generous 
write-offs from creditors, including $14 billion in  debt forgiveness from the U.S. 
and pro-Western Gulf states.22 
 
 In November 1990, the "Paris Club" consortium of c reditor nations 
rejected an Egyptian request to refinance its debt,  demanding prior 
"liberalization" of Egypt's economy. In December 19 90, however, one month before 
the start of the Gulf war, the United States wrote off Egypt's $6.7 billion debt for 
foreign military sales.23  The balance of Egypt's debt to the United States,  some $5 
billion, is authorized to be paid over twenty years  on favorable terms that include a 
four-year grace period and a heavily subsidized int erest rate.24 The U.S. action 
appeared to be a reward for Egypt's role during the  Gulf crisis and its "Thousand-

     23The decision was made by the Bush Administration mo nths earlier. The Washington 
Post  reported that President Bush, after  a National Se curity Council meeting on August 29, 
approved the write-off of $7.1 billion of Egypt's m ilitary debt to the United States. 
Administration officials told the Post  that the president's move was based on Egypt's 
support for U.S. policy in the Gulf crisis. Accordi ng to the Post , following the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait, Egypt extended to the United States overfli ght rights and staging and transit rights 
from Egyptian air bases, and smoothed the passage o f dozens of U.S. warships through the 
Suez Canal. Patrick Tyler, "Bush to forgive $7.1 Bi llion Egypt Owes for Military Aid," The 
Washington Post , September 1, 1990.  Although the amount of the wr ite-off was reported at 
the time as $7.1 billion, the U.S. Defense Departme nt stated in 1992 that in December 1990 
the U.S. forgave $6.7 billion in Foreign Military S ales debt. (FY 1993 Request, p. 158.)

debt will be repaid over 20 years, following an imm ediate four-year grace period, at an 
interest rate not to exceed 2.8 percent .... Egypt' s debt to the United States totalled $12

Day Plan," announced in late 1990, to liberalize it s largely centralized economy. 
The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) joine d the U.S. action, writing off 
over $7 billion of additional debt.25 Later, after Egypt agreed to implement an IMF 
economic program, the Paris Club agreed to forgive up to half of the $20.2 billion 
that Egypt owed its member nations.  
 
 This massive economic assistance was not condition ed on the lifting of 
emergency law or remedying human rights abuses, and  Egyptian officials publicly 
heralded such aid as a boost to the country's inter national status.  For example, 
Prime Minister `Atif Sidqi delivered the government 's policy statement to 
Parliament on December 30, 1991.  He cited Presiden t Mubarak's "realistic 
approach" to foreign policy and Egypt's participati on in the military coalition 
against Iraq, and then noted Egypt's growing intern ational stature: 
 
  Egypt's policies have gained considerable 
international recognition.  An international 
consensus on granting Egypt the assistance 
it needs to overcome its economic crisis 
culminated in an agreement with the World 
Bank and the IMF, an agreement which 
underlines the basic soundness of the 
Egyptian economy.  The agreement abolished 
67 billion Egyptian pounds [approximately 
$20.3 billion] of Egyptian debts to creditor 
countries and rescheduled most of the 
remaining debts on easier terms.26 
 
 President Mubarak made a similar point in a meetin g on May 24, 1992, in 
Assyut, a city in Upper Egypt.  He noted "the need for stability in Egypt...[and] 
asserted that world countries stand by and support stable states."27  He stressed

that "strong and firm relations link Egypt with the  outside world -- be it the 
European countries, the United States, or the commo nwealth countries" and said 
that "one of the results of these relations, out of  appreciation for Egypt's position

the United States and a large part of its civilian debts in accordance with the 
agreement signed with international financial insti tutions."28

 Particularly given the value that the Egyptian gov ernment places on the 
international assistance it receives,  MEW believes  that the World Bank and donor 
nations should impose specific human-rights conditi ons on Egypt's continued 
receipt of generous financial assistance.  There no w are two precedents in Africa 
for such a stance.   
 
 Last year, in a rare move, donor nations pressed K enya to improve human 
rights, and institute political and economic reform s, or face the possibility of 
slashes in Western aid.  On November 26, 1991, in a  communique issued from 
Paris, the United States and eleven other countries , including Britain, France, 
Germany and Japan, issued a warning to Kenya and "c alled for respect for human 
rights and backed opposition demands for greater pl uralism in the one-party 
state."29  A member of the U.S. delegation, John R. Westley,  the head of the Nairobi 
office of the U.S. Agency for International Develop ment, said: "I don't think it's ever 
happened before -- no performance, no money in cert ain areas."30  Callisto 
Madavo, director of the Eastern Africa department o f the World Bank, said: "The 
donors are not walking away from Kenya.  What the d onors are saying is that a 
number of areas must be addressed."

 More recently, the World Bank and major donor nati ons31 suspended 
development assistance to Malawi in southern Africa  because of human-rights 
concerns.  The aid was frozen on May 13, 1992.  In a statement, the World Bank and 
the donors called for "tangible and irreversible ev idence of a basic 
transformation" of the government's record with hum an rights and basic 
freedoms, and a review of the situation after six m onths to see if changes had 
occurred.32  A World Bank officer in southern Africa noted tha t $74 million in aid for 
1992-93 had been rejected, although previously appr oved or in-progress projects, 
totalling $270 million, would not be affected.33

changes against an accused to the full session of t he criminal

often translated as `attorney general', `district a ttorney,' or 
`prosecuting attorney,' but these are misappellatio ns.  The

Muhammed Afifi Mattar, the prominent Egyptian poet who was awarded the State 
Poetry Prize in 1989, was held in detention from th e early morning hours of March 
2, 1991, until May 12, 1991.  He spent the first te n days after his arrest at SSI 
headquarters in Lazoughly, where he was tortured wh ile continuously blindfolded. 
 He was then fifty-five years old.   
 
After his release, Mattar wrote the following accou nt of his torture at Lazoughly: 
 
 
    A S A SA SA S TATEMENT AND A TATEMENT AND A TATEMENT AND A TATEMENT AND A RR RRELEASEELEASEELEASEELEASE  
 
 At 2:30 after midnight on March 2, 1991, a force a rmed with machine guns, 
clubs and shields raided my house and bedroom in th e village of Ramlet al-Anjab, 
Ashmon Center, in al-Amnoufiyya Province.  Individu als of that force, under the 
leadership of officers in military uniforms and pla inclothes, carried out a 
thorough search of my residence, books and personal  papers, without presenting 
a warrant from the niyaba or the judicial authoriti es, or specifying the purpose of 
this frightening armed attack.  Following the searc h, I was taken, my hands cuffed, 
to a transfer vehicle, between two rows of soldiers  who were standing ready to 
shoot.  The transfer vehicle, which was surrounded by the vehicles of guards and 
officers, started off without my knowing where or t o which place of detention I 
ultimately was going.   
 
 I remained in Shebien al-Kum police detention cent er until midday on 
March 2.  After the such routine police procedures as photographing, 
fingerprinting and taking statements, I was moved t o the transfer vehicle, which 
hurriedly brought me and surrendered me to official s at the State Security 
Investigation building at Lazoughly Circle in Cairo , where immediately I was 
subjected to methods and practices of torture and i nhumane treatment, 
frightening and harassing me by means and methods w hich can be summarized 
as follows: 
 
1.  The use of modern metal handcuffs which tighten  around the wrist with minimal 
movements of the hand.  This transforms the hands, arms and shoulders into an 
interlocking mass of numbness and anesthetizes the nerves. Sensation is lost in     184 184184184    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX AA AA    
 
deadly gradual steps over a period of ten days, the  period of my subjection to 
torture at State Security headquarters in Lazoughly . 
 
2.  Covering the ears and the eyes with a thick, pr essuring blindfold, which was 
never removed or altered, resulting in the collecti ng and hardening of blood under 
the eyelids like small pieces of broken glass, maki ng the spontaneous movement 
of the eyes one of severe pain.  The tie also infla med the flesh of the ears as they 
were pressed strongly against the head.  The knot o f the blindfold pressured the 
skull from the back, a pressure that deadens sensat ion in the skin.  As a result of 
beating and the sudden throwing of the body flat on  the floor, the knot of the 
blindfold sank slowly, slowly, inside the skin of t he head. This resulted in a deep 
wound in the back of my head, big enough to insert two fingers inside.  This wound 
continued to bleed and ooze for more than a month a nd a half until it healed.  It left 
a scar which still can be seen and felt.  All this caused disorientation and severe 
weakness in the sight of my right eye. 
 
3.  Forcing me to take an unknown medicine -- "two tablets" -- more than once, 
which caused me severe disturbance and audio-visual  disorientation. It caused 
me to lose awareness of time and place and to be su rrounded by very unpleasant 
nightmares.  While blindfolded, I imagined seeing a nd hearing my family, my 
children and my friends around me, watching my tort ure, the degradation of my 
humanity, the threats of death, and the violations of my honor. I think the effect of 
the medicine which I was forced to swallow is very carefully and accurately 
calculated and measured in order to conquer the wil l and judgment ... and destroy 
the structure of the mind and personality. 
 
4.  Hanging me like a slaughtered animal for long p eriods of time by my cuffed 
hands, and placing a bond which squeezed my feet to gether so I could not use 
them for standing or moving.  This concentrated the  weight of my entire body on 
my wrists, which were attached to a high object I c ould not identify.  All this was 
accompanied by beating with sticks and other implem ents I could not identify.  My 
body was tossed during this time, and I was threate ned with the insertion of a 
stick between my thighs.  This crushed me with pain  and panic. 
 
5.  Putting my two hands in an electric-shock machi ne, which made me howl like a 
wounded wolf and disoriented me, burning me with pa in and thirst from the 
jerking of the electric current through my organs.  Until now, my fingers and the 
top of my hand remain largely without sensation. 
 
6.  Taking off my clothes and making me stand naked  in front of severely cold air     A A AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX A A A A $$ $$    185185185185    
 
currents for a long interval  -- the only thing whi ch saved me was falling into an 
unconscious state. 
 
7.  Subjecting me to a large number of "meals" of c omprehensive, crushing 
beatings, coming at me from all directions with a t errifying, fast rhythm, crushing 
my jaws and face with rapid and precise blows.  Thi s left my entire body colored 
with lines and wide blue bloody splotches and an in jury exposing the bones of my 
nose.  These marks are still visible -- evidence an d proof of the status of the 
intellectual poet and the strength of the authoriti es in our time. 
 
8.  The exposure for long periods to starvation and  deprivation of the necessities 
of life, within the limits of the minimum needs for  sustaining life, ignoring 
sickness, medicine or blankets, and making the proc ess of relieving oneself a way 
of degrading dignity, insulting and exhausting the remnants of individual human 
feelings.   
 
In words and descriptions, as far as language is co ncerned, this is the abbreviated 
panorama of ten days of continuous torture.  But it  is an experience that cannot be 
conveyed as far as endurance and personal suffering  is concerned -- in this 
respect it is an unforgettable lifetime agony of da rkness and the apprehension of 
being alone in front of the powerful.   
 
After these ten days, I was transferred on March 12  to Tora Istikbal prison, Cell No. 
29B, until I was released on May 12, 1991, without standing one moment before the 
niyaba or the authorities for accusation and invest igation or directing any charge 
against me or hearing my defense. 
 
 
 
Therefore: 
 I present this statement as a communique to all th e bodies and 
institutions entrusted -- morally, ethically and fi nancially -- with the honor of 
sacred duty to defend justice, human rights, the di gnity of social harmony 
connecting the citizen with the homeland, and the v alues of all the charters which 
govern his affiliation to his humanity in the world . I demand of these bodies and 
institutions to undertake the legal, ethical, moral  and financial steps which 
guarantee a defence of the essence of my existence and my rights and push back 
this aggression and my torture, until injustice and  darkness diminish from my 
country and my rights in it.  I appeal to all the c ommittees for the defense of 
human rights and liberties in syndicates, parties, associations, newspapers,     186 186186186    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX AA AA    
 
among lawyers, and to opinionated prominent individ uals, to consider that this 
communique is presented to each one of them individ ually as a personal 
responsibility and trust, with the obligation to ac t accordingly.  God is all knowing.

    A PERSONAL STATEMENT A PERSONAL STATEMENTA PERSONAL STATEMENTA PERSONAL STATEMENT    
    BY DR. MUHAMMED MUSTAFA MANDOUR BY DR. MUHAMMED MUSTAFA MANDOURBY DR. MUHAMMED MUSTAFA MANDOURBY DR. MUHAMMED MUSTAFA MANDOUR    
    
    
 Dr. Muhammed Mandour, an Egyptian medical doctor a nd psychiatrist, 
was administratively detained by the Egyptian secur ity authorities for sixteen 
days in February 1991. He was brought from his home  after midnight to State 
Security Intelligence headquarters at Lazoughly, Ca iro. He was held there for 
ten days, from the early morning hours of February 8 until the morning of 
February 17. He was never charged with an offense. 
 
 After his release from detention, Dr. Mandour, who  has served since 
1989 on the Board of Trustees of the Egyptian Organ ization for Human Rights, 
prepared a report for EOHR about his torture and mi streatment at Lazoughly by 
SSI officers and guards.  He never saw these indivi duals because he was 
continuously blindfolded from the moment he entered  the intelligence 
headquarters until the end of his ordeal. 
 
 Dr. Mandour was never examined for signs of tortur e by state forensic 
doctors, despite repeated requests.  The Egyptian g overnment claims that Dr. 
Mandour's allegations of torture are unfounded.  Of ficial legal complaints about 
his torture submitted to the authorities by Egyptia n lawyers have gone 
unanswered, as has Middle East Watch's February 199 1 letter to Egyptian 
President Mubarak requesting information about the investigation of the 
allegations.  
 
 Dr. Mandour was born in 1948 in Cairo and graduate d from Ain Shams 
University Faculty of Medicine in 1973.  He is the director of the psychiatric unit 
of Palestine Hospital in Cairo, which is owned by t he Palestinian Red Crescent 
Society.  He has been a member of the Egyptian Orga nization for Human Rights 
since 1985.    
         
 
 Before midnight on February 7, 1991 ... I was chat ting with a physician 
and a colleague in my house ... There was no one el se in the house except my 76-
year-old mother.  My mother opened the door and was  surprised by a number of 
strange men, two of them in plainclothes and a numb er in police military 
fatigues ... The leader of the two in plainclothes introduced himself with utmost 
politeness as Lt. Col. 'Ali Abdul Fattah of State S ecurity Intelligence.  After the     188 188188188    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX BB BB    
 
search, he asked me to accompany him ... I asked hi m: Is it merely a summons to 
the State Security or a detention?  He told me it i s a detention and I can bring 
some clothes I asked: Is there a prosecution warran t?  He said no and that I will 
be detained on the basis of a detention order.  Bot h of the intelligence officers 
presented themselves in a calm manner and carried o ut a thorough search 
without damaging anything or any disturbance of my elderly mother.  He put all 
the papers which he gathered from my office in fron t of me in a large envelope 
and, truthfully, he was honest, he was even kind, t o the extent that I thanked him 
after we left the house, despite my absolute astoni shment about the 
circumstances and the reasons for my sudden detenti on. 
 
 On the way, the officer from Central Security put me between him and 
the driver in the cabin of a huge Central Security lorry in which there were 
policemen ... He also was extremely polite, lit a c igarette for me and apologized 
profusely about seeing me in this situation ... Bef ore our arrival at the 
intelligence building in Lazoughly,  he told me wit h profuse apology on Shaikh 
Rihan Street that I must be blindfolded before we e ntered the building ... He 
stopped and brought my suitcase, took a T-shirt out  of it and, again politely, he 
asked me to tie it around my eyes. 
 
 I entered the intelligence building blindfolded an d climbed a few steps 
to the left, holding my suitcase.  I stopped for a moment and then someone 
pulled me to enter a narrow metal place, which I im mediately recognized as an 
elevator when it went up a few flights. 
 
 After we left the elevator, I was taken into a roo m in which the senior 
intelligence officer who had arrested me was waitin g. (In front of the house, he 
and the young intelligence officer had left before us in a civilian Volkswagen 
car.)  He told me calmly and kindly that I would sl eep there that night, and he 
took personal belongings from me, including my watc h, pens, money and my 
identification card ... and he told me that we will  meet after the end of the 
detention ... He asked if I needed anything and he wished me a good night.  
Immediately after the officer left, modern metal ha ndcuffs were put on my 
hands and the guard exchanged my own blindfold for a special blindfold of 
which they have a lot.  Its color is black and it h as more than one layer of cloth, 
wide in the middle, and it can be pulled from the e nds to become relatively 
narrow.

 Following this, he led me to some place on the sam e floor after we 
passed something like a lobby.  He opened a door an d took me in.  My foot 
bumped part of a body on the floor; it seemed like a foot.  The guard said calmly: 
Watch out.  Then I found myself leaning against a w all ... He told me: Sleep and 
relax here until the morning.  I asked him: Aren't you going to take off my 
handcuffs, since I am in 
a secure place?  He 
said: No, they won't be 
removed until your 
departure and only 
when you go to the 
bathroom.  I asked him 
about the blindfold and 
he said: Not until your 
departure from this floor.  For your own good, he p leaded with me, please don't 
speak a lot.  I asked him finally about a blanket s ince it was very cold.  The guard 
was immediately sympathetic and said: You are a res pectable person.  Why are 
you here?  I replied: Aren't others who come here a lso respectable? ... He then 
stopped talking entirely and told me not to speak a t all, that speaking is 
absolutely forbidden ... I stretched out on the flo or and noticed after a few 
minutes an injured person stretched out on the damp  wooden floor, most likely 
the same one I had bumped into, and a very thick bl anket which could cover my 
legs slightly below the knee. 
 
 Moments before I had spoken to him, the guard had said that the 
officer left the sandwiches for me that my mother h ad given to him ... I thanked 
the guard but said I had no appetite for food.  Aft er I stretched out on the floor, I 
tried to put my hands behind my head as a pillow bu t I was unsuccessful.  In 
fact, this movement increased the pressure of the l eft metal handcuff ... I 
realized with the passage of time that this kind of  handcuff has teeth and 
whenever you make a move the teeth become tighter a nd tighter ... As days went 
by, this caused pressure and affected the sensation  in my left thumb, 
accompanied by pain in both hands.  I didn't sleep much during the night 
because I kept thinking about the meaning of this.  If the matter was merely 
detention for this night, then why the handcuffs an d blindfold?  At most I slept 
for an hour or so ... The next morning, Friday, Feb ruary 8, 1991, the day began with 
distribution of breakfast, which was the same as ev ery other meal every day ... a 
loaf of [Arabic] bread and two pieces of ta'miyya  [fried ground fava beans].  
During the ten days, this meal changed once, and th at was kushari  [rice and 
lentils] inside the bread instead of ta'miyya  ... Twice, one tomato had been The guard said: You are a respectable person.  
Why are you here?   
I replied: Aren't others who come here also 
respectable?       190 190190190    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX BB BB    
 
added to the ta'miyya  ... Friday morning I also had no appetite to eat . .. The guard 
came to take me ... I walked with him blindly and a fter a few steps he opened a 
door and I was told: Doctor ... sit. 
 
 A person with a loud voice with a severe tone, ful l of self confidence.  
The content of his long lecture focused on examples  of the most difficult cases 
(the attempted assassination of Zaki Badr,1 the assassination of Mahgoub2), and 
how in the same chair the suspects confessed in fro nt of the minister in the first 
case and after two hours in the case of Mahgoub.  S ince the person under 
torture confessed in detail to a meeting the next d ay with his accomplices in 
the assassination, this enabled the police to arres t three and kill two. Although 
it was possible to 
arrest them, the 
apparatus already had 
decided that they were 
hopeless cases 
because they had 
already been accused 
several times but never 
gave up.  He also 
emphasized in his 
speech that I am here 
under his complete 
control and there is no authority in Egypt that can  interfere with what may 
happen to me, particularly since a notification had  been sent out that I had 
escaped during my arrest and they had covered thems elves with an arrest 
warrant notifying police stations, police lookouts,  ports and airports ... 
Therefore if I became stubborn -- and I will not be  able to -- it is possible that I 
will be killed here and my body taken away in a clo sed police car that no one 
will stop on the way. He told me that he took advan tage of the existence of 
detention orders to include me ... in order to have  me alone here and extract 
everything he wants.

associate of President Mubarak from the ruling Nati onal Democratic Party, was 
assassinated in Cairo on October 12, 1990 --MEW. He emphasized that I am here under his 
complete control and there is no authority in 
Egypt that can interfere with what may happen 
to me. If I became stubborn, I will be killed here 
and my body taken away in a closed police car 
...      A A AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX B B B B $$ $$    191191191191    
 
 
 Following that, he went on to tell me that my dete ntion order was not 
yet signed and I can go home this evening (Friday),  or the next morning at most, 
if I speak frankly and voluntarily, and give them e verything I know sincerely, and 
that I have nothing to fear regardless of the degre e of my own involvement. In 
short, if I help him, he will help me ... and, if I  wish, he will leave it up to me to 
choose if I want to collaborate with them permanent ly -- although they do not 
pay much, they are very discreet. 
 
 He started his questioning by saying: Who are you?   I told him my 
name, my profession and the areas of my activities ... He mocked me and said: 
Who are you?  I kept saying the same thing.  Then h e started to repeat his 
threats and began to explain to me the specialty of  torture, which will make me 
say everything after being in a debilitated state, although it is more respectable 
to confess without torture.  During this speech, wh ile explaining, he started to 
put his hand on my leg and shoulders violently, acc ompanied by some vulgar 
words about my family ... An extremely calm, older voice interrupted (the first 
one told him "Hey, pasha") and advised me not to de grade myself and not to be 
clever. They would give me an opportunity to think.  He also warned me against 
any lying and warned that if I stopped eating they would torture me ... because I 
have to eat in order to endure torture!  The securi ty man was called and the 
younger officer with the loud voice told him: Beat him so that his brain work`s 
good.   
 
 I started to grope. I was asked to lift my arms al l the way up and they 
were tightened to a metal bar ... my feet barely to uched the floor, but the weight 
of my body was still carried by my feet.  I thought  that the next day I would be 
lifted up ... but I realized that this was the pref erred hanging in my case ... I 
thanked God for that ... 
although I discovered 
its cruelty by enduring 
it for long hours ... After 
several hours on Friday 
-- after the calling for 
the fourth prayer -- the 
officer called for me 
another time and asked 
me if I wanted to speak 
voluntarily.  I told him I 
will say what I know, The security man was called and the younger 
officer told him: Beat him so that his brain 
works good.... 
I was asked to lift my arms all the way up and 
they were tightened to a metal bar.  My feet 
barely touched the floor but the weight of my 
body was still carried by my feet.  I continued 
to hang, standing, the entire night ....       192 192192192    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX BB BB    
 
and how nice it would be if he had specific questio ns so I could answer clearly 
and at length.  Then he asked the guard to continue  hanging me in front of an air 
current until the next day ... and they did this an d I continued to hang, standing, 
the entire night until the second call for prayers on Saturday, February 9, 1991. 
During the "standing," the guard told me that my ha ndcuffs would be taken off 
for a few minutes if I ate.  I told him I hope you do that but I cannot eat because I 
almost want to vomit, and my desire to eat had disa ppeared. 
 
 Following the above-mentioned call for prayers on Saturday, my hands 
finally were brought down.  Although I was fully cl othed, my body was shivering 
from the cold for several hours at the end of the n ight and during the early hours 
of the morning.  I had a profound desire merely to sit ... 
 
 I was taken to the always-threatening officer with  the loud voice and 
he said: Hey, Mandour, has your brain softened? I a sked him: Why?  What's 
going on, sir?  ... I was surprised by a series of successive violent slaps on the 
face and neck, which I could not count, some of whi ch were accompanied by 
"lightning" in my left 
eye.  The same voice 
told me only several 
words as it came 
closer: You are a 
physician and you 
know that we'll make you lose your sight. 
 
 The beating stopped for a while and I was standing  ... Then a series of 
vulgarities started, which I had rarely heard, desp ite my contact with different 
social classes. These vulgarities were not merely a bominable but were meant 
to degrade the person to whom they were directed an d to conquer him 
psychologically if he didn't reply.  I instantly fe lt extremely insulted and did not 
know what to do in this situation.  But he was fast er than me with one phrase: 
Take off his clothes.  The guard took me a few step s outside the room after a 
door was opened between us.  They took off my suit,  which I was wearing when I 
was arrested, my tie, my shirt, my pullover and my undershirts (and I had three 
of them because of the cold), my shoes, my socks.  They left me only with my 
underpants and took me another time through the doo r to stand in front of the 
officer after they removed my metal handcuffs and e xchanged them for a strong 
cloth used to tie my hands behind my back.  I was s urprised by the officer telling 
me that I am a lowly animal and that he will punish  me with electricity, which I 
deserve ... and immediately I found myself jumping two steps back from merely "Hey, Mandour, has your brain softened?"       A A AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX B B B B $$ $$    193193193193    
 
being touched by an electrical tool on my shoulder.   He repeated it several 
times. I jumped every time, and anger was rising in side me ... because I did not 
imagine, despite the slaps I had received, which we re the first slaps in my life, 
that they would carry my physical mistreatment furt her, particularly given my 
professional scientific position, my clearly known public activities, and the fact 
that they did not specify an accusation against me ...........    
 
 After several shocks ... the barbaric officer scre amed and said: Bring 
him in. They accompanied me several steps through a  door and I found myself 
in a place with a soft layer of thick foam on the f loor ... They also tied the soles of 
my feet with  strong fabric. Then one of them kicke d me on the soles of my feet. I 
immediately found myself lying on my back and my ha nds behind me ... They put 
something metal that pried open my legs from the kn ees and fixed them in that 
position ... then I found 
metal bars being 
pushed in between my 
arms and my torso and 
I recognized that these 
were sophisticated 
bars very close to the 
area of my chest but 
without touching it ... 
Then I felt the very loud 
sound of the barbaric officer and the waves of his voice on my face when he 
turns to me and says: I will ride you, (you ***).3  He started to apply the electrical 
machine at continuous intervals to my shoulders in circles and in 
perpendicular lines for a distance of centimeters - - and not just a touch.  There 
was no chance of jumping.  But my poor body was jer king and it almost wanted 
to break all the restraints but in vain ... He move d on to the nipples of my chest, 
then the abdomen, then the navel, then the inside o f the thighs and sometimes 
he travels up and down.  Then he yelled: Take off h is cloth [underpants].  Then he 
started very precisely with this machine on the scr otum, then on the shaft of the 
penis and its head and its opening ... At that mome nt I was jerking and my head 
moved up to its maximum position.  When my head was  going up, in front of my 
mouth was a metal bar -- I didn't know where it cam e from -- but I was biting it 
                                                                    
     3This expression in Arabic also can be used in a vul gar manner to mean sexual 
intercourse --MEW. I found myself jumping two steps back from 
merely being touched by an electrical tool on 
my shoulder.  He repeated it several times. I 
jumped every time, and anger was rising inside 
me ...       194 194194194    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX BB BB    
 
without feeling any pain from this biting except in  the following days.  And, 
sadly, I was convulsing like a slaughtered animal . .. I said a few words, of which I 
recall: Are you treating a dog?  And his answer was  extremely degrading ...  
 
 
 And another: 
Isn't this enough? 
 
 The electricity 
stopped immediately, 
and he told me: Oh, you 
are rational ... Your 
status doesn't allow 
you to degrade yourself 
(as if I am the one who 
degraded it!).  He said 
that he is sad and that he is obliged (!) to do wha t he did to me ... and he ordered 
the security to put on half of my clothes (pants, s hirt, shoes) to start the 
investigation. (Throughout my 10 days, the policeme n in this building, or at least 
on this floor, were called security because you do not hear the name of any 
officer or any policeman, although you can distingu ish the kind of relations 
between the first and the second.) 
 
 Finally the investigation started ... I was asked to speak about my 
public activities, which means June 8, 1967, when p olice cars roamed the 
quarter where I was living, calling through loudspe akers to every capable youth 
to volunteer for the defense of the country and to gather at Nadi as-Shams in 
Heliopolis ...  
 
 Month after month, year after year, in a way which  makes resentment 
dominate the individual and makes him wish to get r id of the deep degradation 
because of the personal surrender in narrating life  stories while blindfolded 
and handcuffed, without being able to reply to accu sations ... We finished at a 
late hour of the next morning, Sunday, February 10,  on the condition that it would 
be continued the next day ... My psychological stat e was very bad and I felt 
profoundly degraded, 
to the point where for 
an hour I thought of 
suicide but I did not 
even find any He started to apply the electrical machine at 
continuous intervals to my shoulders in circles 
and in perpendicular lines .... He moved on to 
the nipples of my chest, then the abdomen, 
then the navel, then the inside of the thighs .... 
Then he started very precisely with this 
machine on the scrotum, then on the shaft of 
the penis and its head and its opening.   
I was shocked by his screaming and beating 
me violently with double fists on both sides of 
my chest, which knocked me down on the floor 
more than once ....I begged him to shoot me 
with two bullets .... He commented that he 
doesn't kill but he squeezes the individual until 
he brings out what is inside him.       A A AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX B B B B $$ $$    195195195195    
 
implement in the bathrooms to help to do that, in a ddition to their continuous 
surveillance without my having the same advantage . .. I slept because of 
exhaustion for very few hours, the officer awakenin g me to resume the 
investigation, which continued all of Sunday until the evening.  By then I had 
completed narrating at length the events of many ye ars, such as travel, which 
[the officer] emphasizes, and the beginning of my r elationship with the 
Palestinian Red Crescent, the Palestinians outside the Crescent whom I met in 
Lebanon in 1981, whom I saw after that, and the nat ure of my relationship with 
them.  He further asked about illegitimate and anta gonistic acts against the 
security of the country which [the Palestinians] as ked of me.  My answer was 
identical to the fact of the matter -- that all of them asked nothing of me, but that 
they find that what I do regarding medical support to be more than anyone else 
and they praised that a lot throughout the 12 years  ... After saying "give him food 
and a cigarette," he left me at a late hour on Sund ay. He resumed the 
investigation on Monday morning, February 11, 1991 ... until midday, at which 
point I covered up to 1989 ... I was shocked after midday by his screaming and 
beating me violently with double fists on both side s of my chest, which knocked 
me down on the floor more than once (the guard lift ed me up), barraging me 
with the most abominable expressions, accusing me o f wasting the time of the 
State Security apparatus and disregarding his valua ble time, which the country 
paid for by sending him on missions abroad ... and in my capacity of being a son 
of a whore, as he says, he either will ruin my outs ide life completely by 
detention and summoning everyone I meet, to force m e to flee the country, or 
get rid of me completely in broad daylight, as he d id recently with a physician of 
the religious tendencies.4 
 
 He screamed: Take off his clothes ... and the proc edure repeats for a 
period of time in multiples of the first time.  He threatens that he will ride me 
and perform a sexual act on me  ... Then I was tied  in the same way, the metal rod 
which separates my knees put in place, and what I c onsidered a chair 
positioned over my chest.  He went quickly over my body from the top (with 
electricity).  Then they removed my underwear.  His  total concentration was on 
this sensitive area, emphasizing to me, before he k nocked me down, that he will, 
as he says, make me impotent and that I will not le ave him a man.  I told him I do 
                                                                    
     4The reference appears to be to an Islamic activist,  possibly a member of the 
technically illegal Muslim Brotherhood party in Egy pt or another Islamist political 
organization -- MEW. 
He cursed me terribly and said: We are not like 
you sons of whores, and we do not fabricate, 
but we are an apparatus which works through 
a scientific method .... He continued to torture 
me with electricity.       196 196196196    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX BB BB    
 
not need more and as long as I am not registered wi th you here and no one 
knows my whereabouts and, given the ease of getting  rid of my body, I begged 
him to shoot me with two bullets and not to continu e insulting me more than 
this ... and I am in my total mental capacity and I  lived my life fully and I won't 
leave orphans or a widow behind me ... and the fait h of my elderly mother will 
help her to endure the written fate and destiny ...  He commented on this in a 
vulgar voice, emphasizing this time that he doesn't  kill but he squeezes the 
individual until he brings out what is inside him . ..  
 
 At that moment, I asked him to write down what he wants me to say and 
I will sign it,  since I am incapable of inventing and charging unfounded 
allegations about the Palestinians I know or about myself ... The monster 
erupted and roared.  He cursed me terribly and said : We are not like you sons of 
whores, and we do not fabricate, but we are an appa ratus which works through 
a scientific method.  ...  My last words were that the scientific method is to 
gather enough information about me by surveillance,  eavesdropping or sending 
informers who are close to me, in order to confront  me with facts, not to ask me 
to create events by torture and beating ... Immedia tely after I finished my words, 
I found myself on my back so he could continue to t orture me with electricity, 
which I have already described ... This time God he lped me with continuous 
speech while I was under electricity, instead of bi ting the metal rod like the first 
time ...  
 
 Strangely, my speech had a meaning, although I did  not prepare it in 
advance ... I told him: You are wretched, you are s uspicious and you have no way 
of verifying anything except by this heinous act .. . your expressions do not shake 
me because you are cursing someone in your imaginat ion, not the person who 
is in front of you.  Our country will not progress as long as you treat people like 
me in this manner.  I presented only one research a bout the children of the 
intifada , which did not cost more than five thousand dollar s but will yield us 
about a half-million dollars from international org anizations to build a 
psychiatric care center in Gaza ... And it is diffi cult for me to remember such 
words because I was jerking under severe pain while  I was talking like this ... 
But I think that it made it easier for me and made me endure the long period, 
which I cannot specify exactly, but it was  much lo nger than the first time, which 
seemed endless ... This session concluded with word s from an older person (the 
one who was called pasha the first time) who was pr esent without my knowing 
it, and who said only: Stop. 
 
 This painful, degrading session ended ... and he o rdered that all of my     A A AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX B B B B $$ $$    197197197197    
 
clothes be put on me ... and he resumed interrogati ng me until the early hours of 
the morning of Tuesday, February 12, 1991.  On the basis of his method, it seems 
that he realized after this session that I had noth ing to say except what I really 
said ... and the procedure of the investigation ref lects this. 
 
 He finally asked me about two or three points whic h were not 
incriminating but at least they were tangible point s.  I answered with complete 
clarity and elaboration, adding information that cl early they did not know ... I 
challenged him politely if he could find one word o r one event I mentioned that 
was incorrect or evasive ... He told me that he wil l resume the interrogation 
early the next day.  He ordered security to give me  a cigarette and feed me 
because I had not eaten since the morning ...  
 
 They took me from his room another time through th e door into the 
large room in which I was detained with others ... I continued to be blindfolded 
and handcuffed the rest of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thur sday, Friday and Saturday, 
awaiting the resumption of the interrogation ... Su ddenly I heard his voice 
another time ... I was concentrating on my surround ings with sharp attention ... 
Some of [the detainees] start to cry from the momen t the security takes them 
from the large room in which we are held, and conti nue with audible crying 
after passing through the door of the officer's adj acent room.  Then we hear 
relentless screaming until they return to us.  Then  they begin to calm down to 
the point of long sobbing, which exposes them to re proach and some degrading 
words from our guards, who also tell them occasiona lly to save themselves so 
the torture will stop.  Most of the time we were ab out 14 persons, which I 
realized when the security made computations about the food late at night, 
when they were calculating the sum of 28 plus 14 .. .

transferred ... Then on 
Friday two others came 
... On Saturday, February

evening ... and they told 
me you will receive 
your belongings and I 
actually received them 
... Then I went back to 
the large room 
handcuffed and 
blindfolded (the blindfold was partially removed, w hile the guard was behind 
me so I didn't see him, in order to see my belongin gs and sign for their receipt) 
... Moments later, they told me that the orders are  to handcuff me behind my 
back.  After a while I was called to meet another o fficer.  I did not know him from 
before, but his voice indicated he was in his mid-5 0's.  He told me that the result 
of my interrogation is positive and that a recommen dation was submitted to the 
administration not to resume the period of detentio n, which has been decided, 
and that I am a person who exhibited readiness to c ooperate with them.  The 
officer praised their good treatment of me because I was not exposed to torture, 
according to him.  He apologized for the blindfold and handcuffs which I wore as 
I stood in front of him, praising the scientific me thod they follow ... When I asked 
him if he was speaking seriously, he told me: Of co urse. Did anybody torture 
you? ... Avoiding any arguments, I told him to excu se me from answering this 
question now because, really, the prospect of going  outside from this hell 
started to tempt me ...  He pointed out, finally .. ........ that human rights in Egypt are 
better than elsewhere ... I told him: Really, at le ast it's better than Syria and Iraq -
- there's no comparison ... He then told me: It's e ven better than America and 
France. At any rate, be careful because the human r ights movement is directed 
from outside. ... I left him while he was saying to  the guards: Good treatment 
until his transfer. 
 
 I left this floor in the company of a guard. While  we were going 
downstairs he lifted the blindfold and opened the h andcuffs ... We went to the 
ground floor and he took me to the office of an int elligence officer in the 
Palestine Branch ... where I met Maj. Hassan Tantaw i and Col. 'Az sitting in his 
office in the same room ... Maj. Hassan welcomed me , ordered me a cup of tea, The officer praised their good treatment of me

anything else I needed because, regrettably, there is a detention order.  I 
actually called my family to reassure my elderly mo ther and to tell her the good 
circumstances I am in, telling her not to worry at all and that I'm in need of 
nothing.  I thanked Maj. Hassan Tantawi, who then s ent me to the detention

without any sleep until the morning among more than  twenty people, stunned 
by everything that had happened.

 Mustafa Naib, a steel worker at the state-owned st eel plant in Helwan, 
was detained from August 6, 1989 until November 25,  1989.  During this time, he 
was tortured in SSI custody.  He described the even ts surrounding the work 
stoppage at the plant in August 1989, an event that  led to hundreds of arrests.1   
 
 Naib said that a newspaper on August 3, 1989 repor ted that the police 
were looking for him and four others.  Naib contact ed a lawyer, and turned himself 
in at the police station in Heliopolis on August 6,  1989.  He said that he was 
charged on four counts: agitating to strike, destru ction of public property, 
opposing the authorities, and threatening public pr oductivity. Naib denied these 
accusations and the prosecutor ordered fifteen days  of detention to allow further 
investigation.   
                                                                    
     1Naib said that some 24,000 workers at the Helwan st eel plant labored under poor 
conditions, causing many health problems and indust rial accidents.  When the company 
began making a profit, the workers union demanded i mprovement in their work conditions, 
better wages, and a daily meal at the factory.  The se requests were refused by 
management, and the workers in turn refused to acce pt their wages.  The steel plant is 
controlled by a Board of Directors composed of equa l representation from the union and 
the management.  On both sides, forty percent of th e directors are elected and sixty percent 
appointed.  The two elected workers were "frozen ou t of the board" when the dispute over 
wages and work conditions emerged, Naib said.   
 The workers organized a "sit-down" or work stoppag e to protest the exclusion of 
their elected representatives, demanding their rein statement to the board and compliance 
by the company to the other demands.  The workers w ere initially told that there would be 
negotiations.  Instead, security forces invaded the  plant on August 2, 1989.  A worker, Said 
Abd el-Hai, was killed, sixteen were injured, and s ome 850 workers were arrested.  The 
police also launched an intensive search of the pla nt's twenty-four acres and the 
surrounding neighborhood for other strike supporter s and organizers.

 He said that at this point, he was confronted by a bout fifty "special 
forces" soldiers, all wearing black uniforms and da rk sunglasses.  He was placed 
in a car with two rifle-bearing soldiers and driven  to the police station in Nasser 
City.  He arrived there at five in the evening and found another colleague, 
Muhammed Mustafa, in a cell.  They were confined to gether, and at 10:30 p.m. they 
were awakened and blindfolded.  Mustafa Naib was ta ken to an office where he 
was tortured.

 He was repeatedly slapped across the face and on t he sides of the head, 
and questioned about the National Progressive Union ist Party (NPUG, also known 
as Tagammu) alleged to be responsible for the strik e.  When he denied this, he 
was repeatedly slapped about the head and face whil e forced to stand blindfolded 
in front of his interrogators.  His hands were not bound, and he was fully clothed. 
 
 He was questioned about his lawyer who had accompa nied him when he 
turned himself in to the police.  He then had his l egs spread apart by a chair or 
stool (he couldn't see but said it felt like a piec e of furniture) and was repeatedly 
kicked in the buttocks and the peri-anal region.  D uring the kicking, he was told 
that he must describe his relationship to his lawye r, how the strike was organized, 
who did what among the workers, and so on.  He cont inued to deny any knowledge 
of these matters.  The chair or stool was then remo ved and he was forced to run 
back and forth in the room while being slapped and punched by the interrogators.  
The blows were directed to his head and chest.  He was then pushed out of the 
room, the blindfold removed, and he was returned to  the cell.  The police then went 
through the same process with Muhammed Mustafa.  Ea ch session of 
interrogation and torture lasted about two hours. 
 
 On August 7, Naib was taken for fingerprinting and  photographing.  He 
asked for food (none had been provided since his ar rival at Nasser City) and after 
much discussion some beans and bread were brought t o him.  On August 8, he was 
transferred to Tora prison.

 At 1:45 a.m. on August 8, Naib was removed from th e cell for questioning, 
taken blindfolded and with his hands bound.  He and  Muhammed Mustafa were 
placed in a small, closed room for about one hour, and then transported by car to 
SSI headquarters at Lazoughly. There, he heard the sounds of men screaming as 
though they were being tortured. He was exposed to very warm air then very cold     A A AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX C C C C $$ $$    203203203203    
 
air.  Finally, he was informed that Muhammed Mustaf a had died from torture.  He 
was forced to step over a body that was said to be that of his friend.  Four security 
officers shouted at him to stand, to sit, to stand -- while striking him with their fists. 
 He was then forced into another room where a voice  greeted him as "Mustafa 
Engels," but Naib did not respond.

 A new voice began interrogating him, asking questi ons about the 
political plans of the National Progressive Unionis t Party.  He replied that there 
were no political plans, that the sit-in had just b een a workers' action.  The hitting 
began again. 
 
 He said that he was offered two choices -- to tell  the truth about NPUG and 
the strike, or die.  His interrogator told the sold iers to strip him from the waist up.  
He was placed in a chair and electric shocks were a pplied to his nipples, arms 
and neck while the 
questioning 
continued for about 
one hour.  He was 
then removed to 
another room and 
lighted paper held 
close to his mouth 
and nose 
intermittently for 
about thirty 
minutes.  He asked for water and was refused.  He w as then taken back into the 
room where the electric shock had been applied, and  the interrogator, now 
speaking softly, urged him to cooperate, "for the g ood of Egypt."  Naib refused and 
was again electric shocked.  His interrogator began  dictating a confession 
regarding his role in planning the strike.  He refu sed to sign, declaring that the 
confession was not true.  He was again electric sho cked for another half-hour or 
so.  The interrogator then told him that he would b e called back the next day and 
sent Naib to his cell around midnight. 
 
 Naib was able to get a message to his lawyer throu gh another prisoner 
who was being taken to court.  His lawyer immediate ly went to the prosecutor and 
requested a special investigation into the use of t orture.  Naib was summoned 
before the prosecutor who noted the lacerations on his neck, the superficial burns 
from the shocks, and the bruises in the peri-anal r egion.  Naib said that he told his He was given two choices: to tell the truth about t he

full story to the prosecutor, who asked whether he knew his torturers and whether 
he was being forced to confess.  Naib asked for pro tection while he was in Tora 
prison.  Three days later, he was able to see the p rison doctor, who documented 
the peri-anal bruises and the lacerations but not t he shock marks. 
 
 Naib said that for the next two months he was unab le to sit comfortably. 
He had some nightmares but no major sleep disturban ce, flashbacks or 
hallucinations.  He was to be released on September  17, 1989, but his release was 
opposed by the Minister of the Interior, who used h is power under the emergency 
laws to continue his detention until November 25, 1 989.   
 
 When Naib was released on November 25, the Ministr y of Industry 
transferred him from his job at the Helwan steel pl ant to a factory that 
manufactured pens, decreasing his monthly salary fr om 215 Egyptian pounds to 
148 pounds.  He also had to pay an additional sixty -five pounds monthly in 
additional transportation costs because his new wor k site was quite far from his 
apartment.2

remain in the standing position for eight days exce pt for meals and the periods of 
interrogation.  He was allowed to use the toilet on ce daily, in the morning, except 
for a two-day period when he was neither allowed to  eat nor use the toilet. 
 
 During the questioning he was repeatedly shocked o n his nipples, 
behind the ears, on the lips, tongue and genitals.  He was also beaten with sticks 
on the soles of his feet and on the legs.  On one o ccasion he was drenched in cold 
water and then hung by the wrists in front of the b arred window.  He lost 
consciousness twice during the electric shock tortu re and three to four times 
while hanging.  The questioning finally stopped bec ause of his deteriorating 
physical condition.  He was examined by a prison ph ysician while blindfolded and 
lying on the floor of his cell.  The physician aske d him no questions, took no 
medical history; he simply palpated his pulse and a uscultated his heart and 
lungs.  Ashof did not hear the physician discuss hi s case with the security police. 
 
 A physical examination of Ahmed Ashof on May 26, 1 990, when he was 
thirty-three years old, revealed well-healed scars measuring 0.5 cm x 6 cm on 
both wrists, volar surface, consistent with injury from handcuffs.  He also had a 
well-healed 0.2 cm x 1.5 cm scar across the bridge of his nose consistent with the 
reported injury from being tightly blindfolded for more than a week.3

 Dr. Muhammed Abd el-Latif, a publisher of children 's books who holds a 
medical degree from Cairo University, is a supporte r of the Muslim Brotherhood.  
He was thirty-seven years old at the time of his in terview in 1990. He was detained 
by security forces from June 26, 1989 until August 12 or 13, 1989.  He said that he 
was summoned in mid-June 1989 by SSI in Giza to ans wer questions about "the 
Islamic message" in some his books.  He did not res pond to the request. 
 
 At 1:00 a.m. on June 26, 1989, eight police in pla inclothes entered his 
apartment, searched his belongings, and confiscated  books and papers.  They had 
no warrant.  He was then blindfolded, handcuffed, a nd taken down the stairs.  This 
was witnessed by his wife, but his four children re mained asleep.  He was driven

to a police station and placed in a room about 5x2. 5 meters with four others.  
Three of the other prisoners told him that they had  been in detention for four 
months.  The room had a small toilet in the corner,  but there were no beds or 
mattresses. 
 
 He was then removed to another room for two hours of questioning while 
blindfolded and handcuffed.  The doctor said that t he questioning started politely 
and became more and more abusive and threatening.  On the second day, he was 
again questioned and threatened with destruction of  his company and himself.  On 
the third day, he was placed on the floor of a car and driven to SSI headquarters at 
Lazoughly, where he was kept bound and blindfolded for five days.   
 
 He was stripped of his clothes down to his undersh orts and forced to 
stand for forty hours, during which time his lower legs and feet became very 
swollen.  He said that another eight to twelve pris oners were standing or lying in 
the same room, some moaning in pain, all stripped t o their undershorts. 
 
 He was then punched in the face, chest and abdomen , and struck with 
wooden sticks.  Electric shocks were applied to his  genitals and nipples for about 
fifteen minutes until he was exhausted.  He did not  lose consciousness.  During the 
torture, he continued to be questioned about his ro le in and the structure of the 
Muslim Brotherhood.  The police threatened that his  wife would be involved if he 
did not cooperate.  He was not threatened with deat h, although he stated that at 
one point he prayed to God to die. 
 
 Food was provided twice a day consisting of stale bread and poorly 
prepared beans.  Some of his fellow prisoners vomit ed after eating the food, and 
the guards then tried to force them to eat their ow n vomitus.  He was questioned 
for five days, always bound and blindfolded, before  being transferred to Tora 
prison.  There he was placed in a 2x2 meter cell wi th a crude toilet and no bedding. 
 He said that eventually this cell held three addit ional prisoners.  Dr. el-Latif said 
that after being transferred to Tora, he was no lon ger questioned or tortured.4

 At 1:30 a.m. on August 6, 1989, uniformed police e ntered the house of Dr. 
Sayd Fahmy el-Shinawi, a urologic surgeon. They sea rched his library and 
removed him in handcuffs to SSI headquarters at Laz oughly, where he was kept 
blindfolded and handcuffed for ten days.  After his  arrival, he was kept standing for 
ten hours and denied even sips of water.  Thereafte r he was allowed to use the 
toilet once a day.  He was given three loaves of br ead a day and sips of water.  He 
was unable to sleep with his hands tied behind his back. 
 
 At the end of ten days, he was taken to the prosec utor, who stated that 
there was no case against him but that the Minister  of the Interior had ordered 
him to be detained.  He was never formally charged.   He was detained until 
November 12, 1989.  When he was presented to the pr osecutor the second time, he 
was accused of membership in an illegal Shia organi zation (see Footnote 8, below, 
for background about this case, which involved accu sations against fifty-two 
individuals in August 1989).  When Dr. el-Shinawi d enied this, he was released.  (He 
said that he had been arrested at Cairo airport two  years earlier while en route to 
London, but on that occasion the prosecutor release d him immediately.) 
  
 Dr. el-Shinawi said that during his detention he w as verbally abused, and 
punched in the face and in the genitals while being  commanded to "tell 
everything, you son of a dog."  His captors threate ned to bring his wife to the 
prison and to break up the marriage of his daughter s.  His family did not know 
where he was for almost one month.  He first saw hi s family after forty-five days in 
prison.  He was held in seven different locations: five prisons and two police 
stations.  While in Tora prison, he was without wat er in the tap in his cell for fifteen 
days. 
  
 During his detention his practice was closed for t hree months, his office 
ransacked, and more than 200 books taken from his p ersonal library by the police, 
never to be returned.  Some of his patients postpon ed their care, expecting him to 
return any day.  One of his patients died while he was in detention after delaying 
seeking care from anyone else. After his release, D r. el-Shinawi was told that he 
must report to the government whenever he planned t o travel outside of Egypt.  He 
has had several invitations to travel but has decli ned because he refuses to 
inform the government.  He said that he was sleepin g poorly, and had nightmares 
and flashbacks.  While in detention, he developed d iabetes. 
 
 He has not sought legal advice since his release.  He was not active in the 
Medical Syndicate or any other groups.  He believes  that he was detained and 
tortured because of his writings, some of which hav e been critical of the     208 208208208    $$ $$    AA AAPPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX PPENDIX CC CC

 After general surgeon Dr. Muhammed el-Shinawi's fa ther, Dr. Sayed 
Fahmy el-Shinawi, was arrested on August 6, 1989 (s ee the preceding account), 
security forces returned to the family home every n ight at about 1:00 a.m.  The 
force usually was composed of about fifteen men in black uniforms, who searched 
the apartment while Dr. Muhammed, his mother and on e of his sisters watched.   
 
 At 1:45 a.m. on the thirteenth night, Dr. Muhammed  was informed by the 
force that they wanted him to come along for a few hours of questioning.  He asked 
whether he should prepare a bag of personal effects  and was told that was not 
necessary, that he would be back in a few hours.  D r. Muhammed decided to put a 
change of clothes and toilet articles in a bag anyw ay.  When he reached the street, 
the bag was taken from him and three soldiers seize d him and threw him into a 
truck.  He was then asked if he had anything that c ould be used to blindfold his 
eyes.  Before he realized that he was unwittingly c ooperating, he said, "Yes, in my 
bag."  Whereupon, one of the soldiers was instructe d to remove a handkerchief 
from the bag and cover the doctor's eyes. 
 
 Dr. el-Shinawi was taken to Lazoughly, arriving ab out 2:30 a.m. He was 
placed in a cell and instructed to lie on the floor  and rest.  His hands were bound 
behind him and the blindfold was left in place.  In  the morning he was taken to be 
questioned.  The officer started off politely, aski ng him the names of all of his 
relatives.  He was allowed to sit but remained blin dfolded.  The questioning lasted 
about ninety minutes, covering details of his trip to the U.S., what hotels he had 
stayed in, why he went there to study pediatric uro logy, and other details. 
 
 He was brought back for further questioning in the  afternoon, but the 
                                                                    
     5Interview by Dr. Robert S. Lawrence, Cairo, May 28,  1990.  Dr. el-Shinawi, a urologic 
surgeon, was sixty-seven years old at the time of h is interview, married, with one son and 
two daughters.  He was educated in Egypt, with addi tional training in Europe and the United 
States.  About 8 years ago he thought he would reti re from medical practice and began to 
write books and journal articles about the history of the Middle East, Islam, the Ottoman 
Empire, politics, and democracy.  He never stopped practicing medicine.

tone of the interview had changed.  He was now forc ed to stand, and he was asked 
harshly whether he would now tell the truth.  There  was a brief argument between 
officers about who should conduct the interrogation . 
 
 He was forced to stand twenty-four hours a day, fr om the second to the 
seventh day of his detention.  He was stripped to h is undershorts, tortured with an 
electric prod to his limbs, back and anus on a dail y basis except for one half-day of 
"rest."  He was threatened that his mother and sist ers would be brought to the 
prison if he did not cooperate.  He was burned with  cigarettes on a regular basis 
on his lips, arms and legs.  On one occasion, a cig arette was placed on the floor 
and he was forced to step on it barefoot.  On the f ourth day of his detention he 
heard his father's voice at the other end of the ce ll, where he estimated a total of 
twenty to thirty prisoners were being held.  He ask ed permission of the guard to 
say a few words to his father but this request was refused. 
 
 At the end of a week of this treatment, he was fin gerprinted, 
photographed and then dismissed from Lazoughly at m idnight, August 23.  He said 
that after his release he had great difficulty slee ping for about thirty days, 
expecting the police to return each night.  At the time of his interview, he said that 
he still was experiencing disturbed sleep with nigh tmares.6

 A resident of Fayoum told MEW that he was brought to the Central 
Security Forces camp in al-'Zab in September 1987, after being chased into an 
alley during a security force round-up near Beni Su ef.  "They were arresting 
anyone who looked like a fundamentalist. I was runn ing away and was hit by a car 
in the alley.  When I woke up after the accident, I  was in the military camp in al-
'Zab," he said. 
 
 There, he was beaten unconscious by three SSI offi cers in plainclothes 
and five SSI soldiers in uniforms.  After the beati ng, he was unable to move his 
right leg, and his right thigh swelled to double it s size.  He was seen by a doctor, 
who requested that an X-ray be taken.  The X-ray sh owed that bones in his thigh

had been chipped, and he was brought to Fayoum hosp ital where his leg was put 
in a cast.  "I stayed there for six weeks, in a spe cial room that was not in a public 
part of the hospital.  There was always a guard at the door and my family never 
came."   
 
 After the cast was removed, he was returned to the  camp, even though 
his leg was still weak.  "My leg needed more treatm ent ... they made me stretch it," 
he said. He was held for twenty additional days and  "no one knew where I was."  
During this time, he was blindfolded and brought fo r investigation over a period of 
at least ten days.  "They used something hot on my skin while asking questions 
like `Why do you go to this mosque?' It felt like a  small pen, hot and hard.  It was 
not electric."  He also was struck on the elbow and  shoulders with "a long, strong 
wire that draws blood," he told MEW.7

 A thirty-nine-year-old internist and assistant lec turer at Mansoura 
University, Dr. Ahmad Ghassem el-Nafees, told MEW o f his arrest in May 1987, 
following the attempted assassination of former Int erior Minister Hassan Abu 
Basha.  "I was first taken to a Central Security Fo rces barracks and then to Tora 
Istikbal prison.  I was blindfolded and my hands we re cuffed behind my back.  I 
was taken somewhere outside the prison, which I kne w was the Institute for Police 
Training in Cairo.  They put me somewhere in the op en, still blindfolded and 
handcuffed.  I couldn't sit or rest.  I spent thirt y-six hours like this.  There were tens 
of people with me in this place.  We were not inter rogated."   
 
 He was brought back to Tora and held for two weeks  in solitary 
confinement in a cell had nothing in it -- "no matt ress, no blankets and 1.5 liters of 
water a day for all uses. "After two weeks, he was taken at midnight, blindfolded 
and handcuffed, to the Institute for Police Trainin g.  He was brought to a room 
which he believed was lighted. "They told me that c ollected all the information 
about me and started to ask random questions, such as why I painted my car, why I 
visited Cairo. I told them I don't visit Cairo.  Th ey wanted to know who Oussama 
was."

 He was electric shocked on the head and he said hi s interrogators 
promised to "make me crazy."  He was shocked on his  nipples and sexual organs 
"and they told me that would castrate me.  This wen t on for five hours ... with 
strange, random, disconnected questions.  They aske d why I wanted to kill Abu 
Basha, and if I had made an organization."  From th e voices in the room, he 
believed there were four or five men present, inclu ding SSI officer Ahmad 
Noureddin, whom he said he knows personally.  One p erson was giving 
instructions to the others. 
 
 "I cried, jumped, resisted and screamed from the e lectricity.  It was 
intermittent over the five hours.  Most of the time  I was standing, then falling down. 
 The electricity was used, followed by questions, f ollowed by more electricity with 
more questions.  The purpose was to drive me crazy, " he guessed.  "They had no 
specific questions, and they didn't want specific i nformation.  They were very 
careful not to leave any marks."  After this ordeal , he was held outdoors until two 
or three in the afternoon and then returned to Tora  prison for three days, after 
which time he was released.8  
                                                                    
     8Dr. Nafees was one of forty individuals arrested in  August 1989 and accused of being part 
of an illegal Shia organization planning violent ac tions in Egypt.  "We were not activists at 
all," he told MEW.  "The government just needed abo ut thirty to forty people to make a case.  
The evidence used against me was five books removed  from my house, a 1978 issue of 
Newsweek  magazine, and another magazine with a picture of A yatollah Khomeni's funeral.  
They even took books that attacked Iran."  EOHR rep orted that on August 6, 1989, forty 
individuals, out of fifty-two accused, were arreste d for allegedly forming an illegal pro-
Iranian Shia organization aimed "at changing by for ce the political system, and planning to 
undertake hostile actions against American, Israeli , Iraqi and Kuwaiti interests in Egypt."  
EOHR found "a thick shadow of doubt on the seriousn ess of the investigation which led to 
the imprisonment of these persons....Among those ar rested are persons with no concern for 
political action or Shiite thought....Doubts on the  seriousness of specific allegations against 
these people are reinforced by the rejection of the  Supreme State Security Court [on 
September 20, 1989] of the detention orders issued by the Minister of Interior for thirteen of 
the accused."  (EOHR, "A Report on the Torture of t he Detained in the Case of the Shiite 
Organization," October 1, 1989.)     APPENDIX D APPENDIX DAPPENDIX DAPPENDIX D
