Hogan, involving an appeal against the deportation of an Egyptian national from the United States in reliance upon diplomatic assurances against torture from the Egyptian government.This is a test case regarding US law on diplomatic assurances in the immigration context, which currently prohibits the person subject to deportation from seeing the assurances and from challenging them for reliability or sufficiency before an independent body.The affidavit includes a review of the use of diplomatic assurances worldwide, including the ability of persons to challenge the reliability of such guarantees in other countries; the history of Egypt's use of torture; examples of Egypt's failure to abide by diplomatic assurances in other cases; and the reasons why diplomatic assurances against torture from governments in countries where torture is routine do not provide adequate protection against such abuse.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa United States Egypt US Foreign PolicyTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism TortureRelated contentkhouzam0807.pdfMore ReadingOctober 10, 2022News ReleaseBahrain: Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 28, 2022CommentaryFree Abdulhadi Al-KhawajaReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 7, 2021Report“Security Forces Dealt with Them”Suspicious Killings and Extrajudicial Executions by Egyptian Security ForcesMore ReadingOctober 10, 2022News ReleaseBahrain: Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 28, 2022CommentaryFree Abdulhadi Al-KhawajaMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
