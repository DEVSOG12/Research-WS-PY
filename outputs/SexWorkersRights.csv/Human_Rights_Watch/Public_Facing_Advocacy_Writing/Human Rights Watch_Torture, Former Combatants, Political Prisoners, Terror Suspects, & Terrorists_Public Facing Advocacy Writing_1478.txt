We found that government forces have been responsible for the majority of abuses, subjecting tens of thousands to arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes. We have extensively documented the arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearances of dozens of peaceful activists, human rights defenders, journalists, doctors, and humanitarian aid workers by the Syrian government during the crisis, and, alongside their families, advocated for their release.Armed groups opposing the Syrian government have also committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, including abductions, torture and summary killings. To date, the fate of more than 20 civilians, men, women, and children, from Kefraya and Foua, two predominantly Shia towns in Idlib formerly besieged by armed opposition groups, remains unknown following their abduction during the car bombing that targeted the evacuation convoy transiting in Aleppo city before heading to government-controlled areas. Moreover, local sources in Afrin reported at least 86 abuses that appear to amount to instances of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearance of civilians by pro-Turkey armed groups.The Syrian government has recently updated civil registries in several parts of the country, including the Damascus countryside, Hama, Aleppo, and Sweida governorates to show individuals known to have been previously detained and disappeared by the Syrian government as dead. In some cases, families were provided with death certificates reflecting dates of death as far back as 2013 and indicating cause of death as ‘heart attack.’It is estimated that hundreds of families have discovered the fate of their missing relatives in this manner. However, the government has not responded to the relatives’ request to obtain the remains of their loved ones and information on, the circumstances of the death and enforced disappearance. Many were too scared to request the additional information. As things stand, there is no way to verify the deaths without the government returning the remains to the families, and without the launch of an independent investigation into the cause of death. The government’s response, or lack thereof, is contrary to its duty to conduct prompt, independent and impartial investigations into enforced disappearances and to uphold relatives of the disappeared right to truth and reparation.Moreover, the government continues to detain tens of thousands in official and unofficial detention facilities. The government denies international monitors access to nearly all of these facilities, and there are no due process or fair trial guarantees for these detainees.We seek an understanding from the eminent members of the working group on what your priorities are with regards to addressing the fate and whereabouts of those the government continues to arbitrarily detain and those it has forcibly disappeared, and those who have died in detention; and specifically:Will the working group request clarification from the Syrian government with regards to the process and purpose behind updating the registries and will it press the government to inform the families of the victims of the whereabouts of the remains, and return the remains to the families?Will the working group push for independent and impartial investigations into the deaths that occurred in detention, given previous findings that ill-treatment and torture of detainees was widespread in these facilities?What steps will the working group take to ensure that the Syrian government and armed opposition groups disclose the names and locations of people who were arbitrarily detained, subjected to enforced disappearance and abducted and provide answers to the families in a manner that respects the rights of victims and their families and their security?What steps will the working group take to ensure the release of all arbitrarily detained persons, including human rights defenders, journalists, doctors, and humanitarian aid workers who remain in government and armed groups detention centers?Will the working group prioritize negotiating immediate and unhindered access for recognized international detention monitors to all detention facilities, official and unofficial?Will the working group cooperate with the United Nations, and the International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism to pursue justice for violations committed in the context of detentions and disappearances by the Syrian government, and other parties to the conflict, in order to enable a sustainable political transition to take place?On September 7, Turkey, Russia, and Iran will be meeting to discuss the conflict in Syria. It is an opportunity for a concerted effort by the three to effectively and justly resolve the issue of the detained, disappeared and abducted.We urge the working group to treat this issue with the care it demands and look forward to receiving your response to the queries posed above after the meeting.Sincerely,Amnesty InternationalDawlatyThe Day AfterFamilies for FreedomThe Global Centre for the Responsibility to ProtectHuman Rights WatchHurras NetworkJust Foreign PolicyThe Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights StudiesSyrian Association for Missing and Conscience DetaineesThe Syrian Center for Statistics and ResearchSyrians for Truth and JusticeThe Syrian Network for Human RightsRethink Rebuild SocietyUrnammu for Justice and Human RightsYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryEurope/Central Asia Russia Turkey Middle East/North Africa Iran SyriaTopicDetention without Trial TortureMore ReadingOctober 20, 2022CommentaryRussian Police are Torturing Anti-War ActivistsOctober 19, 2022ReportUkraine: Russian Forces Tortured Izium DetaineesReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsNovember 3, 2021ReportDismantling DetentionInternational Alternatives to Detaining ImmigrantsMore ReadingOctober 20, 2022CommentaryRussian Police are Torturing Anti-War ActivistsOctober 19, 2022ReportUkraine: Russian Forces Tortured Izium DetaineesMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
