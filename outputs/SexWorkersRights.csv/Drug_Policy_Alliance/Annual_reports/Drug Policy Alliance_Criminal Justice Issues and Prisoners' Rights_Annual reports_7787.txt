Drug Policy Action, a 501 (c)(4) organization. References to “DPA” refer to the work of both organizations.b 1WE ARE THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE
The Drug Policy Alliance is the leading 
organization in the United States working to 
end the war on drugs, repair its harms, and 
build a better approach. We envision a just 
society in which the use and regulation of 
drugs are grounded in science, compassion, 
health, and human rights. We fight every 
day and at every policy level – local, state, 
federal, and international – to change laws, 
advance justice, and save lives.

34 5At the Drug Policy Alliance, 2020 was a year of fear and 
hope, but also clarity of purpose: we have always known 
that the war on drugs is a war on people, and we will 
always fight for people. This past year shone a light on 
that truth in ways that were sadly but entirely predictable, 
as injustices compound in times of crisis. 
Drug policies should be about health. This year, we 
saw COVID-19 tear through prisons, jails, and detention 
centers, crowded with hundreds of thousands of people 
incarcerated for drugs. We also saw the pandemic fuel 
a major upsurge in drug overdose deaths, exposing the 
paucity of services for people who use drugs and the 
barriers – always cruel and senseless – that they face. 
As long as the country’s drug policies fail to prioritize 
health, we will fight. We will fight for decarceration paired 
with re-entry services, and for better access to health 
and harm reduction programs. Letter from the Board Chair and Executive Director
WE WERE BUILT FOR THIS MOMENT
Drug policies should be about justice. This year, 
we saw Black lives end at the hands of police, with 
law enforcement and the media using victims’ drug 
involvement as an excuse. As a mass movement for 
racial justice swelled, we joined our allies in the streets, 
calling out the racism in the criminal legal system and 
demanding reform. 
As long as the country’s drug policies fail to prioritize 
justice, we will fight. We will fight to decriminalize all drugs, 
and to reinvest law enforcement resources into services 
that contribute to community safety and wellbeing. 
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the national reckoning with 
systemic racism and white nationalism, and the threats 
to our democracy, DPA remained focused. The lifesaving 
reforms we have championed for decades have never 
made more sense. We were built for this moment. 4 5Drug possession is the most arrested offense in the 
country. Since our founding, DPA has worked to eliminate 
criminal penalties for all drugs – not just marijuana. On 
Election Day in 2020, we finally made it happen, when 
Oregon voters approved Measure 110, our first-in-the-
nation all-drug decriminalization and treatment initiative. 
It was a paradigm-shifting win, showcasing the power of 
DPA’s approach.
Oregonians resoundingly chose health over punishment, 
inspiring advocates across the country to imagine a 
future where drugs are decriminalized. And Oregon is 
just the beginning – we are already working on similar 
campaigns in states from Vermont to California and even 
at the federal level.
At the same time, despite two out of three people 
supporting its legalization, one person is still arrested 
for marijuana in the United States nearly every minute. 
Every hour. Every day. We chipped away at that painful 
reality on Election Day, passing marijuana legalization 
in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota, 
along with medical marijuana measures in Mississippi 
and South Dakota. We won every single ballot initiative Despite two out of three people 
supporting legalization,  
one person is still arrested for 
marijuana in the United States 
nearly every minute.  
Every hour. Every day.we supported this year. In 2021, all eyes are on DPA-led 
legalization campaigns in New York and New Mexico.
At the federal level, amidst the political chaos, the House 
of Representatives made history in December, voting 
in favor of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment 
and Expungement (MORE) Act, the first comprehensive 
marijuana reform legislation ever approved by either 
chamber of Congress. DPA worked tirelessly on the 
MORE Act for years, collaborating with Rep. Jerry Nadler 
and then-Sen. Kamala Harris to draft and introduce it, 
and building a powerful marijuana justice coalition to 
advocate for its passage. 6 7
Beyond the criminal legal system, the drug war is 
insidious, corrupting institutions and punishing people 
in every aspect of their daily lives, including education. 
For years, DPA fought to reinstate Pell Grants to people 
behind bars and to remove the “drug question” from 
federal financial aid forms. In the final weeks of 2020, 
we succeeded, as Congress repealed the law that made 
students ineligible for federal financial aid if they had 
been convicted of a drug crime, and lifted the 1994 
Crime Bill ban on aid for students in prison. 
This past year was a lot. Heartbreaking, inspiring, 
exhausting, and exhilarating. But with you fighting  
by our side, we prevailed. 
Together, we are building the world we deserve.  
Together, we will realize our vision for drug policies 
grounded in science, compassion, health,  
and human rights.

DRUG WAR  
POLICING Police are the frontline of drug war 
enforcement, and criminalization enables 
them to target, harass, and handcuff 
millions of people every year – especially 
people who are Black, Brown, Indigenous, 
LGBTQ+, women, young, and low-income 
– and entangle them in the criminal legal 
system. For non-citizens, the consequences 
of drug war policing are also severe – 
potentially leading to mandatory detention 
or deportation, or making them ineligible for 
lawful immigration status or asylum.
78 9Drug War Policing in Black  
Communities – To End the Drug War, 
Black Lives Have to Matter
Time and time again, drug use and possession – 
whether real or perceived – serve as a justification by 
law enforcement to dehumanize, strip dignity from, and 
ultimately kill people of color. As the righteous uprisings 
against state violence last year made clear, Black people 
regularly bear the brunt of violent drug war policing.
George Floyd drew his last breaths as a police officer 
taunted “don’t do drugs, kids” to the gathered crowd, 
and the press assailed his character for drug use and a 
prior drug arrest. Breonna Taylor was shot to death in her 
own bed by Louisville police who were serving a baseless 
warrant in a drug investigation. The war on drugs has fueled militarized policing, most 
prominently through the Department of Defense’s “1033 
program.” Since its creation in 1990, it has resulted in the 
transfer of approximately $7.2 billion in military-grade 
equipment to state, local, and tribal law enforcement 
agencies. This includes armored vehicles, assault rifles 
and other weapons, and explosives, as well as funding for 
special tactical teams for drug investigations.
Militarized responses to drug use prioritize brutal 
enforcement, criminalization, and punishment over 
community safety, health, and dignity. Often, jurisdictions 
in small towns receive equipment for which they have no 
rational use. This encourages a type of policing that is 
particularly violent, and has been shown to increase the 
number of police killings.
8Drug possession is the  
most arrested offense in  
the United States, with 
ONE ARREST EVERY 23 SECONDS. 8 9These killings, and the subsequent nationwide protests, 
reignited debate around the role of racism and policing 
in the drug war, as well as in society more broadly. In the 
days and weeks that followed, DPA stood in solidarity 
with protesters taking to the street across the nation 
and around the globe. We led a coalition of national 
organizations in a letter to Congress urging an end to the 
Trump Administration’s use of DEA resources to enforce 
laws that bear no relationship to drugs, particularly its plan 
to investigate events surrounding the protests.
In June, alongside Communities United for Police Reform, 
DPA helped pass the Safer New York Act, a package of 
bills that included several measures to address racism in 
policing, including practices that target people who use 
drugs, as well as the repeal of Section 50-A. For decades, 
Section 50-A had been used to hide rampant abuses 
by law enforcement, making New York one of the worst 
states in the country in terms of police secrecy and lack of 
transparency. Our victory was a crucial step towards ending 
an era of exemptions that allowed police departments to 
hide patterns of brutality, sexual violence, and other abuses.DPA will continue fighting to remove drug involvement as 
a cover for disregarding the dignity and sanctity of human 
life, and we are determined to hold the involved institutions 
accountable.
We know the drug war did not create institutional 
racism in the U.S. However, it feeds and bolsters the 
racist structures that extinguish Black life daily. The 
disproportionate focus on the risks of drugs, rather than 
the risks of the drug war, has been a distraction from the 
ways in which the color of a person’s skin, their perceived 
gender, or their socio-economic status make them a target 
for harassment and, far too often, death.
We refuse to stand by while another person cries out, as 
Eric Garner and George Floyd did, “I can’t breathe,” as law 
enforcement ends their life.
Ending the failed war on drugs is not enough to end 
racism, but it will disrupt a system that chips away daily at 
the very core of our shared humanity. We stand ready to 
work with our allies to do our part.
9DPA will continue fighting to remove drug involvement as a cover  
for disregarding the dignity and sanctity of human life.10 11
Drug possession is the most arrested 
offense in the United States, with one person 
arrested every 23 seconds. An arrest, even 
if it doesn’t result in a conviction, can lead 
to loss of employment, housing, parental 
rights, immigration status, and more. This 
overemphasis on criminalization distorts 
systems of care for people struggling with 
substance use disorders, contributing to an 
acute shortage of services for those who 
need and want them, and represents a vast 
waste of government resources.
10DECRIMINALIZING
DRUG USE AND  
POSSESSION 10 11
11The criminalization of drugs is a devastating form of 
systemic oppression: Black people in the U.S. are three 
times more likely to be arrested for drug use than white 
people, despite using drugs at the same rate – and in 
some places, the disparities are far greater.
Latinx people are also disproportionately harmed by the 
criminal legal system, although there is a serious lack 
of data due to how most states report criminalization 
statistics. In New York City, for instance, we know that 
Latinx people are arrested at nearly four times the rate 
of white people for marijuana, even though both groups 
use marijuana at a similar rate. We also know that 50% of 
federal drug cases are brought against people classified 
as Hispanic, even though this group makes up just 17% of 
the U.S. population.
As our country reckons with police violence, drug 
decriminalization is a concrete and effective solution to 
disrupt arrests, divest from the failed system, and invest in 
a compassionate alternative that has the potential to save 
lives through access to treatment and harm reduction. In November 2020, DPA and our partners achieved the 
most significant drug policy reform victory since the 
disastrous modern-day war on drugs began almost 50 
years ago. Voters in Oregon passed Measure 110*, the 
Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act, which ends 
criminal penalties for the personal possession of all drugs, 
for the first time ever in the United States. The measure 
also substantially expands access to evidence-informed 
services for substance use disorder, which can include drug 
treatment programs, harm reduction and recovery services, 
and housing assistance, funded with marijuana tax revenue 
and savings reinvested from the criminal legal system. The 
measure passed on Election Day with a resounding 58.5% 
of the vote and a 17-point margin of victory. 
Measure 110 was designed and spearheaded by Drug 
Policy Action, DPA’s advocacy affiliate, in partnership 
with a broad and deep coalition of state-based allies. It 
was informed by years of DPA’s policy and public opinion 
research, as well as by close consultation with local 
stakeholders and allies in Oregon. The criminalization of drugs is a devastating  
form of systemic oppression.
*This campaign was supported by Drug Policy Action.12 13As with everywhere in the United States, criminalization 
has caused untold devastation in Oregon. Law enforcement 
made 8,700 drug possession arrests in 2017. Black people 
were more than twice as likely to be convicted of felony 
possession despite no disparity in use, while Indigenous 
people were convicted at five times the rate of white 
people. One in ten Oregonians struggles with substance 
use disorder, and the state ranks nearly last in the country 
in access to publicly funded drug treatment programs. 
Oregon voters rightfully viewed this as a major crisis in their 
state. The Measure 110 victory is a landmark declaration 
that it’s time to stop criminalizing people for drug 
possession and instead shift to a health-based approach. 
The pandemic, which emerged as we were collecting 
signatures to qualify for the ballot, only made the 
campaign more urgent and compelling. As we well 
know, incarceration is a vulnerability in the fight against 
COVID-19 – people in jails and prisons, and those living 
in surrounding areas, are at greater risk of infection due, 
in part, to the relentless frequency of drug arrests. Social 
distancing orders exacerbated already-senseless barriers 
to services, causing a surge in overdose deaths. 
12BLACK PEOPLE IN THE U.S.  
ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY 
TO BE ARRESTED FOR DRUGS 
THAN WHITE PEOPLE,  
DESPITE USING DRUGS  
AT THE SAME RATE. 12 13Meanwhile, the uprisings against state violence amplified 
calls for groundbreaking legislation to disrupt the system 
of incarceration and policing, and invest in non-punitive 
alternatives.
Measure 110 is a powerful mandate to treat drug use as a 
health issue and not a criminal problem, and it’s just the 
beginning. Like with marijuana legalization, DPA will work 
to ensure this victory sets off a cascade of other efforts 
across the country. We are now focusing on our national 
strategy to run similar ballot initiative and legislative 
campaigns in states from Vermont to California and even 
in Congress. 
At the federal level, we have developed and released a 
proposed decriminalization framework, The Drug Policy 
Reform Act, the provisions of which have been included in 
the Movement for Black Lives’ BREATHE Act. This model 
framework eliminates criminal penalties for possession of 
small amounts of controlled substances, and shifts federal 
resources away from futile enforcement strategies to 
supportive initiatives to protect public health and safety.
13At the local level, many district attorneys have declined to 
prosecute drug possession charges during the pandemic. 
We are now looking to make those changes permanent, 
as well as advancing voter referendums or municipal 
resolutions to make drug possession the lowest law 
enforcement priority.
In December 2020, we reached another major milestone 
in undoing the harms of criminalization. After years 
of DPA working alongside advocates and formerly 
incarcerated people, Congress passed an omnibus 
spending package that included provisions to eliminate 
the question about prior drug convictions on the Free 
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form that 
students must complete to obtain financial aid for higher 
education, and to restore Pell Grants for incarcerated 
students. Providing educational opportunities to the 
71 million Americans with criminal convictions leads to 
higher incomes, reduces poverty, and improves quality of 
life for people who are incarcerated.It’s time to stop criminalizing people for drug possession  
and instead shift to a health-based approach.14 15“
“I was arrested for possession of a small amount of 
cocaine in the early 90s. At the courthouse, I thought 
I would take a plea deal for three years of probation 
thinking ‘okay I’ll do three years of probation, pay the 
court costs, pay all my fines and I should be done.’  
But that wasn’t the case. This has followed me for over 
two and a half decades. 
I’m a grandfather. I’m a father. I love my kids. I haven’t 
used drugs since ‘93. The conviction has kept me from 
getting housing, apartments, getting places near my kids. 
Now I have to travel three hours to see them.
And it has kept me from jobs. I tried to become a drug 
and alcohol counselor but was denied a license. I tried 
to become a phlebotomist, and again, I was denied a 
license. One time I was working as a cook at Intel. I got a 
promotion. I got my own little kitchen to cook breakfast. 
Then they did a background check and next thing you INTERVIEW: BOBBY BYRD

Oregon who became a community organizer

NOT RUIN THEM.
know I’m getting escorted out the door because of that 
drug charge. It didn’t matter how long I had been at the 
company, how hard I worked, or how good I was at the job.
It makes me feel like I’m trapped, like somebody owns me 
or something. Before Measure 110, drug laws were the new 
Jim Crow, that’s why Black people are consistently arrested 
at a higher rate even though drug use is the same rate.
Our country’s approach to drugs is wrong. I hope our 
experience in Oregon inspires other states to stop 
criminalizing people and ruining lives.
I am so proud to have worked as an organizer for the 
Measure 110 campaign. Because we won, life will be 
better for generations of Oregonians. It was an honor to 
have been part of the team that made it happen.14 15
MEETING THE 
CHALLENGES OF 
AN OVERDOSE 
CRISIS WITHIN 
A PANDEMIC The overdose crisis has wrought devastation 
across the country for over a decade and 
has sadly shown signs of intensifying in 2020, 
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
15
WE NEED TO SAVE LIVES,  
NOT RUIN THEM.16 17As lockdowns and social distancing guidelines were 
instituted, people accessing substance use disorder 
treatment experienced serious disruptions to care – most 
agencies reduced treatment hours, and restricted or 
ended in-person services. Harm reduction providers were 
similarly impacted and were forced to find innovative 
ways to ensure that participants would still have access 
to sterile syringes and other equipment, as well as life-
saving naloxone.
As a result, many people who use drugs struggled with 
isolation, withdrawal, and a disrupted drug supply. These 
factors contributed to growing overdose deaths and other 
drug-related harms in 2020. And, as always with the 
drug war, these harms were – and are – felt most acutely 
by communities of color, low-income people, people 
with unstable housing, those with co-occurring mental 
health issues, and other groups already dealing with 
marginalization.
At the intersection of the pandemic and the overdose 
crisis, the senselessness and cruelty of the war on drugs 
have never been starker, and DPA’s obligation to the 
people we serve has never been more profound.That’s why we are fighting for a comprehensive shift 
in priorities. Resources currently invested in policing 
and criminalization must instead be spent on effective 
education, health and harm reduction services, and 
treatment programs. 
We want people who use drugs to have easy access to 
the help and the compassion that they deserve.
Expanding Access to Treatment and 
Harm Reduction
DPA is countering overdoses and other drug-related 
harms by supporting broad access to medications 
for addiction treatment (MAT), a critical overdose 
prevention measure by which people receive access 
to the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment – 
methadone and buprenorphine.
We have been developing cutting-edge policy 
proposals, educating legislators, and building 
support to remove senseless barriers to MAT access, 
particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We 
saw policies that we had long advocated for – such 
1616 17as expanding telehealth, increasing methadone take-
home doses, and removing barriers to buprenorphine 
– implemented across the country. We are urging 
policymakers to make these reforms permanent, and to 
loosen restrictions even further.
Alongside MAT, access to sterile syringes is one of 
the most essential components of an evidence-based 
approach to drug use, yet, in many states, sterile syringe 
access is far too limited, and people are still arrested for 
syringe possession. This can result in sharing or reusing 
of syringes – which in turn leads to increases in HIV and 
hepatitis C infection.
In California, we successfully campaigned to extend a 
syringe access program, which allows the possession of 
syringes for personal use and for pharmacists to provide 
syringes without a prescription. In New York, we have 
increased our pressure on Gov. Cuomo to act immediately to decriminalize syringes, and to stop withholding harm 
reduction funds in the state. 
We engaged with harm reduction providers around the 
country to gather information on how the pandemic and 
economic downturn were hurting their services and 
participants. We then organized the harm reduction 
community behind a public letter which called for 
increased funding for syringe services programs. Our 
advocacy efforts were successful, with Congress 
agreeing to boost funding for the programs by 30%. 
In the nation’s capital, the D.C. Council passed the 
Opioid Overdose Treatment and Prevention Omnibus 
Amendment Act of 2020. A major piece of this bill, that 
DPA advocated for, decriminalizes possession of drug 
paraphernalia for personal use and allows community-
based organizations to distribute desperately needed 
harm reduction supplies which were previously 
criminalized under D.C.’s strict paraphernalia laws.We want people who use drugs to have easy access to help,  
and the compassion that they deserve.
1718 19Building Power Among Allies to 
Prevent Overdose and Other Harms 
During COVID-19
In May, we launched a seven-part COVID-19 and drug 
policy discussion series to explore the intersection of the 
pandemic; the overdose epidemic; and the on-going crises 
in drug war policing, surveillance, and criminalization. 
These discussions brought together advocates and allies 
in the justice reform and harm reduction movements 
to discuss how we can sustain progress made during 
the pandemic, navigate obstacles, and use the current 
moment to be more aspirational with our policy agendas. 
DPA produced and disseminated a set of COVID-19 drug 
policy priorities to protect public health, individual rights, 
and the dignity and well-being of those in our communities 
who are most harmed by structural inequities. 7 webinars

18 19Reaching Teens at Home with  
Reality-Based Drug Education 
Young people have faced unique challenges during 
the pandemic, dealing with many of the same stresses 
as their parents but without as much experience in 
emotional resiliency. They or their family members may 
be turning to alcohol or other drug use to help cope while 
remote work and school life became a reality.
We adapted our curriculum, Safety First: Real Drug 
Education for Teens, for distance learning during the 
pandemic. Safety First is a comprehensive tool for 
teachers that allows them to have honest conversations 
about drugs with their students, equipping them with the 
skills to navigate their risks. The goal of the curriculum is 
to empower students to make safer and healthier choices 
about alcohol and other drugs. It helps young people 
access and evaluate information, which can inform their 
behavior and understand the impacts of drug policies.The newly modified curriculum is Google Classroom-
compatible and allows for asynchronous online learning, 
containing student-directed lessons that help them 
identify and respond to the harms of alcohol and other 
drugs as well as how to manage and assess their mental 
health needs. We are now encouraging educators around 
the country to incorporate the curriculum into their online 
teaching, while also seeking to provide personalized 
support to school districts in New York City, Santa Fe, 
and San Francisco to train teachers.
In 2020, over 1,400 people 
downloaded the original  
Safety First curriculum, 
with nearly 600 more 
downloading the distance 
learning version.20 21
AN EQUITABLE 
APPROACH TO 
MARIJUANA  
LEGALIZATIONIt was one of DPA’s most successful years 
for marijuana reform, with groundbreaking 
victories at the state and federal level. We made 
history by getting legislation passed in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to deschedule 
marijuana and begin to repair the harms of its 
prohibition. We helped expand the number of 
states that have legalized marijuana to 15, and 
established access to medical marijuana in 
some of the places hardest hit by the drug war.
2020 21On the medical marijuana front, voters in South Dakota 
passed a measure to create safe, regulated, and legal 
access for patients. Meanwhile, after a multiyear effort by 
Drug Policy Action and our partners, Mississippi became 
the second state in the Deep South to legalize medical 
marijuana.
With the power of these wins, there is considerable 
momentum behind DPA’s campaigns to legalize marijuana in 
New York and New Mexico. Having successfully persuaded 
Gov. Cuomo and Gov. Lujan Grisham to endorse legalization, 
we are now campaigning to ensure legislative passage in 
both states in 2021.
Of the four states that legalized in 2020, only one is a 
traditionally deep blue state. It has become clear that adult-
use legalization is now viable in politically conservative 
regions, and we expect to see the dominos continue to 
fall in future election cycles and legislative sessions. 
Moreover, after this election, there are now eight more 
U.S. Senators whose constituents have spoken on this 
issue, and politicians would do well to remember that their 
constituents’ support for marijuana likely exceeds support 
for their reelection.
Driving Legalization at the State Level*
On Election Day, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota 
legalized marijuana for adult-use with the support of  
Drug Policy Action, and we applaud our allies who helped 
make it happen in Arizona. These victories will go a long 
way to undoing the harms of marijuana prohibition.  
In New Jersey, for example, where DPA worked for nearly 
20 years, the case for legalization was particularly  
powerful – police there made more than 32,000  
arrests a year for marijuana, the vast majority just for 
simple possession and disproportionately targeting 
people of color, at a cost of $143 million annually.

Federal Progress on Legalization
In December 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and 
Expungement (MORE) Act (H.R. 3884). This is the first 
piece of comprehensive marijuana reform legislation that 
deschedules marijuana – and the only one centered in 
reparative justice – to pass either chamber of Congress. 
DPA worked tirelessly to move the MORE Act forward 
since its inception. We worked with House Judiciary 
Chairman Jerry Nadler and then-Senator Kamala Harris 
to draft and introduce the legislation, and created the 
Marijuana Justice Coalition to build widespread support.
The House’s passage of the MORE Act was a powerful 
step forward to address the shameful legacy caused 
by marijuana prohibition across the country. Getting to 
this point gives us hope, but the fight is far from over. 
The legislation as passed is imperfect, as it includes 
provisions which would potentially exclude people with 
prior felony marijuana convictions from fully participating 
in the legal marijuana marketplace. It also includes 
language that carves out eligibility for resentencing and 
expungement relief pursuant to the bill, narrowing this relief to only nonviolent marijuana offenses and excluding 
individuals labeled as “kingpins” from expungement relief. 
DPA is committed to working with Congress to remove these 
exclusionary provisions and pass a bill in both the House and 
the Senate that more aligns with our principles. We demand 
more until our communities have the world they deserve.
One in three Americans now live in a state where marijuana 
is legal for adult use. And yet, after all these years and all 
our victories, the fact remains that one person is arrested 
nearly every minute in the United States for marijuana 
possession.
The criminalization of marijuana remains a cornerstone 
of the racist war on drugs, allowing law enforcement to 
disproportionately target people of color – even in states that 
have already legalized. For example, in Washington state, 
disparities between arrests of Black and white adults for 
selling marijuana has more than doubled since legalization.
DPA’s work will not be done until no one is ever arrested 
for marijuana, or any other drug, and until the damages 
of prohibition are repaired through expungement and 
reinvestment in communities harmed by racially targeted 
policing. 
2222 23 “What were some of the most promising 
international drug policy developments in 2020?
The consolidation of drug policy reform through ballot initiatives in the 
United States, especially the decriminalization of drug possession in 
Oregon, have been particularly promising. The fact that all drug policy 
reform initiatives passed in November, despite taking place during 
a highly polarized election, speaks of an emerging new consensus – 
which is very important given the role of the U.S. in global drug policy.
I was also excited to see international NGOs and academics – 
including Transform in the U.K., and Acción Técnica Social (ATS) 
in Colombia – produce research and guidance on how to regulate 
stimulant drugs, such as cocaine. I believe the future of research in 
this area is of crucial importance.Alejandro Madrazo is a Drug Policy Alliance

“A LOOK AT INTERNATIONAL DRUG POLICY
INTERVIEW: PROFESSOR  
ALEJANDRO MADRAZO24 25How is Mexico’s marijuana policy 
changing?
There have been many changes in Mexico’s marijuana 
policy in recent years, although few have been 
substantive enough to alter the true nature of prohibition.
In 2015, the Supreme Court declared that marijuana 
prohibition is unconstitutional. Then, in 2017, Congress 
legalized marijuana for medical use. In 2020, the Senate 
approved marijuana regulation for personal use, and that 
bill is expected to be ratified by the House in Spring 2021. 
However, in reality, little has improved for people affected 
by marijuana prohibition. The militarization of the drug 
war has deepened, violence has spiked again, and legal 
marijuana-based medicine remains expensive and its 
effectiveness has been artificially restricted. Despite the 
Supreme Court’s ruling, legal access to marijuana for 
personal use is limited only to people privileged enough 
to pay for a court injunction. 
The past few years have shown Mexicans legalizing is not 
enough – we must legalize right .What are you most concerned by right 
now in the global drug war?
I am concerned about commercialism in Mexico’s 
marijuana regulation model, which is in the process of 
being approved. The model keeps the drug war alive by 
creating a regulatory framework that excludes the people 
most affected by prohibition, while also concentrating 
financial benefits in large transnational companies. I also 
fear that that other countries may choose to replicate 
Mexico’s model.
How should the Biden Administration 
shift U.S. foreign policy to better 
address the drug war overseas?
American foreign policy and drug war discourse have 
enabled horrific human rights violations abroad, and 
entrenched these behaviors in other countries’ security 
apparatuses. Many allies of the U.S. – including the 
governments of the Philippines, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia – 
are killing and brutalizing people in the name of the drug 
war. The Biden Administration must closely monitor such 
developments and vocally oppose them when they occur.24 25Rapid Response Grants

MOVEMENT FOR FAMILY POWERMovement for Family Power (MFP) , co-founded by  
Erin Miles Cloud and Lisa Sangoi, works to end the foster 
system’s policing and punishment of families and to create a 
world where the dignity and integrity of all families is valued and 
supported. Drug Policy Alliance has been funding MFP since 
2019 – although, as MFP Co-Director Lisa Sangoi explains,  
her relationship with DPA goes back much further than that.

History of Partnership
As a young activist and agitator, much of my political 
grounding about the drug war came from DPA. DPA’s 
Reform Conferences helped me form a political moral 
compass. I learned that, if you’ve had substance use 
problems in your family, it can be very easy to buy 
into drug war propaganda. The process of being 
deprogrammed to all of it was a very liberating and 
informative experience. At Movement for Family Power, 
we see how the drug war plays out in the foster system 
and how it targets pregnant people and parents from 
marginalized communities.
Movement for Family Power was launched in 2018. 
When we mapped out organizations we wanted to build 
close relationships with, DPA was at the top of the list. 
We first worked together in a coalition of organizations 
to advance a bill in New York State to require medical 
care providers to seek the informed consent of pregnant 
people and new mothers before they or their babies are 
drug tested. DPA was able to provide us with funding 
and expertise on navigating the legislative terrain.Our partnership continued when we co-published our 
2020 report on the intersection of the child welfare and 
foster system and the drug war, Whatever They Do, I’m 
Her Comfort, I’m Her Protector: How the Foster System 
Has Become Ground Zero for the US Drug War . I had the 
research expertise but didn’t have the communications 
and public relations platform to amplify the report. DPA 
was able to help broaden our reach.
Supportive Partners in the Movement
Movement for Family Power is a new, small, grassroots 
organization. The Drug Policy Alliance is a much larger 
and more established organization. Our relationship with 
DPA is a good example of how big institutions can show 
up and fund smaller organizations in an ethical and loving 
way. There’s a tendency for large organizations to swallow 
up the work of smaller partners. DPA is not doing that.28 29
