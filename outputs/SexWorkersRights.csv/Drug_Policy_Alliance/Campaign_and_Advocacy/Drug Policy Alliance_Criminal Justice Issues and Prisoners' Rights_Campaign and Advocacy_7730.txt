Blige, activists Reverend Jesse Jackson, Gloria Steinem, Michelle Alexander and Neill Franklin of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), as well as distinguished legislators, cabinet ministers, and former UN officials.See the full list of signatories.View the newspaper.Criminal Justice ReformDrug War SolutionsHarm ReductionReforming Marijuana LawsLetterFeatured ResourcesEnd No-Knock Warrants and Militarized Quick-Knock RaidsDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemMember NewsletterMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release10.13.22Civil Rights Groups, Policy Experts Welcome Sen.
