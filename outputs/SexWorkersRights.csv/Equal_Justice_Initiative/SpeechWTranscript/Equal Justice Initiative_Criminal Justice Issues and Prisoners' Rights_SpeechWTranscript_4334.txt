CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear
 
argument next today in Case 17-7505, Madison
 
versus Alabama.
 
Mr. Stevenson.
 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON
 
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 
MR. STEVENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, may
 
it please the Court:
 
It's undisputed that Vernon Madison
 
now sits on Alabama's death row, unable to
 fully orient to time and place. As a result of
 several strokes, he suffers from acute vascular
 dementia, which has left his cognitive
 abilities greatly diminished. He now has
 intellectual functioning in the borderline
 range. He has a memory score of 58. And these
 severe disabilities have rendered him
 bewildered and confused most of the time.
 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stevenson,
 
I'm -- it's a question for both sides, but I'm
 having trouble with a firm grasp on exactly
 what issues are presented.
 
Now just tell me if I've got this

right: There are two. The first one, I would
 
say, is, does someone who doesn't remember the
 details of their crime, can he satisfy Ford and
 Panetti simply on that basis? He knows what
 capital punishment is, he knows what's going to
 happen; he just doesn't remember what -- what
 he did.
 
And the second one is whether or not
 
vascular dementia can be a basis for a Ford
 claim. In other words, he meets the Ford
 standard, but it's not caused by insanity; it's
 called by -- caused by dementia. Now am I
 right that those are the two separate
 questions?
 
MR. STEVENSON: I -- I -- I think
 
they're two related questions. And the only -­I think what we would argue is that that first
 question is that, yes, memory loss, with some
 -- something else can render someone
 incompetent, and that something else may not be
 dementia -- that is, someone who has a brain
 injury and is now impaired in a way where they
 have no memory of anything, it's not vascular
 dementia -- could also be incompetent to be
 executed, someone who is actually in a coma.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say must be
 
memory loss plus? And what would the plus be?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Well, the -- the
 
examples that come to mind would be the kind of
 brain damage that is a result of an injury,
 where the brain is injured and incapable of
 actually producing memories or creating the
 kind of rational understanding that this Court
 has required.
 
A second example would be something
 
like a coma. We would argue that someone who
 is in a coma is not competent to be executed
 because their state of mind would not be
 reconcilable to what this Court has held in
 Ford and Panetti.
 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stevenson,
 
part of the problem is the use of the word
 "loss of memory." And I -- in your briefs, you
 seem to go back and forth on this.
 
Are you conceding that amnesia about
 
the incident alone, where you can function in
 every other way in society, would you be
 incompetent then?
 
MR. STEVENSON: No.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To be executed?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yes, that's right. We
 
-- we do not contend -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your loss of
 
memory isn't even what the cause of the loss of
 memory is. If this person who has amnesia can
 no longer function because they can't even
 remember how to eat or how to go to the
 bathroom or how to think about a problem or et
 cetera, you would say the cause is not what's
 important; it's whether their cognitive
 deficiencies cause what? Now fill in the
 blank.
 
MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's right.
 
Would cause disorientation, cause an inability
 to understand their circumstances, have the
 kind of symptoms that we have here.
 Mr. Madison can't tell you the season of the
 year. He can't tell you the month of the year.
 He can't tell you the day of the week. He
 can't recite the alphabet past G. He can't -­

Justice Sotomayor's question. If a person -­
if -- if a person simply is without memory of
 his commission of the capital offense, does
 that in itself render that person incompetent
 to be executed?
 
MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think it could.
 
But I think the reason why I qualify it is
 because there aren't circumstances that I
 believe are consistent with what we've argued
 here.
 
JUSTICE ALITO: No, I think that's a
 
-- a question that calls for a yes or no
 answer. If the only thing that is lacking is
 memory of the commission of the capital
 offense, does that in itself render the person
 incompetent to be executed?
 
MR. STEVENSON: I think it would
 
render someone incompetent if the basis for
 that inability to remember is medical rather
 than something else. And here what we've
 argued is that we're -­

MR. STEVENSON: That's correct. 
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- of his commission 
of the capital offense. So do I take you now 
to be saying that if you are left without
 
memory of the commission of the capital offense
 for some reason that doesn't have something to
 do with mental disability, that's not enough?
 
MR. STEVENSON: I -- I'm just -­JUSTICE KAGAN: But if there's mental
 
disability that has given rise to this lack of
 memory, then it is?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Well, I guess what I'm
 
conceding, Justice Kagan, is that we're arguing
 that more is required than someone saying I
 don't remember my crime, you can't execute me.
 The state has an interest in being able to
 impose punishment and to execute these kinds of
 sentences with something more than "I don't
 remember." We've never argued that.
 
JUSTICE ALITO: No, I don't understand
 
-- I don't understand your answer. I don't -­I can't think of a situation in which a person
 would lack memory of the commission of the
 offense without that being based on a mental
 condition.

MR. STEVENSON: Well, that's correct. 
That's -­
JUSTICE ALITO: By definition, it's a 
mental condition. 
MR. STEVENSON: That -- well, that's 
my point, Justice Alito. We're arguing that it
 
would have to be accompanied by some mental
 disability. And here we argued that that
 disability was dementia.
 
And the reason why I'm stressing that
 
is because you can't understand the nature of
 that memory loss, you can't rely on it as a
 credible basis for concluding that someone is
 incompetent to be executed, until you
 understand how that's possible.
 
And that's the only point I'm making,
 
is that without something to look to -­
JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. I suppose what
 
people are thinking of, and I'm -- I'm not even
 sure if this happens ever or whether there's
 any sort of physiology behind this, but the
 idea of a kind of fugue state or a blackout
 that's unaccompanied by anything else, does
 that count as the kind of mental disability

MR. STEVENSON: No, it is not. It
 
does not. We're not arguing that someone who
 
is competent to stand trial, who nonetheless at
 trial maintains that they blacked out or don't
 remember would, therefore, be incompetent to be
 executed. What we're arguing is something
 quite different.
 
Here, we know that Mr. Madison's brain
 
is damaged. We can see it on an MRI. We know
 that his cognitive disabilities have declined.
 We know that he is not able to understand the
 things going on around him.
 
And we argued that, because of that
 
dementia, which has very particular features,
 he is incompetent to be executed. The trial
 court found that because he's not insane and
 because he's not psychotic, there is no remedy
 in the law for him. And it's on that basis
 that the trial court ruled against us.
 
Now it's significant that in this
 
Court -- and the state argued below that
 incompetency to be executed can only be
 established where there's a showing of
 insanity, delusion, or psychosis.
 
In this Court, the state has taken a

dementia can be a basis on which -­

Yeah. And that's what's -- that's what strikes

 are two questions. You concede on one, and the

just can't remember the crime. You know that
 you're going to be executed because you
 committed a crime, but you don't remember
 anything about it. I understand you to be
 saying that's not enough.

if, in fact, you meet the Ford standards, they
 
don't care how you got there; if you got there
 because you have dementia, you still meet the
 Ford standards.
 
MR. STEVENSON: Well, but that's a
 
very different position than what we argued
 below, because that was our argument, is that
 we can meet the Ford standards when you
 consider dementia as a legitimate basis for
 rendering someone incompetent. And none of the
 fact findings were made through that lens.
 
And I think on the first question,
 
what I'm arguing is that we recognize that it's
 too easy for any offender to say "I don't
 remember." Defendants at trial often use
 defenses of "I don't remember." It doesn't
 preclude the state from trying them, from
 convicting them, from sentencing them.
 
It doesn't make them incompetent.
 
But, when you have the kind of disorder that
 Mr. Madison has and he has no ability to
 remember anything about the circumstances of
 the offense, he cannot put himself in that
 situation, then we argue that there is a
 legitimate basis for arguing that that person

that aside for the moment, how would I define
 severe dementia?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the
 
difference between mild dementia, moderate, and
 severe?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And where would
 
the fact-finder settle in saying this person is
 incompetent or not incompetent?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yes. And that's where
 
the medical community has helped us a lot, that
 science has -- has emerged and evolved quite a
 bit. Under the DSM-5, there are requirements
 for moving someone from possible dementia,
 which we would argue would not be sufficient to
 render someone incompetent to be executed, just
 the allegation, some limited memory deficits.
 
Moving someone from possible dementia
 
to probable dementia requires four things.

 see a damage to the brain. That's one of the

memory scores have dropped dramatically.
 
And what the DSM-5 requires is some
 
etiology, something that we can point to that
 
helps us understand the maturation of this
 disease so that it's not early stage but late
 stage.
 
And here, of course, you have two
 
life-threatening strokes where he almost died
 and there were brain injuries. He now has
 cerebral vascular disease that we can see.
 
So, under those circumstances -- and I
 
-- I concede that there are going to be harder
 cases, there could be harder cases, but under
 these circumstances, the evidence is quite
 dramatic.
 
There was no dispute that Mr. Madison
 
suffers from severe vascular dementia using the
 criteria that the medical community has given
 to us about these kinds of diseases, which is
 why the state's concession that dementia could
 be a basis is so significant.
 
What we wanted to prove to the judge
 
below is that dementia, when it has these
 features, renders someone incompetent. And the
 perfect example comes from the record.

Mr. Madison can explain to you that he
 
has a toilet in his cell. It's a 5-by-8 cell.
 
He can explain to you that he can use that
 toilet. But he routinely urinates on himself
 and he gets frustrated because he's asking the
 guards to take him to the toilet.
 
He's not able to hold that memory of
 
the location of the toilet next to his bed when
 it's time for him to urinate, and so he
 continues to soil himself.

obviously has serious problems, serious
 physical problems and mental problems, but I am

 that he does not rationally understand the

 you what the death penalty is. He can tell you

 crime, he can repeat that back to you, but he
 has no independent knowledge of that.

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, he did not -- he
 
did not remember the crime. He did not
 
remember the victim.
 
MR. STEVENSON: Which -­JUSTICE ALITO: But he said he
 
understands the sentence, specifically the
 meaning of the death sentence. He understands
 the meaning of execution, and many details
 involved. He is able to understand the nature
 of the proceedings. He thinks he understands
 that what the state is seeking is retribution.
 He feels his conviction was unjust. He never
 went around killing folks.
 
MR. STEVENSON: Well, he didn't -- I
 
think what he said was I don't have any -- I
 don't think this applies to me. I never went
 around killing people. He wasn't able to
 actually make a judgment about his conviction
 because that memory wasn't with him.
 
And that's just what this Court dealt
 
with in Panetti. In Panetti, you had the same
 circumstance where you have someone who was a
 delusional but could tell you what murder is,

 circumstance, and to Ford and Panetti, you will
 have to conclude that this man is not competent
 to be executed.

argument of the state is say that we failed
 
because we did not make a threshold showing of
 insanity. We did not show delusions. The
 trial court's order in this case starts with
 our failure to show that he is delusional, and
 ends with our failure to show that he's
 delusional.
 
We never suggested that we could prove
 
that he is delusional. What we argued is that
 his dementia renders him incompetent in a way
 that does not permit the state, consistent with
 the Eighth Amendment, to carry out this
 execution.
 
And because dementia changes the
 
interpretation of these facts, as I was -- as I
 was arguing, you can tell Mr. Madison that he
 was convicted in Mobile, that this was the
 crime, this was the circumstance. He can hold
 onto that. But the next day, the next week,
 he's not going to have that memory. And that
 deprives him of the kind of rational
 understanding this Court talked about as being
 critical in Ford and Panetti.

tell me which one you're arguing?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Sure.
 
JUSTICE KAGAN: Or maybe you can tell
 
me that there's no difference -­
MR. STEVENSON: Sure.
 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- between the two.
 
So one is just if you have severe dementia, you
 are incompetent to be executed. That's simple.
 
The other is if you have severe
 
dementia, you are likely also to have a lack of
 rational understanding of the kind we talked
 about in Panetti.
 
So, in other words, the dementia would
 
be the -- the -- the -- the physiological
 reason, but the standard would still be the
 Panetti standard.
 
MR. STEVENSON: I -- I -- I think it's
 
the latter, Justice Kagan. We're not -- we're
 not arguing that just the mere proof of severe
 dementia alone would satisfy the Eighth
 Amendment because there are dementia sufferers
 whose long-term memory is actually pretty
 secured, pretty well intact.
 
They -- they -- they struggle mostly
 
with short-term memory. And the nature of that

struggle might allow them to hold onto these
 
long-term memories in a way that they would
 have a rational understanding of these
 circumstances.
 
I don't think this is an area where
 
there can be the kind of clarity of category or
 offense that would allow this Court to say
 those people are incompetent, these people are
 not. And that's what this Court was dealing
 with in Ford and Panetti.
 
JUSTICE BREYER: So what -- what then
 
-- as -- as probably you know, I think, that
 there are many, many, many prisoners on death
 row under threat of execution who are in their
 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, possibly 80s, who have been
 there for 20, 30, 40 years perhaps. So this
 will become a more common problem.
 
The standard used in Ford is -- the
 
word they often use is insane. All right? In
 Panetti, the word they use, he has no
 comprehension of why he has been singled out.
 All right?
 
If you are writing this standard for
 
the situation I described, what words would you
 use? What's the sentence that you believe

should be seen in the U.S. reports in this -­
but on a problem that I think is general?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yeah, if I can just
 
first contextualize that problem before giving
 that answer. I mean, I -- I -- I don't think
 that the age of the offender is a predictor of
 the scale of this phenomena, at least based on
 what we're talking about here.
 
And this was an issue that came up in
 
Ford, where there was a real concern about the
 flood gates. And we put a footnote in our
 brief about the incidence, how frequently
 competency to be executed -- competency to be
 executed claims are raised. And it's actually
 relatively infrequent, Justice Breyer.
 Ninety-three percent of the 1300 people who
 have gotten execution dates over the last 30
 years did not raise a competency to be executed
 claim, even though many of them were older than
 Mr. Madison.
 
Mr. Madison's problems are -- are
 
cerebrovascular, which, of course, can happen
 at any age.

 case, or you answer what I -- I mean -­
MR. STEVENSON: Yes, that's right.
 
The rule I -- I would argue is that where
 someone has a disability that renders them
 incapable of orienting to time or place or
 rationally understanding the circumstances of
 their offense, they are incompetent. And there
 has been no reliable determination of rational
 understanding of the circumstances here,
 because the court was unwilling to consider any
 evidence about that mental state that was
 outside the scope of insanity, delusion, or
 psychosis.
 
And we think, as the Eleventh Circuit
 
did, when you accept dementia as a relevant
 basis for coming to that conclusion, the
 Eleventh Circuit had no difficulty finding that

he's clearly incompetent. Even the dissenting
 
judge starts his dissent "Mr. Madison is
 clearly incompetent."
 
JUSTICE ALITO: When you back -- when
 
you went back to the trial court, you
 emphasized the events concerning Kirkwood.
 What is his situation now?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Dr. Kirkland has been
 
suspended. He is no longer a practicing
 psychology -- a psychologist. He is under
 threat of criminal prosecution.
 
JUSTICE ALITO: Did the grand jury
 
refuse to return a true bill for him?
 
MR. STEVENSON: They did at one point.
 
But he is still under investigation, still
 suspended. 
JUSTICE ALITO: He's still under 
investigation by whom? 
MR. STEVENSON: By the State of 
Alabama. There are multiple counties involved
 in the circumstances that gave rise to this.
 And our only point with that, Justice Alito, is
 that the -- the court relied so heavily on this
 conclusion that we didn't think was supported
 by the record, that we -- we thought that it

was relevant that Dr. Kirkland's reliability be
 
addressed.
 
But our broad point was that, given
 
what we know about dementia, given that if you
 apply dementia to these facts and
 circumstances, the trial court would have to
 conclude, like the Eleventh Circuit did, that
 Mr. Madison is incompetent.
 
The state argued that you can't do
 
that in trial court; you can only find
 incompetency if there's psychosis or insanity
 or delusions. And that was the basis on the
 trial court's rejection of our argument.
 
And I don't think it's too difficult
 
to articulate this concept of -- of
 incompetency that relates to rational
 understanding, orientation, disorientation, is
 a key factor. And that's for me perhaps useful
 for a court to articulate because, in a lot of
 ways, your inability to orient to time and
 place is going to undermine your ability to
 rationally understand what's going on.
 
And that's a fairly well-developed
 
area of the medical profession. It's what -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with the
 
determination -- what do you do with the
 determination that, one, he knew that he was
 subject to execution for having killed a police
 officer?
 
MR. STEVENSON: I -- I'd -- I would
 
deal with that the same way the Court dealt
 with that in Panetti. The abstract
 understanding that someone who's convicted of a
 murder can be executed does not help resolve
 the question of whether this defendant has a
 rational understanding of his circumstances.
 
And the example that I use is a common
 
one, common problem you see in dementia. When
 someone goes to see their mother and their
 mother doesn't recognize them, it's
 heartbreaking. It's devastating. Once you
 understand that the reason why they can't
 recognize you is dementia, you have a different
 relation -- relationship to what that means.
 
You can say I'm your daughter, and
 
that person will respond to you as their
 daughter. But, when you come back the next

day, they don't have a rational understanding
 
of who you are.
 
And what the trial court and what the
 
state has argued is essentially, if we can get
 the patient to say, yes, that's my daughter, we
 can conclude that they have a rational
 understanding of their circumstances, of their
 family.
 
And that's the tragedy of dementia.
 
You can't sustain that understanding. And
 that's where the orientation to time and place
 becomes critical.
 
Now there are other circumstances. I
 
-- I just wanted to be clear that we're not
 contending that this should be an unworkable
 standard for states, that someone saying "I
 don't remember" is sufficient.
 
I think here there was a very key -­
clear case. No one disputes the severity of
 his mental and physical decline, his
 disabilities. He's legally blind now. He
 can't speak without slurring his speech. He's
 incontinent. He can't walk without assistance.
 Everyone, including the trial court, observed
 that he is a very severely ill person.

decline. And, of course, the circumstances
 that he is in add to that decline. He's locked
 in a 5-by-8 cell. He's been in solitary
 confinement for 33 years. He is in pain.
 There isn't the kind of medical care that he
 might otherwise get.
 
So there's no question, and -- and
 
Dr. Goff was very clear about this, and the
 APA's brief makes this clear, that his
 condition will continue to degenerate and his
 ability to function will diminish as well.
 
But the point -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stevenson, the
 
court below believed that Dr. Kirkland and
 Goff's evaluations were essentially similar.

MR. STEVENSON: Sure.
 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in order to
 
deal with that?
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yeah. Okay. Well, I
 
think the primary difference is that
 Dr. Kirkland in no way was willing to
 acknowledge dementia as relevant to his
 evaluation. So his fact-findings about what
 the patient remembers were made without any
 context or any understanding of dementia as
 relevant to that.
 
Dr. Goff, on the other hand, said you
 
cannot find that Mr. Madison has any
 independent recollection of the crime, the
 circumstances, the events that led to his
 arrest. Dr. Goff made the finding that he
 doesn't understand from day to day what's
 happening, that he's disoriented, that he's
 bewildered. None of those findings were found
 by Dr. Kirkland.
 
And so Dr. Goff's evaluation, of
 
course, was that he would not be competent to
 be executed when you consider these medical
 facts. And Dr. Kirkland, the trial judge, nor
 the state ever acknowledged dementia as

MR. GOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
 
it please the Court:
 
This Court granted certiorari on two
 
questions. With respect to the first question
 concerning whether the state may execute an
 offender who does not remember committing the
 capital offense, there is absolutely no
 objective evidence of a national consensus
 supporting such a rule, and Mr. Madison does
 not offer any evidence to the contrary.

reading through some of the materials that you
 
pointed to in your brief that, under the common
 law, there were different kinds of -- of
 defenses to murder, including lunacy. I see
 one of your sources, Cowell, and the other
 Hale, talking about lunacy being a condition
 unlike insanity, which they defined as never
 being in touch with reality. They define
 lunacy as being able to remember some things
 but not others.
 
And yet, to a source, the common law
 
excused lunatics, so that if states are folding
 in dementia into lunacy, into insanity, into
 other sort of broader labels just like the
 common law did, how can I rely on your
 statement that there's no consensus?
 
MR. GOVAN: Well, Your Honor -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't even know
 
that we have to get there because your
 adversary has said that he thinks this folds
 into Ford and Panetti because it's not dementia
 qua dementia; it's a certain kind of dementia
 that doesn't put you in rational touch with
 your decision-making in your moment. But,
 putting that aside, I -- I'm taking on your

starting proposition.
 
MR. GOVAN: Yes, Your Honor, for two
 
points. The first, just to address the common
 
law, is that, when we look back at the common
 law, they were addressing something different,
 where someone has completely lost his wits.
 We're talking about absolute madness.
 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, they define
 
lunacy as someone who can remember sometimes
 and not remember -- have his wits sometime and
 not have his wits other times.
 
MR. GOVAN: Well, Your Honor, our -­
our view of the common law, and those sources,
 we're talking about something different. Not
 remembering the offense would not fit into
 those categories of someone -- absolute madness
 or -- or losing their wits.
 
And the second point -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if you don't
 
think a demented person who today doesn't
 remember you as your son, who doesn't know
 where he or she is, who doesn't know to call -­to go to the bathroom in the pot right next to
 him. You don't call that being out of your

 they within their wits?

not -- there -- there could be -- again,
 dementia exists on a spectrum. So there's no

 that's not what we have here.
 
And that's -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you

 because somebody doesn't remember the crime,

MR. GOVAN: Yes, yes, if someone has
 
vascular dementia or any other mental illness,
 
if it precludes them from having a rational
 understanding of their punishment, and that
 they will die when they're executed, they would
 meet the Ford and Panetti standard.
 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so I
 
understand your friend who have conceded that
 simply not remembering the crime is not enough.
 And you're arguing that if it's vascular
 dementia that affects you up to the point of
 Ford and Panetti, that that is enough.

-- that doesn't change the scenario. And we
 
have to explain the context that that occurred.
 That was just a summary denial in the exact
 same case.
 
After this Court summarily reversed
 
the Eleventh Circuit, the Alabama Supreme Court
 set Madison's execution date again. What Mr.
 Madison did is he filed another petition of the
 same Alabama statute that uses that term
 "insanity" -- that's why that term was used -­alleging the exact same evidence that he
 presented to the trial court, the same trial
 court judge in 2016, which had previously
 rejected.
 
That court held a hearing in 2018 and
 
essentially asked Madison: Do you have
 anything else new to present? And Mr. Madison
 said: No. And on page 12 of that hearing
 transcript, Mr. Madison said -- Mr. Madison
 said: We are obviously relying on the evidence
 that was previously before the court.
 
And so, when the court was presented
 
with that same evidence, he said this Court,
 the Supreme Court has already said -­

understands that insanity is not a sine qua
 non, that dementia could do the trick in
 satisfying the Ford/Panetti standard?
 
Is there ever a place where the court
 
says, even though, you know, I understand that
 I'm not necessarily looking for delusions or
 schizophrenia or insanity and all the -- the
 ways that we -- that we saw it in Ford and
 Panetti, that if I find somebody who's
 experiencing the kind of dementia that would
 prevent him from having a rational
 understanding of the crime and punishment, that
 that's enough? Is there ever a place where the
 court makes clear that it knows that?
 
MR. GOVAN: Well, yes, several parts,
 
Your Honor. On page 3 and 4 of the court's
 order, the 2016 order, it set out the Panetti
 standard in full.
 
On page 10 of the court's order -­JUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't think that
 
that does it. I mean, you can set out the
 Panetti standard. The question is whether you
 understand that dementia can be the basis for
 satisfying the Ford and Panetti standard.

MR. GOVAN: Absolutely. On page 6
 
through 8 of that court's order, the trial
 
court specifically outlined Dr. Goff's
 testimony about that, including the fact that
 he had had strokes, that because of those
 strokes, he had had a loss, a memory loss, that
 he had cognitive decline.
 
He considered -­JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But if you're
 
just listing that evidence, what you might
 think as a court if you're looking for
 delusions, is that's all relevant, I'm listing
 the evidence, but that's irrelevant.
 
Is there ever a place where the court
 
makes it clear that that is relevant?
 
MR. GOVAN: Because it specifically
 
said in its conclusion on page 10 that it was
 considering all the testimony of Dr. Goff and
 that eventually made the final finding, which
 Justice Alito pointed to, that "Madison has a
 rational understanding as required by Panetti
 that he is going to be executed."

mean, Mr. Govan? And I won't belabor this, but
 
you can list all the evidence and think to
 yourself: I'm listing all the evidence, but I
 find all this evidence utterly irrelevant to
 the legal standard because I think delusions
 are required to satisfy Ford and Panetti.
 
MR. GOVAN: Well, I understand, Your
 
Honor. I guess the point is that the judge
 never made that finding. There's no point in
 the judge's order where it said: I hear this
 evidence from Madison's expert, but I can't
 consider it. That was never in the order.
 
The judge never said that I'm denying
 
his competency petition because he doesn't have
 a delusion. That's -- that's what my friend
 has argued below, but that's not consistent -­
JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess what you're
 
saying is either way. We -- we can't tell
 either way whether -- is that what you're
 saying?

tell that he thought that delusions were
 required, and we can't tell that -- whether he
 thought that dementia could satisfy?

MR. GOVAN: No, that's not what we're
 
saying at all. We're saying, number one, that
 
he did consider all this evidence presented by
 Dr. Goff. And, number two, there is not a
 single point that Madison can point to where
 the trial court said: I can't consider this
 evidence. That just does not appear in the
 record.
 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess -­JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think?
 
That is, what does the state think about the
 standard, which perhaps would be an addition to
 Ford or Panetti, which was mentioned, if the
 two -- and it's not exclusive, but if two
 things are true; one, he does not recall his
 crime; and, second, he has a severe inability
 to orient himself to time or place, which means
 the kinds of things that were described.
 
Yes, I recognize you today; tomorrow I

Panetti, is there a -- would you accept the
 
fact that such a person cannot be executed
 under the Eighth Amendment? And, if not,
 what's the difference?
 
MR. GOVAN: Your Honor, the difference
 
is -- is that, under Ford and Panetti, Madison
 has an understanding of what matters.
 
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I'm not
 
saying -- I understand that the words I just
 used are different than Ford and Panetti, but a
 person in that circumstance either can be
 executed or not. That would be perhaps a new
 standard or a modification of Ford and Panetti.
 
So I want to know if you think such a
 
person can be executed and what your objection
 is to adding the words I just said as an
 additional standard, if you like, or a

one, Your Honor. Not remembering the crime,

the reason it's fallen out is because there's
 such a clear lack of objective evidence for
 such a rule.

MR. GOVAN: Your Honor, because, in
 
this case, the state would still have a strong
 
interest in seeking retribution for a horrible
 crime. If someone -- even if they can't

 Panetti, the fact that he got there through
 vascular dementia, I understand you to say that
 doesn't make a difference. That still
 qualifies.

 vascular dementia or any other type of mental
 illness, that would just be the starting point.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. In
 
Panetti, the man understood that the -- that he
 
was in jail, that the state was charging him
 with a crime, that it was going to put him to
 death. He believed they wouldn't, because of
 his delusions, ultimately succeed, but he
 understood perfectly well that set of facts.
 And we said that still qualified him.
 
So we have a man here who knows that
 
he's incarcerated or kept in a cage because
 he's in a bed, he can't move on his own, can't
 remember where the bathroom is next to him,
 can't see, slurs his words. He's really not
 quite there. But he knows that someone says he
 committed a murder and that they're trying to
 kill him, but he doesn't understand why. He
 can't be present enough in time to rationally
 understand or reflect on what he has done
 because he can't retain information for long.
 And why is that different than Panetti?
 
In Panetti, the man was blaming
 
someone else, which may be even worse for some
 people, or saying that someone else is going to

appreciate why you're putting -- being put to
 
death, how does that fulfill the Panetti
 standard?
 
MR. GOVAN: Your Honor, because this
 
case is different than the facts of Panetti.
 So, in Panetti, the problem was the inmate knew
 he was going to be executed, but he didn't
 understand why. He believed that the reason he
 was going to be executed was because it was a
 -- a sham to get him from -- stop preaching.
 There is no confusion from Mr. Madison's
 perspective. His own expert said that, quote,
 and this is on page 7 of his report, "he
 understands the sentence, specifically the
 meaning of a death sentence." And he said,
 quote, that "Madison said the reason he was in
 prison was because of murder."
 
And that -- and that's the difference
 
here in this particular case, is that his own
 expert admitted -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what if he
 
can't understand or really follow through in
 his thinking what that means? I mean, he's
 just not rational in the way you and I
 understand it.

 would let them buy an apartment in Florida the

 do after this case ended.
 
MR. GOVAN: Well, Your Honor, with
 
respect, on the things that matter, he does
 understand. And we haven't talked all the
 things that he -- he does recall both before
 and after the offense.
 
He remembers that he was convicted of
 
multiple juvenile offenses and sent -- spent
 time in a youth detention facility. He
 remembers that -­

ask you whether you think this is at all
 relevant? At the time of the conviction, over
 30 years ago, Madison was competent. There was
 no doubt about that. But I think this -­wasn't this a case of a judge overriding a jury
 recommendation against death in -- in Madison's
 case?

MR. GOVAN: Yes, Your Honor.
 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So suppose he had
 
come to that, the end of the trial, in the
 condition he now is in; that is, he can't see,
 he can barely walk, all of the other conditions
 that Mr. Stevenson brought out. Is there any
 likelihood that a jury would have recommended
 death for such a person or that a judge would
 override the jury's recommendation for life
 rather than death?
 
MR. GOVAN: Judge, I don't know. That
 
would be a situation that would -- would take
 place in a normal sentencing hearing to
 determine whether those mitigating
 circumstances -- aggravating circumstances
 outweigh the mitigators. But I would say what
 matters here is -- is that scenario would not
 impact the state's -- the constitutionality of
 seeking a death sentence or the -- the
 propriety of seeking a death sentence, which,
 again, nothing about Mr. Madison's conditions
 impact the state's interest in seeking
 retribution for a -- a heinous crime.

MR. GOVAN: That's correct, Your
 
Honor. That's correct. In fact, Panetti talks
 about something similar to that, that there
 could be other -- another category of inmates
 who, as a result of not mental illness, that
 they're recalcitrant, they're calloused, they

someone has a rational understanding. That's
 
something that is inherently going to come from
 talking with a particular inmate and
 particularly in this case, where the
 dispositive fact that Mr. Madison is relying on
 is that he can't remember the crime.
 
That's inherently something that only
 
comes from the defendant. And he would have to
 admit that, whether to a psychologist or in
 testimony. And that can't be the rule because,
 if that was the case, no inmate would ever
 admit to committing the crime if that meant
 that he were incompetent.
 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you -­
you've already prevailed on that point at least
 with respect to your adversary's view, right?
 
MR. GOVAN: Yes, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So I
 
would have thought we can stop arguing about
 it, but -- we don't have to -- we don't have to
 accept a concession, but the -- the concern
 about the MRI evidence is that it would, if I
 understand it, tend to show something that is
 going to have a broader effect than just not
 remembering the facts of the crime. Is -- is

that not right?
 
MR. GOVAN: Well, Your Honor, I think
 
MRI evidence can help. There is this
 
suggestion as far as the -- the diagnosing. So
 that certainly can -- can help with the
 individual fact determinations that a trial
 court would make.
 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but
 
there's no MRI evidence that's going to be
 looked at and you can say this shows that he
 doesn't remember the facts of the crime. That
 doesn't -- isn't going to have broader
 significance, right?
 
MR. GOVAN: That's correct. But,
 
again, in this -- in this case, of course, the
 trial court did consider -- and just in this
 particular case, did consider the fact that,
 according to Dr. Goff, this was a progressive
 disease. But, at the end of the day, the court
 held that there was a rational understanding.

determinations are done across the board at any
 
level, whether competency to stand trial,
 competency to be executed, competency to waive
 appeals. They all function the same way.
 
It's not the fact that someone comes
 
to the court and says to a trial court: Oh, I
 have a -- I have this particular mental illness
 and, therefore, I meet the competency standard.
 It would apply the exact same way it occurred
 here, that they -- that it would consider that
 evidence and determine whether they have a
 rational understanding. And that's what the
 trial court did here.
 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would think
 
that if he came before the trial court on a
 question of competence to stand trial with what
 his mental condition is now, his lack of
 orientation to time and place, that he would
 have been found competent to stand trial?
 
MR. GOVAN: Yes, Your Honor, I do,
 
because, again, he would have what the -- the
 rational understanding that would be required
 in even the competency to stand trial setting,
 which is the -- a rational understanding of the
 facts, the factual proceedings, and the ability

to assist with counsel.
 
And here that's what Madison's expert
 
said, that he did understand, quote, "he has
 
been able to understand the nature of the
 pending proceeding and he has an understanding
 of what he was tried for." So, yes.
 
JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and -- and what
 
if what they meant by that was you can -- you
 can make him understand what is going on today,
 but then tomorrow he comes back and you have to
 do it all over again, and then tomorrow -- the
 next day comes back and you have to do it all
 over again?
 
In other words, he -- you -- you can
 
-- you can -- you can get him to understand
 something, but then he loses it. That's -­because that's the way memory works with people
 in this -- with this form of dementia.
 
What about that?
 MR. GOVAN: Your Honor, that -- that
 
might be a closer question, again, that you
 would determine on the factual circumstances in
 front of that particular court. But, again,
 that -- that's not what we have here.
 
It was clear -- Mr. Madison said to

both experts that he remembered that he had
 
three separate trials, that he was convicted of
 a death sentence. He -- to both experts, he
 believed that he did not agree with the
 particular sentence.
 
So that's not what we have here in
 
this particular case because, as this Court
 noted before, both experts' testimony
 demonstrated that he did have a rational
 understanding of his particular sentence in
 this case.
 
Another point that would just need -­
I just want to harken back to, the -- the fact
 of -- we've talked about the original rule,
 that Madison in the first question presented,
 is that says there's just simply no objective
 evidence of a position supporting Madison's
 position, either under the first or second
 question presented.
 
No state legislature has determined
 
that prohibits states, of the 31 states that
 have the death penalty, has prohibited states
 from carrying out an execution for someone who
 has a mental illness or who cannot remember the

The lower courts are -- are uniform in
 
that respect in addressing competency as well,
 
and the Texas brief points that out in regards
 to competency to stand trial. And we point out
 in our brief that of the three states that have
 addressed an issue similar to this, they have
 all come down on Alabama's side, that simply
 having dementia and not remembering the facts
 of the crime does not prevent you per se from
 having a rational understanding.
 
So the final point I would just
 
mention to this Court is what, again, what
 Madison seeks is unprecedented. This Court has
 never created a categorical rule excluding
 someone from capital punishment, where at least
 there was some objective evidence of a national
 consensus in that direction. Here there is
 none.
 
And the consequences of such a rule
 
would prevent the State from carrying out an
 execution on Madison, who -- a convicted -­

 understanding of his -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- interesting to
 
me because I don't read anywhere in Kirkland
 where he did any analysis of rationality. What
 he did, as I understood it, is just does he
 remember his crime or something -- he doesn't
 remember his crime, but does he understand
 where he is and what they are going to do to
 him? That's not the same as rational
 understanding.
 
He did no memory test to see how long
 
Mr. Madison retained information generally. He
 did not describe the extent of his dementia.
 He didn't do any of the things one would expect
 if he was going to opine on rationality.

So how -- the only one who did that
 
was Dr. Goff, and that part of his discussion
 
was not addressed by the Court below at all.
 
MR. GOVAN: Just -- just two points in
 
response to that, Your Honor. We disagree,
 Number 1, on page 2 of Dr. Kirkland's report,
 he did set out the Ford and Panetti standard.
 
And as the trial court noted in the
 
hearing, doctor -- that particular doctor had
 done, I think, approximately 4,000 competency
 evaluations, which was for competency to stand
 trial, was -- is similar to the standard for
 competency to be executed, as the Texas brief
 points out, and he did analyze the rational
 understanding.
 
And it would make sense, again, why
 
Dr. Kirkland would not specifically inquire to
 whether an inmate would remember committing the
 crime because that is not determinative under
 Ford and Panetti. But in this case, because
 Madison does have a rational understanding that
 he was convicted of the crime of murder, that
 he will be executed for that murder, we would
 ask this Court to affirm the state court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON,
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
 
MR. STEVENSON: Yes. Thank you.
 
I just want to stress and invite this
 
Court to look at the Eleventh Circuit pleadings
 where the state took the exactly opposite
 position.
 
There has been no point prior to this
 
Court where the state has acknowledged that
 dementia would be a basis on which a court
 could find someone incompetent to be executed.
 Their brief, the post-hearing brief that they
 filed after the hearing begins, "Initially, it
 must be noted that Madison has failed to
 implicate Ford or Panetti in this proceeding.
 Both the court-appointed expert and the
 defense-retained expert agree that Madison does
 not suffer from psychosis or delusions."
 
That was the circle they drew around
 
the evidentiary consideration. Dr. Kirkland,
 after hearing Dr. Goff's testimony, says I
 agree with it, but he conceded, he expressly

stated that he doesn't believe it's relevant
 
because of the very narrow legal standard here.
 
And that very legal -- narrow legal
 
standard was given to him and to the Court by
 the state as only including psychosis,
 delusions, and insanity. At the Eleventh
 Circuit, they made that argument. And that's
 why the Eleventh Circuit made the judgment that
 if you consider dementia, you come to a
 different finding.
 
I just don't think it's credible to
 
argue that the judge in this case considered
 dementia and made a determination that Mr.
 Madison's dementia does not leave him competent
 to be executed.
 
And to that extent, we've never argued
 
that this is a case about a categorical ban on
 executing people with a certain kind of
 condition. What we've argued is that this
 Court has held in Ford and Panetti that it is
 unconstitutional to execute people who are
 incompetent. And we've rooted that argument on
 what this Court has acknowledged.
 
The Court has said: Look, the death
 
penalty gives the State an incredible power.

It's an awesome power. The authority to
 
execute someone who is not an immediate threat
 is an awesome power.
 
And that power has to be utilized
 
fairly, reliably, and humanely. This Court's
 jurisprudence in Ford and Panetti speaks to the
 humane part.
 
And what this Court said is that if
 
someone is disabled and incompetent and fragile
 and bewildered and confused, in the way that we
 have seen, in the context of insanity, in the
 context of other kinds of mental illness, it is
 simply not humane to execute them.
 
And in that regard, the Eighth
 
Amendment here plays a different role than some
 of the other amendments. The Court always
 looks at facts and circumstances through the
 lens of the Constitution, through the window of
 the Constitution, and we have that here.
 
But the eighth amendment isn't just a
 
window. It's a mirror. And what the Court has
 said is that our norms, our values are
 implicated, when we do things to really
 fragile, really vulnerable people. And what
 we've argued is that dementia in this case

renders Mr. Madison frail, bewildered,
 
vulnerable in a way that cannot be reconciled
 with executing him because of his incompetency.
 
The State never acknowledged that
 
argument as a base -- a valid argument. The
 Court never made the finding about that
 argument. And we believe that when you
 consider the facts of his dementia and this
 Court's holdings, that a determination that
 executing someone in this condition cannot be
 reconciled with an Eighth Amendment prohibition
 against cruel and unusual punishment.
 
And for that reason this awesome power
 
that the state has requires obligations,
 requires oversight. And here the state didn't
 meet those obligations and oversight by making
 the informed determination that his dementia
 does not leave him so incapacitated that he is
 incompetent to be executed. They never said
 anything about dementia.
 
And so I don't think this Court can
 
rely on the argument that somehow, in this
 invisible record, with no reference to dementia
 by the state, by the expert, or by the court,
 that that determination has been found. The

only court to make a determination about the
 
relevance of dementia here was the Eleventh
 Circuit.
 
And what they clearly found is that
 
when you look at the level of despair and the
 level of confusion and the level of injury, and
 Mr. Chief Justice, you're right, it's not just
 the physical symptoms. It's not just that he's
 blind and can't walk and can't speak, but those
 symptoms reinforce the credibility, the
 legitimacy, the severity of his acute dementia.
 
And we don't believe this Court can,
 
consistent with the Eighth Amendment's
 prohibition against cruel and unusual
 punishment, allow an execution of someone
 impaired in the way that Mr. Madison is
 impaired or to allow any defendant to be
 declared competent to be executed over these
 kinds of clear, medically verifiable disorders.
 
And for that reason, we would ask this
 
Court to reverse the lower court judgment.
 Thank you.
