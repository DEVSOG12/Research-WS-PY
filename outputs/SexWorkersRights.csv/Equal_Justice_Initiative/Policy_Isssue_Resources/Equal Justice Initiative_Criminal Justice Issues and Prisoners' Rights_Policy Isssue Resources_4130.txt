Even after they’re released from prison, parole conditions require formerly incarcerated people to pay restitution, supervision fees, and other costs. Loss of employment and housing, threatened immigration status, and disqualification from welfare benefits, student loans, and certain licenses often condemn formerly incarcerated people and their families to lifelong poverty.We’re exposing harsh drug laws as racially biased and ineffective, challenging excessive habitual offender laws, and calling for smart reforms to undo our reliance on abusive and hopeless sentencing policies.Drug OffensesDisproportionate arrests, convictions, and sentences for drug offenses have devastated communities of color in America.Related CaseBrooker v.

It’s a health problem that should be managed by medical professionals. We advocate against prison for low-level drug offenders and for a health-care approach that provides treatment to reduce dependency and advances prevention efforts for people at high risk for substance use disorders.“Three Strikes, You’re Out”Most “three strikes” laws mandate a life sentence for a third felony conviction—even for people who have never committed a violent or aggravated crime.Related Resource'You Ought to Get a Second Chance’AL.com reports on people incarcerated in Alabama who were resentenced.Starting with Washington in 1993, more than half the states and the federal government enacted so-called “three strikes” laws within a decade.11 Michael Vitiello, “Three Strikes Laws: A Real or Imagined Deterrent to Crime?,” ABA Journal (Apr. 1, 2002).California’s three strikes law passed in 1994. It required that a person convicted of a felony who has two or more prior convictions for certain offenses must be sentenced to at least 25 years to life in state prison, even if the third offense is nonviolent. People have been sentenced to life in prison for shoplifting a pair of socks or stealing bread.12 EJI, “California Passes Three Strikes Reform” (Nov. 7, 2012).Under Alabama’s habitual felony offender law, hundreds of people have been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for petty, nonviolent crimes like stealing a bicycle.13 EJI, “EJI Wins Relief for Persons Sentenced to Die in Prison for Nonviolent Crimes” (Sept. 13, 2007).The federal three strikes provisions enacted in 1994 required mandatory life imprisonment for a serious violent felony third strike, but only one prior offense had to be a violent crime; the other could be a “serious drug offense.”14 U.S. Department of Justice, “Sentencing Enhancement—’Three Strikes’ Law,” Criminal Resource Manual 1032 (Mar. 13, 1995).Federal prosecutors can also file a notice invoking a provision that makes a third felony drug offense—state or federal, no matter how old the priors—subject to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole.15 C.J.

About half of that was earmarked for states that enacted stringent “truth-­in-sentencing” laws—requiring people to serve at least 85% of their prison sentences.17 Lauren-Brooke Eisen, “The 1994 Crime Bill and Beyond: How Federal Funding Shapes the Criminal Justice System,” Brennan Center for Justice (Sept. 9, 2019).By 1999, 29 states had abandoned “indeterminate sentencing” policies—which gave parole boards broad discretion to release people who had served, on average, 44% of their sentences—to adopt “truth-in-sentencing” regimes.18 Paula M. Ditton, Doris James Wilson, “Truth in Sentencing in State Prisons,” Bureau of Justice Statistics (Jan. 1999).Eight states (Arizona, Delaware, Kansas, Mississippi, Ohio, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin) abolished parole boards in 1994.
