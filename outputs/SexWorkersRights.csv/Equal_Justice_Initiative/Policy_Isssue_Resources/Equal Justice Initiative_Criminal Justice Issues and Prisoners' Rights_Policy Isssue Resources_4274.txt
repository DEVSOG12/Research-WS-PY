Tutwiler, The Birmingham News wrote, “The state must demand better, Corrections must demand better, and the attorney general must demand better, with or without federal prodding.”The Department of Justice is now investigating the allegations.In response to EJI’s report, Alabama Prisons Commissioner Kim Thomas said he wants to do things to make prisons safer.“I’m going to look at a variety of things to make sure our policy is being carried out, and see if there’s a way to improve the process, environment or climate,” Thomas said.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesFindings from EJI's Investigation into Sexual Violence at Tutwiler Prison for Women, 5/22/12documentPress Release, 5/22/12documentRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
