The Justice Department found “a high level of violence that is too common, cruel, of an unusual nature, and pervasive.”Over the past decade, Alabama’s prison system has seen one of the largest and fastest increases in prison mortality in the country. Alabama’s prison mortality rate increased from 296 deaths per 100,000 incarcerated people in 2008 to 588 in 2018. That 99% jump is more than three times the increase seen in other state prisons across the country.Since 2018, Alabama’s prison mortality rate has continued to rise, reaching 1,087 deaths per 100,000 in 2020.Alabama’s skyrocketing prison mortality rate is fueled by deaths from homicide, suicide, and drug overdoses, many of which are not publicly reported and are misclassified as deaths due to “natural causes” in statistical reports produced by the Alabama Department of Corrections.The Justice Department found that ADOC’s reporting “obscures the level of harm from violence in Alabama’s prisons for men” by classifying “prisoners’ deaths as occurring by ‘natural causes’ when the death is caused by prisoner-on-prisoner violence.”Travis Hutchins (left) and Kenneth GilchristTags:AlabamaPrison ConditionsRelated Resources2 Inmates Killed Within a Week in State PrisonsAPRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
