Wood, a clinical psychologist who spent two months working at Tutwiler in 2012.“I’ve worked in prisons for most of 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.”The Justice Department’s investigation began after EJI filed a complaint with the Department calling for a swift and thorough federal investigation into widespread sexual abuse of women prisoners by male guards at Tutwiler.“It is just a culture of deprivation and abuse, not just at Tutwiler but in institutions across Alabama,” said Charlotte Morrison, a senior lawyer at EJI.The federal investigation revealed that prison staff have raped, sodomized, fondled, and exposed themselves to prisoners; coerced prisoners to engage in oral sex; engaged in voyeurism, watching women while they shower and use the toilet; and subject women to a “daily barrage of sexually explicit verbal abuse.”The Attorney General set out reforms that state officials must take to avoid a federal lawsuit.The deadline for implementing those reforms is this Friday, March 7.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesNew York TimesTroubles at Womenâs Prison Test AlabamaAssociated PressFormer Inmates Recount Incidents of Sexual Misconduct at TutwilerWSFA EditorialWhere's the Outrage?Associated PressGov.
