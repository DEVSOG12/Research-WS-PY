In interviews with more than 50 women incarcerated at Tutwiler, EJI had uncovered evidence of frequent and severe officer-on-inmate sexual violence. The Department of Justice has now launched a formal investigation into conditions at Tutwiler.EJI’s investigation revealed that women who reported sexual abuse at Tutwiler were routinely placed in segregation, where they were treated no differently from women held there for punitive reasons: they were deprived of telephone, mail, and visit privileges and had no access to recreation, programs, or work assignments.These punitive responses to allegations of sexual abuse created an atmosphere of intimidation, EJI reported, and discouraged inmate complaints of sexual misconduct.Last Thursday, Fox news reported that Commissioner Thomas now says that policy has changed. Thomas says inmates are no longer placed in segregation when they make a complaint and he made that change to reassure the inmate population.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesFox 6 WBRC NewsFormer Inmates Make Sexual Abuse Allegations Against Tutwiler PrisonMontgomery AdvertiserdocumentPrison's Policies ChangingBBC World ServicePrison rape: Is the US doing enough to protect inmates?Recent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
