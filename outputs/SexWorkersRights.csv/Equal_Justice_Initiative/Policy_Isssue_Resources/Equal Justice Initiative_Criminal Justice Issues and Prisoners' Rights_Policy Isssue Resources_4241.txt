The coverage documented staff abuse of inmates and criminal misconduct that has plagued Alabama facilities, as well as the demonstrated ineffectiveness of current leadership.Reforms that the Department of Corrections must pursue in 2015 were identified: it must “fix the basics” such as violence, sexual abuse, criminal abuse of power, and inadequate health care. And to do this, leaders must be held accountable.Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore – “no liberal,” in his own words – has begun to find fault with Alabama prisons and the state’s criminal justice system, explaining, “I don’t see a lot of mercy in our justice system.” Chief Justice Moore expressed concern over the severity of sentences that are given to criminal defendants in Alabama and believes that the habitual offender law is “applied unfairly.”EJI is hopeful that the increased media coverage of the Alabama prison crisis will help lead to serious and tangible reforms in 2015, including safer and more humane conditions for the state’s inmates and a change in leadership at the Department of Corrections.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesAL.com EditorialPrison Reform Must Start with New Leadership for Alabama's PrisonsAL.comThree Imperatives as Alabama Eyes Prison Reform in 2015AL.comAlabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore: "System Lacks Mercy"AL.comChanging Alabama's Prisons is a Job for EveryoneRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
