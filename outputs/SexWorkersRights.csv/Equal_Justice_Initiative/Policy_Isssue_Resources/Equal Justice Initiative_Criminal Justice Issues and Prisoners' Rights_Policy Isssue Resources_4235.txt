A 2013 study by the RAND Corporation showed that incarcerated people who participated in correctional education, including college-level classes, were much less likely to return to prison and estimated that every dollar invested in education programs saves four dollars in incarceration costs.Despite this compelling evidence, Congress eliminated Pell Grant eligibility for students in federal and state prisons in 1994. These “tough on crime” policies have created a growing underclass of formerly incarcerated people who are barred from productively re-entering society by increasingly numerous and onerous restrictions on things like applying for a driver’s license, adopting a child, voting, and receiving federal aid for education or food in many states.The pilot program announced today will restore educational opportunity for some of the more than 1.5 million people in prison in the United States, which will help them to get jobs, support their families, and become contributing members of their communities when they are released from prison.“Making Pell Grants available to students in prison is an important step in reversing the costly trend of mass incarceration,” said EJI Director Bryan Stevenson. “People returning to their communities after years in prison face tremendous challenges. Implementing a program that’s been proven to help them succeed not only makes sense, it’s the right thing to do.”Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRe-EntryRecent NewsMore newsEJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22EJI Partners Across the Country Dedicate Markers Recognizing Lynchings10.14.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
