But as we detailed in our 2010 report on illegal racial discrimination in jury selection, the problem is a continuing legacy of our history of racial injustice.The problem persists because those who perpetrate or tolerate racial bias—including trial and appellate courts, defense lawyers, lawmakers, and prosecutors—act with impunity. Courts that fail to create jury lists that fairly represent their communities face no repercussions. Prosecutors who unlawfully strike Black people from juries don’t get fined, sanctioned, or held accountable.Several states, including California, Washington, Connecticut, and New Jersey, have recognized the problem and implemented reforms or initiated studies. But other states have hesitated to address the problem. Most states have done nothing.How to citeEqual Justice Initiative, “Race and the Jury: Illegal Racial Discrimination in Jury Selection” (2021).Related ResourcesIllegal Racial Discrimination in Jury Selection: A Continuing LegacyEJI's 2010 ReportFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
