QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
 
  Over the last two decades, criminal punishment 
of people in possession of  marijuana for personal use 
has evolved dramatically in the United States and 
extreme sentences have become increasingly rare. 
Lee Carroll Brooker was convicted of possession of less than three pounds of marijuana under Alabama 
Code section 13A-12-231, which makes it a Class A 
felony for any person to be “knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, in excess of one kilo or 2.2 
pounds of any part of the plant of the genus Canna-
bis.” He was not charged with intent to sell or dis-tribute, and it was undisputed at trial that Mr. 
Brooker grew the marijuana for his personal use. 
Under Alabama’s habitual offender statute, this conviction required that he be given a mandatory 
sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The 
trial judge bemoaned his lack of discretion and re-gretfully imposed that extreme sentence raising 
important constitutional questions: 
1. Is a mandatory life imprisonment without parole 
sentence inherently excessive under the Eighth 
Amendment when the predicate for its imposition is a conviction for possession of marijuana merely 
for personal use? 
2. Does equating possession of marijuana for per-
sonal use with the most heinous and aggravated 
crimes in a State’s criminal code, for purposes of repeat-offender sentencing, violate the propor-
tionality requirement of the Eighth Amendment? ii 
 
QUESTIONS PRESENTED  – Continued 
 
 3. Does a mandatory lif e imprisonment without 
parole sentence, imposed on an individual with prior convictions whose current offense is nothing 
more than the mere possession of marijuana for 
personal use, violate the Eighth Amendment’s evolving standards of decency when such an ex-
treme sentence for similarly situated offenders is 
unauthorized in almost every American jurisdic-tion?

JURISDICTION 
 The initial judgment of the Alabama Court of 
Criminal Appeals was issued on July 2, 2015. See 
App. 1. That court overruled an application for re-
hearing on July 24, 2015. See App. 18. Mr. Brooker 
petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, and that Court denied that petition on 
September 11, 2015, with Chief Justice Moore con-
curring specially to note the “excessive and unjusti-fied” nature of the sentence in this case. See App. 19. 
This Court granted Mr. Brooker’s application for 
extension of time to file this current petition for writ 2 
 of certiorari on December 2, 2015, extending the time 
to file until January 11, 2016. Brooker v. Alabama ,

RELEVANT CONSTITUT IONAL PROVISIONS 
 The Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution provides: 
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor ex-
cessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual 
punishments inflicted.  
 The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution provides in pertinent part: 
No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, 
liberty, or property, without due process of 
law; nor deny to any person within its juris-diction the equal protection of the laws. 
---------------------------------  ---------------------------------  
 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 This case presents an important question con-
cerning the Eighth Amendment and whether the ban 
on cruel and unusual punishment permits a manda-tory sentence of life impri sonment without parole to 
be predicated on a conviction for possession of mari-
juana for mere personal use,  with no showing that 
the possessor intended to sell or distribute the sub-
stance to any other person. Since this Court upheld 3 
 the constitutionality of a mandatory life-without-
parole sentence for drug crimes in Harmelin v. Michi-
gan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), drug policy in the United 
States has evolved dramatically. States and the federal government have increasingly recognized that 
extreme punishments for mere possession of low 
quantities of drugs serve no  legitimate penological 
purpose. This is especially true for extreme, manda-
tory punishment of people in possession of marijuana, 
which has now been legalized in several jurisdictions. 
 Lee Brooker, a 75-year-old disabled combat 
veteran, was convicted in Houston County, Alabama of possessing less than three pounds of marijuana 
plants which he grew for personal use to aid his 
management of serious me dical problems. Decades 
earlier, Mr. Brooker obtained convictions in Florida 
for robbery. Because Alabama alone equates low-
quantity marijuana possession for personal use with 
the most severe and violen t crimes that can be com-
mitted, the Alabama judge at  Mr. Brooker’s trial was 
required to impose a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole.
1  
 
 1 Ala. Code § 13A-12-231 (designating possession of more 
than 2.2 pounds of marijuana as a Class A felony); § 13A-6-2 (designating murder as a Class A felony); § 13A-6-61 (designat-ing rape in the first degree as a Class A felony); § 13A-5-6 (stating that punishment for Class A felony is life imprisonment, or 10 to 99 years). The offense for which Mr. Brooker was convicted is “trafficking in cannabis.” (R. 283.) However, it is not necessary that there be any showing of distribution or transport or intent to distribute or tran sport. Ala. Code § 13A-12-231. 
(Continued on following page) 4 
  Outside Alabama, jurisdictions at every level 
punish marijuana possession for personal use less 
harshly or not at all. Many states have legalized 
marijuana use for medical pu rposes and a handful for 
recreational use. For an offender with prior convic-
tions, only three other states mandate life imprison-
ment without parole for comparable possession of marijuana, raising important questions about wheth-
er such an extreme sentence for personal use of 
marijuana is “cruel and unusual”  in violation of the 
Eighth Amendment.

Lee Brooker’s Background,  
Offense, and Sentence  
 Lee Brooker is a disabled combat veteran and 
retired carpenter. By the time of his conviction, Mr. 
Brooker suffered from an array of physical and men-tal health problems, including pressure on his cervi-
cal spinal cord and several stents placed near his 
heart. (C. 105-06, 170; R. 307-11, 313-15.) Mr. Brooker 
sought relief from pain and  discomfort in the smoking 
 
Knowing actual or constructive possession of a quantity greater 
than 2.2 pounds is all that is ne cessary to be convicted of this 
offense. It was undisputed at trial that Mr. Brooker grew marijuana for personal use. ( See R. 258.) References are to the 
appellate record below in this ca se. “C.” refers to the clerk’s 
record. “R.” refers to  the trial transcript. 
 
2 The other three outlier states are Mississippi (30 grams, 
which is approximately 1.1 ounces ), South Dakota (2 ounces), 
and Louisiana (2.5 pounds). Miss. Code Ann. §§ 99-19-83, 1-3-11, 
41-29-139(c)(2)(C); S.D. Codified Laws  §§ 22-7-8, 22-42-6, 22-6-1(3), 
24-15-4; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 15:529.1(A)(4)(b), 40:966(F)(1). 5 
 of marijuana, a practice that his primary care physi-
cian recognized as a reprieve from the symptoms of 
Mr. Brooker’s manifold health concerns, especially his 
anxiety and depression. (C. 168; R. 314.)  
 Mr. Brooker joined the military at age 17. (C. 
101; R. 299.) Mr. Brooker saw combat during two engagements, first in Lebano n, then in the Domini-
can Republic. In Lebanon, Mr. Brooker’s unit engaged 
enemy forces while helping to hold the international airport in Beirut. (C. 101; R. 299.) In the Dominican 
Republic, Mr. Brooker saw intense combat while 
clearing swaths of Santo Do mingo, engaging snipers 
while under fire and neutralizing an enemy tank unit 
to take a strategically i mportant bridge. (C. 102; R. 
300-05.) Mr. Brooker, a squad leader and Forward Observer, earned numerous commendations, includ-
ing the Combat Infantryman Badge and Expert 
Infantryman Badge with added qualification bars, and attained the rank of  Sergeant. (C. 102-05; R. 
306.) In 1966, after taking custody of two daughters 
from his estranged wife while absent without leave, Mr. Brooker requested discharge due to hardship, 
which was granted. (R. 318-19.) He was then honora-
bly discharged, though not before he took full respon-sibility for leaving his base assignment without 
authorization. (C. 98, 101; R. 299, 316, 318.) 
 Both his military service and physically demand-
ing carpentry work took th eir toll on Mr. Brooker’s 
body. As a result of firing heavy artillery throughout his military career, Mr. Brooker sustained permanent 
hearing damage. (C. 106; R. 309.) Mr. Brooker began 6 
 to have trouble with vertebrae putting pressure on 
his cervical spinal cord, a condition that was causing 
diminished use of his arms and legs until he had 
corrective spinal fusion su rgery. (C. 105; R. 307-08.) 
For decades, Mr. Brooker has suffered severe anxiety 
and depression, for which he was treated by several 
psychiatrists in VA system hospitals and prescribed several medications. (R. 310.)  
 A primary method of treatment that Mr. Brooker 
found effective was smoking marijuana. It eased his 
anxiety and depression as  well as provided some 
relief for the physical symptoms of his other mala-dies. (C. 168; R. 168, 310-11.) In 2011, having moved 
to Alabama seven years earlier, Mr. Brooker began 
growing his own marijuana at the home he shared with his son, Darren, to avoid having to purchase any 
on the street. (C. 338, 343.)  
 On July 20, 2011, two Dothan police officers and 
two Houston County Sheriff ’s deputies discovered 
marijuana plants growing approximately 100 yards from the back of the Brook er home. (R. 122.) This 
included a significant number that had been discard-
ed because they were not going to have any usable yield. (C. 345.) The number of productive, live plants 
and discarded, unusable plants collected was disput-
ed at trial, ( see, e.g. , R. 170-71), but the total amount 
collected weighed around 2.8 pounds. (C. 232-33; R. 
192.) This weight included all but the roots of both 
the live and discarded plants. (R. 195.) The investi-gating officers also found lights and potting materials 
inside Mr. Brooker’s home. (C. 311, 340; R. 134.)  7 
  Mr. Brooker’s son was also arrested and charged 
with marijuana possession, and he was tried first. At 
his son’s trial, Mr. Brooker testified that he was solely 
responsible for growing the marijuana and explained his use for medical purposes.  (C. 340-41, 345; R. 287.) 
This testimony was introduced at Mr. Brooker’s own 
trial, which occurred three years after his arrest due to medical delays, ( see, e.g. , C. 18), at the conclusion 
of which he was found guilty of violating section 13A-
12-231. (C. 110, 235, 329; R. 161, 283.) Under this provision of Alabama’s statute, possession of more 
than 2.2 pounds of marijuana is a Class A felony 
punishable with life imprisonment for a person with no prior convictions and a mandatory life imprison-
ment without parole sentence for someone with prior 
convictions. Although the trial court had put Mr. Brooker on notice that he faced life imprisonment 
without parole as a result of Alabama’s habitual 
offender statute, it allow ed Mr. Brooker to remain 
free until sentencing. (R. 286-89.) 
 At sentencing, the State provided certified rec-
ords of several prior conv ictions, admitted over de-
fense counsel’s objection, and argued that Alabama’s 
habitual offender statute applied. (R. 292.) The prior convictions included three for robbery with a firearm 
and one for attempted robbery that took place in 
Florida over 20 years earlier. The crimes all occurred during the course of four days and no one was physi-
cally injured. (C. 315-25; R. 293.) Such offenses are, 
under Alabama law, Class A felonies. (R. 292.) The State also provided certified records of a conviction 8 
 for violating Georgia’s Con trolled Substances Act in 
1981. (C. 326-27; R. 319). The trial court acknowl-
edged application of section 13A-5-9(c)(4), which 
mandated a life imprisonment without parole sen-tence for his marijuana conv iction because in Ala-
bama possession of 2.8 pounds of marijuana is a Class 
A felony. (R. 293.) Mr. Brooker’s counsel objected to the application of the habitual  offender statute and to 
imposition of a life-imprisonment-without-parole 
sentence arguing that such a sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. (R. 323.) 
 Mr. Brooker’s counsel additionally objected to 
any sentence that did not consider Mr. Brooker’s 
mere personal use of mari juana, history of military 
service, and health problems. (C. 100-08; R. 295-96.) Mr. Brooker testified at sentencing about his military 
service record and medical history, and at no point 
was any of it disputed by the State. ( See R. 297-320.) 
The trial court thanked Mr. Brooker for his military 
service and went on to bemoan its lack of sentencing 
discretion, further noting that sentencing Mr. Brooker to life without parole would require signifi-
cant healthcare expenditures  by the state. (R. 327.) In 
handing down its sentence, th e trial court stated, if 
“the Court could sentence[ ] yo u to a term that is less 
than life without parole,  I would.” (R. 326.)  
 Following the sentencing hearing, Mr. Brooker 
filed a Motion for New Trial, (C. 180-82), arguing, 
among other claims, the trial court erred in sentenc-ing Mr. Brooker to life without parole. The motion 
was subsequently denied by the trial court. (C. 196.) 9 
  On appeal to the Alabama Court of Criminal 
Appeals, Mr. Brooker asserted that his sentence 
violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel 
and unusual punishment and violated the Eighth Amendment’s principle of proportionality.  
 The Court of Criminal Appeals held that because 
Mr. Brooker’s sentence was in accord with the appli-
cable statute, he was not entitled to relief. Brooker v. 
State , No. CR-14-0126, slip op. at 9 (Ala. Crim. App. 
July 2, 2015). The Court further relied upon its prior 
holdings, as outlined in Wooden v. State , 822 So. 2d 
455, 458 (Ala. Crim. App. 2000), that the habitual offender statute did not violate the Eighth Amend-
ment and that it was consti tutional even though it 
did not permit individualized sentencing. Brooker , 
No. CR-14-0126, slip op. at 9 . Mr. Brooker filed an 
Application for Rehearing arguing again that his 
sentence violated the Eighth Amendment, but this application was overruled.  
 Mr. Brooker filed a petition for certiorari with the 
Alabama Supreme Court again asserting that his 
sentence was cruel and unusual and disproportionate 
to the offense for which he was convicted. Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 10, Ex parte Brooker , No. 
1141160 (Ala. July 3, 2015). The Alabama Supreme 
Court denied the petition without opinion. Ex parte 
Brooker , No. 1141160 (Ala. Sept. 11, 2015). 
 However, Chief Justice Roy Moore concurred 
specially to condemn Mr. Brooker’s sentence as “ex-
cessive and unjustified.” Ex parte Brooker , No. 10 
 1141160, slip op. at 2 (Ala. Sept. 11, 2015) (Moore, 
C.J., concurring specially). He wrote, “Under circum-
stances like those of Brooker ’s arrest and conviction, 
a trial court should have the discretion to impose a less severe sentence than life imprisonment without 
the possibility of parole.” Id. After reviewing the facts 
as presented by the Court of Criminal Appeals, Chief Justice Moore concluded that the sentence “reveals 
grave flaws in our statutory sentencing scheme.” Id. 
at 6. 
---------------------------------  ---------------------------------  
 
REASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT 
I. THIS COURT SHOULD DECIDE IF 
EVOLVING STANDARDS OF DECENCY 
NOW PROHIBIT A MANDATORY LIFE-
IMPRISONMENT-WITHOUT-PAROLE SEN-
TENCE FOR SOMEONE CONVICTED OF 
MARIJUANA POSSESSION FOR PER-SONAL USE.  
A. Mandatory Life Imprisonment Without 
Parole Is an Extr eme and Severe Pun-
ishment.  
 The Eighth Amendment question presented in 
this case is triggered by the extraordinarily harsh 
sentence that has been imposed on petitioner. With 
the exception of death by  execution, mandatory life 
imprisonment without parole is the most extreme and 
severe punishment imposed in  the United States. It is 
a terminal sentence which requires death in prison. 11 
 The severity of this punishment is marked both by its 
mandatory nature and its requirement that the 
person sentenced spend his life imprisoned until he is 
dead.  
 This Court has long recognized that a mandatory 
sentence, where there is no opportunity for a trial court to exercise its discretion, creates an increased 
likelihood that the sentence may be unfair, excessive, 
and disproportionate. See Woodson v. North Carolina , 
428 U.S. 280, 296-97 (1976) (“The belief no longer 
prevails that every offense in a like legal category 
calls for an identical punishment without regard to the past life and habits of a particular offender.”) 
(quoting Williams v. New York , 337 U.S. 241, 247 
(1949)); see also  Almendarez-Torrez v. United States , 
523 U.S. 224, 244-45 (1988) (n oting mandatory mini-
mum sentences are more severe than permissive 
maximum sentences because they eliminate judicial discretion entirely and increase likelihood of unfair 
imposition).  
 Mandatory life-without-parole sentences are also 
uniquely severe because they provide for no oppor-tunity of release. This Cou rt has acknowledged that a 
sentence of life without par ole is different from other 
term-of-years punishments. Indeed, “life without parole sentences share some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentenc-es.” Graham v. Florida , 560 U.S. 48, 69 (2010). Unlike 
other sentences, life with out parole is a terminal 
sentence that “deprives the convict of the most basic 
liberties without giving hope of restoration.” Id. at 69-70. 12 
 Thus, a life-without-parole “sentence is far more 
severe than the life sentence [this Court] considered in Rummel v. Estelle ,” Solem v. Helm , 463 U.S. 277, 
298 (1983), or the sentence of 25 years to life it re-viewed in Ewing v. California , 538 U.S. 11 (2003).  
 Mandatory life imprisonment without parole sen-
tences also typically require the most restrictive conditions of confinement with the most dangerous and highest risk prisoners. Prisoners condemned to life imprisonment without parole are typically barred from rehabilitative programs, services and opportuni-ties for care and programming that are afforded other prisoners. See Graham , 560 U.S. at 74 (“[D]efendants 
serving life without parole se ntences are often denied 
access to vocational training and other rehabilitative services that are available to other inmates.”).  
 Consequently, imposition of a mandatory sen-
tence of life imprisonment without parole presents heightened concerns about whether the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment has been violated when such a sentence is imposed without regard to evolving standards of decency. 
 
B. Drug Policy in th e United States Has 
Evolved Dramatically, Especially with Regard to Possession of Marijuana for 
Personal Use.  
 This Court should decide  if the most extreme and 
severe non-capital sentence is constitutionally per-missible as punishment when the predicate is the 13 
 mere possession of marijuana for personal use. Drug 
policy in the United States has changed significantly 
over the last 20 years. From 2009 to 2013, 35 states 
reformed their drug sentencing laws to authorize less severe and harsh punishments for drug crimes.
3 
Views on marijuana, in particular, have evolved 
dramatically since the 1970s. Twenty-one jurisdic-tions have now decriminalized simple marijuana 
possession.
4 A total of 40 states and Washington, D.C. 
recognize marijuana’s medical utility and have, to varying degrees, legalized marijuana for medical use. 
Twenty-four of these 40 jurisdictions have fully 
legalized marijuana for medical use and have enacted

 Washington, D.C.6 A clear trend has emerged that 
strongly supports the argument that imposition of the 
most extreme punishment possible for personal use of 
marijuana is excessive and of fends objective indicia of 
proportionate and constitutionally permissible pun-
ishment.7 
 
C. Objective Indicia Demonstrate That 
There Is a Consensus Against Imposing 
Mandatory Sentences of Life Impris-
onment Without Parole for Marijuana 
Possession for Personal Use or Without Proof of Intent to Se ll or Distribute.  
 Alabama is unique among states in the harsh-
ness with which it treats  low quantity possession of 
marijuana for personal use. Alabama’s classification of marijuana possession, its statutory indifference to 
whether possession is for personal use or for distribu-
tion, and the punishment it  allows make the state an 
outlier. Alabama makes possession of less than three

 pounds of marijuana a Class A felony, equating it in 
seriousness with murder, rape, terrorism and the 
most destructive crimes imaginable. 
 
1. The Extreme Rarity of Jurisdictions 
Allowing Mandatory Life Without 
Parole for Possession. 
 The laws of 46 states, the federal government, 
and the District of Columbia repudiate mandatory 
life-without-parole senten ces for possession of less 
than three pounds of marijuana for personal use in 
any circumstance, including for habitual offenders. 
Alabama is one of only four  states with habitual of-
fender provisions authorizing mandatory life-without-
parole sentences for mere possession of less than 
three pounds of marijuana.8 Only four additional 
states have habitual offender provisions under which 
possession of marijuana ca n result in mandatory 
life-without-parole sentences for any quantity. Fur-ther, within these states, the amounts of marijuana 
required to trigger the sentence rise quickly away 
  
 
 8 The other three outlier states are Mississippi (30 grams, 
which is approximately 1.1 ounces ), South Dakota (2 ounces), 
and Louisiana (2.5 pounds). Miss. Code Ann. §§ 99-19-83, 1-3-11, 
41-29-139(c)(2)(C); S.D. Codified Laws §§ 22-7-8, 22-42-6, 22-6-
1(3), 24-15-4; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 15:529.1(A)(4)(b), 40:966(F)(1).  17 
 from Alabama’s 2.2 pounds, to 3.3 pounds, 10 pounds, 
25 pounds, and 10,000 pounds, respectively.9 
 The extreme rarity of mandatory life without 
parole as a punishment for possession of marijuana 
for personal use under habitual offender provisions 
raises an important question about whether a na-tional consensus now exists that such a punishment 
is disproportionate to the offense. 
 
2. No Distinction Between Personal Use 
and Trafficking or Intent to Sell or 
Distribute.  
 The constitutional problem of a mandatory 
sentence of life imprisonment without parole for 
possession of marijuana in this  case is further drama-
tized by Alabama’s unique statutory structure which 
does not require any evidence  of intent to sell or 
distribute for someone in possession of 2.8 pounds of marijuana. There was no dispute in this case that Mr. 
Brooker’s marijuana possessi on was for personal use 
to help him manage serious medical problems. The trial court explained to the jury that “the State is not 
alleging that [Brooker] sold  anything. They are not

pounds), South Carolina (10 pounds), Oklahoma (25 pounds), 
and North Carolina (10,000 pounds). Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 4214(b), tit. 16, §§ 4751C, 4755; S.C. Code Ann. §§ 17-25-45(B)-
(C), 44-53-370(e); Okla. Stat. Ann.  tit. 63, §§ 2-415(A)(1), (B)(1)-

 alleging that he manufactured anything or that he 
brought anything into the state. What they are 
alleging is that the defendant was in actual or con-
structive possession of cannabis,  in excess of 1 kilo or 
2.2 pounds.” (R. 258.)  
 Unlike the law in most states, Alabama punished 
Mr. Brooker as a “trafficker” even though it was 
undisputed he used the marijuana for personal use. 
In the overwhelming majority of American jurisdic-tions, the allegation that so meone is a drug trafficker 
has to be supported with some evidence of intent  
to sell or distribute for comparable quantities of 
marijuana.
10 In only three other states is undisputed 
 
 10 In 32 states and the District of Columbia – Alaska, 
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Io wa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massa-
chusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Penn-sylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wiscon sin, Wyoming, and Washington,

to address serious medical issues.

ta, New York, Ohio, Texas and Vermont – there is no offense of “possession with intent to distribute.” Instead, there are only offenses of sale and possession, which are completely separate, so the issue of intent to distri bute does not come up for posses-
sion. Minn. Stat. Ann. §§ 152.01 -.05; N.Y. Penal Law §§ 70.00,

Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 481.120(b), 481.121; Vt. Stat. 
Ann. tit. 18, § 4230(a), (b)(3). In  Oregon, there is no offense of 
“possession with intent to distribute” and both delivery of marijuana in any amount and possession of more than 2 pounds of marijuana are only Class A misdemeanors. Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 475.860, .864(6)-(7).

  Even as a stand-alone offense, possession of less 
than three pounds of marijuana for personal use is 
punishable by a sentence of life imprisonment in 
Alabama.12 No other state authorizes such extreme 
punishment for such low  quantities of marijuana.  
 The overwhelming majority of jurisdictions – 46 
states and the District of Columbia – do not allow 
sentences of greater than 10 years imprisonment for 
possession of less than th ree pounds of marijuana for 
personal use as a stand-alone offense.13 The vast 
majority – 36 states and th e District of Columbia – 
allow a maximum of five years imprisonment for possession of less than thr ee pounds of marijuana as 
a stand-alone offense.

 II. THIS COURT SHOULD DETERMINE 
WHETHER EQUATING  POSSESSION OF 
MARIJUANA FOR PE RSONAL USE WITH 
THE MOST VIOLENT AND EXTREME 
CRIMES IN THE CR IMINAL CODE VIO-
LATES THE PROPORTIONALITY RE-QUIREMENT OF THE EIGHTH AND 
FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS.  
 The principle that a sentence may be dispropor-
tionate to an offense is well-established in this Court’s jurisprudence. The Eighth Amendment, which 
serves as a check on the authority of state legisla-
tures to prescribe punishments for crimes, requires that “the State’s power to punish ‘be exercised within 
the limits of civilized standards.’ ” Kennedy v. Louisi-
ana, 554 U.S. 407, 435 (2008) (quoting Trop v. Dulles , 
356 U.S. 86, 99 (1958) (plurality opinion)). A State’s 
power to punish crime is therefore not “unrestrained,” 
but rather must be “exercised under the spirit of constitutional limitations formed to establish justice.” 
Weems v. United States , 217 U.S. 349, 381 (1910). 
This requirement is met where punishments are proportional to the severity of the crime. Roper v. 
Simmons , 543 U.S. 551, 560 (2005); see also  Solem v. 
Helm , 463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983)  (“[W]e hold as a 
matter of principle that a criminal sentence must be 
proportionate to the crime for which the defendant 
 
W. Va. Code Ann. § 60A-4-401; Wis. Stat. Ann. § 961.41; Wyo. 
Stat. Ann. § 35-7-1031; D.C.  Code § 48-904.01(d)(1).  23 
 has been convicted. . . . [N]o penalty is per se  constitu-
tional.”).  
 This Court’s precedents have consistently recog-
nized that States exceed the constitutional limita-
tions on their power to punish crime where they 
impose sentences that are disproportionate to the offense. See, e.g. , Solem , 463 U.S. at 284 (writing that 
the Eighth Amendment’s final clause “prohibits not 
only barbaric punishments, but also sentences that 
are disproportionate to the crime committed”); Roper , 
543 U.S. at 560 (“[T]he Eighth Amendment guaran-
tees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.”); Robinson v. California , 370 
U.S. 660, 676 (1962) (Douglas, J., concurring) (“A 
punishment out of all propo rtion to the offense may 
bring it within the ban against ‘cruel and unusual 
punishment.’ ”).  
 The question of a punishment’s proportionality 
“cannot be considered in the abstract,” but rather 
must be weighed against th e nature of the offense. 
Robinson , 370 U.S. at 667. In Robinson , this Court 
explained that “imprisonment for ninety days is not, 
in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual.” Id. Yet, in the Court’s view, this otherwise 
constitutional term of imprisonment would be uncon-
stitutionally disproportionat e where imposed for “the 
‘crime’ of having a common cold.” Id. (“Even one day 
in prison would be cruel and unusual punishment for 
the ‘crime’ of having a common cold.”); see also  id. at 
676 (Douglas, J., concurring) (“[T]he principle that 
would deny power to exact capital punishment for a 24 
 petty crime would also deny power to punish a person 
by fine or imprisonment for being sick.”). This Court 
has also recognized that the punishment of life im-
prisonment for an overtime parking ticket is likely unconstitutionally disproportionate. See Rummel v. 
Estelle , 445 U.S. 263, 274 n.11 (1980) (writing that 
while legislatures have autho rity to pres cribe terms 
of imprisonment, “[t]his is not to say that a propor-
tionality principle would not come into play” where “a 
legislature made overtime parking a felony punisha-ble by life imprisonment”); see also  Hutto v. Davis , 
454 U.S. 370, 374 n.3 (1982) (same).  
 Numerous cases in which this Court has consid-
ered categorical challenges to the constitutionality of 
punishment reaffirm the Eighth Amendment’s fun-damental concern over disproportionality. In Kenne-
dy, this Court found that “the death penalty can be 
disproportionate to the crime itself where the crime did not result, or was not intended to result, in death 
of the victim.” 554 U.S. at 420, 438 (noting “funda-
mental, moral distinction between a ‘murderer’ and a ‘robber’ ”); see also  Coker v. Georgia , 433 U.S. 584, 598 
(1977) (“We have the abiding conviction that the 
death penalty, which ‘is unique in its severity and irrevocability,’ is an excessi ve penalty for the rapist 
who, as such, does not take human life.” (internal 
citations omitted)). In holding that the death penalty for child rape is unconstitutional under the Eighth 
Amendment, the Kennedy  Court was concerned that 
“[t]he incongruity between the crime of child rape and the harshness of the death penalty poses the risk of 25 
 overpunishment.” 554 U.S. at 441; see also  id. at 420 
(“The Court further has held that the death penalty 
can be disproportionate to the crime itself where the 
crime did not result, or was not intended to  result, in 
death of the victim.”). Furthermore, in Graham v. 
Florida , 560 U.S. 48 (2010), this Court found that life 
imprisonment without the possibility of parole is a disproportionate punishment for the juvenile who 
commits a non-homicide o ffense. 560 U.S. at 69 
(“Although an offense like robb ery or rape is ‘a seri-
ous crime deserving serious punishment,’ those 
crimes differ from homicide crimes in a moral sense.” 
(internal citations omitted)).  
 Not only must punishments be proportioned to 
the offense, but this Court has further made clear that whether a given punishment is proportionate to 
a given offense can change over time. The Court has 
stated that it views the “concept [of proportionality] less through a historical prism than according to the 
‘evolving standards of decency that mark the progress 
of a maturing society.’ ” Miller v. Alabama , 132 S. Ct. 
2455, 2463 (2012) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble , 429 
U.S. 97, 102 (1976)). “This is because the standard of 
extreme cruelty is not merely descriptive, but neces-sarily embodies a moral judgment. The standard 
itself remains the same, but its applicability must 
change as the basic mores of society change.” Graham , 
560 U.S. at 58. The need to look to evolving standards 
of decency is driven by the Eighth Amendment’s 
central concern with protecting human dignity:  26 
 The basic concept underlying the Eighth 
Amendment is nothing less than the dignity 
of man. While the State has the power to 
punish, the Amendment stands to assure that this power be exercised within the lim-
its of civilized standards. . . . [T]he words of 
the Amendment are not precise, and . . . their scope is not static. The Amendment must 
draw its meaning from the evolving stan-
dards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. 
Trop , 356 U.S. at 100-01. 
 “The Eighth Amendment ‘is not fastened to the 
obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.’ ” Hall v. 
Florida , 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1992 (2014) (quoting Weems , 
217 U.S. at 378). “Mercy toward the guilty can be a form of decency, and a maturing society may abandon 
harsh punishments that it comes to view as unneces-
sary or unjust.” Miller , 132 S. Ct. at 2478 (Roberts, 
C.J., dissenting). 
 Evaluating evolving standards of decency has 
meant, in some cases, that the Court “ask[s] as part 
of the analysis whether ‘objective indicia of society’s 
standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice,’ show a ‘nat ional consensus’ against a 
sentence for a particular class of offenders.” Id. at 
2470 (quoting Graham , 560 U.S. at 61). That analysis 
encompasses “measures of consensus other than 
legislation,” Kennedy , 554 U.S. at 433, including 
states’ “[a]ctual sentencing practices.” Graham , 560 27 
 U.S. at 62. In other cases, the Court has described the 
process of looking to the punishments imposed on 
other individuals in the same jurisdiction and for the 
same offense in other jurisdictions. Harmelin v. 
Michigan , 501 U.S. 957, 1015 (1991) (Kennedy, J., 
concurring) (citing “this type  of objective factor which 
forms the basis for the tripartite proportionality analysis set forth in Solem ” as the type of objective 
factor the Court looks to when determining “what 
standards have ‘evolved’ ”);  see also Solem , 463 U.S. 
at 292 (describing that tripartite approach). In other 
instances, looking to evolvin g standards of decency 
has meant evaluating whether there has been “con-sistency in the direction of change” for or against a 
given punishment for a given crime. See, e.g. , Hall, 
134 S. Ct. at 1997-98; Kennedy , 554 U.S. at 431-32; 
Atkins v. Virginia , 536 U.S. 304, 315 (2002). Finally, 
in evaluating evolving standards of decency, this 
Court has noted, “ ‘the Constitution contemplates that in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear 
on the question of the acceptability of the death 
penalty under the Eighth Amendment.’ ” Roper , 543 
U.S. at 563 (quoting Atkins , 536 U.S. at 312). 
 With regard to imposition of the most severe non-
capital punishment in the criminal code for mere 
possession of marijuana for pe rsonal use, it is clear 
that serious constitutional questions exist. Attitudes about mere possession of marijuana have evolved 
significantly over the last 20 years. There is a clear 
consensus that marijuana use is not fairly compara-ble to the most violent and destructive crimes. All of 28 
 the objective indicia support a claim that a mandato-
ry sentence of life imprisonment without parole may 
now violate the Eighth Amendment and this Court 
should review this important constitutional question. 
---------------------------------  ---------------------------------  
 
CONCLUSION 
 The imposition of a m andatory sentence of life 
imprisonment without parole for someone convicted 
of marijuana possession for personal use presents an 
important constitutional question under the Eighth Amendment. This Court should grant review and 
resolve the questions presented in this case.

MEMORANDUM
 
(07/02/2015) 
CR-14-0126 Houston Circuit Court CC-13-485 
Lee Carroll Brooker v. State of Alabama  
JOINER, Judge. 
 Lee Carroll Brooker was convicted of trafficking 
in cannabis, see § 13A-12-231, Ala. Code 1975, and  
 App. 2 
 sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility 
of parole.1 The trial court ordered Brooker to pay 
a $25,000 fine, a $2,000 drug-demand-reduction 
assessment, a $100 forensic-sciences-trust-fund assessment, a $50 crime-vi ctims-compensation as-
sessment, and court costs. 
 The evidence at trial es tablished that, on July 20, 
2011, Brooker was in possession of at least 2.2 pounds 
of marijuana plants. Investigator Ronald Hall of the Dothan Police Department testified that, on July 20, 
2011, he obtained written consent from Darren 
Brooker, Brooker’s son, to search Darren’s home in 
connection with an investigation into stolen property. 
Investigator Hall testified that Brooker was present 
when he arrived at the residence. Investigator Hall testified that he showed Brooker the consent-to-
search form signed by Darren and that Brooker 
allowed him to enter the residence. Investigator Hall testified that he began hi s search in an upstairs 
bedroom and that he observed a “growing light and 
pots in the bedroom on the le ft that appear ed to be a 
grow operation that was set up indoors.” (R. 94.) 
Investigator Hall testified: 
  “At that particular point, I continued to 
look for the property that I was there to look 
for. There was only one bedroom left up-stairs. I went into that bedroom to look for 
 
 1 Brooker was sentenced pursuant to the Habitual Felony 
Offender Act (“the HFOA”), see § 13A-5-9, Ala. Code 1975. App. 3 
 the property. I did not find the property that 
I was looking for; howeve r, in the closet of 
the second bedroom was old dried plants that 
appeared to be marijuana plants.” 
(R. 94-95.) Investigator Hall testified that, because 
the residence was located within the jurisdiction of the Houston County Sheriff ’s Department, he con-
tacted Investigator Jackie Smith of that Sheriff ’s 
Department’s narcotics division. On cross-examination, Investigator Hall confirmed that he did 
not obtain Brooker’s written consent to search the 
residence. During Investigator Hall’s testimony, the State offered, and the trial court admitted, the con-
sent-to-search form signed by Darren Brooker and 17 
photographs of the evidence discovered inside the residence. Brooker did not object to the admission of 
that evidence. 
 Investigator Smith testified that, after Investiga-
tor Hall contacted him, he responded to Darren’s 
residence and observed what he believed to be an indoor marijuana-growing operation. Investigator 
Smith confirmed that, based  on his observations, he 
decided to search for additional plants outside the house. Investigator Smit h testified that Brooker 
confirmed to him that there were marijuana plants 
outside. Investigator Smith testified that “there were 
few plants, infant plants, real young plants, that were 
in pots just outside the back door that was separate 
from the garden where the bigger plants were.” (R. 120.) Investigator Smith te stified that Brooker “di-
rected [him] down a path behind the house” where 37 App. 4 
 larger marijuana plants were located approximately 
100 yards away. (R. 120.) Duri ng Investigator Smith’s 
testimony, the State offered, and the trial court 
admitted, 20 photos of the evidence discovered on 
Darren’s property. Brooker did not object to the 
admission of that evidence. 
 Investigator Joshua Robertson of the Houston 
County Sheriffs Department’s narcotics division 
testified that he accompanied Investigator Smith to Darren’s residence on July 20, 2011. Investigator 
Robertson testified that he  collected and inventoried 
the following items found in the house and on the surrounding property that were connected to the 
marijuana-growing operation: (1) 37 plants located 
outside the residence; (2) two plants located inside the residence; (3) rolling papers; (4) burned marijua-
na cigarettes; (5) loose marijuana leaves, stems, and 
seeds; (6) plant food; (7) fluorescent lights and bulbs; 
(8) two “Harvest Probe, 1000 sunlight supply power 
burners” (R. 151); (9) automat ic timers; and (10) a 
large scale used for weighing marijuana. Investigator Robertson testified that th ose items were typically 
used in indoor marijuana-growing operations. During 
Investigator Robertson’s testimony, the State offered, and the trial court admitted, the marijuana plants, 
lights, light bulbs, timers, sc ale, and sunlight supply 
power burners collected fr om Darren’s property as 
well as the certified deed showing Darren as the 
owner of the property. Brooker did not object to the 
admission of that evidence. The State also offered the 
Sheriff Department’s inventory list of the evidence App. 5 
 collected from Darren’s home, and Brooker objected 
on the ground that it referenced Darren as a co-
defendant in the case. (R. 140.) The trial court over-
ruled Brooker’s objection and admitted the inventory list. 
 Michael Muraski of the Alabama Department of 
Forensic Sciences testified that he determined that 
the plants collected from Darren’s residence were 
marijuana plants weighing, at a minimum, 2.8 pounds. During Muraski’s testimony, the State of-
fered, and the trial court ad mitted, the certificate of 
analysis prepared as a result of the evidence collected from Darren’s residence. Brooker did not object to the 
admission of that evidence. 
 After the State rested, the trial court held a 
hearing outside of the jury’ s presence on the motion 
to suppress that Brooker had filed prior to trial. 
Brooker testified that, on July 20, 2011, he was 
present at the home he shared with Darren when law 
enforcement knocked on the front door. Brooker 
testified: 
  “ . . . I opened the door. And there were 
two officers there. And they told me that they 
come to search the house for bicycles that 
was stolen. And I asked them did they have a search warrant. 
  “And they said, no, they didn’t have a 
search warrant. But they had a consent form 
signed by my son. 
  “Q. Did they show that to you? App. 6 
   “A. I don’t recall them showing it to 
me. 
  “Q. What did you say?   “A. But I told them, I said, ‘Look, I live 
here, too; and I’m not consenting to a search.’ 
  “Q. What happened next? 
  “A. They told me to go in the house and 
put the dog in the bathroom. So when I was 
taking the dog back to the bathroom, they came on in. 
  “Q. At the point when one of the offic-
ers said they need consent, they have a con-
sent form, where were they standing? 
  “A. On the porch. 
  “Q. Was your front door opened?   “A. Yes. 
  “. . . .  
  “Q. What happened when you go to 
take your dog – where did you put your dog? 
  “A. I put – I was going to put him in 
my bedroom, and they told me to put him in 
the bathroom. 
  “Q. Did you do that? 
  “A. Yes, I did.   “Q. And where were law enforcement 
officers standing when you came back? 
  “A. In the house. App. 7 
   “. . . .  
  “ . . . When I came back out of the bath-
room, they are in the house. And there’s a re-cliner there at the – in the living room. And 
they told me to sit down in that recliner. 
  “Q. Did you ever consent to them 
searching the house? 
  “A. No, I never consented. I never 
signed no consent form or nothing. They 
were suppose to have the consent form with them, you know. 
  “Q. You heard the officer that testified, 
I believe, Investigator Hall, that testified 
that, ‘No, we showed him the consent form, 
and then Mr. Brooker consented to us search-ing his house’? 
  “. . . .    “A. No. He wasn’t telling the truth. You 
know, I had them lights in the house. I ain’t going to let them in unless they got a search 
warrant. You know, I have been foolish. You 
know, I told him, I ain’t signing no consent. 
  “I have equity in the house. And I got the 
check through the bank to approve it, that I give my son some money. I made the down 
payment on the house for him, and all that. 
That house is as much mine as his. 
  “Q. And you had been living at that 
house a while, right? 
  “A. Ten years. App. 8 
   “Q. And you told them that [you] had 
been living at that house, right? 
  “A. Yeah. I told them, I said, ‘I [live] 
here, too, and I’m not signing a consent.’ 
  “. . . .    “Q. Did at any point in time, did you 
voluntarily consent to the search of that house? 
  “A. No. I never volunteered consent, 
you know.” 
(R. 206-09.) 
 Brooker’s defense counsel then argued that, 
pursuant to Georgia v. Randolph , 126 S. Ct. 1515 
(2006), a “physically present defendant would be a 
person that . . . has the ri ght to object over, say, a 
roommate’s consent” (R. 215); counsel argued, there-
fore, that because Brooker lived in Darren’s house, 
law enforcement were required to obtain Brooker’s 
consent to search the reside nce, regardless of the fact 
that Darren had given his consent. The State re-
sponded that, because Brooker’s testimony contra-
dicted Investigator Hall’s testimony, the Court had to determine which witness was credible; if, the State 
argued, Investigator Hall had testified truthfully, 
then Brooker had given his consent and the search was not unreasonable. The trial court denied 
Brooker’s motion to suppress. 
 Ultimately, the jury returned a guilty verdict 
against Brooker. At Brooker’s sentencing hearing, the App. 9 
 State offered certified records from the State of 
Florida showing that Brooker was previously convict-
ed for one count of attempted robbery with a firearm 
and three counts of robbery with a firearm. Brooker objected on the ground that the records were not 
“adequate proof of [his] alleged convictions.” (R. 292-
93.) The trial court overruled Brooker’s objection and admitted the records of his convictions. The trial 
court determined that, under Alabama law, Brooker’s 
robbery convictions would be treated as Class A felonies. The trial court stated: 
  “ . . . I want the parties to be on notice 
according to Section 13A-5-9, [Ala. Code 
1975,] commonly referred to as Habitual Of-
fender Act, subsection c. In all cases when it is shown that a crimi nal defendant has been 
previously convicted of any three felonies, 
and after such convictions has committed another felony, he or she must be punished 
as follows: Subparagraph  four, on conviction 
of a Class A felony, whic h is this, trafficking, 
where the defendant has  one or more prior 
convictions from any Class A felony, he or she 
must be punished by imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.” 
(R. 293-94.) After the trial court stated that it had no 
discretion under the HFOA to enter any sentence 
other than life imprisonment without the possibility 
of parole, Brooker stated: 
  “ . . . [T]here has been an erosion of [the 
HFOA] as being mandatory in this State, Your Honor. I think that makes it clearly App. 10 
 that there is opportunity for further erosion, 
Your Honor. And I feel like the Court has the 
authority to sentence him to life imprison-
ment. I think the Court could find in this instance, as I put in my brief, that would 
amount to cruel and unusual punishment. 
And you could use that as a constitutional grounds to sentence to life in prison. And the 
State could appeal that, and it could be sort-
ed out higher up. However, I feel in this par-ticular case, yes, you have the authority. 
  “. . . .    “ . . . [W]e object under the application of 
the Habitual Offender Act and specifically that section of it as  being cruel and unusual 
punishment in this case.” 
(R. 322-23.) The State respon ded that the HFOA “has 
been challenged constitutionally many times over the 
years and has always been up held by the courts.” (R. 
324.) The trial court stated, “[If ] the Court could 
sentence you to a term that is less than life without 
parole, I would. However, the law is very specific as to 
the sentence in this case. There is no discretion by 
the Court.” (R. 326-27.) 
 On appeal, Brooker cont ends that his sentence 
violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution and that he was subjected to an unrea-sonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment 
of the United States Constitution. 
   App. 11 
 I. 
 Brooker contends that his sentence “to life im-
prisonment without the possibility of parole amounts 
to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the 
[Eighth] Amendment” of the United States Constitu-tion. (Brooker’s brief, p. 14.) As best we can discern, 
Brooker claims that the HFOA is unconstitutional 
because the trial court had no authority to consider mitigating circumstances or to deviate from the 
HFOA when it sentenced him. 
 This Court has previously stated that, “when the 
trial court imposes a sentence within the statutory 
range, this court will not review that sentence. Hoosi-
er v. State , 612 So. 2d 1352 (Ala. Cr. App. 1992).” 
Wooden v. State , 822 So. 2d 455, 458 (Ala. Crim. App. 
2000). The HFOA provide s, in relevant part: 
  “(c) In all cases when it is shown that a 
criminal defendant has been previously con-victed of any three felonies and after such 
convictions has committed another felony, he 
or she must be punished as follows: 
  “. . . .  
  “(4) On conviction of a Class A felony, 
where the defendant has  one or more prior 
convictions for any Cla ss A felony, he or she 
must be punished by imprisonment for life 
without the possibility of parole.” App. 12 
  Brooker was found guilty of a Class A felony2 
after he had previously been convicted of three Class 
A felonies, and his sentence of life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole was mandatory under § 13A-5-9(c)(4), Ala. Code 1975. Brooker’s 
sentence was clearly within the statutory range, and 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Brooker to life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole. 
  “Sentences of life imprisonment or life 
imprisonment without the possibility of pa-
role imposed under the Habitual Felony Offenders Act do not violate the Eighth 
Amendment. Brooks v. State , 456 So. 2d 1142 
(Ala. Cr. App. 1984). Moreover, the Habitual Felony Offenders Act is not unconstitutional 
on the basis that it does not provide for con-
sideration of mitigating circumstances. Hol-
ley v. State , 397 SO. [sic] 2d 211 (Ala. Cr. 
App. [1981]), cert. denied , 397 So. 2d 217 
(Ala. 1981).” 
822 So. 2d at 458. Brooker’s sentence, therefore, does 
not violate the Eighth Amendment and is not other-wise unconstitutional. Accordi ngly, he is not entitled 
to relief on this claim. 
   
 
 2 Trafficking in cannabis is a class A felony. See § 13A-12-
231, Ala. Code 1975. App. 13 
 II. 
 Brooker contends that “the State violated [his] 
right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure 
in his home [because] the police conducted a search 
without a search warrant or proper consent to search 
from [him]” in violation of  the Fourth Amendment of 
the United States Constitution. (Brooker’s brief, p. 
17.) Specifically, Brooker claims that the “consent form signed by Darren Brooker [did] not authorize 
any member of the Houston County Sheriff ’s De-
partment to search his property. The consent form [was] strictly limited to ‘off icers of the City of Dothan, 
Alabama.’ ” (Brooker’s brief, p. 20.) Brooker further 
claims that law-enforcement officers were required to obtain his consent in order to search the property. 
 Brooker’s argument is not preserved for appellate 
review. “Review on appeal is limited to review of 
questions properly and timely raised at trial.” New-
some v. State , 570 So. 2d 703, 716 (Ala. Crim. App. 
1989). “Even constitutional claims may be waived on 
appeal if not specifically presented to the trial court.” 
Brown v. State , 705 So. 2d 871, 875 (Ala. Crim. App. 
1997). “In order for this court to review an alleged 
erroneous admission of evid ence, a timely objection 
must be made to the introduction of the evidence, specific grounds for the objection should be stated and 
a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial 
court.” Goodson v. State , 540 So. 2d 789, 791 (Ala. 
Crim. App. 1988), abrogation on other grounds recog-
nized by Craig v. State , 719 So. 2d 274 (Ala. Crim. 
App. 1998) “When a timely objection at the time of App. 14 
 the admission of the evidence  is not made, the issue is 
not preserved for this Court’s review.” Ziglar v. State , 
629 So. 2d 43, 47 (Ala. Crim. App. 1993). 
 Brooker filed a written motion to suppress all 
evidence obtained as a result of the search, and the 
trial court set a hearing on the motion to be held at trial. The hearing was held after the State rested 
and, consequently, after th e State had presented the 
entirety of the evidence that Brooker had moved to suppress in his motion. Brooker did not object to the 
trial court’s failure to hold a suppression hearing 
before the State presented its evidence, and he did not object to a majority of the evidence that the State 
presented in its case-in-chief.
3 Brooker’s claim, there-
fore, is not properly before this Court. 
 Moreover, the trial court was faced with conflict-
ing testimony regarding Brooker’s consent to search the residence. In reviewing a trial court’s ruling on a 
motion to suppress, we apply the ore tenus standard 
of review to the court’s findings of fact based on disputed evidence. “When ev idence is presented ore 
 
 3 Brooker’s only objection with respect to the evidence 
obtained as a result of the search was to the admission of the inventory list prepared by the Houston County Sheriff’s De-partment on the ground that it listed Darren as a codefendant in the case. Brooker does not argue in his brief on appeal that the trial court erroneously overruled that objection and, therefore, 
we do not address that issue. See Rule 45B, Ala. R. App. P. (“In 
those criminal cases in which the death penalty has not been imposed, the Court of Criminal Appeals shall not be obligated to consider questions or issues not presented in briefs on appeal.”). App. 15 
 tenus to the trial court, the court’s findings of fact 
based on that evidence are presumed to be correct.” 
Ex parte Perkins , 646 So. 2d 46, 47 (Ala. 1994). 
“ ‘ “Where evidence is presented to the trial court ore 
tenus  in a nonjury[4] case, a presumption of correct-
ness exists as to the court’ s conclusions on issues of 
fact; its determination will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous, without supporting evidence, 
manifestly unjust, or against the great weight of the 
evidence.” ’ ” Ex parte Jackson , 886 So. 2d 155, 159 
(Ala. 2004) (quoting State v. Hill , 690 So. 2d 1201, 
1203 (Ala. 1996), quoting in turn, Ex parte Agee , 669 
So. 2d 102, 104 (Ala. 1995)). See also Shealy v. Gold-
en, 897 So. 2d 268, 271 (A la. 2004) (quoting Ex parte 
Carter , 772 So. 2d 1117, 1119 (Ala. 2000) (“Under the 
ore tenus  rule, the trial court’s findings of fact are 
presumed correct and will not be disturbed on appeal 
unless these findings are ‘plainly or palpably wrong 
or against the preponderance of the evidence.’ ”)). “The ore tenus rule is gr ounded upon the principle 
that when the trial court hears oral testimony it has 
an opportunity to evaluate the demeanor and credi-bility of witnesses.” Hall v. Mazzone , 486 So. 2d 408, 
410 (Ala. 1986). When a trial court makes no specific 
findings of fact on the record, as in this case, “ ‘this Court will assume that th e trial judge made those 
findings necessary to support the judgment.’ ” New 
 
 4 Although Brooker’s conviction was handed down by a jury, 
the suppression hearing took place outside the presence of the jury, and its outcome was decided by the trial court. (C. 203.) App. 16 
 Props., L.L.C. v. Stewart , 905 So. 2d 797, 799 (Ala. 
2004) (quoting Transamerica Commerical [sic] Fin. 
Corp. v. AmSouth Bank, N.A. , 608 So. 2d 375, 378 
(Ala. 1992)). Thus, under th e ore tenus rule, “ ‘this 
Court makes all the reasonable inferences and credi-
bility choices supportive of the decision of the trial 
court.’ ” Kennedy v. State , 640 So. 2d 22, 26 (Ala. 
Crim. App. 1993) (quoting Bradley v. State , 494 So. 2d 
750, 761 (Ala. Crim. App. 1985)). “[A]ny conflicts in 
the testimony or credibilit y of witnesses during a 
suppression hearing is a matter for resolution by the 
trial court. Absent a gross abuse of discretion, a trial 
court’s resolution of [such ] conflict[s] should not be 
reversed on appeal.” Sheely v. State , 629 So. 2d 23, 29 
(Ala. Crim. App. 1993) (citat ions omitted). “Under the 
ore tenus  standard of review, we  must accept as true 
the facts found by the trial court if there is substan-
tial evidence to support the trial court’s findings.” 
Beasley v. Mellon Fin. Servs. Corp. , 569 So. 2d 389, 
393 (Ala. 1990). 
 Investigator Hall testified that he showed 
Brooker the consent-to-search form signed by Darren 
and that Brooker consented to the search. Investiga-
tor Smith similarly testified that Brooker was coop-erative when he searched the property outside the 
house. Brooker testified, ho wever, that Investigator 
Hall never showed him the consent-to-search form and that he did not consen t to the search. Although 
the trial court did not make sp ecific findings of fact as 
to the conflicting testimony, its denial of Brooker’s motion to suppress implies that it found Investigator App. 17 
 Hall’s and Investigator Smit h’s testimony to be credi-
ble and that Brooker must have consented to the 
search. Because the trial court impliedly found that 
Brooker consented to the search, we cannot say that the search was unreasonable. See Allen v. State , 44 
So. 3d 525 (Ala. Crim. App. 2009) (holding that con-
sensual searches are exceptions to the rule that warrantless searches are pe r se unreasonable). There 
is substantial evidence in  the record to support the 
trial court’s ruling, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court abused its discretion 
here. Therefore, we will no t reverse this case based 
on the trial court’s resolution of the conflicting testi-mony. Accordingly, Brooker is not entitled to relief on 
this issue. 
 Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the trial 
court is affirmed. 
 AFFIRMED.

Ex parte Lee Carroll Brooker 
PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO 
THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS 
(In re: Lee Carroll Brooker 
v. 
State of Alabama) 
(Houston Circuit Court, CC-13-485; 
Court of Criminal Appeals, CR-14-0126) 
(09/11/2015) 
MAIN, Justice. 
 WRIT DENIED. NO OPINION. 
 Bolin, Murdock, and Bryan, JJ., concur.  Moore, C.J., concurs specially. App. 20 
 MOORE, Chief Justice (concurring specially). 
 I concur with this Court’s denial of Lee Carroll 
Brooker’s petition for a wr it of certiorari. Brooker, 
who is 76 years old, was sentenced, as a habitual 
felony offender, to life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole for a nonviolent, drug-related 
crime. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his 
conviction and his sentence in an unpublished memo-
randum. Brooker v. State  (No. CR-14-0126, July 2, 
2015), ___ So. 3d ___  (Ala. Crim. App. 2015) (table). I 
write separately because I believe Brooker’s sentence 
is excessive and unjustified. In imposing the sen-tence, the judge stated: “[I]f the Court could sentence 
you to a term that is less than life without parole, 
I would. However, the law is very specific as to the sentence in this case. There is no discretion by the 
Court.” Under circumstances like those of Brooker’s 
arrest and conviction, a trial court should have the discretion to impose a le ss severe sentence than life 
imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 
 The Court of Criminal Appeals’ unpublished 
memorandum presents the following facts: 
  “The evidence at trial established that, 
on July 20, 2011, Brooker was in possession 
of at least 2.2 pounds of marijuana plants. Investigator Ronald Hall of the Dothan Po-
lice Department testif ied that, on July 20, 
2011, he obtained written consent from Darren Brooker, Brooker’s son, to search 
Darren’s home in connection with an investi-
gation into stolen property. Investigator Hall App. 21 
 testified that Brooker was present when he 
arrived at the residence. Investigator Hall 
testified that he showed Brooker the consent-
to-search form signed by Darren and that Brooker allowed him to enter the residence. 
Investigator Hall testified that he began his 
search in an upstairs bedroom and that he observed a ‘growing light and pots in the 
bedroom on the left that  appeared to be a 
grow operation that was set up indoors.’ . . .  
  “ ‘. . . . ’ 
“ . . . Investigator Hall confirmed that he did 
not obtain Brooker’s written consent to 
search the residence. During Investigator Hall’s testimony, the State offered, and the 
trial court admitted, the consent-to-search 
form signed by Darren Brooker and 17 pho-tographs of the evidence discovered inside 
the residence. Brooker did not object to the 
admission of that evidence. 
  “Investigator [Jackie] Smith [of the Hou-
ston County Sheriff ’s Department] testified that, after Investigator Hall contacted him, 
he responded to Darren’s residence and ob-
served what he believed to be an indoor marijuana-growing operation. Investigator 
Smith confirmed that, based on his observa-
tions, he decided to search for additional plants outside the house. Investigator Smith 
testified that Brooker confirmed to him that 
there were marijuana plants outside. Inves-tigator Smith testified that ‘there were few 
plants, infant plants, real young plants, that App. 22 
 were in pots just outside the back door that 
was separate from the garden where the big-
ger plants were.’ Investigator Smith testified 
that Brooker ‘directed [him] down a path be-hind the house’ where 37 larger marijuana 
plants were located approximately 100 yards 
away. During Investigator Smith’s testimony, the State offered, and the trial court admit-
ted, 20 photos of the evidence discovered on 
Darien’s [sic] property. Brooker did not object to the admission of that evidence. 
  “. . . .  “ . . . During Investigator [Joshua] Robert-
son’s testimony, the State offered, and the trial court admitted, the marijuana plants, 
lights, light bulbs, timers, scale, and sunlight 
supply power burners c ollected from Darren’s 
property as well as the certified deed show-
ing Darren as the owner of the property. 
Brooker did not object to the admission of that evidence.  . . .  
  “Michael Muraski of the Alabama De-
partment of Forensic Sciences testified that 
he determined that the plants collected from 
Darren’s residence were marijuana plants weighing, at a minimum,  2.8 pounds. During 
Muraski’s testimony the State offered, and 
the trial court admitted, the certificate of analysis prepared as a result of the evidence 
collected from Darren’s residence. Brooker 
did not object to the admission of that evi-dence. App. 23 
   “After the State rested, the trial court 
held a hearing outside of the jury’s presence 
on the motion to suppre ss that Brooker had 
filed prior to trial. Brook er testified that, on 
July 20, 2011, he was present at the home he 
shared with Darren when law enforcement 
knocked on the front d oor. Brooker testified: 
  “ ‘ . . . I opened the door. And 
there were two officers there. And they told me that they come to 
search the house for bicycles that 
was stolen. And I asked them did they have a search warrant. 
  “ ‘And they said, no, they didn’t 
have a search warrant. But they 
had a consent form signed by my 
son. 
  “ ‘Q. Did they show that to 
you? 
  “ ‘A. I don’t recall them show-
ing it to me. 
  “ ‘Q. What did you say? 
  “ ‘A. But I told them, I said, 
“Look, I live here, too; and I’m not 
consenting to a search.  . . .” 
  “ ‘. . . . ’ 
  “Brooker’s defense counsel then argued 
that, pursuant to Georgia v. Randolph , 547 
U.S. 103, 126 S.Ct. 1515 (2006), a ‘physically 
present defendant would be a person that . . . 
has the right to object over, say, a roommate’s App. 24 
 consent’; counsel argued, therefore, that be-
cause Brooker lived in Darren’s house, law 
enforcement were required to obtain 
Brooker’s consent to search the residence, regardless of the fact that Darren had given 
his consent. The State responded that, be-
cause Brooker’s testimony contradicted In-vestigator Hall’s testimony, the Court had to 
determine which witness was credible; if, the 
State argued, Investigator Hall had testified truthfully, then Brooker had given his con-
sent and the search was not unreasonable. 
The trial court denied Brooker’s motion to suppress. 
  “Ultimately, the jury returned a guilty 
verdict against Brooker. At Brooker’s sen-
tencing hearing, the State offered certified 
records from the State of Florida showing that Brooker was previously convicted for 
one count of attempted robbery with a fire-
arm and three counts of robbery with a fire-arm. . . . The trial court determined that, 
under Alabama law, Brooker’s robbery con-
victions would be treated as Class A felonies.  . . .” 
The trial court then sentenced Brooker, under the 
Habitual Felony Offender Act, § 13A-5-9, Ala. Code 
1975, to life imprisonment without the possibility of 
parole, noting that it had no discretion to sentence 
Brooker otherwise. 
 In my view, Brooker’s sentence of life imprison-
ment without the possibility of parole for a nonvio-
lent, drug-related crime reveals grave flaws in our App. 25 
 statutory sentencing scheme. I urge the legislature to 
revisit that statutory sentencing scheme to determine 
whether it serves an appropriate purpose.
