Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 340 is the statute that provides the general guidelines for the Board to follow. While ORC 340 lists the parameters that the Board must follow, it also gives the state departments and general citizenry the power to monitor the Board’s work (340.03 (E)). It is the Board’s responsibility to make its financial information and other operations available to the public in order for these groups to hold it accountable for funding (340.03 (E)).
