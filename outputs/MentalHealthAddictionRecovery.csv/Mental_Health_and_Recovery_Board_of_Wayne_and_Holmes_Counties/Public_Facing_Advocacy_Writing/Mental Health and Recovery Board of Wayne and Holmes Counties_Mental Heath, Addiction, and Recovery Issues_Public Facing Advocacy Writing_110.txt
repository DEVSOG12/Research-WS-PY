MHRB member David A. Hershberger and program coordinator Vicky Hartzler are working with the Amish bishops and school officials to come up with a campaign that will resonate better with the youth.The SPARK campaign launched publicly in September. It is a countywide drug prevention program using a positive messaging, or asset-building, approach. The effort has recruited members of the faith-based, medical, health, education and addiction services communities.The partners settled on finding a way to share positive messages with the youth and not really bring up drugs and the dangers associated with them. The goal is to help each person discover what is the spark within, what is the passion.Hershberger said the idea of "spark" does not really connect with the Amish community. It conveys ideas of fireworks and things flashy.Hershberger and Hartzler will continue to work with the leaders of the parochial schools, about 200 bishops and teachers to come up with a more effective campaign for the community."We will try to write something and go to the teachers' meeting," Hershberger told his fellow board members Thursday. The aim will be to teach the teachers about the message. "We're moving forward."Hershberger and Hartzler will also work on ways of presenting the information if a teacher might feel uncomfortable sharing it with students.Executive Director Judy Wortham Wood commended Hershberger for his work and pointed out the SPARK campaign is a grassroots effort.Deputy Director Robert Smedley said previously it is important to reach people when they are young. Youth will be better served by understanding their lives have purpose. Feelings of "purposelessness" can be detrimental.Reporter Bobby Warren can be reached at 330-287-1639 or bwarren@the-daily-record.com.He is @BobbyWarrenTDR on Twitter.MHRB Works to Tailor Drug Prevention for Amish YouthTagsAmishDrug PreventionPreventionWayne CountyLinksContact UsCrisis TextingPrivacy PolicyOutcomes and ReportingAffiliatesCareersSocial Media LinksContact Us1985 Eagle Pass Wooster, Ohio 44691Wayne County | 330.264.2527Holmes County | 330.674.5772Copyright © Mental Health & Recovery Board of Wayne and Holmes Counties. All Rights Reserved.InitiativesOpiate Task ForceProblem GamblingStrong Families, Safe CommunitiesBehavioral Health/Juvenile Justice & Criminal JusticeSuicide PreventionMindfulness SessionsFind HelpFunded PartnersPrevention ResourcesParent ResourcesEmployer ResourcesSchool ResourcesCOVID-19 ResourcesNews & EventsAA & NA Meetings Wayne and Holmes CountyNewslettersBlogUpcoming EventsAbout UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual ReportFAQsCollaborationCommunity Plan & BylawsCONTACT US
