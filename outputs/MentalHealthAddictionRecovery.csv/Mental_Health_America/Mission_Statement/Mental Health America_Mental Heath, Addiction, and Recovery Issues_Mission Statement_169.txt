MHA believes policy should ask people what they need to live the lives they want and support them in getting there. Recovery is founded on the principle that people can take on meaningful roles in the community despite mental health challenges when they receive the support they need. MHA's goal is recovery for all. There is nothing more important than allowing everyone, and those they care about, the chance to live the life they want with meaningful roles in the community.In the history of treatment of people with mental health problems, our system has done a poor job at protecting people. The story of the Mental Health Bell is a reminder that we cannot return to a system where people are shackled, mistreated, and otherwise forgotten. Since 1909, MHA has fought to improve the system for individuals who struggle with mental health problems.Unfortunately, the fight is not over. MHA and our affiliates continue to fight to ensure access to treatment; improve quality of treatment; reduce homelessness, incarceration, and discrimination; and ultimately move our system towards a better mode - one where people are treated with dignity and early intervention and prevention of mental health problems is prioritized.What We Fight ForMental Health America (MHA) – founded in 1909 – is the nation's leading community-based nonprofit dedicated to addressing the needs of those living with mental illness and to promoting overall mental health.  Our work is driven by our commitment to promote mental health as a critical part of overall wellness, including prevention services for all, early identification and intervention for those at risk, integrated care, services, and supports for those who need it, with recovery as the goal.In response to the murder of George Floyd, Daniel Prude, and many other Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) individuals, MHA is undertaking a review of how its policy work could more effectively advance equity. Over a period of more than eight months and with input from a range of mental health and racial equity stakeholders, MHA created an initial rubric that helps the policy team ensure that its work promotes equity, as well as an initial larger framework that provides more detailed guidance. These documents are versions in use by MHA as of March 4, 2021 to help us evaluate through an equity lens the development of and our potential support for public policy initiatives affecting behavioral health. We will make revisions as we gain deeper insights. Future versions will be dated and supersede earlier ones.As part of our cohesive effort, MHA staff, Board Members, and Committee Members have researched, written, reviewed, and approved position statements that cover a large number of policy issues that we care about. The members of our Board and Committees are consumers, family members, advocates, lawyers, scientists, practitioners, and political leaders who bring their vision and expertise to support these efforts. Each position statement provides an overview of where we stand on each issue, a background of the issue, and a call to action that lists specific changes we want to see. These position statements provide a foundation by which we fight for a better system.MHA collaborates with scientists, practitioners, policy experts, advocates, and other community leaders to design policy recommendations that promote:Prevention for all;Early identification and intervention for those at risk;Integrated care and treatment for those who need it; andRecovery as the goal.MHA works to move forward these ideas through activities that include federal and state legislative and regulatory reform, building public understanding of the issues, weighing in on key court cases, and collaboration with other advocates and coalitions to improve our system.Our position statements cover the main topic areas below.System Transformation Rights and Privacy Treatment and Access Children's Mental Health Criminal Justice and Mental Health Procedural Issues Linkage to Broader IssuesClick below to view all of our position statements.View all of our position statementsWhat's Happening in 2022: Policy AgendaOur top priorities this year include:Access to Mental Healthcare and SupportsAccess to mental health care should be easy and affordable.  MHA will work at the national and state level to enforce parity.  We will support Medicaid expansion and other proposals to expand coverage and fight efforts to restrict access to coverage and treatments.   We will fight for continued telehealth flexibilities, especially through audio-only. We will partner to develop policy solutions to promoting integrated mental health care in primary care and primary care within mental health services and support the use of digital tools to provide more effective and accessible care.EquityMHA will work to address issues related to mental health care access, effectiveness, and relevance in Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities that face historic disinvestment. MHA will call out racism and other forms of discrimination as a mental health issue and continue to fight it. We will support increased pathways for BIPOC communities to become part of the mental health workforce, as well as push for additional research funding to study interventions championed by BIPOC providers.  We also will call out the equity implications of integrated behavioral health services in primary care and schools.To support this work, MHA created an initial rubric that helps the policy team ensure that its work promotes equity, as well as an initial larger framework that provides more detailed guidance. These documents are versions in use by MHA as of March 4, 2021 to help us evaluate through an equity lens the development of and our potential support for public policy initiatives affecting behavioral health. We will make revisions as we gain deeper insights. Future versions will be dated and supersede earlier ones.Financing and Training of the Peer WorkforceMHA will work to increase insurance and Medicare coverage of peer services, especially In integrated care settings.  We will ensure the reciprocity of national certification across states to maximize opportunities and job mobility for peer workers. We will seek to secure resources and address barriers for training and certifications to lead to increased employment, reimbursement, and diversity in the peer workforce.Prevention and Early Intervention for Children, Youth and Young AdultsMuch of MHA’s work is guided by the Before Stage Four philosophy (B4Stage4)- that mental health conditions should be prevented and treated long before they reach the critical points in the disease process.  We will seek to share information on how states are implementing k-12 school-based education, youth peer support, and in-school mental health services to prevent and intervene early in mental health conditions.  We will also work to ensure mental health care is available in elementary and higher education and that value-based payment and other reimbursement incentives reflect the B4Stage4 philosophy.  MHA will support upstream efforts to address adverse childhood experiences and trauma and their impact on mental health.Suicide Prevention and Access to Crisis CareAs part of our B4Stage4 philosophy, MHA supports alternatives to emergency rooms and criminal justice involvement in crisis response. With the passage of the new 9-8-8 number for suicide prevention and mental health crises, there is an opportunity to create a continuum of crisis care that ensures mental health responses to mental health crises and prioritizes equity, particularly for BIPOC individuals. We will also advocate for additional funding for crisis and diversion services, including peer support and respite services.  We will work with police departments, gun shops, firearms owners to do in reach, promote screening and ensure safety in the home.Workplace Mental HealthMHA recognizes the psychological impact that workplaces can have on their employees. Millions of employees spend a large part of their day, and lifetime, at work, increasing the effect that workplace environments can have on psychological well-being. This is particularly concerning for law enforcement and first responders and we will work to promote mental health among these workers.  We will develop additional proposals to incentivize workplace wellness activities, improve culture, and increase access to assistance and mental health care.Bills Introduced in the 117th CongressLearn about some of the bills introduced in the 117th Congress that we're working on and where they fall in line with Mental Health America's legislative priorities:Overall Health Care Reform LegislationLower Health Care Costs ActPrevention for AllRISE (Resilience Investment, Support, and Expansion) from Trauma ActEarly Identification and Intervention for Those at RiskMental Health Services for Students ActIntegrated Treatment for Those who Need ItMental Health Parity Compliance Act of 2019Mental Health Professionals Workforce Shortage Loan Repayment ActOverdose Prevention and Patient Safety ActRecovery as the GoalMedicaid Reentry ActRecent Actions and ResourcesStatement on Gun ViolenceYouth Crisis Guidelines Letter to HHSSUPPORT LETTER: Bipartisan Safer Communities Act9-8-8 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Implementation Act Information and ResourcesChild and Adolescent Mental and Behavioral Health PrinciplesSTATEMENT: Peers in Medicare ActSUPPORT LETTER: House Medicare Peer Support LegislationONE PAGER: New Funding is Available for Community-Based Mental Health ServicesONE PAGER: New Funding is Available for Mental Health Mobile Crisis TeamsSTATEMENT: The Need for a National Strategy to Maximize COVID-19 Vaccination for People with Serious Mental IllnessQ&A: Drawing Down COVID-19 Relief Funding for States and OrganizationsFAQ: Understanding 988 and How It Can Help with Behavioral Health CrisesREQUEST LETTER: For Behavioral Health in Third COVID-19 PackageSTATEMENT: Leaders of Nation's Charitable Nonprofits Urge Congress to Go FurtherREQUEST LETTER: COVID-19 Relief and Economic Stimulus PackageCOMMENT LETTER: FCC 988 DesignationCOMMENT LETTER: NIMH Strategic PlanISSUE BRIEF: Digital TherapeuticsThe Regional Policy CouncilMHA's Regional Policy Council (RPC) works with seven of our most knowledgeable affiliate public policy or executive directors across 4 regions in the country.
