Learn how you can take action.Start A Harm Reduction ProgramDonateShopWho We AreIt started in 1993. More than a decade of government neglect and abandonment had left people who use drugs vulnerable to the AIDS epidemic.A handful of individual activists, educators, and people who used drugs began launching grassroots efforts to support members of their communities who were dying from this brutal disease. Brought together by their love and compassion for people who use drugs, these individuals formed a small working group that became the start of the Harm Reduction movement.Original Harm Reduction Working Group - 1992Credit: UnknownThe last 25 years have been a long, hard, wild ride — filled with triumphs and challenges. We’ve lost countless friends and loved ones along the way and touched the lives of so many more. The heartache and hope for a brighter tomorrow drives us on.Two and a half decades later, National Harm Reduction Coalition is a nationwide advocate and ally for people who use drugs. We are a catalyst and incubator, repository and hub, storyteller and disseminator for the collective wisdom of the harm reduction community.Credit: LuceoCredit: PrecisionOur team of conveners, trainers, advocates, and spokespeople is located from coast to coast.
