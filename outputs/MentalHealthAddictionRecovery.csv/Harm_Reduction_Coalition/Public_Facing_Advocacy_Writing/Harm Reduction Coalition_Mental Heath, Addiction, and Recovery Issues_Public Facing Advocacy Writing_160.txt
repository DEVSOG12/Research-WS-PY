Pregnant people and their families can use this information to understand their rights, access services, and find high-quality, evidence-based care.We launched the Naloxone Finder in 2020 to support people who use drugs in accessing naloxone in their community. The Naloxone Finder was a multi-year, multi-organization project that many community members contributed to. Each program on the map has been vetted to ensure that naloxone is free and for people who use drugs.Looking forward to our 2022 conference, we remain committed to developing relationships with harm reduction partners in Puerto Rico by centering local needs and building organizing momentum for what lies ahead.

Connect with the Collective through bi-monthly meetings or watch their videos on Instagram.Faith in Harm Reduction launched its Spirit of Harm Reduction Toolkit in November!

In the Spirit of Harm Reduction Toolkit, you can explore intersections between faith and harm reduction, spiritual and ritual resources for harm reductionists and accomplices, and concrete ways for faith communities to embody radical hospitality with people who use drugs and people who do sex work.Supporting Environments Where Harm Reduction Programs Can ThriveWe piloted the COHRT (Creating Opportunities for Harm Reduction Training) program to support direct services workers from supportive housing, behavioral health, and shelter-in-place programs doing harm reduction work in the pandemic. Our program included lessons on harm reduction foundations, conflict management, and strategies for self-care in a virtual discussion-based environment.We convened the Executive Director Mentorship and Mutual Aid Support Group to bring together harm reduction leaders facing new challenges during COVID.
