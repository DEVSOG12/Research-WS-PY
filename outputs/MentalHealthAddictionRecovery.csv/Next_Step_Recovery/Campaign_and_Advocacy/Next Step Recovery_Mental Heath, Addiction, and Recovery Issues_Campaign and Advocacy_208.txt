We aim to give men the tools to make long-term sustainable changes in their lives to combat addiction. Our program seeks to build trust with those suffering from addiction in order to break down the mental barriers that keep men from starting on the road to recovery.We have helped thousands of men fight their crippling addictions and get a new lease on life. Our experience has taught us valuable lessons that only help us to better serve everyone that walks in through our doors. We are not just a sober living facility; we are much more. We realize that fighting addiction is a lifelong commitment. That is why our efforts are focused on providing extended care recovery programs that will help men their entire life. The goal is to give tools to make better decisions and get a handle on the root causes of their addiction. If you or someone you love is fighting the battle with their demons, please reach out to us and find out how we can help you. Call us today at 828-350-9960 or head over to the contact form on our website.Men with addiction are looked down on by society and subjected to ridicule, humiliation, and isolation, sometimes even by their own family members. Here at Next Step Recovery, we aim to change this perception of addiction by treating all of our clients with the respect and dignity they deserve. This important first step assists someone in fighting their addiction by instilling hope and self-respect within. It is only when they realize their self-worth that they make an effort to identify that their addiction doesn’t define or control them. To achieve this restoration of identity and self-respect, we abide by certain ethical principles that are essential for recovery. These values are honesty, integrity, respect, and personal responsibility. These values make the foundation upon which all of our treatment programs at Next Step Recovery are based upon. You can read more about our code of ethics by going to the webpage: https://NextStepRecovery.com/code-of-ethics/.We recognize and honor basic human rights for anyone who is going through recovery. The first of these is the recognition that addiction is complicated and those suffering from it deserve the same compassion that is reserved for those suffering from other physical ailments. Those suffering from addiction also have the right to be viewed as individuals who are separate from their afflictions and having the potential to change and grow as productive members of society. They also have the right to be free of judgment and the stigma that is the usual response from members of society who don’t understand the nature of addiction. We also recognize the right to the hope of being able to turn around one’s situation through adequate support from friends, family, and the community. Also, everyone has the right to education about the disease of addiction, relapse prevention, and healthy coping strategies.Not everyone’s journey is a straight line from addiction to recovery. There are ups and downs that one has to face as everyone’s situation in life is different and what worked for one person might not work for another. Everyone has the right to be free from the trauma and mental illness that occur with addiction. Finally, everyone has the right to reenter society with respect, dignity, and defining the journey of the rest of their lives. You can read more about the rights on the webpage at https://NextStepRecovery.com/right-to-addiction-recovery/Residents have access to staff onsite at all times which ensures they are fully integrated into Next Step Recovery Community and includes all of the residents who live and work together in the supportive network. Those who are further along in their journey act as mentors to newer residents and every resident has an AA or NA sponsor to support them in their 12 step work.Many of our residents have gone through the program, achieved sobriety, and gone on to write testimonials praising the Extended Care Recovery facility. One resident says about their experience that, “Next Step Recovery was exactly what I needed in the early stages of my recovery! I spent so many years of my life hiding behind a bottle and I couldn’t take it anymore! Susan and her staff helped me to get back on my feet and start the process of moving on and loving life without the use of alcohol or drugs. After my three months here, I chose to stay in Asheville and continue to work on myself with their guidance. I couldn’t imagine my life today if I was still stuck in my old ways, Thank you, Next Step Recovery!”One patient’s parent shares. “My son completed three months of the treatment program, surrounded by kind, caring, and compassionate staff, with all the skill-sets required of true professionals to guide and assist him in living a productive, healthy, sober, and happy life. He flourished and started to smile and enjoy life again during those three months. He now is starting to build a career for himself and is enjoying the normal things in life that had been missing for so many years. As a family, we have been blessed to have been connected with Next Step Recovery. Thank you. “Next Step Recovery’s therapy has been shown to be highly effective when it comes to treating addiction.
