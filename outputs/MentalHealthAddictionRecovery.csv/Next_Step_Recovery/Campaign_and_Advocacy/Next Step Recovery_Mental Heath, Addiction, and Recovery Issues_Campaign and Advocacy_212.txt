This sense of worthiness is often the first casualty of active addiction. Our addiction recovery programfocuses on building structure, community, and life skills to help clients reconnect with their inherent dignity and worth. We also strongly advocate for our clients basic human rights.We believe we all have a right to recover free from stigma and discrimination with access to a variety of pathways to healing including transitional living programs like ours.Every 4 minutes someone in the U.S. dies from an overdose or substance abuse-related cause—the equivalent of a jumbo jet crashing every day with no survivors! Twenty-two million Americans are struggling with active addiction; another 23 million are in recovery. One in 3 families is directly affected.Addiction is a national epidemic. Make no mistake, the right to recover from addiction is a human right.Protecting Our Human RightsWe invite you to join us in recognizing and honoring some of the basic human rights of those in recovery:We have the right to be recognized as individuals grappling with a real and complicated disease. Recovery from this disease occurs through a variety of pathways including clinical treatment, recovery programs, peer support groups, and spiritual practices. NSR of Asheville’s transitional living program incorporates many of these pathways to maximize opportunities for healing.We have the right to be viewed as individuals with unique strengths who are capable of change and growth. We are not hopeless addicts. We are courageous individuals who are learning to face life’s challenges without chemical crutches or other forms of escape. All human beings work through a recovery process at some point in their lives. Whether we’re recovering from substances, illness, loss or emotional challenges, we are all capable of healing.We have the right to be free from stigma and discrimination as we pursue our recovery. This includes our federally protected housing, employment opportunities, and other aspects of community life all of which support recovery. We also have the federally protected right to disclose our health information, or not, as we choose and with whom we choose.We have the right to hope that recovery is not only possible, but probable with adequate support. Hope is the catalyst for recovery. People can and do overcome the internal and external challenges, barriers, and obstacles that confront them. More than 23 million individuals in substance abuse recovery are living proof that we are resilient and capable of change.We have the right to education about the disease of addiction, relapse prevention, and healthy coping strategies. As with any other disease or health challenge, self-direction and active participation in the recovery process is critical for ensuring optimal health. NSR of Asheville’s strong educational focus helps clients make informed choices that support their ongoing recovery.We have the right to pursue a nonlinear recovery journey. Recovery is a process that involves physical and emotional healing, learning new skills, and trial and error. Relapse is not the same as failure. It is a common part of the recovery journey that provides its own opportunities for growth and change. Over time, with consistent effort and support, long-term sobriety is possible. We have a right to recovery support and compassion even if we’ve relapsed.We have a right to support for the trauma that is often associated with addiction. The experience of trauma (such as childhood abuse, sexual or domestic violence, neglect, or a family history of substance abuse) is often a precursor to substance abuse and mental health challenges. Those in recovery have a right to trauma-sensitive support to create the safety and trust necessary for healing to occur.We have a right to support for the mental health challenges that often co-occur with substance abuse. While one does not necessarily cause the other,mental health challenges and addictionoften go hand in hand. Recovery is greatly enhanced when all aspects of an individual’s health are addressed—physical, emotional, behavioral, social, and spiritual. We have a right to holistic care.We have the right to rejoin our communities and participate in meaningful work and interactions. In taking responsibility for our actions and our health, we have a right to participate in meaningful employment, community service, and personal relationships that are based on mutual respect and not defined or limited by a past experience of addiction.We have a right to direct our recovery and define our lives. Self-determination and self-direction are the foundations of recovery. We find empowerment in our recovery by taking personal responsibility for our actions, making informed choices about our care, and by setting personally meaningful life goals and then developing a plan of action to achieve them.What They Say About Us"Before coming to Next Step Recovery, my life was in tatters. I felt defeated. The first day I arrived at Next Step, I was swinging. I was so angry. I was lost, hurt, and confused. I was living in paralyzing fear; yet, this place, these people, accepted me... They have shown me that a new life is possible. The staff here helps me grow into a better man every day... I owe the person I am today to Next Step's guidance."J.C.,Beloved Client"Next Step Recovery is a safe place with people I not only consider a great staff, but also have come to love as family. They treated me with love, compassion, and respect. They helped me see things I couldn't; helped me grow as a person and changed my perspective on many topics. The people at Next Step will forever hold a special place in my heart."B.D.,Beloved Resident“This is the longest I have ever been clean and Next Step is the reason for that. It has provided me with a safe place to begin my recovery”T.A.,Beloved Resident"IOP was the perfect activity to both keep my week busy while also being able to fully focus on my recovery. The top notch staff members and therapists made this 12 week program one I will take with me wherever I go."L.M.,Beloved Resident"I am so grateful for Nextstep and all the staff members. This is definitely the place I needed to come after I got out of treatment. Here I got connected to the recovery community in Asheville and made some good friends here at the houses. Nextstep has not only taught me what I need to do to stay clean but I have learned so many life lessons while I was here. I will stay in contact with Nextstep because this place has given me my life back and for that I am so grateful!"Z.A.,Beloved Resident"Next Step Recovery was exactly what I needed in the early stages of my recovery! I spent so many years of my life hiding behind a bottle, and I couldn’t take it anymore! Susan and her staff helped me to get back on my feet and start the process moving on and loving life without the use of alcohol or drugs. After my 3 months here with next step, I chose to stay in Asheville and continue to work on my self, with their guidance. I couldn’t imagine my life today if I was still stuck in my old ways, Thank you Next Step Recovery!"Z.B.,Beloved Client"You may have to leave family, friends and your old life behind as you start recovery. Next Step provides not only a home for you to start over, it gives you a spiritual cleansing. From the staff to my housemates, Next Step has brought a new meaning to recovery. If you let them work with you, you'll find more than a recovery house, you'll find yourself again."M.R.K.,Beloved ResidentMy son completed 3 months of sober living at Next Steps Recovery, surrounded by kind, caring and compassionate staff, with all the skill sets required of true professionals to guide and assist him in living a productive, healthy , sober and happy life. He flourished and started to smile and enjoy life again during those three months. He now is starting to build a career for himself and is enjoying the normal things in life that had been missing for so many years. As a family we have been blessed to have been connected with Next Step Recovery.
