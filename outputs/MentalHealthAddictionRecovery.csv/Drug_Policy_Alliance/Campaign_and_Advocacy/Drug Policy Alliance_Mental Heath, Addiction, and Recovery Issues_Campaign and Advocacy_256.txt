There are several concrete steps that President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Congress can take right away that will have a significant impact toward ending the drug war.They must prioritize federal reforms such as letting people at risk of COVID-19 out of jails and prisons, legalizing marijuana and repairing the harms of prohibition by making the MORE Act law, and moving toward the decriminalizing of all drugs while increasing access to evidence-based treatment and harm reduction services.Please tell President Biden, Vice President Harris, and your Members of Congress to make drug policy reform a federal priority.Take ActionYour MessageSubjectDear President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Members of Congress,Message BodyI hope the Biden-Harris administration and Congress will work hand-in-hand to pass meaningful drug policy reforms that will shift the focus away from the criminal legal system and towards a compassionate, health-based approach.There are several concrete steps you can take right away that will have a significant impact toward ending the drug war. Our priorities are outlined here (https://drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/dpa-2020-roadmap_0.pdf) and include:--Following Oregon’s lead and moving forward the decriminalization of all drugs while increasing access to health and harm reduction services like naloxone access, overdose prevention centers, and evidence-based drug treatment.--Responding to COVID-19 by letting at-risk people out of jails and prisons and helping end mass incarceration driven by the drug war.--Legalizing marijuana at the federal level that’s centered in racial and social justice by passing the groundbreaking MORE Act in Congress and signing it into law.--Dismantling the Drug Enforcement Administration and moving federal resources away from futile law enforcement strategies that rely on aggressive policing, criminalization, and incarceration as the default tools for dealing with drugs and drug use.--Permanently removing barriers and increasing access to life-saving treatments and harm reduction services for people who use drugs.For too long, millions of Americans have been denied justice and access to the health services they need to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. People want change. We’ve heard their voices - including in this most recent election - that we should be addressing drug use differently. The new administration must act on the critical priorities we outline or risk seeing drug-related deaths rise, as they have in past administrations.
