Read the Drug Policy Alliance Amendment 64 Six-Month Status Report HERE and the Brookings Center for Effective Public Management Report on Amendment 64 HERE.In Washington, since retail stores licensed under Initiative 502 began opening on July 8, customers have bought more than $16 million of legal marijuana. Total sales doubled in August to $6.9 million from $3.2 million in July, and the first three weeks of September generated $5.8 million in sales.  Meanwhile, these sales have generated $4 million in marijuana excise tax revenue for the state, plus state and local retail sales and business and occupation taxes. Over the next five years, tax revenues from regulated marijuana sales are projected to reach $636 million.  And according to data from the state Administrative Office of the Courts, the number of misdemeanor charges against adults over the age of 21 for marijuana has plummeted from 5,531 in 2012, to just 120 in 2013. The ACLU of Washington points out that this reduction in criminal charges represents a freeing up of limited police and prosecutorial resources for more important public safety concerns like violent crime.
