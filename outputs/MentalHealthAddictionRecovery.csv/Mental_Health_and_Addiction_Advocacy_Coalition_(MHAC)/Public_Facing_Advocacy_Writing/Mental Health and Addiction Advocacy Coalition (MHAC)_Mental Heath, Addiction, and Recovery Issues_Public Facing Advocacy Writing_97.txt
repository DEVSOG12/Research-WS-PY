It’s our opportunity to assess what we need and decide where we will invest the resources we have. One of our state’s most pressing priorities is the opioid and addiction public health crisis, which claimed the lives of 4,854 Ohioans in 2017.Medicaid expansion is the most powerful weapon in the fight against the opioid and addiction public health crisis by providing a coordinated, reliable, and consistent source of coverage for many Ohioans hit hard by substance use disorders. Medicaid expansion has opened treatment options allowing Ohio to leverage federal dollars from the 21st Century Cures Act to augment local prevention and treatment initiatives such as increasing naloxone distribution, funding Quick Response Teams, and expanding access to Medication-Assisted Treatment.As legislators in the House and Senate consider where to invest state resources in the next two-year operating budget, they must recognize that Medicaid expansion is foundational in this ongoing battle and its importance should be reflected in this budget.Kelly Smith, State Program & Policy Director,Mental Health & Addiction Advocacy CoalitionColumbusIf you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of ourUser Agreement,Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,and Your California Privacy Rights(User Agreement updated 1/1/21.
