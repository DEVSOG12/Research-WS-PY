These impacts have traumatic physical, emotional, and psychological manifestations. We understand our responsibility to continue educating ourselves and those we interact with on the ways that racism and socioeconomic disparities impact BIPOC, and that our collective advocacy priorities should reflect the importance of this issue.It is important that we work together to ensure all Ohioans have access to behavioral health services. Together, we must move purposefully and with great conviction and urgency to abolish systemic inequities and deep seeded prejudices and biases that have been allowed to fester for far too long with tragic consequences. Join us by becoming a voice for change and creating the world we know should exist. We know we can do it together.Click here to read the MHAC's complete statement on racism.DonateNEW REPORT: Mind the Gap: Creating a Robust Continuum of Behavioral Health Care for Young OhioansThe MHAC in partnership with Children's Defense Fund-Ohio (CDF-Ohio) released Mind the Gap: Creating a Robust Continuum of Behavioral Health Care for Young Ohioans, a report which details what a comprehensive behavioral health Continuum of Care looks like for young Ohioans from prenatal/maternal up to age 26, along with caregivers.
