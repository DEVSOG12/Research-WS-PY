Neither can be present in the case of infant circumcision, whether performed on boys or girls. The current federal law that the AAP is seeking to change explicitly rejects “custom or ritual” as a justification for forced genital alteration of girls.Intact America believes the same human right that currently extends to girls should be extended to boys. No reputable medical authority currently recommends routine neonatal male circumcision, which the American Medical Association calls “non-therapeutic.”Both the AAP and the Centers for Disease Control, however, are currently reconsidering their neutral stance on neonatal male circumcision, relying on African studies of adult men on the role circumcision might play in curbing female to male – but not male to female, or male to male – transmission of HIV. Intact America argues it is profoundly unethical to extrapolate from flawed studies of consenting adult African men to recommend the medically unnecessary removal of healthy, functional tissue from baby boys in this country on the chance those boys will engage in unsafe sexual behavior decades later.“It appears the pediatricians’ academy is motivated to weaken its previous unequivocal opposition to female genital mutilation because it cannot get around the blatant double standard it applies in its acceptance of medically unnecessary infant male circumcision as a legitimate surgical tool,” said Chapin.The language with which the AAP paper describes female genital cutting is strikingly similar to that which could be applied to neonatal male circumcision. The paper says female genital alteration is “medically unnecessary” and violates the principle of “nonmaleficence” – the doctor’s commitment to do no harm to his or her patient. The paper also calls female genital cutting on a minor girl “a practice that violates the rights of infants and children to good health and well-being, part of a universal standard of basic human rights.”“This is gender equity run amok,” said Chapin. “The same human right that applies to a baby girl should apply to a baby boy. Instead of calling for the resumption of a practice that has been rightly described and outlawed as female genital mutilation, the pediatricians should be stopping the analogous practice imposed on baby boys more than a million times every year in this country, at a cost to the health industry of more than a billion dollars.”Submit a Comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Sort By Blog CategoriesSort By Blog CategoriesSelect Category“Voices”  (35)Advocacy  (28)Ask Marilyn  (25)Blog  (220)By Georganne Chapin  (45)Do You Know?  (33)IA in the News  (3)Intactivist of the Month  (65)Press Releases  (29)Privacy PolicyTerms of UseContact UsCareersNewsroom#1278 (no title)FacebookTwitterInstagramRSS© 2008–2019 Intact America®
