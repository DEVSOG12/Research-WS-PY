For...Do You Know: The causes of tight foreskin and what to do about it?By Marilyn Milos, RN Sometimes the retractable foreskin of an adult male will close down; this condition is called "pathological phimosis." Too often, when men who have developed pathological phimosis consult with a urologist or other physician, they are told that the...Every man who has been circumcised has two stories……the one he can’t remember,…and the one he can’t forget.As a newborn, he probably will not recall being restrained, or his penis being clamped and cut (one in five men say they do remember it). What he is unaware of is that his brain may not develop normally because of the severe pain and trauma.As a man, he might be reminded daily that his penis is not whole, not fully functional, and has a scar running around it. And he might know that he may still suffer from complications, like being at an increased risk for erectile dysfunction.Four Reasons We Do This Work%Three quarters of all American males are walking around today with an important part of their penis missing. Many are oblivious to the damage. All have been harmed, and they—and their sexual partners—have never had the chance to enjoy the protective and pleasurable qualities of the foreskin.Mothers are solicited an average of eight times by doctors and nurses to agree to having their newborn sons circumcised. Peddling this unnecessary surgery is profiteering, violates the AMA’s code of ethics, and is illegal in many states.Every day, thousands of newborn boys are forcibly restrained and their penises are surgically and permanently altered. Even if they receive pain relief during the procedure, circumcision is still painful and traumatic. Many boys will experience complications, some severe, and a few will die.%Four out of ten intact (not circumcised) boys will experience having their foreskin forcibly torn from its foundation by misguided adults. This traumatic, painful and unnecessary action can lead to complications, such as bleeding, infection and eventual amputation of the foreskin. Early traumas are known to cause developmental and lifelong psychological problems.MADE to STICK™Foreskin Protection CampaignNow, as more boys are remaining intact, more are at risk for Forced Foreskin Retraction (FFR). It is time for America to take a refresher course on penile care.Learn MoreFollow Intact AmericaKeep abreast of intactivist breaking news, current events, and ongoing programs.Sign up for our NewsletterStay informed with our monthly newsletter.Sign UpBy Georganne ChapinMy posts and essaysNew to the Issue?Visit our entry-level companion website where you can learn the history of circumcision in America and arguments for and against, plus a parent’s guide for talking about it with doctors.Privacy PolicyTerms of UseContact UsCareersNewsroom#1278 (no title)FacebookTwitterInstagramRSS© 2008–2019 Intact America®
