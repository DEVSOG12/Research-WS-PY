PittsburghThis free resource guide was lovingly assembled for 
sex workers in Western PA by the diligent members of 
SWOP Pittsburgh, and through submissions by local sex 
workers from across the industry.  
If you are a sex worker and have additional resources 
to recommend, contact us so we can include them in 
future editions! Or, if you’ve had a negative experience

This is the 2nd edition of SWOP Pittsburgh’s Sex Workers’ Resource Guide. 
There are new organizations and some refreshed categories.  Included is a 
COVID-19 section with groups whose services have expanded to support 
others during the pandemic. 
The global chaos we felt this past year marked a significant shift in our chapter’s 
efforts. Like many orgs, we took a breather at the start of 2020. But in May 
and June, when power structures at the root of violent inequities shattered like 
a window, our efforts became more hands-on. We prioritized mutual aid and 
raised nearly $1000 during our annual D17 event.  We got a phone line and a 
website to make it easier for the community to reach us.  We put together sex 
worker health kits. Most exciting of all, we gained some new volunteers! 
In the coming year, our focus will remain on mutual & direct aid to the most 
vulnerable in our community. But our core priority remains to shift the dial to 
ensure that every person in this industry has the right to live free of fear. 
No freedom without abolition.  
SWOP Pittsburgh4Know Your 
Rights
Exerpted from a document by SexWorkersProject.org, 2012
If you are detained, an officer 
can question you, ask for ID, 
or pat you down outside of 
your clothes to check for 
weapons.  They can’t go into 
your pockets or bags without 
asking permission, or search 
you to try to identify your sex. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT:
to be free of illegal searches & arrests
to remain silent
to not answer questions from the police
to have a lawyer
If a cop approaches you 
on the street, you don’t 
have to answer questions. 
Say: “Am I free to go?”
If they say yes, then go!
If they say no, then 
ask: “Am I being 
detained?”
If they say no, then calmly 
leave. If a cop tries to search 
you, say: 
“I do not consent to 
this search.”
This does not give them 
an excuse to arrest you.  
They might arrest you 
anyway.  If they do arrest 
you they can search you 
without asking permission. If they say yes, ask why. 
Don’t argue, but remem -
ber their badge number, 
what they look like, and 
anything they say or do.There are ways to stand up for 
those rights! Sadly, police may 
not always respect your rights.  
Always do what feels safest 
if you are afraid of violence. No matter your age, gender, immigration status, or whether you are com - No matter your age, gender, immigration status, or whether you are com -
mitting a crime, US law guarantees certain rights that cannot be violated.mitting a crime, US law guarantees certain rights that cannot be violated.5Y ou can also be arrested by an undercover 
cop. It is hard to tell when someone is an 
undercover cop, because they are not in uni -
form, and they can drink, do drugs, touch, be 
touched, lie, and pretend not to be a police 
officer.  If an undercover cop does something 
you think might be against their rules, remem -
ber and tell your lawyer.
Do not say or sign anything without your law -
yer there! Police are trained to lie in order to 
get info, and they can put snitches in the cell 
with you. Anything you say to anyone except 
your lawyer, doctor or therapist can be used 
against you, even if you are innocent. 
If you need medical help, ASK FOR IT, 
even if they say it will take longer to get out.
Police sometimes take condoms away from 
sex workers. Police are not allowed to arrest 
you only because you have condoms. It is not 
a crime to carry condoms! 
Don’t let the police scare you  - 
carry condoms if you need to stay safe!
Make an arrest plan. If you think you could be 
arrested, make a plan just in case.  Think of everything that 
would need to be taken care of if you were arrested and in 
jail for a few days:
• Children need to be cared for
• Pets need to be fed 
• Y our job or school needs to be called and give an excuse
• Y our lawyer needs to be called 
• Y ou need someone to show up to court to pay bail and 
help you get home when you are released.
• Think of a friend for each of these tasks. Think of one 
responsible friend who can call the others to tell them 
you need help. Give this friend a copy of your ID with 
your legal name and birthdate.Never resist or fight 
back. 
If you are being 
arrested, say:
 “I am not resisting, 
officer.”
If you are arrested, they 
may not say “Y ou are 
under arrest,” or read 
you your rights. If this 
happens, say:
“I am going to 
remain silent, and I 
want to speak to a 
lawyer.”Blogs and Pods

Give them keys to your apartment if they need them.
• If you have a few arrests on your record, try to save 
some money in case bail is set – give a friend access to 
this money.
• Tell your most responsible friend every time you go to 
work. Give them as much info as possible, in case some -
thing goes wrong. Memorize their phone number.
• If you are arrested while with someone you know, ask 
them to call your most responsible friend.
• Usually you can make a phone call after arrest.
