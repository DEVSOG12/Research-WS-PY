To create change we took action to support the repeal of the Walking While Trans Ban and aim to increase the visibility of Black trans and gender nonconforming communities. We also partner with organizations that are Black and sex work led such as the Black Sex Workers Collective (BSWC) and the BIPOC Adult Industry Collective to amplify Black voices. One of our core values is to work towards living in an anti-oppressive society, advocating for Black lives by changing legislation, increasing mutual-aid and supporting efforts that are anti-racist.SWP STORE“When SWP helped me gain my status as an asylee, my life changed.
