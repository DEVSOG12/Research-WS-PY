Thus, there is a need to analyse the formalised and informalised practices that facilitate teaching and learning about trafficking. At its worst, anti-trafficking education steeped in misinformation and myths fails to contextualise and complicate trafficking, which can lead to dehumanisation and violence. At its best, anti-trafficking education can encourage and inform efforts to create structural change, social justice, and individual empowerment. At this online event, educators from universities, non-government organisations, and worker associations discuss one central question: What would it take for anti-trafficking education to be in the service of human rights, economic justice, labour rights, and public health?Featuring Mariah Grant, Director of Research and Advocacy for the Sex Workers Project of the Urban Justice CenterSex work decriminalization dialogue prompted by Hochul (10/21/2021)October 21, 2021 – In September, Gov.
