325Fighting on the Ground
When the unconstitutional Muslim ban went into 
effect in January, the staff at the International Refugee 
Assistance Project  (IRAP) were the first lawyers on the 
scene at JFK. Their clients were trapped in a terrifying 
legal limbo, but we stayed by their side every step of the 
way – and will continue to do so no matter how many 
travel bans the administration creates.1
The Corrections Accountability Project  (CAP) joined 
UJC in May of 2017. Directed by Bianca Tylek, CAP is 
an innovative initiative dedicated to eliminating the 
influence of commercial interests on the criminal legal 
system and ending the exploitation of all those it touches. 
CAP’s work strives to create a society in which no entity 
or individual depends on human caging or control for its 
wealth, operation, or livelihood.Building a New Project3For the past year, our Y oung Professional Board  has 
been organizing  Speaker Series  panels on urgent legal 
issues including the refugee crisis, alternatives to solitary 
confinement, and the transgender military ban. Speakers 
have included politicians like NYC Council Speaker Melissa 
Mark-Viverito and NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer.Starting the Conversation2“Kamila,” a transgender woman, fled her Central 
American town to escape sexual abuse and domestic 
violence. The Peter Cicchino Youth Project  (PCYP) 
filed an asylum application and negotiated with the 
government’s immigration attorney to narrow the scope 
of her testimony to diminish retraumatization. She was 
granted asylum on the spot and is now working with 
her attorney to apply for benefits, for which she now 
qualifies as an asylee.Protecting Asylum Seekers4
When Ms. C fled an abusive relationship, she found 
herself needing Public Assistance, Food Stamps, and 
Medicaid to survive. However, after suffering the 
traumatic theft of all her belongings while homeless, 
Ms. C was unable to provide important documentation 
to the Social Services Agency and had her application 
denied six consecutive times, in direct violation of City 
policy to protect domestic violence survivors. Ms. C 
turned to the Safety Net Project  (SNP) for help, and 
her Advocate represented her in a hearing which led to 
successful restoration of one year’s worth of benefits 
for Ms. C.Cutting Through Red Tape 5
