These will be compiled in the Voices from Solitary section of the site, and sometimes featured in blog posts. Readers are encouraged to send in their suggestions.A reader from Nevada Prison Watch recently told us about the writings of Coyote Sheff, which are now being published by his friends on the outside on a blog, Coyote Calling. Coyote has been in Nevada’s Ely State Prison for about a decade, much of it in Discliplinary Segregation. In fact, of the eight units at Ely, seven are in some form of permanent lockdown, where prisoners are held in their cells 23 hours a day, either alone or with a cellmate.Ely State Prison, located in a remote town in Eastern Nevada, is currently being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project for “grossly inadequate medical care” to its 1,000 prisoners. The ACLU filed suit after state officials failed to act on the findings of an expert, Dr. William Noel, who was sent in to investigate medical conditions at Ely. According to the ACLU:In his report, Noel wrote that medical care at ESP shows “the most shocking and callous disregard for human life and human suffering that I have ever encountered in the medical profession in my 35 years of practice.” According to the report…there is a horrific buy ativan in uk pattern of neglect, misguided health care policies, and little accountability for frequently under-qualified staff. Noel also noted numerous instances where important medical records were missing from prisoners’ medical files. Finally, Noel and the ACLU have raised serious concerns about prisoners who died and were cremated before autopsies were completed and their families notified.This piece by Coyote Sheff is called “Solitary Enslavement.”We sit in these cells like dead bodies sit in cemeteries. Death fills our lungs, fills our minds, fills our hearts and fills our souls as it lurks and lingers and seeps through the concrete. Our minds go numb and our spirits fade into inactivity. We sit here waiting to waste away, erode, dissolve, and disappear into the cracks of the cement.Solitary confinement. What an evil concept, what a wicked notion, what a clever way to destroy a man without even laying a finger on him. Solitary confinement — the murderer of minds, hearts, and souls. The person who designed such an evil conception must’ve had murder on his mind and hate in his heart.We die alone in these cold cells, as our hands stretch out to clutch concrete, but fail miserably to hold anything in their grasp other than the death-stenched air. We die alone — a lonely, miserable, suffering death. We die alone….ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesVoices from SolitaryTagsCoyote Sheff,Ely State Prison,Lawsuits/Litigation,Nevada,Nevada Prison Watch,prison blogs,Prison Health Care,prison writing,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Supermax PrisonsJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

NO SIR! i yelled 4 hours later they removed me from the shower cold shrivled coughing because not only did they turn the cold watter on but they opened the door to the unit and let 10 degre air blow through while i was locked in the shower unable to avoid the watter from hitting me.when the c/o was kind enough to come get me he was holding a picture of my girlfriend he had taken from my cell and he and the other c/os were telling me as they escorted me back to my cell how they would rape my girl analy and gang rape her while one c/o is telling me what he would do with my girl hes licking her picture as we reached my cell the c/o tore my picture in half giving me the top half saying he was going to keep the bottom half so he could later masterbate while looking at my girlfriends photo.i could write for weeks and not tell the same story twice.after 6 months solitary they send a pyscolagist to your cell to give you a psyc evaluation an every 6 months there after an then upon release you get another one .i thought i was alot better off mentaly than i thought id b after 5 years of solitary an i was, but it wasnt untill i was released that i started suffering from numerous different mental issues. today its been 9 years 8 years? since i was locked up and im still suffering from a number of issues an some are new problems just now coming to surface. each day is a struggle to hold it together even after all these years it feels as if im still suffering from the torture from the evil dungeon. i watched so many crumble and violently remove thierselves from ESP the only way they had the power too,by hanging iv even seen one man light every thing flamable in his cell,boxes an boxes of legal mail an court transcripts bed sheets,he lit everything and sit in the middle of the inferno screaming in an attempt to take his life and send a message, how bad do things have to be to want to burn yourself to death? i hope those few stories will help get us one step closer to ensuring that no animal should have to endure that kind of hellReplyreneeJanuary 29, 2010 at 1:20 amI am adding this blog link to mine, People do not know what goes on in prison. Keep the word strong and loud hopefully it will make a difference.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
