We’ve written about it ourselves, here on Solitary Watch, and have also published many pieces of writing by men currently or formerly held in ADX.In light of the heightened interest in the prison, we provide below links to the voices of people who know what it is like to live inside the walls of ADX.“Freedom Shares My Cell”Head CasesAnalyzing IsolationLife in H Unit, ADX“A Prison Where the Building Becomes the Shackles”“Finally Out and Among the Living”“Just Half Crazy and Trying to Hold Onto the Other Half”“A Bloody Nightmare”“Loneliness Is a Destroyer of Humanity”“No Longer a Part of This World”10,220 Days in Extreme Solitary ConfinementA cell at ADX.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsADX,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Constitution,Due Process,Eighth Amendment,Federal Prisons,Human Rights,Lawsuits/Litigation,Life Without Parole,Media,Mental Illness,New York Times,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,Supermax Prisons,Terrorism Cases,Torture,Voices from SolitaryJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Since there is no known “cure” for their “illness”, if anyone can think or any other way to keep others safe fromtheir depredations please let me know.ReplyNil_DarpsApril 3, 2015 at 10:45 amThe NY Times wrote:“Tommy Silverstein, is now at the ADX. He has been in solitary confinement for the past 22 years.”This is an under statement as evidenced by Solitary Watch’s own article titled“America’s Most Isolated Federal Prisoner Describes 10,220 Days in Extreme Solitary Confinement”on May 5, 2011 in which you wrote:“Thomas Silverstein, who has been described as America’s “most isolated man,” has been held in an extreme form of solitary confinement under a “no human contact” order for 28 years.”That makes it just a few weeks shy of 32 years of isolation by my count, most of which, 28 years, you described as an extreme form of isolation.However neither article has counted Silverstein’s time served in Marion’s Control Unit which has also been described as extreme isolation unit on Solitary Watch in an article tilted:“Supermax Psych: “Behavior Modification” at Marion Federal Prison”on January 22, 2011.Indeed one could go even further by counting Silverstein’s time served in various other isolation units such as San Quentin’s Control Unit when he was still a 19 year old teenager. Or going even further Silverstein has spent time in juvenile institutions isolation units such as the CYA facility at Chino.My point is that Silverstein is a case study on the “ineffectiveness” of these units in preventing future violence of, or rehabilitation of, those placed in them.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
