He was convicted of first degree murder in 1997, though he continues to maintain his innocence. On Death Row, Harris spends 23 to 24 hours a day in solitary confinement. According to a friend with whom he corresponds, “he feels like at times he is experiencing the ‘onset’ of symptoms of solitary confinement and has observed it in others.  The only way he and others can cope is to try to keep his mind busy with his own legal work and to find solace in art and poetry.” The following poem, written in July 2016, is entitled “Heartbreak in Solitary, aka Sad Flutes.” Harris can receive mail at Francis Bauer Harris DL0556 PA, SCI Greene Death Row, 175 Progress Drive, Waynesburg, PA 15370. –Jean CasellaThere is this hole I guessit is where my heart used to beit is so annoyingI mean I lay on my bed to watch t.v.and if I set the remote down it falls in thereor my glasses they always fall In there if I set them downall kinds of food crumbs end up in there if i eat toobut the thing that really gets on my nerves is late at nightwhen it is very quiet and all the noise is gonethere is a breeze that blows thru the celland it goes in there and makes this soundits hard to describeits a low wailing like someone cryingthe sound of hope dying a slow painful deathits like the sound a dream makes when it is dyingslowly and in much painit sounds like a sad flute as it is blown throughbut I think I know how to shut it upI have all this sadness and painjust pouring out of me right nowI can ball it up and stuff it in thereand you know if you let sadness and pain stew for a timeit will turn to anger and resentmentand that can really fill up that holeyeah I’ll put it all in thereno more sad flute…ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesVoices from SolitaryTagsDeath Row,Pennsylvania,poetry,prison writing,SCI-Greene,Voices from SolitaryVoices from SolitaryThe Voices from Solitary series publishes dispatches from people surviving the lived experience of solitary confinement.Help Expose the Hidden World of Solitary ConfinementAccurate information and authentic storytelling can serve as powerful antidotes to ignorance and injustice.
