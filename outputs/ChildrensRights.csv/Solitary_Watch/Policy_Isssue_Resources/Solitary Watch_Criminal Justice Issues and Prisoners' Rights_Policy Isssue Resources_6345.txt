Every day in the US, tens of thousands of prisoners languish in “the hole”.A few of them are prison murderers or rapists who present a threat to others. Far more have committed minor disciplinary infractions within prison or otherwise run afoul of corrections staff. Many of them suffer from mental illness, and are isolated for want of needed treatment; others are children, segregated for their own “protection”; a growing number are elderly and have spent half their lives or more in utter solitude…Click here to read the full article on Al Jazeera English.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsAl Jazeera,Bradley Manning,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,cruel and unusual punishment,Due Process,Federal Prisons,Human Rights,Juveniles,Legislation,Mental Illness,Older Prisoners,Physical Effects,Political Prisoners,Psychological Effects,Race,Retaliation,Sexual Assault,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,Supermax Prisons,TortureJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

In many countries also in Europe most ‘borderline’ woman end up in mental hospitals and most borderline men in prison. Both can end up in isolation. This is because of failing investmentin care and warm emotional attachment values in schools; communities andrelationships.Therefore more and more woman start being victims of the anti social egoistic contemporary values such asthe capacity to compete and possess;instead of the capacity to give and to love. To be ‘hard’ is better than to be ‘soft’.Because of the (also for themselves) incalculable social behavior the incarcerated ‘borderline’ patient isinternally triggered not obey prison rules nor to adapt to any social order, even not that of a criminal gang. Thus they will be labeled ‘crazy’; rejected by staff and inmates alike.Subsequently the primitive feeling system of the borderline patient remembers the ‘prenatal condition’(*see below) and feels ‘attracted’ by the socially adverse and perverse feeling characteristics of what in the prison system is called ‘the hole’.This condition resembles all available prenatal fears with behavioral consequences. Therefore in any social group the inmatebehaves more and more ‘insecure’ ;’foolish’ ; starts more and more acting ‘stupid’; ‘anti social’ whereby the old fear of feeling rejected and unwanted is now also socially ‘realized’ and ‘proven’. As a consequence the inmate becomes more and more a ‘security risk’. In order not to kill or be killed the re-traumatized inmate ends up in a ‘familiar’ socially isolated survival mode.If isolation is prolonged this condition becomes personality transforming and incurable if time and personal attention is not invested.Incarceration in general and isolation torture in specifically re-traumatize the inmate; aggravates and triggers the genetically ‘borderline’ psychiatric condition.These inmates become the true victims of our society.They cannot help to be mentally ill and are being deprived form any dignity that is left. The genetically more lucky;and survival oriented ‘neurotic’ inmates have a better chancebe re-socialized.The politician and broader society should realize that incarceration let alone isolation torture is painful and (re)-traumatizing for everybody and re-socialization costs for society are 2-4 times the financial efforts of incarceration are necessary.Only neurotics havebetter ‘coping strategies’ then inmates with a psychiatric condition. In fact, in this time and age I suspect that the latter is in 90% of the cases without much perspective of re-socialization. For the rest of their lives will be unproductive and will cost money for society*Most of the emotional and primary behavioralattachment patterns started in the prenatal phase of development.Similar as the quality of our ‘mother tongue’ is learned during the critical speech development phase between 2-4 years. The basic emotions for contact develop in the womb 0-4 years. These are our primordial feelings of love; of belonging; attachment; being wanted; fears of feeling rejected; strength of vitality; aggression or the level of depression etc. After birth these patterns are usually enforced or weakened according to social situation and genetic makeup.The existential fear of being unwanted or rejected makes the untreated ‘borderline’ patient indeed incapable for re-socialization during and after incarceration. This is due to the fact that being incarcerated he or she is in a similar ‘cold womb’ which means stimulus deprivation of love hormones (oxytocine and prolactin) and too much stress hormones. These stimuli come via the placenta from the mother. ( the gruesome Nazi experiments thought us one good thing: A human baby cannot survive when it is only nurtured an cleaned without love. They did experimentswhereby the skin of the baby is not touched by the hands or skin of the nurse and words are not emotionally high pitched personal and warm).Since an ideal womb does not exist specially the solitary cell block every inmate suffers and survives his own primordial emotional growth and painful traumatization process.And again this is a lonely processstimulated by the circumstances of ‘the hole’. The body regresses and the inmate is uncontrollable flooded by pain and instinctively freezes all needs and emotions for love and positive contact impulses from emerging.This is understandable because these needs are too painful. After a while this becomes a ‘personality transforming traumatic experience’. The reason isobvious: the continuous repetitive deprivation of meaningful contact; the violent or rare cold touch of staff; little and bad food; perverted attachment and sex. Sometimes a deprived body is so desperate that to experience of pain while being beaten is better than no touch at all. The rest is only the physical and mental struggle to live, but in fact not good enough to live and not bad enough to die. Some light in the dark?There are countries with 10% recidivism and some with 80%. Why this difference?Health care and re-socialization programs give a solution. Therefore in some states there are now social programs for inmates with communities; education to be responsible for training a dog or a horse etcetera. This is still too little, maybe 2% of the inmates can and will take part in such a program.Personality transforminginvoluntary isolation practice of the incarcerated personor the mentally ill in a similar institution should be considereda crime against humanity in and by itself.Therefore it is proposed that any time in isolation must be restricted to extreme situations and cannot last longer than a few days. Consequentlythe pain; thecravings; frustration and (self) hatred must always be recognized by specialists and socially treated.Success in the fight for prevention; socialization andrehabilitation of all concerned.ReplyAlan CYA#65085March 19, 2011 at 1:55 pmGood work it has only been up for just a short time and has received 1357 recommends in spite of the outbreak of yet another middle eastern war in Libya, the Arab uprisings and the Japan nuclear crisis.Imagine if it had been a slow news day.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
