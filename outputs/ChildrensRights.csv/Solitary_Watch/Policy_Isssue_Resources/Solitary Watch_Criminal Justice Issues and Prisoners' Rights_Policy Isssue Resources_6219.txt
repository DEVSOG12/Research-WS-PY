As the fact sheet states, “The negative effects of solitary conﬁnement go far beyond immediate suffering, affect people in all areas of their lives, and can last long after individuals have returned to the general prison population or the free world.” However, “little attention has been given to the specific collateral consequences of solitary confinement. These consequences include the destruction of family relationships, lasting financial hardship, exclusion from work and educational programing, additional time behind bars, increased recidivism, and even shortened life spans.”The four-page document (available as a PDF) also includes comprehensive notes and resources.Download “Racism and Solitary Confinement: Solitary Watch Fact Sheet #1” (2022, PDF)Racism and Solitary Confinement: Fact Sheet #1 (New Series)The first fact sheet in the new series covers how racism in the U.S. punishment system plays out in relation to the use of solitary. As the fact sheet states, “The systemic discrimination that has led to the mass incarceration of people of color has replicated itself within solitary confinement. Behind bars, people of color are more likely to be perceived as a threat by staff and more likely to face serious punishments in comparison with their white counterparts. Both factors contribute to racial disparities in the use of solitary confinement.”The fact sheet also documents racial disparities in how mental illness is treated in the punishment system, and in responses to political activism by people of color. The four-page document (available as a PDF) also includes comprehensive notes and resources.Previous PublicationsDownload “Fact Sheet: Children in Solitary Confinement” (2015, PDF)Download “Fact Sheet: The High Cost of Solitary Confinement” (2011, PDF)Download “Fact Sheet: Solitary Confinement and the Law” (2011, PDF)Download “Fact Sheet: Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement” (2011, PDF)ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageHelp Expose the Hidden World of Solitary ConfinementAccurate information and authentic storytelling can serve as powerful antidotes to ignorance and injustice.
