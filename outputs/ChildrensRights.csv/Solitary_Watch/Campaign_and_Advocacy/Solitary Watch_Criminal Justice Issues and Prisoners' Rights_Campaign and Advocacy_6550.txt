Advocates David Fathi of the ACLU National Prison Project and Johnny Perez of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture (himself a survivor of solitary) discuss the importance of exposing—and ending—the senseless suffering caused by prolonged solitary confinement.Watch here:[su_youtube url=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPKYt_vc8AM” width=”896″ height=”504″]ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsACLU National Prison Project,Al Jazeera,National Religious Campaign Against Torture,NRCAT,Solitary WatchJean CasellaJean Casella is the director of Solitary Watch.
