According to a report by the Correctional Association, New York State has the highest rate of disciplinary segregation in the country, and one of the highest rates of isolated segregation in general. More recent data suggests that these rates may still be growing–despite efforts to exclude inmates with mental illness from the Special Housing Units, and even as the prison population in New York falls.All are welcome to attend, but advance notice is necessary. Details from the NYCLU’s announcement appear below.Prolonged Isolation in New York Special Housing Units (SHUs)The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) is a non-profit legal organization that seeks to defend and expand the civil rights and civil liberties of all New Yorkers, including individuals incarcerated in New York’s prisons.The NYCLU recently launched a project to investigate the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision’s (DOCCS) use of Special Housing Units (SHUs). As part of this project, the NYCLU has begun organizing a broad-based coalition, including prisoners’ rights and mental health advocates, family members of the incarcerated, and formerly incarcerated individuals, to coordinate efforts to raise awareness about and advocate for an end to the NY SHUs.The NYCLU will be holding its next coalition meeting on January 19th at 6 PM.
