The author writes, “Long periods of solitary confinement can result in loss of speech,” and quotes from a survey participant on the inside. “When you live in an environment where nearly everyone is hostile to you, you learn to say less and less until you arrive at the point where vocalization seems increasingly odd to you.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Communication Management Units,Pelican Bay State Prison,Republicans,Solitary Confinement,Texas death rowAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
