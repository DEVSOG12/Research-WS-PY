Panelists will also explore the legal framework for protecting prisoners and detainees from solitary confinement and strategies advocates and others are currently using to end its abusive use.Keynote byJuan E.

The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the General Assembly to his assessment that solitary confinement is practised in a majority of States. He finds that where the physical conditions and the prison regime of solitary confinement cause severe mental and physical pain or suffering, when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely, prolonged, on juveniles or persons with mental disabilities, it can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture. In addition, the use of solitary confinement increases the risk that acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment will go undetected and unchallenged.The report highlights a number of general principles to help to guide States to re-evaluate and minimize its use and, in certain cases, abolish the practice of solitary confinement. The practice should be used only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for as short a time as possible. He further emphasizes the need for minimum procedural safeguards, internal and external, to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsACLU,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Human Rights,Human Rights Council,Human Rights Watch,International Agreements,National Religious Campaign Against Torture,public events,Solitary Confinement,Specail Rapporteur on Torture,Supermax Prisons,Torture,UN,United NationsJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Let this dicussion and unveiling of the truth hidden behind our prison gates ring loud and long. We must bring to light how America has abandoned true rehabilitation of our inmates. Why do we hold our most seriously mentally ill in conditions which truly meet the definition of torture. Thank God almighty for all who are involved in this effort.ReplyJoshlynOctober 17, 2011 at 5:05 pmglad to see this is happening it is time we see this sick use of solitary as it is being used stoped may thare be light in the darknes of justiceReplyGlenn Thomas Langohr (@rollcallthebook)October 17, 2011 at 12:52 pmI am so grateful to God that awareness into this explosion of prisoner confinement in solitary SHU supermax is torture and missing compassion and redemption.
