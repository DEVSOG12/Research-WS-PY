The lockdown means that people are unable to leave their cells, congregate with others, or engage in the rehabilitative programming necessary to receive parole.• At least 200 people have gone on hunger strike at Eloy Detention Center, in Arizona, in response to the recent deaths of two detainees. Jose de Jesus Deniz-Sahagún is believed by advocates and detainees to have died in solitary confinement after being beaten by guards; ICE officials have maintained that he was found dead in his cell with no signs of injury.• The Marshall Project, in partnership with NPR News Investigations, released an investigation on those who are released to the street directly from solitary confinement. (Read Part 1 and Part 2 on the NPR website or access the project via the Marshall Project website.)• Kalief Browder, who spent three years on Rikers Island without ever being convicted of any crime, committed suicide. His death was first reported by The New Yorker. A vigil was held for Browder in front of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan.• A federal judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit challenging Virginia’s automatic placement of death row prisoners in solitary confinement. The Washington Post wrote an editorial supporting the suit moving forward.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Clinton Correctional Facility,Death Row,Eloy Detention Center,hunger strike,Kalief Browder,Marshall Project,NPR,Rikers Island,Solitary Confinement,VirginiaAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
