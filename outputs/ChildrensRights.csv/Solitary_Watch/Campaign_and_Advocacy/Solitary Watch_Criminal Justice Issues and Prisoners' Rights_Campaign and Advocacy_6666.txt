Wildin Guillen Acosta, who is undocumented, has been in federal custody since he was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on January 28. Supporters worry he is facing retaliation for being an outspoken, high-profile detainee.• A man incarcerated in West Virginia has alleged he was placed in solitary confinement after refusing to submit to medically unnecessary surgery on his penis, according to an article published in Think Progress. Last week, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed by the prisoner, Adrian King, who ultimately agreed to the surgery, which he claims has permanently scarred him.• About half a dozen people locked up in Wisconsin participated in a hunger strike to protest against their placement in long-term solitary confinement. One person participating, LaRon McKinley Bey, has been in administrative segregation for more than 25 years.• North Carolina prison officials announced plans to stop placing children 17 and younger in solitary confinement. “Today’s announcement shows once again that it is past due time for North Carolina to join 48 other states and finally raise the age of juvenile jurisdiction so that 16 and 17 year olds are no longer automatically sent to the adult criminal justice system but rather protected and given a chance to turn their lives around,” said the ACLU’s National Prison Project and five other groups in a statement released the following day.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Adrian King,Bridgewater State Hospital,hunger strike,juvenile solitary confinement,Kansas Supreme Court,LaRon McKinley Bey,Massachusetts,North Carolina,Pioneer Institute,Stewart Detention Center,West Virginia,Wildin Guillen Acosta,WisconsinAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
