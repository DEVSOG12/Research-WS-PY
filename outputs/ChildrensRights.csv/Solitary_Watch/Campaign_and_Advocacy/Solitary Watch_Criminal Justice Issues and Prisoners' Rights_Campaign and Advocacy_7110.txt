Where I spent mere weeks at a time others spent years or decades that is a huge difference. As far as speaking out I refer to my brother Victor that spent over a decade in the SHU often on here but he will never be able to testify in this world. As for my other brother Mike who has spent a year here and a year in the hole as a youth he has since lived under that rock Wilde refers to and is now about to die himself. With respect for them both I attempt to give them a voice on this forum in hope that my humble efforts will benefit others.ReplyLois DeMott- Co-Founder, Citizens for Prison Reform- MichiganJune 18, 2012 at 11:54 pmWe certainly feel for those of you who have lived in Solitary Confinement, and within the walls at all.We as families who have endured having a loved one that is or has been incarcerated may understand only minimally what the stigma is like out here.Then once you are released it never goes away.If we allow the stigma to take hold and keep us all silent, no change will be brought.I fear sharing what little truths I know from my son’s experience, and what those within our organization have experienced.Yet I know he and others, as well as myself can only use this horrific experience to shed light on the truths we know, and work to educate those around us who know so little of what is happening within this system of mass incarceration.I thank you for sharing and shedding brighter light on how this has affected your life back in the community.Our Nation should be shamed for its lack change and lack of progressiveness regarding social justice and humanity.“I committed a crime, so you locked me up and committed horrendous crimes against me”ReplyAlan CYA #65085June 18, 2012 at 10:48 pmI understand both of these last two remarks and let me say this I’m in no way being critical of your choice to remain silent. I didn’t submit a statement either because I didn’t want to taint my children with my past. Rather I fault the system for holding our past against us.I also like the cleaver names that you choose to use on here. Your obviously perceptive and bright. But if we don’t take a chance when such opportunities arise then will anything ever change? I do what I can on here without any reward other than the satisfaction of illuminating the hole so others can view it.I sell no books have no blog and seek no financial reward. I know the system can identify me but I hope potential employers cannot. So I participate with the full knowledge that others are using it as you describe and they even receive some funds to keep it going but at least they are attempting to do something for those we left behind. Maybe I’m a chump but that is a risk that I am willing to make. It is too bad that you and I feel that we need to hide our identity I bet you have a compelling story to tell and the ability to present it.ReplyP. WoodJune 18, 2012 at 4:09 pmLife after prison (or between trips) is isolating too. Even those activists, attorneys, Capitol-barnacles and former system actors who seek to reverse mass incarceration will treat a former prisoner in isolating ways- hugging your “experience” like you were a rich kid with the best toys, then relegating you to the bench like a fat kid when you venture to be anything more than a token “formerly incarcerated person.”And if they slip up, and you make it past the bench, they will despise you for anything you accomplish, and will seek to belittle you and re-cast you as that poor fool destined to tell sob stories in committee hearings. God forbid you might make a living fighting injustice, as they do.And people wonder why some of us are quiet about the fact that we’ve been to prison. I didn’t survive that hell so I could fuel your hubris, help you sell books, spice up your blog and make your c3 look cool at funder briefings. I survived, and as much as I’d like to help end mass incarceration, I’ll be preserving my ability to get on with my life by not letting you brand me as your revolutionary flag.ReplyGeorgie girlJune 18, 2012 at 4:05 pmEven nice, caring people treat former prisoners like tokens for their cause.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085June 18, 2012 at 12:19 pmThose still in the hole must be asking “Where are all the freed prisoners statements?”I don’t see any.Oscar Wilde wrote about life after prison:“Many men on their release carry their prison about with them into the air, and hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length, like poor poisoned things, creep into some hole and die. It is wretched that they should have to do so, and it is wrong, terribly wrong, of society that it should force them to do so.Society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual, but it also has the supreme vice of shallowness, and fails to realise what it has done. When the man’s punishment is over, it leaves him to himself; that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment when its highest duty towards him begins.It is really ashamed of its own actions, and shuns those whom it has punished, as people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot pay, or one on whom they have inflicted an irreparable, an irremediable wrong.”Therein lays the inner conflict and why the system gets away with all they do.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
