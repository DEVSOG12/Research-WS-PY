It is long past time for the Bureau of Prisons to reform its practices.” The lawsuit was covered by the Marshall Project and other outlets.• Connecticut passed legislation prohibiting the Department of Corrections from placing people under 18 in administrative segregation. According to the AP, “the bill also requires the DOC commissioner to study the use of restrictive housing for inmates and report back to the General Assembly by Jan. 1, 2019. Additionally, the agency must provide annual data on the use of restrictive housing and administrative segregation, commonly referred to as solitary confinement.” The legislation now goes to the desk of Gov. Malloy.• On any given day last month, an average of 27 children were placed in solitary confinement at Wisconsin’s prison for teens, according to records filed as part of a civil rights lawsuit. As the Journal Sentinel reports, “that represents more than 16% of the population at Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls, which share a campus 30 miles north of Wausau.”• Freed political prisoner and Puerto Rican independence activist Oscar López Rivera appeared on Democracy Now. He spent about 35 years locked up – including 12 years and four months in solitary confinement – before his sentence was commuted by President Obama. “ In ADX, for the first 58 days, I was awakened every half-hour, 58 days straight,” he said. “So that will give you an idea what it is to be in prison, to be under those conditions.”• In a feature story for Vice magazine, Solitary Watch contributor Aviva Stahl explores what transgender women experience in immigration detention, both in male facilities and in the now-shuttered trans “pod” in Santa Ana, California. “Before the pod existed, the de facto situation for the trans folks in immigration custody was to place them in administrative segregation,” Keren Zwick, said one immigration attorney, “which was a euphemism, effectively, for solitary confinement.” Another trans pod recently opened in a private detention facility in New Mexico.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,ADX,ADX Florence,children,Connecticut,Copper Lake School for Girls,DC Prisoners’ Project of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs,immigration detention,Lewisburg prison,Lincoln Hills School for Boys,Mental Illness,Oscar Lopez Rivera,Santa Ana City Jail,transgender women,WisconcinAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
