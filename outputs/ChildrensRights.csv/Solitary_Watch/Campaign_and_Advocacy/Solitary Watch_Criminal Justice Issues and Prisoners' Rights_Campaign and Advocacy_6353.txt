Since April 20, a special site-specific exhibition of Photo Request from Solitary has been at the Brooklyn Public Library, organized around the question, “What would someone in solitary confinement want to see?”During the exhibition period, project organizers encouraged viewers and others to create as many images as possible to fulfill open requests, and upload them to the project website. We received dozens of photographs, drawings, and Photoshopped images created for people in solitary confinement. A few samples appear below.On June 20, Brooklyn Public Library will host a finale event for the exhibition, which ends on July 1. A roundtable of artists, designers, advocates, and a survivor of solitary confinement will present requests and images and lead a discussion about the project, art and activism, solitary confinement, and mass incarceration, while celebrating the imagery made through a creative collaboration that spans prison walls. Participants who have filled requests during this exhibition are invited to come and present their work at the finale event.The event is free and open to the public, and all are welcome. Please come early or stay late to view the exhibition!

UFO said, “I would like a photo of New York, especially Brooklyn, I am more into the scenes of everyday movements in New York. The train, people going to work, pictures of food, especially pizza, fashion and the music scene, drummers on pale buckets, breakdancers, etc.”Noni, held in solitary in a Pennsylvania prison, asked for “a photo of a ‘Adult Male Lion & Four Cubs.’ It will represent: me as the father and my three sons and one daughter… because my family calls me ‘The Crying Lion’ and I love my kids — (my cubs) and I will protect them with my life. Please place 4 tear-drops under the right eye of the male adult lion and 1 tear-drop under each of the right eye of each cub… This is a must. Please!” Image by: Tiffany McillwainMiguel, who is in solitary in a California prison, asked to see “the pyramids of Chichén Itzá, in Southern Mexico, and art sculptures on or around the pyramids.” Image by: Susan DonovanYafis “Boo Rock,” held in solitary in Pennsylvania, requested to see “a photograph of the superhero Black Panther with the Philadelphia skyline behind him or the street sign of the block I lived on behind him (65th St + Greenway Ave).” Image by: StevenShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesPhoto Requests from SolitaryTagsActivism,art,New York,Photo Requests from Solitary,solitary survivor narrativesValerie KiebalaValerie Kiebala was a contributing writer and editorial and project manager for Solitary Watch, and is now the media director of Straight Ahead, which is building a decarceration movement throughout Pennsylvania.
