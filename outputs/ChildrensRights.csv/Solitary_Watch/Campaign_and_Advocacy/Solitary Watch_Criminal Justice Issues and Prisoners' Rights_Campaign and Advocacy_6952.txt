Referring to the hunger strike, Guenther writes, “It is precisely this collective action, and this promise of solidarity, that is criminalized by the CDCR in its deployment of “gang” rhetoric against individual prisoners and against the strike action as a whole.”•  Courthouse News Service reports that a Pennsylvania county jail may be held liable for failing to treat a man who was being held in isolation. Derek Black, whose repeated requests for medical assistance over a 2-week period were ignored by jail officials, “died after coughing up blood and suffering from chest pain for weeks in solitary.”• Scientific American reports on the overuse of solitary confinement in the US, noting that isolating prisoners inflicts irreversible mental damage.
