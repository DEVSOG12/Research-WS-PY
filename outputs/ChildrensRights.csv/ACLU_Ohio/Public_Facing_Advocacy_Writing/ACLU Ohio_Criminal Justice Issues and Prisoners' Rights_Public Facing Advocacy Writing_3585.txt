These four counties have contracts with ICE to detain immigrants, and the organizations contend that this partnership perpetuates a fear of immigration enforcement within communities, which can discourage immigrants and their family members from seeking necessary medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Cities and counties that collaborate with ICE by sharing information, participating in arrest operations, and holding individuals in jail in order to investigate their immigration status are placing their communities at greater risk for deadly consequences during the COVID-19 public health crisis. This partnership threatens our collective safety as Ohioans,” added Jocelyn Rosnick, Policy Director for the ACLU of Ohio.Specifically, the immigration advocates urge county officials to:Immediately suspend ICE collaboration (including contracts with ICE for civil immigration detention or partnerships that involve sharing information, investigation, arresting or delaying the release of individuals based on suspected immigration status);Cease the practice of holding individuals on immigration detainers and/or ICE warrants;Depopulate to mitigate risks, and release all detainees within the County-level jurisdiction;Publicly announce steps to implement these recommendations to build trust and confidence in immigrant communities.“Immigration detention should not be a death sentence. We urge county officials in Butler, Geauga, Morrow, and Seneca Counties to immediately adopt and implement our recommendations to save lives.”A copy of the letter is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesJuvenile JusticeDocumentspdfFINAL_Letter-for-County-Officials_04082020_1.pdfRelated contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ending the School-To-Prison Pipeline: A Case Study of Cincinnati...June 24, 2021Alarming New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack...April 22, 2021Introducing Our Columbus Police Contract Negotiation ToolkitMarch 12, 2021Dear Cleveland, We Need Bail Reform.
