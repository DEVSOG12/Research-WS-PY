Today, nearly a quarter of all prison inmates are serving time for drug offenses, and roughly half the inmates in state prisons are non-violent offenders.Eric Holder is not the first prominent leader to notice this problem. In Ohio, politicians are learning that although tough-on-crime rhetoric may have helped them get elected, the resulting policies have left their constituents hurting.Whether it’s the state of Ohio or the federal government, the basic economic failure Holder discusses comes down to simple math. Forty years of locking up nonviolent drug offenders has become expensive, especially when adding in the harsh collateral sanctions that make it nearly impossible for those coming out of jail to earn a living or support their families.It stands to reason that locking up fewer people and making it easier for those reentering society to get a job (and pay taxes) will save us all a lot of money. And saving money seems to be the one thing everyone can get behind.It’s harder to talk about the basic moral failure of our current model, i.e. the blatant, shameful racial disparity that is evident in our system of crime and punishment. It’s this failure that makes African Americans in our country over five times more likely to be sent to prison than their white counterparts and 10 times more likely to be sent to prison for a non-violent drug offense.These numbers illustrate more than failed economic policy; they are an affront to our most fundamental principles of equality under the law.But it doesn’t have to be this way.Our current situation is not inexplicable, nor is it irreversible. Everyday it becomes more and more obvious that we have created these problems through decades of counterproductive policy decisions.Maybe it’s finally time to try a different approach.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyRacial JusticeRelated contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022ACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
