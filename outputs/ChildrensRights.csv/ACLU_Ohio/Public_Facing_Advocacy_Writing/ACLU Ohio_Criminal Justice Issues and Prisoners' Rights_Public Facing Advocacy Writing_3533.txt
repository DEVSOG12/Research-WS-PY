And the State is garnishing his meager commissary account, ensuring he remains destitute,” she continued.Mr. Dunson works full time as a prison laborer, but at the cents-per-hour prison earning rate, he saves less than $40 monthly. The Montgomery County Court garnishes Mr. Dunson’s commissary account every single month, taking away virtually all of these earnings. It leaves Mr. Dunson unable to pay for basic necessities like medical co-pays, and personal hygiene items, and unable to save anything for his future when he is released from prison.“Saddling the people we incarcerate with unreasonable debt creates a barrier to reentry and makes life in Ohio’s prisons even more inhumane,” said Bonham.  “The State locked Mr. Dunson up and now is additionally—and unconstitutionally—extracting wealth from him and his family. This case highlights how our society creates conditions that keep people like Mr. Dunson in continuous cycles of poverty and incarceration.”The amicus brief was submitted on behalf of the ACLU of Ohio, the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.Read the full amicus brief.###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfOhio.v.Dunson-ACLUOfOhioAmicusBrief-2018_0206.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
