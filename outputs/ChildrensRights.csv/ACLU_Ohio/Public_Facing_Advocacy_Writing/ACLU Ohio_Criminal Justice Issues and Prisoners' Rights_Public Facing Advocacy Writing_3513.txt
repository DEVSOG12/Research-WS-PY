Bennett Guess, Executive Director of the ACLU of Ohio:"Since CLJC's inception, the ACLU of Ohio has been a close partner in supporting its mission to unite those who share a common interest in the law's constitutive and formative role in cultural, political, and social life. The potential loss of this substantive university offering, at a time of great partisan divide, political incivility. and legislative gridlock would have serious confounding consequences for our society, state, and nation. This is a profoundly wrong move at exactly the wrong time in the life of Ohio University and our democratic republic. Under Mr. Larry Hayman's leadership, CLJC has flourished, playing a crucial role in the development of curious legal minds, and setting up students for success. CLJC's supportive groups and innovative programs have especially uplifted students of color and those who are economically disadvantaged."Read the letter below.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesStudents RightsRacial JusticeDocumentspdfLetter to Ohio University Provost and Dean - Center for Law, Justice, and Culture Program - 3/24/21Related contentWhen Does Childhood End?September 26, 2022How a Unicorn and a Six Year Old Saved My LifeSeptember 20, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022As if COVID Wasn’t Enough: A Continuous Assault on Student’s Rights...April 30, 2022Ahead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022House Bill 607 - Opponent TestimonyApril 6, 2022House Joint Resolution 2 - Opponent TestimonyApril 6, 2022Young Activists CoalitionMarch 22, 2022Defending Our Right to LearnMarch 17, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
