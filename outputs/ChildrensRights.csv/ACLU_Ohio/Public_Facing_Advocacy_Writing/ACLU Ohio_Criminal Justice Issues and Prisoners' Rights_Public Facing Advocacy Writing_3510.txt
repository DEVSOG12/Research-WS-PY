The settlement follows a multi-year litigation effort.“There is no way to put a price on this kind of trauma. But we welcome the measure of accountability that this settlement represents and we are grateful to partner with our client in demanding that accountability. This behavior from the Columbus Police is wrong and it has always been wrong,” said Elizabeth Bonham, Staff Attorney for the ACLU of Ohio.Recently the ACLU of Ohio joined a coalition of legal and advocacy organizations in formally requesting the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the Columbus Police Department’s history of violence and misconduct targeting Black people.The case was originally filed in July 2017.A copy of the settlement agreement and joint notice of settlement and proposed order are below.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesPolice PracticesRacial JusticeDocumentspdfAbdur-Rahim v.
