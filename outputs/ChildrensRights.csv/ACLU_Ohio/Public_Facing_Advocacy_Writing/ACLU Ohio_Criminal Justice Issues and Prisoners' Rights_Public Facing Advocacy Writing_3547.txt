Five Ohio prison inmates who wish to share their perspectives on the Lucasville uprising are also included as plaintiffs.Prison officials have claimed that they deny these media requests because the inmates in question are at the highest prison security level, and thus ineligible for in-person interviews. However, they have repeatedly granted similar interview requests for other prisoners at the same security level—including other death row inmates—who were not involved in the Lucasville uprising.“Prison officials are not denying these interview requests based on security,” said Hardiman. “They are denying them based on what they think the inmates are going to say.”“The Lucasville prison uprising dominated state and national news for weeks in 1993, and twenty years later, it is undeniably still a major area of interest for the press,” added ACLU of Ohio Senior Staff Attorney Freda Levenson. “Not only does the public have a right to know what is happening inside our prisons, the prisoners inside these facilities also have a right to share that information with the outside world.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesFree SpeechGeneral Civil LibertiesPrisoners' RightsRelated contentHow a Unicorn and a Six Year Old Saved My LifeSeptember 20, 2022FAQ: Power of Ohio Secretary of StateJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of State RepresentativeJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of State SenatorJuly 14, 2022ACLU of Ohio Sends Demand Letter to Buckeye Valley Board of...July 14, 2022Speak Up, Ohio, We're Listening!
