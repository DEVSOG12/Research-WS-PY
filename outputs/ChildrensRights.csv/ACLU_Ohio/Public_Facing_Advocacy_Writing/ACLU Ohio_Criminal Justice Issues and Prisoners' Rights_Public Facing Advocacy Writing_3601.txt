ACLU of Ohio released a statement regarding the positive impact this announcement could have on the future of prisons for profit in Ohio. The following statement is attributable to J. Bennett Guess, Executive Director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio:"For-profit prisons only create incentives for corporations to lobby for more laws to criminalize more people and feed our already bloated criminal justice system. By taking proactive steps to divest, the Cincinnati City Council will ensure that the pension funds of hard-working city employees and retirees are not being used to perpetuate a mass incarceration scheme and human rights disaster. The ACLU of Ohio applauds Cincinnati's bold, courageous national leadership toward ending the profiteering of imprisonment."###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeGeneral Civil LibertiesPolice PracticesPrisoners' RightsRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022FAQ: Power of State SenatorJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of Ohio Secretary of StateJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of State RepresentativeJuly 14, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
