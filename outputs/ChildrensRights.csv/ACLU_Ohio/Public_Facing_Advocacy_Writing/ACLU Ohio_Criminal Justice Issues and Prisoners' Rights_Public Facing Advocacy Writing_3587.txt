If so, how many? Which facilities?Are there any suspected cases of COVID-19 in any DRC/DYS facilities? If so, how many? Which facilities?Is anyone in a DRC or DYS facility being quarantined? If so, how many? Which facilities? How/under what conditions?“Many Ohioans are understandably extremely worried about loved ones who are incarcerated. They are desperately seeking as much information as possible.  It is time for Ohio’s leaders to be proactive in publicly disseminating information on an ongoing, daily basis.  In times of crisis, transparency and sharing of knowledge is key. Ohioans expect no less,” added Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio.The full letter is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdfLtr_COVID19_03242020.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
