The ballot initiative, the Ohio Crime Victims Bill of Rights (OCVBR) or Marsy’s Law, will amend the state Constitution to erode important due process protections, including prevention of the accused from obtaining evidence and allowing victims to interject at all stages of a trial.“Our legal system has a responsibility to uphold the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty,’ and if passed this law will fundamentally change the nature of criminal proceedings,” said Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio. “The ACLU fully supports the enforcement of existing legal protections for victims, but this law would negatively impact the accused’s constitutional right to due process. Cooperation by both parties is essential to a fair trial, but this proposed amendment will threaten due process for those still presumed innocent.OCVBR will allow victims to refuse interviews, depositions, or other discovery requests made on behalf of the accused. Additionally, OCVBR will allow victims to intervene at various phases of the criminal proceedings and eliminate judicial oversight of the victim’s participation, threatening the fundamental rights to fairness and a speedy trial. “The consequences will be felt systemically as well as individually. This initiative will result in longer prison sentences and higher incarceration rates, and will bolster the state’s power over the accused,” added Daniels.“Ohio’s criminal justice system is already overburdened, and OCVBR will deepen those existing systemic failings. Most everyone can agree that protecting and aiding victims is a worthy goal, and Ohio could do better. However, we cannot achieve that by simultaneously depriving the accused of their constitutional rights,” concluded Daniels.The ACLU of Ohio stands in opposition to State Issue 1 and encourages a “no” vote.###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeGeneral Civil LibertiesRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022FAQ: Power of Ohio Secretary of StateJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of State RepresentativeJuly 14, 2022FAQ: Power of State SenatorJuly 14, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
