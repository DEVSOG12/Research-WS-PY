The CIIC is a legislative committee that inspects prisons around the state and publishes reports on how they are functioning.“Considering most Ohioans know little about the operation of our prison system, CIIC is typically one of the best resources for information about what is happening in a given prison, or overall in the state system,” explained Mike Brickner, senior policy director.“That power will now largely be curtailed at a time when we will see record numbers of prisoners as early as July 2016. This is appalling and a huge impediment to ensuring prisoners are treated humanely and constitutionally,” he concluded.Read the ACLU of Ohio’s letterRead the letter from Disability Rights OhioRead the letter from the Juvenile Justice CoalitonRead the press release from the Ohio Justice & Policy CenterRead the letter from the Office of the Ohio Public Defender###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticePrisoners' RightsDocumentspdfLetterToOGA-ReChangesToCIIC2016_0525.pdfpdfDRO-StatementOnCIICAmendment2016_0525.pdfpdfJJC-StatementOnCIICAmendment2016_0525.pdfpdfOJPC-StatementOnCIICAmendment2016_0525.pdfpdfOPD-StatementOnCIICAmendment2016_0525.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
