The State began the procedure at 10:00 a.m. However, more than an hour and a half later, it was reported that the executioners were unable to locate a vein. Yet, the State continued to try.On May 2, 2006, Ohio executed Joseph L. Clark after a lengthy delay resulting from a collapsed vein.“Having one botched execution is too many; that Ohio has now had two botched executions in as many years is intolerable,” Davis concluded.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
