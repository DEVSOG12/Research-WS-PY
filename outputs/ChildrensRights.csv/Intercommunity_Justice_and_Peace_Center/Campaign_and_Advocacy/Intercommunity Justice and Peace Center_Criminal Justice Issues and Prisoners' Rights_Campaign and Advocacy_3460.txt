Pierre also clerked for appellate judge David Nelson on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, where he gained first-hand knowledge of the appellate process.Darlene Rogers – Criminal Justice ReformMs. Rogers lives in Anderson Township and began her career in nearby Mt. Washington as a teacher for McNicholas High School where she led and mentored high school students. Even though teaching was such rewarding work, she felt a higher calling to a different path of public service and chose to attend law school. After becoming a lawyer, it was a small step to again work with children, but this time defending them in court as a Hamilton County Public Defender in the Juvenile Division. It was at the Public Defender’s office that Ms. Rogers’ observed more injustice than she ever believed possible. She routinely witnessed disparate bonds, plea deals and sentencing based upon race, wealth and entitlement. These experiences are why she now sounds the alarm for the urgent need for Criminal Justice Reform.Lacey Elizabeth Hopkins – AMOS ProjectThe AMOS Project, along with the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, is working to radically reduce the prison population through impactful criminal justice reform. Some of you may have already heard about the Safe and Healthy Communities Campaign and the push to get an initiative on the November Ballot that is for the people, by the people. We’d LOVE to have your involvement in the signature collection process and all that that entails.Sister Andrea Koverman: – The Death PenaltySr. Andrea Koverman is a newly vowed member of the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati who can be found gardening, hiking, or rollerblading whenever time and weather permit. She was born in southern Texas, raised outside of Dayton, OH.
