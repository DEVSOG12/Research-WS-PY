The Death Lottery:
How Race and Geography 
Determine Who Goes to
Ohio’s Death Row
OHIOANS TO
   STOP EXECUTIONS1 Introduction
In 1998, the General Assembly enacted section 109.97 of the Ohio Revised Code to “require the 
Attorney General to annually prepare and file with specified individuals a capital case status report.”1   
The Annual Capital Crimes Report is a valuable source of information. It contains vast amounts of 
quantitative data and pertinent sections of the Ohio Revised Code that provide the reader with 
information about the history, use, and legal provisions related to Ohio’s death penalty; however, 
the Atorrney General’s report lacks a fuller, qualitative look at the people and cases upon which the 
report is built. Accordingly, Ohioans to Stop Executions (OTSE) offers this report to provide context 
and detail to complement the numbers and statutes provided in the Annual Capital Crimes Report.
Perspectives presented here are those of Ohioans to Stop Executions unless otherwise explicitly 
stated. All research done in this report has been performed and compiled by OTSE. This report was 
developed using information available from the following sources: Office of the Attorney General, 
the Ohio Supreme Court, the Ohio Supreme Court Joint Task Force to Review the Administration 
of the Death Penalty, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, the Office of the Ohio 
Public Defender, the Office of the Federal Public Defender, Southern Division, and the Office of the 
Federal Public Defender, Northern Division. 
 Executive Summary
The title of this new report from Ohioans to Stop Executions, “The Death Lottery: How Race and 
Geography Determine Who Goes to Death Row,” says it all. The numbers speak for themselves. 
While Ohio’s overall use of the death penalty is slowing, it has become more apparent than ever 
before that the race of the victim and location of the crime are the most accurate predictors of death 
sentences in the Buckeye State.
When looking at all capitally-indicted murders across Ohio over the history of the current statute, 
40% of capital indictments come out of Cuyahoga County. Two-thirds of all Ohio murder victims are 
people of color, yet in 2013 three out of four new death sentences were for the murder of White 
people. Since executions resumed in Ohio nearly 77% have been for the murder of White people. 
These statistics belie the words carved into the face of the U.S. Supreme Court building: “Equal 
Justice Under Law.” 
Even as the numbers demonstrate drastic disparities in its use, the data available from the Ohio 
Supreme Court, the Ohio Attorney General, the Office of the Ohio Public Defender and others 
demonstrates convincingly that Ohio’s use of the death penalty is in decline.
Ohio prosecutors filed the fewest number of capital indictments in 2013 since the death penalty was 
reinstated in 1981.2 According to the Ohio Supreme Court Clerk’s Office, 21 death penalty cases 
were filed in 2013, down 28% from 2012 and down 63% from 2011.
Four new death sentences were issued in 2013.3 This decrease continues a steady decline in death 
sentences since Life Without Parole first became a sentencing option in Ohio in 1996.2 Capital Indictments in 2013
Capital indictments in Ohio continue to decline significantly. When the death penalty returned in 
1981, capital indictments soared to 1,288 over the subsequent ten years. However, indictments have 
declined 53.6% since that initial surge. 
In 2013, capital indictments hit an all-time low since the death penalty’s reintroduction. Twenty-one 
new indictments were filed, indicating a 28% decline from 2012 and a 63% decline from 2011.Even though 320 death sentences have been assigned in Ohio, a significant number of those cases 
never conclude in the execution chamber. Six men were scheduled for execution in 2013, but only 
three executions took place.4 One condemned inmate received a sentence commutation (from 
Death to Life Without Parole);5 another received a seven-month reprieve;6 and one condemned 
inmate committed suicide days before his scheduled execution.7
The decline in death penalty cases cannot be explained by a single factor. This decline may be 
attributed to factors ranging from available county resources and the exorbitant cost and duration 
of capital cases to the changing attitudes of Ohioans toward the death penalty and three decades 
of experience administering the ultimate punishment. No matter the reasons for the decline, there 
is growing consensus by death penalty experts that Ohio’s death penalty is in need of significant 
reforms.  
In October 2013, Ohio changed its execution protocol for the sixth time in four years. The new 
procedure includes a lethal dose of Pentobarbital acquired from a manufacturer, distributor or 
compounding pharmacy. These frequent changes by the State are a clear indication of two things: 
one, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction personnel have difficulty adhering to written 
protocol and procedures; and second, obtaining drugs to execute prisoners presents an ongoing 
problem for which there is no permanent solution in sight.   
The Supreme Court of Ohio and the Ohio Bar Association concluded a two-year review of the death 
penalty system in November 2013. The outcome of this joint project is soon expected to produce a 
report outlining needed recommendations to address Ohio’s long-standing deficiencies. This report 
will likely confirm what the American Bar Association found in a 2007 assessment: Ohio fails to meet 
93% of the guidelines to ensure fairness and accuracy in its death penalty system.
As a result of Ohio’s inability to administer the death penalty fairly and without error, a growing 
consensus of prominent Ohioans has concluded Ohio is no longer well-served by the death penalty. 
Noteworthy individuals expressing concern include Ohio Supreme Court Justice William O’Neill, 
retired Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton and current Lucas County Prosecutor Julia Bates.
Time will tell whether Ohio leaders are willing to address issues of fairness and accuracy raised by 
the American Bar Association and confirmed by the Joint Task Force to Review the Administration of 
Ohio’s Death Penalty. 
Ohio Supreme Court Justice Paul Pfeifer, author of Ohio’s current death penalty statute, now calls 
the death penalty in Ohio “The Death Lottery,” and urges its repeal. This report is intended to give 
Ohioans additional perspective as our state continues to tinker with the machinery of death.3Each of Ohio’s 88 elected county 
prosecutors is given the authority to 
make charging decisions in criminal 
cases. With regard to the use of capital 
punishment, each county prosecutor has 
sole discretion whether or not to seek 
the death penalty in a case that would 
be death-eligible. That is, if a murder is 
committed and contains one or more 
of the aggravating factors enumerated 
in Ohio Revised Code 2929.04, the 
county prosecutor has the discretion to 
seek a capital indictment or to seek a 
noncapital indictment. If an indictment 
does not include a death penalty 
specification, then the death penalty will 
not be available for that case – even if 
aggravating factors were present. For 
instance, in a robbery-murder situation, 
one prosecutor could charge a defendant 
with aggravated robbery and involuntary 
manslaughter, which could lead to a 
maximum sentence of seven to twenty-five years on the victim’s death; while another prosecutor on 
the same facts could charge aggravated robbery and simple murder which could lead to a maximum 
sentence of 15 years to life on the victim’s death; yet another prosecutor in another county could 
charge on the same facts aggravated murder with an aggravating circumstance (a felony-murder 
specification), that could lead to a death sentence. As a result of this unfettered prosecutorial 
discretion, crimes with similar circumstances may be charged differently from one county to another 
and even from one case to another within the same county.
OTSE draws attention to those counties which most frequently employ the death penalty system in 
criminal cases. Historically, those counties are Cuyahoga (1254 indictments), Franklin (497), Hamilton 
(176), Lucas (131), Summit (109), Mahoning (102), Stark (78), Trumbull (58), Clark (56) and Butler (50).8
Cuyahoga County had fewer capital indictments in 2013 (4) than in any year during the modern 
death penalty (1981-present). In 1983, Cuyahoga County filed 82 capital indictments. Thirty years 
later, the county filed four. Even within one county, the 
subjectivity of varying prosecutors demonstrates a vast 
discrepancy in the number of capital indictments from 
year to year. Cuyahoga County is an example of the 
difference a new prosecutor can make in the number 
of capital indictments. Data from the county, which 
historically contributed the overwhelming majority of 
new capital indictments, shows the death penalty is 
sought much less often under the current prosecutor. The 
past three years further demonstrate a dramatic decline 
in indictments, with 23 in 2011, 11 in 2012 and only four 
in 2013.Capital Indictments in Ohio9

Total 
Indictments3168 100.00%4Current Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty 
publicly stated he would take a different approach to using the 
death penalty than his predecessors.
Prosecutor McGinty told the Cleveland Plain Dealer  in May 
2013, “I don’t want to waste the victim’s time, the police time, 
the court time, the prosecutor’s time and all those resources 
chasing down a case that won’t win that won’t uphold…I want 
to get the right case that deserves it and can be upheld. Those 
are very few.”10 Prosecutor McGinty went so far as to form a 
special review committee to reexamine older death penalty 
cases. As a result of this review committee, the Cuyahoga 
County prosecutor joined defense attorneys in a request for 
executive clemency for Billy Slagle in July 2013. The rationale 
the prosecutor provided was that the offense took place in the 
1980’s and that if the case were brought in 2013, under the 
same facts and circumstances it would not proceed as a death 
penalty case.11
This example shows the variation within the same county under 
different prosecutors. Though the defendant and facts of the 
case did not change, the policy of the prosecutor did and the 
outcomes could not be more divergent. 
Franklin County’s current prosecutor, Ron O’Brien, was elected 
in 1996. In his first year as county prosecutor, Franklin County 
filed 58 death penalty indictments, more than any Franklin 
County prosecutor in the modern era. During Prosecutor 
O’Brien’s first eight years in office (1997-2004), Franklin County 
averaged 30 capital indictments each year. More recently, from 
2005-2013, Franklin County averaged just over 2 death penalty 
indictments each year. 
Franklin County’s track record shows 
that even within the same county, 
the same prosecutor may change the 
approach taken with death penalty 
cases. Were there many more death-
eligible homicides in Columbus from 
1997-2004 warranting the higher 
number of indictments? Since there 
were no indictments filed in Franklin 
County in 2012 or 2013, were Capital Indictments

Murder Rate and Capital Indictment Comparison12
Do capital indictments track homicides across Ohio? While both 
have decreased over time, there is no clear correlation between 
the two. Sometimes, as it was between 1990-1993, Ohio‘s 
counties watch their indictments fall while homicides rise.5there zero death-eligible 
homicides in those years? 
The key question is  what 
has changed in Franklin 
County?
Hamilton County’s 
prosecutor Joseph T. 
Deters uses strict criteria 
for death penalty cases. 
The first criterion considers 
whether there are any 
“proof problems.” If there 
are proof problems, the 
case may not proceed 
as a death penalty case. 
The second criterion is 
that once the decision to 
seek death is made, there 
is no plea bargaining or 
reconsideration of the 
indictment. Compared to 
previous Hamilton County 
prosecutors, Mr. Deters has 
sought the death penalty 
in fewer instances but 
Hamilton County has the highest death penalty conviction rate in the state at 34.7%.
In 2013 capital indicting counties were Summit (6 indictments), Cuyahoga (4), Mahoning (2), Shelby 
(2), Hamilton (1), Stark (1), Montgomery (1), Richland (1), Ottawa (1), Mercer (1) and Allen (1).13Population and Capital Indictment Comparison
Do variations in population account for varying capital indictment counts 
in counties across Ohio? The numbers don‘t add up. While Cuyahoga 
County‘s population is only 11.09% of Ohio‘s total population, the county 
accounts for almost 40% of the capital indictments filed in Ohio.

that is, it falls outside the scope of criteria for 
eligibility for the death penalty in the criminal 
justice system. Judges and juries are not 
permitted to consider the victims’ race in death 
penalty cases; however, the data indicate that the 
race of the victim does matter in Ohio’s death 
penalty system. 
Where crimes of executed men involving 
White murder victims occurred, 40 of 52 
(76.92%) executions have been carried out.14 
Comparatively, crimes of executed men 
involving Black murder victims occurred in 
14 of 52 executions or 26.92% of the time.15                                                      
And for crimes of men executed where the murder 
victims’ race is identified as “other,” executions took 
place in 4 of 52 (7.69%) cases.16 This information 
includes four instances where victims of more than 
one race were involved.
Under Ohio’s current death penalty law, 320 death 
sentences have been issued. White murder victims 
were killed in 222 of 320 cases resulting in a death 
sentence (69.4%).17 Black murder victims were 
killed in 96 of 320 cases (30%) resulting in death 
as the sentence.18 Where the race of the victims’ is 
identified as other than Black or White, 10 of 320 
cases (3.13%) resulted in a capital conviction.19 Impact of Race of Victim
In Ohio death penalty cases where only a single murder victim was involved, 161 sentences were 
issued when the victim was White compared to 56 where only a single murder victim was Black. In 
crimes where a single murder victim was identified as other than Black or White, 10 sentences were 
issued.20
Ohio’s death penalty system runs contrary to race of victim demographics. In Ohio, homicide victims 
are African American or people of color 66% of the time.21Victims, by Executions

Frederick Treesh
Convicted of the 1994 murder of Henry Dupree, Frederick Treesh of Lake County was executed 
on March 6, 2013. In the dissenting opinion of Frederick‘s initial appeal, Judge O’Neil wrote that 
the police failed to properly advise Mr. Treesh of his Miranda  rights and that the state would not 
have been able to disprove mitigating factors without the inferences drawn from the improperly 
obtained statements.23 In the clemency proceedings, Mr. Treesh‘s lawyers argued that the police 
interrogated him when he was obviously high on crack cocaine.24 Additionally, they highlighted the 
disparity of sentencing between their client and his co-defendant, Benjamin Brooks, who received 40 
years to life.25 Lawyers cited an evolving national trend away from death sentences and questioned 
whether or not this would have been a death penalty case in today’s court and noted that their 
client suffered from Attention Deficiency/Hyperactivity Disorder which was compounded by his 
crack cocaine abuse.26 Although Mr. Treesh was sentenced to death for the murder of Henry Dupree, 
the family members of a different alleged victim, Gus Danno, were allowed to make statements at 
the clemency hearing and to attend the execution.27 He had never been tried or convicted for the 
murder of Gus Danno in Michigan.  
Frederick Treesh was pronounced dead at 10:37 a.m.28 Executioners needed a couple of tries before 
they were able to insert the IVs into Mr. Treesh‘s arm through which he received a single powerful 
dose of Pentobarbital.29 Mr. Treesh was 48 years old when he died – more than 18 years after he was 
sentenced to death.
Steven Smith
Convicted of the 1998 murder of Autumn Frye, Steven Smith of Richland County was executed on 
May 1, 2013. During the clemency proceedings, lawyers argued that Mr. Smith was significantly 
impaired by alcohol at the time of the crime – his blood-alcohol content was 0.123 eight hours 
after the victim died and was estimated by experts to be as high as 0.6 at the time of the crime.30 
Lawyers further argued that he did not intend to kill the victim.31 Intent to cause death is one of the 
elements of aggravated murder.  Expert testimony revealed that death by asphyxiation could have 
occurred within three to five minutes as an accidental result of Mr. Smith being on top of the victim.32 
Additionally, lawyers argued that Mr. Smith was an alcoholic who was good with children and had a 
shattered childhood.33 According to his lawyers, because Mr. Smith was not charged with rape, the 
jury faced a decision of convicting him of murder or nothing at all.34
Steven Smith was pronounced dead at 10:29 a.m. at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility.35 Mr. 
Smith was 46 years old at the time of his death.36
Harry Mitts, Jr.
Sentenced to death for the 1994 murders of John Bryant and Garfield Heights Police Sargent Dennis 
Glivar, Harry Mitts, Jr. of Cuyahoga County was executed on September 25, 2013. Mr. Mitts told the 
Ohio Parole Board that at the time of the crime, he was distraught over his divorce, was drinking 
heavily, and he wanted the police to shoot him.37 He explained that in his mind Sgt. Glivar, who 
was shot while using his body to shield a woman and her young son from the gunfire, was a hero 
and that he has felt great remorse for 19 years for killing the victims.38 Mr. Mitts said he found God 
while he was in the Cuyahoga County Jail and that he has tried to spread God’s word to others.39 He 
told the board that Sgt. Glivar’s mother and sister gave him a Bible and read a letter in which Sgt. 
Glivar’s mother and sister state that they forgive him and encourage him to seek forgiveness from 10God.40 Mr. Mitt‘s clemency lawyer told the parole board that he had been abandoned and betrayed 
by the lawyer who handled the trial and that the trial was a calamity.41 He emphasized that Mr. Mitts 
accepted responsibility for his crimes, is a good man, and he should not be another in a long line of 
inmates executed as part of a broken system.42
Harry Mitts walked into the death chamber at 10:05 a.m. He then received the last available dose of 
Pentobarbital and was pronounced dead at 10:39 a.m. Mr. Mitts was 61 years old at the time of his 
death.43
Clemency/Commutation
Ronald Post
Sentenced to death for the 1983 murder of Helen Vantz, Ronald Post was schedule to be executed 
on January 16, 2013.  Instead, Governor Kasich commuted the sentence to Life Without Parole 
a month earlier.44 Although concerns were raised in lawsuits about whether or not the execution 
protocol would be able to accommodate his morbid obesity, that issue was not raised at the 
clemency hearing.  Mr. Post‘s lawyers instead focused on legal issues, specifically, ineffective 
assistance of counsel at trial and in post-conviction proceedings.45 Five of the eight participating 
parole board members voted to make a favorable clemency recommendation citing ineffective 
assistance of counsel.46 As the majority wrote in the parole report, “[we] find it impossible to 
overlook the glaring omissions, missed opportunities, and questionable decisions made by Post’s 
several attorneys.  The various deficiencies in Post’s representation, viewed in totality, call into 
question whether Post’s death sentence was imposed through the kind of just and credible process 
called for by a punishment of this magnitude.”47
On December 17, 2012, Governor Kasich granted executive clemency and commuted Mr. Post‘s 
sentence to Life Without Parole.48 In his press release, Governor Kasich stated, “Regardless of the 
heinous nature of their crime, a criminal defendant is entitled to an effective defense, especially 
in a death penalty case. The Parole Board’s conclusion is that Ronald Post did not come close to 
receiving such a defense. After my own careful review, I agree. Therefore I am ordering that he 
spend the rest of his life in prison with no possibility of ever getting out. This decision should not 
be viewed by anyone as diminishing this awful crime or the pain it has caused.”49 In response to 
complaints by the victim’s family, the governor later announced that he would personally notify the 
victims’ family members whenever he decided to grant clemency.50 Ronald Post was transferred to 
Franklin Medical Center, a prison hospital, on January 3, 2013; he died of natural causes on July 25, 
2013, at the age of 53 and after spending 30 years on death row.51
Ronald Phillips
Sentenced to death for the 1993 murder of Sheila Marie Evans, Ronald Phillips was scheduled to 
be executed on November 14, 2013.  Instead, on November 13, 2013 Governor Kasich granted 
a stay of execution so that medical experts could explore the feasibility of Mr. Phillips donating 
organs or tissues to his mother and possibly others.52 However, in March of 2014, Mr. Phillips‘ 
was denied the opportunity to donate his organs because the procedure would not allow him 
enough time to recover prior to his new execution, scheduled to take place on July 2, 2014.53 The 
governor’s temporary stay came after the parole board unanimously recommended against clemency 
despite the arguments by his lawyers that Mr. Phillips grew up in and was a product of an abusive, 
dysfunctional environment and that his trial lawyers failed to investigate his childhood for possible 
mitigation evidence.5411 Post-Conviction Developments
Ohio may be considered an active death penalty state, yet many cases that are capitally sentenced 
end in a result other than an execution. 
Capital cases that are appropriately charged, prosecuted, defended and adjudicated should show 
relatively low rates of reversal or post-conviction relief by courts of appeals.The figures, though, 
show the opposite, producing an almost one-quarter (25%) conviction reversal rate. At a minimum, 
40% of all death sentences handed down since 1981 resulted in some outcome other than 
execution.
According to the Ohio Attorney General’s 2013 Capital Crimes Report, 74 people have received 
post-conviction relief. 18 death sentences were commuted, and six men have been exonerated 
completely. 26 men died prior to execution including suicide, natural death, accidental death and 
other causes. Six individuals are pending re-sentencing, and there are 145 active death sentences. 
52 men have been executed as of December 31, 2013. The Ohio Attorney General’s 2013 report 
includes individuals who are pending re-sentence (6) as active death sentences because those 
offenders are housed on death row. There are 138 inmates currently under a sentence of death in 
Ohio.61Suicide

Sentenced to death for the 1987 murder of Mari Anne Pope, Billy Slagle committed suicide in his 
cell on August 4, 2013 – 3 days before his scheduled execution.  Mr. Slagle‘s clemency hearing was 
somewhat unusual in that the current Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, Timothy McGinty, joined his 
counsel in their request for clemency, noting that the case would not have been tried as a capital 
case today.55 Despite the fact that the county that obtained the conviction and sentence no longer 
supported the sentence and the vast amounts of mitigating evidence presented at the hearing, 
the Parole Board voted 6-4 on July 8, 2013, to give an unfavorable clemency recommendation.56 
Notwithstanding the close vote and the evidence in favor of commutation, Governor Kasich denied 
Mr. Slagle‘s request for clemency just 16 days later.57
Billy Slagle‘s suicide occurred about 36 hours after his lawyers learned about an old plea offer made 
by prosecutors that he was never told about.58 As reported in The Atlantic , “But just as no one 
evidently told Billy Slagle about the plea deal 25 years ago, no one was able to get to Slagle in time 
last month to tell him the news about the plea negotiations and the hope it represented. Thus this 
story of crime and punishment, of law and order, morphed into a work of Shakespeare: Billy Slagle 
killed himself for lack of hope, even though hope was careening toward him in the form of this 
material new information that cast doubt upon the fairness of his trial.”59
A review conducted by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction following his suicide 
found that several errors had been made in surveillance and protocol, including untrained guards on 
duty, tampering with video recording devices, and improper transfer of the body to an ambulance.6012Name of

Reginald JellsA three-judge panel of the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals held that 
Reginald Jells had ineffective legal counsel in the penalty phase of his 
trial and that prosecutors withheld certain evidence that could have been 
favorable to his defense. Mr. Jells was re-sentenced to 30 years to life.
Maxwell White Jr.The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the death sentence and 
ordered White to be resentenced. He was then re-sentenced to 30 years to 
life. As part of the agreement White will waive his right to ever again appeal 
his conviction or sentence.
 Ohio Changes Protocols Again
Ohio changed its execution protocol six times in the past five years.62
The changes to the execution protocol began when Ohio was unable to complete the execution of 
Romell Broom on September 15, 2009. The execution team failed to access his veins and after two 
hours, then-Governor Ted Strickland called the execution attempt to a halt. This remains the first and 
only time an execution process was halted in the United States since 1947. Romell Broom remains on 
death row to this day while litigation takes place as to whether the state of Ohio should be allowed a 
second execution attempt.
Following the failed execution attempt of Romell Broom, Ohio changed its protocol in November 
2009. The new protocol included a clause that stated, “Every effort shall be made to anticipate and 
plan for foreseeable difficulties in establishing and maintaining the intravenous (IV) lines.” The new 
protocol also made Ohio the first state to move from the traditional three-drug cocktail to one lethal 
dose of Sodium Thiopental.63
The protocol was amended again in November 2010, adding more components to the psychological 
debriefing process for prison staff following an execution. The updated protocol also gave the 
warden the authority to cut an inmate’s last statement short if it was deemed offensive to victims’ 
family members or witnesses.64
In February of 2011, the lethal injection procedure was revised to a single lethal dose of 
Pentobarbital rather than Sodium Thiopental.65
Not long after, in March 2011, the protocol was edited so that the IV insertion occurred in the 
execution chamber with closed circuit camera recording. The warden was also to accompany the 
execution team to confirm that the IV insertion went smoothly and the IV sites were undisturbed. The 
revised protocol also added that if an “appropriate medical professional cannot confirm that death 
has occurred, the curtain [allowing a view of the execution chamber] shall be reopened until an 
appropriate time has passed to reevaluate the offender.”66Details on Post-Conviction Relief in 201313US District Court Judge Gregory Frost granted a temporary stay of execution to Kenneth W. Smith 
in July 2011. The Court ruled that the state haphazardly enforces some of its execution policies. 
“Ohio pays lip service to standards it then often ignores without valid reasons, sometimes with 
no physical ramifications and sometimes with what have been described as messy if not botched 
executions,” Frost wrote.67 Governor John Kasich then granted reprieves to both Brett Hartman and 
Billy Slagle. The Governor said the postponement will allow the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation 
and Correction to fix problems found by Judge Frost.
In September 2011, the execution protocol was significantly rewritten to include “an auxiliary team 
member” or a physician to advise the execution team, the production of an execution timeline, 
as well as a clause that states, “…variations from the requirements of the policy directive may 
sometimes be necessary. Any member of the Execution Team who determines for any reason it 
is difficult, impractical, or impossible to strictly follow the procedures in this policy directive shall 
immediately report the same to the Warden or the Director.”68 In effect, the protocol concedes 
that even within the confines of the strictest protocol, changes may have to be made during an 
execution.
In November 2011 Reginald Brooks, 66, was executed after a series of same-day delays to allow 
Courts to make rulings on litigation. Parole Board documents show Brooks had a long history of 
serious mental illness before the crime for which he was convicted.69
More irregularities with the execution procedure used for Reginald Brooks led Ohio back to federal 
court. Judge Frost granted stays of execution to Charles Lorrain and Michael Webb in January 2012. 
The federal court criticized the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction for, again, not 
following its own written rules. Judge Frost accused the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and 
Correction of engaging in a “policy of sporadic adherence to the execution protocol that allows, if 
not endorses, institutional incompetence.”70
Reluctantly, the Court allowed executions to resume in April 2012. Judge Frost wrote, “The court 
14reaches this conclusion with some trepidation given Ohio’s history of telling this court what (they) 
think they need to say in order to conduct executions and then not following through on promised 
reforms.”71
In May of 2013 a lawyer representing the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction 
(ODRC) addressed the Joint Task Force to Review the Administration of Ohio’s Death Penalty. In his 
presentation, the attorney related that in 2013, Ohio’s supply of Pentobarbital would expire. He said 
the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction was seeking the Task Force’s help to produce 
a recommendation protecting physicians and compounding pharmacies against professional 
sanctions so they could participate in the execution process. ODRC’s intention was to purchase 
execution drugs from compounding pharmacies rather than obtain drugs from FDA regulated 
manufacturers. The Task Force formed a special subcommittee to explore the execution protocol, 
but made no recommendations during the review process. When ODRC announced its plan to 
incorporate doctors and pharmacies in the execution process, the Ohio State Medical Association 
refused to support the idea and cited the long-standing maxim that doctors pledge to do no harm. 
Participation in executions would violate the Hippocratic Oath.72
In October 2013, ODRC announced they would proceed with a new execution protocol using 
Pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies and a backup method of Hydromorphone and 
Midazolam. However, because sufficient quantities of Pentobarbitol could not be acquired, ODRC 
switched to the backup method two weeks after announcing the newest protocol. No state in the 
US or country in the world has ever used the combination of Hydromorphone and Midazolam for an 
execution. 
US District Judge Gregory Frost allowed the execution of Dennis McGuire to proceed in early 2014 
with the untested drugs.  The Court wrote, “There is absolutely no question that Ohio’s current 
protocol presents an experiment in lethal injection processes. The science involved, the new mix 
of drugs employed at doses based on theory but understandably lacking actual application in 
studies, and the unpredictable nature of human response make today’s inquiry at best a contest of 
probabilities…There is always a possibility of human error or unfortunate misadventure.”73
Ohio Supreme Court Justice William O’Neill called the death 
penalty unconstitutional in January 2013, when he dissented 
in an order setting an execution date for Jeffrey Wogenstahl, 
a Hamilton County man convicted of the 1991 murder of 
Amber Garrett.
Justice O’Neill wrote, “I would hold that capital punishment 
violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States and Article I, Section 9 of the Ohio 
Constitution. The death penalty is inherently both cruel and 
unusual and therefore is unconstitutional. Capital punishment 
dates back to the days when decapitations, hangings, and 
 Support for Repeal Grows15brandings were also the norm. Surely, our society has evolved since those barbaric days....To date, 
17 states and the District of Columbia have eliminated the death penalty altogether. It is clear that 
the death penalty is becoming increasingly rare both around the world and in America. By definition 
it is unusual.” He concluded, “The time to end this outdated form of punishment in Ohio has 
arrived. While I recognize that capital punishment is the law of the land, I cannot participate in what I 
consider to be a violation of the Constitution I have sworn to uphold.”74
Retired Ohio Supreme Court Justice Evelyn Stratton 
announced her opposition to the death penalty in June 2013. 
“I have evolved to where I don’t think the death penalty is 
effective.” She noted its failure as a deterrent and its inability 
to provide closure to victim’s family members. In closing she 
said, “I don’t have a moral inhibition...Overall, it’s just not the 
best way to deal with it on a number of different levels.”75 
Justice Stratton, a Republican, reviewed the cases of the 49 
inmates who were executed during her time on the court from 
1996 to 2011.
Julia Bates, the current Lucas County prosecutor, challenged 
the death penalty in an article in The Toledo Blade  in 
November of 2013.76 In the article, Prosecutor Bates stated, 
“If you’ve done a purposeful killing or a felony murder you 
can get life without parole — you can try it, plead to it — but 
we can get that, and we don’t have to go through what is 
torturous really.” 
Former Attorney General Jim Petro and his wife, Nancy, 
spoke to the Joint Task Force to Review the Administration 
of Ohio’s Death Penalty in August of 2013. At the meeting, 
the Petros raised their concerns about wrongful convictions 
and the possibility that innocent people are on death 
row. Jim Petro told the Task Force, “My simple standard 
is this: I believe society has the right to exact the ultimate 
punishment. I don’t have any moral objection to the death 
penalty,” noting his concerns are entirely practical. “It 
doesn’t work.”77
“Death-penalty cases are ‘torturous,’” she said, “for juries 
and judges charged with deciding whether someone should 
live or die, torturous for defense lawyers and prosecutors 
whose work really just begins when a defendant is convicted, 
torturous for victims’ families who must suffer through 15 to 
20 years of appeals, and torturous for defendants sitting for 
years in solitary confinement on Death Row. It just seems 
there ought to be a better way.”
Finally, at a luncheon for the Cleveland City Club in 
December 2013, the retired director of the Ohio Department 
16 Task Force Developments
Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, in conjunction with the Ohio State Bar 
Association, assembled a task force of death penalty experts in September 2011. The task force 
was created to “review the 2007 American Bar Association report titled ‘Evaluating Fairness and 
Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Ohio Death Penalty Assessment Report’ and offer an 
analysis of its findings; assess whether the death penalty in Ohio is administered in the most fair and 
judicious manner possible; and determine if the administrative and procedural mechanisms for the 
administration of the death penalty in Ohio are in proper form or in need of adjustment.”79
The Task Force was comprised of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, legislators and academics. 
These experts met and discussed the problems outlined by the ABA report. After two years of 
review, the Task Force concluded its work in November of 2013. A final report with approximately 60 
recommendations to address the identified problems is expected in the Spring of 2014.80
In their totality, the recommendations, if adopted, would reform the death penalty system in its 
application and administration. Some reforms could have an immediate impact on the fairness and 
accuracy of the death penalty system.
 Conclusion
Thirty-three years have passed since the death penalty was reinstated in Ohio under the legal 
precept of “guided discretion” as mandated by the United States Supreme Court in Gregg v. 
Georgia. Yet, Ohio’s death penalty system continues to demonstrate just as arbitrary an application 
as when the Court struck down the death penalty in 1972. Ohio lawmakers who resurrected the 
death penalty in 1981 intended the law to be for Ohio’s “worst of the worst offenders.” A careful 
analysis of the death penalty’s administration over three decades reveals that the race of the victim, 
the county in which a crime occurs and the views of the county prosecutor are far more predictive 
of death sentences than any other factors. The premise that Ohio’s death penalty is reserved for the 
“worst of the worst” offenders is a fallacy. It is, however, reserved disproportionately for those who 
kill White victims, who commit murders in select counties and those on death row who are unlucky 
enough to hit the death lottery.
The ongoing revisions to Ohio’s lethal injection protocol and procedures indicate a much larger 
problem than the state’s inability to follow its own rules and obtain execution drugs without resorting 
to experimentation. Ohio has not been able to consistently administer the ultimate punishment 
without error, misapplication or in a manner that sufficiently holds violent offenders accountable in 
the interest of justice. of Rehabilitation and Corrections, Terry J. Collins, spoke openly about his opposition to the death 
penalty.  The moderator of the discussion asked the former Director, who oversaw 33 executions 
during his career, why he has become a public opponent of the death penalty. Mr. Collins 
responded: “Every time I did an execution…that question remaining, ‘did we get this right?’ and 
knowing we have the greatest justice system in the world but we can still make mistakes. If you make 
a mistake and you execute someone, that’s it.”7817The Ohio Supreme Court Joint Task Force to Review the Administration of Ohio’s Death Penalty 
has largely concluded that the American Bar Association’s 2007 assessment and critique of the 
death penalty is valid. The recommendations expected by this Task Force underscore the litany of 
deficiencies in Ohio’s system warranting drastic changes. The disparity across counties amounts to a 
system that is grossly uneven in its application and administration. In the rare circumstances a death 
verdict is given, human errors, mistakes and extra-legal factors result in an alarming number of cases 
that are reversed or lead to some outcome other than an execution being carried out.
Any public policy that demonstrates such consistent unevenness in its application requires 
transformative changes. If fairness cannot be achieved in the application of the death penalty, the 
more effective and efficient criminal justice policy is repeal.18 Appendix
