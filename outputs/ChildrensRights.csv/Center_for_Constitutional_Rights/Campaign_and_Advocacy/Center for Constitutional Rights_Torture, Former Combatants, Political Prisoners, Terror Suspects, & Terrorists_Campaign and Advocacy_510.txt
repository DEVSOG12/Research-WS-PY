Nakhla and L-3 Services is a federal lawsuit against U.S.-based private contractor L-3 Services, Inc. (formerly Titan Corporation, now Engility) and Adel Nakhla, a former employee of Titan/L-3 Services, for their role in torture and other war crimes at Abu Ghraib and other prisons in Iraq. CCR filed the suit on behalf of 72 Iraqi civilians who were subjected to horrifying acts of torture at the hands of these contractors and certain government co-conspirators. This case is part of CCR’s effort to bring accountability for torture and other serious violations of international law arising out of the so-called “war on terror” and corporate human rights violations.CACI International, Inc. had initially been named as a defendant in this case but was dismissed early in the litigation. This private military contractor, however, is the subject of another CCR lawsuit, Al Shimari  v. CACI, a case brought on behalf of four Iraqi civilians who were tortured at the “hard site” in Abu Ghraib prison in 2003-2004. CCR previously litigated a case against CACI and Titan/L-3, Saleh v. Titan, for war crimes and torture, on behalf of 256 former Iraqi civilian detainees, which was dismissed in 2009.At Abu Ghraib and other prisons, our clients were subjected to heinous acts, including rape and threats of rape and other forms of sexual violence; electric shocks; repeated beatings; prolonged hanging from limbs; forced nudity; hooding; isolated detention; and being urinated on. They were also prevented from praying and otherwise abiding by their religious practices.The named lead plaintiff, Wissam Al-Quraishi, a father of three, was hung on a pole for seven days at the infamous Abu Ghraib “hard site” and subjected to beatings, forced nudity, electrical shocks, humiliating treatment, mock executions and other forms of torture during his incarceration at the prison. Mr. Al-Quraishi also witnessed the defendant Adel Nakhla forcibly holding down a fourteen-year old boy as his co-conspirator raped the boy by placing a toothbrush in his anus. Another plaintiff, Emad Khudhayir Shahuth Al-Janabi, almost had his eyes clawed out, was stripped naked and threatened with rape, was hung upside down until he lost consciousness, and was deprived of sleep for extended periods of time. Like the other Iraqi civilians in this lawsuit, Mr. Al-Quraishi and Mr. Al-Janabi were released after enduring torture and other serious mistreatment without being charged with any crime.This lawsuit was brought under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), which CCR has pioneered for decades as a tool to pursue redress for international human rights violations, and federal question jurisdiction. The complaint charged L-3 Services, Inc. and Adel Nakhla with violations of U.S. and international law, including torture; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; war crimes; assault and battery; sexual assault and battery; intentional infliction of emotional distress; negligent hiring and supervision; and negligent infliction of emotional distress.After years of litigation, a settlement was reached on October 10, 2012, marking the first positive resolution to a U.S. civil case challenging detainee treatment outside the United States in the larger “war on terror” context.For more information about accountability for torture by private military contractors, see CCR's factsheet.Case FilesL-3 Unopposed Motion for Extension of Time to Answer Amended Complaint Order Approving Voluntary Dismissal of Case En Banc Opinion Dismissing Appeal L-3 En Banc Opening Brief Plaintiffs' Opposition Brief Order Inviting U.S. Government to Submit Amicus Brief Amicus Brief of U.S. Government L-3's Response to U.S. Government Amicus Brief Plaintiffs' Response to U.S. Government Amicus Brief Amicus Brief of Professors of Civil Procedure and Federal Courts Amicus Brief of Retired Military Officers Amicus Brief of International Human Rights Organizations and Experts Amicus Brief of EarthRights International 1/27/12 Oral Argument Petition for Rehearing En Banc Order Requesting Defendants' Response Defendants' Response to Petition for Rehearing En Banc Order Granting Rehearing En Banc Order Dismissing Case Order Staying Proceedings Defendants-Appellants' Opening Brief Plaintiffs-Appellees' Brief Defendants-Appellants' Reply Brief Amicus Brief of EarthRights International Defendants-Appellants' Supplemental Reply Brief Order Denying Motions to Dismiss 3/9/09 Hearing Transcript L-3 Services Motion to Dismiss Memo in Support of L-3 Services Motion to Dismiss Adel Nakhla Motion to Dismiss Memo in Support of Adel Nakhla Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Opposition to L-3 Services' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Opposition to Adel Nakhla's Motion to Dismiss L-3 Services' Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss Adel Nakhla's Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss Motion to File Second Amended Complaint Second Amended Complaint Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue to Eastern District of Virginia Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue Defendants' Reply in Support of Motion to Transfer Venue Amended Complaint Complaint District Court~01.04.09 Plaintiffs' Opposition to L-3s Motion to Dismiss.pdf District Court~01.02.09 Plaintiffs' Opposition to Nakhla Motion to Dismiss.pdf District Court~01.26.09 Reply in Support of Defendant Adel Nakhla's Motion to Dismiss.pdf District Court~11.26.08 Defendant L-3 Services Motion to Dismiss and Request for a Hearing.pdf District Court~11.26.08 Defendant Adel Nakhla's Motion to Dismiss.pdf District Court~10.17.08 Defendant L-3 Services Reply for Transfer Venue.pdf District Court~10.02.08 Plaintiffs Opp to Motion to Transfer.pdf District Court~10.01.08 Memo in Support of Motion to Amend Complaint.pdf District Court~09.05.08 Amended Complaint.pdf District Court~09.08.08 Motion of Defendant L-3 Services to Transfer Venue.pdf District Court~06.30.08 Complaint.pdf District Court~01.26.09 Reply Memorandum in Support of Defendant L-3 Services Motion to Dismiss.pdf District Court~3.9.09 Trial Transcript (MD).pdf District Court~11.26.08 Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant L-3 Services, Inc.

L-3 files its en banc opening brief on November 23, 2011. Plaintiffs file their opposition brief on December 14, 2011, arguing first that the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, and then that there is no “law of war” immunity for torture, that L-3 is not entitled to derivative sovereign immunity, that state law cannot be wholly displaced through preemption or “battlefield immunity,” and that the political question doctrine does not bar the action. On December 20, 2011, retired military officers, professors of Civil Procedure and Federal Courts, and international human rights organizations and experts file amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs on jurisdiction and preemption issues. The U.S. files its amicus brief on January 14, 2012, in which it agrees with the plaintiffs’ argument that the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction, and submits that the district court should reconsider the preemption argument under the “combatant activities exception” and that, inter alia, there should be no preemption for acts of torture. L-3 files its response to the U.S. amicus brief on January 20, 2012. Plaintiffs file their response to the U.S. amicus brief on January 24, 2012.

He also finds that plaintiffs assert valid causes of action against a corporate defendant under the ATS.
