Obama Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: June 30, 2005Current Status Mr. Al-Bihani was transfered to Oman on January 17, 2017.Our Team:Pardiss KebriaeiPardiss KebriaeiClient(s) Ghaleb Al-BihaniSeptember 27, 2011Case Description Ghaleb Nasser Al-Bihani is a Yemeni citizen born in 1979 in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. In early 2002, Mr. Al-Bihani was transferred to Guantanamo, where he has been detained for well over a decade without charge. Mr. Al-Bihani has never been accused of having raised arms against the United States. He has been imprisoned since 2002 on the basis of allegations that he was an assistant cook for Arab forces supporting the Taliban in an Afghan conflict against the Northern Alliance before 9/11. Both the D.C. District Court and the D.C. Court of Appeals upheld his detention on this basis, and the Supreme Court refused to grant his request to hear his case in April 2011.In April 2014, Mr. Al-Bihani appeared before the Obama administration’s Periodic Review Board to demonstrate his efforts to prepare for a better future and his hopes for a new beginning. In May 2014, the Board approved Mr. Al-Bihani for transfer from Guantanamo, finding “credible his commitment to building a peaceful life” and determining that his continued detention was unecessary. He was transferred to Oman in January 2017 in the final days of the Obama administration.Read Mr. Al-Bihani's client profile here.Case FilesPRB DecisionAl-Bihani statement Personal Representative statementPardiss Kebriaei statement Yemen Foreign Ministry letter Medical opinion Booklist PRB hearing transcriptAl-Bihani’s petition for certiorari DC Circuit Opinion denying rehearing en banc Court of Appeals OpinionDistrict Court Memorandum Opinion Habeas corpus petition Amended habeas petition PRB hearing transcript.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersJanuary 17, 2017Mr. Al-Bihani istransfered to OmanJanuary 17, 2017Mr. Al-Bihani istransfered to OmanPress ReleaseCenter for Constitutional Rights Client Ghaleb Al-Bihani Released From Guantánamo to OmanMay 2014Government approves Mr. Al-Bihani for transferMay 2014Government approves Mr. Al-Bihani for transferThe Obama administration's Periodic Review Board approves Mr. Al-Bihani for transfer from Guantanamo and determines that his continued detention is unnecessary.Related FilesPRB DecisionApril 8, 2014Mr. Al-Bihani's status reviewed at his PRB hearingApril 8, 2014Mr. Al-Bihani's status reviewed at his PRB hearingPress ReleaseCCR Gitmo Client Seeks Approval for Release from New Review BoardRelated ResourcesPardiss Kebriaei Vlog on Ghaleb Al-Bihani, Periodic Review Board, April 2014Related FilesAl-Bihani statementPersonal Representative statementPardiss Kebriaei statementYemen Foreign Ministry letterMedical opinionBooklistPRB hearing transcriptSeptember 25, 2013Government notifies Mr. Al-Bihani of his upcoming Period Review Board (PRB)September 25, 2013Government notifies Mr. Al-Bihani of his upcoming Period Review Board (PRB)June 17, 2013Defense Department releases names of 48 detainees designated for indefinite detentionJune 17, 2013Defense Department releases names of 48 detainees designated for indefinite detentionIn response to a FOIA suit by The Miami Herald, the DOD releases the names of men deemed “too dangerous to release,” but ineligible for trial.
