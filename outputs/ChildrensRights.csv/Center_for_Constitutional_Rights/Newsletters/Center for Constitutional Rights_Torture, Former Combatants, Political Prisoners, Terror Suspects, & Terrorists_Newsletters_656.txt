Breaking News: Supreme 
Court Rules in Boumediene v. 
Bush/Al Odah v. U.S., Up- 
holds Detainees’ Rights 
 
In an historic decision, the U.S. Su-
preme Court ruled on June 12, 
2008, that Guantánamo detainees 
have a Constitutional right to a hear-
ing before a fair and neutral judge, 
in a legitimate court, to challenge 
their detention. In the case of Boume-
diene v. Bush/Al Odah v. U.S. , the 
U.S.’s highest court ruled that the 
provision of the Military Commis-
sions Act which suspended detain-
ees’ right to habeas corpus was un-
constitutional. 
 
This decision marks the third time that 
the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld 
the rights of Guantánamo detainees 
– in 2004 in Rasul v. Bush, and in 
2006 in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the 
court upheld detainees’ rights to 
challenge their detention under fed-
eral law and their rights under the 
Geneva Conventions. The Bush Ad-
ministration has, to date, resisted all 
of the high court’s decisions. 
 
Detainees’ attorneys will now act 
quickly to bring their clients’ cases 
before judges, as mandated by the 
court, and seek relief.

Charges Dropped Against 
Mohammad Al-Qahtani 
 
On May 13, 2008, the military com-
missions charges were dropped 
against Mohammad al-Qahtani, a 
Guantánamo detainee who was subject to extensively documented 
torture and cruel, inhumane and de-
grading treatment during interroga-
tions. The government had previously 
announced its plan to seek the death 
penalty against him.  
 
Al-Qahtani's torture was personally 
approved by former Defense Secre-
tary Donald Rumsfeld. The torture 
techniques used against him in-
cluded beatings, severe sleep depri-
vation, forced nudity, sexual humilia-
tion, attacks by dogs, temperature 
manipulation and religious abuse. 
 
Al-Qahtani's attorney, Gitanjali 
Gutierrez of the Center for Constitu-
tional Rights, subsequently revealed 
that al-Qahtani had attempted sui-
cide after the death penalty charges 
were referred against him.  In addi-
tion, the U.S. Justice Department re-
leased a report which described 
concerns by US security officials 
about the legality and acceptability 
of al-Qahtani’s interrogations. 
 
Four Prisoners Charged in 
Military Commissions 
 
Charges of conspiracy and provid-
ing material support to terrorism 
were filed against four detainees: 
Ghassan Abdullah al-Sharbi (Saudi), 
Jabran Said bin al-Qahtani (Saudi), 
Sufyan Barhoumi (Algerian), and 
Binyan Mohamed (British resident). 
Mohamed was a victim of the so-
called “extraordinary rendition” pro-
gram:  he was previously transferred 
by U.S. forces to Morocco and tor-
tured before being returned to U.S. 
custody.   
Fourteen other detainees currently 
face military commission 
charges,while the vast majority of the 
275 men at Guantanamo have 
been held for over six years in arbi-
trary detention without charge or 
trial.  The military commissions, cre-
ated by the 2006 Military Commis-
sions Act, provide far fewer protec-
tions than otherwise provided for 
under U.S. law. 
 
Recent Military Commission 
Actions Further Challenge Le- 
gitimacy of the Military Com- 
mission Process 
 
Several actions over the last month 
have raised further concerns about 
the military commissions processes 
gearing up to try a small number of 
prisoners at Guantánamo. 
 
On May 30, 2008, the military com-
missions judge in Omar Khadr’s 
case, Col. Peter Brownback, was 
suddenly removed from his position 
presiding over Khadr’s commission. 
The judge had ordered prosecutors 
to supply a prison log of Khadr’s 
treatment to the defense. Earlier, on 
May 23, 2008, the Supreme Court 
of Canada ruled that Canadian gov-
ernment officials had violated 
Khadr's rights by interrogating him in 
Guantánamo. Khadr was arrested 
and detained as a 15-year-old juve-
nile in Afghanistan and currently 
faces military commissions charges. 
 
On May 10, 2008, Captain Keith 
Allred, another military commissions 
judge, disqualified a senior military 
guantánamo global justice initiative

ment in the military commission of 
detainee Salim Ahmad Hamdan, 
on the grounds that the official is 
too closely aligned with the prose-
cution.  A week later, the judge 
postponed the commission until 
after the Supreme Court's ex-
pected ruling in the lead 
Guantánamo detainee cases, 
which should be decided by the 
end of June 2008.   
 
In addition, on May 28, 2008, 
the military attorney for 
Mohammad Jawad, another juve-
nile when picked up by U.S. 
forces, filed a motion to dismiss 
military commissions charges 
against him on the grounds that he 
was subject to systematic sleep 
deprivation as a form of torture 
during interrogation. 
 
U.S. Announces Plans for 
Large Afghan Prison 
 
29 Afghans formerly imprisoned in 
Guantánamo or the U.S. military 
base at Bagram were released 
from Afghanistan’s Pol-i-charki 
Prison on May 1, 2008. These 
prisoners are all transferees were 
transferred to Afghan custody by 
the U.S. military.  On May 17, 
however, the U.S. military an-
nounced that it was planning to 
build a new 40-acre prison under 
U.S. control in Afghanistan at the 
Bagram base, indicating plans for 
expanded future indefinite deten-
tion in Afghanistan.  
 
Congressional Committee 
Hears Testimony of Former 
Detainee 
 
For the first time, a former Guantánamo detainee, Murat 
Kurnaz, testified before a Con-
gressional committee on May 20, 
2008.  His testimony was part of 
two hearings in which witnesses 
called for the closure of 
Guantánamo, a solution for the 
approximately 50 refugees there 
who cannot be safely repatriated 
to their home countries, and an 
improvement of the conditions in 
the prison. 
 
In addition, on May 6, a House 
Judiciary subcommittee heard testi-
mony regarding the involvement of 
government lawyers in approving 
the use of torture and circumvent-
ing international legal obligations.  
 
British former detainees 
sue UK government and 
intelligence agencies 
 
Eight former Guantánamo detain-
ees filed lawsuits against the British 
government and its security ser-
vices, on April 18, 2008, accus-
ing them of complicity with the 
Americans in their unlawful deten-
tion at Guantánamo and seeking 
damages. All were released with-
out charge after years of U.S. de-
tention in Guantánamo.  
 
Guantánamo Protestors 
Convicted in Washington, 
DC 
 
34 anti-torture activists were con-
victed in Washington, DC on 
Thursday, May 29, 2008. The 
activists were arrested during a 
protest at the Supreme Court on 
January 11, 2008, the sixth anni-
versary of the arrival of the first 
detainees at Guantánamo Bay. 
The activists are representing them-selves under the names of real 
Guantánamo detainees. Some 
refused to speak, while others pre-
sented statements seeking to bring 
the stories of Guantánamo detain-
ees inside U.S. courtrooms.  The 
activists' protest is designed to 
draw attention to the denial of 
detainees' rights and demand the 
closure of the prison at 
Guantánamo.
