In few instances is this more difficult than when our clients are seeking justice for human rights violations committed or facilitated by a powerful corporation. Starting in the 1990s, the Center began expanding the use of the Alien Tort Statute, one of our signature legal tools, to litigate these corporate cases. A long line of cases has followed since our first victory of the kind in Doe v. Unocal. Standing by our courageous clients, we have since taken on corporations like Shell, Chevron, and Caterpillar for gross human rights violations committed outside the United States, and have supported efforts to ensure corporate accountability by filing amicus briefs in U.S. courts and contributing to corporate accountability efforts at the international level. Our most recent litigation and advocacy efforts in this area have focused on the role of U.S.-based private military contractors in the unlawful killing of civilians by Blackwater in Iraq and in the torture of civilians at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.NewsSee more NewsSeptember 14, 2022At Congressional Hearing, Indigenous Water Protector Denounces Coordinated Attack on Environmental Activists by Industry, Pols, PoliceAnne White Hat details collusion and violence geared to quash movement resisting fossil fuel extraction September 14, 2022, Washington, D.C. – Today, Anne White Hat, a Sicangu Lakota Water Protector, today denounced the coordinated attack by oil and gas companies, lawmakers, and police on the...August 30, 2022UN Committee Report Presses U.S. on Slavery Reparations for First Time, Spotlights Environmental Racism in “Cancer Alley”Black community leaders from Louisiana who addressed committee earlier this month hail recommendations August 30, 2022, Geneva – For the first time, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) is calling on the U.S. government to begin the process of providing reparations to...August 15, 2022International human rights body presses U.S. on Louisiana’s 'Cancer Alley'...“When we came here, we had hope,” said St. James resident Barbara Washington, a co-director of Inclusive Louisiana. “When we look at how they heard our cries and our pleas, we are confident that we will get something done.” The groups traveled to Switzerland to call for a moratorium on...WWNOAugust 12, 2022Fifth Circuit upholds trial court’s ruling, allowing zoning lawsuit to proceed...
