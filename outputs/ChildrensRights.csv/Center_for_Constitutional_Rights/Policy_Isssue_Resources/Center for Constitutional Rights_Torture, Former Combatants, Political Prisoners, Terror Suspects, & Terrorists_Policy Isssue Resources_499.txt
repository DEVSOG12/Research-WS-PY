His recent statement adds new details about his torture to the public record.In February 2012, Khan was charged and pled guilty to various offenses before a military commission at Guantánamo. He pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement with the Convening Authority for Military Commissions. Given his longstanding cooperation, Khan will conclude his military commission sentence in February 2022, after which he will be transferred from Guantánamo Bay.Attachments  Majid_Khan_Sentencing_Statement.pdfLearn moreKhan v.
