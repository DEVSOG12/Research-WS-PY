Today, we are thrilled to share Will’s most recent TED talk, which focuses on the Federal Bureau of Prison’s Communication Management Units (CMUs). Will makes excellent use of the previously-undisclosed documents and policies CCR uncovered in Aref v. Holder, CCR’s challenge to the CMUs.  While we lost our constitutional challenge to the CMUs last year (and are currently appealing that decision), that we can share the details of how these previously secret units operate with important journalists like Will must be seen as some measure of success without victory. Please watch and share Will's new TED talk exposing the CMUs.Read moreprisonsAn activist challenges her “Terrorism” sentence for civil disobedience in the fight against the Dakota Access PipelineNovember 15, 2021News: ICC investigation into Afghanistan should include victims’ voices and U.S. crimesOctober 4, 2021The Legacy of 9/11: Reckoning with a 20-Year Ideology of War, Nativism, and AuthoritarianismSeptember 2, 2021Last modified August 31, 2021View the discussion thread.The bigger pictureCriminalizing DissentMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingSpread the wordTweetShareEmailStaff favoritesPresident Obama: What Are You Waiting for?
