To start getting at dismantling white supremacy in this moment, it is absolutely necessary to take down Donald Trump and his administration.”Check out Mic’s in-depth coverage of the march’s finale, including the short documentary they put out, both featuring Stephanie.This Friday: 14 years later, Abu Ghraib torture survivors still fighting for accountability and redress“We will have our day in court and the story of Abu Ghraib will be told by me and other men who lived – and – survived it.” –Salah Al-Ejaili, PlaintiffThis Friday marks an important hearing in the long-running effort accountability and redress for Iraqi torture survivors. Our case, Al Shimari v. CACI, was filed in 2008 on behalf of victims of torture and other war crimes at the “hard site” at Abu Ghraib against U.S.-based private contractor CACI Premier Technology, Inc. The lawsuit asserts that CACI directed and participated in a system of torture and other serious abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq where it was providing interrogation services under contract with the U.S. government.The case was filed under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), which allows non-U.S. citizens to sue for human rights violations committed abroad that “touch and concern” the United States. In June 2017, the district court judge affirmed that war crimes, torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are well-recognized and definable norms and thus fall within the court’s jurisdiction under the ATS, and ordered both parties to brief whether the record supports a finding that the plaintiffs suffered these violations. Shortly after, CACI moved to dismiss the case.This will be the first hearing in the course of the case that CCR will present in detail the torture and serious mistreatment our clients suffered at Abu Ghraib, in support of our argument that the case should move forward. If you’re in the Alexandria, VA area, please join us Friday, September 22 at 10 am.Applications now open for the 2018 Bertha Justice Fellowships at CCR!In 2012, CCR launched the Bertha Justice Fellowship to deepen our work training the next generation of “people’s lawyers.” The fellowship is a two-year program for emerging lawyers (0-2 years out of law school) who are interested in gaining both practical experience working on CCR cases and a theoretical understanding of how legal advocacy can create social change.

As she told the New York Times, her goal in making the volume “was to invite people to look at Guantánamo again after almost 16 years. Most of us have stopped looking.”    Welcome to Camp America is described as “a vivid and disorienting glimpse into the U.S. Naval Station in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and its growing diaspora, through photographs, once-classified government documents, and first-person accounts. . .The book seeks common ground while asking provocative questions about compromises made between humanity and fear in the post-9/11 era.”Learn more and purchase the book here.Read moreGuantanamo, tortureOn the Passing of Desmond Tutu: He Embodied A Fierce, Love-Based, Universalist Fight for LiberationDecember 28, 2021News: ICC investigation into Afghanistan should include victims’ voices and U.S. crimesOctober 4, 2021The Legacy of 9/11: Reckoning with a 20-Year Ideology of War, Nativism, and AuthoritarianismSeptember 2, 2021Last modified September 18, 2017View the discussion thread.The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesGuantanamoTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismSpread the wordTweetShareEmailStaff favoritesPresident Obama: What Are You Waiting for?
