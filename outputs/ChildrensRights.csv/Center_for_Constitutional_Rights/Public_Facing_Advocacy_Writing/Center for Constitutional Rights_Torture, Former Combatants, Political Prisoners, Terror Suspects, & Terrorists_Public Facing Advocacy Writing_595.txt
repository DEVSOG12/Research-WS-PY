We are disappointed but not surprised. Guled’s hearing was beset by problems and grossly unfair. He did not have adequate time to prepare for the hearing and appeared before the Board without counsel. He should not have been brought to Guantánamo 10 years ago, and his continued detention only serves as another opportunity for the Obama administration to avoid accountability for what happened in the CIA torture program.  Indeed, we know from other cases that the Board routinely relies on evidence obtained by torture, including evidence rejected by the federal courts. This process was fundamentally flawed. We look forward to filing a habeas petition to force the government to release Guled.The Center for Constitutional Rights has led the legal battle over Guantánamo for more than 14 years – representing clients in two Supreme Court cases and organizing and coordinating hundreds of pro bono lawyers across the country, ensuring that nearly all the men detained at Guantánamo have had the option of legal representation. Among other Guantánamo cases, the Center represents the families of men who died at Guantánamo, and men who have been released and are seeking justice in international courts.The Center for Constitutional Rights works with communities under threat to fight for justice and liberation through litigation, advocacy, and strategic communications. Since 1966, the Center for Constitutional Rights has taken on oppressive systems of power, including structural racism, gender oppression, economic inequity, and governmental overreach.
