“Heartland Alliance’s innovation, nimble response to change, 
and prudent planning allow us to meet the evolving needs of 
the people we serve in today’s economic challenges. ”
alan braxton, chairman of the board,  
heartland alliance for human needs & human rights
    creating an infrastructure of opportunity      1As a nation, as an economy, as a society, we are in difficult times. We now realize that we have to  
re-evaluate the path on which we have been traveling. We must address our ineffective systems and  
frayed infrastructure. It is an opportunity for solutions.
America’s infrastructure goes beyond roads and bridges. For too long, we have put aside the work of 
building the infrastructure of opportunity. A just and healthy society has pathways out of poverty.  
It has civil, social, and economic commitments that ensure that every one of us has a home.  
Everyone has health care. Everyone can be a productive worker. Everyone is treated with justice.
These are the core commitments of Heartland Alliance, and we are prepared for today’s challenges.  
We are known for being relevant, strategic, creative, and experienced in the key issues of the day.  
Heartland Alliance has the knowledge of what works and how to bring it to scale. We have the agility 
and creativity to build ideas that are programmatically effective and fiscally efficient. And we have the 
commitment to ensure that those hit hardest by a failing economy are not forgotten by new policies in 
health care, in housing, in legal protections, and in employment.
at heartland a lliance we are the architects of hope, of an infrastructure that leads the poor, the forgotten,  
and the endangered to opportunity. t his report highlights just some of our programs and successes this  
past year, all of which are creating brighter futures and stronger communities.24 percent of Illinois renter 
households spend more 
than half their income on 
housing costs, leaving 
far less left over for other essentials like food, 
clothing, and health care, 
and often placing families one crisis away from 
homelessness.With commitment and 
leadership, we can have 
affordable housing for 
communities in need.
“Heartland Alliance’s expertise in building and managing 
high-quality affordable housing will bring lasting change  
to Milwaukee.”

place to live now. She has 
a home. She’s decorated her efficiency apartment in Prairie Apartments with curtains on the windows and family photos on the walls and made friends with other residents, including one gentleman who helps her keep in touch with family members via email in the building’s computer room. “It’s nice and quiet here  and secure,” she says. “The decoration is very nice; the furniture. I just  
love it.”
Opened in February, 
Prairie Apartments is a new supportive housing development in 
Milwaukee, built from 
Heartland Alliance’s well-tested template in Chicago. Freda had been living in a homeless shelter before moving to her apartment in the spring. She had saved $1,800 from her assembly job at a local factory, but she was unable to find a place she could afford on her pay. 
The 24 units at Prairie 
Apartments house both low-income residents who have experienced homelessness and residents with mental illness who can live independently with access to some support services. Onsite staff provide counseling support and can connect residents to health care,

With a desperate need 
for better housing options, county and city officials in Milwaukee looked to Heartland Alliance’s nearly 20 years of experience in the field to build Prairie Apartments. In Chicago, services for our supportive housing developments are provided by Heartland Alliance’s other divisions; at Prairie Apartments, we’ve created a new model, with services from a local agency.
“This is a replicable pilot 
that allows Heartland Alliance to bring our expertise outside of Chicago,” says Michael Goldberg, Heartland Alliance’s director of real estate development. “We’re talking with communities in  
Indiana, Wisconsin,  
and Illinois. We can really expand our capacity to open up doors to new opportunities for people.” ■the p rairie a partments renovation

St. Leonard’s Ministries, which will open a social-enterprise coffee shop on the ground floor. ■
Heartland Alliance worked with other advocates 
to successfully secure $145 million in funding 
for affordable housing  development and 
rehabilitation in the State of Illinois’ new capital 
program. In the coming years, this funding will allow Heartland Housing and other affordable and supportive housing developers across Illinois to create new, safe homes for hundreds of families experiencing poverty. ■A new collaboration between Heartland Alliance 
and other homeless service organizations uses an 
integrated service approach to get families housed. This model connects young homeless mothers to jobs, mental health and substance use treatment, financial support, and education and their children to health care, education, and developmental and other therapy services. The average age of the mothers is 22 years old; 86 percent of the children are under five years old.

6    a year in review 200912.5 percent of Illinoisans 
live in medically

and often turn to the emergency room  
for medical care. Community health centers, like those operated by 
Heartland Alliance,  
reduce costly emergency 
room visits and save 
the health care system 
between $9.9 billion and $17.6 billion a year 
nationally.
“Research shows that when people have a medical home  
and receive regular preventive care—the kind of services 
that Heartland Health Centers provide—costs are lower  
and, most importantly, patient outcomes improve.”

8    a year in review 2009Heartland Health 
Center–Lincoln Square  
might not be what 
you would expect at a clinic designed to offer services regardless of the patients’ ability to pay. The busy waiting room is stylish, the operations are efficient and data-driven, and the mix of patients is diverse. “We’re seeing more uninsured patients who lost their jobs, people who are highly educated, people who can’t afford insurance,” says Kimberly Tester, the external relations manager at Heartland International Health Center (HIHC), which operates the site.
The Lincoln Square site 
serves the Albany Park community, where more than a third of the local population is designated by the city as “medically needy” and about 40 percent of the residents are foreign born. “I’d rate the medical attention there right up with the best at any private care I’ve received,” says Lee Zarhov, a patient at Lincoln Square. When Zarhov had triple-bypass heart surgery in 2001, his employer’s insurance paid for the operation. But he’s been a patient with HIHC since being laid off six years ago, and regularly visits the community health center for check-up appointments and  
his heart medication.  
“I don’t ever want to  
lose them,” he says of  
the care.
Heartland Alliance’s 
community health centers work because they provide a “medical home,” where patients come for regular visits, are known by their doctor, and have access to a wide array of services. With state-of-the-art electronic medical records, staff at the community health centers can reach out to remind patients about regular check-ups and monitor how well the center is serving its patients. ■

can tell you stories 
about women in Iraq. A daughter facing marriage to a man her father’s age as payment for a debt. A woman raped, abused, and forced into criminal activity by her husband. A wife who dishonored the family by being charged with adultery, threatened with death by her husband, her father, and her brother.
But more and more 
of Minwalla’s stories have happy endings. The women described above were all assisted by Heartland Alliance’s gender-based violence (GBV) prevention program in Iraq. Culturally sensitive mediation convinced the groom-to-be to call off the wedding, for example, and the program’s attorneys successfully defended the other women in court—then social workers helped the women start new lives because they could not return home due to the stigma of even being charged.
“The rates of violence 
against women are so high here and women’s lives are so restricted. There’s an extreme level of control,” says Minwalla. Even in the relatively progressive northern Kurdistan region, she says, the issues her program tackles include female genital mutilation, honor killings, and human trafficking.
Heartland Alliance has 
been working to build a mental health system in Iraq since 2003, an outgrowth of our U.S.-based mental health services and programs for refugees, including survivors of torture. Minwalla’s work with Heartland Alliance as an immigration law attorney working with victims of domestic violence in Chicago inspired her to join the gender violence program in Iraq in 2005.

Last summer, Timothy 
was back on the West 
Side of Chicago. On parole after eight and a half years in prison, he wasn’t having much luck securing a job. Today, he’s the supervisor of janitorial services at Little Black Pearl Workshop, a nonprofit that offers art programs for youth. He’s helping pay the bills in the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, and he’s back in the life of his 18-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son.
The key opportunity that 
opened up Timothy’s new life was enrolling in Heartland Alliance’s Transitional Jobs (TJ) program, which combines meaningful work experience with courses on everything from resume writing to job-search assistance. “Everybody in my class was on parole, and everybody wanted to change their life around,” he says.
Timothy spent eight 
weeks last fall in a transitional job at Little Black Pearl, and they were so impressed that they hired him full-time. Most of the other dozen TJ participants that have worked at the nonprofit have found jobs elsewhere after working on the team. When they graduate from TJ, participants have shown themselves and the world that they can be a dependable and valuable employee, they have new experience and another reference on their resume.
The ex-offender program 
is one of eight Transitional Jobs programs run by Heartland Alliance, each serving a population that isn’t easily served by traditional workforce programs, such as adults with very low literacy skills. More than 500 individuals enrolled in a Heartland Alliance TJ program in 2008, twice as many as just two years ago. Heartland Alliance also staffs and leads the National Transitional Jobs Network, a coalition of 4,000 providers around the country that pushed for dedicated funding for TJ in President Barack Obama’s budget earlier this year. ■
