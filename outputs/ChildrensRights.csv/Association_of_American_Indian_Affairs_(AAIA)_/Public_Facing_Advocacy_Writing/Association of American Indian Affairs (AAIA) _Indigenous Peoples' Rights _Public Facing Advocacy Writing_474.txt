Dear Attorney General Lynch,  
 
 The Association on American Indian Affairs (AAIA) condemns the 
actions of Morton Count y law enforcement on November 20 , 2016, against the 
Water Protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline. Excess ive force was 
used against protesters, including rubber bullets, mace/pepper spray, water 
cannons in subfreezing temperatures, and tear gas. Law enforcement officers 
were dressed in riot gear, met peaceful Water Protectors with military style 
vehicles, and  violated the First Amendment and other constitutional rights 
afforded to each person assembled there to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
The horror of these actions played out in living rooms across our country as 
fellow Americans witnessed the violent chaos on their televisions. These 
unarmed Water Protectors have sustained injuries including hypothermia 
from water cannons, blinded and  blackened eyes and swollen extremities from 
rubber bullets, and a woman who suffered severe injuries to her arm from a 
concussion grenade and is undergoing multiple surgeries to prevent 
amputation.  
 
 These actions by law enforcement were inhumane and warrant an 
immediate investigation by the Department of Justice.  The AAIA stands with 
the Water Protectors, traditional an d spiritual leaders, and the Standing Rock 
Sioux Tribe in opposition to this excessive brutality against native people and 
their supporters.  We urge you to exercise your powers as the Attorney General 
of the United States to investigate these outrageous v iolent acts and tactics 
taken by local law enforcement and their blatant attempts to suppress the 
Water Protectorsâ€™ First Amendment and other constitutional rights.  
 
 Winter is quickly closing in and AAIA urges that construction be 
halted, all federal per mits be suspended, and that federal and tribal officials 
engage in meaningful consultations pursuant to Executive Order 13175  and 
federal law to ensure that a full environmental and cultural review takes place.     
 
 On behalf of the oldest Indian advocacy  member organization in the 
United States established in 1922, we reiterate that you personally intervene to 
prevent further excessive and unnecessary force being carried out by local law
