Many of these sacred places are located on what is now public land and Western concepts of resource development, such as logging, mining and tourism, may conflict with the integrity of these sacred places. Yet, while federal and other land managers routinely take into account the needs of developers and recreational users in making land management decisions, they do not so readily take into account the often profound effect of their undertakings upon sacred, ceremonial and traditional cultural places that are critical to Native American populations, tribes and cultures.​The Association has provided assistance to tribes and traditional practitioners to protect sacred places for decades. For example:For more than 20 years, the Association provided legal assistance to and engaged in advocacy efforts in support of tribes seeking to protect the sacred Medicine Wheel/Medicine Mountain in Wyoming. The ultimate result of these efforts was the approval of the area as a National Historic Landmark because of its traditional cultural value and the development of an Historic Preservation Plan to protect the site.The Association has provided support for the efforts of many other Tribes across the country to help them fight development that would have had an adverse impact upon their sacred places. These places have included San Francisco Peaks (Arizona), Devils Tower [Bear Lodge] (Wyoming), Bear Butte (South Dakota), Medicine Lake (California), Rainbow Bridge (Utah), Cave Rock (California), Indian Pass (California), Petroglyph National Monument (New Mexico), Black Creek (New Jersey), Mount Graham (Arizona), Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [ANWR] (Alaska), and Otter Creek (Montana).​The Association provides technical assistance and training to Tribal advocates, attorneys and federal land managers, including workshops about how they can use the law to protect sacred places and a handbook summarizing those laws.​Useful LinksAbout the AssociationScholarshipsProgramsJob ListingsCon﻿tactPrivacy Policy​​Please note our mailing address change:Association on American Indian Affairs6030 Daybreak CircleSuite A150-217Clarksville, MD 21029General Information​The Association is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3)publicly supported organization.​We do not take federal grants.The Association is governed by an all-NativeBoard of Directors and leadership team. The Association is an accredited charity and meets all 20 standards of the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.The Association has achieved the highest rating - PLATINUM - from GuideStar, now known as Candid​100 Years of AdvocacyThe Association is celebrating its 100th year of service in Indian Country.
