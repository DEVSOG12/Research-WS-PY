We call for the immediate opening of tribal consultations and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to review the impacts on both cultural resources and the environment on the entire Dakota Access Pipeline.On January 24, 2017, President Trump took action to move forward with the Dakota Access and Keystone Pipelines.  Read more about his Executive Order here.  While his orders do not force the approval of either pipeline, they do open the door negotiations with an eye toward getting them built. On February 21, 2017, The Association on American Indian Affairs (AAIA), University of New Mexico School of Law Environmental Law Clinic, and the Pueblo of Pojoaque, have joined in an amici brief in the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes’ motion of partial summary judgment to provide important insight to the court on the trust responsibility that the United States has to Indian tribes to protect tribal interests through tribal consultations and federal laws, such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA)Previously, on December 4, 2016, after several months of efforts on the part of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, American Indian tribes throughout the country, and the Water Protectors, the Army Corps of Engineers had denied the permit  that the Dakota Access Pipeline requested to cross Lake Oahe. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was scheduled to include environmental and cultural resources reviews with meaningful tribal consultations and considerations for alternatives for that segment of the pipeline. AAIA supports the decision to open the EIS and conduct these important environmental and cultural resources reviews in consultation with American Indian tribes and urges the new Administration to include American Indian tribes in any negotiations held with pipeline sponsors.In addition, the AAIA opposes the excessive force used by law enforcement against Water Protectors, peacefully assembled to protest the advancement of the Dakota Access Pipeline, on November 20-21, 2016. Law enforcement used water cannons in subfreezing temperatures, rubber bullets, tear gas, and concussion grenades that left many people suffering from hypothermia and at least two people suffering from horrific injuries. In response, the AAIA Board of Directors has sent a letter to the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these terrible acts against Water Protectors and any violations against their Constitutional rights.Take Action Now!The AAIA encourages you to take action now to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline.
