Events this weekend in Columbus, Cincinnati and Portsmouth will feature noted Evangelical Christian author Shane Claiborne, whose book ‘Executing Grace: How the death penalty killed Jesus and why it’s killing us,’ has become a core source on the issue for millennial Christians.“Christians who support the death penalty not only have the nagging problem of Jesus, but they are sharply at odds with the first 300 years of Christianity,” said Claiborne, one of the founders of the Red Letter Christians network, which advocates living as if Jesus really meant what he said. Claiborne is sharing his experience in conjunction with Ohioans to Stop Executions, Faith in Public Life, the Ohio Council of Churches and others in an effort to help gather Christians who are ready to put their faith into action to help prevent executions from resuming in Ohio.“A 2014 poll showed nearly 80% of millennial Christians oppose the death penalty, and only 5% of Americans believe Jesus would be in favor of executions,” said Amanda Hoyt, Ohio director of Faith In Public Life, a group which lifts up the voices of religious leaders working for economic and social justice. “Our goal in collaborating with Ohioans to Stop Executions is to help policy makers understand that Ohioans of faith believe that we can hold dangerous criminals accountable and keep the public safe without the death penalty.”Shane Claiborne is available for advance interviews.
