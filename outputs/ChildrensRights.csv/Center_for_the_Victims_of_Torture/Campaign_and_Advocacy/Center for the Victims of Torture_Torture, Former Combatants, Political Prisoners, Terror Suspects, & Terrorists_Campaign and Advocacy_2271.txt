During captivity, she was forced to watch as they were beaten and murdered. Sabeen fled to Amman, Jordan. She suffered from headaches, chronic pain, depression, anxiety and nightmares. After being referred to CVT Jordan, Sabeen became more self-confident and reported fewer nightmares and headaches.CVT’s work in Jordan is made possible with funding from the US State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and the United States Agency for International Development/World Learning and the American people’s support, and Open Society FoundationPhoto: Patrick Nicholson/CaritasThe names of survivors and some personal details have been changed to protect their identity.
