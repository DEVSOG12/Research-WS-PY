I had problems but it was hard to know what to do or where to go. I had many challenges from my homeland of Burundi in my mind. Before CVT I felt very bad. I met people who came to CVT who told me about the service.I had so many problems – I joined CVT.Before CVT I was not able to control my problems; I felt my body was weak. Now I know what to do. If I have a problem, now I do exercises – it helps. Sometimes if I just do it, it helps.I had to start all over again. I did both physiotherapy and counseling. I started to feel happy in my heart. As an example, before CVT, my body was not awake. I was not feeling well because of my past experiences in my life. Now if I find my body is not comfortable, I decide to go to the hospital.When I joined CVT, I felt I was in my family. The problem I had was made smaller. With CVT, everything becomes more free.My life today is somehow better. I’m in a comfortable place. I’m relieved. Something changes – whatever the counseling does – it changes you. CVT, they gave me happiness.CVT changes people who have difficult challenges. They give people the chance to address the problems they had. For me, I addressed how I was feeling when I came here.CVT develops the person – it changed me from the first stage to the second stage. Now I wan t to tell others so you can provide this service to people. When I meet people with problems in the community, I uplift them and then I just give some advice to join CVT in order to change their problems.Briefly let me say: Don’t leave us.*Name has been changed for security and confidentiality.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
