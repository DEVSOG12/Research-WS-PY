The goal was to join CVT’s voice with the voices of national religious leaders and those of the nation’s military, national security and foreign policy leaders.The Campaign to Ban Torture created the Declaration of Principles for a Presidential Executive Order on Prisoner Treatment, Torture and Cruelty (PDF).Over 200 prominent religious leaders and military, national security and foreign policy experts endorsed the Declaration of Principles. Among them were three former Secretaries of Defense, three former National Security Advisors, three former Secretaries of Defense, and four former members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Campaign was instrumental in encouraging President Obama to sign an executive order on torture and interrogation policy on January 22, 2009.FilesCTBT_Declaration_of_Principles.pdf CTBT_Endorsers.pdfMain menuWho We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsCampaign to Ban TortureHealing in PartnershipGuineaThe Democratic Republic of CongoInternational Capacity Building ProjectLiberiaMinnesota Training ProjectsSierra LeoneTrauma Healing Initiative AfricaTrauma Healing Initiative - CambodiaWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowRead Ocen James's StoryRead Ocen James's StoryRead Other Survivor StoriesSubscribeSign up for updates and alertsEmail:ZIP/Postal Code:Spam Control Text:Connect with usHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
