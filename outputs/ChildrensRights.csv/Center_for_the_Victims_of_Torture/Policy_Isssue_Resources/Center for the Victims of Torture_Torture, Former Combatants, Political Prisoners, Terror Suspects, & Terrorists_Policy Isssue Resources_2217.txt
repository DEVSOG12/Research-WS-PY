To do this, CVT's Policy team uses multiple strategies to shine a light on the experiences of asylum seekers and refugees before Congress and before the public.A staggering number of refugees and asylum seekers are torture survivors. While our clinicians work to heal their wounds, our policy team advocates for just and humane systems through which refugees and asylum seekers—and the survivors among them—can seek protection in the United States, consistent with their fundamental human rights and the United States’ legal obligations. The policy team’s public education and advocacy emphasize the real-life experiences of CVT’s clients.CVT AT THE BORDER - Video PlaylistUpdate from TijuanaAndrea Cárcamo, senior policy counsel, visited the U.S. Southern border with colleagues, assessing ways to alleviate suffering among those seeking refuge from torture and persecution. In this video, she describes the difficult conditions experienced by refugees and asylum seekers who have been affected by the “Remain in Mexico” policy.In May 2019, Andrea Cárcamo spent a week in El Paso meeting with asylum seekers in El Paso detention facilities. Read her article here and check out her daily video logs in the playlist.EIGHT FACTS ABOUT REFUGEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERSOver more than three decades, CVT has witnessed extraordinary healing, courage and resilience among clients, while at the same time we have seen confusion and misunderstanding from many in the public about the lives and challenges faced by refugees and asylum seekers. To help clarify misconceptions and shed light on the realities of the lives of torture survivors, CVT has published eight facts that we hope will help dispel some of the myths about who refugees and asylum seekers really are. Read all Eight Facts about Refugees and Asylum Seekers here.Partnerships: Check out this summary of CVT's asylum advocacy partners.CVT Statements, Media Clips, Letters & PublicationsLetter to the Biden Administration: Strengthen the CAM ProgramSept. 21, 2022CVT joined 100+ organizations in this letter urging President Biden and his administration to reform and strengthen the Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee & Parole Program for families in need of reunification in the United States. The authors write, “Since the expansion of the CAM Program one year ago, out of all the newly eligible families only a few hundred have been able to apply. And as far as we are aware, not one has reunited through the CAM Program this year.”Letter to DHS: End Mistreatment of Religious MigrantsAug. 22, 2022CVT joined more than 160 organizations in this letter calling on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to end mistreatment of religious migrants and asylum seekers by U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP). The authors write, “For years, advocates and the media have repeatedly raised concerns about the seizure of religious headwear and other articles of faith, as well as the denial of religious diets by CBP,” noting that these abuses have been allowed so long they seem to be standard practice.Letter to Congress: Do Not Allow Codification of Title 42July 15, 2022CVT signed onto this letter to congressional leaders, with concerns about amendments to a spending bill that would codify use of Title 42, a policy used under the Trump administration to keep asylum seekers out of the U.S. under the guise of public health. The authors write, “Keeping Title 42 in place puts refugees at risk, exacerbates chaos at the border, and serves no legitimate public health goals.”Letter to USCIS: Support Stateless People in the U.S.July 14, 2022CVT joined human rights organizations in this letter to Ur Jaddou, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, reminding him of promises made, but not yet kept, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

CVT has been fighting against this cruel, Trump-era policy for a very long time. “It is long past time that the Remain in Mexico policy ends and asylum seekers are no longer forced to wait in Mexico, sometimes for years, while their asylum processes move ahead at an often-glacial pace,” said Scott Roehm, CVT Washington director.CVT Statement: Title 42 Court RulingMay 23, 2022CVT issued this statement in response to the court ruling on Title 42, which will keep the ban on asylum seekers in place at the U.S. Southern border under the false pretense of public health. “For every day the Title 42 ban is continued, more and more lives are put at risk,” writes Jessica Douglas, external relations officer, CVT Georgia. “The U.S. must act now to restore a just and humane asylum system which reflects our values.”Apr. 26, 2022Letter to Elected Representatives: End Use of Title 42CVT joined 205 civil and human rights organizations in this letter urging elected representatives to support ending the use of Title 42, a public health law that was used by the Trump administration as an excuse to keep asylum seekers out of the U.S. The letter was organized by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the authors write, “The misuse of Title 42 is one of the most urgent civil and human rights issues of our day, and we urge you to stand with immigrants and welcome all with dignity.”Apr. 25, 2022Letter to Department of Homeland Security: Responsible Public Charge RegulationsCVT joined 1,070 nonprofits in this letter urging the Department of Homeland Security to quickly finalize responsible public charge regulations to protect families. The authors write, “Safety net programs for health, nutrition, housing, and other basic needs help nearly half of Americans to make ends meet at some point in their lifetime. In an economy where, for millions, working full-time isn’t enough to pay the rent, take the children to the doctor, or put food on the table, getting help doesn’t make a person – citizen or not – a public charge. It makes them part of a typical family.”Apr. 21, 2022Letter to President Biden: End the Use of Title 42Dr. Simon Adams, CVT president and CEO, joined leaders of humanitarian and human rights organizations in this letter to President Biden, requesting termination of use of Title 42, a public health law that was used by the Trump administration as an excuse to keep asylum seekers out of the U.S. The authors write, “Four decades ago, Congress unanimously committed to welcome those seeking refuge. The previous administration did its best to unravel that commitment; we implore you to ensure that this Administration and Congress do not finish the job for them.”Apr. 7, 2022Letter to President Biden: Continuing Harms of the Muslim BanCVT joined more than 70 organizations in this letter to President Biden, reminding him that discriminatory effects of the Trump administration’s Muslim Ban continue to harm refugees in the U.S. The authors urge action, writing “With the increase in humanitarian needs from the crises in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and elsewhere, now is the time to ensure that the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is operating fairly, efficiently, and securely.”Letter to President Biden: Expulsions of Venezuelan Asylum Seekers to ColombiaFeb. 2, 2022CVT joined more than 100 organizations in this letter urging President Biden to end use of Title 42 to expel asylum seekers from Venezuela, and the torture survivors among them.Rulemaking Comments: End Family SeparationJan. 25, 2022CVT submitted rulemaking comments to the Department of Homeland Security, detailing ways to minimize the separation of migrant parents and legal guardians and children entering the United States. Beyond previous policies that were used intentionally to separate families, Andrea Carcamo, senior policy counsel, notes that these recommendations span many “U.S. immigration policies and practices beyond the border—some that have been in place for decades—[that] also lead to the rupture of the parent-child bond. Those, too, must be addressed to ensure the U.S. treats asylum seekers and other migrants with dignity.”Letter to the White House: End MPP & Title 42 PoliciesDec. 17, 2021CVT joined more than 240 organizations this letter opposing the Biden administration’s restarted and expanded use of the Remain in Mexico policy and continued use of the Title 42 policy, both of which cause harm to asylum seekers at the U.S. Southern border. The letter was covered here in Reuters.Letter to DHS Secretary Mayorkas and USCIS Director Jaddou: Rescind EADs RulesNov. 17, 2021CVT joined this letter to DHS Secretary Mayorkas and USCIS Director Jaddou, urging the Biden administration to rescind Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) rules that were put in place under the previous administration and which keep asylum seekers from working while their asylum cases are underway.Letter to Sec.
