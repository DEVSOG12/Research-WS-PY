Are our treatment and rehabilitative services as robust and effective as they could be? And how does our sense of compassion vary depending on the way a person copes?In this episode, we’ll explore policies that make coping and healing easier and effective, specifically harm reduction-based approaches such as safe consumption sites and medication-assisted therapy (MAT).About the Web SeriesHosted by Sasha Simon, Safety First Senior Program Manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, First of All aims to clear away all the junk science and stigma related to substance use, putting science, dignity and respect first. In this series, Simon brings key components of a harm reduction-approach to drug education to life online so viewers can discover innovative ways to learn about drugs that could save their lives or those of the people they love.Watch more First of All episodes.Criminal Justice ReformDrug TreatmentHarm ReductionMass CriminalizationVideomade of millionsFeatured ResourcesEnd No-Knock Warrants and Militarized Quick-Knock RaidsDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemMember NewsletterMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release10.13.22Civil Rights Groups, Policy Experts Welcome Sen.
