This twisted drug war logic ignores the fact that denying housing or kicking people out of their homes only creates new problems and makes existing ones worse. People and families without homes are less likely to be able to keep jobs or stay in school, and those without homes who are using drugs are more likely to overdose or use more chaotically. Instead of shutting people out, we should be opening doors so that everyone has a place to call home.This webinar brings together advocates, researchers, and directly impacted people to explore the ways in which the drug war has infiltrated the housing system and to generate solutions for reform. It is the fourth in a series of six webinars about DPA’s new initiative, Uprooting the Drug War.Moderator:Tara Raghuveer, KC Tenants and People's ActionSpeakers:Hill Brown, The Steady CollectiveSusan Burton, A New Way of LifeRyan McNeil, Yale School of MedicineQueen Mendez, POWER/Ground GameJames "Qadhafi" Shelby, KC Homeless Union and KC TenantsWatch more of this discussion series.Criminal Justice ReformDrug DecriminalizationHarm ReductionVideoUprooting the Drug WarFeatured ResourcesEnd No-Knock Warrants and Militarized Quick-Knock RaidsDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemMember NewsletterMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release10.13.22Civil Rights Groups, Policy Experts Welcome Sen.
