The history of police militarization is inextricably linked to federal drug policy, and much of the funding for police militarization has come from programs created, in part, to enforce drug prohibition.To address police killings and violence, we must end the war on drugs and prevent law enforcement and policymakers from using drug use and sales as a pretext for equipping and training police-like armies.View the fact sheet.Criminal Justice ReformFact SheetFeatured ResourcesDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemUprooting the Drug WarUprooting the Drug War Discussion Series: Housing, the Drug War, and the Denial of Stable Places to LiveMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release09.26.22Governor Newsom Signs Groundbreaking Legislation to Protect California Residents from the Lifelong Consequences of a Drug ConvictionPress Release06.08.22Joint DPA, Vera & WFP Statement on Recall of San Francisco DA Chesa BoudinPress Release12.02.21Congress Should Reject Biden’s Harmful Scheduling Proposal and Focus on Public Health Solutions to the Overdose CrisisMore NewsTake ActionHistoric Drug Decriminalization Bill in CongressThe Drug Policy Reform Act is an unprecedented bill that would decriminalize drugs at the federal level. It will be introduced soon: tell your members of Congress support it.Take action.Get UpdatesSign up to receive action alerts and news about drug policy reform.Press Resources.Get tips for covering the war on drugs and download DPA staff photos, logos, marijuana stock photos and b-roll video.See ResourcesStrategic PlanOur new strategic plan takes bold steps to dismantle this war on drugs and our communities.
