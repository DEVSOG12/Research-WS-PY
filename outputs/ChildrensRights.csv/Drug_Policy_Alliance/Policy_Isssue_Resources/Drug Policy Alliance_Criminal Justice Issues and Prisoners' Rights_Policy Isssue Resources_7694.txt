Prop. 47 changed certain low-level crimes like drug possession and petty-theft offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. While Prop 47 received 60% of the vote statewide and passed in Los Angeles County with 65%, as of July 2015, there have been only 34,762 Prop 47 filings submitted to the Los Angeles Superior Court. This represents just 12% of the 300,000 potentially eligible cases in the County. This is concerning because the retroactive component of the law expires on November 4th, 2017; which impacts a substantial portion of the individuals seeking Prop 47 relief.The data below represents the progress that LA County has made in implementing Prop 47 and was provided by the Los Angeles County Probation Department and the Los Angeles Superior Court.For statewide information on Prop 47 go to Myprop47.org.LA_County_Prop_47_Progress_Report.pdfCriminal Justice ReformFact SheetCaliforniaFeatured ResourcesDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemUprooting the Drug WarUprooting the Drug War Discussion Series: Housing, the Drug War, and the Denial of Stable Places to LiveMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release10.13.22Civil Rights Groups, Policy Experts Welcome Sen.
