Ten years later, veteran drug law reform activists Anthony Papa and Terrence Stevens join “Drugs and Stuff” to reflect on the destruction the draconian Rockefeller Drug Laws wreaked on so many New Yorkers and share their thoughts on the reforms.Anthony Papa, manager of media relations for the Drug Policy Alliance, was handed a mandatory minimum fifteen years to life for a first-time nonviolent drug law offense. While incarcerated, Anthony became a highly renowned artist. He became the first person in New York to receive clemency and a pardon.Terrence Stevens, a disabled drug law reform activist, is the founder and CEO of a Harlem-based nonprofit organization that assists children affected by parental incarceration and impacted by the criminal justice system. Terrence was paralyzed from the neck down with Muscular Dystrophy when he was cruelly sentenced to fifteen years to life on a first-time low-level, nonviolent drug offense. He was granted clemency in 2001 after serving 10 years.Read Anthony Papa's op-ed in NY Daily News about the historic Rockefeller reforms.Listen to more podcastsCriminal Justice ReformAudiopodcastFeatured ResourcesDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemUprooting the Drug WarUprooting the Drug War Discussion Series: Housing, the Drug War, and the Denial of Stable Places to LiveMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release09.26.22Governor Newsom Signs Groundbreaking Legislation to Protect California Residents from the Lifelong Consequences of a Drug ConvictionPress Release06.08.22Joint DPA, Vera & WFP Statement on Recall of San Francisco DA Chesa BoudinPress Release12.02.21Congress Should Reject Biden’s Harmful Scheduling Proposal and Focus on Public Health Solutions to the Overdose CrisisMore NewsTake ActionHistoric Drug Decriminalization Bill in CongressThe Drug Policy Reform Act is an unprecedented bill that would decriminalize drugs at the federal level. It will be introduced soon: tell your members of Congress support it.Take action.Get UpdatesSign up to receive action alerts and news about drug policy reform.Press Resources.Get tips for covering the war on drugs and download DPA staff photos, logos, marijuana stock photos and b-roll video.See ResourcesStrategic PlanOur new strategic plan takes bold steps to dismantle this war on drugs and our communities.
