They often receive longer sentences, fewer opportunities for education and growth, and are at an increased risk for physical and sexual violence. The vast majority of these children have experienced high levels of early childhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences which is why they ended up in the justice system to begin with. The practice of ignoring child status in the criminal justice system, results in children being condemned to a life of continued abuse, hardship, poor health, lengthy incarceration and even early death. At Human Rights for Kids, we believe there is no such thing as a “throw away” child and we work relentlessly to ensure that every child who comes into conflict with the law is treated in a trauma-informed and age-appropriate manner to promote their growth and re-entry into society so that they may reach their full potential and lead long, healthy and productive lives.Policy IssuesOur ApproachReal change requires an ever-expanding coalition. We’ve developed a unique, proven approach we call “Ripples of Hope” that engages policymakers, advocates and system stakeholders to increase protections for vulnerable children across the United States. Through this strategy, we achieve policy reforms in various regions of the country, creating momentum that then translates to wide-scale, systemic change.
