When we fail to protect our children from harm or effectively treat children who have suffered harm, we condemn them to a life of continued abuse, hardship, poor health, incarceration, and early death.Children with at least 2 ACEs are 4 to 12 times more likely to suffer from alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide attemptsChildren with at least 5 ACEs are 8.3 times more likely to experience sexual violence as an adultApproximately 90% of children in the juvenile justice system have at least 2 ACEsApproximately 27% of boys and 45% of girls in the juvenile justice system have at least 5 ACEsFor more information or to share with others, please view our ACEs Facts Sheet.ACEs and Human RightsBy addressing ACEs with an inter-sectional human rights lens, Human Rights for Kids reduces negative life outcomes for children. Human Rights for Kids works on a systems level to disrupt the occurrence and impact of ACEs.Every system that impacts our children must be examined, held accountable and improved.
