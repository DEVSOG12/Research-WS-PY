Therefore, we advocate for states to eliminate the application of the felony-murder rule to children in order to create more fair and age-appropriate sentences.See what reforms are pending in your state below:TwitterFacebookYoutubeInstagramHuman Rights for Kids is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights for children.
