We’re a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights for children. We use an integrated, multi-faceted approach which consists of research and public education, coalition building and grassroots mobilization, and policy advocacy and strategic litigation to advance critical human rights on behalf of children in the United States and around the world.Our work consists of:Protecting children from harmReforming justice systems to ensure we focus on rehabilitating children who come into conflict with the lawProtecting immigrant, non-native children from harm and discriminationPromoting access to quality education for all childrenPromoting healthy communities for children to ensure access to housing and health careWe also work to ensure that every nation state has signed, ratified and is in compliance with the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child and other applicable international treaties that promote and protect the human rights of children.Our LogoThe Human Rights for Kids logo summarizes our mission in a visual way. Shaped like a star, the logo stands for guidance, light, positivity, and hope. A section of the star is brought to the forefront to represent a child reaching out to welcome and be welcomed. You’ll notice the child’s head also doubles as the sun. The golden color palette represents brightness, as the gradient treatment represents the journey from darkness to light, from despair to hope. Overall, our logo is a beacon of hope and progress, and a constant reminder of our purpose.Our VisionWe envision a world where society protects children from violence and harm, provides treatment and care to those children who do suffer harm, rehabilitates and forgives children who make mistakes or harm others, and ensures that all children are healthy and have equal opportunity in the race of life so that they may pursue their dreams and reach their full potential.Our ValuesLoveWe love our children, one another, and ourselves, including those who may disagree with us.HumilityWe are humble which is most accurately reflected in how we treat and value others.HopeWe hope for a better future for our children, one another, and ourselves.LeadershipWe are all leaders; we credit others when we achieve success and shoulder the blame when things go wrong, as they sometimes will.Moral CourageWe believe that moral courage is the one essential, vital quality needed to create a better future for our children in a world that yields most painfully to change.DiversityWe value the diversity of children that make up the world and the diversity of one another which makes us stronger, more beautiful people.EmpowermentWe believe in empowering those who have been directly impacted by human rights abuses as children to create change, and empowering one another to be our best selves.DeterminationWe believe that through our determined efforts there is nothing we can’t accomplish.IntegrityWe believe in living out our values in every aspect of our work in good times and in bad times.GenuinenessWe believe we are at our best when we are our authentic selves; there is only one of us and we were born to shine.HonestyWe believe in being honest with others, one another, and ourselves no matter how difficult it may be because honesty is the foundation of love.SelflessnessWe believe in the importance of sacrificing for our children and for one another which is the touchstone of love.InclusivityWe value inclusivity and believe that people of all backgrounds have an important role to play in creating a better future for our children.ConfidenceWe are amazing, gifted, and incredible advocates who are a force for good individually and together.Our ApproachOur PeopleOur ImpactTwitterFacebookYoutubeInstagramHuman Rights for Kids is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights for children.
