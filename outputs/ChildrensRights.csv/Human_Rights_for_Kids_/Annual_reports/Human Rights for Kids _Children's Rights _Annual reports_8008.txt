Our advocacy efforts helped lead to the passage of three new paradigm shifting laws in Virginia, the introduction of more than a dozen state bills, and two new bills in the U.S. Congress. We helped win a case in the Washington State Supreme Court which retroactively ended mandatory minimum/presumptive sentences for children prosecuted as adults. And we were once again back at the U.S. Supreme Court arguing on behalf of children who were convicted by an unconstitutional and racist Jim Crow-era law in Louisiana.DownloadGo backTwitterFacebookYoutubeInstagramHuman Rights for Kids is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights for children.
