So says a much-publicized report that came out earlier this year, after two years of research and analysis. That report was produced by the Task Force on Detainee Treatment, a bipartisan panel of independent experts, sponsored by the Constitution Project. It provides a comprehensive portrayal of U.S.-sponsored torture of post-9/ 11 detainees, but it doesn’t tell the full story.At the same time members of the task force were conducting interviews with high-level Bush administration officials and reviewing public documents, the Senate Intelligence Committee was conducting its own investigation. Its extensive, 6,000-page report is critical in understanding the full story of torturous interrogation methods because it was based in part on information contained in classified documents that task force members were not privy to, but it remains classified.The public deserves to know the truth. The committee is expected to vote on whether to release the report this fall. Without the full truth, accessible to all, how can we expect to never go back to such a terrible time, such a shameful era?Torture is illegal without exception. In 1944, the United States signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which binds our country to the following stipulation: “No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability, or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.”Torture runs contrary to all religions and dishonors all faiths. It is an egregious violation of the dignity and worth of every human being — both that of the torturer and the tortured. As a clergyman, I follow a faith that teaches me the importance of treating all people decently. Our government should follow that precept as well.I join people of faith from hundreds of diverse religious and faith-based groups who have come together through the National Religious Campaign Against Torture to call on the Senate Intelligence Committee to publicly release its torture report.The Rev. Dr. James A. Siefkes is a retired executive of the former American Lutheran Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. He started the Congressional Social Concerns Program in the ALC and directed the Mission Discovery Program in the ELCA. He lives in Minneapolis.More From Star Tribune16-year-old in stolen car leads officers on 28-mile chaseTrump endorses Scott Jensen, Kim Crockett in Minnesota racesMore From Star Tribune16-year-old in stolen car leads officers on 28-mile chaseTrump endorses Scott Jensen, Kim Crockett in Minnesota racesMore From OpinionOpinionOctober 26Editorial cartoon: Nick Anderson on KanyeHarald EriksenOctober 26Schools fail because we sabotage kidsWith technology and curriculum experiments.Joshua PedersonOctober 26Relax: Shakespeare and Socrates are fineAlleged abandonment of classics is much ado about nothing.Dave BergerOctober 26Give us compromise on Henry High name changeThere are many great options for the Minneapolis school, but please consider keeping our team nickname.LettersOctober 26Readers Write: U Regent Sviggum's comments, election claimsFull dialogue was cut shortTop StoriesBrian O'Hara step closer to being next Mpls. police chiefOct. 26Fourth defendant in Feeding Our Future case pleads guiltyOct. 2616-year-old in stolen car leads officers on 28-mile chaseOct. 26Most ReadSchools fail because we sabotage kids• Opinion ExchangeTell us again: Who's in charge of Minneapolis police?• Opinion ExchangeAre Republicans necessary?• Opinion ExchangeGive us compromise on Henry High name change• Opinion ExchangeWhy schools fail: a view from a college professor• Opinion ExchangeStarTribuneFollow Us On:FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramSubscribe todayCompanyAbout the Star TribuneContact usWork For UsNews in EducationMinnesota's BestHigh school sports hubsMobile and tablet appsPolicies and StandardsAdvertise with usTalk with a business consultantMedia kitClassifiedsBuyStar Tribune StorePhoto ReprintsFull Page Archive: 150+ yearsBack CopiesCommercial reprintsLicensingCustomer supportHelp and FeedbackManage your accountNewspaper subscriptionDigital accesseEditionVacation hold/billingWebsiteTerms of usePrivacy policySite indexRSS© 2022 StarTribune.
