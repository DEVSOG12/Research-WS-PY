Richard Killmer, emphasized the moral imperative of establishing such a commission at this time.“We must, as a nation, address the fact that high-ranking officials in our government authorized torture and that agents representing our country carried out acts of torture in our name,” Gustitus said.  "A Commission of Inquiry is critical to develop the complete picture of what the United States did, how many people were involved and affected, and how such a heinous policy was approved.  Without that record, we have no guarantee we can prevent it from happening in the future."Killmer added, "We need to know how we reached a point at which Justice Department lawyers and top White House officials, including the President and Vice President, thought a few words written in a memo could overturn not only international treaties and domestic laws, but also more than 200 years of steadfast moral opposition to torture in this country."“The only question now," Killmer concluded, "is whether we can learn from these horrific acts, condemn them resoundingly as a nation, and enact policies and procedures so that our children and grandchildren grow up in a world where we can truly say, ‘America does not torture.’”For more information about NRCAT’s call for a Commission of InquiryClick “Call for a Commission of Inquiry” at www.tortureisamoralissue.org# # #The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a growing membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
