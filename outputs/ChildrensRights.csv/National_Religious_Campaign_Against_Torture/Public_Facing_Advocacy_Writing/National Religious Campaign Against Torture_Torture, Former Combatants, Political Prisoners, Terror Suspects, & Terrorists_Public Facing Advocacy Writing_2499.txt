Rev. Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture thanked Congress for this step and issued the following statement on the war:"Our government's support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen directly implicates the U.S. in torture, killings of civilians, bombings of hospitals and school buses, and obliteration of the infrastructure necessary to feed and protect Yemen's 28 million people."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities.
