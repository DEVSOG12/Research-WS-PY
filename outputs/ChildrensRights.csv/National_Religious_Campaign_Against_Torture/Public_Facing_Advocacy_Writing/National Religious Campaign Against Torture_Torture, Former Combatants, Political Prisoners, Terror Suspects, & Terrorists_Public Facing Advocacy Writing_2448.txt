Letter: Release the report on tortureNews Sports Entertainment Opinion Best of the Best USA TODAY Obituaries eNewspaper Legals Subscribe LETTERSLetter: Release the report on tortureStaff WriterTopeka Capital-JournalView CommentsView CommentsMany would as soon forget or deny that the United States tortured in the aftermath of 9/11, but the Constitution Project’s bipartisan Task Force on Detainee Treatment has found “that it is indisputable that the United States used torture and cruel inhuman treatment of detainees.”The painful memories of 9/11 have not been forgotten, nor should they be.However, the use of torture has for the most part been pushed into a hidden corner of our national memory. As long as we deny or forget its use, our democracy will be wounded. For healing to happen and our government to be held accountable, this painful memory must be brought to light.The Senate Intelligence Committee has produced a report of its own — 6,000 pages long and based on classified information — yet to be made public. The report is essential to understanding the realities of the torture our government committed in our name, and what must be done to ensure that torture is never used again.We must have a national discourse among the citizenry and within the halls of power on the past use of torture.The decisions of a democratic government affect every citizen. Moving on from an era of torture without a complete understanding of the horrors undertaken is a dangerous misstep for a country that prides itself on following the moral high ground and setting a model for the international rule of law.As a United Methodist Christian believing in the sacred value of every human being, I oppose torture and work for its abolition.Therefore, I join with hundreds of diverse religious faith-based organizations coming together through the National Religious Campaign Against Torture to urge the Senate Intelligence Committee to release its report on torture.Rev.
