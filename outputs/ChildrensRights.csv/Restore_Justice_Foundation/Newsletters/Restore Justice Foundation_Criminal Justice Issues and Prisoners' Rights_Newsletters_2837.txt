We are ready for another year in the movement to reform draconian sentencing laws, rid our state of cruel prison conditions, and prevent any further mistreatment of families. We will keep working to eliminate all juvenile life without parole sentences. We will keep advancing measures to support families and keep loved ones together. We will keep demanding more testing, transparency, and early releases for people incarcerated during this pandemic.If you missed the show, don’t worry. You can watch it here.We want to thank each and every person who participates in Stories of Second Chances, everyone who bids on auction items and donates, and all those who help make our first virtual fundraiser a success.Thank you Hoopla Communications and Sweet Baby Media, who helped us take our message and turn it into a “real” event online.Thank you to the After Dark Combo for selecting and recording music for our show:Piano – Abigail PersellGuitar – Nathan AndalmanTrumpet – Asher BaronTrombone – Katherine KoeppenSaxophone – Joanie DayeBass – Soren DorrDrums – Eva DuvallWe also extend a special thank you to Matthew Bufis and the Evanston Township High School Jazz Program.We’d also like to give special thanks to our panelists. These panelists, led by Restore Justice Program Manager Wendell Robinson and Outreach Director Julie Anderson, talked about the ways the criminal legal system tore them and their families apart, but also, about the ways they found hope. Most of the men received juvenile life without parole sentences; the law condemned them to die in prison before they could even vote. Yet, they never started believing, and, alongside advocates and lawyers, they never stopped working. Because of that work and the Supreme Court’s Miller decision, these men are all home. Four of the moms on the panel had sons benefit from Miller. Panelist Cynthia Morfin said she danced alone in her kitchen after hearing the news. “What a joy, what a joy, what a joy,” Olivia Cal declared.Panelists:Adolfo DavisBrian Harrington*Steven HawthorneNelson MorrisWendell Robinson*Brian also performed a resounding spoken word piece, “Untold Grave Conditions.” Thank you, Brian, for your resonant and moving performance.Julie AndersonOlivia CalErin HammondCynthia MorfinEvelyn WingardWe also want to thank everyone who donated (or donates) to our auction, which is open until noon CST on Friday, December 11.
