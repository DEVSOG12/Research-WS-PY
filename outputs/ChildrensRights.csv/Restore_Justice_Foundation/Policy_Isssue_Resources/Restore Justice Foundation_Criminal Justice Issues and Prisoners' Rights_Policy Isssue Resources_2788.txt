A Primer on Parole in Illinois  
April 2018 
 
In 1978, Illinois abolished discretionary parole system . Today, it remains one of just sixteen 
states (plus the D istrict of Columbia) without any means for incarcerated people to earn 
parole . While not the only factor, the aband onment  of parole  has contributed directly to 
increase d sentence lengths  and more crowded pris ons. 
 
I. What is parole ? 
Parole describe s the practice of releasing inmates before the completion of their maximum, 
court -appointed sentence . These released individuals —or parolees —then serve the 
remainder of their sentence under a period of supervise d and conditional r elease , during 
which failure to follow certain rules  may lead to the revocation of parole . 
There are two types of p arole—discretionary and mandatory —that differ in how release is  
granted . 
In discretionary systems, release is granted following a decision by a parole board, which  
grants or withholds parole based on  its assessment  of individual cases . 
In contrast, mandatory systems automatic ally release individu als to parole (i.e. without a 
hearing) when certain  legally binding  conditions are met . This type of parole is reserved for 
individuals serving time for less serious offenses . Mandatory parole can also describe  the 
practice of automatical ly releasing individuals to serve a pre-set final portion of a court -
appointed sentences (e.g. the last 6 months) outside prison walls and under supervision.  
Parole is related to the concepts of indeterminate and determinate sentencing . When a 
person is eligible for discretionary parole, they receive an indeterminate sentence range 
(e.g. 3 to 7 years, 45 to 170 years). Individuals become eligible for parole at the minimum of 
the sentenc e range and may remain behind bars without being granted parole for up to the 
maximum for the rang e, after wh ich they are automatically released . 
In contrast, determinate sentences are set terms (e.g. 8 years, 3 0 months) . Because they 
are predetermined, individual s given determinate sentences cannot earn parole , though 
they still be released earlier than their  court -appointed term through other mechanisms . 
Other types of supervised or early release  
Sometimes, t he term “ parole ” is used to refer to other mechanisms of early release , or 
other types of post-prison supervision . A number of these practices —and how they  differ  
from parole —are described below:  
• Post -sentencing judicial review . Generally , a judge’s sentence is final and 
immutable . Sometimes , however,  states may allow some individuals  to receive  a 
modified sentence . These reviews are often limited to individuals who meet 
certain  narrow criteria . For instance, the  Suprem e Court case Miller v. Alabama  
(and the  following Montgomery v . Louisiana  cases)  outlawed the sentencing  of 
children to mandatory life without parole and required all individuals serving that sentence to receive  new modified sentences . In Illinois, this amounted  to roughly 
one hundre d people . 
    This process is distinct from parole , which  does not change the base sentence 
but rather where and how a sentence is served . Perhaps more saliently , these 
types of review are often narrow, making them  a less common pathway  for early 
release versus parole . 
 
• Executive p ardon s and commutation . Governors have th e power to pardon or 
commute the sentences of inmates held in state prison . Governor s may elect to 
reduce an inmate’s sentence down to “time served,” effectively releasing  the 
inmate . Other times, governors can shorten but not fully commute a sentence to 
a point where the inmate serve s a shortened  period behind bars. In Louisiana, for 
instance, governors can alter life sentences to termed , non-life sentences  (e.g. 
fifty ye ars), which allows those inmates to be eventually released , potentially 
through discretionary  parole . As a rel ease mechanism pardons and commutations 
are powerful . However, they are granted relatively rarely  and alter base 
sentences , unlike parol e. 
 
• Mandatory supervised release (MSR) . In Illinois , individuals convicted of certain 
offenses must serve a mandatory period of post-prison supervision  known as 
MSR. Individuals under MSR must follow the same rules and conditions as parole 
and may be returned to prison for violating  those terms.  
    Unlike parole, MSR terms are alway s served after  the full completion  of a 
court -appointed prison sentence . In this way, MSR functions as an additional  
penalty  for serious crime s and never  as a means  of early release . For that reason , 
it is misguided to consider MSR an appropriate substitute for either discretionary 
or mandatory parole.  
 
II. Reducing repeat crimes or reducing recidivism : not the same thing  
When state legislatures across the nation began abolishing parole in the late  1970s , their 
rationale was often that parole failed to increase public safety or reduce repeat offenses.  
And indeed, old data plus a few isolated cases of parolees committing new serious crimes 
did seem to suggest the inefficiency of parole.  
More up -to-date r esearch now shows discretionary parole can effectively reduce the 
likelihood of new crimes.  The Pew Charitable Trusts  found that parolees in New Jersey 
were 36  percent  less likely to commit new crimes and return to prison compared to “max -
outs,”  or individuals released at the end of their term and without parole supervision. 
Separately, a 2005 study by the Urban Institute  compared the benefits of discretionary 
parole to both unc onditional releases and mandatory parole.1 The authors of the Urban 
study found that for black men with few prior arrests and women, parole could reduce the 
predicted likelihood of their re arrest  by up to 20 and 34 percentage points, respectively, 
compared to unconditional r elease.  
Technical violations, not new crimes, drive most of parole rearrests  
                                                            
1 In Illinois, mandatory supervised release (MSR) may be considered mandatory parole, since MSR individuals 
must follow the same parole guidelines as Illinois’ handful of discretionary parolees.  Some studies suggest parole does not effectively reduce recidivism . These studies  point to 
the comparable rates of recidivism between parolees and individuals released without 
supervision at the end of their prison terms.  
But recidivism definitions are inconsistent. Some sources of data fail to differentiate 
technical violations from new crimes, rearrests from returns to prison, or new felony 
convictions from new misdemeanor convic tions (for more on the topic of recidivism, you 
can check out o ur resource on understanding recidivism ). 
Only parolees and other individuals under parole -like supervision may be arrested and 
returned to prison for technical violations . This can include missing an appointment with a 
parole officer, alcohol consumption, or failing to find a suitable  home.  
When data sources distinguish between technical violations and other offenses , the 
benefits of parole become clearer. For instance, in their 2015 report , the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) reported that while 34  percent  of Illinois’ over 24,300 individuals exiting2 
mandatory supervised release (MSR) or parole returned to prison, only 1 in 5 of these 
individuals were re -imprisoned for new crimes. That means that for all individuals in Illinois 
exiting parole -like supervision in 2015, only about 7  percent  were reincarcerated for new 
offenses.  
These data are especially noteworthy when one considers that the m ajority of “parolees ” in 
Illinois  are on MSR and not parole. This means that most of these released individ uals were 
not granted  release based on a careful assessment of their likelihood  to reoffend.  
People convicted of violent offenses are less likely to reoffend  
Many express concern that granting parole to individuals convicted of violent offenses 
means that —should they offe nd—these individuals will inevitably  commit new violent 
crimes . But the data tells another story . 
Table 1 reports data from BJS on the rates at which individuals with different types of prior 
offense are rearrested, reconvicted or sent back to prison for n ew felony sentences within 
3 years.3 
Table 1. Rates of rearrest, reconviction and returns to prison with new sentence within 3 
years, stratified by number of prior arrests and offense type  
 Rearrested (any 
reason)  Reconvicted 
(misdemeanor or 
felony)  Returned to prison  
<2 prior arrests  
  Homicide  29.8%  13% 6.9% 
  Rape/Sexual 
assault  27.8%  13.9%  7.4% 
  All other violent 
crime4 50.2%  31.6%  16.1%  
                                                            
2 Generally, individuals “exit” parole or mandatory supervised rele ase when they complet e their assigned 
supervisory period or are returned to incarceration.  
3 The rate of reimprisonment is distinct from the rate of reincarceration. Reimprisonment only counts returns to 
prison, whereas the rate of reincarceration counts r eturns to either jail or prison.  
4 Includes robbery and assault, among others ; excludes rape and sexual assault.    All property 
crime5 57.6%  38.6%  22.6%  
  Drug 
poss./traffic  39.2%  23.7%  13.5%  
2 or more prior arrests  
  Homicide  47.1%  25.3%  14% 
  Rape/Sexual 
assault  52% 31% 15.5%  
  All other violent 
crime  71.6%  48.5%  25.8%  
  All property 
crime  75.5%  55.2%  32.4%  
  Drug 
poss./traffic  69.7%  49.3%  26.6%  
Note: Data were sourced from the BJS Pr isoner Recidivism Analysis Tool of 1994. A more recent 2005 dataset 
from BJS only reported rates of rearrest and provides no data on rates of reconviction or reimprisonment.  
These data suggest that:  
• Regardless of the number of prior arrests, people convict ed of violent crimes are less 
likely to return to prison for a new sentence than those convicted of property crimes.  
• While often considered the most irredeemable, individuals convicted of murder are 
least likely to return to prison with new convictions,  especially if they had few prior 
arrests.  
• Regardless of offense type,  individuals with fewer prior arrests are less likely to 
recidivate compared to those with more prior arrests.  
What about the relationship between a person’s original offense and subsequent  ones? 
When they do commit new crimes, are people previously convicted of violent offenses more 
likely to commit new violent felonies upon release?  
A study on from BJS sought to answer this question by examining the correlation between 
a person’s original committing offense and arrests for subsequent, post -release offenses. 
Table 2  recreates a BJS table on 5 -year rearrest rates for prisoners from 30 states, broken 
out by original and post -release offense.

Drug 24.8%  33.1%  51.2%  56.1%  
Public Order  29.2%  32.7%  30.0%  59.6%  
Note: Data were drawn from the BJS Special Report on Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 30 States in 2005: 
Patterns from 2005 to 2010 . 
                                                            
5 Includes burglary, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft, among others  Recal l that rearrests  do not automatically equate to new convictions or prison terms (as 
evidenced in Table 1 ). 
No matter what an individual’s original offense, BJS found that the most serious offense for 
over half of all rearrested individuals were for public order offenses, which include 
disorderly conduct, loitering, and similar crime s. 
And while those convicted of violent crimes were more like than other individuals to be 
rearrested for a violent offense, they are also less likely than individuals convicted of 
property crimes from reoffending in the first place.  
Parole supervision c osts less than incarceration  
According to a 2015 spokesperson  from the  Illinois  Department of Corrections, it costs 
Illinois roughly $22,000 to house an inmate for one year, compared to the $2,000 it costs 
annually to place that person on parole. This lines up with national data from a Pew study 
that put the cost of placing a person behind bars for a single day is on par with 10 days of 
parole supervisi on. 
 
III. Designing parole systems: how other states do it  
Among the 33 states that offer parole, there is wide variation in how parole systems 
operate. States differ in how they define parole eligibility, and how they address re -hearings 
following a decision b y the board to deny parole. Still, a number of trends are evident:  
• Of the 33 states that offer parole,  18 do NOT automatically exclude individuals 
convicted of homicide from earning parole , while 15 do.  
• With few exceptions, states with parole permit indivi duals convicted of violent, non -
homicide offenses to earn parole.  
• Many states with parole restrict eligibility in cases of repeat serious offenses.  
• Many states do not limit the number of times a person’s case may be re -heard.  
• Some states have established  special avenues for children and young people to earn 
parole where they otherwise would not be eligible.  
 
Are individuals convicted of violent offenses eligible for parole in these states?  
States diverge on how individuals convicted of violent offenses are treated in terms of 
parole eligibility. Overall, many (but not all) of states require individuals to serve a longer 
portion of their court -dispensed sentence behind bars (as can be seen in the above 
examples). That said, most states do not allow parole for  individuals who receive 
convictions for separate violent offenses.  
A few more examples:  
• Connecticut . In Connecticut, individuals convicted of one of four violent offenses —
murder, capital felony murder, arson murder, and first -degree aggravated sexual 
assault—are parole -ineligible.  
• Iowa. While most individuals must serve one -third of their indeterminate sentence 
behind bars before becoming parole -eligible, individuals sentenced for a number of 
violent offenses —including second -degree murder, attempted murde r, and first -
degree robbery —only become eligible after serving 70  percent  of their sentence. Individuals convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer and murder committed 
by non -juveniles are parole -ineligible.  
• Nevada . Nevada does not exclude individuals from  parole eligibility based on nature 
of offense, unless those individuals are condemned to death or sentence to life 
without the possibility of parole.  
How many times and how regularly may a person be reconsidered for parole following a 
denial in states tha t offer parole?  
With few outliers, most states with parole do not limit the number of times a case can be 
reheard following a parole denial. Rather, reconsideration is restricted more by the 
limitations states place on the period of time individuals must w ait before applying for re -
hearing. Some states grant parole boards the authority to determine that period, while 
others designate a time window.  
A few examples:  
• California . When California’s parole board chooses to deny parole, it also establishes 
the per iod until an individuals’ case can be reheard. The parole board is allowed to 
set a period of 3, 5, 7, 10 or 15 years, though inmates can file petitions for earlier 
parole reconsideration.  
• Similar states : Connecticut also grants its parole board the author ity to set 
the period until a future re -hearing. Unlike California, however, Connecticut’s 
parole board may choose to indefinitely deny further hearings. Missouri’s 
parole board also assigns wait periods following denial, on the order of 1 to 5 
years.  
• Geor gia. For non -life sentences, individuals are automatically reconsidered for parole 
every 5 years following a denial; individuals serving life are reconsidered every 8 
years.  
• Similar states: West Virginia permits annual re -hearings for most sentences, 
and e very 3 years for life sentences. Once a person has served their 
mandatory minimum, Iowa requires annual re -hearings for individuals denied 
parole, unless that person is serving a life sentence.  
• Louisiana . Following a denial, individuals may request a re -hearing after (1) six 
months for non -violent offenses; (2) annually for violent offenses; or (3) two years 
for sex offenses murder, or manslaughter. Requests do not guarantee a re -hearing, 
and requests may be denied for up to ten years , after which an indivi dual’s case for 
parole must be reconsidered.

and every 3 years for life sentences. Once a person has served th eir 
mandatory minimum, Iowa requires annual re -hearings for individuals denied 
parole, unless that person is serving a life sentence.  
• Louisiana . Following a denial, individuals may request a re -hearing after (1) six 
months for non -violent offenses; (2) ann ually for violent offenses; or (3) two years 
for sex offenses murder, or manslaughter. Requests do not guarantee a re -hearing, 
and requests may be denied for up to ten years , after which an individual’s case for 
parole must be reconsidered.  
What sort of yo uth-specific parole (or parole -like) systems exist in other states?  
Many states have enacted policies that provide special consideration to individuals who 
enter prison as young people. A few examples:  
• California . Individuals serving long sentences for off enses committed  before age 23 
become eligible for parole review after 15, 20, or 25 years served. This program 
excludes individuals serving sentences for certain sex offenses or multiple prior 
violent felonies.  
• Connecticut . As of 2015, Connecticut retroac tively granted parole eligibility to 
individuals who entered prison before age 18 with sentences of 10 years or longer.  
For individuals serving sentences 50 or less years, parole eligibility is granted after 
the longer of 60% of sentence served or 12 years ; individuals serving longer 
sentences become eligible after 30 years.  • Florida . For juveniles sentenced to life, Florida grants eligibility for a post -sentencing 
judicial review after 15, 20, or 25 years served, depending on the offense. While 
similar in s ome ways, post -sentencing review is not the same as parole, since the 
granting of parole does not change the original sentence. Individuals granted a 
reduced sentence under this program must serve a mandatory probation period of up 
to 5 years.  
• Iowa. In Iow a, individuals convicted of first -degree murder or sexual assault leading 
to serious injury are ineligible for parole  unless the individual was under 18 at the 
commission of offense, in which case parole eligibility is granted at 25 years.
