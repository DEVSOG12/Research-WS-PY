For those who return after serving twenty years or longer, barriers to finding housing and employment compound with the unfamiliarity of a world that runs on smart phones, email, and all manner of other conventions that inmates have little to no exposure to behind bars.A number of organizations in and around Chicago offer aid and programs to returning citizens. These services include everything from housing help and job training to legal aid for expunging of records.With a big hand from John McLees at Incarceration Reform, Restore Justice has compiled a number of these sources below. We’ll also update this page semi-regularly with new resources.Employment ResourcesCara Chicago runs a full-time training program and directly employs returning citizens through two transitional job programs: Cleanslate,which focuses on maintenance, landscaping, and snow removal; and Cara Connects, a contract staffing firm that fills short-term, entry level positions in industries as wide-ranging as food service, hospitality, healthcare, and warehousing.Location: 237 S Desplaines St, Chicago, IL 60661 (West Loop) & 4655 S.

RCN meetings are held monthly in Chicago. The meetings are led by Restore Justice staff and attended by recently Returning Citizens who were incarcerated for lengthy adult sentences as youth.These Returning Citizens served decades in the Illinois Department of Corrections and share many  similar experiences. RCN hopes to provide the opportunity and space for these individuals to come together to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and first-hand information about the challenges they face re-entering society after such long periods of incarceration. Some of the goals of RCN are peer support, networking and locating the resources Returning Citizens need to lead positive and productive lives.Some of the topics that have been discussed at past meetings include meeting basic needs, sharing job leads, finding available community resources, and engaging in advocacy and civic engagement. Many of the group participants have “hit the ground running,” by immediately getting involved in community organizing and criminal justice reform following  their release.In the future, the Returning Citizens Network plans to host events and outings where members can share their stories, develop leadership and advocacy skills, engage in self-care, and improve their skills to cope with everyday challenges.If you, or someone you know, would like to join our growing network of Returning Citizens, please call (312) 809-6992 and ask about the “Returning Citizens Network” or email info@restorejusticeillinois.org.Visit Restore Justice Illinois to join the fight for a fairer criminal justice system.Take ActionMailing Address: Restore Justice FoundationPO Box 101099Chicago, IL 60610Follow UsSubscribe:First NameLast NameEmail address:Street AddressCityStateZIPCountryCountryAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Saint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBritish Virgin IslandsBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCook IslandsCosta RicaCroatiaCubaCuracaoCyprusCzech RepublicDemocratic Republic of the CongoDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEast TimorEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyIvory CoastJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian TerritoryPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRepublic of the CongoReunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthelemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluU.S. Virgin IslandsUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVaticanVenezuelaVietnamWallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweLeave this field empty if you're human:Δ© 2020 Restore Justice & Restore Justice Illinois.
