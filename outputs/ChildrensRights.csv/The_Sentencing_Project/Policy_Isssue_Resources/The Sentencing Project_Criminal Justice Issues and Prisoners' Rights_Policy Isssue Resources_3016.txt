But are life sentences actually humane?Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationOn Wednesday, a jury will begin deliberations on whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers, should be executed for his crime.In his case, a sentence of life without parole is seen as the more humane option. The alternative is death, and “there is some evidence that, as states turn more to life without parole, it is partly from a humane desire to move away from the ultimate punishment,” reports the Christian Science Monitor. “Yet the rapid expansion of life without parole also speaks the array of laws, spawned by the get-tough-on-crime 1980s, that remain on the books and mandate such sentences.”The Sentencing Project has documented a historic rise in life sentences in the United States, with the lifer population more than quadrupled in size since 1984 while violent crime rates have continued to decline.Meanwhile, a growing body of research suggests many people “age out” of criminal behavior. A 2004 report by The Sentencing Project notes that individuals released after receiving life sentences with parole were rearrested at much lower rates than the overall prison population – 21 percent versus 68 percent.Nearly 2,500 of the 50,000 inmates sentenced to life without parole were convicted of crimes that occurred before they turned 18, The Sentencing Project found.“People will debate if people are deserving of long term sentences and if societies should punish, and that’s a legitimate debate to have,” says Marc Mauer, director of The Sentencing Project. “[But] we do know there are many people who have changed substantially after a couple decades of incarceration and don’t present nearly the public safety risk they did at the time of their crime.”Read the full article at the Christian Science Monitor.Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationRelated PostspublicationsMay 27, 2021Letter in Support of the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and First Step Implementation ActAmy FettigIn a letter of support submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, The Sentencing Project's Executive Director Amy Fettig expressed the importance of advancing the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act (S.312) and the First Step Implementation Act (S.1014).Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesDrug PolicypublicationsFebruary 17, 2021No End In Sight: America's Enduring Reliance on Life ImprisonmentAshley NellisIn the United States, more than 200,000 people are serving life sentences – one out of every seven in prison.Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign UpTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1 in 6Latinx men born in 2001 can expect to go to prison in their lifetimeMore Facts1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
