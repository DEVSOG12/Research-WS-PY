Overall, the number of people held in state and federal prisons has declined by 4.9% since reaching its peak in 2009. Sixteen states have achieved double-digit rates of decline and the federal system has downsized at almost twice the national rate. But while 38 states have reduced their prison populations, in most states this change has been relatively modest. In addition, 12 states have continued to expand their prison populations even though most have shared in the nationwide crime drop.Six states have reduced their prison populations by over 20% since reaching their peak levels:New Jersey (35% decline since 1999)New York (29% decline since 1999)Alaska (27% decline since 2006)California (26% decline since 2006, though partly offset by increasing jail use)Vermont (25% decline since 2009)Connecticut (22% decline since 2007)Southern states including Mississippi, South Carolina, and Louisiana, which have exceptionally high rates of incarceration, have also begun to significantly downsize their prison populations. These reductions have come about through a mix of changes in policy and practice designed to reduce admissions to prison and lengths of stay. Moreover, the states with the most substantial prison population reductions have often outpaced the nationwide crime drop.The pace of decarceration has been very modest in most states, especially given that nationwide violent and property crime rates have fallen by half since 1991. Despite often sharing in these crime trends, 15 states had less than a 5% prison population decline since their peak year. Moreover, 12 states have continued to expand their prison populations, with four producing double-digit increases since 2010: North Dakota, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Minnesota.Just as mass incarceration has developed primarily as a result of changes in policy, not crime rates, so too have declines reflected changes in both policy and practice. These have included such measures as drug sentencing reforms, reduced admissions to prison for technical parole violations, and diversion options for persons convicted of lower-level property and drug crimes.Change in state and federal prison populationsJurisdictionPeak Year to 2015Peak YearNew Jersey-34.9%1999New York-29.2%1999Alaska-27.4%2006California-25.7%2006Vermont-25.2%2009Connecticut-22.1%2007Michigan-17.4%2006Maine-16.2%2007Mississippi-16.0%2008Hawaii-14.8%2005Rhode Island-14.5%2008Colorado-13.9%2008Massachusetts-13.2%2011South Carolina-13.2%2009Idaho-12.0%2012Maryland-10.4%2007Louisiana-9.5%2012Federal-9.3%2011Indiana-8.6%2013Utah-8.3%2013Georgia-6.9%2009Illinois-6.3%2012Iowa-6.1%2010Alabama-5.3%2012US total-4.9%2009Texas-4.5%2010Wisconsin-3.8%2006Pennsylvania-3.5%2011South Dakota-3.1%2013Florida-2.8%2010Nevada-2.3%2007Tennessee-2.1%2014New Hampshire-1.1%2007Arkansas-0.9%2014Montana-0.8%2010North Carolina-0.7%2014Nebraska-0.7%2014Kentucky-0.6%2007Delaware-0.3%2007Washington0.0%2010Change in state and federal prison populationsJurisdiction2010 to 2015Peak YearOhio1.0%2015Virginia2.7%2015Oregon2.7%2015Missouri5.6%2015New Mexico5.7%2015Kansas5.8%2015Arizona6.6%2015West Virginia7.2%2015Minnesota10.2%2015Oklahoma14.7%2015Wyoming14.8%2015North Dakota19.9%2015Source: Prisoners Series (1999-2015), Bureau of Justice Statistics.Note: Idaho and Illinois data may not be fully comparable across years.U.S. prison population trends through 2015: decreases from peak year, increases from 2010Source: Prisoners Series (1999-2015), Bureau of Justice Statistics.Note: Idaho and Illinois data may not be fully comparable across years.Download PDFIncarcerationRelated PostspublicationsMay 27, 2021Letter in Support of the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and First Step Implementation ActAmy FettigIn a letter of support submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, The Sentencing Project's Executive Director Amy Fettig expressed the importance of advancing the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act (S.312) and the First Step Implementation Act (S.1014).Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesDrug PolicypublicationsFebruary 17, 2021No End In Sight: America's Enduring Reliance on Life ImprisonmentAshley NellisIn the United States, more than 200,000 people are serving life sentences – one out of every seven in prison.Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up1 in 50Children in the United States has a parent in prisonMore FactsTake ActionActions related toIncarcerationSupport the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and the First Step Implementation ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
