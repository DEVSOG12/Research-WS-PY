Police found no evidence of Gaines having possessed or sold drugs, yet federal prosecutors charged Gaines with drug conspiracy.Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyGender JusticeDorothy Gaines was a former nurse and devoted mother living in Mobile, Alabama. A self-described “PTA mom,” she always brought snacks to the football field where her son played on the team and her daughter was a cheerleader.Their lives turned upside down in August 1993, when Alabama state police raided her home for drugs. Police found no evidence of Gaines having possessed or sold drugs, and Gaines maintains that she did not know that her then-boyfriend was dealing drugs. Though the state dropped all charges, federal prosecutors charged Gaines with drug conspiracy eight months later – charges that she disputes to this day. She refused to plead guilty or provide testimony against other defendants, but was convicted and was sentenced to serve 19 years and 7 months.“My son jumped in the judge’s lap at sentencing and asked not to take away his mother,” said Gaines.Leaving her children, Natasha, 19, Chara, 11, and Philip, 9, parentless, Gaines was accompanied by marshals to federal prison – her first time on an airplane.“I was always a mother that never, ever went anywhere without my children. I missed taking my children to the park, going to their school,” said Gaines. “While I was in prison, they wrote me and told me those were the days that they missed, too. Phillip and Chara’s father died when they were two and three. That’s why my children were so distraught: because all that was taken away.”While Gaines served years in prison away from her children, attempts made by her family, friends and advocates to fight on her behalf resulted in national attention to the crack cocaine disparity and sentencing inequalities. Finally, in December 2000, Gaines received a commutation from President Bill Clinton.After her release, Gaines did not forget about the many other women with whom she spent six years in prison. “Since I’ve been out, I’ve been fighting every day of my life. There are other people, other Dorothy Gaineses that are on the inside.”Gaines’s advocacy work has included sharing her story at lobby day events, schools, and churches, and counseling the families of those who are waiting for their loved ones’ return. She has used her own resources to help youth see their incarcerated parents, and she has also created a curriculum for public schools called “Holding the Bag,” which teaches youth to be cautious about taking on others’ belongings.“My going to prison has not been in vain,” said Gaines. “I will fight until everything has been changed.”Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyGender JusticeRelated PostspublicationsOctober 25, 2022Locked Out 2022: Estimates of People Denied Voting RightsChristopher Uggen, Ryan Larson, Sarah Shannon, and Robert StewartAn estimated 4.6 million Americans are barred from voting due to a felony conviction.Download PDFRead OnlinenewsOctober 03, 2022October is Youth Justice Action Month!October is Youth Justice Action Month! Our network of allied advocates and supporters use this month to celebrate the actions we’ve taken in the movement to end youth incarceration and provide all youth with the support they need to thrive.Youth JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up1 in 3Black men born in 2001 can expect to go to prison in their lifetimeMore FactsTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
