Our grounding in the movement to end violence is not only to organize, but to mobilize our communities towards healthier families and healthier communities. Our work gives us unique insight into how to increase social change and gender justice advocacy through community-based solutions to violence. The voices of our communities, and the strengths of our women and children, shape our priorities and approach.Training & EducationAs part of its mission, CSVANW provides several training opportunities to its members and those working in the domestic violence and sexual assault field in tribal communities.Technical AssistanceTechnical Assistance is the work that strengthens our communities and increases the capacity of our tribal programs to serve and support survivors of violence.Policy AdvocacyThe CSVANW Team participates on a wide range of tribal and statewide committees, taskforces and groups to ensure that our Coalition policy advocacy focuses on centering the experiences, strengths and needs of our Native survivors of violence.Community SupportBuilding and sharing space with our communities is the foundation that grounds our mission, vision and work at the Coalition.Native Youth InitiativesAt the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women, it is important for us to implement and design specific initiatives to engage with Indigenous youth across the state of New Mexico.Community Conversations Book ClubThe Book Club grew from our team’s interest in reading and holding space for conversation.Little One Holiday Book DriveThe Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women partners with the local, Native-owned book stores every holiday season for our annual “Little One Book Drive.”Impact ReportsEach year the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women produces an Annual Impact Report that provides an opportunity to reflect on some of our collective achievements from last year.Request FormsDownload the Presentation Request form or the Travel Scholarship Request form.As a tribal coalition, CSVANW does not provide emergency or directs services.If you are in an unsafe situation or need immediate assistance please dial 911.For a safe, confidential way to talk with someone right now, please call:Rape Abuse Incest National Network: 1-800-656-4673 (HOPE)www.rainn.orgNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE)www.ndvh.orgStrong Hearts Native Helpline: 1-844-762-8483www.strongheartshelpline.orgWho Are WeWe focus our work on communities and systems.
