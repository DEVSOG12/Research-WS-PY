Discrimination of marginalized groups by teachers and other students, long distances to school, formal and informal school fees, and the absence of inclusive education are among the main causes. Millions stop going to school to work long hours, often under hazardous conditions. Others experience violence or abuse from teachers or fellow students, or find their schools targets of armed attack. Families do not send girls to school, force them out of school to marry or girls are denied an education when they become pregnant. Many are kept from getting a secondary education because they cannot afford school fees. Even when in school, millions of children receive a poor quality education that leaves them lacking essential skills and knowledge.© 2013 Justin Purefoy for Human Rights WatchGlobalMay 17, 2021Report“Years Don’t Wait for Them”Bede SheppardDeputy Director, Children's Rights DivisionElin MartínezSenior Researcher, Children's Rights DivisionHye Jung HanResearcher and Advocate, Children's Rights DivisionAfricaAugust 29, 2022InteractiveA Brighter Future: Empowering Pregnant Girls and Adolescent Mothers to Stay in SchoolEurope/Central AsiaOctober 3, 2022DispatchesKyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Conflict Leaves Children without EducationSyinat SultanalievaResearcher, Europe and Central Asia DivisionVideosWatch moreVideosKids Talk Covid and SchoolsIndonesia: Dress Codes Discriminate Against Women, GirlsChildren in Ecuador at High Risk of Sexual Violence in SchoolReportsMore reportsAugust 30, 2022ReportAcross Africa, Many Young Mothers Face Education BarriersAfrican Union Guidance, Policy Reforms Needed to Ensure Girls Continue EducationAugust 8, 2022ReportRacial Discrimination in the United StatesHuman Rights Watch / ACLU Joint Submission Regarding the United States’ Record Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial DiscriminationJune 27, 2022ReportCameroon: Separatist Abuses in Anglophone RegionsProsecute, Sanction Fighters for Crimes Against CiviliansMay 25, 2022Report“How Dare They Peep into My Private Life?”Children’s Rights Violations by Governments that Endorsed Online Learning During the Covid-19 PandemicNewsOctober 14, 2022StatementGuatemala: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-SessionOctober 7, 2022StatementBenin: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-sessionOctober 3, 2022StatementThailand: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-sessionOctober 3, 2022DispatchesKyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Conflict Leaves Children without EducationBoth Countries Should Endorse Safe Schools DeclarationSeptember 21, 2022StatementArmenia: Submissionto the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women83rd SessionSeptember 2, 2022DispatchesSchool-Related Sexual Violence Cases at Alarming Levels in EcuadorStudents Suffer High-Levels of Sexual Abuse, Rape and Impunity at SchoolAugust 30, 2022InterviewInterview: New Niger Order Protects Girls’ Rights to EducationAugust 30, 2022ReportAcross Africa, Many Young Mothers Face Education BarriersAfrican Union Guidance, Policy Reforms Needed to Ensure Girls Continue EducationAugust 4, 2022CommentaryAfrica: Countries Should Remove Barriers That Keep Young Mothers Out of SchoolJuly 13, 2022StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child Review of Mauritius91st Pre-sessionJuly 13, 2022StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child Review of New Zealand91st Pre-sessionJuly 13, 2022News ReleaseAfghanistan: Toll of Ban on Girls’ Secondary Education300 Days on, Video Feature Shows Harmful ImpactRead MoreA Brighter FutureEmpowering pregnant girls and adolescent mothers to stay in school.A Human Rights Watch indexDaily BriefOct 26, 2022Preventing Intimidation in US Elections; Landmark Declaration on Explosive Weapons; Dam Trouble in Kyrgyzstan; Take Note; Listen: Qatar’s Abuses of LGBT People; Watch: Speaking on Xinjiang at the UN; On Our Terms: Impunity.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
