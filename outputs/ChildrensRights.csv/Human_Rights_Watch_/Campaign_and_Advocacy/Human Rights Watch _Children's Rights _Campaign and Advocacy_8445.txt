It will also protect state funding for agencies that provide counseling or educational services in line with agencies’ religious beliefs – something advocates worry could lead to conversation therapy for LGBT kids.Beyond the LGBT context, the law opens the door for agencies to discriminate on other grounds – for example, to reject prospective parents based on their faith or marital status or to require Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or atheist children in their care to submit to Christian instruction.This law is even more stringent than similar laws passed in South Dakota and Alabama in 2017. Not only does it license discrimination in adoption and foster care services, but it also applies to Texas’ family preservation and support services, counseling for youth, and programs to assist abused and neglected children.This isn’t the only way LGBT people are being discriminated against in Texas. A special legislative session, starting on July 18, will have restrictions on transgender students’ access to bathrooms and locker rooms on the agenda – something our research shows jeopardize the safety, health, and well-being of young people.Instead of doubling down on discrimination, Governor Abbott and the legislature should put children first, and work to ensure that all youth in Texas have loving homes and safe schools.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights LGBT RightsMore ReadingDecember 7, 2016News ReleaseUnited States: LGBT Students Face DiscriminationDecember 6, 2016MapUnited States Anti-LGBT MapReportsNovember 18, 2021Report“I Just Try to Make It Home Safe”Violence and the Human Rights of Transgender People in the United StatesMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisMore ReadingDecember 7, 2016News ReleaseUnited States: LGBT Students Face DiscriminationDecember 6, 2016MapUnited States Anti-LGBT MapMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
