Wade on June 24, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people across the United States were horrified to learn that, in addition to having protection of key reproductive rights rolled back, their marriages and relationships could be next. In his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the Court reconsider past rulings enshrining constitutional rights to contraception and same-sex marriage and relationships.The case of a lesbian mother in Oklahoma fighting for legal parenthood of her child demonstrates what happens when states get to decide which rights queer people deserve. In January 2022, an Oklahoma court removed Kris Williams from her child’s birth certificate, replacing it with the name of the sperm donor, who is now petitioning for custody of Williams’ son.Williams and her wife Rebekah Wilson conceived their child in 2019, and her wife gave birth. When the couple filed for divorce two years later, Wilson petitioned the court to remove Williams from the birth certificate. The judge ruled in favor, stating that as the non-gestational mother, Williams had “failed to pursue a legal remedy to establish parental rights.” According to the judge, Williams should have adopted her own son. The court will rule on legal parentage at an August hearing.Supreme Court rulings in 2015 and 2017 afforded same-sex couples the same parental rights and responsibilities as different-sex couples. The Oklahoma court’s assertions in Williams’ case deny her the rights granted to married different-sex couples. The case highlights the persistent precarity of legal parenthood for lesbians, particularly those who do not give birth to their children.Requiring non-gestational lesbian parents to adopt their children also reifies racial and class inequities in the US. Adoption requires financial resources, legal representation, and criminal background checks. Systemic racism and racist policing have produced an overrepresentation of lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ+) women of color in the criminal justice system. They are subjected to high rates of police violence, denied their rights to adequate legal representation and fair trial, caught in cycles of incarceration, and face discriminatory treatment by institutions such as Child Protective Services if they become parents.State courts like Oklahoma’s should affirm rather than erode the rights of LGBT parents, and legislatures should pass LGBT-inclusive parental recognition bills.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights LGBT RightsMore ReadingJune 27, 2022CommentaryThe Americas Should Unify in a Marriage Equality BlocMay 24, 2022DispatchesOklahoma’s Bathroom Ban Will Endanger Transgender ChildrenReportsNovember 18, 2021Report“I Just Try to Make It Home Safe”Violence and the Human Rights of Transgender People in the United StatesMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisMore ReadingJune 27, 2022CommentaryThe Americas Should Unify in a Marriage Equality BlocMay 24, 2022DispatchesOklahoma’s Bathroom Ban Will Endanger Transgender ChildrenMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
