Use this example letter, or draft one in your own words, to send to your representative urging him or her to support this important bill.Click here to find out who your Representative is in the Louisiana House of Representatives.Dear Representative,As my elected representative to the Louisiana House of Representatives, I urge you to vote “yes” for HB 783, which would end Louisiana’s executions of people under the age of 18 at the time of the crime.In March, South Dakota and Wyoming passed legislation that forbids the execution of offenders who were 17 or younger at the age when they committed their crime and the New Hampshire legislature just passed a similar bill that now awaits the governor’s signature.Louisiana now has the opportunity to join the ranks of states that have ended this practice and it should act decisively to protect the rights of children, even as it acts to ensure appropriate punishment for child offenders.The death penalty for juvenile offenders has been abandoned by countries all over the world.International treaties and customary international law forbid capital punishment for offenders under the age of 18 at the time of the offense for which they were convicted. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo are the only other countries that are known to defy the worldwide consensus that the death penalty should not be imposed on child offenders.The death penalty is a form of punishment unique in its cruelty and is inevitably carried out in an arbitrary manner, inflicted primarily on the most vulnerable—the poor, the mentally ill, and persons of color.The intrinsic fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons may be executed.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,(Your Name Here)Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
