This was one of several conditions the administration cast as prerequisites for any legislative deal to protect the Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.Another of Trump’s demands would mean that instead of being interviewed by an asylum officer, child asylum seekers would be thrown immediately into immigration courts where they would be pitted against a government trial attorney – a difficult situation for anyone, let alone a child.There’s something deeply cynical about endangering one group of children as a condition for protecting another.Reading these demands, I thought of the soft-spoken 16-year-old Salvadoran boy I met in California. Eddie (not his real name) told me he left his home “because I had a problem with the gang.” More accurately, the gang had a problem with him – he repeatedly ducked their requests to join, and they gave him an ultimatum: The next time they saw him, he would either join them or be killed.Over the past two years I’ve interviewed nearly 100 Central American children like Eddie. Girls as young as 14 told me they escaped gang members who threatened to kill them or their families if they didn’t become their “girlfriends” or sell drugs for them. Boys said local gangs demanded part of their meagre earnings – more than they could afford – for working in their territory. Gangs also threatened to kill them, accusing them of associating with rival gangs, and tried to recruit them against their will.It’s not enough to say authorities in Central America should address gang violence. Local police are demonstrably unable to protect these children – and frequently unwilling to do so – lest they become targets themselves.Nor is it realistic to suggest that Mexico can protect these children. Mexico recognized just 130 unaccompanied Central American children as refugees in 2016, less than 1 percent of the more than 17,000 unaccompanied children from those countries who were apprehended during the year. And this is just a fraction of the likely need. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that as many as half of the unaccompanied children who arrive in Mexico from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have plausible asylum claims.Proposing that the US send back children fleeing for their lives is cruel. Lawmakers shouldn’t accept a false choice between protecting Dreamers and other children arriving in search of safety. In fact, there’s every reason for Congress to protect both groups.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States ImmigrationTopicChildren's Rights Migrant and Refugee Children Refugees and Migrants Asylum SeekersMore ReadingSeptember 27, 2017DispatchesUS White House Immigration Plan Has No HeartSeptember 18, 2017CommentaryDonald Trump's Immigration Crackdown Will Be DeadlyReportsAugust 8, 2022ReportRacial Discrimination in the United StatesHuman Rights Watch / ACLU Joint Submission Regarding the United States’ Record Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial DiscriminationFebruary 10, 2022Report“How Can You Throw Us Back?”Asylum Seekers Abused in the US and Deported to Harm in CameroonMore ReadingSeptember 27, 2017DispatchesUS White House Immigration Plan Has No HeartSeptember 18, 2017CommentaryDonald Trump's Immigration Crackdown Will Be DeadlyMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
