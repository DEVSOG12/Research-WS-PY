While my sister was receiving medical care, my family lost our immigration status. My parents made the courageous decision to overstay their visas to fight for my sister’s life. She is still alive today as a result.DACA protections made it possible for me to become a registered nurse, volunteer with the NYC Medical Reserve Corps on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic, become an attorney, and work as the Aryeh Neier Fellow at Human Rights Watch.While DACA has been a lifeline for me and hundreds of thousands of other hardworking young people, it has been challenging to plan my life in two-year increments. DACA requires that I apply for work authorization and protection from deportation every two years. Earlier this year my fellowship was at risk because my status was set to expire. Former President Donald Trump’s termination of the program and subsequent litigation have threatened to rip this protection from me, jeopardizing my future.DACA was always intended to be a “temporary stop-gap measure” according to President Obama, who said, “This is not amnesty, this is not immunity, this is not a path to citizenship, this is not a permanent fix.” However, despite widespread support for better protections, Congress has failed to take action in the last decade, leaving the 800,000 of us who have DACA protections in limbo and tens of thousands more vulnerable to deportation. After a Texas judge ruled that DACA was unlawful last July, the federal government ceased processing new applications from DACA-eligible immigrants and those whose DACA expired more than a year ago.This should not continue.I and many others are gathering today in rallies across the country to call on Congress to pass legislation to transform the country’s outdated and inhumane immigration system and provide deeply rooted immigrants with a pathway to citizenship. Our lives, and my future, depend on it.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States ImmigrationTopicChildren's RightsMore ReadingJune 7, 2022DispatchesBill Could Protect California Immigrants from DeportationMay 1, 2022CommentaryUS is Playing Politics with Migrant LivesReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingJune 7, 2022DispatchesBill Could Protect California Immigrants from DeportationMay 1, 2022CommentaryUS is Playing Politics with Migrant LivesMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
