Approximately 1.7 percent of people have an intersex trait, meaning intersex variations are not uncommon, just often misunderstood. Human Rights Watch works to document and advocate against all surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred.AsiaOctober 18, 2021DispatchesAustralia Moves Closer to Ending Harmful Intersex SurgeriesElaine PearsonAsia DirectorKyle KnightSenior Researcher, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights ProgramUnited StatesSeptember 1, 2021DispatchesProtest Demands End to Harmful Surgeries on Intersex ChildrenKyle KnightSenior Researcher, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights ProgramUnited StatesDecember 13, 2019DispatchesMassachusetts Medical Society Supports Intersex RightsKyle KnightSenior Researcher, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights ProgramVideosWatch moreVideosVideo: End Irreversible Genital Surgeries on Intersex Infants in the USUS: Doctors Still Do Harmful Surgeries on Intersex KidsReportsMore reportsOctober 26, 2017ReportA Changing ParadigmUS Medical Provider Discomfort with Intersex Care PracticesJuly 25, 2017Report“I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me”Medically Unnecessary Surgeries on Intersex Children in the USNewsOctober 18, 2021DispatchesAustralia Moves Closer to Ending Harmful Intersex SurgeriesRights Body Urges End to Early ‘Normalizing’ Interventions on ChildrenSeptember 1, 2021DispatchesProtest Demands End to Harmful Surgeries on Intersex ChildrenHospital Should Halt Medically Unnecessary SurgeriesNovember 24, 2020StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child’s review of the United Kingdom88th pre-sessionOctober 29, 2020ImpactUS Hospital to Stop Harmful Intersex Surgeries on ChildrenHospital is First Institution to Make This Change and Apologize for Harm DoneMarch 13, 2020LetterHuman Rights Watch Letter Re: House Bill 303 and Health Care for Transgender and Intersex ChildrenFebruary 3, 2020LetterHuman Rights Watch Letter Re: South Dakota HB 1057 and the Rights of Transgender and Intersex ChildrenDecember 13, 2019DispatchesMassachusetts Medical Society Supports Intersex RightsElective Surgeries Should Be Patient’s ChoiceAugust 29, 2019DispatchesIndian State Bans Unnecessary Surgery on Intersex ChildrenNew Government Committee Should Include Intersex PerspectivesApril 29, 2019CommentaryIndian Court Decides In Favor of Informed Consent Rights for Intersex PeopleOctober 25, 2018DispatchesPush is on in Australia to End Intersex AbusesRights Commission Consultation Exposes Harmful, Unnecessary Medical PracticesOctober 12, 2018DispatchesMedical Experts Call to Defer Unnecessary Intersex SurgeriesNew European Guidelines Reflect Intersex Patient Advocates’ ViewsOctober 10, 2018CommentaryThe Intersex Guidelines Doctors Have Been Waiting ForRead MoreDaily BriefOct 26, 2022Preventing Intimidation in US Elections; Landmark Declaration on Explosive Weapons; Dam Trouble in Kyrgyzstan; Take Note; Listen: Qatar’s Abuses of LGBT People; Watch: Speaking on Xinjiang at the UN; On Our Terms: Impunity.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
