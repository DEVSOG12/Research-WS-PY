Human Rights Watch has advocated for passage of the bill.“California’s new law has the potential to dramatically change the lives of thousands of young offenders,” said Elizabeth Calvin, senior children’s rights advocate at Human Rights Watch. “With this law California will help protect the young people it sends to prison from being raped, beaten, or forced to join gangs.”Approximately 4,800 people under age 22 are admitted to California prisons each year. Under current practice many are routinely sent to the maximum security prison units, known as “Level IV yards,” where young inmates are very vulnerable to assault, rape, and other violence, and come in close contact with prison’s most negative influences.In the Level IV yards, gang members and others prey upon young people. The maximum security units also offer fewer rehabilitative and educational services. Under the new law, California recognizes that young people need special protections and deserve increased access to educational opportunities.“This new law recognizes both the vulnerability and potential of young offenders,” Calvin said. “It means fewer young adults will be raped and assaulted in prison. They won’t be forced to turn to gangs for protection or in despair, and will have greater access to educational programs.”Human Rights Watch has collected the personal accounts of more than 500 prisoners in California sent to maximum security prison units when they were young. The great majority said having the chance to enter prison away from the most hardened prisoners would have made a tremendous difference in their lives.“I came to prison at the age of 20 and it was very hard for me as a younger person being around older men who was crazy,” wrote J. M., who was 15 at the time of his crime. “I had to listen to them tell me what to do, wrong or right. I had to listen to them or be hurt. It messed with my mind 24-7.” Another inmate, E.T. told Human Rights Watch:I really think my life would have been different if I would have been placed [at a lower level yard when I entered prison,] … I wouldn’t have been exposed to so much violence and hatred … I would have been acquiring … [things like education and vocational skills.] Instead I had to focus on surviving and staying alive. There were nights I silently cried myself to sleep because of the fear I felt.“Whether living in a college dorm or a prison cell, young adults have to make important decisions about their identity and path in life,” Calvin said. “Young people are more susceptible than older adults to influences around them, both good and bad. This new law is an opportunity to positively shape the direction of a young person’s life.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal JusticeTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
