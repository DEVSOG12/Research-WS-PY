They may be denied access to adequate medical services and education, abused and mistreated by police, guards, and other detainees, and unable to seek asylum. They may languish in jail-like detention facilities, in conditions that are often degrading and inhumane, and many children are held in cells with adults who are strangers. Children held in detention, particularly for long periods with no release in sight, suffer lasting consequences, physically and mentally. Detention can create new traumas or exacerbate previous ones.MexicoMay 31, 2022ReportUS: LGBT Asylum Seekers in Danger at the BorderMiddle East/North AfricaMay 6, 2022News ReleaseLebanon: Credible Plans Needed on Education CrisisUnited StatesMay 1, 2022CommentaryUS is Playing Politics with Migrant LivesClara LongAssociate Director, US ProgramAri SawyerUS Border Researcher, US ProgramPublished in:Published in the Bangor Daily NewsVideosWatch moreVideosSyria: Returning Refugees Face Grave AbuseFrontex Should Protect People at EU External BordersReauthorize Cross-Border Aid into Northern SyriaReportsMore reportsSeptember 1, 2022Report“We Had No Choice”“Filtration” and the Crime of Forcibly Transferring Ukrainian Civilians to RussiaMay 31, 2022ReportUS: LGBT Asylum Seekers in Danger at the BorderBiden Should Immediately Safeguard At-Risk Groups, Restore Asylum AccessApril 7, 2022Report“Their Faces Were Covered”Greece’s Use of Migrants as Police Auxiliaries in PushbacksMarch 28, 2022ReportColombia/Venezuela: Border Area Abuses by Armed GroupsKillings, Disappearances, Child Recruitment, Forced DisplacementNewsOctober 26, 2022LetterOver 70 Rights Groups Denounce Racially Motivated Texas ShootingOctober 24, 2022LetterNGO Sign-On Letter to Inter-American Commission on Human RightsOver 200 Groups Write in Support of the Family of Anastasio Hernández Rojas in Their Petition Before the IACHRJune 20, 2022StatementEnd Violence and Serious Human Rights Violations Against Afghan RefugeesMay 6, 2022News ReleaseLebanon: Credible Plans Needed on Education CrisisDonors Should Press Ministry to Improve Access, Transparency; End Policy BarriersMay 1, 2022CommentaryUS is Playing Politics with Migrant LivesApril 28, 2022StatementBangladesh: Restore and Strengthen Capacity of Community-Led Schools in Rohingya CampJoint StatementApril 28, 2022CommentaryUS Immigration Enforcement and US Obligations Under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD)Written Testimony Submitted to the US State Department and other Federal Agencies, Alison Parker, US Program, Human Rights WatchApril 21, 2022LetterLeaders of Human Rights Groups Urge Biden to Safeguard Asylum Access in the USApril 19, 2022LetterLetters to Humanitarian Donor Governments on Education for Rohingya Refugee Children in BangladeshApril 15, 2022CommentaryHRW Submission to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human RightsUpdated April 15, 2022March 22, 2022StatementOver 40 Children’s Advocacy Organizations Denounce Attacks on Children Seeking Safety in the USFebruary 7, 2022Commentary'Remain in Mexico': Overview and ResourcesRead MoreDaily BriefOct 26, 2022Preventing Intimidation in US Elections; Landmark Declaration on Explosive Weapons; Dam Trouble in Kyrgyzstan; Take Note; Listen: Qatar’s Abuses of LGBT People; Watch: Speaking on Xinjiang at the UN; On Our Terms: Impunity.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
