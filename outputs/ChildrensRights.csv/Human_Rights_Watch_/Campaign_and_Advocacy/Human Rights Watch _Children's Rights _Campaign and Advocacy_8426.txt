Lawmakers in at least 26 other states have introduced athletics bans this year alone, though many are unable to point to any issues arising from transgender students’ participation in sports in their state.These bans are discriminatory and misguided. Narrowly fixated on the idea that a transgender athlete might outperform a cisgender competitor, they preemptively ban transgender young people from participating at all to avoid that scenario.As a result, countless numbers of transgender children are being excluded from the physical and social benefits that athletic competition is intended to provide. For transgender children who are already at risk of bullying and isolation in schools, that exclusion can be particularly cruel and harmful.Worse, these athletic bans are only the tip of the iceberg. A record number of bills have already been filed across the US this year that would prevent transgender kids from accessing gender-affirming healthcare, learning about LGBT issues in schools, and even accessing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. These bills pose serious and well-documented risks to the education, health, privacy, and safety of young transgender people.In the face of divisive and hurtful attacks on transgender kids in schools, adults have an opportunity to model values for young people like inclusivity and respect. Unfortunately, lawmakers in South Dakota have chosen a different path.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights LGBT RightsMore ReadingJanuary 13, 2022News ReleaseUS: Slow Progress on Human RightsNovember 24, 2021DispatchesBiden Administration Confronts US Anti-Trans ViolenceReportsNovember 18, 2021Report“I Just Try to Make It Home Safe”Violence and the Human Rights of Transgender People in the United StatesMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisMore ReadingJanuary 13, 2022News ReleaseUS: Slow Progress on Human RightsNovember 24, 2021DispatchesBiden Administration Confronts US Anti-Trans ViolenceMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
