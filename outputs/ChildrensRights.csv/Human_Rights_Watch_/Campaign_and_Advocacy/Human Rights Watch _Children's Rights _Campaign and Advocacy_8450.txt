It is the law that says that children as young as 14 can marry in New York.There is legislation pending in both houses of the New York State legislature to reform this law and ban all marriage before the age of 17. The new law would allow 17-year-olds to marry only if a judge gives permission – everyone else would have to wait until they are at least 18.Many people are surprised to hear child marriage happens in the United States. They would be even more shocked to hear that in 27 states, there is actually no limit to how early a child can marry if a judge signs off on the marriage.Child marriage – marriage before the age of 18 – is deeply harmful to children who marry and their children. Married children often drop out of school and are locked in poverty as a result. Married girls often quickly become pregnant, which involves serious health risks for pregnant girls and their babies. Girls who marry earlier are at higher risk of domestic violence than women. Married girls often face extra barriers in escaping an abusive or unhappy marriage, and accessing shelter and legal assistance.Countries around the world have committed to end child marriage by 2030, and many are developing plans to meet this goal. Donor countries, including the US, have given funds to help developing countries fight child marriage. The Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Malawi, and Nepal are among the countries that have recently changed their laws in an effort to reduce child marriage.In the US, there are signs of movement as well. Virginia changed its age of marriage in 2016. Legislation to fight child marriage is pending in New Jersey and Maryland, and several other states are likely to put forth similar legislation.Cuomo’s vocal support makes it far more likely that ending child marriage can be a reality in New York. He and the legislators supporting the bill deserve credit for helping to protect New York’s children.Take action and help end child marriage in New York.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights Women's Rights Child MarriageMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseUS: Protect the Right to VoteOctober 26, 2022Q & AQuestions and Answers: US Elections and Human RightsReportsJanuary 20, 2022Report“We Need Access”Ending Preventable Deaths from Cervical Cancer in Rural GeorgiaMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseUS: Protect the Right to VoteOctober 26, 2022Q & AQuestions and Answers: US Elections and Human RightsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
