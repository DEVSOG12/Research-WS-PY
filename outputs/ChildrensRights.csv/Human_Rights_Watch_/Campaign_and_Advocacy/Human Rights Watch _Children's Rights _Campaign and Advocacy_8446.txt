Mothers have to arrange visits and pay for phone calls. Mothers borrow money to pay bail bond fees. Mothers cut food budgets and scrape together rent, while making payments on those fees.But what happens when mom gets held in jail?Sarah Jackson and Daria Morrison were in the car with a friend who committed some robberies.  Neither actively participated, according to later witness testimony, but both were arrested and held with high bail, despite having no prior criminal record. Daria’s family bailed her out, and she was able to fight her case, pleading to a reduced charge and eventual dismissal. Sarah could not afford to bail out. And she had a young son at home. For three months, she stayed in jail, unable to see or care for her child. Her son suffered, missing her touch and the stability of having her at home. She was tormented being away from him. When the prosecutor offered her a time-served deal, she willingly accepted it just to get home to her child, even though it meant pleading guilty to two serious offenses, with lengthy probation, a seven-year suspended prison sentence, and no chance for a dismissal like Daria.When single mothers cannot bail out of jail, children may get sent to foster homes. They may go hungry or miss school or be left in the hands of family members incapable of caring for them. Children suffer trauma seeing a parent behind the glass at jail visiting hours, or walked into a courtroom shackled, in jail uniform. Many mothers do not allow their children to come to court or jail. This spares the child seeing their parent in such circumstances, but also increases the disconnection of the family. Even telephone contact with children while in jail is difficult and expensive.Click to expand ImageIn the week leading up to Mother’s Day, a broad coalition of racial justice groups are calling for a national “Mama’s Bail Out Day,” asking people to help bail mothers out of jail and get them home to their loved ones. The campaign highlights the impact of pretrial detention on black families. Human Rights Watch found, in the six California counties we examined closely, that black people are booked into jail and thus held pretrial at vastly higher rates than people of other races. Human Rights Watch also found that pretrial custody pressures people to plead guilty regardless of actual guilt, just to get out of jail. This pressure is even stronger on a mother trying to get home to her children.This Mother’s Day support “Mama’s Bail Out,” and support bail reform.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal Justice US Poverty and Economic Inequality Racial DiscriminationTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingOctober 5, 2015News ReleaseCalifornia: New Hope for Young OffendersJanuary 27, 2016CommentaryChildren Behind BarsReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingOctober 5, 2015News ReleaseCalifornia: New Hope for Young OffendersJanuary 27, 2016CommentaryChildren Behind BarsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
