In the same vein as alarmist and xenophobic rhetoric and policies seen in Texas, the states claim that giving people a fair shot at protection will cause “calamity ... chaos and catastrophe.” The hyperbole appears designed to conceal abuse and legal misdirection.The real harms are faced by people expelled from the United States, with no chance to explain their situation or seek review.Last week, I spoke to Amelia H. (not her real name) in Juárez, Mexico. She told me that after she entered the United States in September, US border agents stopped her and sent her back to Mexico just before midnight, even though US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) claims it doesn’t expel people after dark. They ordered Amelia to cross despite her pleas to make the trip in the morning. A group of men raped her on her way to a shelter in Mexico that night.This horror was foreseeable and all too common. I’ve interviewed others who endured rape, abduction, or other violence after US border agents expelled them. Human Rights First has documented nearly 10,000 attacks on people summarily expelled.Just last month, border agents expelled a man whose leg had been crushed in a trash compactor in Texas while sleeping in a dumpster to keep warm. He told a reporter, “I ended up getting expelled from El Paso, back over a bridge to Mexico, on foot – even though I had a walker from the hospital, and everyone could see I could barely move.... I was stranded on the street for the rest of the night.” CBP eventually let him back into the US to claim asylum, but only after a nonprofit, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, interceded.If the Biden administration’s plan to end summary expulsions is upheld in the courts, it will go into effect May 23. That’s six more weeks of people facing the same dangers Amelia and thousands of others confronted.It’s hard enough to justify another month and a half of this abusive practice. The claim that the real harms are suffered by US states, rather than the people expelled to danger, is indefensible.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMexico United States ImmigrationTopicChildren's Rights Asylum SeekersMore ReadingMarch 30, 2022DispatchesRestoring Access to Asylum at the US BorderFebruary 10, 2022News ReleaseUS: Deported Cameroonian Asylum Seekers Suffer Serious HarmReportsFebruary 10, 2022Report“How Can You Throw Us Back?”Asylum Seekers Abused in the US and Deported to Harm in CameroonOctober 21, 2021Report“They Treat You Like You Are Worthless”Internal DHS Reports of Abuses by US Border OfficialsMore ReadingMarch 30, 2022DispatchesRestoring Access to Asylum at the US BorderFebruary 10, 2022News ReleaseUS: Deported Cameroonian Asylum Seekers Suffer Serious HarmMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
