New York and North Carolina are the only US states where this is the case.This is neither just nor effective.In fact, trying youth as adults makes communities less safe. Extensive research has shown that youth sent to the adult criminal system face greater violence and few opportunities for education, treatment, and age-appropriate rehabilitation. As a result, they are more likely to commit new crimes than those in the juvenile system.And the ever-evolving field of neuroscience and our understanding of child and adolescent development make it clear that 16- and 17-year-olds do not have the same capacity as adults to understand the implications of their actions. It is essential for the government’s response to their crimes to recognize their development. Saddling a 16-year-old child with an adult criminal record is unfair and counterproductive, making it harder to turn their life around.Those too young to vote, and to legally buy cigarettes or alcohol, should not be prosecuted in adult courts or sent to adult prisons. Human Rights Watch is proud to support Raise the Age New York, a campaign that includes national and local advocates, youth, parents, law enforcement and legal representative groups, faith leaders, and unions that have come together to raise the age of criminal responsibility in New York – and urges legislators in Albany to ensure that an agreement is included in the budget that comprehensively raises the age of criminal responsibility to 18, supporting a more just and effective solution to crime committed by children and adolescents.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal Justice US Poverty and Economic Inequality Racial DiscriminationTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
