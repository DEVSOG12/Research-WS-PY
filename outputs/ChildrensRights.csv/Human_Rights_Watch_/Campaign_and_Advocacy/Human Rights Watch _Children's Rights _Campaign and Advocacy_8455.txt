Under the new law, child offenders sentenced to more than 15 years in prison must have their sentences reviewed. As part of that review the judge must consider the person’s age when the crime was committed, maturity, role in the crime, peer pressure, and potential for rehabilitation in determining whether the original sentence was correct, or if the individual has been sufficiently rehabilitated, and can be released.The Florida legislation was in response to two US Supreme Court cases: Graham v. Florida, which found that juvenile life without parole sentences for non-homicide cases were unconstitutional, and Miller v. Alabama, which found that mandatory juvenile life without parole sentences for any crime were also unconstitutional.Here’s how the Florida Supreme Court built on those decisions: first, it held that Milller applies retroactively. People already in prison serving juvenile life without parole sentences can now benefit from the protections in Miller. The court pointed to a 2014 Florida law, strongly supported by Human Rights Watch, that creates a review structure for children offenders sentenced for serious crimes.Second, the Florida Supreme Court held that the protections of the 2014 law don’t just apply to juvenile life without parole sentences, but also to under-18 offenders sentenced to very long, life-equivalent sentences. (Not all courts have accepted the view that sentences of 60 years and even longer amount to life imprisonment.)Florida has one of the highest populations of inmates sentenced under juvenile life without parole laws. With these decisions, it’s likely that over 200 inmates are now eligible to receive a review of their sentence.Historically, Florida’s policies towards youth in prison have not been ones to emulate. The state still gives prosecutors near-unfettered power to transfer almost 2,000 child offenders to adult court each year, and sentences youth to adult prisons in Florida, whose terrible conditions are well documented. But with last year’s legislative reforms and last week’s Supreme Court rulings, Florida is making strides in protecting the human rights of children in the criminal justice system. This time, Florida got it right.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal JusticeTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
