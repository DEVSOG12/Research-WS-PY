The Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital also became the first hospital in the United States to publicly apologize for the harm these surgeries caused intersex people, who are born with traits that don’t fit conventional expectations of female or male bodies.Convincing surgeons to acknowledge and apologize for the harm of these surgeries and to stop the operations has been the main priority of the US intersex movement since it organized in the early 1990s. This is the first time it has happened at an institutional level. We hope other hospitals and doctors will be inspired by this change and follow suit, and there is some evidence that they are. In October, Boston Children’s Hospital issued a similar pledge to stop certain procedures.An estimated 1.7 percent of the population are intersex, meaning their sex characteristics, such as chromosomes, gonads, or genitals, may differ from social expectations of male and female bodies. These variations are almost invariably medically benign. Yet since the 1960s surgeons in the US have routinely performed cosmetic surgeries on children too young to give consent – some were only two years old.  The surgeries changed children’s bodies to fit a binary definition of male or female.There is no evidence that such operations help children “fit in” or “function in society,” which some surgeons say is their aim. The operations do, however, carry high risks of scarring, loss of sexual sensation, incontinence, sterilization, and psychological trauma.Human Rights Watch published its first report on the consequences of these medically unnecessary surgeries in June of 2017, working closely with consultant Dr. Suegee Tamar-Mattis, who is intersex, a physician, and a parent, as well as with our partner organization, interACT Advocates for Intersex Youth. Along with the report, Human Rights Watch produced a video, featuring a Chicago intersex activist, Pidgeon Pagonis. In October of 2017, we published another report, focusing on the discomfort of US medical providers with the continued use of these surgeries.Since then, Human Rights Watch has called out surgeons for scaring parents of intersex children into wanting the surgeries, and we have presented our findings at medical schools, bar associations, and medical conferences across the US. We also testified at American Medical Association committee meetings and engaged the American Academy of Pediatrics to urge them to pass a nationwide policy.Momentum is growing. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, the Massachusetts Medical Society, and GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality now all have policies supporting a delay of medically unnecessary surgeries until intersex people can consent to the procedures themselves.Human Rights Watch is dedicated to continuing to document and advocate against these harmful surgeries, helping intersex children grow up healthy and whole.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights Intersex Children LGBT RightsMore ReadingJuly 30, 2020DispatchesFirst US Hospital Pledges to End Intersex SurgeriesDecember 13, 2019DispatchesMassachusetts Medical Society Supports Intersex RightsReportsNovember 18, 2021Report“I Just Try to Make It Home Safe”Violence and the Human Rights of Transgender People in the United StatesMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisMore ReadingJuly 30, 2020DispatchesFirst US Hospital Pledges to End Intersex SurgeriesDecember 13, 2019DispatchesMassachusetts Medical Society Supports Intersex RightsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
