Any parent could sue their child’s school for compensation for alleged harm if they believe those discussions have occurred. The likely outcome of the bill would be to deter teachers from addressing these issues and to chill open discussions and support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students.The bill would also require school personnel to notify parents of changes in a student’s physical, mental, or emotional health. It would significantly limit the ability of counselors and teachers to be a confidential resource for students, including LGBT students who may not feel safe or comfortable asking questions about sexual orientation or gender identity to family members.Human Rights Watch has documented how curricular restrictions harm LGBT youth in US schools. These restrictions not only prevent students from accessing information that’s essential to their health and well-being, but send a discriminatory message that being LGBT is inappropriate or wrong. That message not only stigmatizes LGBT children but can tacitly encourage intolerance and bullying from peers from a young age.In recent years, states like Alabama, Arizona, South Carolina, and Utah all repealed laws that limited discussions of LGBT issues in schools. Similar laws remain in place in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Texas, while five other states allow parents to opt their children out of curricula in which LGBT issues are being discussed.By introducing new laws to this effect, Florida is moving in the wrong direction – and at least seven other states are poised to do so as well. Teachers should not fear punishment if they celebrate diversity or let kids know that it’s okay to be LGBT, and students should not be cut off from affirming information and support.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights Education LGBT RightsMore ReadingFebruary 8, 2022DispatchesSouth Dakota Embraces Attacks on Transgender KidsJuly 21, 2021CommentaryLawmakers Are Harming LGBTQ+ YouthReportsAugust 8, 2022ReportRacial Discrimination in the United StatesHuman Rights Watch / ACLU Joint Submission Regarding the United States’ Record Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial DiscriminationNovember 18, 2021Report“I Just Try to Make It Home Safe”Violence and the Human Rights of Transgender People in the United StatesMore ReadingFebruary 8, 2022DispatchesSouth Dakota Embraces Attacks on Transgender KidsJuly 21, 2021CommentaryLawmakers Are Harming LGBTQ+ YouthMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
