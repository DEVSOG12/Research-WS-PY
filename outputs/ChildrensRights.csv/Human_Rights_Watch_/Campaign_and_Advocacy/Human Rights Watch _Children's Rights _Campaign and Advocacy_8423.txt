The investigation could help document troubling and persistent inequities and recommend measures to remedy them.A group of impacted parents and advocates spoke to the New York Advisory Committee to the US Commission on Civil Rights and described how Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, especially those living in poverty, are disproportionately investigated for allegations of maltreatment by the state’s child welfare system, causing serious harm, including at times the forcible separation of children from their families. Joyce McMillan, an impacted parent and founder of JMacForFamilies, spoke to the committee about the systemic “breaking of family bonds” and “loss of culture, and loss of family tradition” caused by “forcible family separation.”At the meeting, I submitted a public comment on behalf of Human Rights Watch in support of the proposal. I described our research over the last eight months on the child welfare system, both nationally and in New York.Our research has involved interviews with dozens of directly impacted caregivers, along with advocates and other experts. It also includes extensive data analysis and reviews of secondary sources. We identified serious human rights concerns in the child welfare system.Nearly every three minutes, a child in New York State experiences a child welfare investigation. Our research shows investigations can be highly stressful and even traumatic for children, involving disruptions from school, intrusive questioning, and even strip searches to check for signs of abuse. Seventy percent of those investigated are found not to have experienced maltreatment at home.Removing a child from their parents’ care, even for a short period of time, is a drastic measure that can cause profound harm. The New York State Bar Association recently found the state’s child welfare system to be “replete with systemic racism.” In 2019, Black children made up 15 percent of New York’s child population but more than 40 percent of children in the state’s foster system, which places children separated from their families in temporary homes.Angela Burton, one of the advocates who spoke out in support of the investigation, told the committee: “There must be a public accounting and reckoning of how current government policies, processes, and practices disrupt and destroy intact, viable Black families.” Today’s vote in favor of an investigation means that public reckoning will begin.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's RightsMore ReadingApril 9, 2022DispatchesAsylum Seekers Face Real Harm from US Border PolicyMarch 31, 2022News ReleaseUS: Congress Should Protect Child FarmworkersReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingApril 9, 2022DispatchesAsylum Seekers Face Real Harm from US Border PolicyMarch 31, 2022News ReleaseUS: Congress Should Protect Child FarmworkersMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
