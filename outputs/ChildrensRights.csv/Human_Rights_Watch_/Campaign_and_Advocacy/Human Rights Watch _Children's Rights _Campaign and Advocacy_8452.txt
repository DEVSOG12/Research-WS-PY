But South Sudan – which only gained its independence in 2011 – acceded in January, and today, Somalia – which for many years had no recognized government – completed its ratification process. This afternoon, Somalia’s prime minister deposited his country’s instrument of ratification at the UN headquarters in New York.Click to expand ImageVeronica Limia leaves the Florida Institute for Girls on October 11, 2001.

It establishes the rights that every parent wants for their child – the right to an education, to health, to a name and nationality, and to freedom from violence, discrimination, and exploitation. These rights should not be controversial. Unfortunately, some groups in the US have claimed that by affirming the rights of children, ratification of the convention would undermine the rights of parents.This simply wouldn’t be the case. The convention repeatedly emphasizes the importance of parents in raising and guiding their children and specifically obliges countries to recognize the responsibilities and duties of parents.The US signed the treaty two decades ago, in 1995, but no serious effort has been made in recent years to get the necessary approval of two-thirds of the Senate.The main legal challenge for US ratification is that it remains the only country to sentence children to life in prison without the possibility of parole – a punishment the treaty specifically prohibits. The US Supreme Court has issued several decisions in recent years that have progressively narrowed the use of this sentence against child offenders, and states should prohibit it completely. The US should ratify the treaty and declare that it is working to end the practice in the states that allow it.Americans care for the well-being of children as much as anyone else. The White House and Congress should do what every other country in the world has now done – commit under international law to ensure that children can grow, develop, and enjoy all their rights.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAfrica Somalia South Sudan United States US Foreign PolicyTopicChildren's RightsMore ReadingOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersOctober 7, 2022StatementBenin: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against WomenReportsDecember 16, 2021Report“They Are Destroying Our Future”Armed Separatist Attacks on Students, Teachers, and Schools in Cameroon’s Anglophone RegionsMay 26, 2021Report“I Must Work to Eat”Covid-19, Poverty, and Child Labor in Ghana, Nepal, and UgandaMore ReadingOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersOctober 7, 2022StatementBenin: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against WomenMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
