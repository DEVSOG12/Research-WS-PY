They suffer targeted attacks on their schools and teachers or languish in institutions or detention centers, where they endure inhumane conditions and assaults on their dignity. Young and immature, they are often easily exploited. In many cases, they are abused by the very individuals responsible for their care. We are working to help protect children around the world, so they can grow into adults.@2010 David Høgsholt/Reportage by Getty Images for Human Rights WatchGlobalApril 9, 2020News ReleaseCOVID-19’s Devastating Impact on ChildrenGlobalJune 15, 2020News ReleaseUN Chief’s ‘List of Shame’ Drops Saudi-Led CoalitionEurope/Central AsiaOctober 22, 2022CommentaryTwo Years On, Poland’s Abortion Crackdowns and the Rule of LawLetta TaylerAssociate Director, Crisis and Conflict DivisionPublished in:openDemocracyVideosWatch moreVideosChildren Tracked While Learning"You Don't Feel Like a Person."Cameroon: School AttacksReportsMore reportsSeptember 8, 2022Report“It Was Really Hard to Protect Myself”Impact of the Armed Conflict in Syria on Children with DisabilitiesSeptember 6, 2022ReportAfghanistan: ISIS Group Targets Religious MinoritiesTaliban Need to Protect, Assist Hazara, Other At-Risk CommunitiesSeptember 5, 2022ReportChina: New Evidence of Mass DNA Collection in TibetRural Areas, Children Targeted for Intrusive PolicingAugust 30, 2022ReportAcross Africa, Many Young Mothers Face Education BarriersAfrican Union Guidance, Policy Reforms Needed to Ensure Girls Continue EducationNewsOctober 22, 2022CommentaryTwo Years On, Poland’s Abortion Crackdowns and the Rule of LawOctober 19, 2022DispatchesAll Children Have a Right to Pre-Primary EducationUN Education Expert Recommends New Education TreatyOctober 14, 2022StatementGuatemala: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-SessionOctober 14, 2022DispatchesHonduras Should Commit to Protecting Women’s and Girls’ RightsUN Women’s Rights Body Will Review Honduras’ Record on Sexual and Reproductive Rights, Non-DiscriminationOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersBut 4 Countries Recruiting Children Will Still Receive US Military AidOctober 7, 2022StatementBenin: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-sessionOctober 3, 2022StatementThailand: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-sessionOctober 3, 2022DispatchesNigeria Agrees to End Military Detention of ChildrenPledges Swift Reintegration Support for Boko Haram SuspectsOctober 3, 2022DispatchesKyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Conflict Leaves Children without EducationBoth Countries Should Endorse Safe Schools DeclarationSeptember 21, 2022StatementArmenia: Submissionto the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women83rd SessionSeptember 20, 2022StatementJapan: Submission to the UN Human Rights Committee136th sessionSeptember 20, 2022StatementHonduras: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women83rd SessionRead MoreOur peopleZama NeffExecutive Director, Children’s Rights DivisionJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionBede SheppardDeputy Director, Children's Rights DivisionJuliane KippenbergAssociate Director, Children's Rights DivisionMichael Garcia BochenekSenior Counsel, Children’s Rights DivisionElizabeth CalvinSenior Advocate, Children's Rights DivisionBill Van EsveldAssociate Director, MENA, Children's Rights DivisionMargaret WurthSenior Researcher, Children's Rights DivisionElin MartínezSenior Researcher, Children's Rights DivisionHye Jung HanResearcher and Advocate, Children's Rights DivisionAmanda LeavellResearcher and Advocate, Children's Rights DivisionHina NaveedAryeh Neier Fellow, Children's Rights DivisionWilliam HoffmannCoordinator, Children's Rights DivisionKatherine La PuenteAssociate, Children's Rights DivisionSutina GreenLife Without Parole (LWOP) Project ManagerJoya FadelAssociate, Children's Rights DivisionA Brighter FutureEmpowering pregnant girls and adolescent mothers to stay in school.A Human Rights Watch indexDaily BriefOct 26, 2022Preventing Intimidation in US Elections; Landmark Declaration on Explosive Weapons; Dam Trouble in Kyrgyzstan; Take Note; Listen: Qatar’s Abuses of LGBT People; Watch: Speaking on Xinjiang at the UN; On Our Terms: Impunity.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
