Syrian governmentarmed forces have been primarily responsible for these violations. But armedgroups fighting the government have also committed many serious abuses—includingrecruiting and using children under 18 in combat and in direct support roles.Human Rights Watch first documented this practice inNovember 2012, finding that boys as young as 14 assisted in support roles forthe “Free Syrian Army,” an umbrella term for multiple armed groups fightingagainst Syrian government troops. Since then, the number of armed groups inSyria has proliferated to include extremist Islamist groups such as Jabhatal-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) that, local residentsand former child fighters say, have systematically sought to recruit children.This report documents the experiences of 25 children who arecurrent or former members of opposition armed groups. It does not, forlogistical and security reasons, cover all groups thatreportedlyuse children in Syria, in particular children who reported supporting, orparticipating with, government troops or pro-government militias, althoughseveral credible sources indicate that children have done so.Human Rights Watch found that opposition armed groups usedboys as young as 15 as fighters and children as young as 14 in support roles. Somechildren who participated were detained or killed in battle. Boys interviewed foughton the frontlines, spied on hostile forces, acted as snipers, treated thewounded on battlefields, and ferried ammunition and other supplies to battles whilefighting raged. One doctor described treating a boy between 10 and 12 years oldwhose job it was to whip prisoners held in an ISIS detention facility,according to the adult fighter who brought him.The number of children who have taken part in Syria’sarmed conflict is not known.However, by May 2014, the ViolationsDocumenting Center, a Syrian monitoring group, had documented 194“non-civilian” male children killed since September 2011.The use of children by opposition armed groups has not beenconfined to one group, or to certain ideologies or ethnicities. Childreninterviewed by Human Rights Watch reported serving in brigades and battalions associatedwith the Free Syrian Army (FSA), extremist Islamist forces such as the Jabhatal-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS), and YekîneyênParastina Gel (YPG) military and Asayish police forces inKurdish-controlled parts of northern Syria.Boys have joined armed opposition groups for variousreasons. Many simply followed their relatives or friends. Others lived inbattle zones without open schools, participated in public protests, or had personallysuffered at the hands of the government. Islamist groups such as ISIS have moreaggressively targeted children for recruitment, providing free lectures and schoolingthat included weapons and other military training.“At first I was so scared…then I got used toit,” said Ayman, who began fighting with an FSA brigade in Salqin when hewas 15 years old. Others interviewed echoed his words. Few had plans or realhopes for their future beyond the next battle. “Maybe we’ll live,and maybe we’ll die,” said Omar, who began fighting at age 14 withJabhat al-Nusra.International humanitarian law (the laws of war) and internationalhuman rights law ban government forces and non-state armed groups from recruitingand using children as fighters and in other support roles. The OptionalProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Syria ratified in2003, bans non-state armies from recruiting or using children under age 18 indirect hostilities. Conscripting or enlisting children under 15, including forsupport roles, is a war crime under the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court.Several of the children interviewed said they fought withtwo or three different armed groups fighting Syrian government forces. Some—likeAmr who said he received US$100 a month—received monthly salaries of upto $135, while others said they participated without pay. Many attendedtraining camps where they learned military tactics and had weapons training.Children who wished to leave armed groups and resume acivilian life told Human Rights Watch they had few options to do so. Saleh, 17,said he fought with the Free Syrian Army at 15 after he was detained and torturedby government security forces. He later joined Ahrar al-Sham, then left to jointhe Jund al-Aqsa, an independent Islamist armed group. “I thought ofleaving [the fighting] a lot,” he said. “I lost my studies, I lostmy future, I lost everything. I looked for work, but there’s no work.This is the most difficult period for me.”All of the armed groups have taken insufficient measures toprevent children from joining their ranks, not asking or verifying throughdocuments children’s real ages when they joined, or failing to turnchildren away. Three commanders of various FSA units told Human Rights Watchthat their units did not accept children under 18 as a matter of officialpolicy, but did not turn them away when they came to them eager to fight. “16,17 is not young. [If we don’t take him,] he’ll go fight on hisown,” Abu Rida, leader of the Saif Allah al-Maslool brigade, an FSA groupin Daraa, said.Some armed groups told Human Rights Watch that they prohibitchild recruitment, or have taken preliminary steps to end the practice. InMarch 2014, the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and OppositionForces, a coalition of opposition groups supported by the Free Syrian Army, announcedthat it had implemented “new training for Free Syrian Army members inInternational Humanitarian Law to eliminate the recruitment and participationof children in armed conflict.” In December 2013, the YPG General Commandissued an order prohibiting enlistment of children under age 18. In January, aYPG spokesperson told Human Rights Watch that the force had demobilized fightersunder 18, though researchers met child fighters after his statement. Much moreshould be done to stop child soldiers from joining or continuing to fight withthese groups, and the others mentioned in this report.If they have not already done so, armed groups operating inSyria should publicly commit to end recruitment and use of children under age18, and should demobilize all fighters or others under 18 currently in theirranks. Those recruited under age 18 but now no longer children should be freeto leave opposition forces. Armed groups should also work with internationalagencies specialized in child protection to rehabilitate and reintegrate thesechildren into civilian life. Finally, they should ensure that all officersunder their command understand the ban on recruiting or seeking assistance fromchildren, and establish age-verification procedures they must follow to enforceit. Officers responsible for recruitment who continue to enlist children shouldbe appropriately disciplined.To address the practice of children joining armed groups inSyria, UN bodies should seek public commitments from armed groups not torecruit or enlist children under age 18 and use age-verification procedures toensure that children do not join. The UN Security Council should refer thesituation in Syria to the International Criminal Court to allow prosecution ofwar crimes, including the conscriptingor enlisting of children under 15 into armed forces or non-state armed groupsor their active participation in hostilities.Governments providing aid toarmed groups in Syria should review these groups’ policies on child recruitment, and should suspend all military salesand assistance, including technical training and services, to all forcescredibly implicated in the widespread or systematic commission of seriousabuses, including the use of child soldiers, until they stop committingthese crimes and take appropriate disciplinary action against perpetrators.They should also restrict residentsof their countries from providing militarysupport to these groups.Finally, humanitarian agencies operating in Syria orassisting refugees in neighboring countries should support efforts to providesecondary education opportunities for children, and address the particularneeds and vulnerabilities of boys aged 13 to 18 in their child protection programming.RecommendationsTo All Armed GroupsFighting in SyriaImmediately cease the recruitment, enlistment, and use ofchildren under 18 as fighters or in military support roles. Implement age-verificationprocedures during recruitment by at a minimum:Checking documents including identification cards or documents,school diplomas, or medical records; and/orChecking with family members or community members, toensure that children under 18 do not continue to enlist.Do not recruit or enlist any individual whose age is indoubt and cannot be confirmed as over 18.Make public commitments prohibiting the use of children under18 as either fighters or in military support roles in violation ofinternational law, and ensure these commitments are communicated to allmembers of the armed group.Review the ages of members currently enlisted orsupporting troops using age-verification procedures, and demobilize anyfighters under 18.Permit fighters who joined under age 18 but arecurrently adults to freely resign.Adopt and implement disciplinary measures against memberswho recruit children for combatant or military support roles.Facilitatechildren under 18 rehabilitating and reintegrating into civilian society, incoordination with international agencies and local groups that specialize in, orwork on, child protection. Provide public updates onhow many children have been demobilize from their respective forces and what ishappening with those children.Ceasecooperating and coordinating with groups that are credibly found tosystematically use child soldiers.To Jabhat al-Nusra andthe Islamic State of Iraq and ShamCease deliberately recruiting children, in particular throughweapons training and other military training in school environments.Prohibit recruitment campaigns in schools, educational environments, orother locations likely to attract children.To Governments Providing Assistance to Armed Groupsin SyriaReview groups’ regulations onuse of children and seek public commitments to end the recruitment and useof anyone under 18.Suspend all military sales andassistance, including technical training and services, to all national forcesand non-state armed groups credibly implicated in the widespread orsystematic commission of serious abuses in Syria, including the use ofchild soldiers, until such time as they stop committing these crimes and perpetratorsare appropriately disciplined.Inaccordance with domestic law and due process, restrict money transfers andother support from residents to groups credibly implicated in the widespreador systematic commission of serious abuses, including use of childsoldiers.Forcountries on Syria’s borders, adopt measures to restrict entry offighters and arm flows to groups credibly implicated in the widespread orsystematic commission of serious abuses, including the use of childsoldiers.Callon the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the InternationalCriminal Court, as the forum most capable of effectively investigating andprosecuting those bearing the greatest responsibility for abuses in Syria.To the UN Security CouncilReferthe situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court as a first steptoward ensuring accountability for serious crimes committed in Syria,including the practice of “conscripting or enlistingchildren under the age of 15 into armed forces or groups or usingthem to participate actively in hostilities.”Requirestates to suspend all military sales and assistance, including technicaltraining and services, to all national forces and non-state armed groups crediblyimplicated in the widespread or systematic commission of serious abuses,including use of child soldiers, until such time as they stop committingthese crimes and perpetrators are appropriately disciplined.To the UN SecurityCouncil Working Group on Children and Armed ConflictAuthorizethespecialrepresentativeof thesecretary-generalfor children and armedconflict to transmit information on grave violations against children in thearmed conflict in Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court underarticle 15 of the Rome Statute.To the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed ConflictEngagewith armed groups in Syria to secure commitments to end the recruitment and useof child soldiers.To the UN Country Team for SyriaAdvocatewith armed groups mentioned in the secretary-general’s annual report onchildren in armed conflict and negotiate action plans to end their use of childsoldiers.Investigate recruitment and use of children by armed groups andadvocate with them to end abuses.To International HumanitarianAgencies Working in Syria and with Syrian RefugeesSupportefforts to provide secondary education opportunities for children, to reducethe drop-out rate from secondary education, and to address through childprotection programming the particular vulnerability of boys aged13 to 18, whoarmed groups may target for recruitment.MethodologyThis report is based on interviews with 25 children who werecurrent or former fighters or otherwise assisted opposition armed groups inSyria, as well as six adult fighters and 4 military commanders. Human RightsWatch conducted in-person interviews in Jordan, eastern Turkey, Iraqi Kurdistan,and in the Idlib governorate and Kurdish-controlled areas of Hasakehgovernorate in Syria.Researchers located child interviewees in hospitals andmedical clinics, including medical clinics primarily serving particular armedgroups; in public gathering places frequented by Syrian refugees; and in theZaatari refugee camp in Jordan. We met additional interviewees through Syrianactivists concerned with child recruitment by non-state armed groups.In addition, researchersinterviewed four family members of child soldiers, four medical andpsychosocial service providers who treated child fighters in Turkey or Syria,and 14 people who witnessed boys or girls (in Kurdish areas)theyidentified as under 18 manning checkpoints. These witnesses included bothSyrians and international humanitarian workers.Researchers conducted interviews primarily in Arabic, orwith the help of an Arabic translator. Interviews with a small number of nativeEnglish speakers were conducted in English. Where interviewees preferred tospeak in Kurdish, interviews were conducted with the help of a Kurdishtranslator. Researchers asked interviewees for their names but did not requirethem to provide full names.We used pseudonyms for all child interviewees named in thisreport for their own protection, even when interviewees stated that the reportcould include their real names. Researchers did notpay interviewees or offer any form of compensation for their testimony; in afew cases, travel costs to the interview location were reimbursed.In this report,“child” and “children” are used to refer to anyoneunder the age of 18, consistent with usage under international law.BackgroundSince late 2011, non-state armed groups in Syria haverecruited and enlisted children under age 18 and deployed them in combat andfor other purposes.[1] HumanRights Watch first documented this practice in November 2012, finding that boysas young as 14 assisted in support roles for the “Free Syrian Army,”a general term for various armed groups opposed to the Syrian government. Childrenas young as 16 served as fighters and took part in combat operations.[2]Children interviewed at that time said they joined armed groups along with malerelatives, friends, or other members of their community.[3]Since then, the number of armed groups in Syria hasproliferated. The Free Syrian Army has waned in influence as regional groupshave gained power and foreign funding. Anti-government armed groups have cometogether in a variety of alliances to combat government advances and to fightthe Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS). Extremist Islamist groups Jabhatal-Nusra and ISIS have gained control over territory and expanded theirpresence in the country.Residents of areas controlled by ISIS or Jabhatal-Nusra say these groups have reached out to young people, including children,in systematic ways, entering schools and providing education in mosques thatincludes weapons and military training.[4] Childfighters and witnesses have confirmed their accounts.Children told Human Rights Watch they fought with members ofthe following armed groups in Syria:Free Syrian Army(FSA): The FSA was formed inAugust 2011 by Syrian army defectors based in Turkey. In December 2012, anumber of groups calling themselves members of the Free Syrian Army alignedunder the Supreme Military Council, with Gen. Salim Idris serving as itschief-of-staff. The Supreme Military Council, led since February 16, 2014 byAbdullah al-Bashir, remains a loose coalition of brigades based around thecountry, and lacks a strong central command structure.[5]Experts have described the FSA as an umbrella term encompassing a range ofnon-state armed groups fighting against government forces, rather than adefined military unit.[6] FSAbrigades have fought primarily against government troops, but have also fought againstextremist Islamist groups including ISIS.Islamic Front:In November 2013, seven Islamist groups includingHarakat Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiya (Ahrar al-Sham) and Liwa’ al-Tawhid,both noted below, announced that they were forming an alliance.[7]Combined, the groups represented an estimated45,000 fighters.[8]Harakat Ahrar al-Shamal-Islamiya (Ahrar al-Sham): A Salafist group that first emerged in thenorthwestern province of Idlib in late 2011 as Ahrar al-Sham. It later mergedwith three other Islamist groups to form Harakat Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiyya.Its leader is Hassan Abboud, also known as Abu Abdullah al-Hamawi.[9]It consists of an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 fighters.[10]Liwa al-Tawhid: Liwaat-Tawhid was formed in July 2012 from several armed groups operating in thenorthern Aleppo countryside. Liwa al-Tawhid is considered one of the mainforces operating in Aleppo province.[11] AbdulAziz Salama serves as the group’s political leader; former militarycommander Abdul Qader Saleh was killed in an airstrike along with several otherTawhid leaders in November 2013.[12] Thegroup contains an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 fighters.[13]Jabhat al-Nusra: An extremist Islamist group that declaredits existence in January 2012.[14] AbuMohammed al-Jolani leads the group, which contains an estimated 5,000 to 7,000fighters.[15] In 2013, al-Jolani affirmed thegroup’s allegiance to Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Jabhat al-Nusrahas brigades in several Syrian provinces including Idlib, Aleppo, and Daraa.[16]IslamicState of Iraq and Sham (ISIS): An extremist Islamist group that is activein both Iraq and Syria. ISIS announced the inclusion of the Sham, or Levant(referring to a group of countries including Syria in the easternMediterranean), in its name in April 2013 to reflect its participation in theSyrian conflict.[17] InFebruary 2014, Al-Qaeda renounced any ties with ISIS, which had at one timebeen an affiliate.[18] ISIS isprimarily active in Syria’s northern provinces and has controlled Raqqacity as well as parts of Raqqa governorate since May 2013.[19]The group is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000fighters. ISIS fighters have battled with other anti-government groupsincluding Jabhat al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, and FSA brigades in northern Syria.[20]YekîneyênParastina Gel (YPG) military andAsayish police forces: Respectively,the military wing and police forces of the Syrian Kurdish political party,the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), supported by the Turkish Kurdish movement thePartiya Karkarane Kurdistan (PKK).[21] The PYD exercises de facto control over three predominatelyKurdish areas in northern Syria: Ain al-`Arab, `Afrin, and Jazira. In 2012, theSyrian government and its security forces largely withdrew from these areas,apparently not wanting to open hostilities with the Kurds.[22] The PYD, the strongest and most organized Kurdishpolitical party in the area, its armed wing and police force, promptly filled the void with little to nostate resistance. Estimates on the number ofYPG and Asayish fighters vary; YPG fighters reportedly number between 10,000 and30,000; the Asayish include an estimated 20,000 police officers.[23]Since mid-2013, they have clashed with extremist Islamist forces, in particularISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, in areas under their control.[24]Recruitment and Use of ChildrenAn unknown number of children have joined armed groupsfighting in the Syrian armed conflict, either as combatants or to otherwiseprovide support.The documentation groups on Syria have not collecteddata on the numbers of children involved. However, as of June 2014, theViolations Documenting Center, a Syrian monitoring group, had documented 194cases of “non-civilian” male children killed in the fighting sinceSeptember 2011.[25]Human Rights Watch interviewed 25 children who fought withor assisted armed groups in Syria. Children interviewed fought with the FreeSyrian Army (FSA); Ahrar al-Sham; Jabhat al-Nusra; the Islamic State of Iraqand Sham (ISIS); and the Yekîneyên Parastina Gel(YPG) as well as the Asayish (Kurdish Peoples’ Defense Forces and policeforce). Two children under 15 described providing support to FSAbrigades, and there were credible reports that Ahrar al-Sham, Jabhat al-Nusra,and ISIS used children under 15 in combat or support roles.Children told Human Rights Watch that they took up arms fora variety of reasons: after government security forces detained and torturedthem; after participating in political protests; alongside male family membersor with friends; after their schools closed or they were expelled for politicalreasons; and simply because they had a desire to go to battle.In some cases, anti-government armed groups recruited andenlisted children from refugee camps and communities in neighboring countries,as well as inside Syria itself.[26] A17-year-old boy said he returned to Syria to fight at age 16 after attendingsermons encouraging attendees at mosques and public speeches in Tripoli,Lebanon, to go for jihad in Syria.[27]Humanitarian assistance agencies and Syrians responsible foroverseeing the return of Syrians from Jordan’s Zaatari refugee camp backto Syria described how any child who wished to return to Syria alone had toappear with his parents before the head of the camp (an official inJordan’s Interior Ministry) to describe his reasons and get approval forthe return journey. This process, they said, had significantly diminished thenumber of children returning alone to Syria, including those returning tofight. Human Rights Watch did not meet children who said they had immediateplans to return and join armed groups in Syria. Children interviewed in Turkey saidthey had joined armed groups inside Syria and left for brief periods, ratherthan being recruited in Turkey.The March 2014 report of the UN Independent Commission ofInquiry on Syria found that pro-government armed groups also recruited and usedchildren, stating that “pro-government militia armed and used childrenfrom the age of 13 at checkpoints in Aleppo, Dara’a, and Tartus. InOctober 2013, in Ataman (Dara’a), children from the age of 14 were armedand trained by popular committees.”[28]HumanRights Watch could not corroborate this information because for securityreasons and access limitations we did not conduct research in areas or amongpopulations who were likely to participate in pro-government armed groups. An18 year old said that when he was 16, government security officers attempted torecruit him to inform on his classmates at school, but that he refused.[29]Islamic Front BattalionsHarakat Ahrar al-Shamal-IslamiyaHuman Rights Watch interviewed seven children who foughtwith Ahrar al-Sham in Syria as early as January 2013, when the group wasformed. All seven had combat roles; the youngest said he joined when he was 15.Several joined Ahrar al-Sham battalions after serving ortraining with other armed groups; others joined with a friend or family member.It is not clear whether Ahrar al-Sham actively targeted children forrecruitment. Some said that leaders did not verify their ages before theyjoined, while others said commanders allowed them to join despite their youngage.Children attended military training camps with adults,participated in battles, fought on front lines, and received salaries ofbetween SYL 7,000 and 15,000 (US$47 to $101) a month.[30]One interviewee said he received a monthly box from his brigade, along with hissalary, that contained food supplies including oil, canned goods, and grains.[31]Riad, 17, said he joinedthe Abu Talha al-Ansari brigade of Ahrar al-Sham at age 16, after attending anAhrar training camp.[32]After participating in anti-governmentdemonstrations, he left school and fled to Lebanon for a period to avoidarrest. When he returned, he spent 15 days training with Ahrar al-Sham in late 2013.At the training camp, at a former agricultural institute in Harim, northernSyria, he said he studied Sharia (Islamic law) and Islamic studies as well aslearning battle tactics and how to use weapons.After training, he foughtin battles at Jabal Turkman, in Latakia governorate, and in the Aleppocountryside, near the town of al-Aziza. Riad told Human Rights Watch that hehad the same duties as adult fighters in his brigade.[33]Hassan, 17, said in late2013, when he was 16, he spent a month training at an Ahrar al-Sham camp in theSarmada mountains, in Idlib governorate.[34]He entered the training camp after volunteeringto participate in a battle with Ahrar al-Sham fighters in the Raqqa governorate.Of the 100 fighters in the camp, he said, five or six were under 18. At thecamp, he said, his daily schedule included praying, religious instruction, andmilitary tactics instruction, as well as weapons training. During training, healso performed guard duty at the camp.[35]Ayman, who joined Ahrar al-Sham at age 17, told Human RightsWatch that children under 15 assisted Ahrar al-Sham by bringing them supplies,including during a battle he participated in at Rashideen, a district in Aleppo.[36]“[They] would bring us food and ammunition because there were snipers andso we could not cross. But [the snipers] wouldn’t shoot children,”he said.[37]Tawhid BrigadeHuman Rights Watch interviewed a psychological counselor whocounseled three children, aged 13-15 after they fled to Turkey, all of whom shesaid fought with the Tawhid Brigade in Aleppo.[38] Thecounselor said that one of the children, a 15 year old, had joined because his “financialsituation was very hard,” and that “his dad was dead and he had nofamily to take care of him.” Another of the children, 13, was shelledwhile at a Tawhid base. “He had to have his leg amputated,” thecounselor said. The 14 year old joined after government forces arrested andkilled his father, and had been injured five months earlier in battle. “Hetold me he learned how to snipe and shoot a [machine gun],” the counselorsaid.[39]Human Rights Watch also interviewed two boys who fought withthe Tawhid brigade: one joined in Idlib at age 17, and the other in Aleppo,also at age 17.[40]Free Syrian Army (FSA)In November 2012, HumanRights Watch documented children as young as 14 serving in support roles andthose as young as 16 in combatant roles with Daraa and Homs-based brigades affiliatedwith the Free Syrian Army.[41]Research conducted for this report showsthat in 2013 and 2014, children continued to serve as both combatants and insupport roles for units that claimed allegiance to the Free Syrian Army. Theyoungest FSA supporters interviewed participated at 14, and the youngestcombatants interviewed joined at 15.[42]Children told Human Rights Watch that they joined or supportedFree Syrian Army brigades in Daraa, Damascus countryside, Aleppo, and Idlibgovernorates. Many did so because they had immediate or extended familymembers, friends, or community members with the unit.Others joinedwithout such personal connections.Two 14-year-olds said they supported FSA brigades operatingin Jarablus, Aleppo governorate, by carrying supplies, loading ammunition, andinforming on enemy troop movements.[43]Ahmed,14, said he helped an FSA brigade in Jarablus, which included many of hisrelatives, by bringing them food and weapons.[44] Mahmoud,14, told Human Rights Watch that he informed the FSA brigade in his hometown ofJarablus about ISIS movements, and that ISIS captured and severely beat him fordoing so.[45] Theunit he supported included his family members and friends.Human Rights Watch interviewed 15 boys and young men whojoined FSA brigades in Daraa, Damascus countryside, and Aleppo governorates whileunder 18. Some reported more protective treatment because of their age: theysaid commanders assigned them different duties than adults or prevented themfrom going to battles.[46] Othershad the same duties as adult soldiers and fought on the front lines.[47]Three commanders of various FSA units told Human RightsWatch that their units did not accept children under 18 as a matter of officialpolicy.[48] However, they added that when childrenunder 18 came to them eager to fight, they did not turn them away.[49]Abu Rida, leader of the Saif Allah al-Maslool brigade, anFSA group, in Daraa, told Human Rights Watch:If a boy is hardheaded or stubborn, if he lost someone, we’ll keep themin the camp. But 16, 17 is not young. [If we don’t take him,] he’llgo fight on his own. In clashes they’ll be in the second or third row, ordoing first aid, driving, loading ammunition for people who attack.[50]Mohsin, 20, commander of a small group of FSA fighters inJarablus, said:When we formed our brigade, we didn’t differentiatebetween strong and weak youth—we just looked for revolutionary works. Wewould accept them whatever the age.[51]Saleh, 17, said that he joined the Idlib Martyrs’Battalion, an FSA group, when he was 15. He told the commanders that he was 20years old, and said that no one asked for proof of his age.[52]He did not receive formal training, but fought in several battles, including abattle to free Harem, a town in Idlib. He stayed with the brigade for sevenmonths, leaving when he was 16 to join Ahrar al-Sham.[53]Hassan, 17, said he joinedthe Asad Allah Hamza battalion, an FSA group headed by his sister’s husband,when he was 15.[54]“Atfirst they prevented me from joining battles because I’m young,” hesaid. “I tried for one month to go to battles with them and they didn'tagree. [But] after that, they let me go with them.” Hassan said that hefought his first battle in Harem, in Idlib governorate. He carried aKalashnikov [assault rifle] and the battle lasted for five days. After thebattle, his brigade assigned him to guard a checkpoint at night.[55]Fouad, 18, said he joined the Ahfad al-Rasul battalion, an FSAgroup, in Eastern Ghouta, in Damascus countryside, when he was 17 years old.[56]He stayed with his unit for only a month and a half, and provided first aid towounded fighters. He did not receive weapons training, he said. He said that thebrigade assigned combat duties to defectors from the government army, which is whythey did not provide him with combat training or duties.[57]Massoud, 19, a young Kurdish man from Aleppo, said he joinedan FSA unit of Kurdish fighters from his neighborhood in Aleppo city when hewas 17.[58]“I was a sniper and I participated in battles,” he said. “Iparticipated in the liberation of Midan al-Ashrafiyeh, Sheikh Mansour, andBustan Basha. I was on the front line.” Massoud left Syria to receivemedical treatment for a serious leg injury he sustained in battle.[59]Samir, 19, told Human Rights Watch that he joined an FSAbrigade at 17 after he was arrested and tortured by Syrian government securityforces: “After I was released, a month or two later I decided to take uparms. One of my friends was in the FSA. I told him I wanted to join andparticipate in battles.”[60] Samirattended two separate military training camps and participated in combat.“My role was to attack checkpoints with other fighters,” he said.“I was on the frontline, and I used a Kalashnikov…I [also] used toguard checkpoints at night and check IDs.”[61]Eyad, 15, said he joined the Hanano brigade, an FSA group inthe Aleppo governorate for six months, and received 15 days of training in atraining camp.[62] Hesustained shrapnel injuries in his first battle, at Sheikh Najjar, and had beenin the hospital for three months. He said that other children his age alsofought with the brigade, as well as a child one year younger than him.[63]On March 7, 2014, the National Coalition of SyrianRevolutionary and Opposition Forces announced that it had implemented “newtraining for Free Syrian Army members in International Humanitarian Law toeliminate the recruitment and participation of children in armed conflict.”[64]A few days later, the UN special representative of the secretary-general forchildren and armed conflict also announced that the Syrian National Council andthe Free Syrian Army had “sought the United Nations’ assistance toend the recruitment and use of children in their ranks.”[65]Islamic State of Iraqand Sham (ISIS)Human Rights Watch found, based on interviews with fourformer ISIS child fighters and two adult fighters, as well as civilians inISIS-controlled areas,that ISIS has actively recruited children to sendto their military training camps and used them in military operations, includingsuicide bombing missions. The two adults interviewed had attended ISIS trainingcamps in the Aleppo governorate and observed children as young as 13 receivingtraining. Of the four children interviewed, the youngest began fighting at age15.Interviews indicated that ISIS also recruited children atyounger ages. An FSA military commander told Human Rights Watch he captured 30children between ages 13 and 15 who had fought with ISIS and attempted torehabilitate them by isolating them in a remote rural location and bringingreligious leaders as well as male relatives to speak with them.[66]Researchers interviewed two medical service providers who treated children asyoung as 12 injured while fighting with ISIS.[67] Severalinterviewees reported interacting with children 13 years old or younger whotrained or served with ISIS.The four children we interviewed said ISIS recruited them throughpublic forums and ideological tools, rather than through community or family networks.None of these children had relatives in those units. Bassim, 17, said he joinedat age 16 after attending speeches and sermons given by members of the group.[68]After attending speeches at public mosques, he began visiting the ISISheadquarters in Salqin for additional lessons about religion and jihad.[69]He told Human Rights Watch that his father supported his participation with thegroup and that he left after sustaining serious shrapnel wounds in battle.[70]Raed, 17, said that he was also attracted to ISIS despite not having personalconnections to the group.[71]“When ISIS came to my town…I liked what they are wearing, they werelike one herd. They had a lot of weapons. So I spoke to them, and decided to gotheir training camp in Kafr Hamra in Aleppo.”[72]He attended the training camp when he was 16 years old. “The leader ofthe camp said [ISIS] liked the younger ones better,” he said. “Hetold me, ‘Tomorrow they’ll be a stronger leader or a strongerfighter.’”[73]Both children and adults who fought with ISIS consistentlyreported seeing children 13 years old or younger undergoing the same trainingand performing the same military duties as adults. Two adult fighters whoattended an ISIS training camp near Jarablus reported seeing children intraining. Ahmed, 20, trained for 15 days. He said that in his training group of200, there were children as young as 13 or 14, and that “many” ofthe trainees appeared to be under 18.[74]“Wissam,” 22, who attended the same camp in the Jarablus mountainsfor 45 days, said he saw children aged 13 and 14, and estimated that 60 percentof the trainees were under 18.[75]At age 16, Riad trained for 15 days in Kafr Hamra, Aleppo, witha group of between 250 to 300 people, he said. In his group, he said that manyof the trainees were under 18, and some as young as 12 years old:It was a very difficult camp. They gave us a very severetraining. We would wake up, pray, after prayer maybe around 9 a.m. we didexercises, then rest in the room, then Sharia courses, then military study,then more Sharia courses, then some rest, prayer.[Between afternoon prayers], they didn’t let ussleep, they would come in our tent and fire into the sky and [send us] to guarda trench. Many times we fell asleep in this trench because we were so tired.[76]Amr, 17, told Human Rights Watch that he joined the DaoudBrigade in his hometown of Sarmeen in Idlib governorate when he was 15.[77]At the time he joined, the Daoud Brigade was an independent Islamist group but joinedforces with ISIS from late 2013 until late January 2014.[78]Amr said that his unit included children as young as 15.[79]When he first joined the Daoud Brigade at age 15, he said,he participated in a “sleeper cell” to collect information on thegovernment’s operations in Idlib. He told Human Rights Watch that thethree others in his cell were the same age as he.[80]After he had been collecting information for six months, government forcesarrested the other members of his group. Amr told Human Rights Watch:That was when I decided to join the jihadi movement fulltime. I joined in an indirect way, so that my mother and father would not knowI had joined an armed jihadi group.[81]The group gave him weapons and equipment, he said: “Igot a Kalashnikov with six [ammunition] cartridges, and a military uniform witha bulletproof vest.” He also received a salary of US$100 a month, whilehe said that adult fighters received US$200 a month.[82]Amr told Human Rights Watch that fighters in his unit,including children, signed up for suicide attack missions. “They had alist of people who volunteered to do suicide bombing operations. I signed up onthe list, but reluctantly and at the end, so my name was [several hundred down].”[83]Amr said he eventually signed the list because he felt social pressure to doso.Abu Musafir, a leader ofthe Fursan al-Furat battalion from Minbej in Aleppo governorate, said heconsistently saw children fighting when engaged in battles against ISIS.“Every battle we fight with Da`esh [ISIS] is a fight,” he said.“We’re trying to stay alive. But when we finish the battle and lookat the corpses [of the ISIS fighters], we see a lot of children.”[84]Abu Musafir told Human Rights Watch that his battaliondetained 30 children ages 13 to 15 fighting with ISIS after a battle with ISISin Minbej in late 2013. “We found them in a training camp in Minbej, allof them were from Minbej,” he said. “We kept them fortwo-and-a-half months. We put them in a rural area with a school and we triedto reverse the brainwashing of ISIS.”[85]A doctor who had worked at a clinic in Tal Abyad in Raqqagovernorate told Human Rights Watch he treated two children injured whiletraining or serving in ISIS military camps:[In August 2013,] a child came in who appeared to bebetween 10 and 12 years old, called “Abu Bakr.” His hand had beencut by a piece of metal. [We] talked to his escort, an armed man from “Da`esh”[ISIS] who came and brought him. He said this boy was a guard in their prisonin Tal Abyad, and he had the job of whipping prisoners.[In November,] a 14 year old came into the clinic. He hadbeen shooting a rock in the training camp and the pieces came back and hit him,they splintered in his stomach. He came with an escort of about 10 armed men.They were dressed in the Pakistani style, wearing short pants and a tunic,mostly black. [The boy] had to have two operations, and the second time, agroup of children from the camp came to visit, they were all dressed the sameway.[86]Emad, a former teacher from Raqqa, told Human Rights Watchthat in November 2013, he entered the Islamic court run by ISIS in Mansoura, inRaqqa governorate, which was held in the Mansoura primary school.[87]“The guards were six children, they appeared to be between 12 and 16years old,” he said. “They were carrying weapons and wearing explosivebelts.”[88] Thechildren were wearing masks, but he guessed their ages from their voices andfrom their stature.[89] Fourother interviewees reported seeing children who appeared to be between 13 and16 years old guarding checkpoints in the Raqqa governorate on the road to TelAbyad, an area controlled by ISIS.Jabhat al-NusraHuman Rights Watch found that Jabhat al-Nusra has activelyrecruited children through free schooling programs that included weaponstraining and other public events. Children interviewed by Human Rights Watchsaid that commanders did not discourage recruitment because of age. Three whojoined Jabhat al-Nusra brigades in Daraa and Idlib said the youngest joining atraining camp was 14.A 19-year-old who joined Jabhat al-Nusra in Aleppo saidhe did so when he was 17.Majed, 16, from Inkhilin the Daraa governorate, described how Jabhat al-Nusra recruited him at age 15through an educational program that later included weapons training.[90]He said:[Jabhat al] Nusra used to tell us to come and learn withthem. They would bring a car and go around to houses to pick up children. Wewere 60 people, [between] the ages [of] 12… and 20.They taught children how to read the Quran, then taughtabout weapons. They taught us how to take apart and put together a weapon. Theyput a target for us to practice shooting outside the mosque. Anyone who hit thetarget got a reward. If a family needed more supplies, for example, this wouldbe a reward.[91]Majed stayed with Jabhat al-Nusra for three months, he said,and participated in a military operation to take over government checkpointsaround Inkhil in late 2013. During his military service, he said, leadersassigned him to a group of 25 fighters of whom 7 were under 18, and the youngestapproximately 12 years old.[92]Omar, 16, first attended a Jabhat al-Nusra training campwhen he was 14. His father was a Jabhat al-Nusra fighter.[93]Omar told Human Rights Watch that in 2011 he joined demonstrations from hisschool, where he was in the sixth grade.[94]Then, he joined public demonstrations in his hometown of Salqin in Idlibgovernorate. After shabiha (members of pro-government militas)threatened him with a knife in the street, he said, his father brought him to aJabhat al-Nusra headquarters.[95] Soonafter, he left for a 20-day training camp in the mountains of Kafr Takharim,where he said three other children aged 12 to 17 trained alongside him.[96]He described his daily schedule:We woke up at 5 a.m. to pray and then have breakfast. Thenwe had a military lesson on how to use weapons, then a religious lesson, thennoon prayer, then lessons on how to make and use hand bombs and mines.[97]After training, Omar told Human Rights Watch, he participatedin a battle at Taftanaz airport in late 2012, and a battle at al-Gaziya checkpointin Salqin, in early 2013. Both are in Idlib governorate. In his first battle,at Taftanaz, he said:[During] the first two days, I hesitated to go to the frontline and felt so afraid. Then our sheikh came to encourage us to go fight andgave us speeches about jihad, so after two days I went to front line.[98]He said that Jabhat al-Nusra paid him a salary of 20,000Syrian pounds (US$135) a month.[99] Saleh,who joined Jabhat al-Nusra in March 2014 when he was 17, and fought with themin the battle at Kasab in Latakia governorate in April 2014, said he received asalary of 10,000 Syrian pounds (US$68) plus a food box monthly.[100]Yekîneyên ParastinaGel (YPG) and AsayishHuman Rights Watch reported on human rights violations committedin Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria, including the recruitment and use ofchildren, in June 2014. Since assuming power in 2012, the YPG and the Asayish,the police arm of the PYD, have deployed boys and girls at checkpoints and onbases in all three areas under their control: Jazira, Ain al-`Arab, and `Afrin.In December 2013, YPG General Command issued an order thatprohibited children under age 18 from participating in the YPG. The orderstated that those in violation will be held “strictly accountable.”[101]This reiterated the prohibition on child recruitment in article 5.2 of theYPG’s internal regulations, which states that YPG members must be 18 orolder.YPG spokesman, Redul Xelil, told Human Rights Watch that theYPG had implemented the order by removing from military operations 17 peopleunder age 18, instead assigning them tasks in media, education or politicaltraining centers. In a February 2014 meeting, Xelil said that no YPG membershad been disciplined for having violated the regulations of the December order.[102]Asayish internal regulations in article 7.2 also forbidindividuals under 18 from joining the police force. Head of internal securityin Jezira, Kanan Barakat, who supervises the Asayish there, said on February 9,2014, that the force previously enlisted children but that practice changed“four or five months ago.”He said that currently all Asayishmembers had to be over 25 and there are no children in the force.[103]However, during a visit to Jazira in February 2014, HumanRights Watch found continued evidence of child participation in both the YPGand Asayish. Researchers interviewed a 16-year-old boy who said he had been inthe YPG since the previous year, the mother of a 13-year-old boy who joined inDecember 2013, and the brother of a 17-year-old who joined in January 2014.The 16 year old, Arhat, told Human Rights Watch he joined atage 15 after going to YPG meetings at local youth centers, where YPG membersspoke to him and other children. “They would talk to us about the Kurdishsituation and explain the importance of defending the [Kurdish] nation,”he said. “It is our choice to join. … My mom and dad were againstit and said no but I wanted to.”[104]Arhat said he went to a YPG base to register with his realname and age, and the YPG allowed him to join.He received weaponstraining and has since worked at checkpoints, and been sent to places wherethere have been explosions to conduct investigations after the fact. “Inthe morning I go to school and then I go to serve,” he said.A woman in Qamishli said her 13-year-old son had joined theYPG in December 2013 without her knowledge after spending time at a PYD youthcenter.[105]AKurdish man from Amuda said his 17-year-old brother had joined the YPG inJanuary 2014. The man said his brother had left home without informing the familyof his intentions:He disappeared and for three daysmy parents searched for him everywhere, including police stations and securitybranches, but they didn’t find him. On the fourth day a YPG official, nothigh ranking, came to my parent’s house and told them that he had joinedthe YPG.[106]Human Rights Watch also spoke to two girls, both aged 17, whowere armed and guarding Asayish checkpoints in Malikiyah and near the Semelka (FayshKhabour)border crossing with KRG. The Faysh Khabour guard said she had workedwith the Asayish for more than two years.International Legal StandardsInternational humanitarian law (the laws of war) andhuman rights law prohibit the recruitment and use of children as soldiers. TheSecond Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Protocol II),which applies during non-international armed conflicts, prohibits states andnon-state armed groups from recruiting or using children under the age of 15 inarmed conflict. While Syria is not a party to Protocol II, the prohibition onthe recruitment and use of children below the age of 15 is now consideredcustomary international law, and is binding on all parties to armed conflict.In 2000, the UN adopted theOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on theinvolvement of children in armed conflict (the “Optional Protocol”).[107]The Optional Protocol, to which Syria is a party, raisedthe standards set in the Convention on the Rights of the Child by establishing18 as the minimum age for any conscription or forced recruitment or directparticipation in hostilities. Article 4 bans any recruitment or use ofchildren under 18 by non-state armed groups:“[A]rmed groups thatare distinct from the armed forces of a state should not, under anycircumstances, recruit or use in hostilities persons under the age of eighteen.”[108]The protocol also places obligations on governments to"take all feasible measures to prevent such recruitment and use, includingthe adoption of legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalize suchpractices.”[109]Individuals who commit serious violations of international humanitarianlaw with criminal intent are responsible for war crimes. Under customaryinternational humanitarian law and the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court (ICC), it is a war crime for members of armed forces or non-statearmed groups to conscript or enlist children under 15, or to use them toparticipate actively in hostilities.[110] TheICC statute clarifies that individual criminal liability also extends beyondthe use of children as armed combatants. Under the ICC, the war crime ofrecruiting or using child soldiers:Cover[s] both directparticipation in combat and also active participation in military activitieslinked to combat such as scouting, spying, sabotage and the use of children asdecoys, couriers or at military checkpoints. … [U]se of children in adirect support function such as acting as bearers to take supplies to the frontline, or activities at the front line itself, would be included.[111]Prior to Syria’s ratification of the Optional Protocolin October 2003, it adopted measures to comply with the treaty.On June30, 2013, the government enacted Law No. 11 of 2013, which criminalized allforms of recruitment and the use of children under the age of 18 by armedforces and non-state armed groups, including taking part in direct combat,carrying and transporting weapons or equipment or ammunition, plantingexplosions, standing at checkpoints or carrying out surveillance orreconnaissance, acting as a distraction or human shield or assisting or servingthe perpetrators in any way or form.[112]AcknowledgmentsThis report was researched and written by PriyankaMotaparthy, researcher in the Children’s Rights Division of Human RightsWatch.Zama Coursen-Neff, director of the Children’s RightsDivision, contributed to the research and edited the report.
