Upon arriving in Malta, they told the authorities their birth dates as part of routine data collection, but were not provided with information about procedures to establish themselves officially as minors, and were taken directly to adult detention.© 2012 Human Rights WatchSummaryI left Côte d’Ivoire at 16. My family waspersecuted, there was violence and war. I went through Niger, Mali, and toLibya, in trucks. Then from Libya to Malta by boat…. For someone at 17 tobe in detention, it's not normal. Seven months of detention, it's not normal.—StéphaneK., an unaccompanied migrant child in Malta, March 2012My expectation was that I would come here, apply for asylum and be safe. I didn't expectto be in detention for so long. In the end I don’t understand whatbenefit this will bring to Malta … I don’t see why we have to passthrough detention before being granted freedom.—BerhaneK., an Eritrean asylum-seeker in Malta, March 2012Click to expand ImageMalta routinely detains an average of 1,500 people per year,including children, who arrive in the country by boat without permission, or“irregularly.” These are migrants and asylum seekers, typicallyfrom Somalia, Eritrea, and other sub-Saharan African countries, who travel toEurope fleeing persecution or in search of a better life. Many have fledviolence and conflict, and almost all have made an arduous journey, takingmonths to cross the Sahara and travel north through Libya. The last stage ofthat journey is a perilous, multi-day trip across the Mediterranean, typicallyin overcrowded vessels that are not seaworthy, and without enough food, water,or fuel, before they reach Maltese shores or are intercepted at sea by the ArmedForces of Malta.Boat migrants arriving in Malta are taken straight todetention if they lack an entry visa (as they virtually all do). This reportaddresses their arbitrary, indiscriminate, and unfair detention. The reportfocuses on those who arrive in Malta by boat, as migrants who arrive in Maltaby air for the most part are not detained, even if they enter under falsepretenses or subsequently claim asylum. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat aredetained for up to 12 months, and migrants who do not apply for asylum, orwhose asylum claims are rejected, can be detained for up to 18 months. Underinternational law migrants who do not have permission to enter or stay in acountry may be subject to detention, in certain circumstances, and also may be subjectto safeguards. However in Malta, the detention policy operates in an automated,indiscriminate, and blanket manner in violation of international law.In the course of this virtually automated detention policy,Malta routinely detains unaccompanied migrant children whose age is inquestion. “Unaccompanied children” are migrants under the age of 18(typically between 14 and 17) who travel without parents or caregivers.Migrants who claim to be unaccompanied children go through an age determinationprocedure, which relies on interviews and occasional medical testing toestablish age. In 2007 and 2008, for example, around 400 children each yeararrived in Malta claiming to be unaccompanied.[1]While they register for and undergo the age determination procedure, Maltakeeps these children in detention.Whereas most children who arrive with their families arequickly moved from detention facilities to open centers, unaccompanied migrantchildren are detained for longer periods.Malta detains even the most vulnerable migrants. Familieswith children, elderly people, and people with mental or physical disabilities,are taken to detention, though most are released before the 12 or 18 month timelimit.Unaccompanied migrant children are detained for the durationof their age determination procedure, which can take weeks or months. Amongthose we interviewed detained between 2008 and 2012 who Malta ultimatelydetermined to be children, the average time in detention was 3.4 months, andthe maximum time 7 months. Those who are found to be under 18 are thenaccommodated in group homes outside detention centers.Malta applies a very low threshold for determining that anindividual should enter the age determination process: anyone who is not“visibly” a child (an ad-hoc cut-off seemingly around 12 or 14years of age) is detained. During detention, children live and sleep withadults, without any special accommodation for their young age and withoutaccess to education. A 15-year-old boy, who was detained with adults andvisibly scared when interviewed, said, “It’s very difficult to livehere at Safi [a detention facility]. I’m afraid to live where peoplemight hit me … I don’t have anyone to take care of me.”[2]While Malta justifies its prolonged detention of migrants asa legitimate response to irregular entry, the practice amounts to arbitrarydetention prohibited by international law. Prolonged administrative custody,without the possibility of meaningful review, violates the prohibition onarbitrary detention in article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights, and the European Court of Human Rights has foundMalta’s detention policy to violate the European Convention’sprovisions on the right to liberty. Children enjoy particular protection underthe law: in principle, migrant children should not be detained, and where theyare detained it must be as a last resort for the shortest appropriate period oftime.Malta’s detention facilities can become overcrowdedand unsanitary, though they have improved in recent years. Nonetheless,prolonged detention takes a huge mental toll on migrants, and childrenespecially may experience declining mental health. For example, Kelile T., whoreported that he was 17 years old when he arrived in Malta in 2011, wasdetained for nine months before he was hospitalized for 15 days for mentalhealth treatment, and then returned to detention. He described his experiencein detention: “I take medicine now, for sleep. No medicine, I can't sleep… my mind is no good, it is very hard.… I can't, I can't ... thisis a hard place. I need a free place.”[3]Flawed Maltese and European Migration PoliciesMalta’s detention policy is part of flawed approachesto migration, both by Malta itself and by the European Union (EU). The centralMediterranean migration route—typically from Libya to Malta orItaly—is a major entrance point to the EU. Since 2002, approximately15,000 migrants have reached Malta by this route, some intentionally, many bymistake as they stumble across the small island country while hoping to reachItaly. While the number of migrants arriving in Malta is low in absolute terms,Malta now has the highest number of asylum seekers relative to the nationalpopulation of any country in the industrialized world. Malta, a country of only400,000 people, received 20.1 asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants in the years2007-2011, whereas France, the EU member state receiving the largest number ofasylum seekers in absolute terms in 2011, received about 3 per 1,000.Although migrants have been traveling this migrationroute—in higher or lower numbers—for some ten years, neither Maltanor the EU has developed a sound policy that either respects migrants’human rights or that addresses the high burden placed on Malta. EU asylum rulesmean that member states at EU borders sometimes are forced to assumeresponsibility for a vastly disproportionate share of migrants and asylumseekers. The Dublin II regulation, promulgated in 2003, mandates that anindividual’s asylum application must be processed in the country wherethe individual first entered the EU. This places an unfair burden on Malta,which must process these asylum applications in-country and which is obliged toaccept the return of any asylum seekers whose first port of entry in the EU wasMalta.The EU has taken somesteps towards mitigating this burden, for instance by relocating recognizedrefugees from Malta to other EU states and providing limited financial support.But these steps have been insufficient to assist Malta in meetingmigrants’ needs. The case of Malta, like that of Greece, shows the needto revise the Dublin II regulation to permit greater burden sharing inprocessing and hosting asylum seekers, rather than insisting on the country offirst arrival as the primary factor in assessing member state responsibility.Malta’s arbitrary detention policy, in addition toviolating international standards, does not work to deter migrants from landingon its shores. Migrants may not intend to travel to Malta, and indeed the boatsin which they travel lack navigational equipment that would enable them tochoose their destination. Some migrants Human Rights Watch spoke with said theydid not even know that Malta existed as a country before they landed there.Though Malta’s burden is disproportionately large,detention is neither a legal nor a sound response to boat migration in thecentral Mediterranean. Both Malta and the EU should enact new policies torespond to their legal obligations to uphold migrants’ rights.Malta should allow detention of migrantsonly in exceptional circumstances, with individualized determinations, andaccess to procedures to challenge detention.Malta should treat those who claim to bechildren as such pending the outcome of age determination proceedings, andrelease all those with pending claims from detention.The EU should reform the Dublin system byhaving the Dublin regulation take into account equitable burden-sharing amongmember countries.RecommendationsTo the Government of MaltaRevise laws and policies pertaining toimmigration detention, so that migrants are not detained simply because theyhave entered without permission.Allow for detention of asylum seekers onlyexceptionally;Give migrants access to a remedy whereby they caneffectively challenge their detention, in line with standards laid out by theEuropean Court of Human Rights, and ensure that these mechanisms are accessiblefor children and persons with disabilities;Issue official paperwork to start deportation onlyat the conclusion of due process proceedings to determine removability andafter claims for protection or other claims against removal have beenconsidered;Detain those with pending removal orders only whereproceedings to that end are underway and are being pursued with due diligence.Bring policies on detention in line withstandards articulated by the Council of Europe and the European Convention onHuman Rights. Namely:Execute fully, effectively, and immediately thejudgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Louled Massoud v. Malta,which found that detention of Khaled Louled Massoud was arbitrary and inviolation of the European Convention;Give full effect to the Council of EuropeParliamentary Assembly Resolution 1707 (2010) “Detention of asylumseekers and irregular migrants in Europe,” in particular by usingalternatives to detention wherever possible.End the unnecessary detention ofunaccompanied migrant children.Amend legislation to prohibit the immigrationdetention of migrant children (pending age determination) for the sole reasonthat they arrived irregularly;In the interim period while detention continues,use separate detention facilities for those with pending age determinationrequests;Change the legal framework of migrant detention sothat children detained pending age determination may effectively challengetheir detention without waiting for the conclusion of the age determinationprocess.To the Ministry of Homeand Parliamentary AffairsDetain migrants, including asylum seekers,only in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. Detention should occuronly if, after a review of all alternatives, it is concluded that in thespecific case there is no effective alternative.Explore the use of open centers as an effectivealternative to detention; ensure that open centers are accessible to peoplewith physical disabilities.Refrain from detaining potentiallyvulnerable migrants upon arrival in Malta. Ensure rapid identification andrelease of vulnerable migrants.Accelerate and improve process for identifyingvulnerable people immediately upon arrival, and transfer them to openfacilities rather than detention. Include screening for mental and physicaldisabilities as part of initial screening procedures for all migrants.Reform the age determination procedure totreat applicants who claim to be children as under age until proven otherwise.Release those with pending cases to alternateaccommodation, such as an open living facility, until age determination iscompleted.Take allpractical steps to reduce the time of age determination proceedings, includingby:Supporting the Agency for the Welfare of AsylumSeekers (AWAS) with additional capacity during peak seasons; andEncouraging faster processing of medical testing.Provide for administrative or judicialappeal of age determination decisions.Provide unaccompanied children with freelegal representation to challenge the legality of their detention (when theyare detained) and to assist with asylum applications.To the Malta Police,Immigration SectionRefrain from detaining potentiallyvulnerable migrants upon arrival in Malta.Instruct arresting officers and all otherswith routine contact with migrants to heed migrants’ claims that they arechildren, increase efforts to identify those who might be children, and referboth categories to age determination in a speedy time frame.To the DetentionServicesStrengthen contingency plans to avertovercrowding and consequent deterioration of conditions during peak migrationperiods.Improve training of detention officers toenable them identify detainees exhibiting mental health problems, and improveavailable mental health services in detention, based on the principle ofinformed consent.Inform migrants of the availability and theprocess for the age determination procedure, including information onanticipated timing of the procedure and process for appeal.Until such time as children pending agedetermination are no longer detained as a matter of policy, instruct detentionstaff and all others with routine contact with migrants to heed migrants’claims that they are children, increase efforts to identify those who might bechildren, and refer both categories to age determination within a speedy timeframe.Where children remain in detention pendingage determination, provide separate accommodation from adults specificallydesigned to meet children’s needs.To the Agency for theWelfare of Asylum SeekersFurther embrace best practices for agedetermination:Provisionally treat those claiming to be under 18as children until age determination is completed.Refrain from using radiological examinations, inlight of strong medical and ethical considerations discouraging their use. Inthe limited instances where medical tests are carried out, rely instead onnon-intrusive and non-invasive examinations including non-radiological methodsof imaging bone density and dental observation; and anthropometricmeasuring. Speed up age determination, including by reducingtime for medical testing.If doubts remain that the person is underage, grantthe benefit of the doubt.Provide for administrative or judicial appeal ofage determination decisions.Inform migrants of the availability of andsteps for the age determination procedure, including instructions on theprocess for appeal.Ensure rapid identification and release ofvulnerable migrants.Accelerate and improve process for identifyingvulnerable people immediately upon arrival, and transfer them to openfacilities rather than detention.Include more comprehensive screening process formental and physical disabilities as part of initial screening procedures forall migrants.To the Office of theRefugee CommissionerProvide unaccompanied children with freelegal representation in all stages of asylum proceedings.To the European UnionProvide financial, material, and logisticalassistance to Malta for the reception and processing of migrants and asylumseekers.Broaden intra-EU relocation of recognized refugeesand other migrants with protection status from Malta. Permit greater family reunification in other partsof the EU of recognized refugees and other migrants with protection status inMalta, particularly with wider family relations for unaccompanied migrantchildren.After a lawful deportation order has been issuedfollowing due process and the exhaustion of legal remedies, and after voluntaryrepatriation has been offered, and, in the case of children, abest-interests-of-the-child determination has been made, assist Malta throughthe European Return Fund in facilitating voluntary and dignified return andreintegration of migrants who do not have a protection need and who can besafely returned to their home countries, for example, by providing diplomaticassistance with countries of origin to procure travel documents, and financialand logistical assistance to carry out removals.Reform the Dublin system by having theDublin regulation take into account equitable burden-sharing among membercountries that genuinely have common asylum standards and procedures by, forexample, consideration of joint EU processing within EU countries for specificcaseloads.In assessing the state responsible forexamining asylum claims, accord less weight than under the current Dublin regulationto the country of first arrival. Alternative considerations might go beyond thequalifying family relationships in the Dublin II regulation to include widerfamily relations (especially for unaccompanied migrant children), communityties, prior residence, language, job skills that might be in demand in onecountry over another, and personal preference of the applicant.Invest in programs in countries of origin inorder to address the root causes that compel children to undertake dangerousjourneys and educate them and their parents on the risks of those journeys.MethodologyThis report addresses the treatment of migrants, includingunaccompanied children, in Malta, focusing on migrants who travel to Malta byboat and either arrive on shore themselves or are intercepted by the ArmedForces of Malta at sea and brought to Malta. It does not address migrants whoenter Malta by plane, because they are not typically detained in the samemanner or with the same degree of regularity as those who arrive by boat. Inthis report, the term “migrant” can refer to asylum seekers andpeople in need of international protection, as well as to economic migrants.Research was carried out in Malta between February and May2012. Eighty-eight migrants and asylum seekers between the ages of 10 and 67were interviewed. Sixteen of the interviewees were female. Twenty-one migrantswere, according to their accounts, unaccompanied children at the time of theirentry into Malta. Eight were still children when we interviewed them, and theother thirteen were adults. Two reported entering Malta below the age of 16,and the rest were 16 or 17 years old when they entered the country.Approximately 35 percent of our interviewees were fromSomalia, 10 percent from Nigeria, 10 percent from Eritrea, 9 percent fromEthiopia, 9 percent from Ghana, and 9 percent from Ivory Coast. The rest werefrom Egypt and sub-Saharan African countries including Chad, Guinea, Mali, andTogo.We conducted most interviews in English or French, and otherinterviews with the help of interpreters in a language in which the migrant wascomfortable (such as Arabic and Somali). We interviewed migrants and asylumseekers in three separate detention facilities (Hermes Block, Safi Warehouse,and Safi B Block), in and around open centers, and in various locations aroundMalta. We explained to all interviewees the nature of our research and ourintentions concerning the information gathered through our interviews, and weobtained verbal consent from each interviewee.In Malta, Human Rights Watch researchers met a number ofgovernment officials concerned with migration, including the RefugeeCommissioner, the Children’s Commissioner, and officials with the Agencyfor the Welfare of Asylum Seekers, the Malta Police, the Detention Service, theChildren and Young Persons Advisory Board, the Office of the Children’sCommissioner, and the Ministry of Justice and the Family. In addition, we metwith representatives from the Maltese offices of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees, the European Asylum Support Office, and the InternationalOrganization of Migration, as well as staff members of nongovernmentalorganizations, and human rights lawyers and activists.All names of migrants interviewed have been replaced bypseudonyms to protect their identity. In some cases we also withhold themigrant’s country of origin, or precise details of the migrant’scase, in order to avoid the possibility of identifying the individual.Likewise, many staff members of NGOs in Malta are not identified by name attheir request.In line with international instruments, the term“child” refers to a person under the age of 18.[4] Forthe purposes of this report, we use the term “unaccompanied child”to describe both unaccompanied and separated children as defined by theCommittee on the Rights of the Child:“Unaccompanied children” are children, asdefined in article 1 of the Convention, who have been separated from bothparents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult who, by lawor custom, is responsible for doing so. “Separated children” arechildren, as defined in article 1 of the Convention, who have been separatedfrom both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary caregiver,but not necessarily from other relatives. These may, therefore, includechildren accompanied by other adult family members.[5]In this report, Human Rights Watch does not assess whetherthe migrants we spoke to qualify for refugee status or other forms ofprotection. Some, perhaps many, undoubtedly do—and indeed, the Maltesegovernment grants asylum or other forms of protection at relatively high ratescompared to other EU border countries.[6]This report instead focuses on how the Maltese government fails to upholdmigrants’ human rights, regardless of whether or not those migrants havelegitimate asylum claims or other protection needs, and how Malta’spolicies should be improved.I. Migrants and Asylum Seekers in MaltaIn the 10-year period from the beginning of 2002 to the endof 2011, 14,735 migrants traveled by boat to Malta, an average of 1,470 peryear.[7]Of the migrants who arrived in Malta by boat in this period, 93 percent appliedfor asylum.[8]At the time of writing, 838 migrants had arrived so far in 2012.[9] Migrantstypically traveled on boats leaving from Libya for Italy, many of which lackedadequate navigation systems and so arrived in Maltese waters instead.The flow of migrants and asylum seekers to Malta during this10-year period has not been consistent. Numbers peaked in 2008, with 2,775migrants entering, and in 2011, 1,579 migrants entered by boat.[10] In2010 the numbers of migrants entering Malta temporarily dropped. Concurrently,a joint agreement between Libya and Italy (to which Malta was not party) tointerdict and forcibly return boat migrants on the high seas between the twocountries was in operation.[11]The implementation of this agreement—in which Italian vessels towedmigrant boats from international waters back to Libya without even a cursory screeningfor whether those on board were refugees or sick or injured, and through whichthe number of boats leaving from Libya was drastically curtailed[12] —mayhave contributed to the decrease in travel to Malta during that year. Boatmigration to both Italy and Malta since resumed, in light of the Arab Spring in2011 and the suspension of the Libyan-Italian agreement after the collapse ofthe Libyan regime.Virtually all boat migrants who arrive in Maltesewaters—an average of 1,470 per year—are detained upon arrival.Maltese law mandates that a person who enters the country without “rightof entry” shall be designated a “prohibited immigrant” andmay be detained.[13]Mandatory detention of a prohibited immigrant occurs under the Immigration Actwith the issuance of a removal order, which, although not by law automatic,occurs, in practice, routinely at the time of apprehension.[14]The law says that after the removal order is issued, the prohibited immigrant“shall be detained in custody until he is removed from Malta.”Additionally, as a matter of Maltese government policy, prohibited immigrantswho apply for asylum will continue to be detained.[15]Most boat migrants and asylum seekers during this periodwere from sub-Saharan Africa. The largest group of the migrants—approximatelyone third—came originally from Somalia, while the second largest groupcame from Eritrea.[16]Other significant countries of origin included Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Côted’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Sudan.[17]Those claiming to be unaccompanied migrant children make upa significant portion of the migration flow to Malta. In 2007 and 2008, forexample, around 400 migrants each year arrived in Malta claiming to beunaccompanied children.[18]The rate at which those migrants are found to be children after an agedetermination process varies: in 2007, 21 percent were found to be children andin 2008, the rate was 8 percent.[19]In 2011, there were 61 unaccompanied minors recognized bythe Maltese authorities after an age determination process, of whom 29 were fromSomalia. In 2011, seven unaccompanied minors were girls.[20]Whereas most children who arrive with their families are accommodated in opencenters after a relatively short period in detention, a policy of detainingunaccompanied migrant children pending age determination and a low thresholdfor placing children in age determination proceedings means that almost allunaccompanied migrant children are detained for weeks or months in detentionfacilities with unrelated adults.For the most part, migrants and asylum seekers who arrive inMalta by air are not detained, because they arrive at official ports of entrywith the relevant documentation.[21]This report focuses on migrants who arrive by boat, who are considered to havearrived irregularly.ArduousJourneyThe trip to Malta can last many months, according to ourinterviewees. Typically, migrants might leave their countries of origin insub-Saharan Africa, travel to Sudan or Mali, then traverse the Sahara by truckor jeep before crossing into Libya. After traveling north in Libya, they boardboats to cross the Mediterranean Sea. Stéphane K. described his journey:“I left Ivory Coast when I was 16 years old. My family waspersecuted.… I went through Niger, Mali, and to Libya in trucks. Thenfrom Libya to Malta by boat. I’m not sure how many were in my boat,perhaps 100 to 160 people.”[22]The boat trips from Libya to Malta are perilous, involvingbasic vessels with limited navigation systems that are not seaworthy and oftenhave insufficient amounts of food, water, and fuel.[23]Celeste A., an Ivorian woman who arrived in Malta in 2011, said, “We wereat sea for 10 days. Without eating, without drinking. We arrived here almostdead, and they took us and put us in detention.”[24] MakaO., a man who arrived in 2011 from Nigeria, recounted, “We were threedays in the sea. The engine had problems and we were floating for three moredays. There were 73 people, not enough water, not enough food.”[25]Many boats capsize or go into distress, and may then beassisted by patrols from the Armed Forces of Malta.[26]For instance, Hani H., a Somali migrant who came to Malta in 2008, reportedthat his boat “bumped with an Italian fishing boat. All 28 of us, all thepeople in the water. The fishing boat gave us plastic [to use as buoys] andradioed in. A Maltese boat came and took us straight from the sea todetention.”[27]United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)estimates that 1,500 people died attempting to cross the Mediterranean toEurope in 2011, which amounts to approximately 2.5 percent of the 58,000migrants who made the crossing.[28]Indeed, many die on boats that reach Maltese waters. For instance, on May 5,2012, a boat reached a Maltese beach with 90 Somali passengers who reportedthat seven had died during their week-long trip from Libya.[29] Manyof our interviewees similarly recounted fatalities on their trip. For example,Fethee E., who was 15 years old when he left his native Ethiopia, said,“I came by boat from Libya … I was going to Italia but not eating,drinking … After the boat, I was three days in hospital. We were almost130 persons [on the boat] and one Nigerian woman died. We were traveling for 10days.”[30]Many migrants we interviewed, like Fethee, do not set offwith Malta as their destination. Rather, they are aiming for Europe generally,or Italy specifically. Aminata H., said, “I arrived in … 2011 byboat from Libya. I didn’t know that we were going to Malta. For me, theidea was to go to Italy.”[31]Sekou C., a Guinean migrant, agreed: “I came here from Libya by boat. Thegoal wasn’t to get to Malta.”[32]Migrants who arrive in Malta do not necessarily want to stopthere. In many cases, they are on boats without navigation systems—andmay wish to move on to mainland Europe. Malta has taken the approach of usingmandatory detention to dissuade migrants from arriving in Malta. This approachhas little deterrent effect in practice, given that migrants often cannotcontrol their destination.Flightfrom Poverty, Persecution, War, and ViolenceMany interviewees told Human Rights Watch that hardship andviolence in their home countries motivated their journeys to Europe. Many alsopointed to Europe as a place of greater economic opportunity. Given the highproportion of migrants who arrive in Malta from Somalia, it is no surprise thatconflict spurred some migrants’ decision to move.Particularly among the unaccompanied migrant children weinterviewed, the death of one or both parents, and violence in their homecountries, often triggered their decisions to leave. According to studies bythe international NGO Save the Children, unaccompanied migrant children alsomigrate to contribute to their family’s income, seek educationalopportunities, or escape violence or conflict.[33]Many of the migrants we interviewed who came to Malta withinthe last 18 months told us the increasingly difficult conditions in Libyaencouraged them to move on toward Europe. For instance, Maka, from Nigeria,reported, “we were in Libya for three years, but then there was theGaddafi problem. I lost my father, the Gaddafi rebels killed him…. I hadto find my way out, I travelled to Europe.” Amadou K.’s story wassimilar: “I was living in Guinea, then I arrived in Libya and there wasthe problem of the war, so I decided to leave. My goal was to leave Libya asquickly as possible. I arrived here [in Malta] by chance.”[34]Asylumin Malta and International Burden SharingMalta has the highestrate of asylum applications per population in the industrialized world.[35]Compared to its tiny size—the population of Malta is approximately400,000 people—the island sees a disproportionately high percentage ofthe migrants entering the EU.[36] While the EU provides somefinancial assistance to Malta,[37]it fails to provide sufficient cooperation with relocation programs, asylumdetermination procedures, and integration options to adequately address theneeds of migrants and asylum seekers in Malta.Ninety-three percent of the migrants who arrive in Malta byboat—almost all of whom are detained upon arriving on the island—applyfor asylum. Malta has an efficient asylum-processing system with one of thelowest backlogs in Europe, and a 58 percent rate of recognition for some formof protected status (though not necessarily asylum), considerably higher thanthe EU average.[38]In 2011, four percent of applicants were granted refugee status.[39]A further 37 percent were granted subsidiary protection.[40]Subsidiary protection is a category of international protection defined by theEU to apply to those facing a “real risk of suffering serious harm”in their country of origin but who do not meet the more stringent requirementsof qualifying for asylum.[41]Subsidiary protection gives recipients fewer benefits than those with fullrefugee status, in part because it was initially considered a temporary form ofprotection, and is time limited and subject to review.[42] Forinstance, EU laws give more limited access to labor markets for people withsubsidiary protection than for refugees.[43]Those not qualifying for asylum or subsidiary protection maystill acquire a domestic form of temporary protection, called New TemporaryHumanitarian Protection, or “THP(N),” to some migrants who do notqualify for refugee status or subsidiary protection.[44] Thisstatus, granted at the discretion of the Office of the Refugee Commissioner,permits migrants to work legally in Malta, but not to travel within the EU, andis subject to yearly review based on criteria set by the Refugee Commissioner.In 2011, 17 percent of those who applied for asylum were granted this status.[45]Unaccompanied migrant children may apply for asylum, asdescribed above. Care for unaccompanied children is split between threeministries and numerous agencies. After the Minister for Justice, Dialogue, andthe Family issues the care order, the child is then placed in a group home runby AWAS, an entity under the Ministry of Home and Parliamentary Affairs.Children under AWAS’s care are entitled to education and at that stagetheir needs fall to the Ministry of Education.[46]After release from detention, migrants can find it hard tointegrate into Maltese society. They sometimes experience xenophobia andracism, have trouble finding work, and have uncertainty around their legalcapacity to stay. There are only a few local or national initiatives to helpthose with legal status integrate into the country.[47] Manymigrants want to stay in Malta, but others would like to join family elsewherein Europe. European policies on relocation within Europe and familyreunification are not clear and exacerbate the uncertainty many migrants feelabout their situation. While the EU places a heavy burden on Malta and othercountries at the external borders of the EU, integration is nonethelessconsidered an important aspect of responding to the needs of those withinternational protection.[48]In 1999, the EUcommitted to establishing a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) which wouldharmonize refugee standards and asylum procedures throughout the EU. Despitemultiple European Commission asylum directives over the past 12 years, thesehave failed to remedy wide disparities throughout the EU in the treatment ofasylum seekers.The Dublin II regulation,[49] which ostensiblyprevents asylum seekers from ‘forum shopping’ (or choosing adestination country) based on the idea that under CEAS all claims receive thesame process, sets out which member state is responsible for examining anasylum claim. It will normally be the country of first arrival. The regulationmeans that any asylum seeker who is registered in Malta and travels on toanother EU member state can be returned to Malta to have his or her asylumclaim heard there. Among its flaws, Dublin II ignores legitimate factors, suchas extended family and community ties, that asylum seekers consider whenchoosing where to apply for asylum, and unfairly allocates the burden ofprocessing asylum claims to the some states on the EU’s external borders,such as Greece, which is the main land entry point into the EU, and Malta,which is geographically close to north Africa.The EU has taken some steps to mitigate this burden, forinstance, by relocating recognized refugees from Malta to other EU states,[50]and by providing limited financial support. Only a relatively small number ofmigrants with protection from Malta have been relocated within the EU orresettled to the United States: From 2007 through mid-May 2012, 985 refugeeswere resettled from Malta to the United States.[51] In2010-2011, 228 others were relocated from Malta to other EU member states.[52]Yet the number of people relocated to the EU and the US may not stay consistentin the future, and is insufficient to relieve Malta of its burden. In addition,the EU has failed to develop adequate options for family reunification; forexample it has not allowed children who have been granted protection in Maltato join extended family in other European countries.The European Commissioner for Human Rights has emphasizedthat a lack of “meaningful international solidarity andco-operation” on the part of other EU countries contributes to the riskof serious rights violations against migrants in Malta.[53]Nonetheless, incomplete cooperation from the EU does not relieve Malta of itsobligations to treat migrants and asylum seekers humanely and offer options forlong-term integration.MalteseInstitutions Responsible for MigrantsResponsibility for migrants and unaccompanied migrantchildren is divided among various government entities:The Malta Police, Immigration Section is responsiblefor border activities, including border control at the airport, seaport, andyacht marinas.[54]The Detention Services are responsible for guardingimmigration detention facilities using staff seconded from the police and thearmed forces, as well as civilians.[55]The Board of Visitors for Detained Persons isresponsible for oversight of the immigration detention facilities, and has thelegal authority to visit the facilities monthly.[56]The Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS)manages open accommodation facilities; provides services to categories ofpersons identified as vulnerable, including unaccompanied children; conductsage determinations; provides information to asylum seekers regardingemployment, housing, education, health and welfare services offered undernational schemes; and liaises with government and civil society to advise onpolicy and service provision.[57]The Office of the Refugee Commissioner is responsiblefor an independent eligibility determination process for asylum applications.[58]The Refugee Commissioner falls under the Ministry of Homeand Parliamentary Affairs, which reviews each case as recommended by theCommissioner.[59]The Detention Service, the Malta Police, the Board of Visitors for DetainedPersons, and AWAS also all fall under the Ministry of Home and ParliamentaryAffairs.The Ministry of Justice, Dialogue, and the Family isresponsible for child policy and child protection. Unaccompanied migrantchildren are under the custody of the Children and Young Persons AdvisoryBoard,which is responsible for reviewing all the care plans relatedto each minor.[60]The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible forimplementing citizenship and immigration legislation and policies includingissuing residence permits to third country nationals.[61]The Maltese Commissioner for Children, which promotesthe welfare of children and compliance with the CRC, and the Ombudsman tothe people of Malta, who can investigate complaints against any governmentdepartment or agency, can also monitor the government’s treatment ofmigrants, including migrant children. [62]II. Automatic, Arbitrary DetentionMalta detains virtually every migrant who arrives by boatfor up to 12 months (if an asylum application is pending) or 18 months (if themigrant’s asylum claim has been rejected or he or she has not applied forasylum). However there is no evident justification for this prolongeddetention, and during their detention migrants have no meaningful opportunityfor judicial review in order to require the state to show such justification.Detention is more costly than alternative reception arrangements for migrants,and does not work as a mechanism for deterring migrants from travel to Malta.Remaining in detention can seriously impact the mental health of migrants, manyof whom are fleeing persecution, violence, or exploitation.Malta’s policy of prolonged, automatic immigrationdetention—without any meaningful possibility of judicial review orremedy—amounts to arbitrary detention prohibited by international law.Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights forbidsarbitrary detention, and the United Nations Working Group on ArbitraryDetention holds that a migrant or asylum seeker placed in detention “mustbe brought promptly before a judge or other authority.”[63]The Working Group’s mandate to investigate arbitrary deprivation ofliberty refers to five legal categories for arbitrary detention, including onedescribing arbitrary detention as “[w]hen asylum seekers, immigrants orrefugees are subjected to prolonged administrative custody without thepossibility of administrative or judicial review or remedy.”[64]In addition to going against these standards, Malta’s practices alsoviolate the prohibition of arbitrary detention in the European Convention onHuman Rights (ECHR).[65]Malta operates three primary immigration detentionfacilities[66]and a number of “open” (non-custodial) reception centers. Severalopen centers house adult migrants and migrants in families after their releasefrom detention.[67]Two open centers are specifically for unaccompanied children who have beenscreened and determined to be under 18.[68]Taken from Boats to ProlongedDetentionWhen boat migrants reach Malta, they are transferred to theMalta Police, Immigration Section, which is responsible for border control.[69]The Immigration Section collects a list of basic biographical data of those onthe boat and attempts to identify vulnerable migrants such as young children,people with disabilities, or people who are sick.Maltese law mandates that a person who enters the countrywithout “right of entry” shall be designated a “prohibitedimmigrant” and may be issued with a removal order.[70]Although the issuance of the removal order is discretionary, in practice thepolice routinely issue such orders at the time of apprehension and the migrantsare taken to detention.[71]The law mandates that prohibited immigrants “shall be detained incustody” once the removal order is issued “until he is removed fromMalta.”[72]At least initially, detention is imposed indiscriminately on all migrants whoarrive by boat, including vulnerable migrants (though many vulnerable migrantsare released earlier than others).Essentially, migrants are taken from their hazardousjourneys at sea straight to detention.For example, Chris K., a Nigerian migrant who said he was 17years old when he came to Malta, reported, “When I arrived, what happenedis like with every other immigrant, they took me to detention and I spentnearly 10 months there before I got my freedom.”[73]Dennis M., from Ghana, described his transition from a boat at sea todetention: “The police came out to sea to get us. They asked about ourdocuments, we don't have any documents. They took us to Safi [detentionfacility] the same day, and we stayed for one year.”[74]Once in detention, migrants attend an information session onthe asylum process run by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner, and are thenrequested to fill out a preliminary questionnaire.[75] TheMaltese Immigration Act does not establish a maximum duration for administrativedetention, of which immigration detention is a form. However, since 2005 theMaltese authorities have capped detention at 12 months for asylum seekers andat 18 months for those who have not applied for asylum or whose asylum claimshave been rejected in the first and second instances.[76] If amigrant’s asylum claim is granted before the expiration of the 12-monthperiod, that migrant is released.While the migrants and asylum seekers are not housed incriminal prisons, many who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that immigrationdetention inherently feels like a criminal punishment. Hakim A., who arrived inMalta from Eritrea in 2011, observed that he “felt like an animal indetention … detention is like prison.”[77]Zerihun A., from Ethiopia, stated “We were just looking for a betterlife. Detention felt like Guantanamo.”[78]In July 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found thatMalta’s detention of an Algerian asylum seeker, Khaleed Louled Massoud,violated the right to liberty found in the European Convention on Human Rights.[79]Among the arguments underscoring the court’s ruling was the notion thatthe Maltese authorities—in light of Malta being a small island withcontrolled exit by air—could have found less restrictive measures thandetention. The court found that insufficient grounds for detention, and theindeterminate length of detention in the law, meant that the Maltese legalsystem “did not provide for a procedure capable of avoiding the risk ofarbitrary detention” and the detention violated article 5—the rightto liberty and security—of the ECHR.[80]As a party to the ECHR, Malta is legally bound to implementthe judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. However, Malta has arguedthat this ruling applies only to the situation of Louled Massoud himself, as“the facts of this case were very particular,” in part because ofthe length of detention to which Louled was subject.[81]However, the then Commissioner for Human Rights for the Council of Europeasserted that “the general principles enunciated by the Court [in the LouledMassoud case] appear to be relevant to the situation of all those who aredetained in Malta pursuant to the relevant provisions of the ImmigrationAct.”[82]The Commissioner stated that Malta’s policy of mandatory and prolongedadministrative detention is “irreconcilable with the requirements of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the case-law of the StrasbourgCourt, especially following the latter’s July 2010 judgment in the caseof Louled Massoud.”[83]Lack of Capacity to ChallengeDetentionWhile very limited paths are available to challengedetention in Malta, these are insufficient to cover migrants’ needs orfulfill Malta’s legal obligations. Under the Immigration Act, detentionmay be appealed to the Immigration Appeals Board, an administrative rather thanjudicial body, within three days of the issuance of the removal order, or wheredetention is “unreasonable” pending an asylum application.[84]However, the Appeals Board may not authorize release when the identity of theapplicant has yet to be established (for instance, when the applicant does nothave travel or identification documents, as in the case of most boat migrantsreaching Malta).[85]This limited appeal is not sufficient to meet international standards: in Louledv. Malta the European Court of Human Rights found that the system in placethrough the Immigration Appeals Board does not constitute an effective remedyunder the European Convention on Human Rights.[86]None of the migrants interviewed by Human Rights Watch saidthey had access to legal proceedings to challenge their detention. Forinstance, Ali, from Somalia, said, “In prison, you have no lawyer, norights.”[87]According to the European Court of Human Rights in Louled v. Malta, theMaltese legal system lacks the necessary “effective and speedyremedy” for challenging the lawfulness of the applicant’sdetention.[88]The court found that none of the remedies available to migrants[89]were sufficient, leading to a violation of the right to liberty as set out inthe European Convention on Human Rights.[90]Inadequate Justificationfor DetentionMalta detains migrants for entering the country without“right of entry,” in other words not at a port of entry and withoutthe necessary documents.[91]Essentially, this means all boat migrants are detained, even though 93 percentapply for asylum.Malta’s detention policies do not correspond with thelimited circumstances in which detention of asylum seekers is permissible.Article 31 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which Malta is party, states thatpenalties should not be imposed on account of illegal entry or presence.UNHCR’s guidelines emphasize that the detention of asylum seekers whocome “in an irregular manner should … not be automatic, or undulyprolonged.”[92]Under these guidelines, detention of asylum seekers may bepermissible in order to verify identity (where identity is undetermined or indispute); determine the elements of the refugee claim (but not to justifydetention for the entire status determination procedure); in cases where asylumseekers have destroyed documents (requiring an intention to misleadauthorities); or to protect national security and public order.[93]Malta’s automatic extended detention policy does not fit with anyof these exceptional cases. In particular, the policy of detention is not aproportionate response to any potential threat to national security or publicorder (given that after 12 or 18 months, the migrant will be released to thecommunity without an individualized assessment of the threat he or she poses).[94]The Maltese authorities have indicated that the detentionpolicy exists in part to deter migrants from coming to Malta.[95]However, it is not an effective deterrent for migrants making the dangerousboat journey from Libya. Factors such as poorly-constructed vessels, enginemalfunction, and lack of navigation equipment cause many migrants to arrive inMalta unintentionally. Berhane commented, “In these small boats youcan’t plan your journey.”[96]Nonetheless, he was relieved to reach Malta, saying, “I wouldn’tget back in the boats, the risk. I was so happy to land safely.”[97]Most migrants Human Rights Watch interviewed did not knowabout Malta’s detention policy prior to arriving there. For instance,Ghedi H. said he was 17 when he arrived in Malta from Somalia: “I wassurprised ... I was going in detention, some people told me. I thought when wego to Europe we will get freedom.”[98] Berhane said,“My expectation was that I would come here, apply for asylum and be safe.I didn't expect to be in detention ... I don't understand what benefit thiswill bring to Malta.”[99]Some migrants pointed out that even if they knew there was a detention policyin Malta, their need to flee dangers they faced meant they would have comeanyway. For instance, Labaan X., a Somali boy who came to Malta at age 15,stated:I didn't know Malta existed as a country. I thought it waspart of Italia. I didn't have a choice of where to go. I didn't know aboutdetention, I'd never heard of that. But if I had known, I still had to come. Mycountry, and Libya, I couldn't stay there.[100]Detention without RealisticProspect of RemovalWhen a migrant fails to gain asylum or another form ofprotective status by the end of the initial 12-month detention period, Maltathen detains that person for an additional 6 months (for a maximum of 18 monthsin total), ostensibly in order to remove the person to their country of origin.[101]In reality, Malta cannot return most of these migrants to their countries oforigin and simply releases them after 18 months. This policy appears moredesigned to punish migrants rather than to effectuate their removal.Cherif M., a Chadian migrant who said he was 17 when heentered Malta, but who was not recognized as a minor under Malta’s agedetermination procedure, said he was feeling the toll of extended detention:“If it were to be a month, two months, OK. But now it's getting to 14months, it's a problem…. I was in a school before [in Libya], but now ina locked up place like this, it's not OK.”[102]Edgard O., an Ivorian, said he was rejected from asylum at the first instanceand on appeal: “I went to the interview, told them everything, and I gottwo rejects … I had been there for one year.”[103]Edgard remained in immigration detention for the additional six months ofdetention applicable to rejected asylum seekers. He asked, “I'm going tospend another six months here, and for what?”[104]While Malta has transcribed portions of the EU’s 2008Returns Directive into law,[105]its detention practices pending removal violate EU standards. The 2008 ReturnsDirective, which is binding on Malta, permits member states to detain irregularmigrants for up to six more months pending removal in limited circumstances,for instance, when “there is a risk of absconding,” or the migrant“avoids or hampers the preparation of return or the removalprocess,” with the option of detaining the person for another 12 monthsif the detainee or his or her home government does not cooperate in the removaloperation.[106]Such conditions necessarily require individualized determinations, rather thanblanket detention as is seen in Malta. Moreover, it is not evident why in acountry the size of Malta, migrants actually subject to removal could not bedetained immediately prior to removal rather than held for an arbitrary maximumperiod and then released. Further, the Returns Directive specifically requiresthe member state to provide for “speedy judicial review” of suchdetention, which Malta does not.[107]Malta fails to fulfill the requirement for reasonableprospects of removal. Detention may “only be maintained as long asremoval arrangements are in progress,”[108]and “when it appears that a reasonable prospect of removal no longerexists … detention ceases to be justified.”[109]Returning migrants totheir country of origin can be difficult in the best of circumstances, andespecially complicated in cases where migrants have no documentation. Maltafaces additional obstacles due to the tiny size of its government and itslimited bilateral relationships with the countries of origin of many migrants.Inadequate Procedures for Identification of Vulnerable MigrantsVulnerable migrants, including the elderly, unaccompaniedchildren, families with children, and migrants with mental[110]or physical disabilities, are also subject to mandatory detention upon arrivalin Malta.[111]It is possible for vulnerable migrants to identify themselves and gain releasebefore the 12 or 18-month period has expired.[112]However, in the course of screening incoming migrants, no procedures ensurethat all vulnerable migrants are identified; some of the most vulnerable arealso those who are unable to self-identify to a medical practitioner visitingthe detention centers. Even with self-identification, the procedures for releasecan be ad-hoc and rely on AWAS finding alternative accommodation outside ofdetention centers. People with mental or physical disabilities can also bereleased, but the procedure for identifying them can be ad-hoc.Unaccompanied migrant children, who are initially detainedpending an age determination procedure if they appear over age 12approximately, are released once that age determination has been made andtransferred to group homes (see Section III, below).Though families with children are typically released withina short period, even a short time can be difficult. Nyesom A., a Nigerian womanwho arrived in Malta in 2011 after her husband died during the journey throughLibya, told Human Rights Watch: “I was in detention for two weeks with mytwin girls [who were six months old at the time], I had no option.”[113]Families are detained together in units segregated from single migrants; if awoman is found to be pregnant or becomes pregnant in detention, the family isreleased.[114]Maintaining a presumption of liberty when migrants andasylum seekers arrive by boat would prevent the detention for weeks or monthsof families, children, and those with mental or physical disabilities.Nonetheless, the Maltese government asserts that detention furthers the publicpolicy objective of identifying vulnerable migrants and facilitating theircare, arguing that without detention vulnerable migrants might “abscondthe island or ‘get lost’ in the country” and “would beopen to abuse and exploitation.”[115] There are bettermethods of protecting vulnerable migrants other than detention, such as throughthe provision of adequate social services to migrants in open shelters.Detention Conditions and Impact onMental HealthWhile Malta has taken steps to improve conditions indetention centers in the last two years, the very fact of remaining indetention contributes to declining mental health. In addition, gains made indetention conditions could be eroded if new arrivals result in overcrowding.Malta operates three primary immigration detention facilities,[116]withvarying conditions. Safi Warehouse has 200-300 beds in an open space dividedonly by partitions, with bunk beds. Safi B-Block and Lyster Barracks both haverooms of 16-30 beds, also in bunks. Single men and women are housed separately,as are married couples.A report from theInternational Commission for Jurists (ICJ), based on research from a visit inSeptember 2011 when the facilities were relatively crowded, documented dirtyand inadequate sanitation conditions in Safi Barracks.[117]During our visits in April and May 2012, eachfacility had sanitation and hygiene facilities that seem adequate on thesurface, though may decline in quality during times of overcrowding. Eachfacility also has outdoor recreation areas, though at Lyster Barracks access tothe recreation area is time-limited and on a rota for different parts of thepopulation, with men always able to look down on women when the women areoutside. None of the facilities are fully accessible for people withdisabilities.In 2009, two thirds of the facilities exceeding the maximumdensity recommended for refugee camps in emergencies.[118]Médecins Sans Frontières documented corresponding problems inadequacy of shelter, hygiene, and sanitation.[119] In2010, when there was a lull in incoming migrants, the Maltese authorities wereable to conduct renovations.[120]However, the risk of overcrowding remains. The ICJ report, commenting on aSeptember 2011 visit, documented further overcrowding, in both Safi Barracksfacilities in particular, noting the lack of space for “even a minimallevel of privacy.”[121]Oneway to avoid deterioration in detention conditions would be to end the policyof mandatory detention.ICJ further notes that the location of detention siteswithin military facilities conflicts with the underlying purpose of detention(to prevent unlawful entry) and therefore may violate the ECHR; ICJ calls onguidance from the Committee for the Prevention of Torture to argue that“detained migrants should be held in specifically designed centers inconditions tailored to their legal status and catering for their particularneeds.”[122]Deteriorating Mental HealthEven without overcrowding, prolongeddetention—especially for no clear reason—can have a devastatingeffect on migrants’ and asylum seekers’ mental health. Therespected medical journal The Lancet has published research finding thatlengthy asylum detention in the United States correlates with higher rates ofpost traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, and that detentionexacerbates pre-existing symptoms, including mental trauma sustained whilefleeing torture or persecution.[123]According to medical experts in the United Kingdom, children held inimmigration centers developed “clinically significant emotional andbehavioral problems since being detained.”[124]Drawing on an extensive study from Australia’s Human Rights and EqualOpportunities Commission, the International Detention Coalition finds that:Children who are detained for immigration purposes are at riskof a variety of psychosocial and developmental problems linked to theirdetention experiences … The experience of detention may mimic theexperience of human rights abuses, persecution and terror.… Children andyoung people who are detained for extended periods of time are more likely thanothers to experience feelings of isolation, detachment, and loss of confidence.[125]Lengthy detention caused anxiety for many interviewees inMalta. Dennis M. said, “I spent one year in detention. They didn't freeme for one year.… Every day you're not happy. There are people being senthome every day, so I am tense.”[126]The uncertainty of waiting in detention can be difficult. Aminata H.,from Ivory Coast, said, “Detention is not easy. After a year, they havetold us nothing, whether they are going to repatriate us or not.”[127]Interviewees asserted that detention caused their overallmental state to deteriorate. Maka, who said he was detained for 10 months,said, “Hal Far [Hermes Block] was very bad. I was going crazy in thatplace. It was not good for my head.”[128] AatifaT., who had spent 14 months in detention when we interviewed her, said,“When inside, your mind is always closed. We can't open our mind to newthings.… For your brain this is not good.”[129]Hakim, from Eritrea, observed, "Many who spent time in detention, we don'twant to talk about it," adding that the trauma makes it “verydifficult to keep [one’s] head straight.”[130] Celestesaid, “The issues, they are from detention. When you get out, you arecured.”[131]Many of the migrants and asylum seekers arriving in Maltaexperienced trauma before fleeing their home countries. Others experiencedtraumatic events during their often months-long migration across the Sahara,through Libya, and over the Mediterranean in unseaworthy boats. In addition tohaving its own negative effects on mental health, prolonged detention canexacerbate that prior trauma.The arbitrary nature of the detention and the lack ofclarity around procedures for liberty can exacerbate mental distress. AliKonate, a migrant community leader, told Human Rights Watch: "I see manymental problems. People despair because they don't understand what is going on,they are rejected, etcetera."[132]Many people in detention become depressed.[133]Amina A., from Somalia, was detained at Hermes Block when Human Rights Watchinterviewed her: “I went to a mental institution for 14 days becauseevery day I cried, I was more depressed. That’s where I had themiscarriage.… [Now, back in detention] I take sleeping pills everynight.”[134]Malta provides some access to mental health care for those in detention,including stays in a psychiatric hospital, but this does not address theunderlying connection between detention and deterioration in mental health.Medhane E., an Eritrean migrant who has sought help frommedical staff, said, “I have thought of hurting myself ... pouring gasover myself and lighting on fire.”[135] Kelile T., whoreported he was 17 years old when he arrived in Malta in 2011, and who wasdetained at Safi when Human Rights Watch interviewed him, spent 15 days in amental health facility. He said, “I hate my life. These people, all big,big, not same as me. This is prison … I take medicine now, for sleep. Nomedicine, I can't sleep … my mind is no good, it is very hard.… Ican't, I can't ... this is a hard place. I need a free place.”[136]III. Treatment of Unaccompanied MigrantChildrenMalta detains all age-disputed cases pending agedetermination, and applies a very low threshold for disputing the age ofchildren. As a result, children may be detained for weeks or months, despitealternative available facilities. During detention, children are detained withadults, without any accommodation for their young age, and with no access toschool. Once determined to be children—and released to otheraccommodation—children do not receive adequate legal representation.Under international and European standards, unaccompanied children should neverbe detained for reasons related to irregular entry, and pending age determinationthe person claiming to be a child should be treated as such until thedetermination is complete.Detention ofUnaccompanied Migrant ChildrenMalta detains all unaccompanied children whose status aschildren is in question, pending age determination. The age determinationprocedure can take some months, leaving children in detention for long periods.Among those we interviewed who were children at the time of the interview orwho were children upon arrival in Malta between 2008 and 2011, the maximum timein detention was seven months (for a child in 2011). Among those we intervieweddetained between 2008 and 2011 who Malta ultimately determined to be children,the average time in detention was 3.4 months.[137] A2009 study by the Maltese National Contact Point of the European MigrationNetwork (funded in part by Maltese government funds) found an average detentiontime of 1.6 months for the 10 unaccompanied minors in their focus group.[138]International law states that unaccompanied children shouldnot be criminalized for reasons related to their immigration status or illegalentry,[139]andarticle 37(b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) mandates thatthe detention of children “shall be used only as a measure of lastresort.” Furthermore, the Commissioner for Human Rights for the Councilof Europe has stated that, “as a principle, migrant children should notbe subjected to detention.”[140]Best practices indicate that, pending age determination, theperson claiming to be a child should provisionally be treated as such.[141]Malta should treat children pending age determination as children, and detainthem only as a measure of last resort. While placing migrants pending agedetermination in the unaccompanied minor facilities is not appropriate, thereis no reason why they could not be released to alternate facilities to preventprolonged detention of children.Low Threshold for Disputing AgeMalta’s trigger for questioning the age individualsclaim to be, and thus detaining them, is low: interviewees reported seeingchildren as young as 12 detained while undergoing age determination procedures.[142]When migrants arrive by boat in Malta, the Malta Police Immigration Sectiontakes virtually all of the passengers to detention.[143] Evenif unaccompanied children identify themselves as children during this initialcontact, they will most likely still be taken to detention. According to theAgency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) and Detention Services, onlyage disputed cases are detained, with those who are “visibly”children released from detention within 24 hours[144] andplaced in the care of AWAS.[145]In practice, however, the cut-off for those who are “visibly”children is around 12 to 14 years old, with children who appear older presumedto be adults—and detained—until an age determination is carriedout.[146]For example, on April 30, 2012, Human Rights Watch met withthree boys detained in an immigration facility who said they had been takenstraight into detention after arriving by boat two days earlier. Two of theboys, aged 15 and 16, were visibly children according to Human RightsWatch’s assessment: we were able to walk down a crowded hallway insidethe detention facility and identify them by sight, having no previous knowledgeof children detained in that facility. On the day of arrival, all three boyssaid they told the arresting authorities their birthdate during a routine datacollection, but none were provided with information about procedures toestablish that they are minors.[147]Their experience is similar to that described by otherinterviewees. Bello E., who said he was 16 when his boat was intercepted nearMalta, reported, “Before we knew it, we were in detention … I triedto tell I was 16. They didn’t accept it, they sent me back into Safi[detention center] … I had not committed a crime. Why was I inprison?”[148]Labaan X., a Somali who said he came to Malta in 2008 when he was 15 years old,and was 18 years old when we interviewed him, described to Human Rights Watchwhat happened after arriving: “I got off the boat and went straight todetention. I said I was a child. But I spent three months in detention beforethey put me in a home for young people.”[149]Detaining Unaccompanied Children with Unrelated AdultsDetained migrant boys are routinely held, pending agedetermination, in overcrowded conditions with unrelated adult men. The Conventionon the Rights of the Child (CRC) indicates that, in exceptional cases wherechildren are detained, they should receive care appropriate to their age,including ability to contact family, appropriate medical treatment andpsychological counseling, and access to education.[150]Detained children do not have access to education or any other care related totheir age.The Convention on theRights of the Child, as well as the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights oblige states parties to separate adults from children indetention,[151]and the Committee on the Rights of the Child reinforces that this obligationspecifically applies to migrant children in detention.[152]The European Court of Human Rights held in MubilanzilaMayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v. Belgium that the prolonged detention of anunaccompanied child jointly with adults amounted to inhuman or degradingtreatment, in part because such detention conditions were not adapted to theextreme vulnerability of the unaccompanied child, causing “considerabledistress” and “serious psychological effects.”[153]Seventeen-year-old Stéphane K., an Ivorian who was 16when he arrived in Malta in 2011, was detained in one room with 200-300 adultmen. “The room wasn't that big—we had bunk beds,” he toldHuman Rights Watch.[154]Kibreab A., an Eritrean who arrived in Malta at the age of 17 in 2009, said hewas detained with unrelated adults for five months before being moved to a children’sfacility. He complained to Human Rights Watch that the room in detention wassmall for the 50 people that were staying there.[155]Children may be exposed to periodic violence in detentionfacilities when detained with adults.[156]While some children reported that they did not feel unsafe while detained withadults, others reported instances of exploitation and violence. Ghedi H., whowas detained with adult men in 2008 when he was 17 years old, said,“Sometimes … adults would take my food because there’s notenough.”[157]Abdi M., a Somali migrant who was detained at the same time as Ghedi, and whowas 17 years old when detained, related what happened to him at the Safidetention facility:Every day a big man from Mali came and said, “Give meyour food.” And one day I said no, and he hit me. I was out on the floor[unconscious] for half an hour. I told the soldiers but they said, “Wedon’t care.” No one helped me, I just cried and went to sleep.[158]During Human Rights Watch’s visit to Maltese detentionfacilities in April 2012, we met with three boys who were housed with adults ina detention center for single men. Two of the boys, who reported their ages as15 and 16 years old, were visibly scared. Amr S., the 15 year old, said,“It’s very difficult to live here at Safi. I’m afraid to livewhere people might hit me… I don’t have anyone to take care ofme.”[159]Edgard O., a 26-year-old Ivorian man who was detained in the same facility asthe boys, commented: “To be honest with you, I was a little bit concernedto see they were here [the boys.] Fifteen years old—he doesn’tdeserve this.”[160]Lengthy and IncompleteAge Determination Procedures That Prolong DetentionAge determination procedures in Malta can take severalmonths, leaving children in detention pending the outcome. AWAS has, to itscredit, instituted a relatively sophisticated age determination procedure inthe roughly 10-year period that unaccompanied children have been arriving byboat. Nonetheless, the procedure needs several improvements—including a reductionin processing time (including the time taken for medical testing), increasedprovision of information to incoming children, and a process by which childrencan be released from detention pending age determination.According to the CRC, age determination should beprioritized immediately after arrival in the country, and that the bestinterests of the child should be a guiding principle in these proceedings.[161]Furthermore, children should never be detained for reasons related to theirimmigration status. Malta’s lengthy age determination procedures, incombination with routine detention of children in age disputed cases and lowthreshold for disputing age, stands in opposition to these principles.Labaan, the Somali boy who arrived in Malta at 15 years oldin 2008, said: “I had to wait for three months in detention. Two monthsbefore they [AWAS age determination officials] questioned me.”[162]Kibreab A., who was 17 when he arrived in Malta from Eritrea in 2009,told us he was detained for five months before being released to achildren’s home.[163]After leaving the Ivory Coast and traveling for several months, StéphaneK., an Ivorian boy, told Human Rights Watch he was 16 when he reached Malta in2011. He was detained for seven months awaiting age determination, which hedescribed as deeply disturbing: “For someone [at that age] to be indetention, it's not normal. Seven months of detention, it's not normal. Shutin, I can't go out. It's not normal.”[164]An NGO staff member who routinely works within the detentioncenters told Human Rights Watch that in 2008 and 2009 some asylum procedures actuallymoved more quickly than age determination procedures. Accordingly, some adultasylum seekers who arrived at the same time (and even on the same boat) aschildren awaiting age determination were released from detention while thechildren remained behind bars.[165]This could have the effect of discouraging children from disclosing their agefor fear that it could extend their period of detention.Age determination in Malta is conducted by an age assessmentteam from AWAS composed of a social worker, psychologist, and a coordinator.[166]Most unaccompanied children arrive without identity papers, such as passportsand birth certificates. Maltese authorities rely on medical testing—inparticular, bone x-rays—where initial interviews by the age assessmentteam are inconclusive.[167]However, medical examinations used to determine age are problematic becausethey are subject to margins of error of up to five years.[168] Inaddition, radiological testing is unnecessarily intrusive; the SeparatedChildren in Europe Program, a coalition of Save the Children and UNHCR, assertsthat such testing must be avoided and non-invasive medical testing, such asphysical development assessments, should be used instead.[169]In cases where Maltese authorities turn to medical testing, they use the resultas one factor in a multidisciplinary assessment.[170]In Malta, medical testing can add months to the agedetermination process.[171]Christophe G., a 17-year-old Ivorian who arrived in Malta when he was 16 in2011 and spent a total of six months in detention, reported: “After the[x-ray] machine, I waited [in detention] for one or two months more, it was onemonth after that that my friend left, and then one month more, so two monthsmore total.”[172]The Committee on the Rights of the Child emphasizes that, when children are inimmigration detention, “all efforts, including acceleration of relevantprocess, should be made to allow for the immediate release.”[173]On a more positive note, a group of children was detainedfor a very short period in early 2012. Dalmar H., Nadif K., Korfa A., andErasto M., all Somali boys aged 17, said they were detained for two weeks whenthey arrived in the same boat in January 2012.[174]However, fewer migrants cross the Mediterranean during the winter months,because of worse weather conditions than in the summer; this is notrepresentative of a fundamental change in Malta’s policies.Despite the relatively quick release of children in January2012, there does not appear to be any permanent detention policy change.[175]AWAS has made clear attempts to take policy steps to shorten the process,including by setting internal benchmarks for preliminary interviews withchildren within 10 working days of arrival, and by participating in traininginitiatives through common European mechanisms.[176] Butas long as Malta continues to detain children pending age determination, anydelay in the procedure prolongs the violation of children’s rights.Lack of Screening, Reliance on Self-identification, and Lack of Informationon ProceduresChildren lack adequate information about the agedetermination process (including whether documents are accepted and whetherthere is an appeal). Some migrants who request an age determination procedureare seemingly ignored: interviewees reported telling authorities they wereminors but never receiving age determination. Other children never request anage determination because they lack information on the procedure.For example, Perry O., a Ghanaian migrant, said he traveledto Malta shortly before he turned 17in 2008. He reported that hetold the detention guards that he was 16 years old, but he was never interviewedby AWAS or given a medical test to determine his age. He did not know if theguards ever reported his claim to AWAS.[177] Chris K., fromNigeria, said he was 17 when he arrived in 2007. He reported: “I toldthem I was a child but they still put me in detention for 10 months. I told thepolice when I came in.”[178]Like Perry, Chris said he never received an interview with AWAS and does notknow what happened to his claim.A number of interviewees chose not to inform authoritiesthat they were children, often on the advice of fellow migrants. Ousmane H.,from Mali, said: “I came when I was 17. I spoke no English, I had no-onewho could understand me. I was told by a Somali guy not to reveal myage.”[179]Bello, a Nigerian migrant who said he reached Malta when he was 16 years old,had a similar story: “The captain told all the people on my boat not tosay we were below 18.”[180]Bello later tried to report his real age:Before we knew it we were in detention. They just recordyour details, you don't know what we're supposed to do…. When I gotinformation from immigration, I rushed back to say I'm 16. I went back to thesecurity to tell them I was a child … They didn't accept it; they sent meback into Safi [the detention facility].[181]There is no appeal of the age determination process withinAWAS (and while an appeal to the Immigration Appeals Board is possible, it israrely done), nor is there any clear guidance on whether documents areaccepted.[182]Cherif M. reported that he was 17 when he arrived in Malta in 2011. He waitedone month in detention for his initial interview with AWAS, he said, and wasrejected: “A friend faxed my photocopied birth certificate from Chad.AWAS wouldn’t take it.”[183]The government should do more to provide children withreliable information about the age determination procedure. Children receive noguidance on the content of the procedure, whether documents will be useful, orwhether they can appeal. Malta has taken considerable steps in providinginformation to migrants about the process for asylum, including by conductinginformation sessions to every incoming migrant. It could easily do the same forthe age determination process.Lack of Legal Representation in Asylum Proceedings and inChallenging DetentionUnaccompanied migrant children in Malta receive little or nolegal representation, either in requesting asylum or in challenging detentionin age-disputed cases. The Maltese government relies heavily onnon-governmental and inter-governmental organizations, including the JesuitRefugee Service and UNHCR, to provide counseling to unaccompanied migrant childrenand other vulnerable migrants in detention. However, this is insufficient tomeet the government’s obligations to provide children in asylumproceedings with legal representation.Children involved in asylum procedures should, in additionto the appointment of a guardian, be provided with legal representation,according to the CRC.[184]The lack of representation in first instance proceedings means it is harder forchildren to understand the proceedings and present their case. For example,Labaan said he struggled to understand the asylum procedure: “I had threeinterviews with two different people. It made me confused.”[185]Each unaccompanied child in Malta is, at the conclusion ofthe age determination procedure, assigned a guardian when the Minister forJustice, Dialogue, and the Family issues a care order for the child, at thedirection of the Children and Young Persons Advisory Board.[186] Accordingto the CRC, the guardian’s job should be much broader than that of alegal representative (as above, for asylum proceedings or to challengedetention): the guardian, who need not be a lawyer, should be consulted on allactions taken for the child in order to ensure that the child’s“legal, social, health, psychological, material and educational needs areadequately covered.[187]Nonetheless, this is not a substitute for legal representation.The Maltese government has made considerable strides inasylum processing in the 10 or so years since it started receiving significantnumbers of asylum applications, and now has one of the fastest processing timesand lowest backlogs in the EU. Simultaneously, those responsible for firstinstance decisions in the Office of the Refugee Commissioner have undergonetraining on the specific needs of children seeking asylum through theEU-sponsored European Asylum Curriculum, and the Refugee Commissioner has urgedhis staff to view children’s cases in light of child-specific forms ofpersecution and appropriate credibility standards. While the Maltese governmentis to be commended on these steps, children applying for asylum still do notenjoy the requisite assistance.As noted above, in meeting with Human Rights Watch, theRefugee Commissioner stressed that Malta has one of the highest rates of asylumapplications per capita in the industrialized world—20.1 applicants per1,000 inhabitants—and that even those not granted asylum still tend toreceive other forms of protection. He pointed to this as a reason why it is notnecessary for all migrants to be provided with legal representation in thefirst instance. [188]While this may be a valid argument for adults, provision of legalrepresentation to unaccompanied migrant children is required by law, andnecessary to protect the interests of this vulnerable group. Suchrepresentation is unlikely to be financially burdensome: there areapproximately less than 100 unaccompanied children who claim asylum each year.Likewise, unaccompanied migrant children who are detainedfor illegal entry do not receive legal representation. According to the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights in Louled Massoud, the Maltese legal system lacksthe necessary “effective and speedy remedy” for challenging thelawfulness of immigration detention. Article 37(d) of the CRC mandates thatchildren deprived of their liberty should have prompt access to legalassistance, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasized thatthis specifically applies to unaccompanied migrant children in immigrationdetention.[189]IV. ConclusionMalta detains an average of 1,500 migrants per year inviolation of international law. The migrants detained are overwhelmingly poor,fleeing violence and conflict, or in search of a better life. Yet when theyreach Malta, an entrance point for the European Union, they are detained for upto 18 months, despite the fact that 93 percent of them are asylum seekers. Evenvulnerable migrants—including children, those with mental and physicaldisabilities, and the elderly—are detained.There is no evident justification for this prolongeddetention, and during their detention migrants have no meaningful opportunityfor judicial review in order to require the state to show such justification.The automated, indiscriminate, and blanket detention policy does not determigrants from coming to Malta: most migrants who arrive by boat, typicallycrossing the Mediterranean in unseaworthy vessels with insufficient navigationsystems, are not aiming to reach Malta but instead intend to travel to Italy.Unaccompanied migrant children can travel for months in hazardousconditions before reaching Malta. Yet these resilient and resourceful childrenare not spared detention in Malta: rather, they are locked up for weeks ormonths until their age determination procedures are concluded. During thistime, they are detained with unrelated adults, a further violation ofinternational standards on detention of children.Among those we interviewed who were found to be children inage determination proceedings, the average length of time spent in detentionwas 3.4 months. Children should only be detained as a last resort, and for theshortest period possible. Malta’s age determination proceedings must berestructured to prevent extended detention of children. Crucially, anyone whomakes an application for age determination must be presumed a child until theoutcome of the proceedings, and must be released from detention.Malta must revise its migrant detention policies for adultand child migrants alike, and end the continued mental stress imposed onmigrants kept in prolonged detention. Maltese laws should allow detention ofmigrants only in exceptional circumstances, with individualized determinations,and access to procedures to challenge detention.AcknowledgementsThis report was researched and written by Alice Farmer, researcherin the Children’s Rights Division.
