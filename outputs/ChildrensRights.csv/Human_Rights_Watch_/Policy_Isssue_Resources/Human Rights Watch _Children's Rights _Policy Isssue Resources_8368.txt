Matthew N., also17, was prosecuted in adult court for stealing a printer from the back porch ofa house. The experiences of Oliver and Matthew—removed from the juvenilejustice system as teenagers and tried in adult court for nonviolentcrimes—are far from unique.Florida transfers more children out of the juvenile systemand into adult court than any other state. In the last five years alone, morethan 12,000 juvenile crime suspects in Florida were transferred to the adult courtsystem. New statistics developed by Human Rights Watch based on officialFlorida state data show that more than 60 percent of the juveniles Floridatransferred to adult court during this period were charged with nonviolentfelonies. Only 2.7 percent were prosecuted for murder.Whether a particular youth accused of a particular crime inFlorida ends up in adult court is in an important sense arbitrary. The new datashow that nearly 98 percent of the juveniles in adult court in Florida end upthere pursuant to the state’s “direct file” statute, whichgives prosecutors unfettered discretion to move a wide range of juvenile casesto adult court (including any 16- and 17-year-old accused of a felony), with noinvolvement by a judge whatsoever. The data show that this discretion is beingexercised differently by prosecutors in different judicial circuits withinFlorida. Too often, as detailed below, the same crime is treated differentlydepending on the predilections of the prosecutor where the crime occurs:different judicial circuit, different outcome. And there is evidence thatracial bias is affecting that exercise of discretion with respect to certaincrimes.Most states in the United States do not allow for directfile. International law requires that children, including those accused ofcrimes, be treated as children. And for good reason. Neuroscience, recent USSupreme Court decisions, and a by-now large and growing literature show thatchildren, including 16- and 17-year-old juveniles, are different and inimportant respects less culpable than adults who commit the same crimes, andmore amenable to rehabilitation, a key objective that the juvenile system isdesigned to achieve. At present, however, while teens 17 and under cannotlegally vote, drink, or buy cigarettes in Florida, they can be branded asfelons for life.Florida’s direct file law is a remnant of the“super-predator” panic of the late 1980s, the fear that America wasbecoming prey to a new generation of particularly depraved and violentteenagers. The panic was born of an overreaction to a nationwide spike injuvenile crime that has long since abated. Even the professor who coined theterm now acknowledges that the super-predator prediction “was neverfulfilled.”Florida’s direct file law is not effectively servingpublic safety. Indeed, recent studies link transfers of juveniles to adultcourt to increases, not decreases, in recidivism. And, as this report shows,“direct file” is having negative, at times devastating, effects onthe lives of thousands of children and their families.Human Rights Watch spoke to over 100 youth and familymembers of youth charged directly in adult court by Florida’sprosecutors. Young people described feeling confused and abandoned once inadult court. Many encountered violence upon entering adult jails and prisons.In nearly every case documented in this report, they pled guilty to feloniesthat will mark them forever without having a full understanding of therepercussions. Some of them were unable, even months and years after enteringtheir guilty pleas, to explain the process that resulted in their criminalconvictions.Florida should reverse course and adopt an approach groundedmore firmly in fact and reason. Florida’s legislature should start by eliminating“direct file” and instead require that all decisions to transferjuveniles to adult court be made by a judge after a hearing, with a strongpresumption that all children 17 and under should remain in the juvenilesystem.**             *I felt like my life was gone.—John C., prosecuted as an adult at age 16, May 29,2013Many people know that children in Florida can be tried asadults for serious crimes of violence. Lionel Tate made headlines in 2001 when,at age 12, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole forthe killing of a 6-year-old neighbor. Far less widely appreciated is that Taterepresents a tiny minority: far more common are cases—like Oliver’sand Matthew’s—in which Florida children are tried in adult courtfor nonviolent crimes. Of the 1,535 children tried in adult court in Florida in2012-13, 865 had been accused of committing nonviolent felonies; another 54were sent to adult court to face misdemeanor or other non-felony charges.As noted above, roughly 98 percent (98.3 percent in 2012-13)of juvenile cases transferred to adult criminal court in Florida in recentyears ended up there pursuant to the state’s direct file statute. Thestatute gives prosecutors unfettered discretion to charge 16- and 17-year-oldsaccused of any felony in adult court and to charge 14- and 15-year-olds asadults with respect to certain specific felonies.None of the children prosecuted under Florida’s directfile statute have the benefit of hearings where they can challenge the decisionto transfer them to the adult system before an impartial decision-maker. Thestatute does not give judges any role to play in the decision to pursue directfile; a juvenile court judge cannot stop a prosecutor from charging a child inadult court, and an adult court judge has no power to refuse to hear a case andsend it to juvenile court, regardless of how unsuitable the case is forcriminal court. Florida fails to provide even the most basic ofsafeguards—a fair hearing —when determining the fate of its children.Rather than being prosecuted in the juvenile system, whichis intended to be rehabilitative and to balance the needs of society and thebest interests of the child, such children are shunted off to the adultcriminal justice system, which values punishment over everything else. They areplaced in adult jails, deprived of age-appropriate programs, and subjected toharsh sentences and the life-altering consequences of adult felony convictions.Many teens find out they are going to be tried as adultsonly when they are taken from juvenile detention to an adult jail, where manybecome victims of and witnesses to violence. Some go through the entire adultcourt process—from arrest and bond hearing to guilty plea—withoutfully understanding what is happening.The decision to deny a child access to the rehabilitativeservices offered by the juvenile justice system and subject him or her to themore punitive adult system is, in most cases, made by the prosecutor, who is anadverse party in the proceedings and has no obligation to consider thedefendant’s status as a child. While Florida’s still on-the-booksbut rarely used judicial waiver statute sets out eight factors, including“the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the child,” that a judgeis required to consider before ordering transfer to adult court, the directfile statute empowering prosecutors contains no such factors.Prosecutors are not even required to state why they are choosing to charge achild in adult court. Their decision is final and cannot be challenged.As noted above, new statistics developed by Human RightsWatch for this report show that the overwhelming power Florida has handed toprosecutors is playing out in arbitrary and unjust ways. Florida’sjudicial circuits send arrested children to adult courts at vastly differentrates. This variation cannot be explained by the seriousness of offenses, thesize of circuit youth populations, or other data Human Rights Watch examined.Even more disturbingly, once children are charged in adult court, some Floridacircuits impose severe adult penalties at frequencies that are out ofproportion to the levels of youth crime in those circuits.Statewide, Florida is also treating its black male youthmore harshly than their white counterparts. Black boys make up 27.2 percent ofchildren arrested for crime, but account for 51.4 percent of youth sent toadult court; whereas white boys make up 28 percent of children arrested andaccount for only 24.4 percent of youth tried in adult court. A simpleexplanation might be that the crimes of black boys are more serious than thoseof white boys; Human Rights Watch looked into transfer rates for differentcategories of crime in an effort to find out. While for some crimes thetransfer rates are similar, for others there is a marked disparity,particularly in certain judicial circuits. The 13th Circuit, forexample, transferred 8.8 percent of white youths arrested for drug felonies toadult court; for black youth arrested for the same crimes, that figure was 30.1percent, more than three times higher. The available data do not includeimportant details of the cases that may partly account for the disparities,including the drug quantities involved and the criminal histories of theoffenders, but the consistency and size of the racial disparities nonethelessare of serious concern.The racial disparities and the variations between circuitsare disturbing evidence of the unchecked discretion of Florida’sprosecutors. They are also problematic because the youth charged inFlorida’s adult courts suffer extraordinarily severe consequences. Nearlyevery child charged and convicted in adult court ends up with an adult felonyrecord that will haunt him or her for life. Many will serve time inFlorida’s adult prisons. Even those who are charged in adult court butultimately have their cases dismissed discover that their adult arrest recordshaunt them when they apply for jobs or housing. The permanent consequences of afelony conviction or a felony arrest record are difficult for any person tolive with, but this is particularly so for a child. Those with convictions arebarred by law from many types of employment, and suffer many otherdeprivations, including permanent loss of the right to vote.The broad discretion the direct file statute givesprosecutors also has a corrupting effect on the juvenile system—HumanRights Watch learned that prosecutors in some jurisdictions are using thethreat of direct file in order to obtain guilty pleas in juvenile court,thereby discouraging defendants from exercising their right to present adefense and avoid incarceration in juvenile facilities.Once they are charged directly in adult court byFlorida’s prosecutors, children are moved to adult jails pendingdisposition of their cases, and often serve their sentences in adultfacilities. While Florida law requires that they be kept separate from adults,the experience of adult jail or prison is still traumatic. Many intervieweesreported that violence was prevalent in adult jails and prisons. Furthermore,adult facilities are simply not designed to house children—intervieweessuffered from inadequate time outdoors, a lack of appropriate counseling, andwere prevented from visiting privately in person with their families (some wereinstead limited to video phone calls with their loved ones). They also notedthat corrections officers lacked the skills or patience required to deal withadolescents. Additionally, the long distances between the prisons that housedthem and their hometowns meant that family visits were rare.The US Supreme Court, in a series of four recent cases, hasunderscored what every adult knows—that children are different. Theirbodies, personalities, and brains are in the process of maturing, which meansthey are uniquely suited to the rehabilitative programs offered in the juvenilejustice system. Although they can be held accountable for crimes, theirpunishment should take into account their diminished culpability, because theyare less able to reason logically, to withstand peer pressure, to predictfuture outcomes in order to guide their behavior, and to make carefuldecisions. This extends to 16- and 17-year-olds. One judge who has presidedover juvenile court for 14 years told Human Rights Watch, “I’vebeen here long enough to understand that when someone is 16 and I ask them whythey did it and they say ‘I don’t know,’ I believethem.”This understanding is also reflected in international law,which has long recognized that children are fundamentally different fromadults. International law requires that children receive special protection inall proceedings, including criminal proceedings. To comply with internationalstandards, any criminal process that a child is subjected to must take intoaccount the fact that children are uniquely capable of rehabilitation.Some children are charged directly in adult court for theirfirst offense. Others are subjected to direct file after a series of offensesadjudicated in juvenile court. In neither case is the unfettered power ofprosecutors to charge them as adults warranted. Irrespective of any prioroffenses, international human rights law requires that children receivetreatment tailored to their development and well-being until they reach the ageof 18. Even repeat offenders are entitled to that basic safeguard. There arepractical reasons for exempting children from adult procedures and sanctions aswell. Research shows that criminal behaviors peak in the teenage years, thendecline rapidly and continue to slowly decline in late adulthood.Florida should stop shunting children off to adult court toface processes they do not understand, to spend time in adult facilities notsuited to children, and to serve adult sentences that bring a lifetime ofconsequences that they cannot fully grasp. Florida should re-examine itsdecision to give prosecutors sole authority to take children away from thejuvenile system, where their parents can continue to play a role in theirlives, in favor of placing them in the adult system, where parents have verylittle power and extremely limited contact with their children. The victims ofcrimes committed by children deserve justice, but children, including teens,can be held accountable without subjecting them to treatment as harsh as thatmeted out by the state of Florida.RecommendationsTo the FloridaLegislatureRepeal statutory authorization for direct file and insteadrequire that all decisions to transfer children (youth 17 and under) tothe adult system be made by a judge based on testimony and evidencepresented in a hearing, with a statutory presumption that they remainin the juvenile system. The hearing should include consideration of thejuvenile’s amenability to rehabilitation.To the extent youth 17 and under continue to be prosecutedin adult court, stop their pretrial confinement in adult jails and insteadallow them to remain in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.Make sealing or expungement of criminal records automaticupon completion of sentence for crimes committed by people 17 and under.To Elected State AttorneysUntil direct file is eliminated, apply the discretionconferred on prosecutors by Florida law to stop the practice of directfile.To ensure that prosecutions are conducted in a way thattakes into account the specific characteristics of children and thedesirability of promoting their rehabilitation, create specialized unitsof prosecutors tasked with prosecuting all cases in which the suspect is17 or younger at the time of the offense.Provide training to all attorneys prosecuting juveniles inFlorida in how to deal with juveniles, including information aboutadolescent brain development.To Juvenile Court JudgesUntil direct file is eliminated, order state attorneys toindicate their intent to directly charge a juvenile in adult court atleast 5 days prior to filing the case in adult court in order to givedefense attorneys an opportunity to explain the procedure to theirjuvenile clients in a manner that the clients can comprehend.Until direct file is eliminated, provide an on-the-recordexplanation to children subject to possible direct file of what it is andwhat to expect if they go to adult court.Once direct file is eliminated, provide an on-the-recordexplanation to children subject to possible judicial waiver hearings ofwhat those hearings entail and what to expect if they go to adult court.To Circuit Court JudgesExercise all possible discretion to allow children chargedas adults to remain in the community, or in the custody of the juvenilejustice system if custody is required, rather than in adult jail pendingtrial.Tailor criminal procedures to children’s capacity tounderstand as well as to their needs and rehabilitative potential.When sentencing children convicted as adults, take intoaccount the child’s developmental status and capacity forrehabilitation.To the Office of Court AdministrationRequire all judges who preside over criminal cases to attendtrainings in adolescent brain development and in how to address the needsof children tried as adults.To Public DefendersRequire all lawyers to attend trainings in adolescentbrain development and in how to work with juvenile clients.Create specialized units to handle cases of childrensubject to the jurisdiction of adult courts so that felony lawyers candevelop expertise in dealing with juvenile clients.To the Department of Juvenile JusticeCollect and make publicly available data on the dispositionof cases where defendants are prosecuted in adult court for crimescommitted while 17 or younger.Collect data on how often cases that are considered fordirect file result in guilty pleas in juvenile court.Use all power and authority available to the agency tolimit the number of youth held in adult facilities or tried in adultcourts.To the Department of CorrectionsRequire all probation officers to attend trainings inadolescent brain development and in how to interact with children convictedof crimes.MethodologyThis report is based on interviews and correspondence with107 individuals and relatives of individuals who were sent directly to adultcourt by Florida’s prosecutors, pursuant to Florida’s direct filestatute, for crimes committed when they were 17 or younger. Human Rights Watchinterviewed 42 of the 107 in person and three via phone. Of the people weinterviewed in person, 23 were incarcerated at the time we spoke with them. Wecorresponded with the 62 remaining persons.Human Rights Watch identified individuals prosecuted inadult court by searching the Florida Department of Corrections offenderdatabase, available at http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/obis_request.html. HumanRights Watch sent a letter and survey, the templates of which are included inAppendix A of this report, to 656 incarcerated individuals and probationerswhose dates of offense and dates of birth indicated that they were likelyprosecuted in adult court for offenses committed prior to age 18. The lettersasked people to respond only if their cases had been filed in adult court by aprosecutor, rather than transferred there by a judge or after indictment by agrand jury. Several child advocates and defense attorneys also distributed thesurveys to an unknown number of children they knew to have been sent directlyto adult court by a Florida prosecutor.Of the people who received surveys, 75 responded. Of those75, Human Rights Watch was able to interview 11 in person. Nine of those wereincarcerated at Sumter Correctional Institution when they spoke to Human RightsWatch. Human Rights Watch interviewed two additional people at Sumter who hadnot filled out surveys. At the time Human Rights Watch was conductinginterviews, Sumter and Lancaster Correctional Institution were the two Floridaprisons with the highest number of inmates aged 17 or younger. Lancasterauthorities refused to give Human Rights Watch access to any incarceratedindividuals. While the prison administration at Sumter did allow Human RightsWatch to conduct interviews at the facility, they would not allow interviewswith any incarcerated people who were in solitary confinement. Ten incarceratedyouth who responded to the Human Rights Watch survey were in solitaryconfinement on the days interviews were conducted, and were thus unavailable.Four other survey respondents we interviewed were being heldunder house arrest, were on probation, or had completed their sentences. Ofthese, we interviewed three in their homes and one at a coffee shop.Two individuals we interviewed came to our attention aftertheir stories appeared in the media. We interviewed one at her place ofbusiness, the other by telephone. Finally, 13 children who were represented bythe Ninth Judicial Circuit Office of the Public Defender and incarcerated atthe Orange County Jail agreed to speak to Human Rights Watch but had notcompleted written surveys.Human Rights Watch also spoke to 42 prosecutors, judges,defense attorneys, child advocates, and juvenile system probation officers whohad been involved in cases prosecuted under Florida’s direct filestatute. Human Rights Watch attempted to speak to adult system probationofficers, repeatedly contacting several regional probation offices as well asthe Florida Department of Corrections, which oversees adult felony probation,in an effort to speak to adult system probation officers who had supervisedyouth who had been subject to Florida’s direct file statute. We receivedno response.This report focuses on Florida because it was among thefirst states to give prosecutors, rather than judges, the discretion to decidewhen a child should be charged as an adult. Historically, Florida has chargedchildren as adults at a higher rate than other states. Thirteen US states reportthe rate at which children are removed from the juvenile system and prosecutedin the adult criminal system. Of these 13 states, Florida charged children asadults at a rate of 164.7 per 100,000 juveniles from 2003-2008, almost twicethe rate of Oregon, which came in second.In this report, in line with international law, the terms“child” and “children” refer to a person or personsbelow the age of 18. We use the term “young person” to refer tothose who were older than 18 at the time of their interviews or correspondencewith Human Rights Watch but had been prosecuted in adult criminal courts forcrimes they committed as children. “Transfer” refers to thepractice of removing a child from juvenile court jurisdiction and prosecutinghim or her in adult court, regardless of whether the child gets to the adultsystem through direct file, judicial waiver, or some other process. Finally, inthis report, we use the phrase “charged directly in adult court” asa shorthand for “charged in adult court pursuant to Florida’sdirect file statute.”Florida comprises 67 counties, which are organized into 20judicial circuits. Each circuit organizes its own criminal and juvenile courts,and has an elected state attorney, or prosecutor, and an elected public defender.Human Rights Watch was not able to interview people in every county or circuit.In selecting which jurisdictions to visit, we focused on those circuits withthe highest rates of juveniles prosecuted in adult court, but also aimed toinclude both densely and sparsely populated circuits.All individuals we interviewed about their experienceprovided informed consent to participate in the research. Interviews at SumterCorrectional Institution and the Orange County Jail were conducted in private,outside of the hearing of jail and prison staff. An attorney from the NinthCircuit Public Defender’s Office was present for the interviews conductedin Orange County Jail, since the majority of the children interviewed there hadpending cases and were advised not to speak without their lawyer present. Weexplained to each interviewee that participation in the interview wascompletely voluntary, that we could not offer any legal advice or otherassistance, and that the interviewee could stop the interview at any time. Wegave no incentives to interviewees. One individual declined to be interviewed.We ended a second interview shortly after it began when the child beinginterviewed gave indications that he did not understand what was happening orwhat the purpose of the interview was.All interviewees were given the choice of using their realnames or a pseudonym. Due to the serious stigma of arrest and conviction, andthe possibility that at least some of the children and young people interviewedmight not know if their cases could be eligible for sealing, expungement, orpardon in the future, we decided to use pseudonyms for all of the children andyoung people interviewed except for two: Kiera Wilmot and Veronica Limia.Kiera’s arrest received national media coverage. She and her mother bothagreed that her name could be used in this report. Veronica Limia, who was prosecuteddirectly in adult court at age 17, is now 31 years old and an attorney. Her lawschool graduation, as well as her background as a child in the criminal system,have been covered in local newspapers, and she gave consent to use her name inthis report.The statistics in this report are all based on data providedby Florida’s Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ).In April 2013, Human Rights Watch sent freedom ofinformation requests to state attorneys in all 20 Florida circuits, requestingindividual record data for all juveniles charged directly by prosecutors intheir adult courts from 2007 until April 2013. State attorneys for the followingjudicial circuits provided the requested information: 1st JudicialCircuit, 4th Judicial Circuit, 6th Judicial Circuit, 7thJudicial Circuit, 8th Judicial Circuit, 9th JudicialCircuit, 12th Judicial Circuit, and 18th JudicialCircuit. State attorneys for the following judicial circuits claimed that theyhad no responsive records or were not obligated to provide them byFlorida’s public records law: 3rd Judicial Circuit, 6thJudicial Circuit, 11th Judicial Circuit, and 13thJudicial Circuit. State attorneys for the following judicial circuits had notresponded to Human Rights Watch’s request by the time of this writing: 14thJudicial Circuit, 15th Judicial Circuit, 16th JudicialCircuit, 17th Judicial Circuit, 19th Judicial Circuit,and 20th Judicial Circuit. State attorneys for the followingcircuits had indicated an intention to provide the requested information, buthad not provided it by the time of this writing: 2nd JudicialCircuit, 5th Judicial Circuit, and 10th Judicial Circuit.Because some responsive circuits provided individual record leveldata as per our original request, whereas others provided aggregated data,Human Rights Watch was not able to use that data to compare between circuits.Accordingly, we have relied on the data provided by the DJJ.Finally, Human Rights Watch asked Florida’s Office ofCourt Administration (OCA) for data on youth charged directly in adult court byFlorida’s prosecutors. The OCA made several attempts to provideresponsive data, but their data did not include information on whetherindividuals were transferred from juvenile court or their ages at the time ofoffense, making it impossible to extract the information sought by Human RightsWatch.I. BackgroundJuvenile Courts in the UnitedStatesSince the founding of the world’s first juvenile courtin Illinois in the 1890s, legal systems in the United States have recognizedthat children are different from adults and should be treated differently.[1]While criminal justice has traditionally been understood to achieve fourgoals—retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, andrehabilitation—adult criminal courts in the United States have becomeincreasingly focused on retribution and incapacitation. Juvenile courts, on theother hand, have always prioritized rehabilitation.[2]Almost every juvenile court system in the United States hashad, since its inception, some form of judicial waiver procedure, whereby ajudge could determine when a juvenile should be transferred to adult court.[3]Prior to the 1980s, and consistent with the preference for treating children inthe juvenile court, such waivers were rarely used.[4]Beginning in the 1980s, however, at least in part in response to an increase injuvenile crime, nearly every US state made it easier to transfer children fromjuvenile courts to more punitive adult courts.[5]The national trend to transfer more juveniles to adult courtcame at a time when the United States was experiencing a steep escalation incrime rates, including rates of violent crime by adolescents.[6]Politicians and pundits warned about an oncoming wave of adolescent“super-predators,” a term coined by then-Princeton Professor JohnDiIulio, and deployed in a highly racialized narrative.[7]In a 1995 article, DiIulio warned that “Americans are sitting atop ademographic crime bomb” and predicted that the following decade would“unleash an army of young male predatory street criminals who will makeeven the leaders of the Bloods and Crips—known as O.G.s, for ‘originalgangsters’—look tame by comparison[.]”[8]Youth of color were overrepresented in media portrayals of crime during thisperiod.[9]The spike in juvenile crime actually had already peaked whenDiIulio wrote those words. The apex came in 1994, by which point the violentcrime index[10]arrest rate for juveniles had increased over 68 percent from its 1980 level.[11]By 2010, the violent crime index arrest rate for juveniles had plummeted towell below the 1980 level.[12]In 2012, the juvenile violent crime arrest rate hit a 32-year low.[13]DiIulio himself has acknowledged that his dire predictions were wrong, and nowadvocates for programs and prevention over incarceration.[14]In 2012, he was a signatory to an amicus brief in Miller v. Alabama, theSupreme Court case challenging juvenile life without parole sentences. Thebrief stated,The prediction of a juvenile superpredator epidemic turnedout to be wrong; in fact, there was no superpredator generation. Professor DiIulio,the original proponent of the juvenile superpredator notion and a signatory tothis brief, has repudiated the idea and “expressed regret, acknowledgingthat the prediction was never fulfilled.”[15]While there has been some softening of the transfer lawspassed in the wake of the “super-predator” hype,[16]many of the most punitive laws remain on the books,[17]despite that fact that transfer to adult court has been linked to an increasein recidivism.[18]Research has shown the ineffectiveness of punishing children,including teens, as adults in order to deter future crime. A 2007 study by theCenters for Disease Control found that “evidence indicates that transferto the adult criminal justice system typically increases rather than decreasesrates of violence among transferred youth.”[19]A Department of Justice analysis of all transfer studies conducted as of 2010determined that none had proven that juvenile transfer laws were an effectivedeterrent to crime.[20]Florida-specific studies have come to the same conclusions. One 2002 studycompared 475 youth charged in adult court with 475 youth who remained in thejuvenile system and found that “nearly 50 percent of the transfersre-offended after age 18 but only 35 percent of the juvenile cases did[,]”even though the youth charged as adults were similar in age, gender, race,prior record, and seriousness of offense.[21]Further, the transferred juveniles who re-offended were more likely to commitmore serious felonies than the non-transferred juveniles.[22]Shay Bilchik, who served as an assistant toFloridaAttorney General Janet Reno during the height of the state’s use ofdirect file in the 1990s later acknowledged that “‘[k]idsprosecuted as adults tend to re-offend more quickly, they re-offend for moreserious offenses, and they tend to re-offend more often.” Those results,he said, were “the trifecta of bad crime policy.’”[23]Prosecutorial DirectFile: The National ContextEvery state has at least one mechanism that allows for thetransfer of children to adult court. Most states use judicial waiver, where ajudge presides over a hearing to determine whether it is appropriate to removea child from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and prosecute him or her inadult court.[24]Both the prosecution and the defense have the right to be heard at a waiverhearing, and the presiding judge considers several factors, including thechild’s amenability to rehabilitation, before deciding whether to send achild to adult court for prosecution.[25]In Florida, the statute governing waiver hearings requiresthe juvenile court judge to consider factors including the seriousness of theoffense, the child’s prior record, and the child’s amenability torehabilitation before deciding to transfer that child to adult court.[26]At the hearing, the judge will hear from the defense attorney, the Departmentof Juvenile Justice, the child’s parents or guardians, and the childherself, as well as the state attorney.[27]If the judge decides to transfer the child, that decision must be in writingand can be appealed.[28]Fifteen states and the District of Columbia also giveprosecutors the option, through a process called direct file, to chargejuveniles directly in adult court, removing them from the jurisdiction of thejuvenile court and thus from further involvement by juvenile court judges indecisions to charge juvenile suspects in adult court.[29]Some of these states, including Florida, also have mandatory provisionsrequiring the prosecutor to charge certain cases directly in adult court.[30]Under direct file laws, the prosecutor’s decision isgenerally made without any oversight from either the juvenile court or theadult criminal court. In nearly all states with direct file laws, the statutesdo not provide guidance as to what factors prosecutors should consider inmaking the decision to charge a child directly in adult court. Even in the fewstates that provide guidance to prosecutors, there is no way to ensure that theguidance is being followed, as there is often no record of the decision oropportunity to challenge it. Indeed, in the view of the US Department ofJustice, “it is possible that prosecutorial discretion laws in someplaces operate like statutory exclusions, sweeping whole categories intocriminal court with little or no individualized consideration.”[31]Ten jurisdictions, including Florida, give prosecutorsdiscretion to charge a 14-year-old in adult criminal court for some offenses.[32]In Montana, a prosecutor can charge a 12-year-old in criminal court for certainpersonal offenses. In Nebraska, there is no age limit for certain felonies. InFlorida, Nebraska, and Vermont, a prosecutor may choose to prosecute anyjuvenile starting at age 16 for any felony. In Wyoming, that age drops to 13.[33]Florida even permits youth accused of misdemeanors to be charged as adultsunder certain circumstances.[34]This patchwork of direct file laws means that a juvenile’s chances offacing such charges, and of facing them without judicial oversight, depend agreat deal on where the child happened to commit her crime.Florida: At the Forefront of Treating Children as AdultsCurrently, Florida ostensibly has three mechanisms fortransferring children from juvenile to adult court. Two of them, judicialwaiver[35] and indictment,which requires a prosecutor to present a case to a grand jury before movingforward with it in criminal court,[36]account for less than 2 percent of cases of children prosecuted in adult court.The third, prosecutorial direct file, which gives prosecutors discretion tofile charges in adult court, accounts for approximately 98 percent of cases andis the subject of this report.[37]Florida has one of the harshest prosecutorial direct filelaws in the United States[38]and has transferred more children out of the juvenile and into the adult systemthan any other state.[39]From 2003 to 2008, Florida transferred youth to adult court at 1.7 times therate of Oregon, the state with the second-highest transfer rate, and 2 timesthe rate of Arizona, the state with the third-highest transfer rate.[40]During that period, Florida’s transfer rate was 8 times the rate ofCalifornia and 5 times the average transfer rate in 12 other states.[41]Florida’s direct file statute is also one of the oldest in the UnitedStates—the Florida legislature passed the state’s first direct filelaw in 1978.[42]Florida’s Direct FileStatuteFlorida’s direct file statute is complex—it hasboth discretionary and mandatory provisions, and whether a particular case iseligible for direct file depends on the child’s age, charges, and priorhistory. At its core, however, it allows for a breathtakingly broad array ofcases to be brought in adult court at the sole discretion of the prosecutor andwithout judicial review. The following three cases illustrate this range.On the morning of April 22, 2013, 16-year-old honor studentKiera Wilmot decided to see what would happen if she mixed a household cleanerand some aluminum foil in a plastic bottle.[43]She conducted her experiment on the grounds of Bartow High School beforeclasses had started.[44]The result? The bottle top popped off, there was some smoke, and Kiera wasarrested and charged with “making, possessing, throwing, projecting,placing, or discharging any destructive device,” a felony charge that canbe brought in adult court as long as the defendant is 14 or older.[45]Fortunately, Kiera was not immediately charged in adult court (because she was16, the prosecutor could have done so under Florida’s direct file law)and, after months of public outrage over what many saw as an unjustprosecution,[46]Kiera was permitted to accept a plea to a diversion program in juvenile court.[47]She is relieved to not have an adult felony conviction, but the time betweenher arrest and the plea was challenging. Her lawyer told her that she was couldface up to 10 years in prison if convicted. She had never been in troublebefore, and the possibility of incarceration frightened her.[48]On March 6, 2012, Oliver B. was arrested at his high school,together with two other boys, for breaking into an empty office at the school aweek earlier and stealing two laptops, a blackberry, a Palm Pilot, and $8 incash. Oliver was offered a sentence of 18 months in a residential facility ifhe pled guilty to juvenile charges. If he turned down the plea, his lawyerwarned him, his case would likely be charged directly in adult court, where hecould face up to 15 years in prison. Oliver had been in trouble before, forpossession of some stolen calculators. In that case, he had pled guilty andbeen sentenced to juvenile probation. Oliver’s public defender in thehigh school theft case “pleaded with [him]” to accept the offer andavoid a conviction in adult court, but Oliver maintained his innocence andrefused the offer of juvenile sanctions. The prosecutor charged Oliver directlyin adult court. Oliver pled guilty and was sentenced to probation.[49]On December 31, 2009, 16-year-old Kenneth Ray Stephens andtwo friends stole a gun from a parked car.[50]The following week, Kenneth and a friend were together in a house when twoother teenagers in a different room of the house heard a gunshot, then heardKenneth yell the victim’s name and start to cry.[51]The victim, while badly injured by a gunshot wound to the head, survived.[52]Prosecutors disagreed with Kenneth’s claim that the shooting wasaccidental, charging him in adult court with attempted murder. It wasKenneth’s first arrest. At the time of his arrest, he was an honor rollstudent and member of the football team. No judge had the power to review thedecision to charge Kenneth in adult court. Facing a 30-year maximum sentence onthe attempted murder charge, Kenneth eventually pled to aggravated assault inexchange for a 15-year sentence. The Florida Department of Corrections haslisted his release date as January 2, 2025.Under Florida’s direct file statute, prosecutors haddiscretion to charge Kiera, Matthew, and Kenneth directly in adult courtwithout any judicial review of the appropriateness of adult court.Initially introduced in 1978, Florida’s legislatorsexpanded the reach of the direct file statute several times during the 1990s.[53]Florida’s current direct file law has both discretionary and mandatoryprovisions. The discretionary provision allows prosecutors to file chargesdirectly against any child aged 16 or older in adult court “when in thestate attorney’s judgment and discretion the public interest requiresthat adult sanctions be considered or imposed.”[54]Children 16 or older charged with a misdemeanor may also be tried in adultcourt if they have had 2 prior delinquency adjudications or adjudicationswithheld,[55]at least one of which was for an act that would be considered a felony in adultcriminal court. It also allows prosecutors to directly charge 14- and15-year-olds in adult court for any of 19 enumerated felonies—Californiais the only state with a longer list of felonies that make a 14-year-oldeligible for adult court.[56]In none of these “discretionary” provisions does the statuteprovide guidance or set forth limitations on the prosecutor’s power.The mandatory provision outlines four circumstances in whicha prosecutor “shall” direct file a child: (1) any 16- or17-year-old who is charged with a violent crime against a person[57]and who was previously adjudicated, or found guilty,[58]of “ the commission of, attempt to commit, or conspiracy to commitmurder, sexual battery, armed or strong-armed robbery, carjacking,home-invasion robbery, aggravated battery, or aggravated assault[;]”(2)any 16- or 17-year-old charged with a forcible felony[59]who has three prior felony adjudications in juvenile court;[60](3) any child of any age who is accused of any crime involving theft of a motorvehicle “and while the child was in possession of the stolen motorvehicle the child caused serious bodily injury to or the death of a person whowas not involved in the underlying offense[;]” and (4) any 16- or17-year-old who is charged with committing certain crimes while in possessionof a weapon or other destructive device.[61]Notwithstanding these mandatory provisions, the statute alsoprovides that the prosecutor may at any time keep any case in juvenile court ifshe “has good cause to believe that exceptional circumstances exist thatpreclude the just prosecution of the child in adult court.” The statuteprovides no guidance as to what those exceptional circumstances might be.[62]Prosecutors must also charge a child in adult court when shewas previously charged and sentenced as an adult. Under the “once anadult, always an adult” provision of Florida’s direct file statute,once a child is sentenced as an adult, that child will automatically be triedin adult court for any subsequent offense, no matter how minor.[63]For example, a 15-year-old who steals a car for a joy ride could be chargedwith grand theft in adult court, since grand theft is one of the 19 enumeratedfelonies for which 14- and 15-year-olds can be tried as adults. Stealing a caris a third degree felony,[64]punishable by up to five years in prison.[65]If, a year later, that same child steals a bag of chips from a grocery store,any larceny charges brought against her would have to be filed in adult court.[66]Direct file has almost entirely displaced judicial waiver inFlorida, as the data below shows.[67]Human Rights Watch’s interviews for this report bear out the statistics:when asked if he ever requested judicial waiver hearings, one prosecutorresponded “why would I?”[68]Which Children Are BeingProsecuted in Florida’s Adult Courts?Types of OffensesAccording to new analysis of Florida data conducted by HumanRights Watch for this report, more than 12,000 juveniles were arrested forcrime and transferred from Florida’s juvenile justice system to the adultsystem in the five-year period from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2013, anaverage of 2,420 juveniles annually. The vast majority of thosecases—97.8 percent—reached adult court via direct file. In 2012-13,that figure was 98.3 percent. Thus, while the discussion of data that followsin this section embraces all transfer cases, it is important to recall that thevast majority of those cases are children charged as adults pursuant toFlorida’s direct file statute.[69]Each year, an average of 3.6 percent of juveniles who arearrested in Florida will have their cases transferred to the adult system.While the overall number of transfers has decreased by 53.2 percent over thepast five years, this is mainly due to a 40 percent decrease in the overallnumber of youth entering the juvenile justice system (“juvenile arrestsreceived”) during the same time period. The percentage of juvenilesarrested who are prosecuted in the adult system (“juvenilestransferred”) has remained steady even as violent crime rates havefallen.Click to expand ImageOver the last five years, property felonies and violentfelonies each accounted for 39 percent of charges for which youth were sent toadult court. Drug felonies made up 8 percent of transferred offenses, followedby misdemeanors at 4 percent, and “other felonies” at 1.2 percent.[70]Of youth transferred to the adult system between 2008-09 and 2012-13, most werearrested for burglary (27.6 percent) and armed robbery (15.7 percent).Table 1: Offenses of Transferred Youth (2008-09 -2012-13)Offense% of Total Transfers Accounted by OffenseBurglary27.6%Armed Robbery15.7%Aggravated Assault or Battery13.4%Drug Felony8.0%Weapon Felony6.7%Other Robbery5.2%Misdemeanor Offense4.0%Sexual Battery3.1%Murder2.7%Grand Larceny2.3%Auto Theft2.2%Kidnapping1.9%Other Felonies1.2%Attempted Murder1.2%Non Violent Resisting Arrest0.9%Resist Arrest with Violence0.8%Other Offense (Non-Felony and Non-Misdemeanor)0.7%Felony Sex Offense0.7%Stolen Property0.5%Arson0.5%Fraud0.4%Felony Vandalism0.3%Escape0.1%The vast majority—93.1 percent—of childrencharged in adult court are boys. Less than 1 percent of the girls who enter thejuvenile justice system are sent to adult court compared with nearly 5 percentof boys. In sheer numbers, there are over 13 times more male youth transferredthan females. There are only 2.2 times as many arrests of boys than of girls.We were not able to assess the extent to which the differences in transferrates for girls were due to the nature of the offenses for which they werearrested or other factors.Figure 2, below, shows that children are prosecuted in adultcourt approximately as often for property crimes as they are for violentfelonies. In other words, transfer to adult court is not limited to the mostheinous crimes. This finding is consistent with a study conducted in Florida inthe late 1990s that concluded that the children directly charged in adult courtwere not consistently the most serious offenders.[71]Click to expand ImageOur analysis further reveals that direct file is also notbeing reserved for those who are at the highest risk for reoffending accordingto the Department of Juvenile Justice’s risk assessment tool.[72]Many of those charged directly in adult court by Florida’s prosecutorsare not categorized as being at “high” risk to re-offend. In fact,over the five years for which Human Rights Watch was able to obtain data,nearly two of every five youths directly charged in adult court werecategorized as being at “low” or “moderate” risk tore-offend. In contrast, less than one-third were categorized as being at“high” risk to re-offend.According to our analysis, where children directly chargedin adult court fall along the risk-to-reoffend continuum varies widely amongFlorida’s 20 judicial circuits, with prosecutors in some circuitscharging far more low-risk children than others. In 5 of the 20 circuits (the 1st,3rd, 4th, 15th, and 18th), more ofthe children charged directly as adults were categorized as being at“low” risk to re-offend than as being at “moderate,” “moderate-high,”or “high” risk to reoffend. In 10 of the 20 circuits, by contrast,more were in the “high” risk to re-offend category than in theother categories.Click to expand ImageRacial DisparitiesOur analysis reveals that black boys make up 27.2 percent ofchildren received by the juvenile justice system (arrested and initially sentfor processing to the Department of Juvenile Justice), but account for 51.4percent of transfers to the adult system. White boys make up 28 percent ofchildren received by the juvenile justice system, but account for only 24.4percent of transfers.Table 2: Genderand Race of Arrested and Transferred Youth (FY 2008/09 - 2012/13)Gender/RacePercent of Arrested Youth that AreTransferred (within race/gender group)Percent of Total Arrested YouthPercent of Total Transferred YouthBlack Males6.8%27.2%51.4%White Males3.2%28.0%24.4%Hispanic Males4.2%11.3%13.3%Other Males5.8%2.6%4.1%Black Females0.9%12.2%3.0%White Females0.7%13.5%2.8%HispanicFemales0.7%4.2%0.9%Other Females0.8%0.9%0.2%A simple explanation for this racial disparity might be thatthe crimes of black boys are more serious than the crimes of white boys. Tothat end, we analyzed for this report whether black and white youth arrestedfor similar crimes are transferred to adult court at similar rates. For somecrimes, such as murder and property crimes, the transfer rates do seem to besimilar (see Appendix B). For others, however, there is a marked disparity.Black boys, for example, are significantly more likely than white boys to betransferred to adult court after being arrested for violent offenses other thanmurder: from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2013, 13.3 percent of black boyswere transferred to adult court whereas only 7.4 percent of white boys weretransferred following such arrests.[73]In the graph below, if black and white arrests weretransferred at similar rates, the circuits should be clustered close to (bothslightly above and slightly below) the line. Yet, every circuit lies below theline, indicating that each and every circuit in the state transfers black youtharrested for violent felonies at higher rates than white youth arrested forviolent felonies.Click to expand ImageThe graph shows that the 17th Circuit liesclosest to the line, indicating that although it transfers black youth arrestedfor violent felonies to adult courts at higher rates than white youth, therates are very close to each other. The 16th Circuit lies furthestfrom the line, indicating the largest racial disparity for violent felonyarrest transfer rates.[74]We found similar racial disparities in drug felony arrests.In the graph below, every circuit lies below the line, indicating that eachcircuit transfers to adult court black youth that have been arrested for drugfelonies at higher rates than white youth arrested for drug felonies. We findthe highest disparity in the circuit that transfers the second highest numberof drug felony arrests in the state: the 13th Circuit transferred8.8 percent of white youth arrested for drug felonies and 30.1 percent of blackyouth arrested for drug felonies.Click to expand ImageFor both the violent felony and drug felony racial disparityanalyses, the available data do not allow us to more closely examine the natureof the offenses (e.g., drug quantities) or criminal histories of the offenders,which may offer some explanation for these disparities.[75]Despite the absence of those details, the consistency and size of these racialdisparities are concerning.[76]II. Do Children Belong in the AdultCriminal Justice System?Children are DifferentIt is axiomatic that children are in the process of growingup, both physically and mentally. Their developing identities make young people,including those convicted of crimes, excellent candidates for rehabilitation:they are far more able than adults to learn new skills, embrace new values, andre-embark on a new, law-abiding life. Justice is best served when theserehabilitative principles, at the core of human rights standards, are alsocentral to the process afforded children accused of breaking the law. Thejustice system must take into account both the gravity of the charged crime aswell as the culpability or blameworthiness of the offender. The question ofculpability is part of what separates children from adults. While children cancommit acts as violent and deadly as those adults commit, their blameworthinessis different by virtue of their immaturity. Their punishment, and theadjudicative process to which they are subjected, should acknowledge thatsubstantial difference. International law recognizes these differences andexpresses a strong preference for using juvenile courts to deal with cases of childrenaccused of breaking the law.[77]Children may know right from wrong: proponents of transferprovisions for children correctly point out that most children can tell us thatit is wrong to steal. But by virtue of their immaturity, children have lessdeveloped capacities than adults to control their impulses, to use reason toguide their behavior, and to think about the consequences of their conduct.They are, in short, still “growing up.” Removing children from thejuvenile system and placing them into the adult criminal system negates thatreality, treating children as though their characters are already irrevocablyset.The DifferenceAccording to Psychology and NeurosciencePsychological research confirms what every adult knows:children, including teenagers, act more irrationally and immaturely thanadults. Psychologists have long attributed the differences between adults andchildren to either cognitive or psychosocial differences. Cognitive theoriessuggest that children simply think differently than adults, while psychosocialexplanations propose that children lack social and emotional capabilities thatare better developed in adults.[78]A large body of research has established that adolescentthinking is present-oriented and tends to either ignore or discount futureoutcomes and implications.[79]At least one researcher has found that teenagers typically have a very shorttime-horizon, looking only a few days into the future when making decisions.[80]Another study concluded that only 25 percent of 10th graders (whoseaverage age is 16), compared to 42 percent of 12th graders (whoseaverage age is 18), considered the long-term consequences of importantdecisions.[81]To the extent that adolescents do consider the implications of their acts, theyemphasize short-term consequences, perceiving and weighing longer-termconsequences to a lesser degree.[82]Psychological research also consistently demonstrates thatchildren have a greater tendency than adults to make decisions based onemotions, such as anger or fear, rather than logic and reason.[83]Studies further confirm that stressful situations only heighten the risk thatemotion, rather than rational thought, will guide the choices children make.[84]In the most emotionally taxing circumstances, children are less able to usewhatever high-level reasoning skills they may possess, meaning that even matureyoung people will often revert to more child-like and impulsive decision-makingprocesses under extreme pressure.[85]All of these differences mean that children, including teenagers, are not asdeterred by the threat of criminal punishment as adults are.[86]Neuroscientists using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to studythe brain are now providing a physiological explanation for the features ofchildhood that developmental psychologists—as well as parents andteachers—have identified for years. These MRI studies reveal thatchildren have physiologically less-developed means of controlling themselves.[87]A key difference between adolescent and adult brainsconcerns the frontal lobe. Researchers have linked the frontal lobe (especiallya part of the frontal lobe called the prefrontal cortex) to “regulatingaggression, long-range planning, mental flexibility, abstract thinking, thecapacity to hold in mind related pieces of information, and perhaps moraljudgment.”[88]The frontal lobe has also been linked to the ability to evaluate potentialrisks and rewards.[89] In children, the frontallobe has not developed sufficiently to perform these functions. Throughoutpuberty, the frontal lobe undergoes substantial transformations that increasethe individual's ability to undertake decision-making that projects into thefuture and to weigh rationally the consequences of a particular course of action.[90]MRI studies have also confirmed that adolescents are more likely to engage inrisky behavior when in the presence of peers.[91]These cell and neural developments in the brain provide an anatomicalbasis for concluding that youth up to age 18 are, on average, less responsiblefor criminal acts than adults. As Daniel Weinberger, director of the ClinicalBrain Disorders Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health, explains, thedeveloped frontal lobe, including its prefrontal cortex, “allows us toact on the basis of reason. It can preclude an overwhelming tendency foraction…. It also allows us to consciously control our tendency to haveimpulsive behavior.”[92]In addition, because their frontal lobe functions poorly,adolescents tend to use a part of the brain called the amygdala during theirdecision-making.[93] The amygdala is a locusfor impulsive and aggressive behavior, and its dominance over the undevelopedfrontal lobe makes adolescents “more prone to react with gutinstinct.”[94]In adult brains, the frontal lobe offers a check on the emotions and impulsesoriginating from the amygdala.[95]The DifferenceAccording to Florida YouthMany of the youth directly charged in adult court interviewedfor this report were, in retrospect, acutely aware of the ways in which theiryoung age and lack of maturity affected their decision-making capabilities atthe time of their crimes.Luke R., serving a 3-year prison sentence for robbery,reflected upon the choices he’d made. “I was impulsive. Iwouldn’t think about the consequences.”[96]Another young man, now 22 and still on probation for a crime he committed whenhe was 17, reflected that, “I don’t do the same things I was doing.I think about things before I do them.”[97]Ava L., who was arrested at 17 for drunk driving, said that “Itdidn’t hit me until I turned 19 that I need to get my life together and Ifeel like I got [it] together but it’s still on my record.”[98]Janine C., a 17-year-old who served a one-year jail sentence after pleadingguilty to a burglary she had committed when she was 16, pointed out that, forjuveniles, “the light bulb could still go off.”[99]The idea that teenagers are in the process of maturing andable to be rehabilitated was also mentioned repeatedly.“I’d never doneanything like that before. I don’t think they understood thateveryone makes mistakes. Everyone does something bad once.”[100]“I don’t think kidsshould be in adult prison, what they need is a deeper route through thejuvenile system so that kids can really change.”[101]“You know everybody makesmistakes, you learn as you go on.”[102]Parents and family members agreed. Stephanie G., ThomasG.’s mother, said about direct file, “They are young. They needsome guidance. Kids do stuff all the time and a lot of time they don’tknow what they’re doing or why.”[103]One judge who has presided over juvenile court for 14 years observed, “I’vebeen here long enough to understand that when someone is 16 and I ask them whythey did it and they say ‘I don’t know,’ I believethem.”[104]Case Study:Matthew N.When Matthew N. was 17years old, he and two friends were arrested for burglarizing a house.According to the police report, the couple who lived in the house called 911when they heard what sounded like someone trying to get in through the backdoor. When police arrived at the scene, Matthew and the two otherperpetrators were walking towards the car they had parked in the driveway.They had cut through the rear porch’s screen door, removed a printerfrom the porch, and left the printer by the side of the house. Matthew hadbeen arrested before for burglary, trespass, and vandalism and was onjuvenile probation at the time of the break-in. He and his co-defendants(both adults) in the printer case all eventually pled guilty. Matthewreceived an adult felony conviction and was sentenced to two years of housearrest followed by one year of probation.Matthew was surprised tohave been charged directly in adult court. “I thought they based it onthe seriousness of the charges,” he said. The experience of adult courtwas stressful for Matthew. “In adult court you could tell there were alot of people coming through so the judge didn’t really care about yourcase other than what the charges are, and the prosecutors were just trying toget you as much time as they can,” he said. To him, it seemed like thejudge played less of a role in adult court than in juvenile court. “Inadult court the prosecutor does more.” He also recalled that “inadult court there was a lot I didn’t really understand.” Indeed,at the time of his interview he was still under the impression that“the juvenile judge makes the decision” to send a case to adultcourt.Being in Orange CountyJail, where he was incarcerated for five months before pleading guilty, waseven more stressful for Matthew. The corrections officers, he said,were crazy. They be doingsome crazy stuff. I remember one time somebody had stolen some bread off thelunch cart and they had everyone locked down for three days. One time I hadgotten kicked out of the classroom for something stupid—I was in thehallway trying to talk to someone in another class.In jail, he said, “Imissed my bed, missed my home. I missed just being able to walkoutside.”At the time of hisinterview with Human Rights Watch, Matthew was serving the house arrest partof his sentence. He was attending college and lamented the decisions he hadmade that had led to his arrest. “I feel like I got my head more on theright track. I’ve got a plan. If I could go back to that night, I’dgive myself the plan I have now.” He did not agree with the decision tocharge him directly in adult court, or with Florida’s direct filepolicies in general. “Kids in adult court, that could ruin the rest oftheir life.”[105]III. Rights Put at Risk by DirectFileCharging Decisions:Opaque and Unlimited DiscretionThe direct file law does not adequately take into account thebest interests of the child, is difficult for children to understand, andproduces arbitrary results.So perfunctory is the process that many young people HumanRights Watch spoke to had no idea what was happening until they were taken fromjuvenile detention to adult jail. “When they came to get me I thought Iwas going home,” one youth recalled, “instead they took me tocounty jail!”[106]Langston T. realized that he was being tried in adult courtonly when he appeared at his bond hearing in criminal court. “Before thatI didn’t even know you could go to county [jail]. I thought you had to be18,” he said.[107]When asked to explain what direct file was and how the process worked, Langstonsaid “I think direct filed is charged as an adult. I don’t know whodecides.”[108]Kingston S. was also unaware of what direct file was priorto being transferred. “This whole time I thought, ‘I’m ajuvenile, I go to juvenile court.’ I didn’t want to go to thecounty jail. I first heard the words direct file at my bond hearing over the TV[many bond hearings are conducted over television feeds between the courthouseand the jail].”[109]Each of Florida’s 20 state attorneys’ offices isfree to determine its own criteria and practices for making direct filedeterminations. As a result, practices vary widely. For example:The 4th Circuit (which includesClay, Duval, and Nassau counties) has written guidelines which track the directfile statute closely.[110]The discretionary direct file section of the guidelines includes all of theenumerated felonies found in the statute except for murder, which the 4thCircuit guidelines consider to be a mandatory direct file charge.In the 8th Circuit (whichincludes Levy, Baker, Union, Bradford, Alachua, and Gilchrist counties), thejuvenile division chief state attorney consults with the chief assistant stateattorney, who has the final say in direct file decisions. The elected stateattorney may also be consulted. In deciding whether to direct file, the 8thCircuit state attorney considers the age of the child, the nature of the crime,and the child’s record. “We’re a small legal community. Welisten to the defense attorneys. It’s not policy to hear from them,there’s not a formal process.”[111]In the 11th Circuit (which consistsentirely of Miami-Dade County), the juvenile division chief state attorneyreviews every juvenile case and makes a determination of whether to file anotice of intent to direct file, based on the child’s age and priorrecord, as well as the nature of the charges.[112]Once the notice of intent has been filed, if the defense indicates an interestin entering a plea in juvenile court, the case is set for a “multistaffing,”or meeting that includes the prosecutor, defendant, defense counsel, and representativesfrom the Department of Juvenile Justice. If all parties agree on a disposition,the case remains with the juvenile court.[113]In the 17th Circuit (whichconsists entirely of Broward County), two assistant state attorneys, theassistant state attorney in charge of the juvenile division, and a juniorcolleague review every case considered for direct file and make the finaldetermination, with input from the elected state attorney in high profilecases.[114]Maria Schneider, the attorney-in-charge of the juvenile division, says that heroffice files a “notice of intent to review for direct file” incases where the charge is a violent crime against a person or the defendant hasan “extremely long record” or is about to turn 18.[115]In Tampa, Florida, there is no single personor team tasked with making direct file determinations.[116]The intake state attorney who gets the case makes a determination inconsultation with her division chief or with the juvenile bureau chief in thestate attorney’s office (there are “eight or nine regular intakedivisions”).[117]Judges and defense attorneys throughout the state describedirect file decisions as haphazard. The use of direct file is “basically arbitrary,as I see it,” said Judge Henry Davis, who presides over juvenile court inJacksonville, Florida, which is part of the 4th Circuit.[118]Judge Davis stated that he did not “know whether there’s anyconsistency. I don’t see a pattern.”[119]Buddy Schulz, a Jacksonville private attorney who has done pro bono work onchildren’s issues for decades, told us that he has started receiving manymore calls from judges asking him to take on juvenile cases directly charged inthe adult courts in the last five years, and has handled over a dozen such casesin that time period.[120]Mr. Schulz told Human Rights Watch he saw “no rhyme or reason” todeterminations of which cases should be directly charged in adult court. Onepublic defender who practices in the 10th Circuit noted prosecutorsdo not have “real guidelines.” She said that “if they justdon’t like a kid they can direct file. If they don’t want to go totrial they can direct file. It shouldn’t be for just any reason.”[121]In Jacksonville, defense attorneys stated that prosecutorschoose to directly charge children in adult court “more on a whim andmore for leverage.”[122]They said that prosecutors in Jacksonville were loath to litigate in juvenilecourt. “If there’s any kind of suppression issue [like adefendant’s claim that evidence against him was wrongfully obtained],they’ll send it up [to adult court],” said one Jacksonville defenseattorney.[123]The Jacksonville defense attorney said that, in one instance, prosecutors hadindicated that they had reviewed a case for direct file and decided to keep itin juvenile court. The case proceeded in juvenile court, but, after thedefendant turned down several pleas and requested a trial, the prosecutorannounced that they were once again reviewing whether the case should be directlycharged in adult court.[124]Other lawyers described the system as valuing consistencyover individualization by subjecting all crimes within certaincategories to direct charge in adult court. “Here, their attitude is ifyou’re 16 or 17, and you burglarized a house, they’re going todirect file you. If you steal a car, they’re going to direct fileyou,” said one Tampa (13th Circuit) public defender,“anything with a gun they’ll direct file.”[125]Representatives of the 13th Circuit state attorney’s officedenied that they automatically direct filed all gun cases, but said thepresence of a gun was a factor they considered.Teenagers themselves were much less clear about what chargescould land a person in adult court. One teenager who was awaiting trial inOrange County Jail had heard about direct file because he had “seen otherpeople from [the juvenile detention center] get direct filed.”[126]In his mind, “[i]f you had a serious charge you could go to the adultplace.” He had no idea that he was eligible to be charged directly inadult court until he was picked up from the juvenile detention center and takento the adult jail. “I felt bad,” he recalled. “I didn’tknow where I was going. It was a third degree felony and I thought you onlywent in [to adult jail] for murder and stuff.”[127]Young people who spoke to Human Rights Watch overwhelminglyfelt that direct file decisions were arbitrary. Many people interviewed forthis report did not even know that the prosecutor made the decision to sendthem to adult court. One child thought he had been charged directly in adultcourt because “the [juvenile] judge got tired of seeing me.”[128]Another young person, who was 14 years old at the time of arrest, said in aletter to Human Rights Watch that “I was prosecutorial direct file by myjuvenile judge which was my adult judge best friend.”[129]Those who did know that the prosecutor was responsible for the decisioncriticized the process as biased. “I feel like the prosecutor’sone-sided,” said one teenager who was on probation for a robbery attempt.“I feel like if anybody should do that it’s the judge. The judge issupposed to try to mediate. The prosecutor’s all for the state.”[130]Kyle F., who is serving three-and–a-half years after pleading guilty to arobbery charge, said, “you can’t put that much control in oneperson’s hands.”[131]The lack of a review mechanism for direct file decisionscompounds the problems caused by giving prosecutors such broad discretion.[132]Most prosecutors interviewed for this report felt that their responsibility tothe “community” that elected them was an appropriate check on broadprosecutorial discretion to charge children directly in adult court. When askedabout the potential for a prosecutor to abuse her discretion, Maria Schneider,head of the juvenile division of the 17th Circuit state attorney’soffice, said “that’s always a threat in criminal justice.That’s why the community has to get involved.”[133]William Cervone, the elected state attorney for the 8th Circuit ofFlorida, stated that prosecutors are in a better position to make direct filedeterminations because they better reflect “the community perspective.Community members can come into my office and meet with me,” he said,“judges don’t really do that.”[134]Todd Bass, the juvenile division chief for the 11th Circuit, whichconsists entirely of Miami-Dade County, stated that, “We are the onlyagency that is both responsible for the wellbeing of the child and the bestinterest of the community.”[135]Whether a state attorney’s office is opting for directfile arbitrarily, as a matter of convenience to avoid juvenile courtlitigation, or automatically transferring all children charged with certaincrimes, children’s protected status or capacity for rehabilitation is nottaken into account. Many young people interviewed for this report seemed tounderstand this, and felt a sense of injustice and hopelessness as a result.Luke R. described feeling hopeless once in adult court, saying,“I’ve seen people, juveniles [get in trouble] three, four times andnever get prison. I never had a felony on my record [and they sent me to adultcourt]. I may as well just quit, that’s how I felt.”[136]John C. felt similarly hopeless when he found out he was being charged in theadult system. “I felt like my life was gone,” he said. [137]Judge Janet Ferris, a retired judge who began her career asa prosecutor, oversaw hundreds of juvenile cases during her 11 years on thebench. She described the current direct file system as one in which “thestate attorney holds all the cards and everyone else is scrambling.”[138]“As long as you’re giving one party all the tools,” she said,“that’s not justice.”[139]Arbitrary Use of DirectFile and Resulting DisparitiesAs the data below shows, there is enormous diversity amongFlorida judicial circuits in transferring children to adult court. WhileFlorida state transfer data does not distinguish between juvenile courttransfers to adult court and cases filed directly by prosecutors in adultcourt, remember that the latter cases account for 98 percent of all transfers,allowing one to draw fairly robust conclusions about direct file cases eventhough the direct file cases are not separated out in the data.For example, 1,436 youth were transferred to adult court inthe 13th Circuit during fiscal years 2008 to 2012, whereas only 27 weretransferred in the 16th Circuit during the same time period.Table 3:Percent of Arrests Transferred by Circuit (FY 2008/09 - 2012/13)CircuitAvg.

The average annual rate at which circuitstransferred arrested youth to adult court ranged from 1.5 percent of arrestedyouth transferred in the 20th Circuit to 6.6 percent in the 15thCircuit. We examined the relationship between the percentage of youth arreststhat are transferred and the percentage of youth arrests that are violent ineach circuit to determine whether circuits with more serious crime transferchildren to adult court at higher rates. There appears to be no significantcorrelation between these two factors and no linear relationship between them.[140]As the below graph illustrates, if there were a linearrelationship between criminality and transfer rates, we would expect circuitsto be plotted along an ordered line. In other words, if the decision totransfer a child to adult court has to do with the violence of the crime, wewould expect to see the trend in a plot that shows the percentage oftransferred youth arrests increasing as the percentage of violent youth arrestsincreases. Instead, circuits are plotted in a nonlinear, jumbled order.Click to expand ImageOf even greater concern are the tremendous discrepancies inthe punishment received by transferred youth. For example, the 4th Circuitsentenced 74.3 percent of transferred youth to adult jail or prison time; bycontrast, the 11th Circuit sentenced 11.9 percent of such childrento adult jail or prison time. Human Rights Watch compared these outcomes topossible differences in population size, rate of transfer to adult court, and whetherthe transfers to adult court involved crimes of violence, and in each casefound the punishment rates unrelated to these factors.If the violent nature of a child’s offense or thepopulation size of her town or city cannot explain disparities amongFlorida’s circuits regarding the decision to prosecute children in adultcourt or what sentences children receive upon conviction, it is clear somethingelse must be at play. While we cannot reach a definitive conclusion, the datasuggest that these differences are rooted in the way Florida’s prosecutorschoose to exercise their considerable discretion.Proceedings NotTailored to ChildrenDue process in a criminal prosecution is meaningless if theperson charged does not understand the proceedings. Most young peopleinterviewed for this report described adult court as a baffling place. MatthewN. acknowledged that “in adult court there was a lot I didn’treally understand.”[141]Even the bond hearing, where the only decision being made is whether and howmuch bail to set, was confusing to many. Florida law allows for bond hearingsto be conducted over an audiovisual feed rather than in person, which cancompound the confusion. Luke R., when asked about his bond hearing, said thatall he remembered was “big words.”[142]Kingston S. recalled that his bond hearing “was scary for me because myfather and attorney weren’t there with me. You had to see them through ascreen.”[143]Kingston’s comprehension did not increase as the proceedings went along.“No one explained to me how direct file works. Even after I heard thewords, I didn’t know what it meant,” he said.[144]For some of the young people Human Rights Watch spoke to,the incomprehensibility of adult court proceedings stood in stark contrast tothe more easily understood juvenile proceedings they had experienced before.Samuel H., who was subjected to direct file and convicted of grand theft forhaving stolen jewelry at age 16, compared his experiences in adult court andjuvenile court:Here [in adult court], they use all these types of bigwords and you don’t really comprehend. They’re talking about youbut you don’t know what they’re saying. In juvenile court,they’ll ask you if you understand and they’ll actually break itdown for you. Here you’re just lost until your attorney sees you…[145]The pace of criminal court and the lack of parentalparticipation in proceedings also hampered juveniles’ ability tounderstand what was going on. “They don’t take the time to explainwhat’s going on—they just want to get you in and get you out assoon as possible. If they had taken the time to explain, that would’vebeen better,” said Luke R. who was charged directly in adult court andpled guilty to a burglary committed two months after his 17th birthday.[146]“In juvenile the judge would ask my mom how I’m doing and actuallylisten to her,” recalled Samuel H., who, when he spoke to Human RightsWatch, was in jail for violating a probation sentence he had received for aburglary he committed at age 15.[147]“Here, you’re only in the courtroom for five seconds, and you haveto get up at like 4 in the morning [to get to court from jail].”[148]For Keith L., in juvenile court it “felt comfortable to have my mom nextto me. [In criminal court] it felt different. Like I’m by myself orsomething.”[149]Young defendants also perceived a difference in terms of howthe people in charge treated them in adult versus juvenile court. Matthew N.observed,In juvenile court, I felt like the judge cared a littlemore than adult court. In adult court you could tell there were a lot of peoplecoming through so the judge didn’t really care about your case other thanwhat the charges are, and the prosecutors were just trying to give you as muchtime as they can.[150]Regarding who controlled each process, Matthew stated that“in juvenile court I didn’t really deal with the prosecutor. Thejudge does more. In adult court the prosecutor does more.”[151]In John C.’s experience, the juvenile court judge was much moreunderstanding than judges in criminal court: “He didn’t treat melike I was a menace to society. He actually treated me like I wasn’t apiece of shit who deserved to do a long time. He treated me like a kid who hadmade a mistake.”[152]Mark V. had a similar opinion regarding the differences injuvenile and adult court judges, saying that “[j]uvenile judges were alittle bit more open to what I had to say. They always were looking foralternatives to incarcerating me. This judge [in adult court] looked at me likeI was an animal.”[153]Sander A. observed that “in adult court, they want to lock us up. Injuvenile court they want to help us make better choices.”[154]Manuel R. felt that in adult court “it seemed like their only plan for mewas to take me away for as long as they could and just put me right back in thestreets.”[155]Jacob M. agreed that, in adult court, “it seems like they want you to domore time.”[156]Parents are often as bewildered as their children by theprocess in adult court, which is not tailored to the needs of their childrenand, unlike the juvenile court process, does not treat parents as activeparticipants in their children’s lives. Parents who spoke to Human RightsWatch explained that they were confronted with an adult court system where theydid not necessarily have any input into their child’s case. MichelleStephens’ son, Kenneth, pled guilty to shooting a friend, an act whichKenneth maintains was accidental. When Kenneth’s case was still in thejuvenile division, Michelle remembers an orderly process that differed markedlyfrom the chaos she encountered in adult court:When he was in [juvenile court], when he showed up tocourt, the bailiff would check to see if you [the family members] are here, howmany people you have. He’d check the list. When your child’s casewas called, you could go and stand with your child. As soon as [Kenneth] was[subject to direct file], we had to go to adult court. It was crazy. Nobody waskeeping a list. The first time we went, the court was full and theywouldn’t let us in. Finally [Kenneth’s] lawyer came out and gotus. Seeing all of the adults there was very scary. You sit in there, youcan’t hear. They’re talking about my son and I can’t hearanything. Next thing you know it’s over and I had no idea what justhappened.[157]The mother of Thomas G. similarly remembered adult court as“more stressful”[158] than juvenile court.Victoria C., the grandmother of Jarvis J., thought that adult court was ahumiliating experience. “Walking into adult court, I felt shame,”she recounted. “We had people behind us talking about how hemust’ve done something really bad if he was so young and in adultcourt.”[159] Oliver B.’smother, Christina, remembers her first day in adult court as “scary. Iwas crying the whole time.” She said that “criminal court was mean.The judge was very intimidating. When [Oliver] said he wanted to fight thecase, he looked at [Oliver] like he was crazy. He said ‘did you know youcan get 15 years for this?’”[160] Her son eventually pledguilty, resulting in an adult felony record and a sentence of threeyears’ adult probation.Children Under Pressureto PleaThe pressure to plea affects both adults and children in theUS criminal justice system.[161] However, due to the developmental factors discussed earlier, juveniles areparticularly ill-suited to handle this pressure.[162]One 2003 study examining trial competency among a sample of 1,393 children andyoung adults found that the ability to comprehend trial proceedings was loweramong younger people—children aged 11-13 demonstrated lower levels ofcomprehension than did 14-15 year olds, who in turn demonstrated lowercomprehension than 16-17 year olds. When presented with identical hypotheticalplea scenarios, younger participants were significantly more likely to pleadguilty than were older participants. The study also found that people 17 andyounger are more likely than people aged 18-24 “to make choices thatreflect a propensity to comply with authority figures, such as confessing tothe police rather than remaining silent or accepting a prosecutor’s offerof plea agreement.”[163]Conversely, a juvenile’s reduced capacity toeffectively weigh risks can also result in turning down a favorable plea offer.[164]In a law review article discussing the difficulties of counseling young clientsin plea negotiations, Abbe Smith, a defense attorney and law professor,described the reluctance of one teenaged client (“Benny”) to accepta very favorable plea offer:It was hard to know what exactly was going on with Benny.Consistent with what we know from developmental psychology, Benny seemed tooverestimate rewards (“I ain’t takin’ no plea causewe’re gonna beat this case and then I’m goin’ home.”)and underestimate risks (“Nobody will believe that crackheadcomplainant.”). Although we didn’t know whom exactly he was talkingto about his case, he seemed to be influenced by his peers in the jail(“Everyone here is sayin’ I should fight the case, not take noplea.”). He seemed utterly incapable of considering and weighing thelong-term consequences of rejecting the plea offer because he could not fathombeing in prison for any period of time. (“Two years? I might as well belocked up for seven. Ain’t no difference.”).[165]Regardless of whether a teenager’s immaturitymanifests itself as a proclivity to take unfavorable pleas or to refusefavorable pleas, plea decisions are particularly challenging for children whomight feel extra pressure in the context of a threat by the prosecutor to chargethem directly in adult court.In the direct file context, the pressure to plea arises bothbefore charges are filed in adult court and afterwards. Prior to bringing adultcharges, there is tremendous incentive for juveniles to take pleas, even pleasthat involve confinement, in order to avoid being charged in an adult systemwhere they face much longer sentencing exposure and an adult felony conviction.We have no way of knowing how many children accept unfavorable pleas in thejuvenile court in order to avoid adult court and criminal sanctions. We knowthat fewer than 5 percent of juvenile delinquency cases go to trial.[166]It was not possible to identify and interview juveniles who pled guilty injuvenile court for the sole purpose of avoiding a prosecutor’s threat tocharge them directly in adult court.[167]In the context of a threat to file charges directly in adultcourt, the pressure to plea stems from the differential between juvenile courtand adult court sanctions and the long-term consequences of an adultconviction. A juvenile court judge has a range of sentencing options, the mostsevere of which is sending the child to a “maximum risk” juvenileresidential facility for 36 months. Those sentencing options are geared towardrehabilitation, with programs provided even in maximum risk facilities. InFlorida, juvenile records are sealed automatically once the defendant turns 24or 26, depending on the defendant’s offense history. In contrast, adultcourt judges can, and often must impose very lengthy sentences due tomandatory minimum sentencing laws. Youth convicted in adult court must alsocontend with an adult criminal record for the rest of their lives. While adultcourt judges also have the option to impose juvenile sanctions in many cases,they do not often exercise this option, as discussed below.In some jurisdictions, children are explicitly threatened toeither agree to placement in a maximum or high-risk juvenile facility or facecharges in adult court.[168]Harry Shorstein, who served as the elected state attorney for the 4thCircuit from 1991 until 2008 and who is in private practice in Jacksonville,stated that using a direct file threat to obtain a plea “…isprolific here. The policy is to overcharge everyone with the idea of extractinga plea.”[169]A public defender in Tampa observed that “[prosecutors will] say,we’ll keep it in juvenile if you take a plea.”[170]Even where the threat is not explicit, the possibility ofdirect file is often enough to cause defendants to feel tremendous pressure.One Miami public defender explained, “the moment they announce intent todirect file, the kid coughs up a plea.”[171]According to that same public defender, children often plea specifically toavoid a charge in adult court, and do so before they or their lawyer has evenhad a chance to obtain discovery of evidence from the prosecutor, without whichit is difficult to weigh the advisability of going to trial.[172]Another lawyer commented on the lack of influence defenseattorneys in the juvenile division have when prosecutors have unfettered powerto directly charge a child in adult court. A juvenile defense attorney cannotchallenge the direct file decision, and is left with only two options: accept aguilty plea in juvenile court (assuming one is offered), regardless of whetherthe case presents any issues worthy of trial, or allow the child to be moved toadult court, where she will be assigned an adult-division lawyer. “As anattorney, I feel like I’ve lost when I hear ‘direct file’because there is nothing else I can do for this child,” said one attorneyin the juvenile division of the Jacksonville public defender’s office,“I no longer have a chance to fight for this kid.”[173]Defense attorneys feel particularly powerless because the consequences in theadult system are so serious. “It’s such a major disparity betweenthe juvenile and adult sanctions that you basically have to bend and agree toeverything, no matter how unreasonable,” said one attorney. “Therisk of rolling those dice—I think it’s safer to play Russianroulette with a loaded revolver than it is to willingly go to directfile.”[174]One study by Florida’s Department of Juvenile Justice(DJJ) found that, perversely, children whose risk of reoffending makes them theleast deserving of punitive time in custody are the ones more likely to acceptpleas. The study found that youth at low risk of reoffending were more likelythan high-risk youth to accept pleas involving time in a residential facility,bypassing the opportunity to have the Florida Department of Juvenile Justiceasses the youth and provide a sentencing recommendation.[175]While the DJJ study did not examine the role of direct file threats in thesedecisions to plead guilty, the direct file threat may well influence the pleadecisions made by low-risk youth. A recent article in Florida Times-Unioncame to the conclusion that threats of prosecution under the direct filestatute were influencing plea decisions in Jacksonville-area juvenile courts.[176]According to data obtained by that journalist, the 4th JudicialCircuit (which includes Jacksonville) sentenced more children to residentialfacilities than any other circuit, many of them through plea agreements.[177]An estimated 4 out of 5 children in Jacksonville who agreed to plea deals injuvenile court involving residential placement did so after being threatenedwith prosecution in adult court.[178]Case Study:Oliver B.Christina S. thoughtnothing of letting her 16-year-old son Oliver B. walk to his high school withsome friends one Tuesday night. She had church choir practice, and Oliverwanted to play basketball on the high school’s courts. Oliver returnedfrom playing basketball that night and their life resumed its regularroutines. But one week later she got a call from a school resource officertelling her that Oliver had been arrested—that the previous Tuesday,three boys had broken into an empty office at the high school and stolen twolaptops, a blackberry, a Palm Pilot, and $8 in cash.Oliver’s case went tojuvenile court, where he was offered a sentence of 18 months in a residentialfacility if he pled guilty. If he turned down the plea, his lawyer warnedhim, his case would likely be sent to adult court, where he could face up to15 years in prison. Oliver’s public defender “pleaded with[him]” to accept the offer and avoid a conviction in adult court,Christina said. Oliver maintained his innocence, however, and wanted to fightthe case. His mother supported his decision. “They were not going totake my baby from me for a year and a half,” she recalled thinking.Oliver had been in troublebefore, for possession of some stolen calculators. In that case, he had pledguilty and been sentenced to juvenile probation. While Christina thinks thatthe prior arrest was the reason the prosecutor decided to send Oliver toadult court, she does not know with any certainty—in Florida,prosecutors can transfer a 16-year-old charged with any felony to adult courtwithout stating any reason.Once his case was moved toadult court, Oliver was taken to county jail. His mother went to court forhis bond hearing. “I was crying the whole time. He was in for a day.Not even a day” before Christina was able to get him out on a $12,500 bond.In adult court, the prosecutor offered Oliver three-years’ probation ifhe pled guilty. For six months, Oliver refused the plea, insisting on goingto trial and proving his innocence. The first time he declined the plea,“the judge looked at me crazy and said to me ‘you do know that ifyou are found guilty you will face 11-15 years in prison?’” hesaid. Oliver’s adult court lawyer also encouraged him to take the plea.“Everyone told us ‘if you go to trial, the people judging youwill be the people across the bridge,’” in the whiter, wealthierparts of town, Christina said. Oliver did finally take the plea, four daysbefore his trial was scheduled to begin. “If I would have let a jurydecide my fate I would have gotten 11-15 years in prison, so I chose to be …a felon at 16,” said Oliver. “What happened to me was unfair, Iam afraid to leave my home in fear that anything will land me inprison.”[179]Case Study: Ava L.In July 2010, less than amonth after her seventeenth birthday and while on vacation from her Job Corpsprogram, Ava L. went to a party, drank too much, and took some Xanax. Whiledriving home, she was pulled over by a police officer. Rather than comply,she fled in her car, causing an accident in the process, though fortunatelyno one was injured. She was eventually caught and arrested, and the case wasbrought in juvenile court. While that case was pending, a friend who was ayear or two older than her introduced her to a new drug,“Roxies.” She and the friend tried to rob a woman outside of apawn shop in order to get more money for the drug. The attempt failed, andpolice came to Ava’s house to arrest her. This time, Ava was not takento the Juvenile Assessment Center, where arrestees younger than 18 aregenerally processed. Instead, she was taken directly to the adult countyjail.“There were no otherjuveniles there,” she recalled. “It was so lonely.” Evenvisitation was painful for Ava. “In county [jail] you have to visitthrough a phone, you’re watching through a screen. It hurt ‘causeI couldn’t see my mom for so long.”Prior to the two incidentsthat got her to adult court, Ava had one prior arrest—for a trespasscommitted while she was skipping school. She had dropped out of regular highschool at 16 and started a job training program. “I was getting ittogether,” she recalled. “Then I was on vacation so I was like,‘let’s party,’” she said of the drunk drivingincident. “I never thought I’d have something on my record forthe rest of my life.”Ava looks at the offensesthat got her into adult court and her adult felony record with deep regret. “Itdidn’t hit me until I turned 19 that I need to get my life together andI feel like I got it together but I still have a record.”[180]Children are also making pre-file plea decisions in theabsence of complete information about their cases. Because of the fact that achild can only be held in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice for21 days and prosecutors seem reluctant to have people released, most of theyoung people interviewed for this report were charged directly in adult court closeto that 21st day. In practice, this means that plea decisions aremade quickly before charges are brought in adult court and without thedefendant having a good idea of what the evidence is in the case. Even injurisdictions where the prosecutor’s policy is to hand over evidencepromptly, 21 days does not provide sufficient time. “They have beenfair,” said one Broward county public defender about the stateattorney’s office in her circuit, “[w]ithin the first 21 days weget a file, a police report, their record. They provide us with whatever theyhave but they don’t always have everything.”[181]Once a child is charged in adult court, the incentives toplea are equally powerful. As described above, the preliminary hearings andprocedures in adult court and confinement in adult jail may pressure a youngdefendant to plea. Moreover, the prosecutors who make the charging decisionsexercise control over the final sentence which judges have little power tomitigate because many offenses carry mandatory minimum sentences.In discretionary direct file cases, judges may, with someexceptions, impose juvenile sanctions (meaning the child serves hissentence  under the jurisdiction of the Department of Juvenile Justice) ormay sentence the defendant under Florida’s Youthful Offender Statute,which limits sentencing exposure to six years for defendants younger than 21,but still leaves a child with an adult felony  conviction.[182]However, in order for the judge to avail herself of this discretion, thedefendant must enter an “open plea” or a “plea to thebench.” In other words, the defendant must enter a plea of guilty to themost serious charge (only prosecutors have the discretion to dismiss charges)[183]without any agreed-upon sentence, and throw himself on the mercy of the courtin hopes that the judge will choose to impose juvenile sanctions or give her aYouthful Offender sentence.[184]Defendants faced with lengthy sentences may be reluctant to take their chanceswith an “open plea,” preferring the certainty that an agreed-uponplea provides.[185]Not a single young person interviewed for this report wentto trial.[186]Many of these individuals seemed not to have had much opportunity to fullycomprehend their pleas. Mark V., who was 17 at the time of his arrest and is nowserving a four-year prison sentence (to be followed by two years of probation)for his adult felony conviction, recalled his impatience with the criminalprocess, saying that he opted to take a plea because “I just wanted toget it over with.”[187]Even though he remembered that the judge asked him whether he wanted to try toget juvenile sanctions (which would have allowed him to avoid a felony record),Mark said that he took the adult sentence because he “didn’t wantto have to wait and go through all the court stuff.”[188]Similarly, when Langston T. was given an offer of a 3-year adult prisonsentence in addition to probation, he “was thinking I might as well justtake it and run with it. I just want a chance to get out; get my GED, go tocommunity college.”[189]Jacob M., who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for a series of robberies hecommitted at age 16, said he decided to take a plea because he “was justgoing with the flow.”[190]His sentencing exposure was, he said, “30 years, or life.”Many of the young people who spoke to Human Rights Watchmade the decision to plea in the face of the lengthy adult sentences they wouldface if convicted at trial. “To me, a month feels like a longtime,” said John C. when asked how he felt when he heard the prosecutor’sinitial offer of an 8-year prison sentence.[191]Karl A., who was in Orange County Jail awaiting trial when he spoke to HumanRights Watch, was initially told he was facing a 25-year maximum sentence whenhe was directly charged in adult court.  “That made tears come outmy eyes and I got a little woozy,” he recalled.[192]“That’s a long time to be away from my grandmother.” At thetime he spoke to Human Rights Watch, Karl’s case was still pending beforethe trial court and he could not discuss his charges. He later pled guilty and,according to the Florida Department of Corrections website, he received anadult felony conviction and sentence of 5 years’ adult probation forassault, criminal mischief, and related charges.In a letter, Lawrence F. explained that “[t]here wasno use in taking my case to trial because if I lost I could have been sentencedto 25 to 35 years. Believe me at age 16 that is not worth risking.”[193]Jacob M., who pled guilty to an adult felony conviction and is serving aYouthful Offender sentence of 2 years in prison, 2 years of house arrest, and 2years of probation, had trouble explaining how he felt when he was told abouthis sentencing exposure if he took his case to trial. “Can you imaginebeing 17 and someone tells you you’re going away for 10 years?” heasked. “It’s crazy to me how they’re going to lock up ateenager for the rest of their lives for one mistake.”[194]Matthew N. decided to plead guilty when he learned he faceda 15-year maximum sentence. Despite the fact that he might have had a gooddefense, “I wasn’t trying to take it to trial,” he said.“I think maybe I could win but 15 years is a long time. That’s alot of time. You could do a whole lot in 15 years.”[195]He took a plea to an adult felony conviction in exchange for 2 years of housearrest and one year of probation, and is currently attending college.[196]Adult Sentences andCollateral ConsequencesThe Convention on the Rights of the Child, an internationaltreaty ratified by every country in the world save the United States andSomalia, states that sentencing of children should take into account “thechild's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and thechild's assuming a constructive role in society.”[197]While Florida judges technically have sentencing options that allow them totake into account the specific characteristics of individual youth, due to themechanics of the plea negotiation process and the application of mandatoryminimums or other mandatory sentencing laws in the adult system, youth-specificsentencing options are often not available.Sentencing After DirectFileWhile judges have the option to consider a juvenile sentencefor some juveniles convicted in adult court, the default is to impose an adultsentence without consideration of the child’s needs and capacity forrehabilitation.[198]The sentencing statute that applies to juveniles convicted in adult courtrequires adult sentences for all juveniles prosecuted pursuant to the mandatoryprovision of the direct file statute.[199]In other cases, the law gives judges the option to impose juvenile sentences(served under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice rather thanthe Department of Corrections) but, even in the cases for which juvenilesanctions are available, the statute states that an adult sentence is“presumed appropriate.”[200]By contrast, a judge considering imposing a juvenile sentence on a childconvicted in adult court must take eight different factors into account beforemaking that decision.[201]If a child defendant wants to place the sentencing decision in the hands of thejudge, she must either plead guilty to the top charge the prosecutor brings, orgo to trial.[202]As shown in table 4, below, the percentage of children whoreceive juvenile sentences varies among jurisdictions. The Florida Departmentof Juvenile Justice provided Human Rights Watch with previously unavailabledata on the sentences given to children prosecuted in adult court betweenfiscal years 2010 and 2012. During that time period, the percentage of childrenwho received juvenile sanctions in adult court ranged from zero in the 14thCircuit to 25 percent in the 15th Circuit.[203]Table 4:Percent of Convictions of Adult or Juvenile Sentences by Circuit (FY2010-2012)CircuitsAdult JailAdult PrisonAdult ProbationTotal Number of Adult Sentences% of Convictions for Adult SentencesTotal Number of Juvenile Sentences% of Convictions for Juvenile Sentences15th Circuit16%22%37%37175%12325%17th Circuit4%26%46%28577%8723%6th Circuit23%21%38%41981%9619%16th Circuit8%8%67%1083%217%13th Circuit11%26%49%57486%9414%Out of State14%36%36%1986%314%11th Circuit6%6%74%45086%7114%8th Circuit10%30%49%7489%911%12th Circuit25%30%35%17290%1910%1st Circuit9%34%47%21690%2310%19th Circuit29%38%25%16792%158%3rd Circuit7%10%76%8793%77%2nd Circuit18%39%37%9493%77%10th Circuit23%24%47%35794%236%18th Circuit14%19%62%17795%95%7th Circuit27%20%48%23095%115%5th Circuit18%43%35%19596%84%20th Circuit16%52%30%9298%22%4th Circuit16%58%24%35598%72%9th Circuit24%37%38%45399%51%14th Circuit8%43%49%96100%00%There is also wide variation among circuits with regards tothe percentage of children who receive adult jail or prison sentences (ratherthan adult probation) after being charged in adult court. From fiscal year2010-2012, the 4th Circuit, which includes Jacksonville, Florida, sentenced74.3 percent of children prosecuted pursuant to the direct file statute toincarceration in the adult system, while the 11th Circuit, whichincludes Miami, Florida, sentenced 11.9 percent of such children toincarceration in the adult system.Table 5: DirectFile Ending in Adult Incarceration by District (FY 2010-2012)CircuitPercentage ofDirect Filed Convictions Sentenced to Adult Jail or PrisonAverageAnnual Population of Youth (10-17)4th Circuit74.3%124,49720th Circuit68.1%101,64719th Circuit66.5%57,1059th Circuit61.1%157,3585th Circuit61.1%89,76312th Circuit56.4%61,9582nd Circuit55.5%35,05414th Circuit51.0%28,2637th Circuit47.3%82,26010th Circuit46.6%73,6416th Circuit43.3%122,8641st Circuit43.1%71,1058th Circuit39.8%33,18115th Circuit38.1%124,81113th Circuit36.8%133,60818th Circuit32.8%100,04817th Circuit30.4%184,0193rd Circuit17.0%18,60916th Circuit16.7%5,50411th Circuit11.9%256,831This variation cannot be explained by the types of crimesfor which children are being directly charged in adult court. As the figurebelow illustrates, violent offenses accounted for 46-48 percent of direct filecases in the 4th, 9th, 11th and 20thCircuits, yet these circuits sentenced children who were charged directly inadult court to adult incarceration at vastly different rates. If there were astrong correlation between the percentage of arrests for violent offenses andthe percentage of transferred youth receiving adult incarceration, we wouldexpect circuits to be plotted along a rough diagonal from the bottom leftcorner of the plot toward the upper right corner. Rather, we find circuitsplotted with no order.Click to expand ImageHuman Rights Watch analyzed a variety of variables todetermine if other factors could explain the variation in the percentages ofchildren sentenced to adult incarceration. None of the variables we analyzedcould do so, including the overall population of the circuit (a proxy for possibleurban/rural differences), the racial composition of circuits, how frequentlyyouth are charged in adult court (rate of transfers per 1,000 youth), or racialdisparities in transfer rates. Our research also does not reveal anydifferences in the availability of adult probation services in thesejurisdictions which might explain why prosecutors or judges would preferincarceration. The more punitive responses in certain circuits appear toindicate that prosecutors and judges are simply exercising their discretiondifferently in obtaining pleas and sentencing juveniles to incarceration in adultfacilities.A child who is convicted in adult court will have a felonyconviction on her record unless given a juvenile sentence to be served underthe supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice. Youthful Offenderstatus, which is available to adults between the ages of 18 and 21, as well asto children under 18, can reduce the sentence but still leaves the child with afelony conviction on her record.Sentencing Under the“Youthful Offender” StatuteIf a defendant is youngerthan 21, a judge can impose a sentence under the Youthful Offender statute,which limits the sentence to a maximum of 6 years of probation, communitycontrol (commonly known as house arrest), incarceration in an adult facility,or some combination of those sanctions.[204]A judge who grants Youthful Offender status is notbound by mandatory minimums. The Youthful Offender statute is only availableto defendants who (1) are between the ages of 18 and 21 or (2) have beentransferred from juvenile to adult court.[205]A defendant who has been previously given aYouthful Offender sentence is not permitted to receive such a sentence again.A defendant convicted of a crime punishable by a life sentence or the deathpenalty is also not eligible for Youthful Offender status. Children who aresentenced as Youthful Offenders are sent to designated Youthful Offenderfacilities, which can be either stand-alone prisons that house only YouthfulOffenders or designated Youthful Offender units within a prison that housesother inmates (mostly adults) who are not designated Youthful Offenders.Conviction as a Youthful Offender is still an adult felony conviction, andchildren serving Youthful Offender sentences are under the supervision of theDepartment of Corrections.Judges often do not have the opportunity to weigh thepossibility of a juvenile sentence because plea bargaining effectively cuts thejudge out of the sentencing decision.[206]In general, the only way for a defendant to have any certainty about whatsentence she will receive in Florida is to negotiate a plea with the prosecutorin which both parties (prosecution and defense) agree on the charge to whichthe defendant will plead guilty and what sentence she will receive. If aprosecutor will not agree to juvenile sanctions, the defendant’s onlychance at obtaining them is to plead to the most serious charge and ask thejudge to sentence her, without an agreement from the prosecutor (this is calledan “open plea” or a “plea to the bench”). The risk isthat the judge may opt against a juvenile sentence and instead decide tosentence the child to a regular adult sentence.“Juvenile sanctions require a plea to the judge and aroll of the dice,” explained Joshua Beard, a felony public defender inJacksonville, Florida.[207]He has never had or heard of a case in which a prosecutor, after charging achild in adult court under Florida’s direct file statute, agreed tojuvenile sanctions. Human Rights Watch was also unable to find any examples ofa prosecutor agreeing to juvenile sanctions once a case had been filed in adultcourt. Thus, in his experience, the only way a child could receive thosesanctions after direct file is if the young person pled to the most seriouscharge and took her chances with the judge—a risky proposition, given thelengthy sentences at stake. Jackson A., who was 15 years old at the time of hisarrest, did take that risk. “I pleaded to the bench so I would have agreat chance of going back to play football on probation or something,”he wrote. His roll of the dice did not work out. He received a sentence of twoyears and four months in prison and has an adult felony record. He wrote,“I’m 17 and leave [prison] in 6 months.”[208]A “Lucky” ResultAfter Making an Open PleaIn Florida’s 4thJudicial Circuit, the odds are overwhelming that a child prosecuted in adultcourt will receive an adult sentence—between 2010 and 2012, only 2percent of the children convicted in criminal court in that circuit receiveda juvenile sentence. Brian T. was one of those lucky few. After initiallyfacing the possibility of a 65-year prison sentence, he received a sentenceof juvenile probation. This “luck” came only after months ofinvestigation and hard work by his attorney, during which Brian was confinedin an adult jail.Brian was 17 years old andwalking on the beach with several friends one January afternoon when theyfound a BB gun. Brian picked up the BB gun. Shortly thereafter, he and hisfriends encountered a homeless couple. With encouragement from his friends,Brian brandished the BB gun at the couple, threatening them. The group movedon—Brian never pulled the trigger, and nobody was injured. The couplecalled the police and reported that they had been robbed at gunpoint. Theyalso provided a description of the perpetrators. Later that evening, Brianwas arrested for stealing a motorized grocery cart from a supermarket, acrime which he was later able to prove he did not commit. Police making thearrest for the grocery cart theft noticed that he matched the description forthe earlier crime against the homeless couple, and Brian was charged withthat crime, as well. Brian still had the BB gun with him when he wasarrested.A month-and-a-half afterBrian’s arrest, prosecutors charged Brian under the direct file statutefor both of the cases and did not offer Brian a juvenile court plea. Theadult court judge ordered him held in county jail without bond, and heremained incarcerated throughout the case. Prosecutors initially chargedBrian with attempted armed robbery with a firearm or other deadly weapon, afirst degree felony[209]punishable by up to 30 years in prison. UnderFlorida’s “10-20-life” statute, which imposes mandatoryminimum sentences for certain felonies that involve firearms, Brian was facinga minimum sentence of 10 years.[210]While a BB gun is not considered a firearm underthe statute,[211]prosecutors were initially reluctant to concedethat the gun used was, in fact, a BB gun. The grocery cart incident, whichprosecutors charged as a grand theft, carried a 5-year maximum sentence inadult court. Under Florida law, these sentences would run consecutivelyunless the judge decided otherwise.[212]Brian, who had only been introuble with authorities once before, for violating Jacksonville’s juvenilecurfew statute,[213]was now facing a maximum sentence of 65 years inadult prison—up to 30 years for each victim in the attempted robberycase, and five years for the grocery cart theft. Unless his lawyer couldsomehow convince the prosecutor to amend the charges—something thatonly the prosecutor has the power could do—Brian was facing between 10and 65 years in prison. If Brian had pled guilty at that point, the judgecould have avoided the 10-year mandatory minimum by sentencing him tojuvenile sanctions or sentencing him as a Youthful Offender. However, becausethe judge could still have legally sentenced him to 65 years, his lawyer,Joshua Beard, thought that entering a guilty plea at that point was much toorisky. He needed to get the charges reduced. Brian was prepared to admit thathe menaced the couple with a BB gun, but denied that he had asked for moneyor otherwise attempted to rob them. Prosecutors would not consider juvenilesanctions, would not agree to a Youthful Offender sentence, would not lowerthe charges, and insisted on Brian serving time in adult prison.As part of hisinvestigation of the cases, Mr. Beard obtained a video of the grocery carttheft from the supermarket. That video showed that somebody else, not Brian,had taken the cart. Mr. Beard also deposed the arresting officer, whoadmitted he had never viewed the exculpatory videotape. Confronted with thevideo and deposition testimony proving Brian’s innocence, theprosecutor agreed to eventually drop those charges, but continued to insiston prison time for the attempted robbery. Because police seized a BB gun(rather than the handgun the victims said they had seen) from Brian when theyarrested him, his lawyer was eventually able to convince the prosecutors thatthe weapon used to menace the homeless couple was, in fact, that BB gun andnot a handgun. Prosecutors amended the charge to armed robbery with a deadlyweapon, which carried a maximum sentence of 30 years. However, since the BBgun was not a “firearm,” Brian was no longer subject to a minimumsentence of 10 years under the 10-20-life statute. At that point, Brian andhis lawyer were willing to go to trial because he was no longer facing amandatory minimum sentence.Brian’s lawyersubsequently convinced the prosecutors to amend the charges to two counts ofattempted aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a third degree felonypunishable by up to five years in prison. The prosecution was still insistingon prison time, however, which Brian and his lawyer were reluctant to accept.Having reduced Brian’s sentencing exposure to 10 years, Brian and hislawyer believed his best option was to enter a plea of guilty to theassault charges, and take their chances with the judge and argue for juvenilesanctions. Brian’s lawyer acknowledged that the decision to enter theplea in hopes of obtaining juvenile sanctions was nerve-wracking. It was avery risky decision, and one that many other children tried as adults inFlorida face. Indeed, every defendant faced with a plea decision faces acomplicated calculus in deciding when to plea.In order for Brian’scase to reach the point where the decision to plead guilty was a calculatedrisk that seemed worth taking, he and his lawyer had to engage in months ofinvestigation and negotiations with the prosecutor in order to get thecharges, and thereby Brian’s sentencing exposure, reduced dramatically.During that time, Brian was incarcerated in an adult jail.Brian and his attorney werelucky that they were able to reduce his most serious charge to one free of amandatory minimum sentence. Brian’s lawyer believes they were only ableto get the more serious firearm charge dismissed because they were able toprove Brian’s innocence of the grocery cart theft and because Brianstill had the BB gun in his possession when he was arrested for that case.Because Brian was only facing one charge and not the original two charges,the judge, freed from having to impose a 10-year sentence, seemed willing toconsider juvenile sentencing options. The outcome Brian achieved isrelatively rare. Unlike Brian, many juvenile defendants lack affirmativeevidence, such as the videotape, that they can use to assert their innocenceor disprove an element of the charges. Brian’s case turned out as wellas it could have—the judge in Brian’s case sentenced him tojuvenile probation until his 21st birthday. By the time he enteredthe plea and received his sentence of probation, Brian had served 206 days incounty jail.[214]The Consequences of an AdultSentenceAs noted above, many young people interviewed for thisreport ended up with adult felony convictions with little understanding of theconsequences of those convictions. Jacob M., interviewed at Sumter CorrectionalInstitution, said that “[a]t a certain point, I knew I was in adult courtbut I still didn’t understand what that meant or why I was there.”[215]Similarly, Calvin W., who pled guilty to stealing a car and is hoping to beable to expunge his record, complained that “[t]hey really didn’ttell me anything about what a felony conviction was. The kids around me and theprobation officer from boot camp had to explain to me about expungement andstuff.”[216]This lack of comprehension is particularly troubling given the broad andlong-lasting effects of an adult felony conviction.ProbationBoth juvenile and adult probation place many restrictionsand requirements on probationers, such as regular meetings with probationofficers, random drug tests, curfews, and GPS monitoring. However, the approachand purposes of juvenile probation, overseen by the Department of JuvenileJustice, are very different from those of adult probation, overseen by theDepartment of Corrections. The statute governing juvenile probation statesthat, in determining the conditions of probation, the Department of JuvenileJustice must take the child’s needs into account and that any programsimposed “shall be designed to encourage the child toward acceptable andfunctional social behavior.”[217]The statute governing adult probation contains no such language regardingrehabilitation.[218]Juvenile probation officers, unlike adult probation officers, also havetraining and experience specifically in working with adolescents.A sentence of adult probation, while it may seem reasonableat first blush since it limits or eliminates the time that a teenager wouldspend incarcerated, can set a child up for failure. One defense attorney whopractices in the 9th Circuit said, “I hate adult probation, Ifeel like you might as well send them to prison now,” since theconditions of adult probation are not designed for adolescents and adultprobation officers are not necessarily experienced in supervising juveniles.[219]Courtney Drew, a juvenile public defender, noticed a difference betweenjuvenile and adult probation. “We have a lot of really good juvenileprobation officers who will go out of their way to help the kids comply,”she said.[220]There did not seem to be the same effort in the adult system. Judge RalphStoddard, who presides over juvenile court in Tampa, said that “[adult]probation tends to be a longer path to jail.”[221]Amy Thornhill, a public defender in the 10th Circuit, observed that“very few people make it through [adult] probation here.”[222]The teenagers sentenced to adult probation can find itdaunting both because of the requirements placed upon them and the loomingprison sentences they face if they fail. For Calvin W., the scariest part ofhis probation sentence is that “the judge told me that if I violate Icould get 2 life sentences.”[223]Case Study: Scott E.Scott E.’s case was dismissed in adult court, but heis still suffering the consequences of his arrest. At 17, he was arrested forhaving allegedly planned a robbery with three other boys. He told us he hadseen the robbery—“some kid at school got robbed by a bunch ofdudes at the park,” and said he actually walked the victim back toschool to get help. He does not know why, but the victim later said Scott hadplanned the robbery.Scott was arrested about a month after the incident. Heremembers the arrest vividly—he had left school to buy lunch, and waswalking back when six police cruisers pulled up and several officers cameout, “guns in hand,” sprinting at Scott. He was angry about theway the arrest happened, and, like the teenager he still is, he “wasmad because of my food. I didn’t get to eat it and I was really hungry,actually.”But the consequences of a wrongful arrest were much moreserious than a missed lunch.  Because he was 17 at the time,Scott’s case started out in juvenile court, where he was offered oneyear of juvenile probation in exchange for a guilty plea. He turned down theplea, and the prosecutor charged Scott directly in adult court. Adult court“was crazy,” said Scott. “I knew I was innocent but I hadto prove my innocence to everybody.” Scott did not know exactly why thecase got sent to adult court. “I think the attitude is that we were 17so we were pretty much adults,” he speculated.Once in adult court, the prosecutor offered Scott asentence of three years’ probation if he pled guilty. Scott declinedthat offer as well, but admits to being frightened going forward. “Inadult court it seemed like I could actually get 10 years for something Ididn’t do. I was actually a little scared. I couldn’t believe itwas going as far as it did.”Although the prosecutor eventually dismissed the case,Scott is still in limbo. Last summer, he wanted to get a job with the city ofTampa as a lifeguard, but they would not hire him because of his arrest. Heworries about his future job prospects, as well. “If [future employers]had to choose between me and another guy who’s never been arrested,they’re going to go with the other guy,” he said. The fact thathe has an adult arrest also prevented him from going to school to become afirefighter. “This criminal charge pretty much ruined all the plans Ihad,” he said.He and his family are trying to get his arrest expunged.His mother and father were frustrated with the process. His mother believesthat Scott was charged directly in adult court because “peopledidn’t want to do their due diligence. They just send it up for theadult court to sort out.” His father agreed, saying “I thinkthere should be some kind of safeguard before you throw these kids in adultcourt. It’s not just the fact that he was arrested. He was kicked outof school. There’s all these detectives scooping kids off the street,throwing charges at them and these kids are taking pleas whether or notthey’re guilty because they’re scared.” While his mother isgrateful that Scott’s charges got dismissed, she said that “theyneed to do more thorough investigation before throwing these kids under abus. While [Scott is] not guilty, he’s still got this black cloudhanging over him because he got direct filed.”[224]Collateral ConsequencesOnce a child is sentenced as an adult, she is subject to allof the collateral consequences that result from an adult conviction. Inaddition to its well-known and much-criticized law barring former felons fromvoting, Florida restricts the rights of convicted felons in the areas ofemployment, education, housing, public assistance, driving privileges, adoptiveand foster parenting, and student loans.[225]For the individuals interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report, thebarriers to employment loomed the largest. This consequence should be of graveconcern to everyone, since studies have found that former offenders who areemployed are much less likely to commit another crime.[226]In Florida, at least 71 occupational groups restrict jobopportunities for felons.[227]While Florida does not allow public employers to deny someone worksolely because that person was once convicted of a crime, the state does notregulate what private employers do. In 2008, former Governor Jeb Bushcommissioned a study of employment restrictions in Florida for convictedcriminals. That study found that over 40 percent of jobs in Florida carriedrestrictions on the hiring of convicted criminals.[228]Florida also permits all employers to ask job candidates whether they have beenarrested on criminal charges (charges under adult court jurisdiction),regardless of whether they resulted in convictions.[229]Thomas G. finished serving a three-year prison sentence inMay 2010 and has had trouble getting and keeping a job since his release. Heattributes this difficulty to the fact that he is a convicted felon, and hisfrustration is palpable:That’s why I say to this day that it is wrong todirect file any kid. What I did when I was 16, that’s still following meand will follow me for the rest of my life. I get a job, and they find out Iwas convicted of a felony, and they’ve got to let me go. I have noproblem with if I did wrong, punish me. But don’t keep it held over mefor the rest of my life.[230]Greg J., who served an eight-month jail sentence after beingdirect filed for possession of marijuana with intent to sell and battery of alaw enforcement officer (for an accident with a police vehicle during a carchase), described the attitudes he had encountered from potential employers:“Do you have a record? That’s the first thing they ask you. Youhave a conviction. They don’t care about anything else. I applied to amoving company where on the application it said ‘if you’ve everbeen convicted as a felon, don’t waste your time.’”[231]Greg is currently “between jobs” and reports to a labor pool onmost days.[232]Samuel H., who was interviewed at the Orange County Jail shortly before he wasto enter a guilty plea, said that his main concern about his pending convictionwas that “it can be hard to find a job. I just think about the job.That’s the main thing that hit me.”[233]Karl A., interviewed while awaiting release from the Orange County Jail afteraccepting a plea deal that sentenced him to 2 years of house arrest followed by2 years of probation, was relieved that his plea would not involve any jailtime beyond the 63 days he had already served, but was already worried that“I won’t be able to get a good job” due to the felonyconviction.[234]Even young people who did not receive adult convictionsafter being prosecuted under the direct file statute faced employmentconsequences, since adult arrests and criminal records are not sealed likejuvenile arrest records.Victoria C.’s grandson, Jarvis, also had his casedismissed after he was prosecuted as an adult under the direct file statute.[235]Victoria spoke to Human Rights Watch one morning while Jarvis was out applyingfor jobs. She said that the arrest wasstill hurting him. This arrest is still the first thingthat comes up when you look him up [online]. That’s going to hurt him inthe long run. He has been trying to find a job. Constantly he’s looking.He’s out looking right now. I went with him to fill out an application towork selling fireworks and I saw when the guy entered his information into thecomputer the first thing that came up was this [arrest].[236]Veronica Limia was prosecuted as an adult under the directfile statute after being arrested for breaking into a neighbor’s house atage 17. She received a juvenile sentence, and was thus able to avoid having afelony conviction on her record. She is now 31 years old and graduated fromFlorida International University School of Law in 2013. She also feels that herexperience in adult court continues to have repercussions for her, particularlyin the employment context. Even though she received juvenile sanctions and isthus not technically a convicted felon, she has encountered situations wherepeople have seen the record of her arrest. “I’ve been veryoutspoken so there are some positive articles about what I’ve done, and Ihave to bring those articles with me on a job interview,” she said.“I’m a lawyer, and [even] I can’t figure out who does anddoes not have access to information about that arrest.”[237]Veronica also spoke about the repercussions her felonyarrest had on her ability to obtain housing, something most of the young peoplewho spoke with Human Rights Watch for this report had yet to encounter, sincethey were either incarcerated or living with their parents. “Do you knowhow hard it is to get an apartment with a criminal [arrest] record?” sheasked. She recounts that when she moved to Miami for law school she “wasup front—I had [a] felony arrest. I told them. I thought I had anapartment and as I was driving down, I got the call that I’d been denied.I had to keep the U-Haul for a week and was basically homeless.” Sheended up having to take an apartment in a neighborhood she said was not safe,since she got denied at all of the more desirable condominiums. “At somepoint there should be a way to allow a person to put that behind them if theydid bad at 17,” she stated.[238]Veronica’s experience with trying to rent an apartmentis not surprising—criminal records, including adult arrest records, arepublic, and potential landlords are free to access them. Furthermore, federallaw allows for the denial of public housing for people with certain prior offenses.[239]Local public housing authorities have broad discretion under this federal lawto deny housing to ex-offenders. In Sarasota, Florida, for example, a personcan be deemed ineligible for public housing for four years on the basis of asingle drug misdemeanor.[240]Sealing and Expunging AdultCriminal Records: A Difficult RoadMany of the young peopleHuman Rights Watch interviewed for this report expressed the hope that theywould be able to have their direct file records sealed or expunged. While Floridadoes allow for adult records to be expunged (destroyed by the agency thatkeeps them) or sealed (made unavailable to the public), this is not easy toaccomplish. Unlike juvenile records, which are expunged once the ex-offenderturns 24 or 26 (the actual age depends on whether the person whose record itis was considered a habitual offender),[241]adult records can be expunged in Florida only incases that did not result in convictions, and a person can only get one caseexpunged during their lifetime.[242]Expunction of adult records is notautomatic—a person seeking to have a record expunged must petition thetrial court, which has complete discretion as to whether to grant thepetition.[243]A child who is convicted in adult court for aforcible felony also loses the opportunity to have any prior juvenile recordsexpunged—in those cases, “the minor’s criminal historyrecord prior to the time of the minor’s adjudication as an adult mustbe merged with his or her record as an adjudicated adult.”[244]Eligibility for having arecord sealed is broader than it is for expunction—as long as a personwas not convicted of certain enumerated offenses, she can petition to haveher record sealed. As with expunction, a person is only allowed to have onerecord, related to a single arrest, sealed in her lifetime.[245]Both the sealing andexpunction processes are complicated, and can cost hundreds of dollars.[246]Furthermore, government agencies often sellcriminal records to for-profit companies who, for example, provide backgroundcheck services.[247]Those companies are not subject to the expunctionand sealing laws, which only direct public agencies to destroy or sealrecords.[248]Thus, even those who go through the lengthy andexpensive process of getting their records sealed or expunged can find thatpotential employers and landlords still have access to information abouttheir prior arrests or convictions.Children Confined inAdult Jails and PrisonsTransfer to Adult JailIn Florida, once a prosecutor charges a child in adult court,that child is automatically moved to an adult jail.[249]Neither the juvenile judge who presides over the case pre-transfer nor theadult court judge who presides over the transferred case has any authority tokeep a child in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice, even ifthose judges believe that the child would be better served there than in acounty jail.[250]In 2006, a Dade County juvenile court judge denied aprosecutor’s motion to transfer a child who had been charged in adultcourt to the custody of the Department of Corrections. In denying theprosecutor’s motion, the juvenile judge made the following finding on therecord:The Court [feels] that it [is] not necessary to transportthe Child to the Dade County Jail. The Child has always shown up to Court inhis prior appearances with his parents and his attorney. The Court [feels] thatthere [is] no useful purpose in having the Child taken into custody and thentransported to the Dade County Jail. Therefore, the Court decline[s] to have thechild [sic] transported to the Dade County Jail. The only purpose that could beserved by transporting this Child under this set of circumstances was to bepunitive as there was no other useful purpose to be served by the Child'sincarceration.The appellate court quashed the judge’s denial of theorder to transfer the child to jail, holding the judge had no authority to haltthe transfer; as a result the child was sent to adult jail.[251]Conditions in AdultJails and PrisonsOnce incarcerated in adult jails and prisons, children areat risk of violence, sexual assault, and suicide.[252]They are separated from their families, lose access to educational and otherservices, and are exposed to adult criminals. One Department of Justice reportexplains the disruptive effect incarceration in adult facilities has onadolescent development:Particularly vulnerable adolescents are … taking thenext steps of their developmental journey in an environment that does notpromote physical or emotional health and may harm their progress as well.Although an adolescent and an adult might receive what appears to be anequivalent sentence for a similar crime [e.g. 3 years for a felony assault],adolescents are paying for their crimes at a different point in their lifejourney; the impact of this experience may be more dramatic as a result.[253]Adult jails and prisons have a different purpose and aresubject to different standards than juvenile detention and residential centers,including in matters such as use of force.[254]For example, while the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice prohibits the useof pepper spray in its facilities, there is no such prohibition in adultfacilities.[255]As one federal judge observed, “[m]oving juveniles from the DJJ facilityto the central jail facility involved more than just a change in venues. Policyconsiderations and organizational cultures changed too.”[256]Although it was not a focus of our investigation, HumanRights Watch has found in our research that youth offenders serving time in adultfacilities are often victims and witnesses of violence.[257]The perpetrators can be other inmates, guards, or both.Kingston S., who was incarcerated in the Youthful Offendercamp at Sumter Correctional Institution (an adult prison), described a“test of heart” where other inmates assaulted him, and if he criedduring the beating, he had to give them his allotment from the canteen (whereinmates are allowed to purchase snacks).[258]Chris D. also spoke of the violence he experienced at the hands of other inmateswhile at Sumter’s Youthful Offender camp: “I’ve been flippedhere. I got my ass beat. I had my eye socket popped. It’s bad. Seen themstick broom sticks up people’s asses.”[259]In March 2013, the magistrate judge overseeing a lawsuitagainst the Polk County Jail issued a “Report and Recommendation”that included the following description of one particularly horrific incidentin which three boys attacked a fourth:[T]hree juvenile inmates were on lockdown in Foxtrot dorm,cell 8 (a blind cell dorm) when they beat a fourth cell mate, T.W., to thepoint of unconsciousness multiple times over the course of several hours. Theinmates first wrapped a pillowcase around T.W.’s neck and strangled himuntil he passed out. Then they hogtied him with a sheet and punched him in thehead. When T.W. eventually regained consciousness, his cell mates were whippinghim with wet towels. The perpetrators, anticipating that a deputy would makerounds soon, untied the victim while a deputy walked past the cell (Id.). The deputydid not notice anything out of the ordinary and walked on. T.W. was thenurinated on, sprayed in the face with a cleaning substance, and stripped of hisclothes. The perpetrators wrapped a sheet around his neck, tied the other end aroundthe bar on the window, and pulled the sheet tight until T.W. lostconsciousness. This was repeated three times until a deputy finally noticed thecommotion and broke up the assault.[260]The magistrate judge presiding over the Polk Countylitigation found that “[f]ights occur at the jail with substantialfrequency…. My review of the incident reports and protective actionreports approximates 25 fights over a ten-month period.” [261]Many young people spoke about mistreatment and indifferencefrom the corrections officers. Kyle F. alleged that the guards “beat ushere. They treat us like dirt. They only have a little section for Y[outhful]O[ffender]s. This is an adult camp. They need a better program for us.”[262]Ava L. observed that,[In adult jail] the [correction officers] treat you likeyou’re a piece of crap. Especially when they’re transferring youfrom one cell to another. I just can’t even explain. It’s horrible.In JDC [juvenile detention] it’s not really like that. In JDCyou’re with other girls and it’s just different. The [correctionofficers] at JDC are not as rough.[263]Samuel H. said that, in county jail “the COs[corrections officers] put their hands on you, scream at you. These COs can dowhatever they want to you. Juvenile COs were calmer. They talk to you,don’t put their hands on you.”[264]Terrence Q. felt that in county jail “officers are different. Some COsdon’t care. They just do stuff because they have a badge. In juvie theytalk to you, try to guide you.”[265]Others said that “in jail, for any little thing theyput you in [solitary] confinement”[266]and that they “were locked down most of the time.”[267]In 2012, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the solitary confinement ofyouth. That report found that children held in solitary confinement were oftenallowed little exercise, time outside their cells other than for showers, orcontact with loved ones. The effect on young people was harmful and in somecases devastating, resulting in suicide attempts.[268]Florida’s adult jails and prisons, moreover, are notdesigned to handle the educational, emotional, and social needs of teenagers.[269]One young person complained that “there’s nothing to do [in adultjail]. It was boring. Only select people were allowed to go to school.”[270]Another recalled that in juvenile detention “you were allowed outside alittle bit. [In county jail] all I was allowed to do was go out into thisconcrete slab. I forgot what the grass looked like.”[271]Veronica Limia, the lawyer who had been directly charged inadult court as a teenager, believes that conditions in adult jail are muchworse than in juvenile detention centers. “The detention center is builtto be like a school,” she pointed out. “Try finding a classroom ina jail. In juvenile facilities you have groups, you do learn a lot from othergirls going through the same thing. Once you’re in the county jailyou’re just doing time. That’s what it amounts to. You’re nolonger a kid.”[272]Samuel H., interviewed at the Orange County Jail, echoed this sentiment.“In [juvenile] detention you got counseling,” he said.“One-on-one counseling, support groups. Here I haven’t seen acounselor since I came in.”[273]Terrence Q. also recalled that juvenile detention offered counseling that adultjail did not. “They would send us to anger management and stuff [in juvenile].They try to help you out. It was helpful. I used to be very disrespectful andthat changed.”[274]Children who are placed in adult facilities are alsoseparated from their families in a more extreme way than they would have beenhad they remained in the juvenile justice system. Because a large number ofcounty jails provide for visitation only via video, many children who arecharged in adult court and housed in adult jails are prohibited from havingin-person visits with their families. Almost every young person Human RightsWatch spoke to described “video” visits in jail, where their familymembers would be in a separate physical location and they were only able to seethem through a video monitor. Many children found this aspect of incarcerationto be particularly upsetting. Calvin W. compared visitation in juveniledetention and adult jail: “In juvie they’re right in front of you.In jail it was by phone. Just seeing them walk away and you can’t evengive them a kiss or a hug, that’s bad. Not seeing your family is theworst thing.”[275]Thomas G. stated that in juvenile detention he “was able to touch and hugmy family, sit next to them, that kind of stuff. In county it was video so itwasn’t even in the same facility. I felt more alone. I felt like I justhadn’t gotten a hug in so long. It was crazy.”[276]Ava L. said that “in county you have to visit through a phone,you’re watching through a screen. It hurt ‘cause I couldn’tsee my mom for so long.” [277]Samuel H. said that visits with his mother in county jail where “you justhave these little screens” were “stressful. You at least want totouch your mom and you can’t even do that.”[278]Family separation is also an issue in prison. While prisons,unlike county jails, allow in-person visits, they are often located far fromdefendants’ hometowns, making family visits impractical. Furthermore,anybody who wants to visit a prison inmate must submit an application to theprison where that inmate is housed.[279]Those applications can only be obtained from the inmate herself, and eachinmate is only given 15 applications. According to the Florida Department ofCorrections, potential visitors can be disqualified for “a criminalhistory, providing false or inaccurate information on a visiting application,mailing an incomplete application, etc.”[280]Langston T. is serving a 3-year sentence in a prison that isapproximately a 3.5 hour drive from his hometown of West Palm Beach, Florida.Nine months into his sentence, he had not had a single visit from his family.“It’s a long trip,” he said.[281]Kingston S. had been at Sumter for over eight months without a visitor.[282]Another young inmate had been in for slightly over six months and his familyhad yet to get approved for visitation by the prison.[283]Kyle F., serving a prison sentence of 3 years, 6 months, and 14 days, had hisvisitors’ applications denied.[284]The difficulty that these children face in receiving visits is concerning bothbecause it contravenes international standards that emphasize family unity andbecause it flies in the face of years of studies that show that regular visitsfrom loved ones can help with rehabilitation and reduce recidivism.[285]Almost every child sentenced to prison time in Florida isplaced in one of several Youthful Offender facilities or “camps,”which house people younger than 24. Even if a child is not sentenced as aYouthful Offender (see text box), the Department of Corrections can, and oftendoes designate the child as a Youthful Offender for the purposes of placement.[286]But Youthful Offender facilities are hardly ideal conditions for children.Children in Youthful Offender institutions receive moreintensive programming, such as adult basic education and vocationalprogramming, than adults do.[287]However, according to the young people we spoke with, even Youthful Offenderprison facilities are harsh environments. Some young people interviewed forthis report, such as Chris D. and Kingston S., quoted above, experienced andwitnessed harrowing physical violence in Youthful Offender facilities.Furthermore, the mere fact that children in YouthfulOffender camps receive more programming than adults do does not mean that suchprogramming is sufficient to meet the needs of adolescents younger than 18. Asone Department of Justice study found,Although [Florida Department of Corrections] administratorsattempt to distinguish between very young offenders and young adults in housingassignments, no provisions are made to provide developmentally appropriateprogramming specific to the needs of 14-to-17-year-olds. Given the uniqueissues and needs of adolescents, the Florida program may compromise itseffectiveness by targeting too broad an age group.[288]Langston T. summarized his views on incarceration by saying“Adult prison? It ain’t a place to be. It’s just breathingand eating. You just a number in here.”[289]IV. Relevant Legal StandardsIn every other area of Florida Law, children are given anextra measure of scrutiny and protection…. [Y]et when a child is filedagainst in the adult criminal system, where the trauma and risks areextraordinary, no extra scrutiny or protection is afforded. This is especiallytroubling in light of the fact that at this stage the child is merely accusedand still presumed innocent.[290]—The Honorable Judge Ralph Stoddard, 13thJudicial CircuitDon’t brand a child with an adult felony recordbecause it puts a burden [on him] that might not be overcome. Don’t puthim in an adult criminal environment. Put [him] in an environment geared toaddressing the problems of young people.[291]—Harry Shorstein, former Florida 4thCircuit elected state attorneyFlorida LawFlorida courts have repeatedly held that juveniles have noabsolute right to be tried in juvenile court, and that transfer statutes areconstitutional, most recently in the case Hernandez v. State.[292]While Hernandez cited extensively to the Supreme Court’s Roper,Miller, and Graham decisions in vacating the sentence at issue, itdid not apply any of the reasoning in those cases to its discussion of directfile and reaffirmed the dispositive status of an earlier case, State v. Cain.State v. Cain interpreted a 1978 statute in Florida,which limited direct file in adult court to 16- and 17-year-olds. Under thatstatute, if a teen did not have two or more prior convictions, at least one ofwhich was for a felony, she could be transferred back to the juvenile system.[293]In upholding that version of direct file, the Cain court reasoned that“[t]here was no common law right to be specially treated as a juveniledelinquent instead of a criminal offender. Nor is there any inherent orconstitutional right to preferred treatment as a juvenile delinquent.”[294]US Federal LawWhile the US Supreme Court has never held the transfer ofchildren to adult court to be unconstitutional,[295]the court has long recognized that teens are not adults, and that their limitedlife experience, immaturity, and the fact that their brains have not fullydeveloped make them less culpable for their crimes and more amenable torehabilitation than adults. Over the past decade, the United States SupremeCourt has affirmed in four different decisions regarding the death penalty,[296]interrogations,[297]and life without parole[298]that people under age 18 are still developing and are inherently less culpablethan adults.International LawThe Child’s Rightto Special TreatmentInternational human rights law recognizes that peopleaccused of crimes are entitled to due process, and that children need specialprotection. Being charged and even convicted of a crime, no matter how serious,does not extinguish a child’s claim to just treatment at the hands ofgovernment. Children are entitled to all of the due process protections anadult would get and to additional accommodation because of their status aschildren.The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, specifically acknowledges theneed for special treatment of children in the criminal justice system andemphasizes the importance of their rehabilitation.[299]When children are accused of crimes, the ICCPR requires that “the procedureshall be such as will take account of their age and the desirability ofpromoting their rehabilitation” (emphasis added).[300]In other words, children’s special status is to be protected throughoutthe criminal process, not just at the sentencing stage. In the words of aprominent jurist, while article 14 of the ICCPR “does not expresslyrequire States parties to establish juvenile courts … they mustensure that criminal trials against juveniles are conducted differently thanthose against adults, this being normally accomplished by juvenilecourts.”[301]When the United States ratified the ICCPR, it attached alimiting reservation maintaining “the right, in exceptionalcircumstances, to treat juveniles as adults, notwithstanding paragraphs 2(b)and 3 of article 10 and paragraph 4 of article 14.”[302]The history of this reservation indicates that it was intended topermit—on an exceptional basis—the trial of children as adults andthe incarceration of children and adults in the same prison facilities. TheUnited States, as a co-sponsor of article 14, was keenly aware of the breadthand scope of its language. There is nothing in its reservation to suggest thatthe United States sought to reserve the right to try children as adults forpractically any crime at all and at the whim of a prosecutor, or to disregardthe special needs and vulnerabilities of children.[303]To the extent the reservation is interpreted broadly, it risks creating aloophole so broad as to allow for violation of the basic human rights ofchildren in conflict with the law. The United States should withdraw thereservation and in the meantime should refrain from using it to justify actionsthat otherwise violate the ICCPR.Although the US was one of the 78 members of the UN GeneralAssembly that voted unanimously to adopt the Convention on the Rights of theChild (CRC), it is also one of only two countries (the other being Somalia)that has not ratified it. Despite the fact that the US has not yet ratified theCRC, the Supreme Court has cited it favorably in its decisions interpreting the“cruel and unusual” clause of the Eighth Amendment as applied tojuveniles.[304]The CRC states that “in all actions concerning children … the best interestsof the child shall be a primary consideration.”[305]Furthermore, article 40 of the CRC states that every child accused ofcommitting a crime shall “be treated in a manner consistent with thepromotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces thechild's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others andwhich takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting thechild's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society.”[306]The Committee on the Rights of the Child, in a General Comment, has stated thatthe principle behind article 40 “requires that all professionals involvedin the administration of juvenile justice be knowledgeable about childdevelopment, the dynamic and continuing growth of children, what is appropriateto their well-being, and the pervasive forms of violence againstchildren.”[307]The US is also a member of the Organization of AmericanStates, and as such, is legally bound to protect and prevent violations of therights contained in the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man(“American Declaration”) and the American Convention on HumanRights, including the right of children to special protection, care and aid, asexpressed in article VII of the American Declaration and “the right tothe measures of protection required by his condition as a minor” asexpressed in article 19 of the American Convention.[308]The United Nations also promulgated a series of rules,which, while not binding, reflect international consensus and are consideredauthoritative. Most relevant to the issue of prosecutions of children in adultcourt are: the UN Minimum Standard Rules for the Administration of JuvenileJustice (The Beijing Rules), the UN Rules for the Protection of JuvenilesDeprived of their Liberty, and the UN Guidelines for the Prevention of JuvenileDelinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines). These rules provide further guidance oninternational standards for the treatment of children accused and convicted ofcrimes.Charging DecisionsInternational law does not bar prosecutorial discretion fromplaying a role in the charging process. Indeed, the Beijing Rules specificallycontemplate the use of prosecutorial discretion in juvenile proceedings, butthey state that “[e]fforts shall be made … to ensure sufficientaccountability at all stages and levels in the exercise of any suchdiscretion.”[309]The UN has spoken on the proper use of discretion, stating that, in decidingwhether to prosecute a juvenile in criminal court, a prosecutor should take thechild’s individual characteristics into account.[310]Similarly, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has stated that“those who exercise discretion should be specially qualified or trainedin the human rights of the child and child psychology to avoid any abuse of thediscretionary authority and to ensure that the measures ordered in any case areappropriate and proportionate.”[311]Florida’s direct file statute violates all of theseinternational standards by making prosecutors’ decisions to chargechildren directly in adult court unreviewable and final, and by failing torequire prosecutors to consider a child’s special status prior to makingthe direct file determination.Court ProcessesBy allowing prosecutors to charge children directly in adultcourt where they undergo the exact same process as adults, Florida is failingto provide children with due process protections that “take account oftheir age and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation,” asrequired by the ICCPR.[312]Rule 14.2 of the Beijing Rules states that criminal proceedings againstjuveniles “shall be conducive to the best interests of the juvenile andshall be conducted in an atmosphere of understanding, which shall allow thejuvenile to participate therein and to express herself or himselffreely.”[313]The Committee on the Rights of the Child has explained thatan accused child must “be able to effectively participate in the trial,and therefore needs to comprehend the charges, and possible consequences andpenalties, in order to direct the legal representative, to challenge witnesses,to provide an account of events, and to make appropriate decisions aboutevidence, testimony, and measure(s) to be imposed.”[314]The Committee has stated that “modified courtroom procedures andpractices” may be required in order to ensure that a child receives afair trial.[315]The CRC states that a child has the right to have his or her case heard“in the presence of … his or her parents or legal guardians”unless there is a determination that such familial involvement is not in thebest interests of the child.[316]The Committee on the Rights of the Child has read this requirement to mean that“[p]arents or legal guardians should also be present at the proceedingsbecause they can provide general psychological and emotional assistance to thechild.”[317]The youth interviewed for this report recounted attendingcriminal court proceedings that they did not understand, and feeling alonewithout their parents at their side. Many of them were unable to explain anyaspect of the process that resulted in their convictions. Unlike in juvenilecourt, there are no special steps taken to ensure that proceedings areconducted using vocabulary that children can understand. Criminal court proceedingsdo not encourage familial support. The fact that children are subjected toproceedings that are incomprehensible to them is at odds with notions offairness and due process, but it also offends notions of rehabilitation. It isdifficult to see how children can be expected to learn anything from aprocedure that they cannot understand.IncarcerationWhile Florida law requires jails and prisons to housejuveniles separately from adults, the fact remains that adult jails and prisonsare not designed or operated in ways that take the special needs of juvenilesinto account. By housing young defendants in adult jails and prisons both pre-and post-conviction, Florida violates international law.Article 10(2) of the ICCPR states that juveniles heldpre-trial must be “separated from adults and brought as speedily aspossible for adjudication.”[318]Further, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has stated thatpreventive detention is the most severe measure that can beapplied regarding someone accused of a crime. Therefore, it should be reservedfor the most exceptional cases, given the limits imposed by the right topresumption of innocence and the principles of necessity and proportionalitythat are essential in a democratic society…. When, however, preventivedetention is deemed necessary in the case of a child, it must be for theshortest period possible.[319]The young people who spoke to Human Rights Watch for thisreport uniformly spoke of the physical transfer from juvenile detention toadult jail as being traumatic and disruptive. To the extent that Floridacontinues to subject children to the jurisdiction of the adult criminal system,it should ensure that those children continue to be treated with considerationfor their needs by keeping them in the custody of the Department of JuvenileJustice pending disposition.A child’s right to treatment consistent with her ageand the desirability of her rehabilitation is not extinguished by conviction.Article 10(3) of the ICCPR requires the separation of convicted children fromadults and the provision of “treatment appropriate to their age and legalstatus.”[320] As in the pretrialcontext, housing children in adult prisons post-conviction violates thesestandards. While Florida has made an attempt to address the needs of youththrough its “Youthful Offender” camps, the fact remains that thosecamps are still prisons that are oriented primarily towards punishment ratherthan rehabilitation.Incarceration in adult prison also impinges upon the rightto family unity and the right of the child to maintain family ties, due to thefar-reaching restrictions on visitation in jails and prisons. Article 17 of theICCPR states that no one shall be “subjected to arbitrary or unlawfulinterference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence.”[321]Article 23 provides that “[t]he family is the natural and fundamentalgroup unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and thestate.”[322]The Convention on the Rights of the Child states “every child deprived ofliberty … shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her familythrough correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.”[323]The Committee on the Rights of the Child has elaborated that“[i]n order to facilitate visits, the child should be placed in afacility that is as close as possible to the place of residence of his/herfamily.”[324]For almost all of the people interviewed for this report, family contacts wereconstrained by the requirement in many jails that visits occur over video, andby the onerous visitor approvals process and long distances families musttravel to visit their loved ones in prison.Other RightsFlorida disenfranchises convicted felons for life.[325]This practice violates article 25 of the ICCPR, which states that every citizen“shall have the right and opportunity … (b) To vote and to beelected[.]”[326] While Article 25 doesnot completely disallow disenfranchisement pursuant to a criminal conviction,the UN Human Rights Committee has stated that “[i]f conviction for anoffence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of suchsuspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence.”[327]Lifetime disenfranchisement for any felony, no matter how minor, is clearlyarbitrary and disproportionate. Disenfranchisement imposed due to actionscommitted when a person was a mere adolescent is even more egregious.Of the more than 1 million people barred from voting inFlorida due to the state’s felony disenfranchisement law, nearly 1 in 3are African American men.[328]Florida’s felony disenfranchisement law is thus also inconsistent withthe principles of non-discrimination contained in the ICCPR and in the InternationalConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).Article 25 of the ICCPR prohibits racial discrimination with regard to votingrights. Article 5 of ICERD requires states parties to guarantee, withoutdistinction as to race, color, or national or ethnic origin, “[p]oliticalrights, in particular the right to participate in elections—to vote andto stand for election—on the basis of universal and equal suffrage…”[329]ICERD does require discriminatory intent for a finding of discrimination.Rather, it defines racial discrimination as any law or practice which has the“the purpose or effect” of restricting rights on the basisof race.[330]The right to privacy is also implicated by Florida’sdirect file law. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that“[n]o information shall be published that may lead to the identificationof a child offender because of its effect of stigmatization, and possibleimpact on his/her ability to have access to education, work, housing or to besafe.”[331]Rule 8 of the Beijing Rules further states that “[t]he juvenile’sright to privacy shall be respected at all stages in order to avoid harm beingcaused to her or him by undue publicity or by the process of labeling.”[332]These privacy concerns are well-founded, as Human Rights Watch learned inresearching this report. The stigma of a felony conviction is real andlong-lasting. Young defendants who had completed their sentences expressedfrustration at how difficult it was to put their past mistakes behind them, anddismay that their adolescent actions would brand them for life.V. ConclusionThe criminal punishment of any person is intended to furtherthe policy goals of retribution, rehabilitation, incapacitation, anddeterrence—all of which are meant to work together to protect publicsafety. When Florida’s lawmakers developed the direct file statute, theyundoubtedly had these goals in mind. Unfortunately, direct file in Floridafails to fulfill their intentions.First, Florida’s direct file statute does a poor jobof ensuring retribution for the offenses committed by children, including teens.Teens prosecuted directly in adult court in Florida have committed offenses,some of them serious, causing varying degrees of harm to persons and property.Ensuring justice for the victims of their crimes is an essential responsibilityof government, and retribution necessarily plays a part in that process. As theSupreme Court has stated, however, “The heart of the retributionrationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personalculpability of the criminal offender.”[333]Children can commit the same acts as adults, but by virtue of their immaturity,they cannot be as blameworthy or as culpable. They do not have adults’developed abilities to think, to weigh consequences, to make sound decisions,to control their impulses, and to resist group pressures; their brains areanatomically different, still evolving into the brains of adults. Thesecharacteristics of children are what inspired the creation of juvenile courtsin the first place.As the Supreme Court stated in Roper, the differencesbetween youth and adults “render suspect any conclusion that a juvenile fallsamong the worst offenders.”[334]Thus, the urge for vengeance must be tempered by a careful attention to theunique qualities of youth offenders. By giving prosecutors broad discretion tocharge Florida’s youth directly in adult court and subject them to asystem that pays scant attention to their diminished culpability, Florida’sdirect file system fails to achieve its retributive aims.Second, Florida’s decision to allow prosecutors todirectly charge children in adult court fails to effectively serve therehabilitative purpose of punishment. As this report has shown, rehabilitationcan be stymied by the special hardships inherent in receiving an adult felonyconviction, and in serving time in prison or on adult probation. Youth aredenied the educational, vocational, and other programs to develop their mindsand skills that juvenile justice systems were created to provide. Afterconviction, children are plagued by an adult felony record for the rest oftheir lives; they are denied the right to vote in Florida and their jobopportunities are severely impaired. Direct file not only underminesrehabilitative goals, it negates them.Third, deterrence of future crime is also ill-served bydirect file statutes. Supporters of adult punishment for children claim thatchildren who pause to consider the consequences before committing a crime willbe deterred best if they face charges in adult court and adult prison time. Butgiven what all parents know and science tells us about adolescents’limited abilities to think rationally or beyond the short term, it isquestionable whether the threat of adult punishment will deter them from crime.[335]Deterrence is also unlikely given that adolescents have difficulties graspingthe true significance of their adult felony convictions and sentences. Notsurprisingly, as summarized above, recent studies suggest as much: transfers toadult court are linked to increases, not decreases, in recidivism.Fourth, while the purposes of incapacitation are undeniablyserved by adult prison, the juvenile justice system also provides forincapacitation. Indeed, because the juvenile system can combine incapacitationwith rehabilitation, it is able to serve the overall goal of protecting publicsafety as well as or better than the adult justice system in juvenile cases.Florida’s direct file law and practice fail to effectivelyserve the purposes of punishment, violate the international human rightsobligations of the United States, which are binding on the state of Florida,and are unnecessary to meet public safety goals. Children should be heldaccountable for their crimes. This is an important and fundamental human rightsobligation of government. But ensuring that children are treated in a mannerthat takes into account their culpability, their particular needs, and theirunique capacity to grow and change, is also a cornerstone of internationalhuman rights law. Both can be achieved by the state of Florida if it ends itsunduly harsh and unnecessary system of directly charging children in adultcourts.AcknowledgmentsAlba Morales, researcher in the US Program of Human RightsWatch, researched and wrote this report.

But see Griffin et al., “Trying Juveniles asAdults,” https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/232434.pdf,p. 8 (stating that Florida had prosecutorial direct file laws on the booksbefore 1970).[54]Florida Statute §985.557.[55]If a juvenile judge finds that the allegations set out in the delinquencypetition are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, she may withhold an adjudicationof delinquency and impose a program or other conditions on the child. If thechild violates those conditions, the judge may enter an adjudication of delinquency“after a hearing to establish the lack of compliance, but without furtherevidence of the state of delinquency[.]” “Adjudicatory Hearings; WithheldAdjudications; Orders of Adjudication,” Florida Statute §985.35(4)(a).[56]In Florida, those felonies are: arson; sexual battery; robbery; kidnapping;aggravated child abuse; aggravated assault; aggravated stalking; murder;manslaughter; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructivedevice or bomb; armed burglary and related offenses; aggravated battery; anylewd or lascivious offense committed upon or in the presence of a person lessthan 16 years of age; carrying, displaying, using, threatening, or attemptingto use a weapon or firearm during the commission of a felony; grand theft;possessing or discharging any weapon or firearm on school property; homeinvasion robbery; carjacking; and grand theft of a motor vehicle. FloridaStatute § 985.557. California’s direct file statute lists 21felonies for which children as young as 14 can be charged in adult court.California Welfare and Institutions Code §§ 707(d)(d)(2).[57]The statute does not define “violent crime against a person.”[58]A finding of guilt in juvenile court is referred to as an“adjudication” rather than a conviction.[59]Forcible felonies are defined as: “treason; murder; manslaughter; sexualbattery; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; robbery; burglary; arson;kidnapping; aggravated assault; aggravated battery; aggravated stalking;aircraft piracy; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructivedevice or bomb; and any other felony which involves the use or threat ofphysical force or violence against any individual.” “ForcibleFelony,” Florida Statute § 776.08.[60]This subsection of the statute further says that it is not applicable“when the state attorney has good cause to believe that exceptionalcircumstances exist which preclude the just prosecution of the juvenile inadult court.” The inclusion of this exception in this subsection appearssuperfluous since the larger statute also contains an “escapehatch” provision.[61]The crimes, enumerated in “Possession or Use of Weapon; Aggravated Battery;Felony Reclassification; Minimum Sentence,” Florida Statute §775.087(2)(a)1.a.-q, are:  murder; sexual battery; robbery; burglary;arson; aggravated assault; aggravated battery; kidnapping; escape; aircraftpiracy; aggravated child abuse; aggravated abuse of an elderly person ordisabled adult; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructivedevice or bomb; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; aggravated stalking; anddrug trafficking.[62]Prosecutors, of course, have broad discretion in deciding which charges tobring. See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978) (“solong as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committedan offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, andwhat charge to file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely inhis discretion.”); see also Lanza-Kaduce et al., “Juvenile Transferto Criminal Court Study: Final Report,” http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/juveniletransfers.pdf,p. 70.[63]Florida Statute § 985.557(3)(a).[64]“Theft,” Florida Statute § 812.014(2)(c)(6).[65]“Penalties; Applicability of Sentencing Structures; Mandatory Minimum Sentencesfor Certain Reoffenders Previously Released From Prison,” Florida Statute§ 775.082(3)(d).[66]While 34 states have “once an adult, always an adult” provisions,only two other jurisdictions—the District of Columbia andOklahoma—automatically treat a child as an adult for any subsequentoffense. See District of Columbia Code § 16-2307(h); Oklahoma Statutestitle 10A, §§ 10A-2-2-403(C), 10A-2-5-204(G), 10A-2-5-205(B). Theother 29 states with such provisions place limitations on when a child with aprior adult conviction can be sent to adult court.[67]From 2003 until 2008, the latest years for which data is available, judicialwaivers accounted for 4 percent of transfers in Florida. See Griffin et al.,“Trying Juveniles as Adults,” https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/232434.pdf,p. 18.[68]Human Rights Watch interview with William Cervone, 8th Circuit State Attorney,Gainesville, Florida, May 31, 2013. See also Robert O. Dawson,“Judicial Waiver in Theory and Practice,” in The ChangingBorders of Juvenile Justice, ed. Jeffrey Fagan and Franklin E. Zimring(Chicago:University of Chicago Press, 2000), p. 74 (“A prosecutor is unlikely toforgo direct filing but pursue judicial waiver. In a situation in which bothare available, a prosecutor will almost always choose direct filing.).[69]Only a small minority of cases reach adult courts through indictment, where agrand jury reviews the evidence. An even smaller percentage reach adult courtby means of a contested judicial waiver hearing, where both the defense and theprosecutor can present arguments and the judge can consider factors such as thechild’s amenability to reform if given age-appropriate services. Dataprovided by Florida’s Department of Juvenile Justice indicates that 0.6percent of transfers occurred via judicial waiver. However, when Human RightsWatch contacted the state attorney for the 14th Judicial Circuit, whichaccounted for an unusually high percentage of judicial waiver hearings, arepresentative from his office said they had conducted no judicial waiverhearings during that time period.[70]Additionally, there are small numbers of other non-felony or non-misdemeanoroffenses and unknown felony offenses.[71]In the late 1990s, a trio of criminology professors conducted an in-depth studycomparing 227 cases prosecuted in Florida’s juvenile justice system in1995 with an equal number of “matching” cases where juveniles hadbeen prosecuted in adult court during that same year. Lonn Lanza-Kaduce, CharlesE. Frazier, and Donna M. Bishop, “Juvenile Transfers in Florida: TheWorst of the Worst?,” University of Florida Journal of Law &Public Policy, vol. 10 (1999), p. 292. Cases were considered to match basedon seven criteria: offense, number of counts, prior history, most serious prioroffense, age, gender, and race. Ibid., p. 289. The authors found some smalldifferences between the two groups in the aggregate—those sent to adultcourt, for example, had on average slightly longer prior records. Ibid., p.305. When they looked at each matched pair using a 12-variable index they haddeveloped to measure seriousness of the cases, however, they found thatchildren prosecuted in adult court “did not stand out as being clearlyworse in most of the paired comparisons.” In fact, the researchers foundthat “in 7% [of the matched pairs], the transfer case was lesssevere.” Ibid., p. 308.[72]The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice uses the “Positive AchievementChange Tool,” http://www.djj.state.fl.us/docs/partners-providers-staff/cpact-pre-screen-assessment.pdf?sfvrsn=10(accessed March 19, 2014) to assess a juvenile’s risk to reoffend.[73]Two Sample T-Test, p=3.75e-7.[74]The 16th Circuit is an outlier from other circuits, as it has a verylow number of arrests.[75]There is no disaggregated data for drug felonies and the sample sizes forviolent felony offenses are small.[76]This racial disparity echoes disparities found throughout the United Statescriminal justice system. Racial disparities permeate every aspect of thecriminal process—from what behavior gets criminalized, to who getsarrested, to what sentences they receive if convicted.

Forexample, according to a 2008 Human Rights Watch report, African Americans were10.1 times more likely than whites to go to prison for drug offenses. AnAfrican American man was 11.8 times more likely than a white man to go toprison for a drug offense, while an African American woman was 4.8 times morelikely to go to prison than a white woman for a drug offense.

The study found that while“adolescents and older participants behaved comparably when tested alone… only adolescents took significantly more risks when observed by peersthan when alone, as evidenced by a significantly increased number of”decisions to go through the changing light and resulting crashes. Brain imagingconducted as part of the study revealed “greater activation” in thereward-perceiving parts of the brain in adolescents when they were in a peergroup, but no such greater activation when adolescents were alone, or foradults in any circumstance.
