Many drop out of school and work in conditions that canbe hazardous due to pesticides, dangerous equipment, and extreme heat.Children working on Israeli settlements pick, clean, andpack asparagus, tomatoes, eggplants, sweet peppers, onions, and dates, amongother crops. Children whom Human Rights Watch interviewed said they begin workas early as 5:30 or 6 a.m. and usually work around 8 hours a day, six or sevendays a week. During peak harvest periods, some children reported working up to12 hours a day, over 60 hours a week. Some children described pressure fromsupervisors to keep working, and not to take breaks.Although international law, as well as Israeli andPalestinian law, sets 15 as the minimum age of employment, many children toldHuman Rights Watch that they began working at age 13 or 14. Even youngerchildren work part-time, and one boy interviewed by Human Rights Watch saidthat he worked together with a boy who was only 10 years old.The work that children perform can be both grueling andhazardous. Some children who work on settlement farms described vomiting, dizziness,and skin rashes after spraying pesticides with little protection, andexperienced body pain or numbness from carrying heavy pesticide containers ontheir back. Many suffered cuts from using sharp blades to cut onions, sweetpeppers, and other crops. Heavy machinery also causes injuries. One child saidhe saw another child who was pinned under a tractor that rolled over. Anotherboy said he caught his finger in a date-sorting machine. Children risk fallsfrom climbing ladders to prune and pick dates. Two children had been stung byscorpions while working in settlers’ fields.Temperatures in the fields often exceed 40 degrees Celsiusin summer (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) and can be as high as 50 degreesCelsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in greenhouses. Some children described nauseaand other symptoms indicating they were susceptible to heat stroke from workingin such extreme temperatures. One boy told Human Rights Watch that he hadrepeatedly fainted while working in a hot greenhouse.None of the children interviewed received medical insuranceor social insurance benefits, and the majority of those who needed medicaltreatment due to work injuries or illness said they had to pay their ownmedical bills and transportation costs to Palestinian hospitals. ThreePalestinian children who got sick or were injured while working and had to gohome or to the hospital said they were not even paid for the hours they hadworked that day, much less for the time they had to take off work.To research this report, Human Rights Watch interviewed 38children and 12 adults in Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley who saidthey were employed to work on settlement farms in the area, as well as teachersand principals in those communities, Israeli and Palestinian labor lawyers,development-agency staff and labor rights advocates. Children are a minority ofPalestinians employed on settlement farms, but most Palestinian children whowork in settlements do so in the agricultural sector. All of the children andadults Human Rights Watch interviewed said they took the work due to a lack ofalternative jobs and because of the dire economic conditions faced by theirfamilies – conditions for which Israel’s policies throughout theoccupied West Bank including the Jordan Valley, which severely restrictPalestinians’ access to land, water, agricultural inputs likefertilizers, and their ability to transport goods, are largely responsible. One18-year-old said that he quit school in Grade 10 because, as he explained,“so what if you get an education, you’ll wind up working for thesettlements.”The vast majority of the children working in settlementswhom Human Rights Watch interviewed said they had dropped out of school.Teachers and principals told Human Rights Watch that children often dropped outaround Grade 8, or age 14. Of the 33 children that Human Rights Watchinterviewed who were then working full-time in agricultural settlements, 21 haddropped out of schools in Grade 10 or earlier; the other 12 dropped out of secondaryschool in Grade 11 or 12. Other children worked part-time while still attendingschool, often at the expense of their studies. “It’s very obviouswhich kids go to work in the settlements, because they are exhausted inclass,” said a school administrator.All the children Human Rights Watch interviewed said thatthey were working to provide money for their families. When asked why childrenchose to work, a Palestinian middleman who supplied Palestinian workers tosettlers told an Israeli human rights worker: “Ask [the children] if theyhave any bread in the house.” Palestinian children and adults who work insettlements told Human Rights Watch that they hoped the international communitywould pressure Israel to end settlement agriculture and lift relatedrestrictions on Palestinian land-use, access to water, freedom of movement, andmarket access, and instead, allow Palestinians to cultivate their own lands andto create an economic environment in which they could support their children tostay in school and receive an education. In some cases, Palestinian workerssaid that they worked on farmland that Israel had, in violation ofinternational law, confiscated from their own villages and allocated tosettlements.Most of the children and adults live in villages in theJordan Valley. Some of the children came from villages elsewhere in the WestBank, moved to the Jordan Valley, and lived for months at a time in emptywarehouses there, working in settlements during the day, in order to save onthe cost and time required to travel from home.Children working in agricultural settlements earn very lowwages. All of the Palestinian adults and children whom Human Rights Watchinterviewed earned far less than the Israeli minimum wage, which was 23 shekels($6.20) per hour for adults and between 16 and 18 shekels ($4.30 and $4.86) perhour for children at the time the research for this report was conducted. Mostearned only 60 to 70 shekels per day ($16 to $19), and some children took home50 shekels per day ($13.50) after paying for transportation to and fromsettlements to work; most workdays lasted 7 or 8 hours, except during peakharvesting times.[1]Military orders issued by the Israeli military commander in the West Bank makeprovisions of Israel’s domestic Minimum Wage Law applicable toPalestinian workers in settlements. However, many children either did not knowthat Israel had a minimum wage law or that the law’s provisions weresupposed to apply to Palestinians working in settlements.All the children Human Rights Watch interviewed said theywere employed through unwritten agreements with Palestinian middlemen workingon behalf of Israeli settlers. Israeli settlers’ practice of usingPalestinian middlemen to hire Palestinian laborers, including children, meansthat there is no work contract or any other documents linking the childrendirectly to the settler-employer. In practice, it is extremely difficult forPalestinians who work in settlements to demand their rights under Israeli laborlaw without such proof of employment. According to a Palestinian middleman,workers are paid “in cash, [get] no pay slips, and there are no [work]permits, so there is no paper trail to demand severance pay or anythingelse.”Most labor disputes that Palestinian workers and middlemendescribed to Human Rights Watch involved severance pay, presumably becauseworkers demanding severance pay have already lost their jobs and so have lessto lose from making legal claims than workers who are employed. Israel’sMinimum Wage Law – which is applicable, via military orders, toPalestinian workers in settlements – states that workers cannot waivetheir rights to minimum wages, but none of the Palestinian children or adultsinterviewed said they expected or had demanded to be paid minimum wages. ThePalestinian middleman believed that if a worker asked a settler-employer for araise, “they’d fire you.”International Law ViolationsHuman Rights Watch found many examples of children workingin Israeli agricultural settlements in violation of international law as wellas Israeli and Palestinian law. Both Israel and Palestine are party to theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and to theConvention on the Rights of the Child, which recognize the right of the childto be protected from being exploited economically and performing work that islikely to be hazardous or interfere with the child’s schooling.[2]In addition, Israel is party to International Labor Organization(ILO) Conventions 138 and 182. Under those conventions, Israel has affirmed aminimum age of employment of 15 (permitting “light work” forchildren of ages 13 and 14) and agreed to prohibit hazardous work for any childunder age 18. Israeli law provides that a child may be employed only as anapprentice during the period of compulsory schooling (up to tenth grade inIsrael).Children of age 14 are permitted to work during the summervacation, but only in positions that are relatively undemanding and are nothazardous to their health. Israeli authorities apply national laws to Israelichildren in settlements, including labor laws and education laws that makebasic education compulsory and free.Israeli labor courts and the country’s Supreme Courthave ruled consistently that Israeli labor law protections extend toPalestinian workers in settlements. Israeli military orders have incorporatedsome domestic labor laws, including the laws on minimum wage and “foreignworkers,” which Israel applies to Palestinians working in settlements in theoccupied West Bank. However, Israeli authorities have failed to enforce theselaws and did not conduct a single labor inspection in agricultural settlementsin 2013, and few or none in other recent years, since at least 2010. None ofthe Palestinian children working in settlement agriculture whom we interviewedhad ever spoken to an Israeli labor inspector.According to Israeli officials, the lack of enforcement isthe result of a lack of clearly allocated responsibility between the Israeliministry of economy and the Civil Administration, a branch of the military.Israeli officials have made similar excuses for years. In reality, Israel hasturned a blind eye to violations of Israeli labor laws vis-à-visPalestinian workers in the settlement agricultural sector.As this report describes, Israel’s domestic laws onchildren and work generally reflect its international obligations, and Israeliauthorities have partly acknowledged a responsibility to enforce theirprotections for the benefit of Palestinians working in settlements, even asthey fail consistently to do so. However, we do not call on Israel to extendits domestic legal order, including workers’ rights protections, intooccupied territory. The international law of belligerent occupation, applicableto the West Bank today, prohibits Israel, as the occupying power, fromextending the jurisdiction of its domestic laws into Palestine as though itwere the sovereign. Israel has unlawfully applied domestic laws in occupiedterritory for the benefit of Israeli settlers, such as laws on theestablishment of companies.Israel’s civilian settlements in the occupied WestBank depend on its unlawful policies of transferring its civilian populationinto occupied territory and appropriating land and other resources there forthe settlements. Israel is obliged to dismantle the settlements, and also to preventabuses against Palestinians working in settlements, even though doing so wouldnot mitigate the unlawful nature of the settlements themselves.Palestinian law makes 10 years of primary educationcompulsory and free for children, prohibits employing children under 15 andemploying children aged 15 to 18 in hazardous work – such as usingpesticides and carrying heavy loads. However, Palestinian authorities lack theauthority and capacity to enforce these laws in either settlements or mostrural Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley where the children live,both of which fall under Israel’s exclusive jurisdiction and control. Ina handful of cases, Palestinian authorities have arrested Palestinian middlemenwhile they were traveling through areas that are under Palestinianjurisdiction, and prosecuted them for hiring children to work in settlementsand other labor-law violations.Expanding SettlementAgriculture, Restrictive Anti-Palestinian PoliciesAnother factor underlying abuses against Palestinianchildren in settlements are Israel’s policies that severely restrict thetraditional Palestinian economic activity in the Jordan Valley –agriculture – while supporting settlement agriculture. An Israelimilitary order revoked Palestinians’ role in planning and zoning in the61 percent of the West Bank under exclusive Israeli control, including most ofthe Jordan Valley, but settlers enjoy a different, preferential zoning regimeand are represented on planning bodies. (About 30 percent of the land area ofthe West Bank lies in the Jordan Valley and Dead Sea areas.) About 80,000Palestinians live in the Jordan Valley, comprising almost 90 percent of itspopulation, but Israeli restrictions on the movement of Palestinians mean thatmore than 94 percent of the Jordan Valley is off-limits to Palestinian landuse. By contrast, Israel has allocated about 86 percent of the land in theJordan Valley to the jurisdiction of settlement regional councils, which lookafter the interests of the 9,500 settlers who reside in the Valley.An Israeli group critical of land use by Israeli settlementsin the West Bank, Kerem Navot, documented that even after Israel had allocatedlarge tracts of land to agricultural settlements in the Jordan Valley in the1970s and 80s, the amount of land cultivated by those settlements grew by anadditional 16 percent from 1997 to 2012; meanwhile, some Palestinians in theJordan Valley pay rent to settlers to use farmland that Israel unlawfullyappropriated without compensation and transferred to the settlements for free.The amount of water provided to the Israeli settlers in theJordan Valley by Israeli wells there, operated by the Israeli national watercarrier, is one-quarter of the water supply of the entire Palestinianpopulation of the West Bank. The World Bank reported in 2013 that Israelirestrictions on Palestinians’ ability to irrigate agricultural land andto export crops cost the Palestinian economy US $704 million per year, and thatthe Palestinian agricultural sector in the West Bank in 2013 employed fewerpeople and generated less revenue than it had 15 years previously. According toWorld Bank data, poverty rates in Palestinian localities in the Jordan Valleyare among the highest in the West Bank, at between 28.2 and 33.5 percent.Israeli restrictions on Palestinian land-use, freedom ofmovement, and market access, have generated unemployment and poverty in theJordan Valley and the rest of the occupied West Bank, and left fewopportunities for hundreds of Palestinian families other than to send theirchildren to work on the farms of illegal settlements, where many of theirparents also work. Knowing that families rely on the work, Israeli settleremployers exploit Palestinian workers, including children, while Israel turns ablind eye.Israeli settlement agriculture benefits from labor abuses thatkeep employment costs low. Settlement agriculture also benefits from Israeliplanning and zoning policies in the West Bank. For example, Israel hasappropriated land and water from Palestinians and transferred these assets toIsraeli settlers, provided subsidies to settlers that are denied toPalestinians, and implemented restrictions on movements that hinder or preventPalestinian farmers from accessing markets. Such policies, which violateIsrael’s obligations as the occupying power to respect the rights ofprotected persons in occupied territory and prohibit it from transferring itsown civilians there, further impoverish Palestinian families, leaving manyparents to say they feel they have few alternatives to seeking work insettlements and often sending their children to work there as well.In accordance with its obligations as the occupying power inthe West Bank, Israel should dismantle the settlements, limit its use of land,water and other resources in occupied territory to what is strictly necessaryfor military purposes, and lift unlawful restrictions on Palestinian access tothose resources.Palestinian ChildWorkers in Settlement AgricultureThe Israeli government does not have figures for the numberof Palestinian children working in settlements; none of the children havewritten contracts, official work permits, or other forms of documentation. ThePalestinian Authority’s Central Bureau of Statistics has not reported onthe number of children working in Israeli agricultural settlements; it shouldseek data on the issue of child labor in settlements during a planned child laborsurvey to be carried out in 2015.[3] A WestBank humanitarian not-for-profit group that works in Palestinian communities inthe Jordan Valley, the Ma’an Development Center, estimates that duringthe summer season – when the most crops need harvesting and children areout of school – up to 1,000 Palestinian children work in Israeliagricultural settlements.Palestinian children are apparently a minority of thePalestinian workers in Israeli agricultural settlements, but the agriculturalsector nonetheless appears particularly susceptible to employing Palestinianchildren, because most agricultural workers do not have documentation.Palestinians who work in settlements in other sectors, such as manufacturing orconstruction, typically work inside the settlements themselves. To be able toenter a settlement for work or any other reason, Palestinians must obtainofficial Israeli permits. Settler-employers apply to the Israeli military forthese permits on behalf of their Palestinian employees, whom the military subjectsto security screening; among other information, the permits list thePalestinians’ names, ages and employers. The Israeli military stated in2013 that it does not issue work permits to Palestinian children under 18.[4]By contrast, all the children and adults working in settlement agriculture whomHuman Rights Watch interviewed said they work in greenhouses and fields on landlocated outside the settlement gates – consistent with reports by Israeliand Palestinian rights groups. Settler-employers are thus able to employPalestinians without obtaining the military permits, which could be used inIsraeli labor courts as evidence of violations of Israeli labor laws.The financial interest of settler-employers to keep laborcosts low is served when they fail to register their Palestinian employees withthe Israeli authorities – unlike Israeli employees, who are registered.Failure to register the employees makes it easier to avoid the Israeli legalrequirement to pay minimum wage and other benefits to Palestinians.Agricultural settlements also employ Israeli citizens, butso far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, there have been nocomplaints by Israeli employees on agricultural settlements indicating thatthey suffer widespread abusive practices similar to those faced by Palestinianworkers, or that Israeli children are similarly employed in violation ofIsraeli labor laws, or work in similar jobs to Palestinian children.Flouting Labor LawsAll the Palestinian workers whom Human Rights Watch interviewedsaid settlers hired Palestinian middlemen who take charge of supplyingagricultural workers and paying them in cash. None of the 50 Palestinians– including 38 children – whom Human Rights Watch selected tointerview during visits to Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley, whosaid they were employed in agricultural settlements in the area, receivedcontracts, pay slips, permits, or any other documents required by Israeli law.Such documents would provide evidence linking the workers to theIsraeli-citizen employer on whose behalf they work. Without them, it isextremely difficult for Palestinians working in settlements to demand theirrights under Israeli labor laws that apply to them, including the minimum wagelaw.Some Palestinian workers, often with the help of the Israelirights group that filed the Supreme Court case, Kav LaOved (Worker’sHotline), have sued Israeli settlers, usually to obtain the severance paylegally due them when they were made redundant. However, cases where Palestinianworkers have pursued their cases in court are rare. Even in cases wherePalestinian workers can produce evidence documenting their claims, many reachan agreement with their erstwhile settler-employer and receive less than theyallege they are owed. Several Palestinian workers told Human Rights Watch thatthey feared to push for their rights, because they were aware of cases ofPalestinian workers who successfully sued their employers, demanding theirlegal rights, only to find that their employer then warned other settlers notto hire them, or their children. One Palestinian man said that after twoworkers he knew had won court cases against settler employers, “no onewould hire them” or their sons; another agricultural worker said he agreedto receive less severance pay from his employer than he was owed by law, forfear that he or his children would be “blacklisted” from working insettlements. The International Labor Organization, Israeli and Palestinianrights groups have also reported the “blacklisting” by settlers ofPalestinians who seek their rights in court.Third State andBusiness ResponsibilitiesOther states and multilateral organizations have criticizedIsrael’s unlawful policies in the Jordan Valley, but without apparenteffect. For example, the International Labor Organization has repeatedlyexpressed concern about abuses against Palestinian child workers in thesettlement agricultural sector and the lack of labor inspections, but thisprompted no improvements. Israel has continued to thwart efforts byinternationally funded humanitarian agencies to assist Palestinians in thearea, and had issued demolition orders or orders to stop construction workagainst 39 Palestinian schools, serving 4,500 students, in areas of the WestBank under its exclusive control as of 2013.[5]Meanwhile, foreign countries’ ongoing traderelationships with Israeli settlements have helped to sustain settlement-basedbusinesses, thus undermining these governments’ humanitarian as well aspolitical efforts to support Palestinians and the Palestinian economy. SomeEuropean states are among the main donors of humanitarian assistance toPalestinians in the Jordan Valley, yet in 2012, the last date for which figuresare available, European countries imported goods and produce from Israelisettlements in the West Bank estimated to be worth 15 times more than the goodsthey imported from Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.[6]Israel controls all exports from Palestinian territory, and effectivelyrequires most Palestinian businesses to use Israeli exporters.Israeli law and practice does not distinguish settlementproducts from products made in Israel, and Israel exports agricultural andother goods produced in settlements located in the West Bank under the“Made in Israel” and “Product of Israel” labels. Israeldoes not publish disaggregated figures for the export destination ofsettlement-grown produce, but based on news reports, and information fromsettlement and company websites, Europe is the main export market, with someagricultural exports to the US by Israeli companies that work in settlements inthe Jordan Valley.The EU has moved to exclude Israeli settlement products fromthe preferential tariff treatment provided to Israeli goods under the EU-IsraelAssociation Agreement. However, under a “Technical Arrangement” tothe Agreement, Israel in practice bundles settlement products together withIsraeli goods for export to Europe and claims tariff-free status for the entireshipment; the Arrangement places the burden of distinguishing eligible Israeliproducts and excluding ineligible settlement goods on European importers, whomust do so by scrutinizing the postal codes designating the origin of eachbatch. Seventeen EU member states have issued advice to businesses that theyneeded to consider the legal, financial and reputational risks of involvementwith settlement trade, but have not instructed businesses to end such trade. TheUS in practice continues to grant preferential treatment to Israeli settlementproducts under the US-Israel Free Trade Agreement. The EU offers tradeincentives to developing countries that take steps to combat child labor, buthas not undertaken to restrict trade in products made with child labor,including products from Israeli agricultural settlements. The US Department ofLabor maintains and publishes a list of more than 350 products from foreigncountries that are produced with the use of forced labor or child labor inother countries, but has not included Israeli settlement products on the list.With Israel showing no sign that it will abide by itsinternational legal obligations as an occupying power to dismantle civiliansettlements in occupied territory, it is incumbent on other states to takemeasures to ensure that they do not contribute to or benefit fromIsrael’s continuing violation of international humanitarian law,including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and international human rightslaw.The Fourth Geneva Convention specifically prohibits thetransfer of an occupying power’s civilian population into the occupiedterritory, while several international human rights conventions prohibitdiscrimination and guarantee children’s rights.Given the widespread, discriminatory abuses againstPalestinian children in Israeli settlements that this report documents, as wellas Israel’s continuing violation of international law as it relates tooccupation, foreign states where businesses are domiciled that trade withIsrael, should insist that Israeli authorities and exporters clearlydistinguish between products that derive from settlements and those producedwithin Israel. States that enter into trade agreements with Israel should instructbusinesses domiciled in their jurisdictions not to import agricultural or otherproducts that derive from Israeli settlements and to formally certify theircompliance with this requirement. Businesses should not provide products orservices that support Israeli agricultural settlements.RecommendationsTo IsraelProhibit all settlers from employingPalestinian children, whether directly or through middlemen, for work inviolation of international law, in particular, any employment of children underthe age of 15, or employment of children under age 18 in hazardous work.Impose penalties on employers or contractorswho illegally employ children.Lift unlawful restrictions on Palestiniansin occupied territory that contribute to Palestinian poverty and unemployment,and to the vulnerability of Palestinian children to rights abuses on settlementfarms and dropping out of school, including restrictions on Palestinian freedomof movement, access to water and electricity, and land use such as foragriculture, housing, and educational facilities.Abide by its obligations as the occupyingpower and dismantle civilian settlements in the occupied West Bank.To the European Unionand EU Member StatesRevise the “TechnicalArrangement” of the EU/Israel Association Agreement to require Israel toexclude settlement agricultural products from shipments of Israeli goods eligible forpreferential tariff treatment.Instruct European importers to cease importsof settlement agricultural products.To the United StatesRevise the US/Israel Free Trade Agreement toexclude settlement agricultural products.Instruct US importers to cease imports ofsettlement agricultural products.ToPalestineImprove enforcement of laws on children’sfree and compulsory education and prohibitions on child labor in areas wherethere is Palestinian jurisdiction, including by disciplining or prosecutingmiddlemen when the Israeli abusers fall outside of Palestinian jurisdiction.Seek membership in the International Labor Organization(ILO), and ratify ILO Convention 138 on the Minimum Age for Admission toEmployment and ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.[7]Continue to press foreign governments tocease imports of settlement agricultural products.To Businesses Active in Israeli SettlementsCease activities in the Israeli settlementagricultural sector, including providing equipment or services, and exportingor marketing agricultural produce.MethodologyHuman Rights Watch conducted preliminary interviews for thisreport in Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley in 2011, and thenreturned to conduct principal interviews from March through July 2014. Aresearcher and research assistant interviewed 38 Palestinian children (under 18years old), and 12 adults, all of whom worked at the time in the settlementagricultural sector in the Jordan Valley, as well as 5 adults who did not workin settlements but whose children did. Of the 38 children, 30 said they beganworking in settlements before age 15; 20 of the children were younger than age15 at the time of the interviews. The youngest child interviewed who wasworking in a settlement was 11 years old; the youngest child working full-timein a settlement and who had dropped out of school was 13 years old at the timeof the interview. Human Rights Watch also interviewed three Palestiniansemployed as “middlemen” by settler-employers to provide Palestinianworkers; three primary and secondary school teachers, three school principals,and two guidance counsellors; two Palestinian trade union representatives; thedirector of a Palestinian youth sports club; the mayors of five Palestiniancommunities; two doctors and two pharmacists who had provided medical treatmentto or had prescribed medicines to Palestinian children who worked insettlements; and a labor lawyer.Researchers identified approximately half the intervieweesat random by asking residents of Palestinian communities located nearsettlements in the Jordan Valley where they worked and their ages, and bycontacting other children whom the interviewees identified.In other cases, Palestinian teachers and community leadershelped identify interviewees. Approximately half the interviews were conductedin one-on-one settings, while the others were conducted in settings with otherspresent, such as in school offices, youth centers, and private homes. Allinterviews were conducted in Arabic with a translator. Human Rights Watchadvised all interviewees of the purposes of the research, that they couldterminate the interview at any time if they wished, and that they would deriveno pecuniary or other direct benefit from assisting Human Rights Watch withthis research.In some cases, Palestinian interviewees requested that HumanRights Watch not publish their full names, for fear of being fired bysettler-employers. This report identifies all children and most adults who wereinterviewed by a single initial and does not include identifying details.In this report, “child” and “children”are used to refer to anyone under the age of 18, consistent with usage underinternational law.Human Rights Watch also interviewed researchers and fieldworkers of non-governmental organizations, including Kav LaOved, an Israeliworkers’ rights group that provides legal services to Palestinian as wellas foreign workers; the Ma’an Development Center, a Palestinianhumanitarian group; the Jordan Valley Solidarity Campaign, and advocacy group;and staff in the Jericho office of the Palestinian General Federation of TradeUnions.Human Rights Watch met with Palestinian authorities andsought to meet Israeli civil and military authorities responsible for labor lawenforcement in the West Bank, and provided questions to Palestinian and Israeliauthorities based on preliminary research. Israeli officials did not respond torequests for meetings or written questions.I. Background: Israel’sControl of Land in the Jordan ValleyThe Jordan Valley covers about 30 percent of the West Bank,extending from the 1949 armistice line in the north to the Dead Sea in thesouth, and from the Jordan River in the east to the eastern slopes of the hillsthat run through the middle of the West Bank.[8] Theriver, which originates in the Sea of Galilee or Kinneret in northern Israel,runs south through the West Bank and flows into the Dead Sea, and forms anatural and political boundary between the West Bank and Jordan. The valley ismostly arid and receives little rainfall. In summer, temperatures there canexceed 45 degrees Celsius.About 80,000 Palestinians live in the Jordan Valley, of whoman estimated 22,000 live in the city of Jericho, the largest population centerin the area.[9]Since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, it has established 40 settlements(including settlement “outposts”) in the Jordan Valley, inviolation of the prohibition in international humanitarian law against anoccupying power transferring its civilians into occupied territory.[10]About 9,500 Israeli settlers live in these settlements.[11] Themajority of the land used by the settlements is cultivated with date palms,field crops, and produce grown in greenhouses.[12]Israeli military orders designating areas near the Jordanianborder as closed military zones have effectively prohibited Palestinian accessto the Jordan River since 1967.[13] Israelalso controls the water aquifer beneath the arid valley and has grantedextraction rights over the valley’s aquifer to the national Israeli watercarrier, Mekorot.[14] Israel prohibits new Palestinian waterextraction in the Jordan Valley under the terms of the Interim(“Oslo”) Agreement, and Palestinians there depend substantially onwater allocated by Mekorot.[15] ThePalestinian Authority pays the government of Israel for the water; Israeldeducts payments from tariff revenues that it collects on imports to andexports from the Palestinian Authority areas of the West Bank. Settlers in theJordan Valley receive an average of 300 liters of water per capita per day,while Palestinian access varies dramatically, from almost 200 liters per dayfor residents of Jericho to as little as 20 liters for residents of pastoralBedouin communities.[16]Overall, the World Bank reports, “water withdrawals per capita forPalestinians in the West Bank are about one quarter of those available toIsraelis,” and declined by 35 percent from 1999 to 2007, while actualdomestic use of water is about 50 liters per capita per day – lower thanthe daily minimum of 100 liters recommended by the World Health Organization.[17]According to the World Bank, agriculture contributed over 14percent of Palestinian West Bank GDP in the mid-1990s, but fell to only 5.1percent in 2011; meanwhile, even as employment in the Palestinian agriculturesector nearly doubled from 1995 to 2011, “productivity, or output perworker, declined by half” in that period, due to restrictions imposed byIsrael.[18] TheBank projected in 2013 that Israeli restrictions on irrigating agriculturalland “notionally available” to Palestinians in the West Bank– excluding some 187 square kilometers of land taken over by settlements– and on the export of crops by Palestinians cost the Palestinian economyUS $704 million per year.[19]The amount of agricultural land cultivated by Israeli settlementsin the West Bank grew by 35 percent from 1997 to 2012, according to KeremNavot, an Israeli group critical of settlement land use.[20] TheWorld Bank conservatively estimated in 2013 that “the potentialagricultural value of the settlements’ land used for agriculture is atleast USD 251 million.”[21]Area CIsraeli policies in the West Bank are based substantially onits limited delegation of authority over parts of the occupied territory to thePalestinian Authority (PA) under the terms of the 1995 Israeli-PalestinianInterim Agreement (the final “Oslo Accord”).[22]The majority of the 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank today live in“Area A” – cities and towns comprising about 18 percent ofthe West Bank, over which the PA has authority over both civil and securityaffairs – and in “Area B” – villages and rural landscomprising 22 percent of the West Bank, where the PA has civil but not securitypowers. Israel retained exclusive control over all security and civil issues suchas land use and building permits in about 62 percent of the West Bank, whichthe Oslo Accord designated as “Area C.”[23]About 300,000 settlers as well as 300,000 Palestinians live in Area C.The 40 Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley are locatedin areas designated as Area C. Although the 9,500 settlers in the Jordan Valleymake up about 11 percent of the region’s population, Israeli authoritieshave zoned and allocated 86 percent of the entire Jordan Valley (1,467 squarekilometers) to the control of two settlement “regional councils”:the Jordan Valley Regional Council and the Megilot Regional Council in thenorthern Dead Sea region.[24]About 87 percent of the land in the Jordan Valley isclassified as Area C.[25] Anestimated 18,000 Palestinians live in 68 communities located in parts of thevalley that are designated as Area C.[26]Israel designated an additional 7 percent of the Jordan Valley as“national parks” in 2002, rendering it unavailable for Palestinianagricultural or other use, in areas that had been classified as Area B. Israeliforces destroyed 172 Palestinian structures in the Jordan Valley in 2012, and390 in 2013, on the basis that they were built without the required permits.[27]In one Jordan Valley village, Jiftlik, Palestinian municipal officials showedHuman Rights Watch records they kept of 23 home-demolitions by Israeli forcesfrom January 2013 to February 2014, in addition to confiscations of propertyincluding cars.[28]Israel requires Palestinians living in Area C to obtainIsraeli military permits in order to use the land in any way, such as forbuilding or renovating homes, animal shelters, roads, walls, wells, watercisterns, electricity pylons, or solar panels; laying irrigation hoses;planting trees; ploughing land; or grazing livestock. From 2000 to 2007, themilitary denied more than 94 percent of Palestinian permit applicationsthroughout the West Bank; it has frequently demolished “illegal”construction, and fined Palestinians for illegal use of lands, such as byconfiscating sheep and requiring a fine per head of livestock for their return.[29]Land-Use RestrictionsThe Israeli military restricts Palestinian land use in AreaC on the basis of multiple, overlapping land designations, such as “stateland,” “military firing zones,” and “naturereserves.” These land-use restrictions effectively limit Palestinianbuilding to about 0.5 percent of Area C (approximately 1.8 square kilometers),much of which is already built up, according to Israeli planning experts andrights groups.[30]Israel designates much of the land within Area C as“state land,” i.e., land where Israel does not recognize anyindividual or collective Palestinian property rights.[31]Israeli authorities registered areas of the West Bank as “stateland” if the Jordanian authorities had registered them as state landbefore 1967, or if Palestinians could not prove individual ownership accordingto onerous requirements; in documented cases, Israeli authorities acceptedmilitary aerial photographs showing that plots of land were uncultivated at acertain point in time as evidence that no Palestinian had a legal claim to it.[32]Even in cases where Palestinians could meet Israeli requirements proving landownership, some lost appeals against Israeli seizures and transfers of theirland on the basis that they could not prove that Israeli officials who made thedeclarations did so in “bad faith,” as required by Israeli militaryorders.[33]According to Israeli military responses toinformation-disclosure requests by Israeli rights groups, since 1967 theIsraeli military Civil Administration division allocated 0.7 percent of allWest Bank “state land” (8.6 square kilometers) to Palestinians; 8percent (103 square kilometers) to Israeli settlement councils and mobile phonecompanies; 12 percent (160 square kilometers) to Israeli government ministriesand national telephone, electric, and water utility companies; and 31 percent(400 square kilometers) to the World Zionist Organization (WZO), whichestablishes settlements.[34]Israel’s official policy is to establish settlementsonly on state land, where it considers that Palestinians do not have legitimateprivate ownership claims. However, according to official Israeli recordscompiled by an Israeli civil society organization that opposes the settlements,about 21 percent of the built-up area of settlements is located on privatelyowned Palestinian land.[35]Restrictions on Palestinian AgricultureIsraeli prohibitions on Palestinian land use in the JordanValley are based on multiple legal designations that Israel imposes on land,such as “state land,” in addition to declaring its exclusivecontrol of Area C. As well, the military has assigned almost half of the landin the Jordan Valley to “military firing zones,” and designatedabout a fifth of the land as “nature reserves.” These designationsfrequently overlap: for instance, Israel has designated some areas in theJordan Valley as not only falling within the jurisdiction of a settlementregional council, but also as state land, as a military firing zone, and as anature reserve.[36]Israel does not enforce the land-use restrictions it imposeson Palestinians on Israeli settlers. In the Jordan Valley, for example, severalagricultural settlements are permitted to cultivate lands that are locatedwithin designated military firing zones, which are off-limits for land use ofany kind by Palestinians.[37]Israel has reallocated West Bank land and water resourcesfrom Palestinians to settlers, provided additional subsidies to settlers, andimposed additional restrictions on Palestinians’ ability to cultivatetheir remaining lands, access water, and build infrastructure such asagricultural roads, greenhouses and irrigation systems.[38]A Palestinian community leader from the village of Sbeidat, aPalestinian village of 1,800 people in the Jordan Valley, told Human RightsWatch in May 2014 that residents were then cultivating only a total of 100hectares of land, much less than in the past: “Before 1967, we cultivated[300 hectares], but Argaman [a settlement] took over [150 hectares], and welost two water wells.”[39] APalestinian middleman who supplied agricultural workers to a settler in Tomersaid that the settler was cultivating land “taken from Majdal, close toAqraba.”[40]The M. family, one of its members told Human Rights Watch, came originally fromTammoun, near Nablus, but moved to Jiftlik in the Jordan Valley when they weredisplaced by fighting in 1967. At first, they farmed land there until it wastaken over by Beka’ot, an agricultural settlement. Fourteen members of theextended family had worked in Kalia, a settlement in the southern West Bank,until they were fired without cause in 2010, family members said. They wereunable to find work with Palestinian farmers, whose own immediate families domost of the work on their farms. The M. family owns no agricultural land, theytold us, and when they rented land to cultivate for one season they achieved aprofit of no more than 1000 shekels ($370).[41]In the Jordan Valley, Israel’s State Comptrollerreported that the Israeli military confiscated thousands of dunams of land (onedunam is a tenth of a hectare) from Palestinian owners whom Israel determinedwere “absentees,” because they had fled or been expelled from theWest Bank in 1967. Military orders required the military to safeguard this“absentee property” pending the return of the owners but, inpractice, the military has transferred “absentee” land tosettlements.[42]According to a survey of official Israeli land-use data conducted by an Israeliexpert on the West Bank settlements:In order to give the agricultural areas allocated to thesettlements in the Jordan Valley their [contiguous] bloc-like character, theIsraeli authorities sometimes coerced Palestinian landowners into signingland-swap […] contracts—i.e., to receive lands that Israel haddefined as “absentee property” in exchange for their original land,which the state then transferred to the settlers. During the [1990s], when someof the landowners, who had fled the Jordan Valley in the aftermath of the 1967War, returned and demanded their lands back, those who had signed the […]contracts were left with nothing. […] At least eight differentsettlements obtained part of their land through such contracts.[43]Palestinian municipal officials in Jiftlik, a Jordan Valley communitywith 5,000 residents, told Human Rights Watch that Israeli authorities hadconfiscated 85 hectares of agricultural land from village residents who left in1967 and allocated it to the agricultural settlements of Masua andBeqa’ot.[44]A Palestinian humanitarian NGO reported in 2013 thatPalestinian farmers typically earn 50 to 100 shekels ($14.30 to $28.60) per dayafter expenses, which, in some cases, include the cost of renting land fromsettlements. The land lease usually consists of “an oral agreementbetween the Palestinian and the Israeli settler […] with profits split50-50 with the settler.”[45]As settlement agriculture has grown, Palestinian agriculturehas declined. Agricultural lands under Palestinian cultivation in the West Bankdecreased by 30 percent from 1965, two years before Israel occupied the area,to 1994.[46] Duringthat time, Israel enforced military orders that regulated Palestinianagriculture in minute detail, and restricted Palestinian access to markets foragricultural products.[47] From 1994 to 2008, revenues from agriculturedropped from 13.3 percent to 5.7 percent of Palestinian GDP.[48]In addition, Israelirestrictions on Palestinians’ freedom of movement and the transportationof crops harm Palestinian farmers’ ability to export any crops to Israelor further abroad. Israeli checkpoints restrict four of the five roads into theJordan Valley; three of these checkpoints do not allow Palestinians to cross intheir own vehicles unless they previously obtained a permit to enter the JordanValley, while the fourth generally allows Palestinians to cross only on foot orin buses.[49]Palestinians in the Jordan Valley, including farmersseeking to transport their produce to markets in Palestinian towns and citiesoutside the Jordan Valley, often have to take the longer, fifth road; theseadditional transportation costs, in addition to added costs of delays atcheckpoints, cost farmers an additional 8.4 million shekels ($2.3 million)annually, according to UN estimates.[50]Israel often requiressecurity inspections of Palestinian produce at checkpoints, which involvesoffloading produce from one truck, examining it, and re-loading it onto asecond truck.[51]Such procedures increase shipping times and costs,and break the “cold chain” of continuous refrigeration thatimporting countries often require for fresh fruits, vegetables, and meatproducts.[52]By contrast, Israeli settlement produce is typicallyinspected on-site, shipped to exporters located inside Israel without unloadingand inspection at checkpoints, and then exported abroad.[53]Israel also obliges Palestinians to export allproduce through Israeli exporters, whereas settlement produce is inspected insettlement packing houses and shipped directly to Israel for consumption on theIsraeli market or export.According to a Palestinian trade union representative,Palestinian farmers in the Jordan Valley exported dates and vegetables toJordan and other Arab countries until 1988, when Jordan relinquishedterritorial claims to the West Bank. “Now they only sell inside the WestBank, and sometimes vegetables to Israel,” he said.[54]A community leader in Sbeidat told Human Rights Watch that nearly everyone inthe village was employed in settlements or in local agriculture, but that localfarmers could not earn much money because “the Israelis undersell us,they flood the market, or they stop us at checkpoints and ruin the crops.It’s only local markets for us, no exports, not even to Israel, becauseit’s too difficult to get the permits.”[55]Palestinian residents of the Jordan Valley said that Israelicontrols over their access to water limited the ability of Palestinians toengage in profitable agricultural activity. Overall, more than 70 percent ofPalestinian communities in Area C are not connected to any water network.[56]In Fasayil, a community of 1,500 people, about 60 percent of the workforceworks in settlements, while the other 40 percent raise sheep, a municipalofficial said.We don’t get enough water. We need to dig a new well,but that is not allowed. We have a two-inch-diameter water pipe, but wedon’t control when it is on, the [Israelis] do. After the settlementscame, our well, the Fasayil well, dried up; it was near the settlement ofMa’ale Ephraim. From April through November, we get less water becausethe settlements use more of it.[57]A community leader described a history of similar problemsin the village of Sbeidat:Ten years ago here, our wells dried up, because thesettlements were using so much water. We went to Mekorot [the Israeli nationalwater carrier] and asked for water, but they only offered to give us saltywater. People would go with their tractors and water tankers and steal waterfrom the settlement pipes. This was from 1994 to 2001. The Israelis werearresting people, there were police around all the time because of water theft.In 2001 Mekorot started to give us 7 cubic meters per hour. They put arestricting valve in the pipe, and every once in a while people would break thepipe and remove the valve, to increase the flow. Today, we get 17 cubic metersper hour, every other day. We get water for 24 hours, then the two othervillages nearby [Marj al-Ghazal and Marj al-Naaje] get it for 12 hours each.[58]Palestinian children and adults who work in agriculturalsettlements told Human Rights Watch that they did so because they had few otheremployment opportunities.[59] A 2014World Bank study found poverty rates from 28.2 to 33.45 percent in the JordanValley.[60]Unemployment in the West Bank stood at 19 percent in 2012.[61]Unemployment in Israel (and the settlements) in 2013 was 6.9 percent.[62]Settlement Agriculture in the Jordan ValleyIsraeli agriculturalsettlements were established in the Jordan Valley on land confiscated fromPalestinians by the Israeli military, and allocated to settlements without costor at nominal cost.[63]Israeli settler-farmers also receive 70 percent of their water from the Israelinational water carrier, Mekorot, which extracts water from the aquifer lyingbeneath the Jordan Valley; the other 30 percent come from the Jordan River anda ground-water reservoir.[64]As of August 2012, about4,240 Palestinians held official Israeli permits to work in the settlementagriculture sector, mostly in the Jordan Valley, according to the Israelimilitary’s Civil Administration.[65] Israel does notcollect figures on the number of Palestinians working in settlements who do nothave official permits, including children.[66] Israeli andPalestinian rights and development groups, and representatives of a Palestinianlabor union, estimate that a total of around 10,000 Palestinian workers areemployed in agricultural settlements in the Jordan Valley during the summerdate-harvesting season.[67]The Israeli government doesnot publish disaggregated information about the total value of Israelisettlement agriculture or exports of settlement agricultural products toforeign markets. According to a 2013 report in Der Spiegel, in total,“Each year, the settlers export some €220 million ($299 million)worth of goods to Europe [including settlement produce], whereas the comparablefigure for the Palestinians is a mere €15 million ($20 million).”[68]As noted, the World Bank conservatively estimates the value of settlementagricultural production at $251 million.[69] According to theJordan Valley Regional Council, “the value of agricultural production inthe Jordan Valley is about 500 million shekels [$146 million] and thecultivated area is about 33,000 dunam [33 square kilometers].”[70]Crops cultivated insettlements include 14 square kilometers of dates, of which more than 80percent are exported; 4.6 square kilometers of table grapes, with 70 percentexported; 3.1 square kilometers of bell peppers; and 3 square kilometers ofherbs and spices, which “comprise 40 percent of Israel's yearly export,”the website states.SubsidiesIsrael provides numeroussubsidies to settlement agriculture, for which Palestinians are ineligible. Thefull amount of Israeli settlement incentives is difficult to identify fromstate budgets, although some settlement subsidies are explicit.[71] In2009, for example, the government allocated 20 million shekels ($5.7 million)to the settlement division of the World Zionist Organization (WZO) to developsettlement agriculture, particularly in the Jordan Valley.[72] In2012, the Israeli parliament’s finance committee approved 7.6 millionshekels ($2.17 million) for the “Jordan Valley” and the“Binyamin” settlement regional councils.[73]Overall, the amount of land that Israel allocated for agricultural use toJordan Valley settlements increased by 16 percent from 1997 to 2012.[74]Agricultural settlements thatthe Israeli government designates as “National Priority Areas” areeligible for a variety of benefits.[75]Most designated National Priority Areas inside Israel proper are communitiesthat receive a low ranking on Israel’s official“socio-economic” scale (from 1 for the poorest and mostdisadvantaged to 10 for the most affluent), but periodic government decisionson which communities are priority areas have included many settlements regardlessof their relatively high socio-economic rankings.[76]The Ministry of Agricultureand Rural Development supports settlements designated as National Priorityareas on the basis of the Law for the Encouragement of Investments inAgriculture of 1980.[77]Under the law, the ministryprovides tax-exempt grants for the establishment of an agricultural farm orfactory, including the allocation of the land, in the sum of 20 percent of thetotal costs, to communities that the government designates as national“Priority Area A,” including settlements (Article 24). The lawlimits the maximum total tax rates for individual and businesses that ownagricultural farms (Article 33).[78]The ministry provides an additional administrative grant,worth five percent of the total investment, for “settlements of the[Jordan] Valley and Judea and Samaria.”[79]Family-owned packing houses in agricultural settlements are eligible forMinistry of Agriculture subsidies, and non-family packing houses are newlyeligible for a 500,000 shekel ($142,850) grant under the ministry’sdevelopment plan for 2014.[80]In a May 2011 plan, which has not yet been enacted, the agriculture ministrystated it would increase the cultivated lands of settlements in the JordanValley by 130 per cent and increase each settler’s water allocation by 20per cent.[81]An Israeli agricultureministry “subsidies brochure” describes the procedure by whichsettler-farmers may apply to receive an “allocation of Palestinianworkers.”[82]Another agriculture ministry document describes the laws and regulationsapplicable to the “allocation [of water] to the Water Association of theJordan Valley.”[83]By comparison, studies andsurveys cited by al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank, indicate that thePalestinian Authority (PA) has spent little on agricultural development. A 2012report found that the PA had never allocated more than 1 percent of its annualbudget to its Ministry of Agriculture, while a 2007 study found that about 85percent of that ministry’s budget went to pay staff salaries.[84]II. PalestinianChildren Working in Israeli SettlementsAccording to the UN, about 24 percent of all Palestinianworkers in Area C, including the Jordan Valley, work in settlements, with themajority employed in agriculture.[85] About30 to 35 percent of Palestinian workers in settlements are women; another 15percent are under 18, and up to half of the children are aged 16 years oryounger, a trade unionist and a labor rights lawyer who work in the West Banktold Human Rights Watch in separate interviews, based on their experience.[86]The International Labor Organization expressed in 2009 its“great concern” at “child labor in Israeli settlements[…] particularly in agriculture,” and cited an Israeli estimatethat 1,900 children worked in Israeli settlements throughout the West Bank.[87]Staff at a Palestinian humanitarian NGO that conducts surveys on childrenworking in settlements, the Ma’an DevelopmentCenter,estimated in 2014 that there were up to 1,000 children working in settlementsin the agricultural sector, although the number would fluctuate throughout theyear and be highest during summer, when schools are closed.[88]In a 2004 survey on child labor, the Palestinian CentralBureau of Statistics found that from 3.8 to 6 percent of children aged 5 to 17in the West Bank were working, with the highest rate – 13.2 percent– in the Jericho governorate, in the Jordan Valley.[89]About 56 percent of the children who worked were under 15 years old; of them,almost 49 percent worked in agriculture. The survey did not disaggregatechildren who work in Israeli settlements, but some of its results appearapplicable to children who work in settlements: 71 percent of children work“due to economic need,” 51.4 percent to “assist householdprojects,” and 19.6 percent to “increase household income.”[90]Notwithstanding substantial Palestinian poverty rates in theJordan Valley, the settlement agricultural sector attracts some workers,including children, from elsewhere in the West Bank. Hashem Masarweh, a fieldworker with the Israeli workers’ rights group Kav LaOved, said he visiteda warehouse in the village of Al Ouja, north of Jericho, in August 2013 andfound 17 people from the village of al-Yamun, which is near Nablus, outside theJordan Valley, living there, including 5 children.The middleman drove up while I was there in a black Skodaand when I introduced myself, he told me, ‘Ask the kids if they have anybread in their house.’ Some of them said they had sick parents whocouldn’t work, or they just hated school. They said they were paid 60shekels per day, but the middleman deducted 10 shekels a night for them tosleep in the warehouse, and 5 shekels to drive them to the settlements.There’s more than one warehouse like that.[91]Human Rights Watch visited another warehouse in Al Ouja inFebruary 2014, where three men, aged 19 to 21, were living. The men said theyworked in the nearby settlement of Gilgal, and that four children, including a14-year-old boy, had lived with them at the warehouse until the previous month.There were still seven mattresses on the warehouse floor.[92]At another warehouse in Al Ouja in April, Human Rights Watchfound three men, aged 20 to 21, who said they had dropped out of school in theGrades 7 and 8, and one boy, aged 17. The men were from al-Yamun, and the boywas from Nasiriyah, another village near Nablus. The four said they worked inthe Na’ame settlement from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. six days per week for 70shekels per day.[93] Theyworked in Na’ame from December to April or May, and worked inside Israelduring the rest of the year.Palestinian MiddlemenSettler employers do not contract directly with Palestinianagricultural workers, but work through Palestinian middlemen, who areresponsible for hiring, transporting, and paying workers. Each middleman– whom workers refer to in Arabic as a wasit, or in Hebrew as a kablon,or contractor – is typically paid around 75 to 100 shekels ($28.50) perday by the employer, and in addition, deducts fees of around 15 to 25 shekels($4.25 to $7.14) from the daily wages of each worker for whom he or she isresponsible, in part to cover transportation and other expenses.[94]Some middlemen pay compensation to workers who were injured or became sick onthe job, but others do not, according to Palestinian workers.F., 13, said he worked in Petzael onweekends, earning 50 shekels a day after his middleman deducted a fee, or morewhen he worked overtime, sometimes starting at 5 a.m. and working until 3 p.m.[95]He told Human Rights Watch: “The contractor came to myhouse and asked me if I wanted to work. Work is better than school, my familyneeds me to work. There are six in my family, three boys and one girl and myparents. I’m the oldest boy, and me and my father work. My family wantsme to finish school and also to work on weekends, and I do too.”Human Rights Watch interviewed H., a middleman, who said hesupplied 50 workers to a settler in Tomer year-round, “and at the time ofthe grape season, it goes up to 70 workers.” H. described his job:In total there are 500 Palestinians working at Tomer andabout 50 or 60 Thais. I work with one settler, which is normal. Under me are afew foremen, and I give each foreman 20 workers to supervise. The settler givesme money to pay for things, and I give him receipts, but he doesn’t buttin. He will go on vacation and just leave it all to me. We get orders thatI’m responsible for. The settler will say, “We’ve got to fill10 boxes [with produce] for Mehadrin or Galil,” and I have to make surethey’re filled. If we need to buy pesticide or something, then I go getit, from stores around here. We export to the US, France, Russia, and SaudiArabia, or we sell to Israel and the Palestinian market.[96]In addition to these work duties, middlemen serve anotherpurpose for their employers: avoiding the need to obtain work permits for andprovide pay slips to Palestinian employees, who could use such paperwork asevidence in court. Wael Natheef, a Palestinian labor union representative, toldHuman Rights Watch: “In agricultural production the worker rarely has apermit. The middleman, who is usually a worker ‘promoted’ from theworkforce, will just have a list with his work crew on it. If workers are firedthey have no proof of having been employed.”[97]H. and O., another middleman, said they were responsible for paying workers incash; all of the workers Human Rights Watch spoke to said they were paid incash without any documentation.H. said that some of the older workers who had worked underhim for 10 years or more had official Israeli work permits, “so theycould go to court,” H. said, but the younger workers did not.“There are no pay slips, and there is no evidence,” he said.Palestinian middlemen who employ children to work forIsraeli settler-employers also evade Israeli laws that prohibit children under 15from working, and that prohibit children from working during school hours.While Palestinians who work in settlement industrial zones or in theconstruction sector inside settlements must obtain security clearances from theIsraeli military to enter the settlements, those who work in agriculturalfields can go to work without such permits. According to Z., 19, who has workedin settlements since he dropped out of school in Grade 10, “if you workfor a settlement, they check your huwwiya [identification document], butif you work for a farmer, they don’t care.”[98]S., who was 16 at the time she spoke to Human Rights Watch,said she left school at age 13 because her family needed her to earn money. Sheworked in Kalia, a settlement, until age 15, when she was fired, along withother members of her family who worked in the settlement. S. did not knowwhether Israeli labor inspectors ever visited her settlement, but said she hidwhen on her way to work because of her age. “I would hide under the seatsin the [middleman’s] bus on the way [to Kalia] whenever we saw a soldieror security guards, because [the middleman said] I was too young towork,” she said. “Sometimes the soldiers stopped the bus and I toldthem I forgot my identification card at home. They always let methrough.”[99] (Israelallows the Palestinian Authority to issue identification documents only toPalestinians aged 16 and above).In some cases, middlemen “employ” their ownchildren. L., 15, said he dropped out of school when he was 13, in Grade 9, towork in Tomer, where he picked and packed asparagus. “My dad isresponsible for me, and for 4 or 5 other people. He has 2 wives and there are14 people in the family, and me and 3 of my brothers left school to work.”L. said he earned 85 shekels per day – above average – for asix-hour shift beginning at 5:30 a.m. and up to 130 shekels if he worked until4 p.m. The work required him to bend down low to the ground, which gave himback pains, he said. “I used to spray pesticide but I got a bad allergyin my eyes and had to get eye drops at the pharmacy, so now my dad won’tlet me use pesticide.”[100]Exploitative andDangerous Work ConditionsAges and Hours of WorkMost of the Palestinian children whom Human Rights Watchinterviewed said they began working on Israeli agricultural settlements at age13 or 14. Children as young as 11 work part-time, and one boy interviewed byHuman Rights Watch reported he had worked alongside a boy of only 10.[101] Two brothers told Human Rights Watch thatthey began working fulltime when they were 13 and 14 years old. Now ages 16 and17, they said that of the 40 people who worked with their contractor, 15 wereyounger than they were, with the youngest a boy aged 14.[102]A 16-year old girl, who had left school at age 13 to work, told Human RightsWatch that the majority of the 100 workers employed at the settlement where sheworked were under age 17.[103]I., from Sbeidat, began working during holidays and afterschool when he was 11 years old, and quit school to work full time when he was13, he said.[104]One 15-year old boy, M., said he dropped out of school at age 14 to beginworking in the settlements of Tomer and Petzael. Of the 20 Palestinians workingwith him, he said five were under age 18, with the youngest aged 14.[105]Eight of M.’s 30 classmates had left school to work in settlements.“I work because my father died and my mother doesn’t work,”he said. “I’m the oldest of seven children and the sole provider.This is the only the way to make money.”M., 16, said that three of his eight co-workers were also 16years old, and another four were 14 or 15. The boys worked under differentmiddlemen, but they all worked from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a half-hour break.[106]They earned 60 shekels per work day, after the middlemen’s deductions,and worked about 15 days per month, because frequently there was no work forthem in the settlement, M. said.In 2011, Human Rights Watch interviewed three 13-year-oldboys, two from Jiftlik and one from Fasayil, who said they worked on weekendsand after school. R., 13, a Grade 8 student, said his eldest brother, who is17, took care of him and his two sisters and three other brothers because theirfather was in jail and their mother was in Jordan. To help, R. worked with hisgrandmother picking onions in Tomer from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m., and sometimes to 3p.m., on Fridays and Saturdays.[107]“I take the onions out of the ground and pile them up in one spot,”he said. “I cut them, either with scissors or a knife. They spray the onions,not while I’m working on them, but they’re still wet from thepesticide.”A.’s mother explained that she received permissionfrom the middleman to have A. help her. “I took him to help me finish abigger area,” she said. “If you finish up to 150 square meters ofpicking onions, that’s considered a day’s work. I’m allowedto bring help, so that I can finish more, you get two days’ pay if youfinish 300 meters.”[108]Children said they often work six or seven days a week,beginning at 5:30 or 6 a.m., and finish at 1 or 2 p.m. During peak harvestperiods, they may work eleven or twelve hours a day. When interviewed in 2011,I. was 14, and working six days a week, “sometimes from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.when it is very busy.”[109] One17-year-old boy said, “In dates, we work extra hours, until 4 or 5 p.m.,three to four weeks a year for pruning, and during the picking season, we haveto fill up three trucks before we can go home, so sometimes we have to workvery late.”[110]Children are sometimes pressured to work without breaks.Fifteen-year old I. A., who dropped out of school after Grade 8, said,If you sit down while you’re workingwith peppers or grapes the supervisor will come and tell you to stand up andnot take a break. We don’t get bathrooms – we get permission fromthe supervisor to go out in the fields. They are always yelling at us, notinsulting us but saying, “Work faster, you’re too slow.”There’s no respect for me there. The middleman will fire people in themorning, without giving them their pay for the day, like if they damage thefruit for example. You can’t switch middlemen, they would talk to eachother and force you to go back to the first one you tried to quit on.[111]F., age 13, cut peppers and put them into boxes, sometimesworking from 5 a.m. until 3 p.m. He said, “They don’t want me to gountil I finish. I have to do 10 rows of peppers a day. I wanted to leave onetime but the supervisor told me, ‘No, you have to stay until you finish10 rows.’”[112]M., who said he would have liked to have become a teacher,said that 7 boys from his elementary school class of 17 students had droppedout to work in settlements before completing Grade 10. Three of his eightco-workers were 16 years old, and four were 14 or 15, he said. The boys workedunder different middlemen, and said they worked ten hours a day -- from 6 a.m.to 4 p.m. -- with only a half-hour break.Low WagesThe average daily wage for Palestinians in the West Bank,not including workers in settlements, was 87 shekels ($23.50) in 2012, thelatest date for which figures are available; in the governorate of Jericho,which is located in the Jordan Valley, the average daily wage was 80.8 shekels($21.80).[113] InIsrael and the settlements, the average monthly wage was 8,971 shekels ($2,425)per month, or around 407 shekels ($110) per working day, in 2012.[114]Israeli law provides for a minimum wage, which isperiodically updated; by law, the minimum wage for children under 18 years oldis lower than the adult minimum wage. Israeli military orders extend theminimum wage law – but not, as Israeli legal scholars point out, crucialaspects of its enforcement mechanisms – to cover Palestinians working inWest Bank settlements.[115]As of October 1, 2012 – the most recent increase at the time the researchfor this report was conducted – the adult daily minimum wage was 198.46shekels for a worker employed 5 days per week, and 172 shekels for a workeremployed 6 days per week, or 4,300 shekels per month and 23.12 shekels perhour.[116]For children under 16, the minimum monthly wage was 3,010 shekels, or around 16shekels per hour; for 16 year olds, the minimum monthly wage was 3,225 shekels,or around 17 shekels per hour; for 17 year olds, it was 3,569 shekels, or around18.5 shekels per hour.[117]Israel’s minimum wage increased on April 1, 2015, to 25 shekels per hour,with children’s minimum wages set at between 70 and 83 percent of theadult minimum wage.[118]The average hourly wage for the 38 Palestinian childrenworking in agricultural settlements in the Jordan Valley whom Human RightsWatch interviewed was around 10 shekels ($2.70), or 70 shekels ($19) per day, afigure consistent with reports of earnings of such child workers byhumanitarian and development groups.[119] Some children tookhome 50 shekels per day – an average of 6.25 shekels ($1.65) per hour– after paying for transportation to and from settlements; another groupof 10 workers, including 3 children, earned 65 shekels ($17.50) for an 8 hourwork day, or about 8 shekels ($2.20) per hour.[120] Mostchildren said they earned 10 shekels per hour in “overtime” if theyworked longer than 8 hours, usually during the date pruning and pickingseasons. At some settlements, settlers gave employees a 5-shekel-per-day raisefor each year they worked, but other settlers did not, workers said.[121]S. told Human Rights Watch that she received 68 shekels eachday for a shift that ran from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., and that she usually worked 7days a week, but sometimes was not required to work on Saturdays. “Wecarried buckets of tomatoes that weighed about nine kilograms, and there wereno bathrooms,” she said. Workers were paid by the month, without payslips, and they were not paid for days when they failed to work because theywere ill.The Israeli 1958 WageProtection Law compels employers to pay monthly salaried employees by theend of the month, and to pay hourly or weekly workers every two weeks.Employers who delay paymentfor one week must pay the worker his wages plus a penalty of 5 percent and forevery week of delay thereafter a penalty of 10 percent.[122]Israel does not appear to have applied this law to Palestinian employees ofsettlers.[123]Some Palestinian children working in settlements said theywere paid late, or not at all. Two 17-year-old brothers from the Aqabat Jaberrefugee camp, near Jericho, quit school when they were in Grade 9 and worked inPetzael, a settlement, for two years, along with other child workers. “Weleft Petzael because [the middleman] didn’t pay us for the last twomonths,” H. said. “We never got the money.”[124]Although all of the Palestinian adults and children workingin agricultural settlements whom Human Rights Watch interviewed earned far lessthan the Israeli minimum wage, most labor disputes that Palestinian workers andmiddlemen described to Human Rights Watch involved severance pay rather thanthe minimum wage. Israel’s Minimum Wage Law states that workers cannotwaive their rights to minimum wages, but as one Palestinian middleman stated,“you can’t ask the [settler] for a raise, because they’d fireyou,” whereas workers demanding severance pay have less to lose, as theyhave already lost their jobs.[125]According to an ILO review ofIsraeli labor laws, Israel’s 1963 Severance Pay Law entitlesdischarged workers – though not workers who resign – to severancepay equivalent to one month of salary for each complete year worked, unless theworker is discharged for a serious disciplinary violation.[126]While some Palestinians sued for severance pay, others wereafraid to do so for fear of being blacklisted, according to some of those whospoke to Human Rights Watch. For example, H. said he knew of two Palestinianworkers from Fasayil who possessed official Israeli work permits who had suedtheir settler-employer in Tomer in early 2014 for the severance payment due tothem under Israeli law when their employer made them redundant. “They wonthe lawsuits but now they are on a blacklist and so are their children,”he said. “No one will hire them.” Another Palestinian worker saidhe avoided going to court to demand his full severance pay, and had made a“deal” with his employer instead, for fear that his children mightbe placed on a blacklist.[127] H.said that middlemen who worked with other settlers in Tomer had told him about“a new thing the [settlers] have come up with, where the settler has apaper that all the workers will have to sign, that says they waive their rightto severance pay.” H. criticized that reported initiative but noted,“They [settler employers] can fire us all whenever they want. They havean alternative – they can get workers from Tammoun, or elsewhere outsidethe valley.”In 2014, the International Labor Organization (ILO) reported“particular concern” at the situation of “Palestinian women,men and children [who] are engaged in seasonal agricultural work in Israelisettlements” in the Jordan Valley, and described “an apparentlycoordinated practice by Israeli settlement employers in the Jordan Valley ofblacklisting Palestinian workers who have lodged complaints of labor rightsviolations.”[128]O., a middleman in Jiftlik who previously worked for 11years as an agricultural laborer in settlements, said of settler employers andthe middlemen who work for them: “They pay in cash, no pay slips, andthere are no [work] permits, so there is no paper trail to demand severance payor anything else.”[129]Another Jiftlik resident said he knew of workers who would be unwilling to goto an Israeli labor court to resolve a dispute with their settler-employer.“When you go to court they have to show permits, they can’t go withjust their word. Plus they have to pay money and provide documents,” hesaid.[130]O. said he had a contract with his employer: “I have acontract with him in Hebrew, it says I’m responsible for making sure [theworkers] are paid out of the amount he gives me, and to ensure the work getsdone, but it does not specify a number of workers.” O. said he paid hisworkers 80 shekels per day, “but because they have to get a car to takethem to work, some of them take home only 50 shekels a day.”The 2014 ILO report cited “well documented practicesof Israeli employers [in settlements] circumventing legal obligations towardstheir workers,” including “ploys to disguise the employmentrelationship, to avoid issuing payslips or to conceal the actual number ofhours worked, in order to evade minimum wage and social securityobligations.”[131]Consistent with Human Rights Watch’s findings, Oxfamreported in 2012 that none of the Palestinian workers its staff interviewedthat year in the Jordan Valley “received the benefits that Israeliworkers are entitled to by law, including holidays, overtime pay,transportation costs, health insurance, sick pay, or payments from a providentfund.”[132]Health and SafetyChildren described performing work on Israeli settlementsthat put their health and safety at risk. They handle pesticides that causenausea, dizziness and skin rashes, and over the long-term, are associated withcancer, neurological problems, and infertility. They cut themselves with sharptools and work with heavy machinery that can cause more serious accidents. Theyclimb high ladders and work in extreme temperatures that can cause heat stroke.Many of the children Human Rights Watch interviewed said they were not providedaccess to medical care or compensated for their injuries, and were refused sickpay for work days lost to work-related illness or injury.Exposure to ChemicalsThe majority of Palestinian children whom Human Rights Watchinterviewed said they sprayed crops with chemicals, as often as twice per week.Some carried canisters on their backs, while others used hoses connected totanks. Only two of the 16 children interviewed who said they worked withchemicals said their middleman provided them with masks, eye protection, andgloves.[133] Manyothers whose tasks included crop spraying described suffering from symptomsthat included dizziness, nausea, eye irritations, and skin rashes.Pesticides widely used in agriculture include insecticides,herbicides, fungicides, fumigants, and plant growth indicators. Some pesticidesidentified in agricultural settlements in the Jordan Valley areorganophosphates, which are neurotoxins.[134] Theyvary in toxicity and enter the body primarily through the skin, although theycan also be ingested or inhaled. Although anyone who works on a non-organicfarm may be exposed to pesticides, pesticide handlers are at particular risk,particularly if they do not use protective equipment.[135]According to the International Labor Organization, long-termpesticide exposure at low levels has not been well-researched, but has been“associated with chronic health problems in children, such as cancer andreproductive health problems.”[136] A 2011ILO report on children and hazardous work cites a study of exposure topesticides of children under 15 years old, which found the odds of soft-tissuesarcomas to be increased by four times and the odds of developing leukaemia byalmost three times; and other studies “that show that youngpeople’s neurological development is affected by exposure to pesticides,”potentially causing “lowered intelligence and behavioural abnormalitieslater in life.”Most children interviewed by Human Rights Watch did not knowthe names of the chemicals or whether they were pesticides, herbicides, orfertilizers. According to O., a Palestinian middleman, different crops requiredifferent chemicals. “Grapes need Alzodef, for instance. Lots of guyshave peeling skin on their faces during grape season.”[137]Alzodef is a cyanamide pesticide. The European Union decided in 2008 to stopauthorizing the use of cyanamide in plant protection, due to health risks.[138]An adult who worked in settlements said he had sprayedThionex on crops (a trade name for endosulfan, an off-patent insecticide) andbelieved it was in common use in settlements.[139] TheUS Environmental Protection Agency stated in 2010 that it was phasing outendosulfan “because it can pose unacceptable health risks tofarmworkers.”[140]The ILO noted in 2011 that “a cross-sectional study among young workingboys chronically exposed to the insecticide endosulfan” found the boys “experiencedcomplications in sexual development, including improper testosterone productionand delays in reaching sexual maturity when compared with a control group ofboys who were not exposed.”[141]M., 16, said he left school in Grade 6, when he was 14, towork. In the Tomer settlement, where he worked in greenhouses, M. said hesprayed chemicals on crops two full days per week from a container of around 30liters he carried on his back. “I have a lot of back pain,” hesaid.[142] Heexplained:There’s more than one kind of pesticide; one isstrong, another is weaker. I wear gloves, and when I use the strong pesticide Ialso get a paper mask. Decathlon is one of them. You mix 30 liters of water and100 centiliters of this. Basta is the other one. We mix the two of themtogether for better effect, with water.Decathlon is the trade name for an insecticide; Basta is thetrade name for an herbicide.[143]According to standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency, afterspraying with Decathlon in a greenhouse, workers should not enter the area fora period of 12 hours without special protective equipment.[144]Labels for Basta state: “When opening the container, preparing spray andusing the prepared spray, wear cotton overalls buttoned to the neck and wrist(or equivalent clothing) and a washable hat, elbow length PVC or nitrile glovesand face shield or goggles.”[145]M., an 18-year-old from a village near Jenin who dropped outof school in Grade 9 and was living in a warehouse in Al Ouja when Human RightsWatch interviewed him, said he normally wore a mask when spraying pesticidestwice a week. He sprayed once without a mask and required hospital treatment.“I got dizzy and couldn’t stand up,” he said. “Mystomach hurt and my eyes were red, so [the middleman] took me to the hospitalin Jericho. They kept me there for six hours before I went home. I don’tknow what was in the pesticide, [the middleman] prepared it.”[146]Two brothers, aged 16 and 17, from theAqabat Jaber refugee camp, said they worked in the Petzael settlement sevendays a week, from 5:30 a.m. to 12 noon, spraying sweet peppers with pesticidesand picking them, and digging trenches for irrigation pipes. Neither had accessto a protective mask or eye wear, they said. The 17-year-old said, “WhenI spray, sometimes I feel dizzy and don’t walk very well, but after 12hours I am OK again.”[147]Another pair of brothers, both aged 17 and also from theAqabat Jaber refugee camp, near Jericho, said they quit school in Grade 9 towork in Petzael.[148]They pick, clean and pack tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, herbs, and sometimesdates, and spray vegetables using gloves but not masks. “When we spraypeppers, we get rashes, but they go away after a week,” H. said.“If we get sick and can’t work, we are not paid that day.”M., a 14-year-old from Fasayil, said that other workerssometimes “spray pesticides on the peppers while I’m picking them.We get gloves to wear but not a mask.” He earned between 60 and 70shekels per day and said he gets “pains in my back from bending over topick the tomatoes and peppers.”[149]A Palestinian trade union representativetold Human Rights Watch that he knew of six Palestinian women and a girl whohad suffered eye problems while working in the Beit HaArava settlement in 2011after they picked cherry tomatoes that had been sprayed, without gloves, andhad then touched their eyes. He said his trade union had advised them to suethe settler-employer but they declined to do so for fear that this would resultin their dismissal, he said.[150]Two 17-year-olds and a 16-year-old boy from Sbeidat saidthey worked in Argaman, and sprayed vegetables with chemicals every other week,but did not know the names of the chemicals. They did not have protective gearand had rashes appear on their hands and faces, which took two or three days todisappear, whenever they sprayed, they said. They seldom sought treatment froma doctor, as this would cost more than a day’s wages.[151] Inthe three years that they had worked in Argaman, they had never been approachedby any labor inspector regarding their exposure to pesticides and had not seenany inspector at all, the three boys said, only security men from thesettlement.Three boys from Fasayil – two 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old– said they had “thrown up” after spraying pesticide fromcontainers they carried on their backs.[152] O.,16, who worked in the Tomer settlement on Fridays and Saturdays, said: “Ispray pesticide from a backpack. Our bosses [Palestinian middlemen] tell us tobe careful, but we don’t get masks, gloves, or other clothing. I have hadrashes on my hands, sore eyes, and I’ve thrown up after spraying it. Theboss tells us to go home until we get better.” Human Rights Watch couldnot determine whether the boys had vomited due to the effects of exertion orheat, or the toxicity of the chemicals, or other factors.An 18-year-old, M., who worked for a different employer inTomer, said he undertook spraying but was not equipped with protective gear andclothing. “The pesticide hurts our backs a lot, the packs are reallyheavy,” he complained.[153]M., 16, who said he left school at age 14 to work full-timein Tomer, worked five days a week picking sweet peppers, herbs, and othercrops, and twice a week spraying crops while carrying a 30-liter canister ofpesticide on his back, wearing only gloves and a paper mask for protection. Hesaid the canister was heavy and he had “a lot of back pains.” Hehad gone to the hospital twice “because of a rash on my skin.” M. didn’tknow the name of the pesticide he sprays, or the name of the settler on whoseland he works. He said the settler paid a Palestinian middleman to providePalestinian agricultural workers, who included two other 16-year-olds fromM.’s village and a 15-year-old from elsewhere.[154]Other children did not spray pesticides, but still describedill-effects from exposure. Fifteen-year old I., for example, said,“Sometimes they spray with pesticides while I’mworking; I use my shirt to cover my mouth and nose but I still feel itchy on myskin.”[155]Israel in 1992 adopted Labor Safety Regulations on workerswho handle pesticides, which it has not applied to Palestinian children workingin settlements, which prohibit children under 18 from working withphosphoric-organic pesticides.[156]High TemperaturesSeven Palestinian children told Human Rights Watch that theyworked inside settlement greenhouses where temperatures were stifling insummer.[157] M.,16, who said he left school at age 14 to work full-time in Tomer, where heearned 70 shekels for a seven-hour workday, appeared to have suffered heatstroke in a greenhouse.[158] Hesaid that he had fainted several times in May 2013 while working in agreenhouse, where he sprayed, picked and packed peppers. “Icouldn’t see, passed out, and the middleman took me home,” he said.“I took myself home when it happened the next day. On the third day, Itook myself home, then to the hospital in Jericho, where they gave me headachepills and said it was heatstroke.” M. said that he fainted at work onfive consecutive days and then was fired because of his fainting. He told HumanRights Watch:On the sixth day, I went to a new employer. I got shots fora month, at the hospital first and then they gave me the medicine to take to aclinic to get injections, to help with heatstroke. I would pass out for 2 or 3minutes. If it’s 40 Celsius outside, it’s 50 or worse inside thegreenhouse in summer, which is when most of the kids are working, becauseschool is out.In 2013, M. started fainting again in June, and receiveddaily injections for another month.Israel in 1995 adopted domestic regulations on youthemployment, which it has not applied to Palestinian children working insettlements, that prohibit children under age 18 from working in temperaturesbelow 4 degrees Celsius or above 40 degrees Celsius.[159]Handling Heavy LoadsSeveral of the children Human Rights Watch describedhandling heavy loads. Fifteen-year-old I. A., who dropped out of school afterthe Grade 8, said “I like grapes because the boxes areonly 5 kilos. But peppers are hard, the boxes can hold up to 20 kilos orso.”[160]F., 13, said he worked in Petzael onweekends, sometimes starting at 5 a.m. and working until 3 p.m.[161]He told Human Rights Watch, “I cut peppers and put themin boxes, then we have to move them, they’re heavy, around three feetlong and half that wide. My arms and the side of my back hurt. At first Idragged the box of peppers but then the supervisor told me I had to carryit.”Several of the Palestinian child workers interviewed byHuman Rights Watch also spoke of the physical demands they faced when sprayingpesticides or herbicides.[162]Yusef, an 18-year-old, who said he had dropped out of school at 14 to work atthe Tomer settlement, said he suffered from persistent backache due to carryinga heavy spray container on his back.[163] Saleh, a 15-year-oldworker from Fasayil, said he had dropped out of school in Grade 7, and toldHuman Rights Watch,My shoulders are numb from carrying the backpack that Ispray the pesticides with – it’s a 15 liter tank. I spray for halfan hour each time, then I refill the tank. I need to do this 15 times beforeI’m done, on the days I’m spraying. I don’t do it every day– the older guys spray every day.[164]Israel in 1995 adopted domestic regulations on youthemployment, which it has not applied to Palestinian children working insettlements, that prohibit children under age 18 from doing jobs that requirelifting objects that weigh more than 12.5 kilograms for boys, and 8 kilogramsfor girls, for a maximum of 2 hours per day.[165]Work Injuries and Lackof CompensationIn interviews with Human Rights Watch, children oftendescribed cutting themselves, and some accidents that were more serious. Astatistical survey of work injuries among Palestinian children who work foundthat of all working children, 79.1 percent reported an occupational injury inthe last 12 months (81.7 percent of boys and 73 percent of girls), and that 33percent of children who worked in agricultural production reported back pain.[166]O., 16, who works in Tomer at weekends, said that he andother workers commonly sustained cuts from using vine clippers during the grapeseason: “We’ve all hurt our fingers like that. If it’s bad,you sit at home for four days and don’t get paid, you wait until you healso you can come back to work. If you get sick and have to go home in themorning, you’re not paid for the hours you worked that day.”[167]Before working in Beit HaArava two 17-year-old brothersworked for two years in Petzael, with other child workers. In Petzael, H.recalled,Anyone who got injured on the job would have to wait thereuntil the end of the day to leave with the van, either to go home or to thehospital in Jericho. One of the workers cut his finger off in an accident. Theytaped the finger back on and made him wait for the end of the day. Anothertime, a small tractor flipped over, and a boy was stuck until the Thai workersrescued him. If you were injured, you would not receive any salary for thehours you didn’t work.[168]Their work conditions at Beit HaArava were an improvementover Petzael, they said, because their current middleman would take workers whowere injured on the job to the hospital.A., 13, said he helped his mother pick onions in Niran, asettlement, on weekends. “Last summer I helped my father work in Massua[settlement], shoveling and moving fertilizers around,” he told HumanRights Watch. “That was better because I cut myself once working withonions. We use retractable razor blades. They just told me to keep onworking.”[169]I., from Sbeidat, said that he cut himself once and had tobe taken to the hospital in Jericho by his friends, but had to pay the costshimself. [170]M., a 15-year-old from Fasayil, dropped out of school inGrade 9, when he was 14, to work in the settlements of Tomer and Petzael.[171]In the date season, he said, he was required to climb a ladder to a height oftwo to three meters, or use a crane, to prune date palms and pick dates.“The date trees have a lot of spikes, and once I cut myself andcouldn’t work for a month,” he said. “I wasn’t paid anycompensation, because if you don’t work, you aren’t paid. If I goto the doctor, I pay for it myself.” M. said he works six days a week andreceives time off during Jewish, but not Muslim, holidays.Some Palestinians described other working conditions thatcould be dangerous to underage workers, particularly during long shifts. InFasayil, two boys, aged 15 and 16, who had both dropped out of school in Grade9, said they worked “in the factory building in Tomer” on a machine“that makes boxes for vegetables and dates out of cardboard,” from6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.[172] M.,18, said he was injured while working on one of the machines in April, 2014. “About10 days ago I was working on a machine that folds cardboard into boxes, andpart of it has really hot glue, like 150 Celsius, and it got on my finger andmelted my skin off.” The middleman he worked under took him to thehospital and paid him for the time he had already worked that day, Mohammedsaid.[173]A 19-year-old woman who worked in Tomer picking cherrytomatoes recalled an accident in 2011 when a 17-year-old boy “got hisfinger caught in the date-sorting machine, and both the middleman and thesettler said they were not responsible.”[174] Twoworkers, aged 17 and 18, said they knew people who had been injured when theyfell from ladders or platforms while pruning or picking from date palms, whichcan reach 15 meters in height.[175]Lack of Access toMedical Care and Lack of CompensationIsraeli labor laws applicable to settlers who employPalestinians require employers to pay for health insurance for their employees.[176]The employer should purchase insurance for health care costs arising frominjuries at work, and provide sick pay.[177] Noneof the children or other Palestinian workers whom Human Rights Watchinterviewed had access to Israeli health insurance. In some cases, children whohad been injured or fell ill on the job said that Palestinian middlemen hadpaid for their hospital care, and in one case, a middleman paid a boy dailywages for 25 days while he was recuperating from fractures to his hand causedby a work injury. In other cases, however, children had to pay for theirtransportation to Palestinian hospitals and their medical care.[178]Of the Palestinian adults and children Human Rights Watch interviewed, only oneknew of a case of an injured Palestinian worker receiving treatment in anIsraeli hospital. He said the worker in question, a man from Jiftlik who wasinjured and lost consciousness when he fell from a crane while picking dates inthe Massua settlement, received treatment at Israel’s Rambam hospital.[179]The Ma’an Development Center reported in 2013 thatwhile some 30 percent of workers it surveyed said that they had been injured onthe job, only two had received “any compensation or paid leave days fromtheir settler employers” or middlemen.[180]O., a middleman, said that the settler he worked with inTomer had asked him to accept responsibility if any of his 16 workers wasinjured on the job: “My boss last week wanted me to sign a paper sayingif anything bad happened to my workers, I was responsible. I refused.”[181]O. said he did not know whether the employer had purchased insurance to insurethe workers against work-related accidents. Israeli law obliges employers to doso.[182]A 17-year-old who worked in the Petzaelsettlement, for instance, said that one of his co-workers was bitten by a snake– “they come out around the plants after 10 o’clock, when itgets hot,” he said – and the middleman took him to the hospital.“The settler paid the cost to get him to the hospital, but refused to payfor the three days’ rest that was required.”[183]A 16-year-old boy who worked in Tomer said he was stung onhis hand by a scorpion in mid-2013. “I’m allergic to stings,”he said, “I went to the doctor, and had to pay 250 shekels for thehospital care and 80 shekels for the taxi.”[184]A 17-year-old boy who dropped out of school in Grade 8 also told Human RightsWatch that a scorpion had stung him when he was at work in the same settlement.“I felt it crawling up my back. It was beginning of the season [in 2013]when we were hooking up the water hoses in the field. My friends took me in anambulance to hospital. It [the scorpion] was a big black one, about 5 incheslong, so it was not so bad. The little yellow ones are bad: as soon as theybite, the grave.”[185] He wasnot paid for his time off work, he said.Impact on EducationThe high poverty levels of Palestinians in the JordanValley, exacerbated by Israeli policies that support settlements and restrictPalestinian land use – including for the construction of schools –and freedom of movement, result in many children dropping out of school andfinding work to augment their family incomes.[186]For many children, jobs in settlement agriculture are the only option. Otherchildren work in settlements part-time and still attend school, but said theywere often tired and unable to concentrate. This combination of factorsnegatively affects Palestinian children’s access to education andlearning experiences while in school.All the Palestinian children who worked in settlements toldHuman Rights Watch they did so to earn money for their families. A 15-year-oldboy, I., who dropped out of school after Grade 8, said he went to work because“my father had a car accident and I’m the only one who supports thefamily,” including his five siblings.[187] I.said he earned 65 shekels per seven hour work day – in Israel, the hourlyminimum wage is more than 23 shekels – and worked six or seven days aweek.The Palestinian educational system comprises PalestinianAuthority-run primary and secondary schools, with around 75 percent of the 1.18million students in Gaza and the West Bank; schools run by the United NationsRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), with about 20 percentof the students; and private schools.[188] Under Palestinian law, education iscompulsory and free for 10 years, from Grades 1 through 10, and free forsecondary school education in Grades 11 and 12.[189]Overall student enrollment in basic education – Grades1 through 10 – increased from 81 percent in 1994-95, when the PA wasestablished, to 98 percent in 2008-09, and students who continued from basic tosecondary education (Grades 11 and 12) increased from 65 percent to 91 percentin the same period.[190]From 1997 to 2011, school dropout rates in the West Bank for boys and girlsaged 12 to 14 decreased from 5.8 percent to 1.7 percent, and from 26 percent to20 percent for 15 to 17 year olds, according to the Palestinian statisticsbureau.[191]A 2004 survey, conducted by Birzeit University and UNICEF,found that 30 percent of working children were enrolled in school, whereas 70percent had dropped out, mostly 15- to 17-year-olds.[192]Official Palestinian statistics were unavailable for JordanValley schools, but statements from principals, teachers, youth counselors andchildren indicated that school enrollment and dropout rates may be worse therethan elsewhere in the West Bank.The Palestinian authorities have not adequately enforced thecompulsory education requirement in communities in the Jordan Valley,apparently due in part to lack of funding for educational services and lawenforcement. According to school teachers, principals, and youth leaders interviewedby Human Rights Watch, many male students in the Jordan Valley drop out ofschool before or during Grade 10, and others fail to complete secondary school,in order to work in settlements. Of the 30 children whom Human Rights Watchinterviewed who were then working full-time in agricultural settlements, 18 haddropped out of school in Grade 10orearlier; the other 12 dropped out of secondary school in Grade 11 or 12. Fiveother children interviewed by Human Rights Watch still attended school butworked part-time in settlements, usually on weekends. Human Rights Watchinterviewed another 10 men and 2 women aged 18 or older who worked insettlements, of whom 8 said they had dropped out of school in Grade 10 orearlier.The principal of a secondary school in the Jordan Valleyvillage of Sbeidat, whom Human Rights Watch interviewed in 2011, said thatduring each school year, an average of around eight boys dropped out of school,starting at around age 14, or Grade 8.[193] According to theschool’s annual reporting, about 60 percent of students completed Grade12, he said, and “almost all of them are working in thesettlements.”[194]Of the students who complete Grade 12, about 50 to 60 percent pass thestandardized university entrance exam, called the tawjihi, the principalsaid. “Those who go to university mostly attend the [tuition-free, AlQuds] Open University, since otherwise […] they would have problemsfinishing their studies because they cannot afford to pay tuition.”The number of school dropouts in Sbeidat has apparentlyincreased since 2011. In separate interviews in 2014, a teacher and a guidancecounselor at the secondary school in Sbeidat said that staff at the school,which then had 134 students, conduct “counts” three times peracademic year to identify children who have dropped out: when school beginsafter summer vacation, and during the Fall and Spring semesters. From September2013 to May 2014, five boys had dropped out of grade 10, three from grade 11,and two from grade 12, to work in settlements; another two children dropped outof school for other reasons, but “we were able to get those two childrento come back,” the guidance counsellor said.[195] Thestudents who leave tend to have received low grades and also to come from poorfamilies, the teacher said.[196]Due to the economic situation of the families, the majorityof children, in grade 7 and up, work after school. They leave school at 2 p.m.,and some work until 7 p.m. Some go to help their families with their familygardens. If they didn't, their father would need to hire someone, and so bydoing things like picking okra, they help save money and keep it in the family.Others go to settlements like Argaman to work after school.The school principal said that he knew of children who hadbegun working in settlements after school or on weekends, accompanying anotherfamily member, when they were only 10 years old, who later dropped out ofschool.[197]He described one case from 2010:A 13-year-old boy dropped out to work in Argaman [anagricultural settlement]. I talked to his mother, father, and brothers to gethim back in school. He left school to work because his father is old and heneeds to earn money for the family to survive. He is now 16 and still works inArgaman.School staff work with families of children who drop out totry to get the child back to school, but with limited success, the Sbeidatschool principal said. Children who drop out tend to come from poorer familieswhere the parents or older siblings have not completed secondary school, hesaid.All the children Human Rights Watch interviewed who haddropped out of school said they did so to help earn money for their families.M., 15, said he dropped out of school in Fasayil in the Grade 5, “becausethere are 10 people in my family and only me and my dad work.” He said heearned 70 shekels per day in Petzael, but spent 20 shekels on the taxi to andfrom work.[198]I., 14, from Sbeidat, said that he worked full time inArgaman -- picking, planting, packing and spraying herbs, while wearing glovesand a paper face mask -- to help pay his older brother’s universitytuition.[199]F., 17, and I., 17, from Sbeidat, said they had dropped outof school when in Grade 7, when they were 13; of 15 boys in their class, only 8had finished elementary school.[200]F. and I. were working in Argaman, a settlement, along with M., 16, who haddropped out of school when he was 14.[201] F., the oldest ofseven siblings, said that his family depended on his earnings and those of hisfather, a shepherd. About half of the 15 people who worked with F. were under18. I., also the eldest of four siblings, said he was his family’s onlysource of income, because his father was too old to work. Two of I.’sco-workers were 17 years old, while the other two were 15, he said.M, the oldest of five siblings, said that he was also theonly breadwinner in his family; his mother had passed away and his father wastoo old to work. M., who said he would have liked to have become a teacher,said that 7 boys from his elementary school class of 17 students had droppedout to work in settlements before completing Grade 10.Palestinian educators and activists said children wereinfluenced by other children who earned a daily wage in agriculturalsettlements and lured by Palestinian middlemen or contractors, many of whom had“graduated” from working as laborers in settlements. The Sbeidatschool principal observed, “After 20 years of working in the school, Idon’t have much money, but a typical contractor can buy a car and a houseafter working for 5 years.”[202]Some students Human Rights Watch interviewed also pointed out that that theirolder siblings had obtained university degrees but nonetheless ended up lookingfor work as laborers in the settlement agricultural sector. In Jiftlik, one Grade10 student said that her brother finished nursing school but was picking grapeson a settlement. Another tenth-grader said, “my brother finished a degreein engineering at al-Najah University, now he’s looking for work in asettlement.”[203] A16-year-old from Fasayil who worked in Tomer settlement said, “My cousinis an engineer but he can’t find work, so I don’t really care aboutschool anymore.”[204]M., 18, said that he quit school in Grade 10 because, as he explained,“so what if you get an education, you’ll wind up working for thesettlements.”[205]M. said he worked from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. for 75 shekels per day, and was theonly member of his family of eight to work.A Palestinian non-profit organization, the Ma’anDevelopment Center, reported in 2013 that students in Jordan Valley communitiesin Area C, where the Israeli military controls land use and denies a majorityof construction permit applications, face additional disincentives to attendschool:Students in Area C who do not have a school in their communitymust commute to schools located in Area B. [Since] 2011 […] a majority ofthese 22 communities now have buses to transport students to school.Unfortunately, due to budget constraints from the [Palestinian Authority], thebuses only have the capacity to transport around 50 percent of [these]school-age children […]. Buses will make up to seven trips to eachcommunity [daily]. Long transportation times, delays at checkpoints, and ashortage of buses make students late for school, while others have no choicebut to walk. Others stop attending school entirely.[206]Fasayil, another Jordan Valley village, has a primary schoolthat teaches children from Grades 1 through 10. S. N., 31, the head of theyouth sports club in Fasayil, said there were 42 children in the Grade 1 class,but only 10 children in Grade 9; the rest had dropped out. “In the Grade11 class now we have only seven girls and one boy. Contractors come andconvince them to leave.”[207]N. said that 14-year-old boys were most at risk of dropping out of school towork in settlements.Some children went to school during the week and worked insettlements on weekends, which they said was tiring. M., a 14-year-old, toldHuman Rights Watch that he had been working 5 a.m. to 1 p.m. shifts on Fridaysand Saturdays in the settlement of Petzael since he was 12. “I go toschool during the week,” he said. “It’s tiring to work allweekend. You take a break in school, it’s time to relax.” M. saidhe wanted to finish secondary school, “but it might not be possible”because he needed to earn money for his family. His father was unemployed, andhe and his 18-year-old brother, who quit school in Grade 4, were supportingtheir parents and nine siblings, M. said.[208]The largest community in the Jordan Valley, apart fromJericho, is the village of Jiftlik.[209]The Palestinian Authority-run secondary school there has 120 students,including 77 girls, in Grades 10 through 12. Of the 25 children in Grade 12,around 13 girls and 5 boys pass the final “tawjihi” exam, aprerequisite to enroll in university, an administrative staff member said.[210]A teacher at the secondary school told Human Rights Watch:At the end of each semester, the elementary school sends usa list of 75 to 80 children who are going to come from Grade 9 there and enrollin Grade 10 with us, but only 50 ever turn up. We always ask where they go, andit’s usually to work in settlements. After a month or two has passed ineach semester, as well, there’s usually another 2 to 5 kids who leaveschool to go to work in settlements, usually the ones who aren’t great atschool decide to leave. We follow up and try to get them to go to vocationaltraining. But you’ll find lots of people with higher degrees who still goto work in settlements.[211]The school administrator, who said he had formerly workedfor a decade in an agricultural settlement in the area, said that relativelyfew children from Jiftlik worked in settlements after school and on weekendscompared to those in Sbeidat, and that those who did were not performing wellacademically. “It’s very obvious which kids go to work insettlements, because they are exhausted in class, and some of them proudlyexplain why they are getting low grades,” earning money at work, he said.[212]III.Israel’sFailure to Protect PalestinianChildren from Child LaborThe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Israeland Palestine have ratified, obliges states to implement compulsory and freebasic education, to “recognise the right of the child to be protectedfrom economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to behazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful tothe child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or socialdevelopment”; and to “provide for appropriate penalties and othersanctions... in order to protect children from economic exploitation and fromperforming any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with thechild’s education.”Israel and Palestine have also ratified the InternationalCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which requiresstates parties to protect children from “economicand social exploitation,” to make children’s “employment inwork harmful to their morals or health or dangerous to life or likely to hampertheir normal development” punishable by law, and to “set age limitsbelow which the paid employment of child labor should be prohibited andpunishable by law.”[213]Israel is a state party toInternational Labor Organization (ILO) conventionsintended to protect children at work, jointly drafted by governments,employers’ associations and trade unions.The ILO General-Secretary’s annual reports on the situation of workers inIsraeli-occupied territory apply these conventions to assess Israel’sresponsibility toward Palestinian workers in the West Bank, including children.The ILO Convention on the Minimum Age for Employment (C138), ratified byIsrael, and all EU member states, requires states to set the minimum age ofwork at 15 years or older, and prohibits workuntil “the age of completion of compulsory schooling,” which is 10years of schooling in both Israel and Palestine.[214] It also bans hazardous work for children under18.[215] Lightwork is allowed for 13- to 15 year-olds only if it is not hazardous and does notinterfere with schooling.[216] Theconvention requires states to provide appropriate penalties to ensure itseffective enforcement, to define the “persons responsible” forensuring compliance, and to prescribe by law that employers must keep registerscontaining the names and ages of employees less than 18 years old.[217]Israel isobliged by other ILO conventions to ensure children receive medicalexaminations before being allowed to work.[218] Noneof the children Human Rights Watch spoke to received medical examinations.Israel is also a state party to the ILO Convention on theWorst Forms of Child Labor (182), which prohibits work including that which,“by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likelyto harm the health, safety or morals of children.”[219] TheILO’s accompanying recommendation for the convention says that indetermining work that is harmful or hazardous, states should give considerationto work at dangerous heights or in confined spaces; with dangerous machinery orthat involves the manual handling of heavy loads; work in work in an unhealthyenvironment, which may expose children to hazardous substances or agents or totemperatures damaging to their health; and work for long hours.[220]The ILO notes that long-term pesticide exposure at low levels has beenassociated with chronic health problems in children, such as cancer andreproductive health problems.[221]Israel’s international obligations to protect humanrights, including the rights of children at work, extend to Palestinians inoccupied territory.[222]Israel, however, disputes that its rights obligations extend to Palestinians inoccupied territory, and it refuses to report on their implementation to theexpert committees charged with monitoring Israel’s practice as a state partyto international human rights instruments including the ICESCR and the CRC. Forinstance, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its 2013 concludingobservations on Israel, regretted that Israel “has consistently failed toprovide information on the follow-up to the Committee’s recommendationsrelating to children living in the OPT,” including by failing to providedata with respect to all children living in the occupied Palestinian territory.[223]Israeli Labor LawsThis report describes Israel’s domestic laws onchildren and work because they reflect its international obligations, andbecause Israeli authorities have partly acknowledged a responsibility toenforce their protections for the benefit of Palestinians working insettlements, yet have consistently failed to do so. The report does not call onIsrael to extend its domestic legal order, including workers’ rightsprotections, into occupied territory. The international law of belligerentoccupation, applicable to the West Bank, prohibits Israel, as the occupyingpower, from extending the jurisdiction of its domestic labor laws intoPalestine as though it were the sovereign. Israel has unlawfully applieddomestic laws in occupied territory for the benefit of Israeli settlers, suchas laws on the establishment of companies.[224] Israelshould prevent abuses against Palestinians working in settlements, even thoughdoing so would not mitigate the unlawful nature of the settlements themselves,which depend on unlawful Israeli policies of transferring its civilianpopulation into occupied territory and appropriating land and other resourcesthere for civilian settlements.[225]Article 2 of Israel’s Protection of Youth Labor Law of1953 prohibits employment under age 15, although children who are still in schoolmay be employed as apprentices.[226]Children of age 14 may be employed during the summer vacation, but only if thework is undemanding and does not pose hazards to their health. The Israeli Youth Employment Law (Amendment No. 14)5770-2010, which came into effect on September 1, 2010, prohibits young personsin Grades 11 and 12 from work during school hours, unless they are employed asapprentices, and provides for fines of up to 43,800 shekels ($12,000) aspenalties for employers who violate this prohibition.[227]Pursuant to article 31 of the 1953 Youth Labor Law, Israelissued regulations requiring Israeli employersto keep a register with specific information about any children they employ. RegulationNo. 5718-1958 on Registry of Youth requires employers of juveniles to record, interalia, the child’s name, father’s name, date of birth, address,identity card number, employment card number, hours of work, annual vacation,and the date of starting the work.[228]Most of the children Human Rights Watch interviewed said they had never mettheir Israeli settler-employer, only the middleman, and he had never collectedthat information.Other provisions of the 1953 youth labor law entitlechildren of legal working age to 18 days’ annual leave from work, insteadof 14 days for adults, and restrict the work week to a maximum of 40 hours,instead of 43 for adults.[229]Palestinian children interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this reportdescribed work in settlements that varied with the season and crop, but 5 ofthe 38 children interviewed described regularly working for more than 50 hoursper week, and some described 7-day work weeks or 11- or 12-hour workdays duringbusy seasons.Israel in 1995 adopted regulations on prohibited andrestricted employment for children.[230]The regulations, as amended, prohibit work with certainchemical and biological substances, lifting objects that weigh more than 12.5kilograms, or exceed certain temperatures, and working with certain machines.[231]In addition, Israel informed the ILO that “the minimum age for admissionto hazardous work is 18,” and that it had adopted regulations inpursuance of Work Safety Ordinance No. 5370-1970 to that effect.[232]Israeli courts have ruled consistently that Israeli laborlaw protections extend to Palestinian workers in settlements. In a 1992 case, Al-Harinatv. Ruth Village, the National Labor Court ruled that an Israeli employercannot use a contractor for the purpose of bypassing or evading theemployer’s obligations under the law.[233]Ruling in 2007 on a case thathad lasted for 12 years, Israel’s Supreme Court held that Israelisettler-employers in the West Bank must comply with Israeli labor laws withrespect to Palestinian workers, and rejected the argument that Jordanian laborlaws, which do not protect minimum wage, severance pay and other rights,applied to Palestinian but not Israeli employees.[234](Palestinian labor laws, which the Palestinian Authority can enforce in limitedareas of the West Bank, not including settlements, generally afford greaterprotection than the Jordanian laws.) In 2010, according to a summary of thejudgment by Kav LaOved, the Israeli workers’ rights group, the JerusalemDistrict Labor Court held “that in the case of Israelis employingPalestinians through labor contractors, responsibility for the violation of theemployment terms lies with both the contractor and the employer.”[235]In 2013, the Jerusalem Regional Labor Court ruled that a settlement company wasrequired to pay compensation to workers for non-payment of minimum wages andother entitlements, on the basis that the 2007 ruling applied to allPalestinian workers in settlements.[236]Israel’s Labor Inspection (Organization) Law of 1953created an inspection service to help protect workers’ rights in Israel.[237]However, Israeli inspections of labor standards for Palestinian workers insettlements in the occupied Palestinian territory have been lax or nonexistent.The ILO reported in 2009 that although many of the estimated1,900 children working in settlements “perform dangerous work, forinstance on date plantations,” it was “unable to obtain anyspecific information” from the Israeli authorities “on anyinspections carried out in undertakings located in Israeli settlements.”[238]In 2010, the Israeli military’s Civil Administration division, which hasjurisdiction over the West Bank, confirmed that “today there is no listedmonitoring of minimum wage payments and social benefits regarding theemployment of Palestinians in the settlements.”[239]That year, the Israeli State Comptroller reported an “ongoing failureover many years to carry out meaningful supervision and enforcement in therealm of safety and hygiene in Israeli factories in Judea and Samaria, whichindicates an ongoing contempt for human life” – a failure thatimplicitly extends to agricultural workers, who often work on lands outsidesettlement gates and do not have the official security and work permits thatIsraeli authorities more commonly grant to Palestinians who work in factorieslocated inside settlements.[240] In2011, the comptroller criticized the Civil Administration and the Ministry ofIndustry, Trade and Labor for not regularly monitoring Palestinianworkers’ rights in settlements.[241]Israeli inspectors carried out no labor inspections intoconditions for Palestinians working in settlements in the Jordan Valley in2013, the most recent date for which information is available, the Israelidaily Haaretz reported.[242] Noneof the children Human Rights Watch interviewed had ever been spoken to by anIsraeli labor inspector.Israeli authorities claim that they have been stymied forbureaucratic reasons from protecting the rights of Palestinian workers insettlements. The Israeli military commander in the West Bank applies Jordanianlabor law that was in force there prior to the 1967 occupation, as well asmilitary orders that incorporate Israel’s minimum wage law, women’slabor law, and foreign workers law.[243] In2013, the Ministry ofEconomystated that the enforcement of other Israeli labor laws for the benefit ofPalestinians working in settlements would depend on therecommendations of an inter-ministerialcommittee including representatives of the military, and the ministries ofjustice and economy.[244]In May 2014, responding to questions from Haaretz,the Israeli military Civil Administration stated that under a military orderthat incorporated Israeli labor laws, enforcement of labor laws in the WestBank settlements is the responsibility of the same officials as in Israelproper.[245] TheMinistry of Economy acknowledged to Haaretz that it has the authority toenforce Israeli laws on minimum wage and foreign workers in the West Bank, andstated it was working with the Civil Administration and the justice ministry on“amending” military orders applicable in the West Bank. The ministrysaid:The goal is to apply [Israeli] labor laws ... to Israeliemployers in this area as well. The High Court of Justice’s ruling in theGivat Ze’ev case [2007] applied on the level of private international lawalone, giving workers the possibility to file a suit against an employer. Butthe government cannot acquire enforcement powers regarding laws that have notbeen applied to the area through military orders.The inter-ministerial committee had decided to implementIsrael’s Youth Labor Law in the West Bank – presumably by issuing amilitary order incorporating the law – according to a 2014 news reportciting a Ministry of Economy official.[246] However, Israel hasnot yet done so.The Jordan Valley Regional Council, the municipal authorityin the settlements, stated to Haaretz that it did “not have anydata” on labor rights violations by settlers.[247]Palestinian Labor LawProtections for ChildrenPalestinian laws and regulations provide protections forchildren at work, but suffer from under-enforcement in general, andparticularly in the case of children who work in settlements.[248]Palestinian labor inspectors cannot enter settlements, over which thePalestinian Authority has no jurisdiction.[249]Palestinian Labor Law No. 7 of 2000 (article 93) and PalestinianChild Law No. 7 of 2004, applicable to the West Bank, prohibit the employmentof any person under age 15; among numerous other requirements, children betweenages 15 and 18 must receive medical examinations every 6 months while working.[250]The Labor Law prohibits children under age 18 from beingemployed in industries identified by the Minister of Labor as dangerous orunhealthy (article 95), as well as from work on night shifts, overtime, piecework and employment away from their communities. In 2004, the Minister of Laborcreated a list of 32 activities prohibited for children ages 15 to 18,including producing and using pesticides and lifting more than 10 kilograms.[251]The Ministry’s decision allows the employment of children for a maximumof 6 hours of work per day, and requires employers to keep a record of birthcertificates and other information such as letters of consent from parentsallowing the children to work.In December 2012, the Palestinian Authority adoptedamendments to the Child Law that penalized child labor violations, includingfines up to approximately $2,800 for exposing children to dangerous workconditions. The law calls for the doubling of fines and closure of workfacilities upon repeated child labor violations.[252]Overall, the Palestinian authorities’ capacity toinspect labor conditions is “weak,” the ILO reported in 2014. TheGeneral Directorate of Labor Inspection, in the Ministry of Labor, employs“a mere 40 inspectors […] in the West Bank, where an estimated 300are needed.”[253]The Ministry of Labor employs 12 labor inspectors assigned to monitoring childlabor conditions.[254]The Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs is attempting to register allemployed youth, in an effort to improve the monitoring of working conditions,but employs only 13 child protection social workers in the West Bank.[255]The Palestinian government established a National Committee on Child Labor tocombat the problem of child labor. The Ministry of Social Affairs, working withUNICEF, also established “Child Protection Networks” in all 12governmental districts in the West Bank, through which it leadsawareness-raising campaigns on the damaging impact of child labor onchildren’s development and well-being, and the legal implications ofchild labor for adults involved.[256]Palestinian authorities have not adequately enforced theselaws in areas where they have jurisdiction in the West Bank (Areas“A” and “B” under the Oslo agreement, corresponding toPalestinian cities and towns). Between 2007 and 2011 the Palestinian laborministry referred only 10 people to the Attorney General for employing childrenunder age 15 in dangerous work. As the US Department of Labor reported,“Further information on any penalties imposed as a result of thesereferrals is not available.”[257]Under the terms of the Oslo agreement with Israel,Palestinian authorities do not have criminal enforcement powers in Area C,where settlements are located, as well as in many rural Palestinian communitiesin the Jordan Valley. At best, Pal­estinian police can arrest middlemensuspected of child trafficking if they are traveling through areas wherethe Palestin­ian Authority has jurisdiction. The Palestinian Ministry ofLabor’s Jericho office reportedly worked with Palestinian police toprosecute five child labor cases related to work on settlements from February2013 to early 2014.[258]IV. International LawObligations of Businesses and Third CountriesBusinesses have responsibilities to abolish child labor,including in their supply chains. Israel and its trade partners, including theUS and EU member states, are members of the Organization for EconomicCo-operation and Development (OECD).[259] TheOECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises stipulates that enterprisesshould “contribute to the effective abolition of child labor.”[260]The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rightsoblige businesses to “respect the standards of international humanitarianlaw,” and to “respect the human rights of individuals belonging tospecific groups or populations that require particular attention, where theymay have adverse human rights impacts on them,” including children. Theresponsibility to respect human rights requires businesses to:Avoidcausing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their ownactivities, and address such impacts when they occur.Seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impactsthat are directly linked to their operations, products or services by theirbusiness relationships, even if they have not contributed to thoseimpacts.[261]Israel’s trade partners that import settlementagricultural products, like the EU and the US, have incorporated human rightsobligations into their internal laws and regulations. Article 32 of the EUCharter of Fundamental Rights prohibits child labor and protects young peopleat work. It states that “The minimum age ofadmission to employment may not be lower than the minimum school-leavingage,” and that “Young people admitted to work must have workingconditions appropriate to their age and be protected against economicexploitation and any work likely to harm their safety, health or physical,mental, moral or social development or to interfere with theireducation.” Other European directives require member states to prohibityoung people from work involving harmful exposure to toxic agents, includingsome pesticides and herbicides; the risk of accidents that young persons cannotbe assumed to be able to avoid; and exposure to extreme heat or cold.[262]The EU has committed to seek to eradicate child laborglobally and supports a “ban on child labor.”[263]An EU report from 2010 noted that “child labor is both a cause and aconsequence of poverty, and it perpetuates impoverishment by compromisingchildren’s education. Working children delay entry into school, fail tocomplete a basic education or never attend school at all.”[264] A commentator notes that inorder to operationalize these rights in EU foreign policy, the EU could insert“social clauses” in trade instruments.[265] TheEU offers trade incentives, under the “General System ofPreferences” and “GSP +” trade regimes, to developingcountries that take steps to combat child labor, such as signing andimplementing relevant ILO conventions.[266] Theseincentives do not apply to Israel. The EU has not undertaken to restrict tradein products made with child labor, including products from Israeli agriculturalsettlements.The 1995 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which entered intoforce in 2000, states in a preambular paragraph that “the principle ofeconomic freedom and to the principles of the United Nations Charter,particularly the observance of human rights and democracy […] form thevery basis of the Association,” but contains no enforceable provisionsrelating to workers’ or children’s rights, human rights abuses, orviolations of international humanitarian law.[267]An EU-Israel agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products, whichexpanded the scope of the 1995 Agreement, entered into force in 2010; itcontains no reference to workers’ or children’s rights.[268]Israel claims tariff-free preferential treatment for exportsof settlement agricultural products to EU countries under the 1995 Agreement.The terms of the Agreement allow Israel to determine its territorial scope, andIsrael insists that it applies to settlements in occupied territory. In 2004,the EU and Israel agreed to a “Technical Arrangement” that requiredIsrael to supply the postal codes of the point of production of each product itexported to Europe, in order to distinguish products from Israel from productsfrom settlements, and deny preferential tariff treatment to the latter.[269]However, in shipments to the EU, Israeli exporters mix settlement products withproducts that originate inside Israel, and claim tariff-free treatment for theentire shipments.[270] TheEU’s policy places the burden of checking each item in the shipments onEuropean importers, rather than requiring Israeli exporters to distinguish suchproducts in the first place.[271]The United States Department of Labor, pursuant to theTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005, maintains andpublishes a list of consumer products from foreign countries that the Bureau ofInternational Labor Affairs “has reason to believe are produced by forcedlabor or child labor in violation of international standards.”[272]The US defines child labor under international standards as “all workperformed by a person below the age of 15” as well as “all workperformed by a person below the age of 18” in practices including“work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carriedout, is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals of children.”[273]There are currently 136 listed goods from 74 countries, atotal of 353 items.[274]Israeli settlement agricultural products have never been included on the list,although Israel was among the countries researched in 2008-2009, when the firstlist was published.[275] OtherUS labor department reports on the worst forms of child labor have focusedmainly on child labor in Palestinian-administered areas, but also repeatedlynoted that Palestinian “children traveling to and working in Israelisettlements may be subject to exploitation and harassment.”[276]The US should publicly list Israeli settlement agricultural products as amongthe goods produced with child labor. Further, the US should instructUS-domiciled companies not to import such products.The United States–Israel Free Trade Agreement, asrevised in 1996, treats products from the West Bank as products of Israel forthe purposes of the agreement.[277] In2004, the US and Israel liberalized trade in agricultural products, via anexchange of letters that did not exclude settlement agricultural products.[278]The US should revise the FTA to exclude settlement agricultural products on thebasis of international legal violations, including systemic abuses ofchildren’s rights.AcknowledgmentsThis report was researched and written by Bill Van Esveld,senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division.

TheBank’s estimate assumes that Israeli settlements are only as productiveas Palestinian farms, and hence is almost certainly an underestimate givensettler-farmers’ access to fertilizers and other inputs that Palestinianfarmers are denied.[22]As the occupying power in the entire West Bank, Israel is ultimatelyresponsibility for the welfare of the Palestinian population.[23]OCHA, “Area C Vulnerability Profile.” UN agencies had estimated thePalestinian population of Area C at 150,000, but revised the figure to 300,000in March 2014 after conducting an extensive survey.[24]OCHA, “Humanitarian Fact Sheet on the Jordan Valley,” p. 2l KeremNavot, Israeli Settler Agriculture, p. 50. This area includes thebuilt-up area of the settlements in the valley – including homes, publicand commercial buildings – which covers 6.66 square kilometers. Thesebuilt-up areas form the core of the “municipal area” of eachsettlement, which is often fenced, and which in some cases includesagricultural land and land reserves for future settlement expansion; the JordanValley settlements’ combined municipal areas cover 191 square kilometers.Under an Israeli military order, which has the force of law in the West Bank,areas located inside settlement municipal boundaries are “closed militaryzones” to which Palestinians are barred access unless they obtain specialpermits.

Israelreinterpreted and applied the law such that Palestinians lose ownership oflands unless they can prove they cultivated the lands continuously. Israelirights groups have documented cases in which authorities failed to notifyPalestinians of such decisions in a timely fashion, making it impossible forthem to challenge Israeli declarations that their property is state land.
