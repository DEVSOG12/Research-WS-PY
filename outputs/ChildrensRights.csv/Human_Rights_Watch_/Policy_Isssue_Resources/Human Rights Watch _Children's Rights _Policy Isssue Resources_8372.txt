Everyone is entitled to nine years ofcompulsory education, right?—Mother of Chen Yufei, Henan Province, January 2013.The mother of Chen Yufei tried hard to find a school for herson, a nine-year-old boy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)and an intellectual disability. When Chen was 7 she brought him to a nearbyschool, but the principal would not let him enroll because he would“affect other children.” Reluctant, Chen’s mother turned tospecial education schools, but she could not find one: the district in whichthey live did not have one. Eventually she got Chen accepted in a specialeducation school in another district — after two years and a hefty bribe.She still bitterly resents this experience, as she believes her son would makemuch better progress if he were in a mainstream school.Across China, children and young people with disabilities confrontdiscrimination in schools. This report documents how mainstream schools deny manysuch children admission, ask them to leave, or fail to provide appropriate classroomaccommodations to help them overcome barriers related to their disabilities. Whilechildren with mild disabilities are in mainstream schools where they continueto face challenges, children with more serious disabilities are excluded from themainstream education system, and a significant number of those interviewed byHuman Rights Watch receive no education at all.Internationally, there is a growing recognition that “inclusion”— making mainstream education accessible for children with disabilities —is a key element in realizing the right to education. The Convention on theRights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the most recent international humanrights treaty, mandates that state parties “ensure an inclusive educationsystem at all levels.”By ratifying the CRPD in 2008, the Chinese government made acommitment to “the goal of full inclusion.” Yet it has no clear andconsistent strategy to achieve that goal. It continues to devote too fewresources to the education of students with disabilities in mainstream schoolswhile at the same time actively developing a parallel system of segregatedspecial education schools. Inclusive education is not just a legalobligation, and it benefits not only students with disabilities — asystem that meets the diverse needs of all students benefits all learners andis a means to achieve high-quality education and more inclusivesociety. While an inclusive education system cannot be achieved overnight,the Chinese government’s current policies and practices raise questionsabout the extent of its commitment to do so.The Chinese government has taken important steps to promotethe rights of people with disabilities. Internationally, it was supportive ofthe development and adoption of the CRPD. Domestically, it passed the Law onthe Protection of Persons with Disabilities (LPDP), which outlines the rightsof people with disabilities as well as a number of regulations on disability. Ithas pledged greater funding for the education of people with disabilities andhas taken steps such as waiving miscellaneous school fees to facilitate theiraccess to education.[1]However, a closer look at education for people withdisabilities reveals a grimmer picture. According to official statistics, over40 percent of people with disabilities are illiterate and 15 million live onless than one dollar a day in the countryside. The Chinese government has animpressive record in providing primary education for children withoutdisabilities, achieving near-universal compulsory education for such children. Butaccording to official statistics, the rate for children with disabilities ismuch lower: about 28 percent of such children should be receiving compulsory basiceducation but are not.The Chinese government has often been considered a model inreaching the Millennium Development Goal regarding the provision of primaryeducation to all children — but the picture dramatically changes if thedata are disaggregated to focus on enrollment rates for children withdisabilities. Bars to enrollment, expulsion from schools, and lack of adequatesupport in mainstream schools, as well as lack of information about and troublereaching special education schools, are the main reasons for the enrollment gap.Discrimination againstchildren and young people with disabilities permeates all levels of educationin the mainstream system. Schools sometimes deny enrollment outright, but theyare often more subtle, convincing the parents to take their children out of theschools with a variety of arguments. Schools sometimes place conditions onparents, such as requiring that they accompany their children to and in school everyday, before they allow their children to study in the schools. While Chineselaws and regulations contain provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basisof disability, the provisions are often vague, fail to precisely definediscrimination, and do not outline effective redress mechanisms.The Chinese government also does not have a clear policy on“reasonable accommodation” in mainstream schools — defined inthe CRPD as “necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments notimposing a disproportionate or undue burden.” In interviews with HumanRights Watch, parents told of carrying their children up and down stairs toclassrooms or bathrooms located upstairs several times a day. Students withhearing impairments said they could not follow along because the teachers walkaround while teaching and do not to provide written notes, and there is no signlanguage instruction in most schools. They told us that students who are blindor who have limited vision are not provided with magnified printed materials ortests. Some mainstream schools exclude students with disabilities from theexamination system; they do not get graded and their progress is not otherwiseevaluated. In some rural areas, the government’s policy of consolidatingmainstream schools in recent years has had a negative effect on students withdisabilities, as schools to which they are assigned are further away and provideno transportation.While some teachers and principals in mainstream schoolsmake Herculean efforts to provide reasonable accommodation to students withdisabilities — out of the “goodness of their hearts,” as oneinterviewee put it — such support is not institutionalized. In bothpolicy and practice, the mainstream education system is set up in such a waythat the teacher’s focus is on students without disabilities; it is thechild with a disability who is expected to adapt to the system.Teachers find that the burden of supporting students withdisabilities rests entirely on their shoulders, as they are provided withlittle support to ensure reasonable accommodations in the classrooms. There isno staff support to assist the teachers, who often have to teach large classesof 30 to 60 students. Training for teachers and administrators in mainstream schoolsis limited and little funding goes to ensure that such schools are adequately resourcedto educate these students. There is also little incentive for teachers toprovide support to students with disabilities because doing so does not impacttheir performance ratings or prospects for promotion.As a result, many students with disabilities literally findthemselves sitting in classrooms without being able to follow the curriculum.This leads to failing performance and declining confidence, which only reinforcesthe effects of existing discrimination. China calls its scheme for students inthe mainstream education system “study along with the class”;because of the obstacles such children face, it has come to be jokinglyreferred to as “sit along with the class” or “muddle alongwith the class.” A large percentage of students with disabilities eventuallydrop out of school or move to special education schools. Once in the specialeducation system, there is little hope of their being able to cross back to themainstream school system. Families with children with disabilities should havea choice in selecting the most appropriate educational settings for theirchildren, but currently do not have a meaningful choice.In China, special education schools have fulfilled animportant function in providing access to education for children withdisabilities, and they are generally well-resourced with both teachers andequipment. However, special education schools separate children withdisabilities from those without, which in many cases is not what the childrenor their parents want. Special education schools are fewer in number andtypically farther away than mainstream schools and parents often know littleabout them, deterring parents from sending their children to them. And theyoften require the removal of children from their families and communities andplacement in a residential institution from a young age. Moreover, manystudents with severe disabilities are excluded even from special educationschools.Children with disabilities rarely stay in school beyond juniormiddle school, and for those who aspire to do so, choices are limited. TheChinese government maintains a system of physical examinations for secondaryschool students who wish to enter mainstream institutions of higher education.During this process, people with disabilities are required to declare theirdisabilities, and the results of the medical exams are sent directly to theuniversities. The government also has guidelines advising higher educationinstitutions to bar or restrict access to students with what they refer to as certainphysical and mental “defects.” In addition, students who are blindhave very limited access to mainstream universities, as the government fails toreadily provide Braille or electronic versions of the gaokao, the universityentrance exam.While there are vocational schools for people withdisabilities as well as higher education institutions in the special educationsystem, they tend to focus on training for skills and professions that aretraditionally reserved for people with disabilities. For example, the blind aretrained in massage therapy and the hearing impaired are trained in visual arts.Students with disabilities who aspire to other professions face dauntingchallenges. This includes the education profession itself: bureaus of educationtypically prohibit the hiring of teachers with certain disabilities.Parents play a pivotal role in determining whether a child withdisabilities is brought to school and whether the child can overcome thebarriers in the system. However, many parents interviewed by Human Rights Watchlacked essential information about their children’s educational rightsand options. While almost all of the children we interviewed had disabilitycards issued by the China Disabled Persons’ Federation (CDPF), aquasi-governmental disability body, the CDPF has not effectively reached out toparents about their children’s education, let alone helped them identifyand remove barriers in mainstream schools. The CDPF and the Ministry ofEducation, which oversees education, also fail to proactively addressdiscrimination and ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided inmainstream schools.Key RecommendationsHuman Rights Watch calls on the Chinese government to makean explicit commitment towards a truly inclusive education system by revisingexisting laws and regulations and by drawing up a clear strategic plan towardssuch a goal. The government should formulate a policy of reasonableaccommodation consistent with international law, set up a mechanism to monitorand provide effective redress in cases of discrimination, and develop outreachprograms to support parents so that they are informed of their children’srights and education options. Failure to ensure access to inclusive and qualityeducation is not only a violation of human rights, but also increases burden onfamilies and incurs economic, social, and welfare costs.More specifically, the Chinese government should:Revise the Regulations on the Education of Peoplewith Disabilities to bring them in line with the Convention on the Rights of Peoplewith Disabilities. Specifically, the new regulations should state clearly thatthe Chinese government’s overarching goal in the education of people withdisabilities is full inclusion at all levels of education and set forthspecific actions authorities should take to ensure reasonable accommodation ofstudents with disabilities in mainstream schools.Develop a time-bound, strategic plan to movetowards an inclusive education system that delivers quality education, withspecific indicators to measure access to education for children withdisabilities.Immediately repeal the Guidelines for thePhysical Examination of Students in Recruitment for Ordinary Higher LevelEducational Institutions because they allow disability-based discrimination inhigher education.Develop guidelines for the effectiveevaluation of students with disabilities studying in mainstream schools andensure that their educational progress is reflected in the performanceassessment of their teachers and schools.Provide financial and other resources,including adequately trained staff, to mainstream schools so that they canensure the provision of reasonable accommodation to pupils and students withdisabilities.Establish an independent body made up ofindependent disability experts and representatives of children withdisabilities and their parents to monitor the school system’s compliancewith relevant laws and regulations and to receive complaints aboutdiscrimination and lack of reasonable accommodation at mainstream schools. Thebody should be charged with making recommendations for reform.Detailed recommendations can be found at the end ofthis report.MethodologyThis report is based on 62 interviews conducted in 12provinces in China between December 2012 and May 2013. Forty-seven of thoseinterviews were with children[2]and young people with disabilities or their parents. Of the 47, 38 were underage 18 (“children,” as defined in international law) and 9 wereover age 18; 12 were out of school (6 had never been to school while six had droppedout) while 35 were in school (18 in mainstream schools and 17 in specialeducation schools). We interviewed 30 of the 47 in the presence of theirparents or grandparents. The rest of our 62 interviews were advocates for peoplewith disabilities, educators, government officials, and academics.All of the children and young people we interviewed were orshould have been in school after the Chinese government’s 2008 ratificationof the CRPD.Human Rights Watchinterviewed children and young people with a range of disabilities, includingphysical, sensory (hearing and visual), speech, intellectual, and mentaldisabilities. Some of the interviewees had multiple disabilities. Almost all ofthem had disability cards issued by ChinaDisabled Persons’ Federation (CDPF). These cards, which use the classifications prescribed in Chinese law,identify the holders as having the following disabilities: visual, hearing,speech, physical, intellectual, mental, multiple disabilities, and “other.”[3]Parents used these categories when describingtheir children’s disabilities, but some pointed out that the categorieswere inaccurate or did not capture the full range of their children’sdisabilities. Since Human Rights Watch was not in a position to identify theinterviewees’ disabilities, we have used the CDPF classifications in thisreport.In each interview, Human Rights Watch explained the purposeof the interview, how the interview materials would be used and distributed,and sought the participant’s permission before the discussions started.Interviewees were told that they could terminate the interviews any time theywished, or refuse to answer any questions. All the interviews were conducted inChinese but some required interpretation from the regional dialect or signlanguage into Mandarin. Human Rights Watch ensured that when interviewing thesechildren and young people, the way we asked the questions was appropriate fortheir age and sensitive to their disabilities. No interviewee receivedfinancial or other compensation in return for interviewing with us.We were also careful to protect all interviewees’identities and have replaced their real names with pseudonyms in the report.Because the Chinese government does not allow independentnongovernmental organizations to conduct human rights research in China, it wasdifficult for Human Rights Watch to obtain interviews with people in their officialcapacity. We were only able to interview a handful of government officials,academics, and educators and administrators in public schools. Despite theserestrictions, we believe the findings of this report are nationally representativeas our interviewees were drawn from 12 Chinese provinces and our analysis is basedon national laws and regulations.For the report, Human Rights Watch also consulted a numberof international disability experts. We also reviewed relevant English- andChinese-language domestic and international press reports, official documents, UNdocuments, NGO reports, and academic articles. Our findings are generallyconsistent with those set forth in these other sources.BackgroundDisability in ChinaAccording to official Chinese sources, an estimated 83million people in China — 6.3 percent of the population — have disabilities.[4]This is far below the global disability prevalence rate estimated by the WorldBank in 2011, which is 15 percent, and is likely an underestimate.[5]If the World Bank prevalence rate is used, the number is 200 million.As is often the case in other countries, people withdisabilities in China are the country’s “largest minority.”[6]In China, over 40 percent of people with disabilities are illiterate and 15million live under one dollar a day in the countryside, according to officialfigures.[7] Thelargest group is people with physical disabilities, with a population of 25million, followed by those with hearing, multiple, visual, mental, intellectual,and speech disabilities.[8] There iscurrently no data on those with autism.[9] Thegovernment reports that 75 percent of people with disabilities live in ruralareas.[10]The Chinese government has presented itself as a champion ofpeople with disabilities both domestically and internationally. It passed the LPDPin 1990 and issued administrative regulations including the Regulations on theEducation of People with Disabilities (REPD)[11] in1994; these protect the rights to education, employment, and accessibleenvironments for people with disabilities.[12]Internationally, the Chinese government has supported major events concerning peoplewith disabilities, notably including the first international NGO summit ondisability held in Beijing in 2000.[13]In 1988 the Chinese government established the ChinaDisabled Persons’ Federation (CDPF) under the leadership of Deng Pufang,who has paraplegia and is the son of the late Deng Xiaoping, China’spolitical leader in the 1980s.[14] Accordingto its constitution, the CDPF aims to “represent, serve and manage”[15]people with disabilities. Although the government often refers to the CDPF as anongovernmental organization, it acts under the direct supervision ofChina’s chief administrative authority, the State Council. It has anationwide network “reaching every part of China” and 80,000full-time workers, with its headquarters in Beijing.[16]It is responsible for a wide range of matters relating to people withdisabilities including education, employment, rehabilitation, culture, sports,advocacy, publications, and residential care.The CDPF is mandated to assistthe Ministry of Education in “the development and implementation ofeducation programs,” carrying out vocational training, and promoting andresearching the use of Braille and sign language.[17]At the local level, it conducts home visits,provides financial aid to students, subsidizes assistive devices, collects dataon people with disabilities, and operates rehabilitation centers for childrenwith disabilities.[18]Despite its laudable mandate, however, a numberof independent Chinese disability activists have accused the CDPF ofcorruption, misallocation of funds, hindering their work and threatening them,and failing to represent and fight for the rights of people with disabilities.[19]In addition to the CDPF,a number of international and domestic organizations provide services to peoplewith disabilities in China, and a handful of them focus on advocating for therights of people with disabilities. Most prominent among the latter are the BeijingYirenping Center and the Enable Disability Studies Institute.[20]The Chinese government tightly controls freedomof association in China and it is difficult for such organizations to legallyregister with the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Even if they are allowed tooperate, they are closely monitored, sometimes harassed, and at risk ofco-optation by the government.[21]Education of People with Disabilities in ChinaThere are four levels of education in China: pre-school,primary education (ages 6 to 12), secondary education (ages 13 to 18, whichincludes junior middle school, senior middle school, and vocational school),and higher education (ages 19 to 23). The Chinese government’s policy isto guarantee nine years of free compulsory education, including six years ofprimary and three years of secondary education. A child starts primary schoolwhen they are six years old, though in some areas children can begin schoolwhen they are seven.[22]The Ministry of Education oversees education at all levelsin China from pre-school to universities, as well as vocational trainingschools and special education schools. It is also responsible for draftinglegislation on education, developing curriculum and teaching materials, andtraining and certifying teachers. The allocation of education funding is unevenin China, particularly at the compulsory education level where localgovernments are responsible for providing adequate resources. This leads towide gaps between rural and urban areas and between rich coastal and poorinland regions.[23]The Chinese government currently operates two main systemsof education which people with disabilities may attend: mainstream schools andspecial education schools.[24] In thespecial education system, students are divided according to type of disability —there are schools for the blind, for the deaf, and for those with intellectualdisabilities; some special education schools can accommodate children withmultiple types of disabilities.Special education schools started in China in the 1950s soonafter the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, providingimportant access to education for people with disabilities when educationalopportunities were otherwise very limited. Schemes for the education ofstudents with disabilities in mainstream schools are called “study alongwith the class” or “learning in regular class” (LRC). Accordingto Ministry of Education statistics, there were 1,767 special education schoolsenrolling 398,700 children with disabilities in 2011; that same year mainstreamschools provided education to another 225,200 children with disabilities (includingvia special education classes in mainstream schools).[25]There are also some privately run special education schools or“rehabilitation institutions” that provide education to childrenwith disabilities.As noted above, CDPF statistics show that about 28 percentof children with disabilities in the compulsory education years do not go toschool, but this figure is not entirely reliable because official statisticsregarding disability and education from different government agencies are conflictingand inconsistent.[26]Considering that nearly all Chinese children in the general population go toschool at this stage, a 28 percent non-attendance rate is an astonishing gap.Among those children with disabilities who are out of school, 80 per cent arein rural areas.[27] In itspolicies and plans for education the Chinese government has outlined varioustargets to raise the enrollment rate for children with disabilities.[28]The vision is to raise the rate to match that of children without disabilities,and to raise the rate in rural areas to at least 90 percent enrollment by 2015.While official statistics show steady progress in raising the enrollment rateof children with disabilities since 2007, the government is unlikely to meetthese targets unless it addresses the problems documented in this report.The education of peoplewith disabilities has consequences far beyond childhood — it affectsemployment opportunities, quality of life, and the extent to which people withdisabilities will be able to support themselves and lead independent lives.[29]The failure to include people with disabilitiesin education and later in employment has important implications not only forthese individuals and their immediate families but also the wider society andthe economy. According to a 2006 study by the International Labor Organization,China loses as much as US$ 111.7 billion, or about 3 per cent of its GDP, as aresult of lost productivity stemming from excluding persons with disabilitiesfrom the workforce.[30]Chinese Government ObligationsThe Chinese government is party to the Convention on theRights of the Child (CRC), the International Convention on Economic, Social,and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the CRPD. The ICESCR and CRC guaranteeeveryone the right to education by making primary education compulsory andfree, secondary education available and accessible, and higher educationaccessible on the basis of capacity.[31] TheICESCR also obliges governments to ensure that the material conditions ofteaching staff will be continuously improved.[32] States arealso obliged to take measures to encourage regular attendance by children atschools and the reduction of child drop-out rates.[33]With respect to children, states are required to undertake such measures to themaximum extent of their available resources.[34]Specifically, children with disabilities should receive andhave effective access to education.[35] TheCRPD articulates in greater detail the right to education for people withdisabilities: they enjoy this right “without discrimination and on thebasis of equal opportunity,” they have a right to “an inclusiveeducation system at all levels,” and they have a right to learn skills sothat they can participate within their community fully and equally.[36]China’s Compulsory Education Law (CEL) stipulates that“all children” who have reached the age of six must go to school.[37]The LPDP explicitly guarantees the right to education for people withdisabilities.[38] TheLPDP stipulates that the government’s priorities are to ensure that studentswith disabilities have access to compulsory education and to develop vocationaltraining, noting that “efforts shall be made” to implementeducation at pre-school as well as higher education levels.[39]The Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities (REPD) spell outin greater detail how the education of people with disabilities is to be providedat all levels as well as how teachers of people with disabilities are to be certified,trained, and remunerated. In addition to these laws and regulations, the Ministryof Education also issues rules and normative documents on the education ofpeople with disabilities.[40]Finally, the State Council has issued long-term plans that give broad outlinesof the education of people with disabilities from pre-school to vocationaltraining and higher education levels and makes commitments to teacher trainingand subsidizing students with disabilities.[41]Non-discrimination and Equal AccessInternational law prohibits discrimination on the basis ofdisability, which is defined under the CRPD as any “distinction,exclusion or restriction…which has the purpose or effect of impairing ornullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis withothers, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.”[42]In terms of education, the CRPD requires that “people with disabilitiesare not excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability,and that children with disabilities are not excluded from free and compulsoryprimary education, or from secondary education, on the basis ofdisability.”[43] Thisobligation of non-discrimination applies both to public as well as privateactors, and at all levels of education, including higher education andvocational training.[44]The Chinese Constitution proclaims that all Chinese citizensare “equal before the law.”[45] TheLPDP also prohibits “discrimination on the basis of disability.”[46]These are statements of principle, however, and neither the Constitution northe LPDP define discrimination, outline consequences for discrimination, orprovide guidance on how to prove discrimination in court.[47]The proposed amendments to the REPD, released by theMinistry of Education in February 2013 for public comment, offer a smallimprovement in article 48, which spells out a number of consequences fordiscrimination, including “sanctions” by educational authoritiesand “apologies and compensation” to the offended party. Suchconsequences apply only in cases of “obvious discrimination,” butthere is no definition of discrimination or details about the kind ofdiscrimination that should be considered “obvious” in the proposedamendments.Inclusive EducationThe CRPD requires states to make education inclusive at alllevels.[48] The CRCalso stipulates that education of people with disabilities should be conduciveto the child’s social inclusion.[49] TheCommittee on the Rights of the Child, a body of independent experts that monitorstreaty implementation and issues general recommendations, has stated that“legislation which compulsorily segregates disabled children insegregated institutions for care, treatment or education”[50]is incompatible with the treaty.In an inclusive educationsystem, all students learn in the same schools in their communities regardlessof whether they are “disabled and non-disabled, girls and boys, childrenfrom majority and minority ethnic groups, refugees, children with healthproblems, working children, etc.”[51]It requires that the system make modifications tothe content and methods of education and provide support to meet the diverseneeds of all learners.[52]Inclusive education therefore is not onlyrelevant for the education of students with disabilities, but should benefitall children and be “central to the achievement of high-quality educationfor all learners and the development of more inclusive societies.”[53]Studies have shown that students withdisabilities achieve better academic results in an inclusive environment whengiven adequate support than they do in special education settings.[54]Inclusive education should be distinguished from two otherapproaches to educating people with disabilities. One is segregation, wherechildren with disabilities are placed in educational institutions that areseparate from the mainstream education system. Another is integration, wherechildren are placed in mainstream schools as long as they can fit in theseschools and meet their demands. Unlike inclusive education, integration tendsto regard the disabled child rather than the school as the one who needs tochange.[55]Inclusion focuses on identifying and removing the barriers to learning andchanging practices in schools to accommodate the diverse learning needs ofindividual students. In China, there is often confusion over the concepts of“integration” (ronghe) and “inclusion” (quanna)by academics and policy makers and the two terms are often usedinterchangeably.[56]The affirmation of the right to inclusive education is partof an international shift from a “medical model” of viewingdisability to a “social model.” A couple of decades ago, disabilitywas considered a defect that needed to be fixed. Disability today is viewed as aninteraction between individuals and their environment, and the emphasis is onidentifying and removing discriminatory attitudes and barriers in theenvironment.[57]While the CRPD advocates“the goal of full inclusion,” it also states that the primaryconsideration should be the “best interests of the child.”[58]In some circumstances, such as when an inclusiveeducation system is not yet functional or necessary accommodations cannot bereasonably provided, it may be more effective for the child to be educated inspecial education settings for part or all of the time. The CRPD emphasizes thevoice and choice of children with disabilities.[59]It is important that the government make effortsto ensure mainstream education is inclusive and accessible for children withdisabilities, and make special education available so that children withdisabilities have meaningful choices.As mentioned above, the Chinese government is currentlyoperating two main parallel systems of education for people with disabilities:special education and mainstream schools.[60] The twostreams exist in parallel and rarely interact. For example, the training ofteachers in these two systems is separate: teachers are either trained for thespecial education system or for the mainstream system. The goals for the twoeducation systems are different — while the mainstream system aims topropel students through the educational ladder and into universities, with astrong focus on succeeding in national academic exams, the special educationsystem mostly focuses on getting students through compulsory education andproviding vocational training.Although the two systems do overlap in some areas, the factsremain that they are separate and parallel and that there are systematicbarriers preventing students with disabilities from entering and staying in themainstream system. Children with disabilities are entitled to attend mainstreamschools only if they are “able to adapt themselves to study in ordinaryclasses”[61] and can“study along with the class.” This is in essence a form ofintegrated education — it is the students with disabilities who have toadapt to the education system, not the reverse.In its review of the Chinese government’s compliancewith the CRPD in September 2012, the Committee on the Rights of Persons withDisabilities expressed concern about the “high number of special schoolsand the State party’s policy of actively developing these schools”and recommended that the government “reallocate[s] resources from thespecial education system to promote … inclusive education in mainstreamschools.”[62] So far,the Chinese government has not taken concrete steps to meet thisrecommendation. The government’s 10-year education plan, issued in July2010, includes specific targets and clear timelines for building more specialeducation institutions but no comparable targets and timelines for theeducation of students with disabilities in mainstream schools. And whilefunding for special education schools has nearly quadrupled in the past decade,funding dedicated to mainstream schools specifically for the education ofstudents with disabilities has seen little growth; most local governments havenot dedicated funding to help mainstream schools implement “learning inregular class” (LRC) schemes.[63]The government’sproposed amendments to the REPD continue to call for the building of new specialeducation schools, including segregated institutions of higher education.[64]Under the amendments, a new panel of experts willbe established to place people with disabilities in either segregated schoolsor mainstream schools “according to the types of disabilities and theirlearning abilities”[65]and their “ability to receive an ordinaryeducation.”[66]In other words, the proposed mechanism continuesto segregate a category of persons with disabilities from the mainstream schoolsystem, and this decision is made by a group of experts without anyparticipation by families with children with disabilities in the process.Reasonable AccommodationTo realize the right to inclusive education, the CRPDrequires states to ensure “reasonable accommodation.” As defined bythe CRPD, reasonable accommodation means “necessary and appropriatemodification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undueburden…to ensure to people with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise onan equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.”[67] Ineducation, it more specifically means steps that “allow students to getan equal education by limiting as much as possible the effects of theirdisabilities on their performance,”[68]with the caveat that the steps not impose “significant difficulty orexpense” on the government.[69] Stateparties also have an obligation to ensure that the education of people withdisabilities, especially those who are deaf and blind, is provided “inthe most appropriate languages and modes and means of communication for theindividual.”[70] The CRPDalso requires that state parties promote the availability and use of assistivedevices.”[71]Examples of reasonable accommodation include holding classeson the ground floor; providing note-takers; allowing for additional time fornote-taking or during exams; priority seating for students to minimizedistractions and enable them to see and hear the teachers; providing assistivedevices such as magnifying equipment or tape recorders; providing sign-languageinstructors; reading aloud written materials for students with visualimpairments; and structural modifications to schools, such as ramps.[72]An important part of ensuring reasonable accommodation istraining teachers, school administrators, and education officials in methods tosupport persons with disabilities. Accordingto the CRPD, such training should include “disability awareness and theuse of appropriate augmentative and alternative modes, means and formats ofcommunication, educational techniques and materials to support persons withdisabilities.”[73] It iscrucial that teachers are given adequate support so that they can provideaccommodations to students with disabilities.Relevant Chinese regulations stipulate the establishment of“resource rooms” within mainstream schools and “resourcecenters” in a given area to provide guidance, equipment, and support tofacilitate education for children with disabilities in the mainstream educationsystem.[74] They alsostipulate that teacher training institutions include classes on specialeducation and that educational authorities include training in specialeducation at all levels of teachers’ training programs.[75]While the provision for resource rooms and resource centersis certainly a step in the right direction, any positive effect they might haveis hampered by the fact that Chinese laws and regulations do not clearlyrequire that schools provide students with disabilities “reasonableaccommodation” as defined in international law. The closest equivalent isin the LPDP requirement that the government provide “specialassistance” to people with disabilities so as to “alleviate oreliminate the impact of their disabilities and external barriers and ensuringthe realization of their rights.”[76]However, the choice of the phrase “special assistance” suggeststhat such assistance is out of the ordinary rather than a necessity and aright.Similarly, the REPD states that mainstream schools should provide“help to [meet] special learning and rehabilitation needs”; and theEducation Law and the CEL stipulate that schools should provide“assistance” and “convenience” — the vagueness ofthe terms again raises questions about whether the accommodations are rights towhich students are entitled or favors bestowed by the schools.[77] Another setof government regulations, Regulations on Construction of a Barrier-freeEnvironment, was enacted to “ensure equal participation of persons withdisabilities and other members of the community in social life,”[78]but the regulations only refer to general accessibility measures. The proposedamendments to the REPD mention “reasonable accommodations” twice,but provide no definition of the term or examples of the kind of supportschools are obligated to provide to students with disabilities.[79] None of thelaws, regulations, or the proposed REPD amendments outline any consequences ifthe government or the schools do not offer such support. They also do notrecognize denial of reasonable accommodation as a form of discrimination, asrequired under the CRPD.[80]More problematically, the limited “assistance”and “help” that schools must provide is conditioned on whetherchildren are “able to adapt themselves to study in ordinaryclasses,” as stipulated in the CEL and the REPD.[81] On the onehand, schools are supposed to provide assistance and flexibility to studentswith disabilities; on the other, students are supposed to show themselves ableto adapt to study in mainstream classes. In practice, the burden of proof is onthe students themselves — during enrollment, throughout the academic year,and as they advance in school — to show that they can adapt to existingschool requirements.Barriers to Educationfor People with DisabilitiesDiscrimination and Exclusion from Mainstream SchoolsAlthough the Chinese governmentis obligated by international law to ensure that all children have access tothe general education system regardless of disabilities, families told HumanRights Watch that children and young people with disabilities are deniedadmission by mainstream schools in their areas, pressured to leave the schools,or effectively expelled because of their disabilities. They also reported thatschools do not provide reasonable accommodation. Teachers are not given thenecessary support or training to work effectively with students withdisabilities; classrooms are physically inaccessible and lack appropriate materials;and student evaluation methods lack flexibility.Some children and young people with disabilities do overcomeall these barriers to education. Parents play a crucial role in this process,but generally lack awareness of their children’s educational rights andoptions. Many parents told Human Rights Watch, for example, that they wereunaware of the concept of “reasonable accommodations” or that thegovernment and schools are legally required to take measures that allowchildren with disabilities to study at mainstream schools. Instead, as notedabove, several told us that it is their children who are“defective” and need to adapt to the classrooms. A few parents withfinancial means told Human Rights Watch that they quit their jobs to accompanytheir children in school, moved to a different neighborhood with more acceptingschools, or started new private schools for their children and others whommainstream schools would not accept — just to improve the odds of theirchildren getting the education guaranteed to them by law.Most children whose parents are unable or unwilling toprovide support are denied the opportunity to be educated altogether. Among the47 families interviewed by Human Rights Watch, six children and young people withdisabilities never attended school and six dropped out from mainstream schoolsalong the way. Most of those who do not attend schools live in rural areas.Bars to AdmissionNine of the 36 families we interviewed who had tried toenroll their child in mainstream schools were denied admission by one or moreschools. One mother, Zhao Yibin, told Human Rights Watch that afterkindergarten no mainstream primary school would take her son, who has albinismand limited vision:We went to many schools, it was so hard. Nobody would takehim. We felt terrible as parents…. At the time, the class teacher agreedto take us, but the one in charge of student discipline wouldn’t. I thinkhe was afraid of the responsibilities.[82]The mother of Chen Yufei said the mainstream school in hervillage refused to enroll her nine-year-old boy because of his disabilities.The primary school near us wouldn’t enroll us. I wentseveral times but they wouldn’t let him in … I have been especiallyangry because of this…. This is because my child is different. Otherchildren in the village who are at a worse [academic] level are all enrolled.[83]In explaining theirreasons for not enrolling children with disabilities, schools cite a lack ofresources to care for them and fear of taking on extra tasks andresponsibilities, or simply say that the children “can’tlearn,”[84] are “different from normal children,”[85]or “might affect other children.”[86]Song Jianjun, the mother of a child with autism,told Human Rights Watch:[The school said] the conditions at the school aren’tadequate, that they do not have enough staff members to take care of thesekinds of children, that he can’t control his behavior.... I went to aboutthree schools, every one of them refused to take us, they all said theconditions in the schools don’t meet the standards.[87]Mother of seven-year-old Chen Yusheng, who has a physicaldisability, told Human Rights Watch:The people at the kindergarten didn’t want him, webrought him to the kindergartens in Guangzhou City, they all wouldn’tenroll him, they said they affect the other kids [in the school].[88]The reluctance of mainstream schools to admit children withdisabilities is also related to the highly competitive education system thatfocuses on test scores. In many parts of China, there is a “keyschool” system that rewards better-performing mainstream schools withmore resources and funding, and children with disabilities are often seen as aburden to these schools. A staff member at China Disabled Persons’Federation (CDPF) told Human Rights Watch:If you haveintellectual disabilities, [mainstream schools] ask you not to studyhere…. The schools want their ranking and are afraid that intellectually disabledstudents would encumber them so they often find opportunities to demand thatthese kids to go to special education schools.[89]Some mainstream schools require that parents to take care oftheir children at school as a pre-condition of admitting the children. A disabilityrights activist told us she met a couple of students who have severe mobilitydisabilities and were initially refused admission, but the parents pleaded tothe school. According to her:[T]he school said that unless a parent accompanied thechild, [they could not enroll the child] because the teacher has to prepare forclass. The teacher cannot accompany the child to the bathroom, or do much else …so the parents agreed and let the grandmother accompany the child, taking himto drink water and to the bathroom. If you can do this much, then the schoolsmay take you.[90]A few parents told Human Rights Watch that before children withdisabilities are admitted, they have to sign agreements with the school releasingthe school of responsibility should their children fall ill or be hurt.We have an agreement with the teacher, which we sign everyyear because our child is different from normal children. [We have to promisethat] if the child’s sick and so on, it has nothing to do with theschool. It’s a liability waiver.[91]In two out of the nine cases we investigated in whichchildren were denied enrollment in mainstream schools, the children are currentlyout of school. One is Yu Yuechun, a 13-year-old with an intellectualdisability, whose grandmother told Human Rights Watch that schools would notenroll him because “he can’t learn.” Prior to that, he wasexpelled from school after half a year.When he was seven he went to primary school for half ayear, but after he had fights with the other children, the schoolwouldn’t let him continue. Then we went looking for other schools, butthey said he can’t learn and wouldn’t take him.[92]Pressures to Leave and DismissalsThe struggle to enroll children with disabilities in mainstreamschools does not end when the child begins to attend classes. Several parents toldHuman Rights Watch that school administrators or teachers pressured them toremove their children from school. A parent-advocate who runs a rehabilitationcenter for autistic children and is the mother of an autistic boy told HumanRights Watch that many parents who come to her center have had bad experiences atmainstream schools:[A]t most you can stay there for one or two years beforeyou are very tactfully asked to leave. In my experience, it is difficult tofind a school and get admitted, but if you belong to the school district thenthey can’t refuse [to enroll] you…. They admit your child but findopportunities to tell you that they want you to transfer your child to anotherschool.[93]Although Zheng’s son has managed to stay in themainstream school, the teacher keeps suggesting that he “take a leave ofabsence” from school. In another case, the mother of Wang Le, a childwith a severe hearing impairment, told Human Rights Watch that after studyingin a mainstream school for half a year, the school tried to get her to transferhim to a special education school:[A]fter the teacherlearned more about him, the teacher told us once: “Mother of Wang Le, whydon’t you find another school? He is very smart, but he can’t hearanything. I’m afraid his talents would be wasted.” That’swhat the teacher said, it was put very nicely, but … where else could hego?[94]Li Shengrong, a 15-year-old girl with an intellectual disability,told Human Rights Watch that her school complained about her ability to learnand expelled her after alleging that she cheated on an exam. A number ofchildren with intellectual disabilities reported to Human Rights Watch thatschools used similar excuses regarding behavioral problems when expelling themor asking them to leave:There was a school near us but they dismissed me…. BecauseI didn’t learn well…. I didn’t know what to write duringexams. I was really bored so I looked at other [students]. The teacher saw meand told me to leave…. But I didn’t look at others’ [papers].[95]These students also told Human Rights Watch that they weredismissed from mainstream schools after they were neglected and bullied byteachers and fellow students. In the words of 16-year-old Chen Ping, who nowstudies in a private special education school for children with intellectualdisabilities:A math teacher gave me a scolding [after] he gave me zerosfor every exam, and then he said some very nasty things. I couldn’t standit … and when he told me to go home, I went home…. The principaltold me himself that because my math is no good, I should contact this [specialeducation] school.[96]Lack of Reasonable AccommodationYou’ve brought him to a normal environment, thus itis he who must adapt.—The mother of Zheng Jun, a boy with autism,recalling the words of his teacher at a mainstream school, January 2013.Human Rights Watch research found that little to noaccommodation is provided in mainstream schools for students with disabilitiesat all stages of education. Students with severe mobility impairments said theyneed to go up and down the stairs to get to their classrooms or use thebathrooms. Those with hearing impairments said they have no written notesprovided and there is no sign language instruction available; mainstreamschools described to Human Rights Watch do not readily provide visual aids,Braille, electronic materials, or enlarged texts for students with visualimpairments. Children with intellectual disabilities are expected to sitthrough the entire curriculum together with the rest of the class with littlemodification to the curriculum or teaching methods to meet their learningabilities and needs. None of the schools at which the interviewees study haveresource rooms.Our interviewees also described a lack of flexibility in theevaluation of student performance in the mainstream system, noting that schoolsfail to modify tests or exams to accommodate students with disabilities. Inhigher education, blind students are effectively barred from mainstreameducation because Braille or electronic exam papers are generally unavailableduring gaokao, while deaf students are severely disadvantaged aslistening exams are a requirement for a national standardized English testrequired for university graduation.Students with disabilities and their parents told HumanRights Watch that few teachers take the initiative to provide them withreasonable accommodation and, in some cases, teachers neglected or evenhumiliated them.[97] Whilea few said that their teachers have better teaching styles or provide them withbetter support, such efforts are inconsistent. Lack of support and training toteachers and school administrators, lack of funding to schools for inclusiveeducation, and the fact that evaluation of educators rarely takes into account theperformance of students with disabilities all contribute to schools’failures to ensure reasonable accommodation.The Role of TeachersOne important way of providing reasonable accommodation is tomodify teaching styles and methods. However, most parents and students withdisabilities interviewed responded negatively when asked whether teachersadjusted their teaching methods to meet their needs:Some individual teachers would take the initiative to askme if I understood, and that I could ask them anytime if I don’t … butthat’s very rare. In three years at university, I have experienced [suchinitiative from teachers only] five times. We have no examples [of accommodation].The teachers treated me the same as other students.[98]Students with intellectual disabilities are expected to sitthrough the entire curriculum together with the rest of the class — asone parent puts it, “even when they can’t understand.”[99] Worsestill, a number of students with intellectual disabilities or autism and theirparents reported to Human Rights Watch that teachers intentionally ignored themdue to their poor academic performance. Mother of Chen Xiaoling, who hasintellectual and visual impairments, said Chen was placed in the back of theclass.The teacher didn’t pay any attention to her, shedidn’t get any exams or homework, she just sat at school. The teacherdidn’t care which parts she didn’t understand…. Her eyesightis very bad…. She certainly couldn’t see anything. She was moved tothe back of the class because she couldn’t follow the class.[100]Similarly, the mother of Zheng Yu, who has an intellectualdisability, told Human Rights Watch:I bring the child to school and the teacher would let himin, but if he leaves [during school], the teacher doesn’t stop him….It’s like this every day. The school hasn’t given him textbooks butwe bought him some notebooks so he could draw.[101]A few intervieweesreported being given some accommodations in mainstream schools, but the effortsare inconsistent and sporadic at best, dependent on the attitudes of individualteachers and schools.[102]Some teachers have teaching styles that make iteasier for students with disabilities to follow. Sixteen-year-old Liu Yiyuansaid some of her teachers wrote down notes on the blackboard and spoke slowly;others did not write anything down and she “couldn’t keepup.”[103]None of her teachers provided written notes andthey walked around the classroom while teaching, sometimes standing at the backof the class.The accommodations also tend to be less available in highergrades, as teachers face greater time pressure to prepare students for gaokao.The mother of a 15-year old girl with a hearing impairment explained:[My daughter] mainly reads lips, but now in universitiesand high schools the teachers speak very quickly, and they can’t [always]talk facing you. In the past, her teachers were all very good, she was verylucky. [104]Whether or not a child is provided with accommodations inschools depends on the attitudes of teachers and school administrators. In thewords of Zheng Jun’s mother, it depends on “your luck if you meet ateacher or a principal who is relatively better.”[105] Ascholar focusing on inclusive education told Human Rights Watch that much of thevariation in teacher attitudes can be attributed to government failure toinstitutionalize the guarantee of “reasonable accommodation”:I have a student who was paid so little attention by theteachers between primary one and three that he felt he was like “a sheepput out to pasture.”… When he was in primary four, one teacherdiscovered that when he magnified the exam papers, the child performed verywell, so he then made large prints of the exam papers for this student…. Thiskind of support is not ensured by the system but stops at the level ofawareness and goodness of the hearts of the teachers.[106]Parents, students,teachers, and principals told Human Rights Watch that the main reasons for failureto provide reasonable accommodation are inadequate support to teachers andlarge class sizes. With 30 to 60 students in a mainstream school classroom andno support staff to care for children with disabilities, teachers have littletime to devote to individual students, much less to make adjustments toteaching styles, teaching materials, or evaluation mechanisms for the one ortwo students with disabilities in the class.[107]Liang Sisi, mother of a child with cerebral palsy, toldHuman Rights Watch that “with so many children in the class, the teachersis too busy” to care for her daughter. She added that the schoolprincipal was reluctant to enroll her child because the school had no extrahands to provide care for these students, and the responsibilities land on theteachers. She explained:The principal told me that there was a parent who broughthis child to school, but did not provide any care. So the teacher had to carrythe child on her back everywhere, and the teacher didn’t like it. So theprincipal said to me, “If we put your child in a class, I still have toobtain the consent of the teacher. If the teacher isn’t willing to acceptyour child then I can’t do anything for you.”[108]Such lack of support can also lead teachers to becomefrustrated with students with disabilities, according to two educators inmainstream schools who spoke with Human Rights Watch. One teacher told us thather student, a 6-year-old boy who has intellectual and mental disabilities,keeps hitting other students and doesn’t respond when she calls him,“as if he has no ears.”[109] Thechild’s academic performance “is just bad.”[110] Themother of Wang Le, a boy who has a severe hearing impairment, said his teacherwouldpoint a loudspeaker right at him but he still could notunderstand what the teacher said even though he wears a hearing aid. Sometimesthe teacher gets so mad.[111]Because of the lack of government or school support foreducators, as one parent put it, “it is the parent who provides thesupport.”[112] Thesame parent noted that when “the teachers are good, then they help you orask the other students to help you, but most of the time, the burden falls onthe parents.”[113] Insome cases, schools make the parents agree to provide support as a conditionfor enrollment, or the parents take the initiative to offer such support in abid to get their children enrolled.In China, the performance of many schools and teachers isevaluated on the basis of the average grades of students. Some schools treatstudents with disabilities as “audit students” or otherwise excludetheir grades from the class average in order to ensure that children withdisabilities do not lower the school’s overall score. For example, themother of Yang Shun, a 12-year-old girl with an intellectual disability, toldHuman Rights Watch:[The children with disabilities in this school] are allauditing, their grades are not recorded as part of the school’s overallgrades…. They didn’t ask us [for our opinions] about this…. Ifour children score zeros in tests then it affects the class scores in that yearlevel. Their class teacher is rated, and the substitute teacher as well. Since[children with disabilities] affect their ratings, they definitelywouldn’t [include our children’s scores.][114]One family described aschool principal’s calculation about whether to admit their daughter,basing his decision on her likely academic ability. The experience of Xu Lele,a 15-year-old girl with hearing and speech disabilities, illustrates thispoint. Her mother told us:The principal said, “For people like [your daughter],I suggest she go to the school for the deaf because our school does not havestudents like her.” I told him that my child would like to study [here]and he said, “She might want to study [here], but the question is whetheror not she can.”… Then he talked about making guarantees, that ifmy child can’t keep up in class, then she can’t take the exams orbe enrolled. After she was enrolled she did well, so she has been taking thesame tests as other students.[115]One teacher even toldthe mother of Zheng Jun, a child with autism, that “regardless of howwell or poorly he might be doing, it has no bearing on my performance[evaluation].”[116]Mrs. Zheng clearly feels that her son is beingdiscriminated against. She explained:He takes his exams together with others, but since primarytwo, the teacher hasn’t given him his grades… He minds such thingsvery much. He knows … Sometimes he said he did better than his classmatein the exams, but his classmate got a score and he didn’t.[117]Because the performance of students with disabilities doesnot form part of their or the school’s evaluation, teachers and schooladministrators often are not inclined to exert themselves on behalf of studentswith disabilities. Education officials acknowledged that there“isn’t any system of assessment for the quality of ‘studyalong with the class’ schemes.”[118]As one scholar who studies inclusive education puts it:The child’s performance is not included in theevaluation [of the teacher], so the teacher doesn’t care. He has so manystudents in his class. He has no energy, nor the willingness to take theinitiative to help such kind of children.[119]Lack of Training and FundingTeachers and school administrators lack training ininclusive education, while schools lack funding for providing support to theteachers to make accommodations possible.[120] Althoughthe Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities (LPDP) and theRegulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities (REPD) stipulate thatinstitutions that train mainstream teachers must include courses on teachingstudents with disabilities, a survey of these institutions show that only 13.9percent of them do so, and only a minority of those do so regularly.[121]Although on-the-job training is available from bureaus of education, thesessions are short and the number of teachers trained remains low. Mostteachers of students with disabilities still have not received such training,and there is no clear timeline to ensure that such standards are met for allmainstream teachers.[122]The principal of the school attended by Zheng Leyan, a girlwith an intellectual disability, told Human Rights Watch that he wished thather class teacher could be trained in special education. According to him, thelocal bureau of education has never made such arrangements. “I have noidea how they teach [children with disabilities],” he said.[123]Another principal told us that he has “never heardof” training available for teachers in mainstream schools designed forteaching children with disabilities, even though he has been at the school formore than a decade, while training for other basic teaching skills areavailable “from time to time.”[124]Mainstream schools often receive little or no funding toprovide accommodations for children with disabilities, even though Chineseregulations on disability and education stipulate that funding be allocated bylocal education bureaus to mainstream schools for that purpose.[125]In a 2006 survey, only 7.7 percent of mainstream schools that enrolled studentswith disabilities reported that their local bureaus of education had earmarkedsufficient funds for these children, while over half of the respondents saidthere was either no designated funding or that the funding was very little.[126]Educators interviewed by Human Rights Watch also said thatwhile they have to report to the local bureau of education that they havechildren with disabilities in the school, they receive no additional fundingfrom the bureau for the children.[127] Ratherthan being earmarked to ensure reasonable accommodations, available funding isused to waive miscellaneous fees and provide a small cash subsidy to thestudents with disabilities (the policy of “liangmian yibu” or“two waivers and one subsidy”), or goes to provide a small subsidyfor teachers to “motivate”[128] themto better educate students with disabilities in their classrooms.Lack of Transport to SchoolA number of parents told Human Rights Watch that they aretheir children’s sole means of transport. And for children withdisabilities affecting their mobility, when parents fall ill, are injured, orotherwise cannot afford to take the time to accompany their children to school,then the children are forced to stay home. Yang Ranran, mother of a boy with a mobilitydisability as a result of cerebral palsy, told Human Rights Watch of theirplight after she broke her leg:I fell and cut open my leg, so I couldn’t walk. If Ididn’t fall then, I could have carried him on my back…. We have noother way [to send him to school]. We don’t own our home and his fatherhas to go to work…. I spoke with the principal and told him that afterthe new year I’d bring him to school in a cart … but I’mafraid that I might not be able to pull the cart given my poor health.[129]There is no generaltransportation scheme to take students with disabilities to mainstream schools.In replies to an information disclosure request filed by a disability activistin February 2013, all six municipal and provincial education bureaus that directlyresponded to a question regarding provision of transport to students withdisabilities denied that lack of transportation was a problem for students withdisabilities, saying that students with disabilities either live in residentialfacilities or near the mainstream schools they attend.[130]This is very likely untrue for somemobility-impaired students, and for those who live near mainstream schools, a“short” trip to the school can be very long given their impairments.[131]As noted above, about 75 percent of people with disabilitiesin China live in rural areas, and government consolidation of mainstreamschools in rural areas is estimated to have closed down half of all ruralschools in the past decade.[132] This hasmeant that mainstream schools are now even further away from some ruralstudents.[133] Thisplaces an extra burden on parents because they need to organize transport or renta room near the schools to accompany their child. Some of these schools provideresidential facilities, but there is no support staff to take care of childrenwith disabilities.A number of parents of children with disabilities told HumanRights Watch that the distance to the nearest mainstream school was one of themain reasons their child was no longer attending school. For example, ChenXiaoling’s mother told us that Chen dropped out of school when she was 13because:The [village] school was closed and consolidated in2010…. If it was still here then I’d let her continue [in thevillage school].[134]Similarly, father of Zheng Leyan, who has an intellectualdisability, told Human Rights Watch that Zheng will drop out of school once shefinished primary four because he and his wife cannot afford to give up workingin the fields to accompany her to school, especially when she “can’tlearn.”No, it’s too far away. Thecentralized school is about 17-18 kilometers away. It’s not possible, wewould have to rent a flat [near the school], how is it possible?[135]The grandmother of 13-year-old Zhang Xiaoli, who has mobilityand intellectual disabilities and dropped out of school after finishing primaryschool, told Human Rights Watch the following about her granddaughter:She wants to study, and she’s cried about it. Shegraduated from primary school, but she cannot continue…. She could go tojunior high school, but the school is too far away. She can’t walk therebut she also doesn’t know how to ride a bike…. The main reason isstill no one to send her to and back from school.[136]Lack of Accessible Classrooms and MaterialsParents and students we interviewed also said thatmainstream schools and local governments fail to ensure that students withdisabilities both have easy access to their classrooms and are provided withalternative means of communication and assistive devices.While students with mild physical disabilities generallyhave few problems getting around school, those with more severe mobilityimpairments told Human Rights Watch that getting to school as well as gettingaround school is difficult. Liang Sisi, mother of a girl with cerebral palsy,told Human Rights Watch that much of her day is spent caring for her daughterat school:Their school has only one bathroom on the first floor [andher class is on the fourth floor]…. I bring her to school in the morning,and after two classes I go there again to help her to the bathroom, and againin the middle of the afternoon. I go back and forth many times.[137]Visual aids and large print materials are not readilyavailable for students with visual impairments in mainstream schools.[138] Theyalso typically do not offer Braille and are not equipped with Braille teachers.[139] As aresult, most students who are blind or with low vision go to special educationschools because they have better facilities than mainstream schools and becausemainstream schools are reluctant to accept them.Braille or electronic exam papers are also not readilyavailable during public university entrance exams including gaokao,which means that blind students are almost entirely excluded from mainstream highereducation. In 2012, Wang Qiuyi, a blind student who studied in a specialeducation school, applied for Braille papers for gaokao in ShandongProvince but the provincial bureau of education rejected her request. Thebureau’s explanation, according to a news report, was as follows:Even if Wang takes the exams, she would be unable toparticipate in class like normal students and since ordinary universitiescannot provide Braille textbooks, she cannot receive a normal education inordinary schools.[140]However, the LPDP stipulates that for “school entranceexams, career qualification exams and placement exams which blind people takepart in, Braille or electronic exam papers or assistance from specialized staffshall be available.”[141] The Regulationon the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments also has a similarrequirement.[142] Inresponse to an information disclosure request sent to all 31 provinces andmunicipalities, out of eight bureaus of education which responded directly tothe question only the Shanghai bureau said that it had provided Braille exampapers in the past four years.[143]In another case in 2011,Dong Li’na, a young blind woman, applied to the Beijing Bureau ofEducation to take qualification exams to become a radio host after shecompleted a tertiary level self-study course. According to media reports, thebureau struck down her request on grounds that there was “no suchprecedent” and that “[given her] physical condition [she] shouldnot participate in this professional examination.”[144]Dong later sought help from an anti-discriminationorganization, the Beijing Yirenping Center, which publicized her case widelyand filed complaints to the bureau. The bureau then promised to provide anaccommodation for Dong, and she took the series of exams starting in January2012. After this case, the Beijing Bureau of Education promised that suchaccommodations would be available to all people with visual impairments whotake professional tertiary-level qualifications exams in Beijing, and a coupleof other blind students have since been provided with electronic exam papersfor other subjects in Beijing.[145]Parents and young people with disabilities also told us ofarbitrary treatment in the distribution of hearing aids. Instead of ensuringthat children and young persons with hearing impairments are equipped withthese devices to meet their educational needs, interviewees told Human RightsWatch that the provision of these devices is often based on other criteria. Adisability rights activist said the hearing equipment is only given to thosewho are poor and children are not prioritized; a CDPF staff member said thatthey only distributed the devices if individuals make an application for them;a couple of parents said that they were only available to young children undera certain age limit.[146] Themother of a 16-year-old with hearing impairment who studies in a mainstreamschool told Human Rights Watch that her child was only able to afford a goodpair of hearing aids with the financial assistance of her uncle. The mothersaid:The CDPF told us to go [get hearing aids] but … theydidn’t give her any [because they said] she was too old and shewouldn’t be able to hear anything even if she’d be given hearingaids.Information about where and how to obtain these devices isalso not readily available to the parents. Two families we spoke with reportedthat their children had no hearing aids because they did not know how to applyfor them.[147]Whether or not a child with a hearing impairment gets a quality assistivedevice depends on a variety of factors and their own efforts to search forfunding. The government’s Regulations on the Education of People with Disabilities(REPD) do not mention the provision of assistive devices for students withdisabilities. A current university student who lost her hearing while she wasin secondary school told Human Rights Watch that she had to take a part-timejob to afford the hearing aid.It was during my first year in university that I struggledto earn money to buy myself hearing aids that cost several hundred renminbi,and later I met a sign language teacher who lent me money so I bought a coupleof better ones. Now I can hear in the classroom, but not clearly.[148]Lack of Appropriate Student Evaluation MechanismsStudents with disabilities are entitled, under a reasonableaccommodation framework, to have their academic abilities evaluated by methodsother than the fixed standards applied to other students in the educationalsystem. A Ministry of Education document entitled “Methods for Managing the‘Study Along with the Class’ Scheme for Persons with Disabilities(MMSACS)” stipulates that assessment of these students should be“flexible” and available in a variety of forms, as well as that theassessment of these students should be included in the “overallassessment of mainstream students” to “better integrate studentswith and without disabilities.”[149]While the policy looks good on paper, some parents toldHuman Rights Watch that schools failed to provide any modifications to homework,tests, or exams to accommodate their children. One child with cerebral palsy whowrites slowly has never been given extra time to write his exams. Another parentsaid the class teacher denied her request to reduce the volume of the writtenhomework assigned to her child, who has autism and is poor at responding toquestions in written format.[150] Yetanother interviewee with hearing impairments reported that she has to takeEnglish listening exams at schools.[151]Students with hearing impairments are exempted from the listeningportion of gaokao exams but not from the listening exams for the CollegeEnglish Test, which are national exams administered by the Ministry ofEducation. University students are often required to pass these exams in orderto graduate at both bachelor and graduate levels.[152] Asinterviewee Li Hongdan put it, she could “only guess” the answersto the listening test as she could barely hear anything.[153] Litried to speak to her teachers about providing accommodations during the internalschool assessment, but she was rebuffed.Some teachers understand, but they are in the minority; butsome teachers told me: “I won’t lower the assessment requirementsbecause of your condition. You have to do whatever other students have to do.”Study or Just “Muddle along with the Class”?The shortcomings described above fail not only students withdisabilities but their parents and teachers as well. Other than those involvingmild physical disabilities, in almost all the cases we examined the parents orchildren said they were failing academically or had already withdrawn from mainstreamschool. One aim of mainstreaming is to combat stereotypes and prejudices, but placingthese children in mainstream schools without ensuring reasonable accommodationsundermines this important goal.While some of our interviewees reported that they weretreated well in school, a number said they were treated badly by fellowstudents. Tong Ying, a 17-year-old girl with physical disabilities, told HumanRights Watch that she prefers special education school.Here we are all disabled, we are equal. I went tomainstream primary and junior middle school but I didn’t like them. I wasbeaten by teachers during primary school and bullied by fellow students. Lotsof other students looked down on me.[154]In turn, these barriers lead to declining confidence and alack of interest in learning among students with disabilities. Some eventuallydrop out while others transfer to special education schools. Eleven of ourinterviewees joined special education schools after they were rejected,effectively expelled, or otherwise excluded from the mainstream system. In oneinterview, Du Ting, a 15-year-old girl with a hearing impairment, left amainstream school because she was scolded and sworn at by fellow students, whofelt “she was lower than other children in the mainstream school.”[155] ChenXiaoling, who has intellectual and visual impairments, quit school afterprimary four because she “was afraid that others would laugh ather” due to her poor academic performance.[156] ChenYangfei left school in 2012 at age 8 because he had “no motivation tolearn” as a result of barriers due to hearing and speech impairments.[157]All of these barriers undermine the intended purpose ofinclusive education, which is to “respond to the diversity of needs ofall learners,”[158] andto ensure the “fulldevelopment of human potential and sense of dignity and self-worth.”[159]Limited Access to Higher EducationFew students with disabilities reach higher education. Thosewho do tend to be ones who have physical or mild disabilities, and they faceadditional barriers as a result of government policy.All students applying to universities must submit theresults of a detailed physical examination, along with their academic records,for consideration. These include a record of the student’s self-reportedmedical history, including the presence of disabilities, along with adoctor’s assessment.[160] The Ministryof Education, the Ministry of Health, and the CDPF have a set of guidelinesadvising universities on the type of “physiological defects” and“illnesses” that make a person “unable to take care ofthemselves or complete their studies,” and these can be grounds for denyingthem admission to universities in general.[161] Althoughonly “guidelines”, they send a clear signal to universities thatthey can discriminate in admissions on the basis of students’ physical ormental attributes or disabilities.Under each disability or illness, the guidelines list fieldsof study for which applicants may be denied admission based on their disabilityand fields of study for which they are “advised” not to apply. Manyof the qualifications requirements appear irrelevant to the subject, while someothers are not essential to success in the subject if the students are givenaccommodations and support. The official introductory note accompanyingthe guidelines states that schools cannot deny admission to people with“disabilities of the limbs whose disabilities do not affect one’slearning of the applied profession,”[162] a stepwhich is in the right direction but nonetheless flawed. The clause is limited byits terms to applicants with certain physical disabilities, and it still gives universityadministrators broad discretion to deny admission whenever they determine thata particular disability might “affect learning.”Ran Yanshan, who has a visual impairment as a result ofalbinism, told Human Rights Watch that he was denied admission to study aBachelor’s degree program in English at Guangxi University, his topchoice, after he failed to pass the visual component of the physicalexaminations.After I found out that Iwasn’t enrolled even though I had the required scores, I called theirenrollment office. They said “because of your physical conditions, youare not suitable for studying this subject.”… I felt pretty down atthe time, but I didn’t argue. I am used to discrimination against peoplewith disabilities, and I didn’t think there were ways to change theirviews.[163]The guidelines also put people with disabilities in adifficult position. If they state their conditions fully as required, they riskdiscrimination by the universities; if they fail to report their disabilities,they risk being subsequently rejected due to dishonesty. In past years, anumber of press reports have documented that several students with disabilitieswere rejected by universities for failure to report their disabilities.[164]According to the government’s guidelines,universities can refuse admission to people with epilepsy and otherneurological conditions or those with “serious mental illnesses thathave not been cured.”People with visual impairments, depending on theseverity of the impairment, can be denied admission to a dozen academicfields, including sports training, and are advised against applying to dozensof other fields including law and ecology.Admission requirements for the police academyexplicitly prohibit people with all disabilities from applying.People with physical disabilities are advisedagainst applying to more than 40 fields including environmental science andarcheology.People with hearing impairments are advised not tostudy over a dozen subjects including law and foreign languages andliterature.The guidelines also authorize universities to impose moredetailed restrictions based on characteristics of applicants as long as theyare consistent with the guidelines. For example:The 2009 enrollment charter of Capital MedicalUniversity, a prestigious public university in Beijing, states that“students with disabilities in the torso or the limbs…are notadmitted.”[165]The website of Capital University of Economicsand Business, another prestigious public university in Beijing, explains thatstudents with disabilities are welcome to apply only if “they can takecare of themselves” and if they “do not affect the learning ofothers.”[166]Jimei University in Fujian Province stipulatesthat students who wish to study navigation technology must be “healthyand handsome men over 1.65 meters tall who can speak clearly, have normalliver function, have an uncorrected visual acuity of 5.0 in both eyes, andhave no color blindness.”[167]It ishard to see how these criteria —having a “handsome”appearance and clarity of speech — can be justified as essential requirementsfor the subject. These standards could exclude many competent students,including those with physical or speech disabilities.Data available between 2001 and 2007 from the CDPF indicatesthat, on average, about 8.3 percent of candidates with disabilities were notadmitted even though they had obtained the required scores and that,encouragingly, the percentage has gradually declined over the years. Thisrelatively small percentage, however, must factor in how many students withdisabilities never reach higher education, as well as the reality that othersmay be dissuaded from applying to their preferred universities and academicfields by the government guidelines described above.Certain local bureaus of education as well as universitiesgive advice in the media as well as on their websites that encourages studentswith disabilities to “choose colleges and professions that fit theirphysical conditions.”[168] Studentswith disabilities told Human Rights Watch that they did take such an approachto increase the odds of entering universities. One told us:Most of my university friends who have hearing impairmentsand I chose subjects like accounting and fine arts. This is because from thebeginning we have avoided field of study that might reject us.[169]Another university student, Wang Lele, who has a physicaldisability, told Human Rights Watch that lack of information about the physicalexamination system and which schools might reject her on the basis of disabilitiesled her to avoid certain schools and subjects:I felt very [worried], I had to think, “Can I applyto these schools?” I didn’t know if they would enroll me even if Imet the academic requirements. I felt pretty depressed…. When I filled inmy university choices, I removed some schools which I thought would not takeme. But it wasn’t an informed choice.... There was no one I could consultto find out more about the situation.”[170]Ran Yanshan also told Human Rights Watch that prior to beingdenied admission to university on the grounds of his visual disability, he hadcarefully chosen subjects that do not have a strong visual requirement.I had a two-pronged strategy:first, I applied to study English because it shouldn’t have too high arequirement on visual abilities…. Second, I indicated in my applicationthat I would be willing to obey their subject arrangement, so if they think Iam not suitable to study English, I am willing to be allocated to anothersubject [by the university].[171]Discrimination in the Hiring of TeachersThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)requires that the Chinese government “employ teachers, including teacherswith disabilities, who are qualified in sign language and/or Braille,”prohibits discrimination in employment, and requires that employers providereasonable accommodations in the workplace.[172] Whilethere are teachers with disabilities in the special education system, governmentpolicies discriminate against them in the mainstream school system.The Ministry of Education’s Regulationsfor Implementation of >Teacher Qualifications, [173] which went into effect in2000, gave provincial governments autonomy in setting thecriteria for physical checkups to determine eligibility as a teacher, which ledto a proliferation of local policies and regulations that discriminate againstpeople with disabilities. A 2011 survey conducted by a disability rightsadvocate found that government policies on teachers’ qualifications in 20out of 21 provinces included provisions that discriminate against people withdisabilities.[174]For example, physical examination standards for teachers set out by Anhuiprovince list 19 types of disqualifying health conditions, including:“inability to hear within a 2 meter range in both ears,”“corrected vision of less than 5.0 in both eyes,” and “inability to move upper orlower limbs.”[175]An individual with anyof these health conditions is not eligible to be a teacher. Shanxi provincesets out a similar set of disqualifying criteria, such as “glaucoma,retinaandopticnerve diseases,color blindness,and colorweakness.”[176]These discriminatoryphysical examination standards have prevented people with disabilities fromentering the teaching profession and receiving equal treatment as teachers,according to media reports. Guo Sheng, who had childhood polio that left himwith limited mobility in the lower body, taught as a “temporary”substitute teacher for 20 years, as his height does not meet the requirement of“taller than 1.6 meters” as required for a male teacher.[177]In Anhui Province, the local board of educationrejected an application by Zhu Qihong, a middle school teacher who lost hisright arm, to qualify as a high school teacher because he did not meet thephysical standards.[178]Zhu was previously eligible to teach in middleschool as he had qualified before amendments were made to the Anhui physicalexamination standards of teachers in 2004. In Yunnan Province, the local boardof education reportedly refused to sign a teaching contract with a collegegraduate with a teaching degree after they found out that his left forearm wasamputated.[179]Problems with Special Education SchoolsBecause the gates for the special education schools arealways closed for security reasons, once the children are inside it is verydifficult for them to come out.— Lan Yingying, a scholar who studies China’sspecial education schools, April 2013.In general, special education schools in China have trainedteachers and appropriate equipment and facilities and are resourced and fundedwell. Over half of the students we interviewed who studied in this system saidthey like studying in these schools. Most of the students who transferred tothese schools from mainstream schools noted that their new teachers give thembetter and more individualized support, and they report that they are generallyhappier and more confident in these schools.However, there are a number of problems with the specialeducation system. The schools are far away from some of their prospectivestudents. Most are isolated from their immediate communities and do not servecertain disability populations, notably students with autism. The slower paceof progress through the curricula, limited subject choices beyond basiceducation level, and lower academic standards make it difficult for students torejoin the mainstream system.Lack of AccessThere are currently 1,767special education schools in China, which, given the size of the country, meansthey are still few and far between compared to mainstream schools.[180]Moreover, special education schools tend to belocated in urban or administrative centers, and thus are especially difficultto reach for students who live in rural areas (as noted above, 75 percent ofpeople with disabilities in China live in rural areas).[181]Even if there are special education schools in aparticular area, they may serve a specific disability — such as hearing,visual, or intellectual disability — and children with other disabilitiesmay still need to travel long distances.[182]Some students have to be removed from theirfamilies and communities from a young age to study in these schools, most of whichprovide residential facilities.Six out of 17 Human Rights Watch interviewees who study inspecial education schools live in the schools. Some of these students returnhome on weekends, while some do so only during longer holidays every severalmonths. Parents told Human Rights Watch that they are deterred from sendingtheir children to these schools as they prefer to have their children livingwith them:The schools are too far away. She doesn’t know how tocare for herself and someone will have to take care of her. She can’teven carry her own bath water, she’s too young and she can’t takecare of herself. The [mainstream] schools here are closer, she’s solittle — I can take care of her here [at home].[183]Attendance at such remote special education schools canimpact the psychological health of the children too. Chen Fei, a teacher in aresidential special education school, told Human Rights Watch that manychildren are no longer “used to living at home” with their familiesand would prefer not to visit home.We observed that for children under 11 or 12 years old, ifthey live in schools for a long time then they develop communication andemotional [attachment] problems with their parents…. The main problem isthat they lack understanding of life at home and the entire society in generalbecause they have such a narrow and fixed social circle.[184]Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons withDisabilities (CRPD) obliges states to ensure that people with disabilitiesenjoy “ full inclusion andparticipation in the community” and prevent “isolation or segregation from thecommunity.” However, a number of interviewees reported thatstudents at special education schools are discouraged from leaving the gatedpremises, and the students have little interaction with people and placesoutside.All students have to live in the schools and can only gohome during the weekends. This is done for safety reasons — because allthe students have disabilities … they are afraid of accidents.[185]The special education system is especially difficult forchildren — such as those with autism — who do not fit under any of theofficial disability categories and who thus do not have their own dedicatedspecial education schools. As they are rejected by mainstream schools as well,their only alternative is often expensive privately run special educationschools. One parent told Human Rights Watch:In 2010, the first and only government school for childrenwith intellectual disabilities was established in our city. There were only 200seats and … they didn’t try [to enroll] kids with autism….Their enrollment capacity is limited, so this kind of children [with autism]are basically excluded because one cannot control their behavior ... thesechildren cannot even go to publicly run special schools for children withintellectual disabilities.[186]Lower Academic Standards and Limited Subject ChoicesAnother problem with special education institutions is thatthe academic standards lag behind those of mainstream schools, which makes itdifficult for students to cross back into the mainstream system.[187]According to an education expert in China:The higher education system has not opened doors to thosefrom special education schools, and as a result these schools lack a motivatingmechanism…. Instead, [students from special education schools] might goto those very simple special education colleges with designated seats forstudents with disabilities, which have very low enrollment standards.[188]The Chinese governmenthas provided people with disabilities with opportunities beyond compulsoryeducation, but they are usually restricted to vocational training in specialeducation schools or special education colleges.[189]The Regulations on the Education of Persons withDisabilities (REPD) states that “priority is given to … vocationaleducation” while “education at or above senior middle schoollevel” is being “gradually developed.”[190]The types of skill training available in the specialeducation system are limited, especially for students with visual and hearingimpairments, and appear to be based on stereotypical views of disabilities andmarket availability.[191] Forexample, massage and music are available for the blind, and visual arts andbeauty for those who are deaf or who have hearing impairments. This isinconsistent with article 24 (1) of the CRPD, which obligates states to ensurethat education aims to develop to the “fullest potential” of peoplewith disabilities. A15-year-old boy with a visual impairment who is studying at a special educationschool told Human Rights Watch:I have some background in massage, I learnt it from Primary3 to Secondary 1 … because it was a class arranged by the teachers, youcan’t refuse. For deaf kids there is cake decorations or beautytreatment. Because we are blind, there is only one [vocational trainingoption]: massage.[192]Another recent graduate froma special education technical college told Human Rights Watch that students in his college are also placed indifferent vocational training classes depending on their disabilities — massagefor the blind, fashion design for the hearing impaired, computer studies forthose with physical disabilities. He was trained in massage and he works as amasseur, but he doesn’t like it.I don’t like massage,and I estimate that 80 percent of those who are blind don’t like iteither, because it was a forced choice, not a voluntary choice…. Ibelieve lots of people would wish to study in ordinary schools where they canchoose more reasonable professions…. [If mainstream] universities areopened up [to us], there will be more opportunities.[193]In another example, at Special Education College ofChangchun University, one of the 18 mainstream higher education institutions inChina that have special education colleges for students with disabilities, onlyfive subjects are available.[194] Theyare acupuncture and massage, musical performance, painting, art, and design andanimation. A major in special education is only available for“able-bodied” students.[195]Failures of the China Disabled Person’s Federationand the Ministry of EducationRights? What are these rights?... We don’t know thesethings, and we don’t dare to raise these demands to the school. I’mhappy as long as they let us stay in class, even if there are other issues atschool. I don’t dare to raise [rights.]—Mother of an eight-year-old boy with hearingimpairments, Guangdong Province, February 2013.Parental attitudes and resources play an important role in determiningwhether children with disabilities can overcome the multiple barrierspreventing them from attending school or getting a proper education. In somecases, however, parents and grandparents themselves are the first barrier: theydo not think that their children are capable of learning and thus do not bringthem to school. To ensure that children with disabilities have access toeducation, a critical step is to inform parents about their children’sright to education and their educational options.The parents we spoke with said they had little regularcontact with the China Disabled Persons’ Federation (CDPF) or theMinistry of Education regarding their children’s education, had little awarenessof their children’s right to education and to “reasonableaccommodation” in mainstream schools, and had little information aboutthe special education schools near them.Lack of Information and Outreach to ParentsWhen parents already have little confidence in theirchildren’s ability to learn, barriers in the education system add to theequation, tipping the balance towards not bringing their children to school. Thegrandmother of 12-year-old Zheng Ding, who has cerebral palsy, told HumanRights Watch that he has no ability to learn because he has no strength in hislimbs or torso:How can he go to school? He can’t sit properly, hecan’t even hold a piece of cake steadily! His hands don’t work —how can he go to school? He watches TV every day, so if there is an idiom [onTV that] he doesn’t understand, he asks me.[196]Zheng lives in a Cantonese-speaking area, but he learned tounderstand Mandarin from the cartoons he watched. He has no friends and onlyventures out when his grandparents have a moment to carry him on their backsfor a walk.Lu Xiaoyan, a 14-year-old who has a physical disability,told Human Rights Watch that she would really like to go to school, but herfather said she cannot because “everything is inconvenient” atschool, she cannot even “eat a meal on her own,” and that there isno one who can care for her there.[197]Similarly, 13-year-old Zhang Xiaoli wanted to go to secondary school after shefinished primary education, but her grandmother has never brought her therebecause the school is too far away and she cannot arrange the transportation.She worries that the school would not enroll Zhang, and explained that she“cannot learn” anyway.[198]While in theory two systems of education are available tochildren with disabilities, parents have little knowledge about specialeducation schools and how their children can get access to them.[199]When asked whether she knows about special education schools, the grandmotherof Yu Yuechun, a 13-year-old dismissed from school because of his intellectualdisability, told Human Rights Watch:No, I don’t know that kind of school…. Hisfather is working far away from home and I’m going on 80 years, I’mtoo old to figure these things out.[200]Parents of children with disabilities who spoke with HumanRights Watch also have little knowledge about the type of support andmodifications that could have helped their children get a quality education inmainstream schools. A number of parents we interviewed said that they did notexpect the class to adapt to their children, since it is their children who arethe problem, especially because the class size is often big and the teacher isalready very busy with the other children. One parent told us:It is your child who is the problem. He is faulty…. Theteacher has to teach 50 normal children so she can’t just teach your onechild, he learns whatever he manages to learn.[201]Because mainstream schools can refuse to enroll childrenwith disabilities or ask them to leave, some parents with disabilities areoften grateful that their children can go to school. To them, asking forsupport for their children would be “a luxury.”[202] Oneparent explained to Human Rights Watch:She is enrolled right now and as long as she keeps up withthe class then that’s OK. The teacher said that if she can’t keepup, then she would not be counted as enrolled. This teacher has given us preferentialtreatment.[203]According to a disability rights activist who frequentlyvisits children with disabilities in rural areas, parents almost never ask forany form of accommodation.One parent told me that he has been bringing his son to hisclassroom because of physical barriers at school … but when he is inhigher grades, the whole class will move to the third floor. So I said,couldn’t you ask them not to move his class? The parent said “No,they can’t possibly affect everyone just because of him alone.”[204]Although the CDPF maintains a comprehensive database ofchildren with disabilities who have disability cards and reaches out to some ofthem regularly by conducting home visits, it fails to consistently help themand their parents identify and surmount barriers to education. Almost all thechildren interviewed by Human Rights Watch who were out of school havedisability cards issued by the CDPF, but only two have regular contact withmembers of the CDPF. Of the two, only one was contacted about education: afterthe child, who has hearing and speech impairments, was dismissed from schooland no other mainstream schools nearby were willing to take him, the CDPF helpedto place him in a special education school.[205]The rest of the interviewees said they had no contact with the CDPF afterobtaining disability cards.Yang Ranran, the mother of a 14-year-old with mobilityimpairment who is currently out of school due to lack of transport, told HumanRights Watch:About three years ago … I brought my child back to myhometown to get a disability card…. It took them a year to send the cardback … but the CDPF has never given us any subsidies or any other help,we just got an identification card.[206]The lack of outreach and information is especially problematicin rural areas. Parents often go to work in cities and leave their children inthe care of grandparents, who often have little education or few resources tonavigate the barriers to education. When asked whether the CDPF has contactedher about Zhang Xiaoli’s education, Zhang’s grandmother told HumanRights Watch:The CDPF has never contacted me and I have never contactedthe CDPF…. I am uneducated and I don’t even know what to ask fromthem.[207]A former staff member at an international disabilityorganization that has programs in China said that this lack of information,coupled with “a lack of a proper referral system,” makes it hardfor parents of children with disabilities to find out where and how they canget their children educated or get access to services.[208]The grandmother of Zheng Ding, who has cerebral palsy, told us:No, nobody has ever asked us about[his education] … the CDPF has never visited us. It was only throughsomeone in the village that I heard about a rehabilitation center [run by theCDPF] in the county town.[209]Failure to Fight Discrimination and Ensure Reasonable AccommodationWhen confronted with discrimination, students withdisabilities and their parents sometimes seek help from the CDPF. The CDPFplays the role of the broker between parents and schools to find solutions.CDPF official Zheng Wei told Human Rights Watch that he had handled three casesof denied admissions — and he got the children enrolled in schools oftheir choice after first talking to the schools and then to the local bureau ofeducation to put pressure on the schools.[210]However, a number of parents complained to Human RightsWatch about CDPF interventions. The mother of Chen Yufei, a boy with Attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability, explained that the CDPF failed toact after she told them about her boy being rejected by mainstream schools:When he applied for the subsistence allowance, the CDPFsent someone to ask about his situation. I told him all about [being deniedadmission to school] but nothing happened…. Only the application for thesubsistence allowance went through and we get a bit of money every month, butit was otherwise useless. They’d come to send their regards during thenew year, send us a barrel of cooking oil, that’s about it.[211]Song Jianjun, the mother of an autistic son, told us thatthe CDPF and the local bureau of education avoided addressing her son’ssituation. Her son was denied enrollment by the local mainstream school and theclosest special education school only admits children with visual, hearing, andintellectual disabilities, leaving him effectively without education. She said:We have a parents’ organization and we petitioned[the government] several times. We went to the Bureau of Civil Affairs, to theCDPF, to every one of them. But their response was, basically, to kick usaround like balls. They said, for matters concerning special education, youshould talk to the Bureau of Education; but the Bureau of Education said [thesechildren] are disabled, so those should be matters for the CDPF. And thenanother one says there is no national policy on this issue, what could we doabout it?[212]A CDPF official, speaking on condition of anonymity, toldHuman Rights Watch that the quasi-governmental organization’sintervention is often not to ensure reasonable accommodation, but to take thepath of least resistance. This often results in placing the children in specialeducation schools.In practice we treat people with disabilitiesdifferently…. When [mainstream] schools refuse to accept children withdisabilities, they send them to the CDPF for an evaluation. For all those whohave [CDPF-issued] disability cards, the CDPF makes them go to the localspecial education primary school … this is illegal! Nine years ofcompulsory education — [the CDPF] should help people with disabilities todefend their rights! They should have resolutely prohibited [mainstream] schoolsfrom denying them admission! But the CDPF is doing the opposite.[213]Theoretically, those facing discrimination could take legalaction against the schools or the government. But as one parent explained, she“…doesn’t understand such things.”[214]The Ministry of Education has also contributed to theproblem by failing to take action in cases of discrimination. In response to aninformation disclosure request sent to all 31 provincial and municipal bureausof education by a disability activist in 2013, only five bureaus directlyanswered a question about denying admission to children with disabilities.[215] Thosefive — which included the bureau for Gansu Province — wrote thatthey had never taken any action against schools for denying admission becausethey had “never found” any such incidents or “never receivedany such complaints,”[216]aclaim that seems implausible on its face. Indeed, one of the cases weinvestigated for this report involved discriminatory denial of admission to adisabled child by a school in Gansu Province.[217]Human Rights Watch was able to find and interview only oneperson with a disability who had taken legal action against discrimination. ZhengShaoliang told Human Rights Watch that he tried to sue a university after itrejected his application but accepted those of other applicants with lowerscores, which he believed to be the result of discrimination based on hisphysical disability. But the courts would not register the case. In his ownwords:[The court] said the school has autonomy over enrollment,so this does not belong to the remit of administrative lawsuits, also becausethe school is not an administrative department. I said it is a civil case,and [the court administrator] said it isn’t. I asked him “Whatkind of a case is this then?” He said “Not everything can beresolved through lawsuits.”… I see what is written in the law,but it has lots of flexibility, so what can I do? Anyway, I tried petitioningthe provincial governments and other courts, but none of them would take thecase.[218]Zheng said the CDPF offered to help by hiring him alawyer, but later withdrew its support because the lawyer said it wasunlikely for him to win because the CDPF did not wish to confront agovernment department higher up in the hierarchy:The CDPF, I tell you, it does not dare to confront thosehigher up, they are willing only to send messages down [the hierarchy]. Ispoke with them many times. I also arranged for a group of journalists tointerview the provincial CDPF, but the CDPF told them they could donothing…. The CDPF has very limited ability; there is no use askingthem for help.[219]Lack of Awareness of DisabilityRightsThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)requires that governments adopt “immediate, effective and appropriatemeasures”[220] toraise awareness in society about people with disabilities, combat stereotypesabout them, promote respect for their abilities and contributions, and, importantly,encourage society to view people with disabilities as “independent andautonomous rights holders” with dignity equal to other human beingsrather than as objects of pity and charity.[221]Despite its ratification of the CRPD, the Chinese governmentcontinues to use pejorative terms to refer to people with disabilities. Theterm for people with disabilities, canjiren, which is used in officialdocuments including the official translation of the CRPD and is prevalent amongChinese people, literally means “impaired and sick people.”[222]In its review of China, the Committee on the Rights of Persons withDisabilities noted “the prevalence of the medical model,” ratherthan the social model, in the government’s definition of disability,official discourse, and official awareness-raising campaigns.[223]The Committee also pointed out that the government tended to“depict people with disabilities as helpless and dependent human beingssegregated from the rest of society.”[224] Inawareness-raising events and disability-related meetings, the government hasstressed the importance of caring for people with disabilities in communities.[225]While it is commendable for the government to encourage students to love and tocare for fellow students with disabilities, that alone does not fulfill thegovernment’s legal obligations under the CRPD. Li Hongdan, a 22-year-olduniversity student with a hearing impairment, described a “help thedisabled” event jointly organized by the school and the CDPF:The official volunteers at the school…have regularactivities to ‘help the disabled,’ which is to gather our friendswith disabilities and go for a walk at the park. And then these students wouldpush the wheelchairs enthusiastically for photo-ops. I’m particularlydisgusted about this…. Every time it’s the same people withdisabilities while there is no help where the real needs are.[226]The government also fails to engage in robust publiceducation efforts to inform parents and people with disabilities about theireducational rights. The Committee specifically asked the government to“inform all people with disabilities, especially those living in ruralareas, of their rights, specifically the right to … attendschools.”[227]Although a number of provincial and municipal bureaus of education have said theyprovided “some” funding for events to publicize the right toeducation for people with disabilities, it is unclear how much they have done.[228]The CDPF has a “rights defense department”[229]within the organization that aims to “publicize the implementation”of the Law on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities (LPDP) and otherdisability-related regulations and to “enhance the rights awareness ofpeople with disabilities,”[230] accordingto some of its work reports. Yet a CDPF staff member who is also a disabilityrights activist in his private capacity told Human Rights Watch:You see the LPDP and the CRPD? They’re just there togather dust…. The CDPF prints out all these and hands them out randomly,it’s just window-dressing.... The CDPF isn’t like us — whenwe hand them out, we talk to people about it, just as I explained this and thatparagraph to you.[231]Most parents of children with disabilities drew a blank whenasked about the educational rights of their children. As one parent put it:Rights? What are these rights?... We don’t know thesethings, and we don’t dare to raise these demands to the school. I’mhappy as long as they let us stay in class, even if there are other issues atschool. I don’t dare to raise [rights].[232]Positive Examples: Progress toward Inclusive EducationIs Possible Even with Limited ResourcesSome municipalities and provinces in China, especially incoastal regions, are making efforts toward a more inclusive education system.In Beijing, for example, the municipal government has announced that it willstop building more special education schools and instead will shift resourcesto integrate students into mainstream schools. It says it will improve thephysical accessibility of mainstream schools and hire “rehabilitationteachers” to provide support to students with disabilities.[233]Beijing municipal authorities have also reportedly established “resourcecenters” to provide support to teachers of students with disabilities inmainstream schools.[234] Beijingand other cities in more developed parts of the country, including Shanghai,Qingdao City in Shandong Province, and Guangzhou City in Guangdong Province,have also established “resource rooms” in mainstream schools.[235]The bureau of education in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has alsoreportedly equipped all new schools with accessibility features and convertedfour mainstream schools to improve accessibility in recent years.[236]Inclusive education does not have to be costly. For example,to improve physical accessibility it might be sufficient to move a classroom tothe ground floor with no further building modifications necessary. Even wheremodifications are necessary to ensure that buildings are physically accessibleto people with disabilities, making the necessary adjustments usually costs only1 percent of the overall building cost.[237]With some other disabilities, such as hearing impairments ordeafness, modifications to teaching technique can make huge differences. InBeijing’s Chaoyang District, the bureau of education reportedly trainsteachers to accommodate students with disabilities.[238]Teachers are taught to avoid walking around the classroom while talking, tokeep background noise to a minimum in the classroom, to consider the contrastof colors in designing teaching materials and presentations, and to pairstudents with hearing and visual impairments and those without to provide someassistance in class.The costs are often higher, of course, for students withmore severe and multiple disabilities. Even in these cases, however, simpleaccommodations can still be helpful in aiding learning. And in these cases, thegovernment can mobilize parents and set up parents’ networks to providesupport to the students. But it is essential that parents be given a choice asto whether or not to play a support role and be given resources, training, andsupport when they choose to do so. While providing accommodations to studentswho need the most support can be expensive, it is important to keep in mindthat developing and maintaining a separate and complex special education schoolsystem — as is the case in China — might cost more than accommodatingmost students with disabilities within an inclusive system.[239]Some provincial government authorities have shown aninterest in improving access to mainstream schools and a willingness to testout inclusive education approaches. Hopefully, through these initiatives the nationalMinistry of Education and its provincial and local offices will recognize thatinclusive education can be achieved and reasonable accommodation can beprovided, make commitments to replicating successful projects nationally, anddevelop a national strategy on inclusive education.RecommendationsIt is critical for the Chinese government to immediatelyreview and revise its laws and regulations to provide clear legal definitionsof non-discrimination and reasonable accommodation, consequences fornon-compliance, and an effective redress mechanism to deal with potentialgrievances. The government should also affirm its commitment to inclusiveeducation and formulate a concrete plan to ensure that teachers and schooladministrators are provided with adequate funding, training, and an evaluationmechanism that motivates and supports teachers to carry out inclusiveeducation. Central to this plan are parents and children and young people withdisabilities — the government should ensure that they are informed aboutchildren’s educational rights and options and empower them to getinvolved in the formulation and implementation of the plan at all levels ofeducation. Only then will education of students with disabilities be more thanjust “muddling along with the class” and genuine inclusiveeducation become a reality.To the NationalPeople’s CongressRevise the Regulations on the Education ofPeople with Disabilities (REPD) to bring them in line with the Convention onthe Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD). Specifically, the newregulations should:State clearly that the Chinese government’s overarchinggoal in the education of people with disabilities is full inclusion at alllevels of education and define “inclusive education” in accordancewith article 24 of the CRPD.Define “reasonable accommodation” in the amendedregulations in accordance with article 2 of the CRPD, and stipulate that the Ministryof Education and its local offices are responsible for ensuring that schoolsand examination boards provide people with disabilities with reasonableaccommodation within the general education system, including the use and teachingof Braille and sign language. Remove the phrase “able to adapt themselves to study inordinary classes” from the REPD because it allows mainstream schools todiscriminate against potential students on the basis of physical or mentalcharacteristics or abilities; remove the phrase and any comparable discrimination-enablinglanguage from all other education laws and regulations.State explicitly that mainstream schools whichrefuse to admit students or effectively expel them on the basis of disabilitiesare subject to sanction by the Ministry of Education.To the Ministry of EducationDevelop a time-bound, strategic plan to movetoward an inclusive education system that delivers quality education. Such a planshould include:Specific timelines with measurable goals.An adequate budget that includes financial and other support toprovincial and municipal bureaus of education which might not have adequateresources to deliver inclusive education.Measures to ensure that resources, including teachers, expertise,and equipment, are shifted from developing the special education system to makingthe mainstream system inclusive. A plan to train teachers, school administrators, and educationofficials at “all levels of education” in “disabilityawareness and the use of appropriate augmentative and alternative modes, meansand formats of communication, educational techniques and materials to supportpeople with disabilities,” as required by article 24(4) of the CRPD.Such a plan should be drawn up in consultation with independentdisabled peoples’ organizations and parents’ organizations in thecountry.With the assistance of the Ministry ofHealth and the China Disabled People Federation (CDPF), immediately repeal theGuidelines for the Physical Examination of Students in Recruitment for OrdinaryHigher Level Educational Institutions which sanction disability-baseddiscrimination in higher education.Develop guidelines for the effectiveevaluation of students with disabilities studying in mainstream schools andensure that their educational progress is reflected in the performanceassessment of their teachers and schools.Provide financial and other resources,including adequately trained staff, to mainstream schools so that they canensure the provision of reasonable accommodation for pupils and students withdisabilities.Impose penalties on managers of mainstream schoolsthat refuse admission to or expel students on the basis of disability, denyreasonable accommodation, or otherwise discriminate against students withdisabilities by act or omission.Provide accessible transport to enablechildren with disabilities to access schools, especially in rural areas wheredistances to schools are great and the number of schools has been reduced.Establish formal mechanisms in schools atall levels of education for the active involvement of parents and children andyoung people with disabilities to ensure that they participate inconsultations, decision-making, and monitoring processes in the implementationof inclusive education.Provide training in the principles of inclusiveeducation to staff at CDPF and independent disability organizations to enablethem to support families with children with disabilities.Encourage people with disabilities to applyfor positions in the education profession by:Amending the Regulations for Implementation of Teacher Qualifications toremove provisions which allow local governments to disqualify candidateteachers based on physical or mental characteristics not relevant to theparticular job. Providing them with the necessary reasonable accommodations.Establish an independent body made up ofindependent disability experts and representatives of children withdisabilities and their parents to:Monitor the school system’s compliance with relevant lawsand regulations. Receive complaints about discrimination and lack of reasonableaccommodation at mainstream schools.Identify remaining barriers to quality and inclusive educationfor students with disabilities.Make recommendations on actions the Ministry of Education cantake to ensure access to inclusive education.Together with the China Disabled PeopleFederation and independent disability organizations, develop outreach programsto:Ensure that parents are informed of their children’srights to an inclusive education, reasonable accommodation, andnon-discrimination.Provide assistance to these families to make sure that theyenjoy these rights in practice.Together with the CDPF and independentdisability organizations, improve the distribution of assistive devicesincluding visual and hearing aids and teaching materials such as Braille andlarge print textbooks, to children with disabilities in mainstream schools andcoordinate such distribution with the schools.Ensure that special education institutions donot unduly segregate children with disabilities from the broader school-agepopulation or from their families. Such can be accomplished by bringing childrenwith and without disabilities into regular contact for activities and classes andallowing children with disabilities in residential facilities to reunite withtheir families as often as possible by providing more frequent freetransportation between the schools and the students’ homes. Ensure that parentsand children with disabilities are informed of their educational choices,including the option to send their children to special education schools.To the Ministry of HealthTogether with the CDPF and the Ministry ofEducation, improve the early identification of disabilities in children andprovide more comprehensive and regular individualized health and educationalassessment for children with disabilities beyond simply issuing disabilitycards, which only note broad and simple disability categories.To the Ministry of Civil AffairsRemove all forms of restrictions on nongovernmentalorganizations, especially those related to formal legal registration, andprovide financial and other support to encourage the growth of independentdisability organizations.AcknowledgmentsThis report was reviewed and edited by Sophie Richardson,China director; Bede Sheppard, senior researcher in the Children's RightsDivision; Shantha Rau Barriga, Disability Rights Division director; GeneralCounsel Dinah Pokempner; and Joseph Saunders, deputy program director.

According to this annual bulletin, 398,700 studentswith disabilities attended special education schools while 225,200 of themattended mainstream school in 2011. However, the Chinese government stated inits state report to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in2010 that 159,000 students studied in special education schools while 269,000students attended mainstream schools. The discrepancy between Ministry ofEducation’s annual educational statistics bulletin and the state partyreport figures are great, with one suggesting students with disabilities aremostly in mainstream schools, the other suggesting the opposite. Here we haveused the statistics from Ministry of Education for two reasons. First, allschools report to Ministry of Education about the number of students withdisabilities and its figures are more likely to provide an accurate count. Second,Ministry of Education’s annual statistical bulletin has provided figureson students with disabilities since 1988, providing a bigger dataset to workwith. We remain concerned about the discrepancies in data from these twosources, however; the discrepancies suggest caution is in order in interpretingany statistical information regarding students with disabilities in China.[26]The figure, 28 percent (or more precisely, 27.9 percent), comes from the CDPF,“2011 annual national disability status and well-off process monitoringreport” (2011年度全国残疾人状况及小康进程监测报告),September 13, 2012, p.10,https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdpf.org.cn%2Flilun%2Fcontent%2Fsite281%2F20120927%2F0023ae64b1ad11ce389605.doc&ei=2GidUeHnCPCSiQe58YDYDA&usg=AFQjCNEFhu5TGleuxyu_11B2nx7PuxWEUQ&sig2=2w_aXNrK2tgj7GMaQlolZg(accessed May 23, 2013). However, the percentage becomes 17 percent if usingthe following official figures: : the number of children out of school(126,000, data available from the CDPF) and the number of children withdisabilities in school (398,700 in special education schools plus 225,200 inmainstream schools, data available from Ministry of Education). Calculations:126,000/(126,000+398,700+225,200)x100%=16.8%.Asdiscussed in footnote 25, the different official statistics for the number ofstudents in mainstream schools and those in special education schools alsoseriously contradict each other.
