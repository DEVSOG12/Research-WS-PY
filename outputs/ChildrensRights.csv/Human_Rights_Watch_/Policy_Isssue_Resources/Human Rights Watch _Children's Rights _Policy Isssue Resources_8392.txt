SummaryIlived in upstate New York for 10 years with my four children and my wife ... ICEsaid I was deportable because of an old marijuana possession conviction where Inever served a day in jail, just paid a fine of $250 ... They took me to VarickStreet [detention center in New York City] for a few days and then sent mestraight to [detention in] New Mexico. In New York when I was detained, I wasabout to get an attorney through one of the churches, but that went away oncethey sent me here to New Mexico.... All my evidence and stuff that I need isright there in New York. I’ve been trying to get all my case informationfrom New York ... writing to ICE to get my records. But they won’t giveme my records, they haven’t given me nothing. I’m just representingmyself with no evidence to present.[1]Each year in the United States, several hundred thousandnon-citizens[2](378,582 in 2008) are arrested and detained by Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE) officials. They are held in a vast network of more than 300detention facilities, located in nearly every state in the country. Only a fewof these facilities are under the full operational control of ICE—the majorityare jails under the control of state and local governments that subcontractwith ICE to provide detention bed space.Although non-citizens are often first detained in a locationnear to their place of residence, for example, in New York or Los Angeles, theyare routinely transferred by ICE hundreds or thousands of miles away to remotedetention facilities in, for example, Arizona, Louisiana, or Texas. Detainees canalso cycle through several facilities in the same or nearby states. Previouslyunavailable data obtained by Human Rights Watch show that over the 10 yearsspanning 1999 to 2008, 1.4 million detainee transfers occurred. The largenumbers of transfers are due to ICE’s broad use of detention as a tool ofimmigration control, especially after restrictive immigration laws were passedin 2006, and the absence of effective policies and standards to preventunnecessary transfers.Any governmental authority holding people in its custody,particularly one responsible for detaining hundreds of thousands of people indozens of institutions, will at times need to transport them betweenfacilities. In state and federal prison systems, for example, inmate transfersare relatively common, even required, in order to minimize overcrowding,respond to medical needs, or properly house inmates according to their securityclassifications. Transfers in state and federal prisons, however, are muchbetter regulated and rights-protective than transfers in the civil immigrationdetention system where there are few, if any, checks. The difference in theways the US criminal justice and immigration systems treat transfers is doublytroubling because immigration detainees, unlike prisoners, are technically notbeing punished. But thus far ICE has rejected recommendations to placeenforceable constraints on its transfer power.This report examines the scope and human rights impacts ofUS immigration transfers. It draws on extensive, previously unpublished ICEdata Human Rights Watch obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request,as well as scores of interviews with detainees, family members, advocates,attorneys, and officials. As detailed below, we found that such transfers areeven more common than previously believed and are rapidly increasing in number,more than doubling from 2003 (122,783) to 2007 (261,941) and likely exceeding300,000 in 2008 once the final numbers are in. The impact on detainees andtheir families is profound.Transfers erect often insurmountable obstacles todetainees’ access to counsel, the merits of their cases notwithstanding.Transfers impede their rights to challenge their detention, lead to unfairmidstream changes in the interpretation of laws applied to their cases, and canultimately lead to wrongful deportations.Transfers also take a huge personal toll on detainees andtheir families, often including children. As one attorney who representsimmigration detainees explained:The transfers are devastating—absolutely devastating.[The detainees] are loaded onto a plane in the middle of the night. They haveno idea where they are, no idea what [US] state they are in. I cannotoveremphasize the psychological trauma to these people. What it does to theirfamily members cannot be fully captured either. I have taken calls from seriouslyhysterical family members—incredibly traumatized people—sobbing onthe phone, crying out, “I don’t know where my son or husbandis!”[3]Many detainee transfers are unnecessary and the harmsavoidable. ICE needs a transfer policy with greater clarity of purpose andprotections against abuse. As detailed in the recommendations section below,better transfer standards can be developed with just a few simple reforms.An agency charged with enforcing the laws of the UnitedStates should not need to resort to a chaotic system of moving detainees aroundthe country in order to achieve efficiency. Immigrant detainees should not betreated like so many boxes of goods—shipped to the location where it ismost convenient for ICE to store them. Instead, ICE should hold true to itsmission of enforcing the laws of the United States and allow reasonable andrights-protective checks on its transfer power.The Impact of Transfers on Detainees’ RightsThe current US approach to immigration detainee transfersinterferes with several important detainee rights. To understand the conditionsimmigration detainees face, it is instructive to compare their situation tothat of federal and state prisoners.In the US criminal justice system, pretrial detainees enjoythe right, protected by the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution, to facetrial in the jurisdiction in which their crimes allegedly occurred.[4]Immigrant detainees enjoy no comparable right to face deportation proceedingsin the jurisdiction in which they are alleged to have violated immigration law,and are routinely transferred far away from key witnesses and evidence in theirtrials. In all but rare cases a transfer of a criminal inmate occurs once anindividual has been convicted and sentenced and is no longer in need of directaccess to his attorney during his initial criminal trial. Immigrant detaineescan be transferred away from their attorneys at any point in their immigrationproceedings, and often are. Finally, transferred criminal inmates can usuallybe located through a state or federal prisoner locator system, which isaccessible to the public and in many cases is updated every 24 hours. There isno similar publicly accessible immigrant detainee locator system, meaning thatdetainees can be literally “lost” from their attorneys and familymembers for days or even weeks after being transferred.All immigrant detainees, however, have the right, protectedunder US law as well as human rights law, to be represented in deportation andrelated hearings by the attorney of their choice. Transfers of immigrantdetainees severely disrupt the attorney-client relationship because attorneysare rarely, if ever, informed of their clients’ transfers. Attorneys withdecades of experience told us that they had not once received prior notice fromICE of an impending transfer. ICE often relies on detainees themselves tonotify attorneys, but the transfers arise suddenly and detainees are routinely preventedfrom or are otherwise unable to make the necessary call. As a result, attorneysoften spend days, even weeks tracking down the new location of their clients.Once a transferred client is found, the challenges inherent in conducting legalrepresentation across thousands of miles can completely sever theattorney-client relationship.Even when an attorney is willing to attempt long distancerepresentation, the issue is entirely within the discretion of immigrationjudges, whose varying rules about phone or video appearances can make itimpossible for attorneys to represent their clients. In other cases, detaineesmust struggle to pay for their attorneys to fly to their new locations forcourt dates, or search, usually in vain, for local counsel to represent them.Transfers create such significant obstacles to existing attorney-clientrelationships that ICE’s special advisor, Dora Schriro, recommended inher October 2009 report that detainees who have retained counsel should not betransferred unless there are exigent reasons.Still, immigrants who have already retained an attorney priorto transfer are the most fortunate. Detainees are often transferred hundreds orthousands of miles away from their families and home communities before theyhave been able to secure legal representation. Almost invariably, there arefewer prospects for finding an attorney in the remote locations to which theyare transferred. It is therefore not surprising that in 2008, the most recentyear for which figures are available, 60 percent of non-citizens appeared inimmigration court without counsel.Although most detained non-citizens have the right to a timely“bond hearing”—a hearing examining the lawfulness ofdetention (a right protected under US law as well as human rightslaw)—our research shows that ICE’s policy of transferring detaineeswithout taking into account their scheduled bond hearings often seriouslydelays those hearings. In addition, transferred detainees are often unable toproduce the kinds of witnesses (such as family members or employers) that arenecessary to obtain bond, which means that they usually remain in detention.Once they are transferred, the vast majority of non-citizensmust go forward with their deportation cases in the new, post-transferlocation. Some may ask the court to change venue back to the pre-transferlocation, where evidence, witnesses, and their attorneys are more readilyaccessible. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons discussed in this report,it is very difficult for a non-citizen detainee to win a change of venuemotion.Transfer can also have a devastating impact ondetainees’ ability to defend against deportation, despite their right topresent a defense. Transfer often makes it impossible for non-citizens toproduce evidence or witnesses relevant to their defense. In addition, thetransfer of detainees often literally changes the law that is applied to them.For example, the act of sending a detainee from one jurisdiction to another candetermine whether she may ask an immigration judge to allow her to remain inthe United States.Transfer can pose unique problems for detainees who areminor children, without a parent or custodian to offer them guidance andprotection. ICE is required to send these unaccompanied minors as soon aspossible to a specialist facility run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement(ORR) that is the least restrictive, smallest, and most child-friendly facilityavailable. Placing children in these facilities is a laudable goal, and onethat protects many of their rights as children. Unfortunately, there are veryfew ORR facilities in the United States. Therefore, children are oftentransferred even further than their adult counterparts, away from attorneyswilling to represent them and from communities that might offer them support.The delays and interference with counsel caused by these long-distancetransfers of children can cause them to lose out on important immigrationbenefits available to them only as long as they are minors, such as qualifyingfor Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, which would allow them to remain legallyin the United States.Finally, the transfer of immigrants across long distances toremote locations takes a heavy emotional toll on detainees and their lovedones. Physical separation from family members when immigrants are detained inremote locations impossible for their relatives to reach creates severeemotional and psychological suffering.New Data on Detainee TransfersGiven the serious rights violations that can occur, HumanRights Watch is concerned by the widespread and increasing use of transfers byICE. Data obtained from ICE by Human Rights Watch for this report and analyzedby the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse Universityreveal that transfers have increased sharply in recent years: of the 1.4million transfers that have occurred between 1999 and 2008, more than half (53percent) took place in the last three of those 10 years.The data show a clear link between ICE’s reliance onsubcontractors to house immigrant detainees and the burgeoning number of transfers.The majority of detainees are held in numerous state and local jails andprisons that ICE pays to provide bed space. However, whenever these state andlocal facilities need to free up space for persons accused or convicted ofcrimes, or whenever they decide housing ICE detainees is undesirable forwhatever reason, ICE must move detainees out. As a result, the vast majority oftransfers occur through such subcontracted facilities.Although transfers occur into, out of, and within almostevery state in the country, the three states most likely to receive transfersare Texas, California, and Louisiana. The numbers are so high in each ofLouisiana and Texas that the federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit(which covers Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) is the jurisdiction thatreceives the most transferred detainees. Transfers to states covered by theFifth Circuit are of particular interest to an assessment of the impact ofimmigration transfers because the circuit court is widely known for decisions thatare hostile to the rights of non-citizens and because the states within itsjurisdiction collectively have the lowest ratio of immigration attorneys toimmigration detainees in the country.While it is impossible to determine conclusively based on ourdata whether there is a net inflow of transfers to the Fifth Circuit—andwe certainly do not conclude that it is intentional ICE policy to create suchan inflow—the data show a large disparity between transfers received in(95,114) and originating from (13,031) the Fifth Circuit state of Louisiana. Asdetailed below, a detainee whose deportation hearing might have been about tobe heard in another jurisdiction may well find out, after transfer to afacility within the Fifth Circuit, that his or her chances of successfullyfighting deportation have just evaporated.ICE PolicyAs an agency responsible for the custody and care ofhundreds of thousands of people, it is clear that ICE will need to transferdetainees. The question is whether all or most of the 1.4 million transfersthat have occurred over the past 10 years were truly necessary, especially inlight of how transfers interfere with immigrants’ rights to accesscounsel and to fair immigration procedures.Despite such problems, ICE has remained staunchly opposed tolimiting its transfer power. According to the agency, any such limits wouldcurtail its ability to make the best and most cost-effective use of thedetention beds it has access to across the country. In a time of fiscaldownturn in the United States such efficiency concerns are important, but theyshould never come at the expense of basic human rights. This is especially truefor those detainees who have attorneys to consult, defenses to raise in theirdeportation hearings, and witnesses and evidence to present at trial. Somedetainees may not have such issues at stake. But for those who do, the UnitedStates government and its immigration enforcement agency should not be allowedto act without restraint.Due to changes in ICE leadership under the Obamaadministration, there may be opportunities in the near term for ICE to reduceits increasing reliance on transfers. In August 2009, ICE announced a policyshift tomove away from our present decentralized, jail-orientedapproach to a system wholly designed for and based on ICE’s civildetention authorities. The system will no longer rely primarily on excesscapacity in penal institutions. In the next three to five years, ICE willdesign facilities located and operated for immigration detention purposes.[5]As a part of this plan to create new detention facilitiessolely for immigration purposes, ICE should strive to reduce transfers. Theagency should ensure that the new facilities are under its full operationalcontrol and are located close to the places where the majority of detainees arearrested. Agency regulations should be amended to require that the Notice toAppear (NTA) (the document giving the government’s reasons for believingan immigrant is deportable) is filed with the immigration court closest to thelocation where the detainee is arrested. In addition, new guidelines should beissued by ICE and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) so thatdetainee transfers occur only in instances in which they do not threaten basichuman rights. Once ICE’s transfer guidelines are developed, they shouldbe made a part of US federal regulations so that if the guidelines areviolated, they can be enforced in court. Finally, Congress should considermaking a simple amendment to immigration laws to place a reasonable check onICE’s transfer authority.Transfers do not need to stop entirely in order for ICE torespect detainees’ rights. They merely need to be reduced through theestablishment of enforceable guidelines, regulations, and reasonablelegislative restraints.II.RecommendationsTo place reasonable checks onICE’s transfer authority:The United States Congressshould amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to:Require that the Notice to Appear be filed with theimmigration court nearest to thelocation where the non-citizen is arrested and within 48 hours of his or herarrest, or within 72 hours in exceptional or emergency cases; and/orThe assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Promulgate regulations requiring ICE detentionofficers and trial attorneys to file the Notice to Appear with the immigrationcourt nearest to the location where the non-citizen is arrested and within 48hours of his or her arrest, or within 72 hours in exceptional or emergencycases.Promulgate regulations prohibiting transfer untilafter detainees have had a bond hearing.To reduce transfers ofimmigration detainees:The assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Build new detention facilities or contract for newdetention bed space in locations that are close to where most immigrationarrests occur.Ensure that new detention facilities are underICE’s full operational control, so that the agency is not obliged totransfer detainees from sub-contracted local prisons or jails when the facilityso requests.Require the use of alternatives to detentionwhenever and wherever possible.To address deprivation ofaccess to counsel caused by transfers:The assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Build new detention facilities or contract for newimmigration detention bed space in locations where there is a significantimmigration bar or legal services community.Revise the 2008 Performance Based NationalDetention Standards (PBNDS) to require ICE/Detention and Removal Operations(DRO) to refrain from transferring detainees who are represented by localcounsel, unless ICE/DRO determines that: (1) the transfer is necessary toprovide adequate medical or mental health care to the detainee, (2) thedetainee specifically requests such a transfer, (3) the transfer is necessaryto protect the safety and security of the detainee, detention personnel, orother detainees located in the pre-transfer facility, or (4) the transfer isnecessary to comply with a change of venue ordered by the Executive Office forImmigration Review.Amend the “Detainee Transfer Checklist”appended to the PBNDS to include a list of criteria that ICE/DRO must considerin determining whether a detainee has a preexisting relationship with localcounsel, and require that ICE/DRO record one or more of the four reasonsenumerated above for transfer of a detainee with retained counsel andcommunicate the reason(s) to that counsel.Reinstate the prior transfer standard that requirednotification to counsel “once the detainee is en route to the newdetention location,” and require that all such notifications arecompleted within 24 hours of the time the detainee is placed in transit.Collaborate with the Executive Office forImmigration Review to pilot a project providing low-cost or pro bono legalservices to immigrants held in remote detention facilities.The Executive Officefor Immigration Review should:Issue guidance for immigration judges requiringthem to allow appearances by detainees’ counsel as well as detaineesthemselves via video or telephone whenever a detainee has been transferred awayfrom local counsel, family members, community ties, or other key witnesses.To remedy interference withdetainees’ bond hearings caused bytransfers:The assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Amend the Detainee Transfer Checklist appended tothe PBNDS to include a list of criteria that ICE/DRO must consider in order todetermine whether a detainee has received a bond hearing, or has been foundineligible for such a hearing by an immigration judge, or has consented totransfer without such a hearing.Pursue placement of the detainee in alternative todetention programs prior to transfer.To reduce the interferencewith detainees’ capacity to defend against removal caused by transfers:The assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Revise the PBNDS to require ICE/DRO to refrain fromtransferring detainees who have family members, community ties, or other keywitnesses present in the local area unless ICE/DRO determines that: (1) thetransfer is necessary to provide medical or mental health care to the detainee,(2) the detainee specifically requests such a transfer, (3) the transfer isnecessary to protect the safety and security of the detainee, detentionpersonnel, or other detainees located in the pre-transfer facility, or (4) thetransfer is necessary to comply with a change of venue ordered by the ExecutiveOffice for Immigration Review.Amend the Detainee Transfer Checklist appended tothe PBNDS to include designation of one or more of the four reasons enumeratedabove for transferring detainees away from family members, community ties, orother key witnesses present in the local area.The Executive Officefor Immigration Review should:Issue guidance for immigration judges that stronglydiscourages them from changing venue away from a location where the detaineehas counsel, family members, community ties, or other key witnesses, unless thedetainee so requests or consents, or unless other justifications exist for sucha motion apart from ICE agency convenience. Such guidance should also encouragechanges of venue to locations where detainee family members, community ties, orother key witnesses are located.Issue guidance for immigration judges thatprioritizes in-person testimony, but when such testimony is not possiblerequires judges to allow video or telephonic appearances by family members andother key witnesses. Any decision to disallow these types of appearances shouldbe noted on the record along with the reason for the decision.Issue guidance requiring immigration judgesconsidering change of venue motions to weigh whether a requested change ofvenue would result in a change in law that is unfavorable to the detainee.To ensure that transfer ofdetainees does not interfere with the ability of counsel and family members tolocate and communicate with detainees:The assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Require ICE/DRO to develop a reliable trackingsystem that enables prompt identification of the location where any detainee isbeing held.Require that local ICE field offices maintainup-to-date information about the location of all detainees in their custody andmake that information readily available to family members and attorneys ofdetainees who inquire about the location of a detainee.Revise the PBNDS to provide that if a detainee whohas been transferred is unable to make a telephone call at his or her ownexpense within 12 hours of arrival at the new location, the detainee shall bepermitted a single domestic telephone call at the federal government’s expense.To address interference with counsel and other detrimentallegal outcomes caused by the transfers of unaccompanied minors:The assistant secretaryfor ICE, together with the ORR director, should:Provide age-appropriate ORR facilities for all unaccompaniedminors near to their counsel or in locations where there is access tocounsel, and, in the case of unaccompanied minors who have resided in theUnited States for longer than one year, their former place of residence inthe United States.To improve agencyaccountability and management practices as well as accurate accounting ofoperational costs involved in transfers:The assistant secretaryfor ICE should:Require detention operations personnel to promptlyenter the date of transfer, originating facility, receiving facility, reasonsfor transfer, and counsel notification into the Deportable Alien ControlSystem, or any successor system used by ICE to track the location of detainees.Include costs associated with inter-facilitytransfers of detainees as a category distinct from transfers made to completeremovals from the US in annual financial reporting by the agency.The Executive Office forImmigration Review should:Maintain statistics on the total number of motionsto change venue filed by the government versus those filed by non-citizens, andthe number granted in each category.III.MethodologyThis report is based on 81 interviews conducted by HumanRights Watch with non-citizen detainees in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico;detainees’ family members, immigrants’ rights advocates, andattorneys located throughout the United States; and ICE officials located inWashington, DC, Arizona, and Texas. Human Rights Watch also reviewed 158 pagesof correspondence between ICE and detainees, their family members, and their congressionalrepresentatives, which were produced for Human Rights Watch by ICE in responseto our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.The data on transfers (hereinafter “transfersdataset”) were obtained by Human Rights Watch from ICE on September 29,2008, in response to a request we filed on February 27, 2008, under the Freedomof Information Act.[6]The numbers were analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse atSyracuse University.The files released by ICE contain basic informationconcerning each exit of a detainee from a detention facility during the periodOctober 1, 1998, through mid-April 2008. This information includes thenationality and gender of the detainee, the facility in which he or she had beendetained, the ICE regional hub (known as a “docket control office”or “DCO”), and the dates of entry to and exit from this particularfacility, as well as the date on which the immigrant had first been detained. Acode also identified the exit reason such as “deported” or “removed,”“voluntary departure,” or “transfer.” However, noinformation concerning the reason for a transfer was provided.The first step in TRAC’s research was to develop ananalysis database. Initially, this required processing the 68 separate datafiles that had been released (each containing tens of thousands of records) andcombining them into a single database of 3,376,269 records for furtheranalysis. In addition, supplemental translation databases were prepared to mapeach coded entry to its definition. Consistency checks were also run againstavailable published data. Finally, we checked each record for missing data andfor undefined codes to minimize data entry errors.TRAC also gathered additional information to classify eachof the 1,524 detention facilities that appeared in the data. TRAC hadpreviously obtained information on some of the facilities through separateresearch. For the remaining facilities, TRAC conducted telephone interviews andsought out other publicly available sources identifying the nature of eachfacility. Using this information each of the detention facilities wasclassified into broad categories, including “Service Processing Centers”(ICE owned and operated), “Intergovernmental Service Agreement facilities”(state and local jails under contract with ICE), “private contractdetention facilities,” “federal Bureau of Prisons facilities”(under contract with ICE), “Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities”(under contract with ICE), and “Detention and Removal Operations juvenilefacilities” (ICE owned and operated). Based upon address, each detentionfacility was also classified by state and by the federal court circuit in whichit was located.Additional analysis variables were then added to the database.For example, using the information on recorded dates, TRAC was able to computethe length of stay in a facility (number of days) and the fiscal year in whichthe transfer took place. Using this information along with the reasons adetainee was released from (“exited”) a detention facility, TRACwas able to classify records into those facilities where a detainee was placedon the initial day of detention (“originating” facilities) versusfacilities to which the detainee was later transferred (“receiving”facilities).The data also reveal that often a chain of transfersoccurred. For example, records show that many immigrants were transferred to afacility and then shortly thereafter transferred out of the facility to anotherdetention location. Unfortunately, it was not possible to match the transfersconcerning the same individual because the files for the most part did notidentify the particular detainee involved. As a result, while it was possibleto classify in aggregate the originating and receiving detention facilities, itwas not possible to directly connect the originating and receiving facility onindividual transfers since each record only identified the originatingdetention facility and did not identify the particular facility to which a detaineewas transferred.Once the analysis database was developed, the actualanalysis was carried out in two phases. The focus of the first phase was on thedetainee population and transfer trends. All records where the exit reason wasrecorded as a transfer were included in this phase of the analysis. TRAC firstexamined changes over time in the volume of transfers. Second, TRAC analyzednational origin, gender, and other characteristics of the transferred detaineepopulation and assessed whether there were any significant changes in themake-up of this population over time.The second phase of the analysis focused upon the geographiclocation and other characteristics of the detention facilities, for both theoriginating facility and the receiving facility for the transfer. While it isknown that transfers occur for many reasons, there was no information on why anindividual transfer took place. For example, a transfer may occur to move adetainee close to the deportation location just prior to the detainee’sremoval, or a detention facility may serve only as a convenient stopoverbetween the originating and the intended destination facility. At somelocations, ICE has specialized facilities that play a role in the intakeprocess so that on initial pickup an immigrant may pass through more than onedetention facility as part of the routine intake process.While it would have been desirable to exclude these types oftransfers from the analysis since they were not the focus of the study, therewas no direct way to identify such records because the reason for the transferwas not given. However, it was possible to identify transfers involving“transient” stays—detention facilities in which the immigrantdid not remain overnight. As a partial control, the set of receiving detentionfacilities analyzed in this phase of the research excluded any record where theimmigrant arrived and left on the same day (“zero-day stays”) sincethese types of transfers clearly were outside the focus of this research. Similarly,the set of originating facilities excluded transfers within the same DCO thatinvolved a zero-day stay to reduce double-counting of originating facilitieswhere the intake process during the same day involved multiple facilities.The resulting sets of originating and receiving detentionfacilities were then separately analyzed. For each set, facilities were rankedby the volume of transfers. Counts and rankings for originating and receivingdetention facilities were also developed by type and by geographic location(state as well as federal court circuit).IV. ThePower to Apprehend, Detain, and DeportEvery day non-citizens in the United States are apprehendedby Immigration and Customs Enforcement and placed in a vast network ofdetention centers that, during the most recent year for which figures areavailable (2008), housed 378,582 persons.[7]The majority of these non-citizen detainees are held in about 300 state andlocal jails which, under contract with ICE, receive a daily fee for their bedspace. ICE also detains immigrants in nine service processing centers which itoperates, as well as in six privately-run contract detention facilities, 42contracted juvenile facilities, and two family detention centers.Non-citizens can be apprehended and detained by ICE for avariety of reasons. Many are taken into custody because the legality of theirpresence in the US is disputed and authorities want to hold them pending adecision on their deportation (or “removal”)[8] fromthe United States.[9]Authorities also detain non-citizens arriving in the United States withoutvalid travel or identity documents,[10]including those seeking asylum from persecution, who are detained until theyhave had a “credible fear” interview with an asylum officer.[11] Inpractice, many such asylum seekers are detained even after they have had asuccessful credible fear interview and have applied for parole or release fromdetention under conditions intended to guarantee their appearance at futurehearings.[12]Finally, existing laws require authorities to detain most non-citizens who arefacing deportation after having served a criminal sentence, including those whoare legally in the country (for example, with lawful permanent residentstatus).[13]The power to issue a warrant to apprehend and detain anynon-citizen pending his or her deportation officially rests with the attorney generalof the United States.[14]On a day-to-day basis, that power is exercised by immigration officers. Animmigration officer also may question a non-citizen as to his or her right toremain inside the United States, and may take into custody without a warrantany non-citizen believed to be in violation of any immigration law who is“likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.”[15]Finally, the attorney general may enter into a written agreement with local lawenforcement officials to arrest and detain non-citizens.[16] Inrecent years, there has been a marked increase in these agreements with policeand sheriff’s departments around the country: In 2007, only eight lawenforcement agencies took part in agreements with ICE to enforce immigrationlaws; now a total of 47 agencies in 17 states participate, with 90 more waitingto sign up as of May 2008.[17]Once a non-citizen has been detained, the immigration authoritieshave 48 hours to make a determination as to whether he or she should remain incustody. If the immigration authorities continue to believe that thenon-citizen is present in the United States in violation of immigration laws,they must also decide whether to issue a Notice to Appear in that same 48-hourwindow.[18]The NTA is the document that states the agency’s factual basis forbelieving an individual has violated the immigration laws, and in most cases,why he or she should be removed from the United States. It is the linchpin forany non-citizen wishing to defend against the government’s claim that heor she should be deported from the United States.While the NTA must ordinarily be given to the detaineewithin 48 hours of arrest, that deadline is waived “in the event of anemergency or other extraordinary circumstance in which case a determinationwill be made within an additional reasonable period of time.”[19] Thisextraordinary circumstance loophole was most infamously used by the USgovernment in its treatment of immigrant detainees after the September 11, 2001attacks.[20]It does not appear to be in use today. However, a similar policy remains ineffect due to a memo issued in 2004 by then Undersecretary of Border andTransportation Security Asa Hutchinson, which extended the 48-hour deadline forservice of an NTA to 72 hours in case of emergency, but also stated thatprolonged detention without an NTA is permitted “[w]henever there is acompelling law enforcement need including, but not limited to, an immigrationemergency resulting in the influx of large numbers of detained aliens thatoverwhelms agency resources.”[21]Under this broad guidance, there is no legally enforceabledeadline by which the NTA must be served on the detained immigrant. The lack ofa deadline is illustrated by the “many detainees identified by NGOs andattorneys who are sitting in detention for days, weeks, and sometimes months ata time without having received an NTA.”[22]There is also no deadline for ICE to file the NTA with theimmigration court. This absence of a filing deadline is significant because itis only after this filing occurs that the immigration court has jurisdictionover the case. In other words, it is only after the government files the NTAthat the place or “venue” for the deportation hearings is set.[23] Forexample, if an immigrant is taken into custody in Pennsylvania and held therefor several weeks before an NTA is filed with the immigration court, and thenICE chooses to transfer him to a detention center in Texas and files an NTAthere, his entire legal case has been transferred to Texas.The fact that the government determines where a particularimmigrant’s case will be heard by deciding when and where to file the NTA(for example, waiting until after a transfer has occurred) places a great dealof power in the government’s hands. The power that the government has indetermining venue is significant because sweeping changes to US immigration lawpassed by Congress in 1996 made many more non-citizens subject to deportation,and made it much more difficult for them to defend against their deportation.[24]The United States Congress should amend the immigrationlaws, or ICE should issue regulations requiring the agency to file the NTA withthe immigration court nearest to the place of arrest and within 48 hours oftaking a non-citizen into custody, or within 72 hours in exceptional oremergency cases. These relatively simple legislative or regulatory fixes wouldprovide a measure of necessary control over transfers and enhance fairness inimmigration proceedings.V.Efficient Warehousing: Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Power toTransfer DetaineesThedetermining factor in deciding whether or not to transfer a detainee is whetherthe transfer is required for [ICE’s] operational needs.[25]Immigration Transfers Compared with CriminalTransfersTransfers should be expected in any large,multi-institutional system of incarceration. The fact that they occur in ICEfacilities is not surprising, nor would it be a cause for alarm if reasonablelimits were in place. If the agency worked to emulate best practices ontransfers set by state and federal prison systems, it would reduce the chaosand limit harmful rights abuses. Instead, ICE claims an almost unfettered powerto transfer detainees at will, resulting in a disorderly system of detaineemusical chairs that often violates non-citizens’ rights.While some detainees are held in the ICE facility orcontract facility closest to the place where they are taken into custody, ICEclaims the legal authority to transfer immigrants to detention anywhere in thecountry—from the Dale Correctional Facility in Vermont, to Otero ServiceProcessing Center in New Mexico, and from the Northwest Detention Facility inTacoma, Washington, to the Oakdale Federal Detention Center in Louisiana. ICEclaims that its authority to transfer detained immigrants is contained in section241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states:The Attorney General shall arrange for appropriate placesof detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision on removal. WhenUnited States Government facilities are unavailable or facilities adapted orsuitably located for detention are unavailable for rental, the Attorney Generalmay expend ... amounts necessary to acquire land and to acquire, build,remodel, repair, and operate facilities (including living quarters forimmigration officers if not otherwise available) necessary for detention.[26]This language, which focuses on ICE’s authority toconstruct detention centers (“more of a bricks and mortarorientation”[27]),does not clearly address ICE’s transfer power. Nevertheless, theprovision has been cited by courts as the source of that power, and the interpretationhas gone largely unchallenged.[28]The agency claims that “[t]he INA contains no language limitingICE’s ability to move detainees from one facility to another.”[29]Courts have tended to agree, responding to concerns expressed by detaineesabout long-distance transfers with relative indifference.[30]It is hardly surprising that ICE, believing it has limitlesstransfer powers, pays little attention to a non-citizen’s prior place ofresidence when deciding where to transfer him or her. Former AssistantSecretary Julie Myers repeatedly emphasized that ICE maintains the discretionto detain people wherever there is bed space.[31]As a result, the government reports publicly that “[d]etainees are oftentransferred from one facility to another.”[32]Immigrants are treated like so many boxes of goods—shipped to thewarehouse with the cheapest and largest amount of space available to storethem. One ICE official told Human Rights Watch, “we transfer where bedsare available. It’s out of operational necessity.”[33] Areport released in October 2009 by Dr. Dora Schriro, special advisor on ICE detentionand removal, stated:Although the majority of arrestees are placed in facilitiesin the field office where they are arrested, significant detention shortagesexist in California and the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states. When thisoccurs, arrestees are transferred to areas where there are surplus beds.[34]In discussions with Human Rights Watch, ICE has claimed thatthe frequency of detainee transfers and its inability to limit their use ispartly related to its arrangements with Intergovernmental Service Agreementfacilities (IGSAs), which are state and local jails that contract with ICE tohold detainees. In the case of detainees in the custody of one of thesefacilities, an ICE official told Human Rights Watch,They can pick up the phone and say “I want this guyout of here by the end of the day.” We can’t make the facility keepthe person, so we have to transfer. We don’t transfer as a punitivemeasure, we’re not out to get them ... but when a facility requests it,we have to move the detainee out.[35]Data analysis conducted for this report confirms ICE’sexplanation: the majority of detainee transfers originate from the patchwork oflocal prisons and jails operating under IGSA contracts with ICE. ICE’shaphazard system of placing detainees in a variety of facilities, many of whichit has very little control over, helps to explain why its transfer system isequally haphazard.ICE’s chaotic transfer system stands in markedcontrast to operational standards used in state and federal prison systems.Although immigration detainees are not technically being punished, transfers ofcriminal inmates held in state and federal jails and prisons are more closelyregulated than transfers of immigrant detainees held in ICE facilities.Some of the limits on transfers in the criminal system canbe attributed to the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution,[36]which provides criminal defendants the right to face trial in the jurisdictionin which their crimes are alleged to have occurred. As a result, nearly allcriminal defendants are held near the location of their trial, and cannot betransferred while court proceedings are ongoing. The federal Bureau ofPrisons’ (BOP) inmate transfer protocol makes explicit mention of theneed to coordinate with the federal court system before transfers areimplemented. It contemplates that even after the trial is over, criminaldefendants may need to be “retained at, or transferred to, a place ofconfinement near the place of trial or the court of appeals, for a periodreasonably necessary to permit the defendant to assist in the preparation ofhis or her appeal.”[37]The protocol continues:Ordinarily, complicated jurisdictional or legal problemsshould be resolved before transfer. Ordinarily, the sending Case ManagementCoordinator will determine if an inmate has legal action pending in thedistrict in which confined. If so, the individual should not be transferredwithout prior consultation.[38]Jeanne Woodford, former director of the California Departmentof Corrections and former warden at California’s San Quentin StatePrison, explains that in California’s prison system:During trial, most inmates have court holds on them. Youcannot transfer an inmate who has a court hold on him or her. The prosecutingauthority will come to pick the inmate up for trial.... There should be courtholds in the immigration system. It really is very unfair to start a court casein New Jersey and then transfer the inmate to California.[39]However, there is no system of “court holds” inthe immigration system, and the prosecuting authority—the federalgovernment—is of the view that immigrants can be detained anywhere in theUnited States. In addition, immigrant detainees enjoy no right to facedeportation proceedings in the state or locality in which their immigration lawviolation allegedly occurred. Therefore, as discussed later in this report, immigrantdetainees are routinely transferred far away from their attorneys, keywitnesses, and evidence in their trials.Transfers are common in the criminal context once courtproceedings have ended, but even then, transfers are often regulated by policy.Acceptable reasons for transfers in the federal prison system arise when aparticular inmate needs to be incarcerated at a higher or lower security level,is nearing his or her release date and should be transferred “within 500miles of his or her release residence,”[40]has medical or psychiatric needs that cannot be addressed at the currentinstitution, needs to participate in a program not offered at the currentinstitution, or needs to be sent “temporarily” to another facilityfor security reasons (often caused by overcrowding).[41]Similarly, Jeanne Woodford believes that some transfers inthe criminal system are appropriate and necessary[t]o get people access to facilities that can meet theirneeds—be they mental health, drug treatment, educational, or vocationaltraining. It’s appropriate to transfer people for medical and mentalhealth needs. It’s often too costly to provide for intensive medicalneeds in each and every facility and it is better to address some of theseneeds in one place. Of course, transfers should occur only because the medicaltreatment cannot be accommodated in the original facility.[42]Although access to medical care is one of ICE’s statedrationales for detainee transfers, none of the detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch for this report had been transferred for medical reasons.Similarly, none of the attorneys interviewed for this report recalled everrepresenting a client who had been transferred to meet his or her medicalneeds. Indeed, research by our organization and others has documented seriousproblems with discontinuity in detainees’ medical care due to medicationsand records failing to follow when a detainee is transferred betweenfacilities. ICE sends only a summary of a detainee’s medical records whensending him or her to one of the state and county jails where ICE rents bedspace.[43]Finally, criminal systems track transfers in computerizeddatabases with much more rigor than ICE. For example, the BOP transfer protocolrequires that the reason for transfer and whether or not an inmate is eligiblefor a parole hearing must be entered into the central computer and approved bysuperiors prior to any transfer.[44]Most of the information relating to ICE transfers is not uploaded into acentralized system; it is sent with the detainee in hard copy on a series offorms and files. Moreover, the reasons for transfer or eligibility for bond arenever tracked.[45]In addition, in marked contrast to ICE’s policies, most prison inmatescan be easily located through a state or federal prisoner location system,which is accessible to the public and in many cases is updated every 24 hours.[46]There is no similar publicly accessible immigrant detainee locator systemmanaged by ICE, meaning that detainees can be literally “lost” fromtheir attorneys and family members for days or even weeks after a transfer. Thelack of such a locator system prompted ICE Special Advisor Schriro to recommendin her October 2009 report that “ICE should create and maintain a currentdetainee locator system on the ICE website.”[47]While it is unrealistic for ICE to completely ceasetransferring detainees, implementing procedures and controls on transfers akinto those already in place in the criminal context would go a long way towardprotecting detainees’ rights. Unfortunately, the agency has refused to doanything more than adopt a vaguely worded and unenforceable set of standards togovern its transfer power.ICE’s Internal Transfer StandardsIn 2000, the Immigration and Naturalization Service(ICE’s predecessor) adopted a set of detention standards to provideminimum safeguards for the fair and humane treatment of detainees.[48] Thesestandards were subsequently revised in June 2004[49] andagain by ICE in December 2008 after a lengthy review process that includedinput from nongovernmental organizations.[50]The detention standards are merely internal agency guidelines and do not havethe binding authority of federal regulations or statutory law.Three subsets of those standards are most important from arights perspective: first, the standards on permissible reasons for transfer;second, the standards on when and how detainees are to be informed that theyare being transferred; and third, the standards on when and howdetainees’ attorneys are to be informed that their clients are beingtransferred.The 2004 standards provided a vague set of reasons for whichICE may transfer detainees, including medical needs, change of venue,recreation, security, and “other needs of ICE,” which included“various reasons, such as to eliminate overcrowding or to meet specialdetainee needs, etc.”[51]Nowhere was ICE required to indicate which of these amorphous reasons wasmotivating a particular transfer decision.In addition, when a detainee was being transferred inaccordance with the 2004 standards, he or she was informed only“immediately prior” to leaving the pre-transfer facility and would“normally not be permitted to make or receive any telephone calls.”[52]Finally, the detainee’s attorney was notified of the transfer onlyonce the detainee was “en route” to the new detention facility.[53]Because Human Rights Watch believed these vague standardspermitted human rights violations to occur, we were pleased to learn that ICEand its department of Detention and Removal Operations were reviewing them andwould be issuing a new set of standards in 2008. We brought our concerns to theattention of ICE in a series of letters and through participation in severalin-person meetings with senior ICE officials and colleague organizations.[54]Unfortunately, the revised transfer standards issued in December 2008 werealmost no improvement over the old.Once again, although this time even more explicitly, theagency states that its own operational concerns must dictate the transferdecision: “[t]he determining factor in deciding whether or not totransfer a detainee is whether the transfer is required for operational needs,for example, to eliminate overcrowding.”[55]The standards go on to state that detainees may be transferred after takinginto account security, legal representation, change of venue, and medicalneeds.[56]While operational needs are the “determiningfactor” and therefore override all other considerations, the inclusion oflegal representation as a factor to take into account provides some improvementover the 2004 standards:ICE/DRO will consider whether the detainee is representedby legal counsel. In such cases, ICE/DRO shall consider alternatives totransfer, especially when the detainee is represented by local, legal counseland where immigration court proceedings are ongoing.[57]In addition, the 2008 standards state that “[w]hileICE/DRO transfers detainees from one facility to another for a variety ofreasons, a transfer of a detainee shall never be retaliatory.”[58]With regard to informing detainees of an impending transfer,the 2008 standards are virtually identical to the 2004 standards, stating that a“detainee shall not be informed of the transfer until immediately priorto leaving the facility.” After being informed, “the detainee shallnormally not be permitted to make or receive any telephone calls.”[59]Finally, the 2008 standards provide attorneys even lessnotice of their clients’ transfers than the 2004 standards, stating that“the attorney shall be notified of the transfer once the detainee hasarrived at the new detention location.”[60] Bycontrast, the 2004 standards provided that attorneys should be informed oncetheir client was “en route” to the new location. In reality, thisdistinction has little effect on a detainee’s rights, since in eithercase the attorney has no chance to petition a court to stop the transfer.[61]Not only are the 2008 standards unacceptably vague, they arealso not codified as federal regulations, and cannot be enforced in court. TheDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) has refused to turn the standards intoregulations, saying that the 2008 standards are preferable to enforceableregulations because they provide the “necessary flexibility to enforcestandards that ensure proper conditions of confinement.”[62]VI. New Dataon Frequency and Patterns of Detainee TransfersIn recent years, Human Rights Watch has received numerousanecdotal accounts from immigration attorneys across the country alleging thatICE was transferring immigrant detainees with increasing frequency. However,there were no publicly available data against which we could check theseclaims. Therefore, in February 2008 we submitted a request to ICE under theFreedom of Information Act seeking detailed information about theagency’s transfer practices since 1998. In September 2008 we received aresponse.[63]While the agency did not disclose much of the information we had requested,what it did disclose allowed us to analyze quantitatively what we had heardabout anecdotally for years.Trends in the Frequencies and Types of DetaineeTransferThe data reveal that between 1999 and 2008, ICE made1,397,339 transfers of immigrants between detention facilities. Over those 10 years,the use of transfers has been on the rise, as Table 1 and Figure A show. In2007, 261,941 transfers occurred, more than doubling the number of transfers(122,783) that occurred just four years earlier in 2003. Since the dataproduced by ICE for Human Rights Watch record each transfer movement but arenot linked to individual detainees, and since our qualitative research hasshown that some individual detainees are transferred multiple times, the numberof detainees who have experienced transfer is less than the total number oftransfer movements.Click to expand ImageFigure A: Number of Transfers by Fiscal YearClick to expand ImageSource: See Table 1, above.*Note: Estimate based on transfers continuing at the samevolume for all of fiscal 2008 as was observed until April (179,785). Thisestimate was calculated using a conservative straight-line projection, asopposed to accounting for any exponential growth in transfers.During the 10 years for which we obtained data, the 20nationalities most often transferred are shown in Table 2, below. For any givenyear between 1999 and 2008, these nationalities tended to be the mostfrequently transferred. Table 3 shows the proportional representation for eachof the top 10 nationalities across the 10 years studied.Click to expand ImageTable 3: Trends in Nationality of Transferred Detainees, 1999-2008Nationality1999200020012002200320042005200620072008Mexico41%41%38%41%39%36%35%36%36%40%Guatemala6%7%6%8%9%10%13%14%14%14%Honduras7%7%7%7%9%8%13%15%14%12%El Salvador8%9%8%7%8%8%9%12%15%12%Dominican Republic3%3%3%3%3%3%3%2%2%2%China5%5%4%4%2%3%2%2%1%1%Cuba5%4%5%4%3%3%1%1%1%1%Brazil0%0%1%1%2%5%5%1%2%1%Jamaica3%2%2%2%2%2%1%1%1%1%Colombia1%1%3%2%2%2%1%1%1%1%Source: See Table 1, above.We were interested in whether particular nationalities weretransferred more or less frequently than their proportion of the detainedpopulation would suggest. As illustrated by Table 4, during 2008, nationalsfrom Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras made up larger proportions ofthe transferred detainee population than their proportional time spent indetention would indicate. Mexicans had the largest disparity (8 percent)between their percentage of total transfers and percentage of bed days indetention.Table 4: Nationalities in detention compared with transfers, 2008CountryPercent of total bed days in detentionPercent of total transfersMexico32%40%El Salvador11%12%Guatemala10%14%Honduras10%12%Dominican Republic3%2%China2%1%Brazil2%1%Jamaica2%1%Cuba< 2%1%Colombia< 2%1%Sources: See Table 1; Department of Homeland Security, Officeof Immigration Statistics, “Immigration Enforcement Actions: 2008,”July 2009, http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/enforcement_ar_08.pdf(accessed November 5, 2009), p. 3.As with nationality, the gender of persons transferred alsoremained relatively constant between 1999 and 2008. For any given year, femaledetainees made up between 9 and 11 percent of the persons transferred,averaging 10 percent across the 10 years studied, as shown in Table 5, below.Table 5: Gender of Transferred Detainees,1999-2008Gender1999-2008All1,397,339Male1,254,698Female142,459Unknown182Source: See Table 1, above.Geographic Patterns in Detainee TransfersTo examine the geographic patterns in detainee transfers,records were classified into two groups—those pertaining to detentionfacilities originating transfers and those pertaining to facilities receivingtransfers. Details on the classification process are provided in themethodology section of this report.Limitations in the information ICE released did not permitanalysis of flows of detainees between specific pairs of facilities. This wasbecause while a transfer record showed the detention facility a particulardetainee originated from, it did not identify the facility to which he or shewas transferred. And because the identity of the detainee was not provided, itwas not possible to match up records on the originating and receiving detentionfacilities for a given transfer. In addition, it is known that a significantportion of transfers take place between facilities in the same state. For thesereasons, we cannot assess how many transfers originating in a particular stateactually left that state, nor can we assess how many transfers received in astate began from a location outside of that state.Over the 10 years studied (1999-2008), the following twotables show the states in which detainee transfers originated (Table 6), andthe states that received transferred detainees (Table 7). These tables showthat there is a great deal of transfer traffic originating in and going toArizona, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas. However, Louisiana isfar more likely to receive transferred detainees than it is to originatetransfers, and California, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon are more likely tooriginate transfers than they are to receive transferred detainees.Table 6: States Originating Transfers, 1999-2008StateDetainee Transfers OriginatedRankStateDetainee Transfers OriginatedRankTX168,1061OH5,11428CA153,3202KS4,76429AZ106,4163NE4,62230FL45,5724AR4,00331PA26,0825MN3,11332NY24,2246NM3,00733OR19,5767IN2,72934NJ18,5038WI2,66735NC16,6029SC2,65036IL13,62110OK2,63037LA13,03111RI2,50538VA12,67212MT2,49239CO11,32713SD2,20840TN11,32114NH1,79341GA10,60015VI1,78742WA10,13716CT1,68543MO9,81017ME1,54644MI9,55118VT1,34945UT9,10019AK1,32646PR7,57820WV1,24947KY7,24321WY1,14848MD6,64322ND1,04849MA6,52323MS79950AL6,51724HI53951ID5,97425GU6952NV5,62626DE1053IA5,39427DC554Source: See Table 1, above.Table 7: States Receiving Transfers,1999-2008StateDetainee Transfers ReceivedRankStateDetainee Transfers ReceivedRankTX166,6281ID5,31328CA99,5562IA5,02629LA95,1143NC4,17530AZ85,5514UT3,61931PA43,5985OK2,97432FL42,3196AR2,08233IL29,5057CT2,06234GA25,9298RI1,86935WA17,7149KY1,75736AL16,85810IN95137CO16,56711ME68538VA15,31712MT67339MI14,17313SD53140NY11,51014NH51841NJ9,97515SC48842NM9,92516ND42243OR9,50317NV41344WI9,22318VT24245MD8,57019MS21746MA8,24020AK13647MO8,13421WY5848PR7,72222GU3449TN7,65023WV3150NE7,16924DE2351MN6,97925HI2052KS6,94126DC1653OH5,87027VI354Source: See Table 1 above.Tables 8 and 9 below show that the facility most likely tooriginate transfers is the Florence Staging Facility in Arizona, while thefacility most likely to receive transfers is the Mira Loma Detention Center inCalifornia.

The majority of detainees are held in numerous stateand local jails and prisons that ICE pays to provide bed space under IntergovernmentalService Agreements (IGSAs). Table 10, below, shows that IGSAs originate andreceive by far the most transferred detainees. This finding is not surprisingbecause ICE must move detainees out whenever state and local subcontractors needto free up space for persons accused or convicted of crimes, or whenever theydecide housing ICE detainees is undesirable for whatever reason.Click to expand ImageSince transfers between facilities often occur across largedistances, they can have the effect of altering the law applied to adetainee’s case, which is determined by the federal circuit court ofappeals with jurisdiction over the facility where the detainee is housed. Thefollowing table shows the federal circuits with jurisdiction over the detentioncenters most likely to originate and receive detainee transfers. As Table 11shows, facilities within the Ninth Circuit are the most likely to originatetransfers, although facilities within the Ninth Circuit also receive a verylarge number of transferred detainees. Facilities within the Eleventh Circuitare more likely to receive detainees than they are to originate transfers,while facilities within the Fourth, Sixth, and Second Circuits are more likelyto originate detainee transfers than they are to receive them.Table 11 also shows that detention facilities within the FifthCircuit (a federal circuit known for legal precedent hostile to the rights ofimmigrants)[64]are most likely to receive transfers, although facilities located in the FifthCircuit also originate a large number of transfers. While it is impossible to determineif there is a net inflow of transfers to the Fifth Circuit, our interviews tendto indicate that a number of detainees from other jurisdictions end up there.Moreover, the data show a large disparity between transfers received in (95,114)and originating from (13,031) Louisiana. Therefore, while this report does notconclude that there is an intentional ICE policy of transferring detainees tothe Fifth Circuit, it appears that for at least one of the three states withinthe Fifth Circuit’s jurisdiction, there is a significant inflow of detaineesfrom elsewhere.Click to expand ImageTransfers can also have a serious impact upondetainees’ access to counsel. As Table 12 shows, in many cases detaineesare transferred to circuits with relatively few immigration attorneys. In orderto obtain a rough idea of the number of immigration attorneys in a particularcircuit, we obtained the number of members of the American Immigration LawyersAssociation (AILA) by state.[65]Since not all immigration attorneys are members of AILA, and not every memberof AILA is a practicing immigration attorney, these numbers can only provide arough indication of the distribution of immigration attorneys in the variouscircuits. Table 12 shows that the circuit most likely to receive detainees, theFifth Circuit, has the worst (highest) detainee/attorney ratios; whereas thecircuits least likely to receive detainees—the Second and the DC Circuits—havethe best (lowest) detainee/attorney ratios.Table 12: Transferred Detainee to Immigration Attorney DistributionsCircuitRank by Number of Detainee Transfers Received1999-2008AILA Members as of August 2009Transferred Detainee to AILA Member Ratio5th1934280.4710th5388103.313rd460089.339th2264282.868th743669.5911th3128366.337th663462.596th862946.821st1051636.894th980135.682nd1115079.17DC123210.05Sources: see Tables 1 and 10, above.

As Table 13 illustrates, certainjuvenile detention facilities experience the bulk of transfer traffic: thelargest numbers of juvenile detainees are transferred from and to Hutto[66] andIES in Texas, as well as to and from Southwest Key Juvenile Shelter in Arizona,and Barrett Honor Camp in California.Table 13: Transfer Activity at JuvenileDetention Centers 1999-2008FacilityStateTotal Transfer ActivityHutto CCATX2,722International Emergency Shelter (IES)TX2,242Southwest Key Juvenile FacilityAZ1,975Barrett Honor CampCA1,955Juvenile Facility (Chicago)IL1,374Southwest Key Juvenile FacilityTX1,046BoystownFL932Catholic Charities (Houston)TX569Casa San JuanCA540Berks County Family ShelterPA523Southwest Key Juvenile FacilityCA500Gila County Juvenile Detention CenterAZ419Berks County JuvenilePA400Southwest Key Juvenile Facility (Houston)TX391Los Padrinos Juvenile HallCA385Liberty City Juvenile Detention CenterTX378Southwest Initiatives Group, LLCTX334Southwest Youth VillageIN251Berks County Secured JuvenilePA173Corpus Christi FacilityTX143Southwest Key Juvenile (San Jose)CA129Northern Oregon Juvenile DetentionOR125Alternative HouseTX118All19,358Source: See table 1, above.Costs of TransferICE provides no publicly available analysis of the savings orcosts associated with transfers. It also does not provide information on therationales for transfers in particular cases, which might help the agency andothers to better understand the savings or costs associated with its practices.For example, although none of the detainees interviewed for this report hadbeen transferred for medical reasons, it is certainly the case that somepercentage of transfers are completed in order to provide immigrant detaineeswith necessary medical care, and that providing such care prevents illness,loss of life, and costly lawsuits. However, there is no way to estimate thesesavings since the agency does not make public, or even record in a centralizeddatabase, the reasons for detainee transfers. Even if one accepts the notionthat transfers for medical care provide cost savings to the agency, it is alsotrue that transfers for medical care are not adequately addressing detaineemedical needs: ICE’s failure to care for the medical needs of non-citizendetainees (resulting in deaths in several cases) has been the subject ofnumerous lawsuits, prominent newspaper stories, and congressional action.[67]We have no independent way of estimating the costsassociated with transfers, although we can assume that in addition to the costsof transporting detainees by plane or bus, ICE incurs additional administrativecosts, such as personnel time spent on paperwork or other administrative tasks,costs of additional court time or court delays caused by transfers, costsassociated with unnecessary transfers of persons who are found to be eligiblefor bond and therefore are needlessly detained, or costs associated withduplicative medical screenings or tests.Without better public information on ICE’s operationalbudget related to transfers, it is impossible to conclude whether transfersresult in net costs or savings for the agency. Nevertheless, our research forthis report allows us to conclude that transfers cost certain detainees a greatdeal in the form of human rights violations. The following sections describethese violations.VII. Deprivation of Access to a LawyerThe Importance of an Immigration AttorneyFor any detained non-citizen facing deportation from theUnited States, the importance of legal counsel cannot be overstated. As earlyas 1931, a national commission charged with studying US immigration policyrecognized that in “many cases” a detainee with counsel would beable to prevent a deportation “which would have been an injustice butwhich the alien herself would have been powerless to stop.”[68]Since 1931, immigration law has become only more complex and its proceduresmore difficult for immigrants to navigate without the aid of legal counsel.[69]Nevertheless, as immigration proceedings are civil and not criminal in nature,non-citizens have no right to court-appointed attorneys and must secure legalcounsel at their own expense.Often, it is only an immigration attorney who can tackle thecomplex legal questions relevant to whether a particular immigrant will bedeported from the United States. These questions include, for example, whetheran individual’s criminal conviction fits the definitions of deportableoffenses in immigration law, whether an immigrant is dangerous or a flightrisk, whether the individual has fled persecution in his or her home country,whether a particular non-citizen can marshal enough evidence to prove his“good moral character,” or whether the law on any of these issuesapplies retroactively. These are just a sampling of the numerous issues that immigrationattorneys must address when representing clients facing deportation.In fact, “immigration laws have been termed secondonly to the Internal Revenue Code [tax law] in complexity ... [a] lawyer isoften the only person who could thread the labyrinth.”[70] Addto this the confusion arising from linguistic and cultural differences, as wellas the fear and psychological strain caused by the experience of being arrestedand detained, and the importance of an attorney becomes even more apparent.For its part, the United States government appears at everydeportation hearing represented by a Department of Homeland Security attorney.In the face of such opposition, an immigrant may be unable to adroitly argueher side of the story without the assistance of legal counsel. The importanceof counsel to a non-citizen’s case has been demonstrated forcefully inthe context of refugees seeking asylum in the United States:[W]hether an asylum seeker is represented in court is thesingle most important factor affecting the outcome of her case. Representedasylum seekers were granted asylum at a rate of 45.6%, almost three times ashigh as the 16.3% grant rate for those without legal counsel.[71]The essential relationship between an attorney and animmigrant facing deportation is also protected under human rights law. TheInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a treaty to whichthe United States is party, provides in Article 13 for a non-citizen’sright to defend against deportation and to “be represented for thepurpose before the competent authority or a person or persons especiallydesignated by the competent authority.”[72]US law also provides that immigrants may choose and pay fortheir own attorneys:Right to Counsel—In any removal proceedings before animmigration judge and in any appeal proceedings ... the person concerned shallhave the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the Government) bysuch counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose.[73]Federal regulations make clear that this right to counselapplies to any proceeding in which an examination of the immigrant’s caseoccurs, including a bond hearing, master calendar hearing, merits hearing, andany appeals.[74]Despite the widespread recognition of the importance oflegal counsel during deportation proceedings, as Table 14 illustrates, themajority of immigrants (60 percent in 2008) go through the entire processwithout an attorney.Table 14: Non-Citizens Appearing in Immigration Court without CounselFiscal YearPercent of Non-Citizens Appearing in ImmigrationCourt without Counsel200860%200758%200665%200565%200455%200352%200255%200159% (approximate)200058% (approximate)Source: US Department of Justice, Executive Office forImmigration Review, “Fiscal Year 2008 Statistical Year Book,”Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology, March 2009, p. 5; US Departmentof Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, “Fiscal Year 2007Statistical Year Book,” Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology,April 2008, p. 5; US Department of Justice, Executive Office for ImmigrationReview, “Fiscal Year 2006 Statistical Year Book,” Office ofPlanning, Analysis, and Technology, February 2007, p. 6; US Department ofJustice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, “Fiscal Year 2005Statistical Year Book,” Office of Planning, Analysis, and Technology,February 2006, p. 6; US Department of Justice, Executive Office for ImmigrationReview, “Fiscal Year 2004 Statistical Year Book,” Office ofPlanning and Analysis, March 2005, p. 7; US Department of Justice, ExecutiveOffice for Immigration Review, “Fiscal Year 2003 Statistical Year Book,”Office of Planning and Analysis, April 2004, p. 7; US Department of Justice,Executive Office for Immigration Review, “Fiscal Year 2002 StatisticalYear Book,” Office of Planning and Analysis, April 2003, p. 7; USDepartment of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, “FiscalYear 2001 Statistical Year Book,” Office of Planning and Analysis, March2002, p. 24 (fiscal years 2001 and 2000).Transfers Obstruct Established Attorney-ClientRelationshipsIt’s hugely difficult for the attorney-clientrelationship. You go from a situation where you are able to meet with yourclient to a situation where he is thousands of miles away. We looked intosending one of our lawyers to Texas, just to drop in because he was in themiddle of nowhere. But we never did. It’s difficult to get to.[75]Inherent in the right to representation by counsel is thepractical requirement that ICE keep attorneys informed of the whereabouts oftheir detained clients. Despite the requirement in the detention standards thatattorneys “shall be” notified of detainee transfers, the standardsare not laws; therefore ICE can violate its own standards with relativeimpunity. The non-binding nature of the standards is illustrated by the manyinstances Human Rights Watch documented in which such notifications were eithernot made at all, or not made until several days or weeks after a detainee was“en route to” or “ha[d] arrived at” the new detentionlocation.In nearly every case documented by Human Rights Watch,attorneys learned of the transfers not from ICE, but rather from the detaineeor his family. A March 2009 investigation of ICE’s transfer policiesconducted by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of InspectorGeneral (OIG) confirmed this finding when it stated, “ICE staffinterviewed at the sites visited said they did not notify the detainee’s legalrepresentative because they considered the notifications to be thedetainee’s responsibility.”[76]This belief on the part of ICE staff persisted despite the fact that, as theOIG noted, “ICE is required to notify the representative of record thatthe detainee is being transferred.”[77]The 2009 Schriro Detention Report stated that attorneys: “Report thattheir clients are transferred to locations prohibitively far away, and thatthey are not notified when their clients are moved.”[78]While some detainees do eventually manage to get in contactwith their attorneys after transfer, some are unable to tell their attorneyswhere they are. An attorney in Louisiana told Human Rights Watch that herclient had been transferred “four or five times. When he called me, hedidn’t even know where he was. Turned out he is in New Mexico.”[79]Still others cannot afford to purchase phone cards to let their family orattorneys know of their new location.[80]Another immigration attorney in northern California toldHuman Rights Watch:I have never represented someone who has not been in morethan three detention facilities. Could be El Paso, Texas, a facility inArizona, or they send people to Hawaii. Even after the NTA is filed, thetransfers occur. Some can just do a merry-go-round throughout the time they arein immigration facilities.... I have been practicing immigration law for morethan a decade. Never once have I been notified of transfer. Never.[81]In all cases documented by Human Rights Watch in whichdetainees’ attorneys were not timely notified of transfers, the attorneyhad already filed a notice of representation with ICE (this notice is called a“G-28”) prior to the transfer of his or her client. Therefore,these transfers are also inconsistent with ICE’s stated preference: “weprefer not to transfer anyone with a G-28 on file. But, there is still a needin some cases.”[82]For example, Natalie S., an immigration attorney inPennsylvania, had a G-28 on file for a client who was transferred to WillacyDetention Center in Raymondville, Texas, on March 18, 2008. Two days after thetransfer, the client’s wife called Natalie S. to inform her of thetransfer. At the time of the call, ICE had not yet informed Natalie that herclient had been transferred.[83]In another case Lamar P., an immigration attorney in SanFrancisco, had a G-28 on file for seven months when his client was moved fromdetention in California to Seattle, Washington. His client was transferred onJuly 13, 1998, and counsel was not notified of the transfer until seven dayslater on July 20, 1998.[84]After their clients were transferred, many attorneysreported to Human Rights Watch that they had to resort to calling detentioncenters around the country to try to find their clients.[85] Oneattorney in Chicago explained that she often calls for a regular telephonemeeting with one of her detained clients (for whom she always files G-28forms), only to have to cancel the call when her client cannot be found, atwhich point she begins “calling around to find them.”[86]It is hardly surprising that attorneys are not informed oftransfers given that ICE itself does not always keep track of where it hastransferred detainees, and detainees remain “lost” for weeks ormonths at a time. A 2006 report issued by the Department of HomelandSecurity’s Office of the Inspector General described a transferreddetainee whose new location was not updated for five months: “A detaineefrom CCA [Corrections Corporation of America detention facility in Florence,Arizona][87]was transferred to a Florida detention facility in November 2005. He remainedlisted in DACS [ICE’s computer system] for CCA until April 2006.”[88]Although a more recent DHS OIG investigation noted an improvement inICE’s tracking of detainees, with the agency accurately recording thelocation of 94 percent of detainees in 2009, up from 90 percent in 2006, thosewho were inaccurately recorded remained “lost” for 3.7 days onaverage.[89]Although a delay of several days may seem minor, when anattorney is not notified of a transfer it can have a serious impact on adetainee’s case. Crucial time in which an attorney and client can worktogether in person on preparing evidence or witness lists is lost, andsometimes filing deadlines are missed. Attorneys have no choice but to resignthemselves to the fact that their clients have been transferred and begin tograpple with the challenges inherent in long-distance representation.The logistics involved in representing a transferreddetainee are significant impediments to effective lawyering. Most immigrants indeportation hearings are represented by pro bono attorneys who cannot afford totravel, and telephone communication is simply not adequate for properrepresentation. One commentator explained:Most pro bono attorneys cannot afford to travel to remotedetention facilities to appear at hearings or to meet with clients. Telephoneconversations may also be impossible, because most detention centers have few,if any, telephones, few aliens can afford long distance telephone calls, andaliens and their attorneys often do not speak the same language. Thus, in mostcases, transfer prevents even minimal communication between attorney and clientand effectively prohibits adequate representation.[90]TheLogistical Challenges of Representing a Transferred ClientA pro bono immigration attorneyinterviewed by Human Rights Watch described the challenges she faced inrepresenting her client, a young man seeking asylum who was first detained byICE in a facility for children when he was 17 years old. After reachingadulthood, he was transferred to a relatively convenient adult facilitylocated an hour’s drive away from his attorney’s office inChicago. He was then transferred from that facility to a detention facility360 miles away in Kentucky. The attorney explained:I had a G-28 on file for him as of March 2007. He wasordered removed on December 1, 2008, and was detained at McHenry [a countyjail in Woodstock, Illinois]. Then he was transferred on December 14, 2008. Ididn’t find out where he had been moved until December 23. I tried tocall him at McHenry on December 14, but my conference call was cancelledbecause he wasn’t there. Then I called the four other [ICE] facilities[in Illinois] and found out he wasn’t at any of those facilities.Finally, I emailed ICE headquarters to ask where he was, and in the replyemail they said he was at Boone County, Kentucky! Now that he’s inKentucky, the main problem is that the detainees cannot call out. Withoutcalling cards, they have trouble getting through on the 1-800 number, andthey cannot make collect calls. They can’t fax us from there.... Weneeded him to sign some documents, it took about three weeks for us to getthem signed ... I haven’t gone to Kentucky to see him in person,because given the volume of clients and the distance, there isn’t eventhe possibility of being able to drive.[91]An immigration attorney in northern California describedwhat it was like representing her mentally ill client who had been transferred840 miles away to Arizona. Due to ICE’s failure to follow up on hismedical care, he was not on his prescribed medications and was “talkingto himself, urinating on himself ... and they put him in solitaryconfinement.” Once in solitary confinement, all visits were limited to 30minutes. She explained:His family left California on a Thursday and spent 500bucks to get there, only to have only 30 minutes with him on the Friday....[For his case] we needed his signature, but given his condition, wecouldn’t just send him a letter and ask him to sign it. It was a two-daytrip [for our attorneys] just to get his signature.[92]Another immigration attorney in Chicago explained whathappened when her client was transferred to Texas:I had a G-28 on file. I was not notified that my client wasbeing transferred, and that routinely happens. He was transferred withoutgiving me any notice. I had already established contact with [myclient’s] deportation officer in October 2007. Then I got a call onNovember 15 from my client—he called to let me know they were sending himsomewhere. I called the deportation officer. He didn’t know where he wasgoing so I got in touch with his supervisor, who told me [my client] wasalready gone, and they couldn’t tell me where he was going. I ended upfinding him by process of elimination. I called places all around the county. Iwasn’t told of his whereabouts from ICE. I finally spoke to my client onNovember 20, 2007. He had been sent from Chicago to Texas.[93]As these cases indicate, some immigration attorneys struggleto represent their clients after transfer. However, even this limited form ofrepresentation can continue only if immigration judges allow attorneys toappear for hearings over the telephone or through video conferencing. Oneimmigration attorney acknowledges that the ability to “appear”through such alternative means is a privilege that can be abused byunscrupulous attorneys who prefer not to travel to the immigration courts andwho “will, you know, call in for a hearing from a ball game.”[94]Nevertheless, if the right to counsel is to be respected in immigrationproceedings, video and telephone accommodations must be made by immigrationjudges. This is true despite the fact that in some cases, appearance overtelephone or video is problematic because it is a less effective means ofadvocacy.[95]Human Rights Watch interviewed the sister of a legalpermanent resident detainee facing deportation for a criminal conviction whowas transferred from detention in New York to New Mexico. Many detainedimmigrants in New Mexico have their deportation hearings in El Paso, Texas,which was true for this young man as well. While everyone in the family hadcontributed what they could to pay for a lawyer in Brooklyn, New York, thedetainee’s sister explained that the lawyer was hampered by having to doher work over the phone:My brother had his first hearing over the phone. The judgewas annoyed that she [the attorney] wasn’t there [in Texas]. Hedidn’t allow the lawyer to say much. The case went like the judge hadalready made up his mind. [The attorney’s] voice is a little too soft—sheis very capable of doing this, she’s smart and knows what to do, but thephone? It’s definitely hard for her. That’s why we’re tryingso hard to find the money so she can go down there.[96]Although testimony or legal representation over the phone orvideo is never as persuasive as an in-courtroom appearance, an attorneyappearing through one of these means is better than no attorney at all.Unfortunately, some immigration judges prohibit attorneys from appearing onbehalf of their clients by telephone or video conference. In addition, somejudges simply deny motions to appear telephonically because they are filedafter the standard two-week deadline for filing motions. However, sinceimmigration attorneys are sometimes not informed of their clients’transfers, it may be impossible for them to meet this standard deadline.Judges’ rigid decisions to bar telephonic or video appearances contrastwith the flexibility they could employ, since according to the governmentalbody that sets policies for immigration judges:There are no required or recommended models regarding thelocation of the DHS [government’s] attorney, the respondent’s[non-citizen’s] attorney, and witnesses/family members for video ortelephone conference hearings.... Yes, it is possible for Immigration Judges toconduct an immigration hearing via video or telephone conference in which thejudge, DHS attorney, and respondent are in one location, but therespondent’s attorney, family members, employers, and other witnesses arein a different location.[97]Contrary to this stated flexibility, an immigration attorneyin California described the variety of rigid rules she has encountered in herpractice:In San Antonio, Texas, the judges won’t let a telephonicappearance happen. But in Eloy, Arizona, you’ll never have yourtelephonic appearance denied. For El Centro, California, the judges require youto appear in person for the first hearing [a 600 mile trip from northernCalifornia], but afterwards you can appear telephonically. But if your clientis at Otay Mesa [530 miles from northern California], the judges there do notever allow telephonic appearances. It’s a real nightmare.[98]Transfers do not merely make the ongoing tasks ofmaintaining an attorney-client relationship more difficult. Sometimes, for oneor more of the reasons outlined above, transfers sever the relationshipcompletely. An attorney in El Paso said simply, “it’s a regularoccurrence that people lose their attorney after transfer.”[99] Somedetainees lose their attorneys completely after transfer because of changes inthe law in the new jurisdiction, because logistical challenges make ongoingrepresentation impossible, or because the immigration judges in the newlocation will not allow their attorneys to appear via telephone or video, andthe detainee cannot afford to pay for an attorney to travel to appear in courtin the new location.As one attorney told Human Rights Watch, “it reallysnowballs very fast for families as far as cost is concerned. You can imagine ...[after transfer to Texas] they’re going to have to hire another counsel.It’s a vast amount of money for people who don’t have money tobegin with.”[100]Another attorney told Human Rights Watch,In the cases that we see, ICE ignores the existence ofprior counsel all the time.... The detainee gets transferred out here, andcalls counsel, and all of sudden the counsel has to find someone local or dropthe case.[101]Transferof Detainee Severs Attorney-Client RelationshipJohn M., originally from Ukraine and living lawfully inBoulder, Colorado, since 1994, became subject to removal proceedings in 2007based on a conviction for trespassing and stalking.[102]He retained an attorney in Boulder to represent him. However, on December 21,2007, John M. was transferred 895 miles away to detention in Arizona, andICE’s motion to change venue was granted.John M.’s attorney explained that since telephoneappearances were not allowed by the new immigration judge in Arizona, itwould be “very costly” for him to pay to fly his attorney fromColorado to Arizona for purposes of representation. In addition, his attorneyexplained that he was not as well informed about the applicable law inArizona (Ninth Circuit), since he was used to practicing in the TenthCircuit.For these reasons, John M. lost his attorney. He told Human Rights Watch,“When I came here I lost my lawyer ... so I tried to hire anotherlawyer, but I cannot find anyone here.”[103]Kwan I., who lived lawfully in the US with his wife and twoUS citizen children for 12 years, was arrested by ICE in Philadelphia and putinto deportation proceedings after serving time for driving while impaired. Hespent three days in a detention facility in York, Pennsylvania. His wife wasable to secure an attorney for him there. However, on November 16, 2007 he was“put on a plane and transferred [to Texas]. They did not explain why.They just sent me here.” His attorney in Philadelphia found an attorneyin Texas who was willing to represent him, but, Kwan told Human Rights Watch,“I have not talked to [her] yet. I don’t have money to hire her. Idon’t know what is going on. No one here speaks Korean, so I must use mywife to talk over the phone.” Commenting on the difference it would havemade had he been allowed to remain in Pennsylvania, he said, “Absolutelyit would have made a difference [if they had kept me in Pennsylvania] becauseit takes only two hours to drive between York and [my attorney’s]office.”[104]ARare Case of Reversing TransferIn rare cases, courts have recognized that transfers candeprive non-citizens of the counsel of their choice. Some have ordered thereturn of the individual to the pre-transfer location, or have enjoined theimmigration authorities from engaging in further transfers.[105]An immigration attorney told Human Rights Watch how she eventually managed toget her client, who had been transferred from Chicago to Texas, sent back toChicago after she had filed a motion to re-open his case. She even managed toget the government attorney to join with her in filing the motion to re-open,and venue was set in Chicago, requiring her client to return there fromTexas:It was hard to represent him from a distance. I wasdrafting an affidavit, and it was a lengthy affidavit, so I was fortunatethat my client was kind of savvy. I was relying on him calling. We finallygot his signature after sending it via federal express, and he signed it andreturned it....The key point to me is that the government agreed with methat his case needed to go forward, but even given that, ICE/DRO spent moneyto transfer him. It was a big waste of money for everybody and difficult forhim. No one contacted me about the transfer. By the time I contacted anofficer, they said it was too late. Even when the government signed the jointmotion, they wouldn’t bring him back then, they waited until the judgegranted the motion. The whole thing was just a waste.[106]Court decisions to return transferred detainees are few andfar between because transfers must be shown to be actually prejudicial to theimmigrant’s case before a judge will take remedial action. This is a veryhigh threshold of proof—essentially an exercise in crystal-ball gazing.The immigrant must prove (ironically without access to counsel nearby to aid inmaking the case) that regular access to a lawyer located in the pre-transferlocation would have brought a significantly different result in his deportationcase. Moreover, the 1996 laws put jurisdictional hurdles in place, making it increasinglydifficult for detainees to obtain judicial review of this issue. The vastmajority of cases even considering the issue were decided before 1996, andthese decisions regularly found that a transfer does not impede theattorney-client relationship.[107]It is common for detained non-citizens to never raise the issue and give up ontheir appeals, resulting in their deportation from the United States.As one attorney explained to a Human Rights Watchresearcher:After transfer, detainees lose the certainty [that comesfrom being near their attorneys]. I always speculated that transfer did have aneffect on people and frankly I spent a good chunk of time with [my transferredclient] saying to me, “I just want to quit. I’ll just go back tothe Philippines.” Some transferred people did that, they just droppedtheir cases and said that they were giving up. I’m sure it happens allthe time.[108]Transfers create such significant obstacles to existingattorney-client relationships that ICE Special Advisor Dora Schriro recommendedin her October 2009 report that:Detainees who are represented by counsel should not betransferred outside the area unless there are exigent health or safety reasons,and when this occurs, the attorney should be notified promptly.[109]Interference with Transferred Detainees’Rights to Choose CounselImmigrants are often taken into custody by ICE at a locationnear to their home community where their family members, employers, churchmembers, and other support networks are located. Their detention near to thesesupport networks increases the chances that a detainee will be able to obtainlegal representation in immigration proceedings. Once detainees are transferredto remote locations, they encounter much greater difficulties in obtaining localcounsel. Their families may be able to find a lawyer, but that lawyer is likelyto be located thousands of miles away, and may be unable or unwilling to goforward with representation of a distant client. In this way, the policy oftransfers is inconsistent with non-citizens’ statutory right under US lawto “[be] represented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel,authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose”[110]“Likethe Difference Between Heaven and Earth”As a nine-year-old in 1970, Michael M. entered the USlawfully from Lebanon.[111]His parents are now US citizens, as are his sister, brother, ex-wife, and twochildren. His entire family and his support network, including a sizeableLebanese community, are located in the Los Angeles area.Michael M. was transferred 1,400 miles away to a detentionfacility in Texas after a few weeks in detention in southern California. Hetold Human Rights Watch that the difference for him between being detained inCalifornia and being detained in Texas is “like the difference betweenheaven and earth. At least in California I had a better chance. I could hirea Lebanese attorney to represent me. Now, here, I have no chance other thanwhat the grace of God gives me.”[112]A detainee who lived lawfully in the United States since1990 and was facing deportation because of a drug conviction was transferredafter serving his sentence on Riker’s Island, New York, to Varick StreetDetention Center in New York. From there he was sent to York, Pennsylvania, andfinally he was transferred 2,000 miles away to Otero County Processing Centerin Chaparral, New Mexico. He said, “I can’t really do anything onmy case and I can’t find a lawyer here in New Mexico. Everything would bebetter if I was nearer to my family and a place where I could find anattorney.”[113]Another detainee, who had fled to the US from Guinea toescape female genital mutilation, had been transferred 2,025 miles fromCleveland, Ohio, to Florence, Arizona. She had spent two years in detention atthe time of her interview with Human Rights Watch. She explained that beforeshe could meet with the lawyer her brother had found for her in Cleveland,“They transferred me here [to Arizona]. He couldn’t do anything forme here. I don’t have him anymore.”[114]A detainee from Mexico, who had lived in Los Angeles for 29years, working in construction and manufacturing, with four US citizenchildren, was facing deportation because of a criminal conviction. He wastransferred from Los Angeles to a detention center 435 miles away in Arizona.He told Human Rights Watch, “I tried to call attorneys in California tocome and help me. If I was in Los Angeles, it would be easier to find a lawyer.But, here...? One lawyer in California wanted to charge me $3,000 just for thetrip to Arizona.”[115]An immigration attorney in Arizona said,We have the private contracted prisons here. We have lotsof [ICE] bedspace here in the middle of nowhere. The Florence Project [a smallteam of pro bono immigration attorneys in the state] can only represent a smallnumber of cases. They do the best they can to represent them. But by far,detainees in Arizona have to be prepared to go it alone.[116]In 2007, Christina Fiflis of the American Bar Associationspoke about the paucity of legal counsel for detainees before the Committee onHomeland Security of the US House of Representatives. Remarking on the regularpractice of transferring detainees from the east coast to facilities in Texas,she said:Legal services for indigent immigrant detainees in SouthTexas are scarce, yet 3,200 beds are available for detainees at PIDC [PortIsabel Detention Center] and the Willacy County Processing Center inRaymondville, Texas. Detainees can no longer meet with their attorneys, and thelocal Immigration Judges regularly deny motions by counsel to appeartelephonically for removal hearings. Existing counsel must either find localcounsel to make appearances, travel to South Texas, or withdraw from theirclients’ cases. The service providers in South Texas are only able toserve a fraction of the high volume of detainees in need of assistance whentheir original attorneys are forced to withdraw. These transfers are resultingin a lack of access to counsel for detainees.[117]Corroborating this assessment, another detainee who said hefeared persecution and torture in his home country of Indonesia based on hisChinese ethnicity was transferred to a detention center in Texas that was 1,400miles away from his home community in Los Angeles. He told Human Rights Watch,I could find a lawyer if I was detained in California. Ihave friends and my brother who could help me to find a lawyer. Here in Texas,I sent letters to lawyers to ask them to help me. I thought one had agreed. Butthat lawyer did not come to my final court date. I went to all of them alone.I’ve been in detention for seven months. I give up. I’m not goingto appeal anymore.[118]As the above testimony indicates, detainees not only have aharder time finding an attorney in the places to which they are transferred,many find that after transfer their willingness to defend against removal wanesas they spend increasing amounts of time in detention, far away from family andtheir community of support. As one detainee in Arizona put it, “After a while,some guys just sign for their [voluntary] departure, because they don’thave a lawyer and don’t feel able to fight.”[119]The frequency of detainee transfers is also having achilling effect on whether attorneys are willing to initiate an attorney-clientrelationship at all. Advocates told Human Rights Watch that attorneys areincreasingly reluctant to take on cases from detainees because they can soeasily be transferred across the country.[120]Despite the clear interference transfer creates with adetainee’s ability to be represented by counsel, which is a right underUS statutory and international human rights law, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appealshas concluded that “‘[t]he government simply is not obligated todetain aliens where their ability to obtain representation is thegreatest.’”[121]While one can understand why a court would not insist on the“greatest” possible access to counsel, the right has little meaningwhere the government can regularly and arbitrarily transfer detainees tolocations far from their counsel of choice or locate major detention facilitiesin places where detainees are unable to obtain representation. A middle groundexists between those extremes.VIII. Violation of the Rights to ChallengeDetention and to Fair VenueBond Hearings Delayed or Hindered by Transfers ofDetaineesOnce an individual is detained, he or she has the right torequest what is known as a bond redetermination hearing (or a “bondhearing”) from the immigration judge. This bond hearing, during which thedetainee asks to be released from detention, can go forward irrespective ofwhether the notice to appear has been issued or filed with the immigrationcourt.[122]The three factors used by the immigration court in decidingwhether to grant a bond, and in what amount, are: (1) the non-citizen’sdanger to the community, (2) his or her risk of flight (or likelihood ofappearance for subsequent hearings if released from detention), and (3) whetherthe non-citizen is subject to mandatory detention provisions, which applymostly to non-citizens facing deportation for criminal offenses, or is subjectto other regulations which deprive the immigration judge of jurisdiction.[123] Itis essential that witnesses and evidence relevant to these three factors arepresented at the bond hearing. As one attorney advises fellow immigrationpractitioners:It will [sic] important to document these factors aswell as possible, with evidence of: the non-citizen’s relatives in the USwho have lawful status; non-existent criminal record (or minor crimes);rehabilitation following any criminal activity; a stable place to live; a jobto return to, or a job offer of future employment; eligibility for relief fromremoval (or even voluntary departure), so there is incentive to return to anyhearings, and other relevant information. Have friends and family write lettersof support and appear, if possible, at the bond hearing (possibly to testify,or just to be introduced to the judge).[124]Unfortunately, ICE’s policy of transferring detaineesbefore a bond hearing is even scheduled, as well as transferring them withoutregard to scheduled bond hearings, often seriously delays their access to sucha hearing. In addition, the inability of transferred detainees to producewitnesses or to provide evidence concerning the three relevant factors makes itmuch more difficult for them to prevail at their hearings.When transfers interfere in one or both of these ways withbond hearings, the human right of detainees to a speedy decision on thelawfulness of their detention is threatened. Article 9.4 of the ICCPR states:Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest ordetention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order thatthe court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detentionand order his release if the detention is not lawful.[125]When an immigration judge weighs the factors at issue in abond hearing, the detainee needs to present evidence of ties to the community,such as close family relationships, the possibility of employment, and a stableplace to live. However, transferred detainees cannot present evidence of thesefactors through direct testimony from witnesses. As one detainee who was facingdeportation because of convictions for assault and for buying and selling foodstamps explained,I have everything in America. I have the money for a bond.I can show that I will cooperate. I have been here for 13 years. I own a house.I work in a restaurant ... Since my two crimes, I have obeyed the law verywell. I want to be out because my children need my help. My wife works hard andshe needs me out. I have three children, one girl who is eight, a boy who is six,and our five-year-old daughter with autism. If I could have bond, I could helpthem. If I could have had my [bond] hearing in Pennsylvania before getting senthere [to Texas], I would have been out long ago.[126]In addition, since one of the factors weighed in bondhearings is the dangerousness of the individual, if the non-citizen is facingdeportation because of a criminal conviction, the victim of the crime can oftenbe a very persuasive witness. Victims of relatively minor crimes committed bynon-citizens are often willing to testify. In some cases, their desire forjustice already has been satisfied by the individual spending some time inprison or paying a fine. In other cases, victims are relatives who turned intheir non-citizen family member for minor crimes.[127] Insome of these cases, victims are shocked to learn that, as a result of theirholding the non-citizen relative accountable for a minor crime, he or she isfacing permanent banishment from the United States.As one attorney said, “for bond hearings, whenever youcan, and it happens often since some crimes are relatively minor, you want thevictim to testify to disprove the dangerousness.”[128]However, after transfer to a remote detention center, it is extremely unlikelythat the victim will be able to travel to the new location in order to testify,thereby making it unlikely that the detainee will obtain bond.TransferJust Prior to Bond HearingThomas P., a legal permanent resident originally fromJamaica, was placed in removal proceedings in Pennsylvania due to hisconviction for drug possession.[129]According to his attorney, some individuals in Pennsylvania with similarconvictions had been granted bond in the past. Several aspects ofThomas’s application, including the lack of violence in his crime, aswell as his longstanding employment and residence in the community and closefamily relationships, would have weighed against his dangerousness and flightrisk and in favor of granting him bond. Thomas had lived in Pennsylvania withhis wife in a home which they owned and had worked for the same employer for20 years. His attorney filed a motion for a bond hearing and the hearing wasscheduled for March 20, 2008, by the York immigration court. Two days priorto his hearing, Thomas P. was transferred 1,816 miles away to WillacyDetention Center in Texas. His bond hearing was rescheduled in Texas forApril 28, 2008. His attorney appeared by telephone, and he was not able tohave his wife, two sons, two daughters, or employer present at the hearing.His bond was denied.[130]As the case above demonstrates, ICE sometimes decides totransfer a detainee just before a bond hearing is to be held. While we have noevidence showing that ICE intends to interfere with bond hearings, frequentinterference occurs because ICE does not check whether such a hearing hasoccurred and is not required to check under existing transfer policies. Animmigration attorney in El Paso explained that he often saw detaineestransferred to New Mexico or Texas just before their scheduled bond hearings invarious east coast detention locations:On a regular basis, transfers down here interfere withpeople’s ability to obtain bond. In some cases, people are transferredbefore they can have their bond hearing. Then, once they’re down here,they’re likely to be denied. We’ve also had cases where people aregiven a bond in city A and before the family can even post the bond in city A,they are transferred to El Paso—and then find that their bond iscancelled by the immigration judge down here. Getting transferred down heremeans little chance of getting bond.[131]In another example, the mother of a young man living in LongBeach, New York, wrote her congressman to express her concern that her son wastransferred from a detention facility in New Jersey to New Mexico on the sameday as his bond hearing.On the day of his trial a U.S. Marshall [sic] informed himthey were transferring him to New Mexico. Despite him telling them he was duein court that very morning they still transferred him.... We have not seen himin almost two months.[132]Of course, many transferred detainees interviewed by HumanRights Watch did not even know that they had the right to apply for bond. Manydid not have attorneys to advise them of this right. Many of those who somehowlearned of the opportunity to apply for bond faced an uphill battle proving,without ready access to witnesses and evidence, that they met the requisitecriteria.Transferred Detainees are Rarely Able to ChangeVenueICE’s decision to transfer a detainee is a step ofimmense significance. Even if a detainee has spent all of her time living inthe United States within a particular state, and even if her deportation is dueto a previous violation of the criminal laws of that state, if a detainee istransferred before the NTA has been filed with the immigration court, she canexpect to have her entire case proceed in the new post-transfer state, subjectto the law as interpreted by the US Court of Appeals that hears casesoriginating from that state.If this occurs, detainees and their lawyers may attempt tochange venue back to the original pre-transfer location. However, it is verydifficult for a detainee to win a change of venue motion (as discussed below,it appears to be less difficult for government attorneys). In order to changethe venue for a deportation case, the judge must find “good cause.”Good cause is understood to require the balancing of several factors, some thattip the scales in favor of the US government, and some that tend to favor thedetainee. Judges typically weigh:Administrative convenience; expeditious treatment of thecase; location of witnesses; cost of transporting witnesses or evidence to anew location; and factors commonly associated with the alien’s place ofresidence.[133]While these factors on their face may appear balanced,detainees and their attorneys confront particular challenges when presenting achange of venue motion, since “the mere fact that an applicant allegedlyresides ... in another city, without a showing of other significant factorsassociated with such residence, is insufficient.”[134]Moreover, the power rests entirely with the immigration judge, who may base hisor her decision on evidence of administrative convenience and/or expeditioustreatment of the case alone (both of which are factors weighing againstchanging venue for a transferred detainee):Change of venue is committed to the sound discretion of theimmigration judge and will not be overturned except for an abuse of discretion.An immigration judge commits an abuse of discretion only if there is noevidence to support the decision or if the decision is based on animproper understanding of the law.[135]Moreover, courts have consistently held that the location ofa detainee’s attorney (often the same location as the detainee’switnesses and former place of residence) is insufficient cause for change of venue.[136]Finally, judges have not been required to weigh whether a non-citizen will besubject to a less favorable legal standard in the new venue, which can bedecisive.[137]In cases in which ICE chooses to transfer a detainee afterthe NTA is filed with the immigration court, the agency consistently files amotion to change the venue to the new, post-transfer jurisdiction. Often,especially when a detainee is unrepresented, he or she may not understand thesignificance of the change of venue motion filed by the DHS attorney, andtherefore may passively agree to the case proceeding in the new jurisdiction.One immigration attorney in Arizona reported to Human Rights Watch thattransferred detainees were pressured to sign statements of non-opposition tochange of venue motions, or did not fully understand the motions beforeagreeing not to oppose them.[138]When detainees are the ones requesting change of venue, manyjudges seem to take a view similar to the one articulated by a judge in Seattlewho, during a hearing, said to the attorney for a transferred detainee:I don’t normally grant motions for a change of venue[filed by a detainee].... Because he is in detention being held by the INS[ICE’s predecessor], I cannot tell the INS to transfer to anotherdistrict....[139]A court reviewing this and other statements by the Seattleimmigration judge (“IJ”) noted, disapproving of the IJ’sconduct, “the IJ advised counsel that it was her practice to deny motionsfor change of venue for detained aliens unless the INS agreed.”[140]Interviews with immigration attorneys support the idea thatchange of venue motions filed on behalf of transferred detainees are rarelywon. One attorney represented a mentally ill Cuban asylum seeker, whose fatherwas a key witness in the case and due to age and disability, could not travelfrom Los Angeles to Eloy, Arizona, where his son was detained. The attorneyexplained to Human Rights Watch,This case was my first successful change of venue motion inmore than a decade of practice. We filed a phone book [a large number ofdocuments] to get this guy’s venue changed.[141]A detainee in Texas, who had spent one month in detention inPennsylvania near to his Pittsburgh attorney, his US citizen wife, and his 15-month-oldUS citizen daughter, filed a change of venue motion after his transfer toTexas. He told Human Rights WatchThe judge [in Texas] asked me “where is yourlawyer?” and I told her that she was in Pennsylvania. Also, all mydocuments, my daughter’s birth certificate, the police records.... everythingwas there. But, I filed the change of venue motion and it was denied.[142]An attorney in Texas explained that the US government“opposes everything. So, when you file a change of venue motion,you’re going to get a boilerplate opposition from the [DHS]counsel’s office.” This same attorney described one unusual case inwhich he had been successful in changing venue:We filed a change of venue motion giving a witness list foreight or so people in San Antonio. It was hard to convince this client to keepfighting. He was so depressed, and he just wanted to take voluntary departure.But, the judge heard our motion and said “I recognize that all thesewitnesses have to appear, I recognize that this guy’s moral character isgoing to be very much in issue, I will grant the change of venue.”[143]While not every detainee, especially those who areunrepresented, knows to file a change of venue motion, every detaineeinterviewed by Human Rights Watch in Texas who had managed to file such amotion was denied.[144]Due to our concerns about ICE’s common practice oftransferring detainees and subsequently filing change of venue motions oropposing motions filed by detainees, Human Rights Watch asked the ExecutiveOffice for Immigration Review to give us statistics on the number of change ofvenue motions filed by detainees and subsequently granted by immigrationcourts, as well as the number filed by the government of the United States andsubsequently granted by the courts. In its response, EOIR claimed that it hadno data responsive to our questions, and specifically did not track change ofvenue motions based on whether the request was filed by the DHS attorney or thenon-citizen detainee.[145]The difficulties transferred detainees face in changingvenue raise concerns that the US is violating its obligation under Article 14of the ICCPR to ensure “everyone ... a fair and public hearing by acompetent, independent and impartial tribunal.” Impartiality is at riskif one litigant (such as the DHS) is invariably more successful in its attemptsto change venue. In addition, the scales of justice are not well balanced whendetainees are systematically prevented from vigorously presenting their casesand presenting all necessary evidence due to venue considerations. Moreover,fairness is under threat if judges do not consider whether a change of venuemotion will result in the detainee being subjected to less favorable law (asubject discussed in detail in Chapter X), affecting his or her interest inremaining in the United States. Of course, neither detainees nor DHS attorneysshould be empowered to shop around for the most favorable forum through changeof venue motions, which is why impartiality in deciding these motions isessential.IX.Violation of the Right to Defend Against DeportationThoughdeportation is not technically a criminal proceeding, it visits a greathardship on the individual and deprives him of the right to stay and live andwork in this land of freedom. That deportation is a penalty—at times amost serious one—cannot be doubted. Meticulous care must be exercisedlest the procedure by which he is deprived of that liberty not meet theessential standard of fairness.[146]Despite the US Supreme Court’s 1945 admonition aboutthe need for meticulous care in deportation proceedings, transfers of detaineesoften interfere with their ability to present a defense, which in turnundermines the fairness of the entire procedure. The detrimental effects oftransfer on a detainee’s ability to present a defense were emphasizedtime and again during our interviews with immigration attorneys for thisreport.[147]Detainees themselves were also deeply frustrated by the negative effecttransfer was having on their deportation cases.There are several ways in which transfer can impede adetainee’s defense. Immigration detainees often rely on family members,friends, and their relationships in churches and communities of origin todefend against deportation. The existence and strength of such relationshipsare one of the few bases in US law for a non-citizen to argue that he or sheshould not be deported. For example, in many cases in which the detainee canapply to cancel his or her deportation, the detainee’s spouse, parent,and/or child is a critical witness to establish that deportation would resultin what the law defines as “exceptional and extremely unusualhardship.”[148]Human Rights Watch interviewed a 61-year-old man from Mexicowho came to the United States in November 1979. His immigration status andconviction would allow him to apply for “cancellation of removal”based on hardship to his legal permanent resident wife, four US citizenchildren, one of whom was gravely ill with a spinal injury, and 16 US citizengrandchildren. Nevertheless, he was struggling to present evidence of theserelationships to the judge in Texas, since his family members were all insouthern California and unable to travel to Texas.[149]In other cases, a detainee may be able to defend againstdeportation based on a close family member’s status as a US citizen, orbased on the resolution of a pending application to adjust his or her ownstatus to one that would not result in deportation. Other detainees can defendagainst deportation by proving that they themselves are US citizens. In any ofthese scenarios, the detainee’s spouse, parent, and/or child is acritical witness in establishing the required family relationship. Proximity toone’s family may be the only way to gather the necessary evidence todefend against deportation.For example, the US citizen stepfather of a young man facingdeportation wrote to his congressman, begging him to stop his detainedstepson’s transfer from Boston to Louisiana. The stepfather claimed hisstepson was a US citizen due to the US citizenship of his biological father.The stepfather was honorably discharged from the US army in 1992, after seeingcombat in the 1991 Gulf War and serving in Saudi Arabia and Germany. InGermany, he met and married his wife, and became stepfather to her thentwo-year-old son. He wrote to explain:[T]here is even a chance that [name redacted] would bemoved to a facility as far away as Louisiana.... I am asking your office forhelp in keeping [name redacted] in a Boston area facility, and for help inslowing down the process that would have [name redacted] deported and wouldbreak up our family. We need time to establish the fact to the US Governmentthat [name redacted] is actually a US citizen, due to the US citizen status ofhis biological father.[150]In asylum cases, detainees’ family members cansometimes provide the best evidence of the persecution their loved one mightface if deported. For example, an Indonesian detainee of ethnic Chinesebackground told Human Rights Watch he was trying to claim asylum because of thepersecution he and his siblings had faced in Indonesia. He was originallydetained in Los Angeles, but was transferred to Texas where he was having avery difficult time getting evidence from his family and other sources aboutthe persecution he had experienced and feared in the future:The judge says she doesn’t know if what I am sayingis true. The only document I have is a copy of my birth certificate. The peoplewho can prove it are in California. I signed up as a dorm cleaner so I could ...buy a phone card. I saved up so I could try calling my brother and sisters [inLos Angeles], but I cannot get a hold of them.... I don’t even know ifthey know where I am.... If I was in California, it would be easier. I couldget the information I need from my brother. I could find a lawyer. I’vebeen in detention now for seven months. It’s getting more stressful. Ithink I’m just not going to appeal anymore. What else can I do?[151]In still other cases, a detainee’s moral character isrelevant to whether the court will find he or she must be deported. Toestablish moral character, employers, family members, community witnesses, andeven victims of the detainee’s minor criminal offense can provideessential evidence.For example, Esteban G. entered the United States from ElSalvador as a refugee when he was 17 years old. His mother, sister, andstepfather are all US citizens and all reside in California. Esteban was takeninto custody in Los Angeles, but “before my Mom and sister could getthere to visit me” he was transferred to detention in Texas. He wasfacing deportation because of a drug possession conviction, for which he hadbeen sentenced to probation. He told Human Rights Watch how difficult it hasbeen for him to defend against his deportation, both because his documents werelost during the transfer and because his moral character is an issue in hiscase:First of all, they didn’t send me all my property andpapers, which I need for my case. It’s been three months since theytransferred me from LA and I still don’t have my papers. I have filedfive requests to get them. The officer said, “if you keep bothering me,the more time it will take.” They say they are deporting me for“trafficking,” but that is not what I was doing. My conviction isfor possession of $20 of cocaine and $5 of marijuana. I have people in LosAngeles who can talk about my character, who know that I worked hard, went tohigh school, was always there for my family. I messed up when I got involvedwith the drugs. But trafficking? That’s not what I was convicted of—butwhere are my papers to prove it? Plus, the judge here says that the witnessescan’t go to court in LA and testify.[152]As this case illustrates, there are also practical ways inwhich transfers can interfere with detainees’ ability to present adefense. In some cases, detainees lose access to law libraries after beingtransferred to contract county jails.[153]In others, detainees lose their legal documents during the transfer process.[154]Finally, family members and friends often provide the critical link betweendetainees and immigration counsel by helping detainees locate and retaincounsel, as well as by assisting in collecting supporting documents anddeclarations. Transferred detainees in remote locations cannot get such help.A legal permanent resident from the Dominican Republic detainedin Texas who was facing deportation because of a domestic violence convictionexplained that his entire family is in Pennsylvania, as are all of hisdocuments. He told Human Rights Watch, “I had to call to try to get thepolice records myself. It took a lot of time. The judge got mad that I keptasking for more time. But eventually they arrived. I tried to put on the casemyself. I lost.”[155]The lack of proximity to relevant documents is an enormoushurdle for non-citizens transferred far away from the state in which theyreceived their criminal conviction. This is becausethe government frequently files criminal deportationcharges against aliens without providing the proper court records to prove theconviction, and the IJ’s enter orders of deportation anyway—so thealien often has to obtain his own certified conviction and police records todisprove the government’s allegations.[156]There are numerous federal court cases noting that thegovernment sometimes fails to submit sufficient evidence in support of itsclaim that a particular non-citizen is deportable.[157]Therefore, a transferred detainee’s inability to obtain necessarydocuments from a jurisdiction far away from his or her place of post-transferdetention, even without a strong case against him or her, can have devastatingresults in his or her case.In another example, a detainee transferred from southernCalifornia to Texas wrote to then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales:I have no legal representation because I cannot afford one.Judge Rogers declined to release me on bond and remarked when I asked, that hewould not grant a request to transfer venue to Riverside, California. Alladditional evidentiary documents or witnesses for my defense would be there....California has been my home of record for most of my life. I do not pose a riskof flight—all family and relatives are residents of California. I do notpose a danger to anyone.[158]Transferring detainees away from key witnesses and evidenceeffectively denies them an opportunity to present a defense against removal,which is a violation of their human rights. Article 13 of the ICCPR states:An alien lawfully in the territory of a State Party to thepresent Covenant may be expelled therefrom only in pursuance of a decisionreached in accordance with law and shall, except where compelling reasons ofnational security otherwise require, be allowed to submit the reasonsagainst his expulsion and to have his case reviewed by, and be representedfor the purpose before, the competent authority or a person or personsespecially designated by the competent authority.[159]The UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors statecompliance with the ICCPR, has interpreted the phrase “lawfully in theterritory” to include non-citizens who wish to challenge the validity ofthe removal order against them. In addition, the committee has made thisclarifying statement: “if the legality of an alien’s entry or stayis in dispute, any decision on this point leading to his expulsion ordeportation ought to be taken in accordance with article 13.... An alien mustbe given full facilities for pursuing his remedy against expulsion so that thisright will in all the circumstances of his case be an effective one.”[160]Despite the principle that the ability to present evidencein one’s favor is essential to a fair hearing and despite the many waysin which detaining non-citizens near to their families and communities oforigin facilitates access to such evidence, there is no requirement that ICEstaff weigh whether a detainee has family and community relationships nearbywhen making a transfer decision. Therefore, detainees are routinely transferredto remote locations where travel costs or immigration judges’ refusals toallow video or telephonic appearances prevent the presentation of testimonialevidence essential to the defense against removal.Despite the serious problems transfer can cause fordetainees as they try to present their defenses, US courts have been decidedlyunsympathetic to these concerns. As one court states:The INS affords detainees the right to present witnessesand evidence at their removal proceedings, but it does not afford detainees themeans for getting those witnesses or evidence to the hearings. The fact thatLouisiana may be inconvenient for the Petitioner’s witnesses [located inConnecticut] is insufficient to establish the prejudice required to prevent atransfer.[161]X. UnfairTreatment before the CourtsItis obviously repugnant to one’s sense of justice that the judgment metedout ... should depend in large part on a purely fortuitous circumstance....[162]Deportation, though not technically recognized under US lawas a form of punishment, is a coercive exercise of state power that can cause aperson to lose her ability to live with close family members in a country shemay reasonably view as “home.” Most deportees are barred, eitherfor decades or in many cases for the rest of their lives, from ever reenteringthe United States. Similarly, the decision to grant an individual asylum frompersecution is a matter of tremendous significance, even of life and death. Giventhe serious interests at stake, human rights law requires that the decision todeport or to grant asylum be based on procedures that are scrupulously fair.Unfortunately, the haphazard system of detainee transfers undermines thefairness of immigration proceedings because the law applied to detainees’cases is often changed midstream.Not only are these changes in applicable law contrary to fundamentalnotions of fairness, they may also contravene international standards on equaltreatment under the law. In important ways, immigrants facing removal are akinto persons accused of crimes in the United States. While immigrants facingremoval are not technically in criminal proceedings, the penalties they face,detention and deportation, are severe infringements on their liberty—muchlike criminal defendants who face prison time as punishment. In addition, manyimmigrants are facing deportation because they violated a particularstate’s criminal laws. However, unlike criminal defendants who normallycannot be transferred until their trial is complete, immigrants are routinelytransferred away from the jurisdiction in which they were arrested and theapplicable law literally changes beneath their feet.Transferred immigrants are disadvantaged and denied equaltreatment as compared with most criminal defendants in the United States. Onmultiple occasions documented by Human Rights Watch, ICE’s decision totransfer a detainee away from the jurisdiction of his or her arrest hasresulted in the application of substantive legal standards that aresignificantly less beneficial to the alien’s application for relief fromdeportation than the law would have been had the alien not been transferred.Whenever a detainee is transferred between two of the 12federal circuit courts of appeals, and his or her removal hearings take placein the new circuit, he or she will have that circuit’s interpretation offederal laws applied to his or her case.[163]Since the federal circuit courts of appeals vary in their interpretations ofcriminal offenses, the transfer of a detainee can affect the way the court willinterpret whether the criminal offense he is being deported for is an“aggravated felony.” This is a very important issue fornon-citizens facing deportation, because if their convictions are considered“aggravated felonies” under immigration law, they will be placedinto summary deportation procedures. In these summary procedures, a non-citizencannot ask a judge to consider canceling his deportation even if he can showthat his crime was relatively minor or his connections to the United States(such as family relationships) are strong. If a detainee is transferred to thejurisdiction of a court that considers his criminal conviction (for which hehas already served his criminal punishment) an aggravated felony, there is verylittle he can do to defend against his banishment from the United States.Imagine a non-citizen who has lived as a lawful permanentresident in Detroit, Michigan, and who has two misdemeanor convictions underMichigan law for simple possession of marijuana. After paying his fines orserving his criminal sentence, and assuming he is detained by ICE in Michiganand his deportation hearings proceed there, his two misdemeanor offenses wouldnot be considered aggravated felonies. In other words, they would not beconsidered serious enough to bar him from asking the immigration judge to allowhim to remain in the United States.[164]However, if ICE decided to transfer him to detention inTexas or Louisiana, a likely outcome as this report has demonstrated, the lawapplied to his situation would be completely different. In these post-transferlocations, his two state misdemeanor convictions would be considered aggravatedfelonies and would bar him from being able to ask the judge to cancel hisremoval.[165]Transfers between other parts of the country would bring similar results, basedon differing interpretations of what constitutes an aggravated felony. Such anoutcome rarely affects persons accused of violating federal and state criminallaws, whose trials nearly all take place in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred.TransferLeads to Deportation after 22 Years of Legal ResidenceJeffrey J., a lawful permanent resident, was interviewedby Human Rights Watch in Texas.[166]He was arrested and detained by ICE in New York, where his two crimes of drugpossession did not constitute an aggravated felony.[167]Based on his legal permanent resident status, 22 years of legal residency,and strong family relationships in the US, he would have been eligible forcancellation of removal in New York.After three months of detention in New York and NewJersey, however, he was transferred to Texas, where the immigration judgeinterpreted applicable Fifth Circuit law to bar his claim to relief fromremoval. The Board of Immigration Appeals declined to reverse that ruling andJeffrey was deported from the United States. In a subsequent phone call toHuman Rights Watch from Jamaica, Jeffrey spoke of his “sadness anddepression,” not knowing anyone in Jamaica, and missing his home andfamily in the United States.[168]The case of Rafael S., who was interviewed by Human RightsWatch in detention in Texas, illustrates this problem. Rafael was arrested anddetained by ICE in California, where he retained an immigration attorney duringthe two weeks he was detained there.[169]Under applicable law in the Ninth Circuit, Rafael’s second offense fordrug possession, in which he was neither charged nor convicted as a recidivist,would not constitute an aggravated felony.[170]As a result, based on his legal permanent resident status, 10 years of lawfulresidence, and strong family relationships in the US, he would be eligible forcancellation of removal. Nevertheless, he was transferred to Texas, where underapplicable Fifth Circuit law, his second drug possession offense is likely tobe interpreted to constitute an aggravated felony and thereby bar him fromapplying for cancellation of removal.[171]This same issue arises with detainees’ eligibility to changetheir immigration status to one that will exempt them from deportation based ontheir close family relationships inside the United States. The Fifth Circuit Courtof Appeals has determined that detainees in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana maynot change their immigration status in this way if they have certain types ofcriminal convictions.[172]If these same immigrants are detained in the Ninth or Tenth Circuits, suchconvictions are not determinative.[173]In still other cases, a non-citizen may have accepted a pleabargain in his or her criminal case in reliance on that jurisdiction’sinterpretation of the conviction as a non-deportable offense. Later, if thissame individual is transferred to a jurisdiction where his or her guilty plearenders him or her deportable—an occurrence that he or she obviouslycould not have foreseen at the time of the plea—he or she may haveserious regrets about his or her decision not to fight the case.Finally, the Fifth Circuit holds to the view that even if anon-citizen’s criminal conviction has been subsequently vacated (meaningthat the criminal court has rendered the conviction void based on procedural orsubstantive errors at trial), it is still considered a “conviction”for the purposes of immigration law. This means that an immigrant who wasconvicted of a crime in Illinois, for example, but whose conviction was vacatedbecause of errors at trial, if transferred to detention in Texas would still besubject to deportation based on that conviction.[174]Transfers AffectAbility of Refugees to Receive AsylumRefugees (defined as non-citizens with a well-founded fearof persecution based on one of the grounds enumerated in the Refugee Convention)are entitled to apply for and be granted asylum in the United States.[175]Whether or not a particular non-citizen is granted asylum inthe United States often involves fundamental questions of life and death.However, because so many asylum seekers in the United States are subject tomandatory detention (at least 16,000 new asylum seekers were detained duringeach of 2002 and 2003),[176]they are often transferred between detention centers throughout the UnitedStates and subject to the vagaries of different interpretations of the lawbased on where they are transferred.A statistical study published in the Stanford Law Reviewin November 2007 revealed striking differences in the propensities of each ofthe circuit courts to reconsider (or “remand”) the asylumapplications of individuals from 15 countries of origin, who had beenunsuccessful in having refugee status recognized at the lower levels of theprocess. The study’s authors excluded countries whose nationals wereusually not granted asylum in the lower levels of the asylum process. Eight ofthe eleven circuits that hear asylum appeals had rates of remand that werebetween 8 percent and 31 percent. But the Fourth, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuitsall had remand rates under 5 percent. As noted previously, of these three circuitswith very low remand rates, the Fifth Circuit receives the largest number oftransferred detainees, and the Eleventh Circuit receives the third largestnumber. In each case, some of the transferred detainees are refugees seekingasylum, and yet by accident of transfer they have ended up in the circuitsleast likely to require lower courts to take a second look at their asylumapplications. As the authors of the Stanford study recognized,[A]ll of these circuits are applying the same nationalasylum law, and it seems odd to us that the rights of refugees seeking asylumin the United States should turn significantly on the region of the UnitedStates in which they happen to file their applications.[177]Substantive interpretations of asylum law also vary bycircuit. Human Rights Watch interviewed a woman in Arizona who had been livingin Ohio prior to her arrest and detention. She explained that she had beenforced to undergo female genital mutilation and several years later fled hernative Guinea when she became the mother of a girl whom she wanted to protectfrom undergoing this same procedure. Had she been detained and put intodeportation procedures in Ohio, where Sixth Circuit law applied, this womanwould have had a strong chance of being granted asylum.[178] Ifshe had been detained and undergone deportation procedures in the neighboring SeventhCircuit, she most likely would have had her claims denied.[179]However, she was transferred to detention in the Ninth Circuit in Arizona whereit was possible, though not as likely as had she remained at home in Ohio, thatthe court would look favorably on her case.[180]In yet another example, an asylum seeker who was detained inthe Fifth Circuit was denied asylum even though she had been arrested andrepeatedly raped while in prison in her home country. She had been arrestedafter the president was assassinated in the building in which she worked as agovernment employee but the Fifth Circuit did not find the rapes to have occurred“on account of” her political opinion or her membership in thesocial group of government employees, since she could always “change heremployment”; and refrained from considering whether the rapes constitutedtorture.[181]However, if this same asylum seeker had been detained in Pennsylvania, in the ThirdCircuit, her rape and imprisonment would have been recognized as persecutionand torture, and she likely would have been granted asylum and allowed toremain in the United States.[182]Another area of asylum law that is especially problematicfor transferred detainees relates to whether or not courts will allow them tomake a claim for asylum after the one-year filing deadline set in immigrationlaw. US immigration law allows an asylum seeker to apply after the one-yeardeadline only after showing “extraordinary or changedcircumstances.”[183]However, the rejection of a claim of “extraordinary or changedcircumstances” has been interpreted by some courts as a discretionarydecision by the immigration agency or attorney general that no court is able toreview or reverse.[184]The inability to appeal the agency’s decision overwhether changed circumstances should allow for an extension of the one-yeardeadline means that many transferred detainees will be denied the opportunityeven to apply for asylum. For example, an Egyptian woman applied for asylumbecause she had received a threat from Islamist extremists after her attendanceat a women’s rights rally, which occurred after the one-year deadline.Since she was applying for asylum in California, she was able to appeal certainaspects of the immigration judge’s decision that the new threat did nottrigger the “changed circumstances” exception to the one-yearfiling deadline.[185]Had she been transferred to Illinois, New Mexico, or Pennsylvania, she wouldnot have been able to make that appeal.[186]XI. The Emotional Toll of Family SeparationThetransfers are devastating—absolutely devastating. [The detainees] areloaded onto a plane in the middle of the night. They have no idea where theyare, no idea what [US] state they are in. I cannot overemphasize thepsychological trauma to these people. What it does to their family memberscannot be fully captured either. I have taken calls from seriously hystericalfamily members—incredibly traumatized people—sobbing on the phone,crying out, “I don’t know where my son or husband is!”[187]The detrimental effects of detainee transfers go beyondinterference with the right to counsel and to fair and equal treatment beforethe courts. Since detainees are often transferred far away from their familymembers and communities of support inside the United States, their detentiontakes an enormous emotional and psychological toll. As described above, ICEdoes not inform family members about transfers, so relatives often undergo agreat deal of stress until detainees can find a way to inform them of their newlocation. As one attorney said, “It’s scary for them, because thefacilities just tell the families that [their relative has] been released. Thefacilities have no idea where they have gone, so neither do thefamilies.”[188]A clinical psychologist who treatedimmigration detainees in Arizona spoke with a Human Rights Watch researcherabout the psychological effects transfers can have on detainees: “We’retalking about completely isolating people from anything that would be helpfulto them.”[189]Because they often come from families with such little income, even phone callsare seen as a major expense and are rare.[190]The psychologist continued, “these people are already in a desperateplace, and they are being separated from anyone who can be any kind of supportto them.”One 22-year-old Chinese detainee told Human Rights Watchthat his transfer from detention in California to Texas had separated him fromhis mother, causing them both significant distress. She had been able to makethe trip to Texas once during his five months in detention. Reflecting on thatvisit in a subsequent interview with Human Rights Watch, he said, “I madeher hair turn from black to grey, and now it’s white.”[191]Minor children and their parents often suffer acutely whenthey are separated by transfer, especially when the detained parent is sent toa location so far away that regular visits become impossible. As one detainee whowas transferred from New York to New Mexico said, “Every time I manage tocall, my two little girls are crying by the time we get off the phone. Ican’t take it.”[192]A spouse of a detainee wrote:I am an American Born Citizen married to [name redacted]for 23 years with five children, one of which is currently serving our countryin Kuwait. My husband is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania which is 750miles away from Georgia where I am living.... I beg you to please help mychildren and I during this hardship. We have a 9 & 10 year old that arepaying the consequences. They really need to be a part of their father’slife ... if there is anything you can do to try to help us bring [nameredacted] to a closer distance we would greatly appreciate it.[193]An attorney spoke about how difficult it is for detainedmothers to be separated from their children after transfer:It seems to me that there are so many unique issues with[detained] women. It’s a higher psychological toll to be separated fromtheir children. It gets to the point where you cannot even communicate withyour client at all [because they are so distraught]. With men, there’sdefinitely an impact, but with women it takes over their entire being. Anybodywho works with women detainees who have been transferred away from childrenwill tell you it’s so much more emotionally taxing for them.[194]TransferDevastates Mother Separated from Young SonA clinical psychologist spoke to Human Rights Watch aboutan African woman who had been abused and tortured in her country of originand who had also undergone female genital mutilation. After this abuse,according to the psychologist, she had developed severe post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD). However, after immigrating to the US, “she turned herlife around:” she had married and had a young son, and trained andultimately became a nurse.[195]While working in the hospital, however, she assaultedsomeone. The psychologist’s assessment was that an incident in thehospital triggered her PTSD just before the assault. While she was able toserve her criminal sentence in California in a prison near to her husband andyoung child who visited her regularly, she was subsequently detained by ICEand transferred.As the psychologist explained:Once ICE took her into custody she was immediately sentto detention in Florence, Arizona. There was no possible way for her husbandand her young son to get to see her there. That was where I tried to workwith her. It was terribly heart-wrenching for her to be detained so far awayfrom her small child. She spent almost a year in detention fighting herdeportation. During that time, she never saw her son, who lost a year of lifewith his mom from age four to age five. It was devastating for the entirefamily.[196]Several attorneys reported to Human Rights Watch that thetransfers of detainees away from family members wore down the detainees’willingness to spend the time in detention necessary to pursue appeals of theircases. Eventually, many signed voluntary departure agreements.[197] Asone attorney put it:The primary impact of transfers is on the individual andtheir families. It’s just so devastating financially and emotionally. Somany family members have told me that it’s like their [detained] relativeis dead. As the length of time in detention goes on, everyone loses hope. Thereis an attrition rate in visits, and family just cannot keep up with the delaysin the cases. They manage to get there for the first go-around, when they weresupposed to be there, but then the government appeals, or there is acontinuance, and it’s tough to keep coming back. What happens to the kidsis the real tragedy.[198]The sister of a detainee who was transferred from New Yorkto New Mexico told Human Rights Watch:Ever since they sent him there, it’s been anightmare. My mother has blood pressure problems, and her pressure goes up anddown like crazy now, because of worrying about him and stuff. [His wife] hasbeen terrified. She cries every night. And his baby asks for him, asks for“Papa.” He kisses his photo. He starts crying as soon as he hearshis father’s voice on the phone even though he is only one.... Last week[my brother] called to say he can’t do it anymore. He’s going tosign the paper agreeing to his deportation.[199]Another attorney in Arizona said:Number one thing is that their families can’t visitthem.... It plays a big part in the morale of the detainee. It has to play withyour mind. One of the thoughts that goes through everybody’s head is“why don’t I just leave and take the deportation?” Thetelephone is the other part of it ... their phone calls are subject tomonitoring, and the calls cost so much from detention. It costs too much,especially when it is the breadwinner who is in detention.[200]An attorney representing an individual from India, whoexplained that his client had been tortured prior to seeking asylum frompersecution in the United States, spoke with Human Rights Watch just days afterhis client had been transferred away from his family in northern California todetention in Hawaii. The attorney explained:What we see is that our client is emotionally devastated[by the separation from his family]. He is showing his willingness to drop hiscase. This is someone who doesn’t want to be sent to a place where he fearspersecution and he wants to drop his case in the Ninth Circuit because hecannot bear the separation from his wife and children.[201]This same detainee’s wife wrote to ICE:I was born in 1971, and was married to [name redacted] on November21, 2001. We have two US-born children. My husband has been in the custody ofthe ICE. I have recently learned that he has been transferred [to Hawaii fromnorthern California]. This will cause unusual and undue hardship to me and myfamily. I am very attached to my husband and so are our children. We want to beable to see him as often as possible. Especially our six-year-old daughter hasbeen visiting him on almost a weekly basis. We request that he would betransferred to a facility nearby....[202]In our research, we did not come across a single case inwhich ICE had granted such a request.[203]XII.Unaccompanied MinorsTransfers are uniquely problematic in the case ofnon-citizens who are unaccompanied minors. An unaccompanied minor is someonebelow the age of 18 who enters the United States without parents or other legalcustodians able to provide him or her with protection and assistance. Sincethese children are undocumented, they are subject to deportation and most aredetained while they await the outcome of their deportation or asylum hearings.The United States policy of detaining unaccompanied minors, particularly thosewho are seeking asylum, contravenes established international standards on thecare and treatment of children.[204]For decades Human Rights Watch has focused on the rights abuses that occur whenchildren are detained far away from their communities of origin. As early as1998 we recommended that the INS work to house non-citizen children near totheir communities of origin, legal services, and support.[205]Under current operational guidelines, when ICE firstapprehends an unaccompanied minor, ICE is required to send him or her as soonas possible to a specialist facility run by the Office of Refugee Resettlementthat is the least restrictive, smallest, and most child-friendly facilityavailable. Therefore, as soon as ICE becomes aware that it has an unaccompaniedminor in its custody, the agency “calls ORR and they tell them where thenearest open bed is, and that’s where the child goes.”[206]The Office of Refugee Resettlement maintains 43 facilitiesfor the detention of unaccompanied minor children throughout the United States.The limited number of facilities combined with the increasing number ofunaccompanied minors placed in detention (approximately 10,350 in 2007)[207] hasexacerbated problems caused by transfers. This is because unaccompaniedchildren are often placed in facilities that are even further away from theirsupport networks than are adult detainees, since there are so few facilitiesavailable to accommodate children.[208]The effects of transfer upon children are really stories ofunintended consequences, since the laudable goal of placing children in theleast restrictive and most child-friendly facilities has motivated the policyof housing children in facilities run by ORR. Nevertheless, these placementsoften separate children from pro bono attorneys willing to help them orextended family members who might be able to provide some support. They mayalso alter the law that will be applied in their deportation cases. Accordingto one expert specializing in this area, “What might be best for thechild may not be [the] best thing for their case. We are faced with terriblechoices. Transfer of children to ORR facilities often just puts people in untenablesituations.”[209]Zhen Ching Shui, a Chinese citizen, was put on a boat by hisparents while he was a teenager because he had been threatened withsterilization by China’s birth planning department.[210]Zhen was 17 years old when he reached where his uncle lived in Guam. Since hedid not possess a valid entry document, he was placed in detention in afacility for unaccompanied minors in Phoenix, Arizona. Although Zhen’suncle retained an attorney for him in Guam, the lawyer experienced difficultiesin representing his client because of the distance between them. Zhen filed amotion to change venue to Guam, but it was denied. As a reviewing courtexplained,Even had the immigration judge granted Zhen’s motionto change venue for the removal proceedings to Guam, Zhen would have remainedin physical custody in Arizona.... The original reason for Zhen’stransfer to Phoenix was the lack of a juvenile detention facility on Guam.[211]An expert working with children in ORR facilities explainedto Human Rights Watch how unaccompanied children can sometimes be transferredover and over again throughout the system, especially if they begin exhibitingbehavioral problems that ironically may be exacerbated by detention itself.According to this expert, the more restrictive facilities are often the onesthat break down a child’s willingness to fight against his or herdeportation:Many of these children are highly traumatized even beforethey get here. Lots of nightmares, lots of behavioral problems—thatredoubles on itself because when they have behavioral problems they gettransferred to increasingly secure systems, [such as a secure facility inIndiana].... For the kids in Indiana, the facility was very restrictive and thecourt was a five-hour bus ride each way. Oh my god, some of the kids detainedthere would say “just send me home if you’re going to keep me likethis.” The kids just give up. They just give up. These are kids who arecoming from places where they are highly likely to be harmed if they go back,but they give up anyway.[212]In another case documented by Human Rights Watch, a17-year-old boy, Ramon M., was eligible for special immigrant juvenile status(SIJS), a classification that allows certain unaccompanied minors to remain inthe United States.[213]Ramon had counsel representing him and an ability to prove dependency forfoster care purposes in Arizona. However, he was transferred 1,660 miles awayto the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village, an ORR facility in Vincennes,Indiana. ICE filed a motion for change of venue, which was opposed byRamon’s counsel but granted by the immigration judge. Once venue waschanged, it was impossible for Ramon to prove dependency under the state lawsof Indiana without accruing six months of residency in Indiana. This timerequirement caused Ramon to “age out” of eligibility for specialimmigrant juvenile status, which meant he lost the ability to remain lawfullyin the United States.[214]Corroborating this example, the same expert working in ORRfacilities told Human Rights Watch that children’s legal cases often arenegatively affected by transfers between distant juvenile detention facilities:Sometimes the transfers can affect the client’sability to qualify for SIJS. Sometimes the court isn’t informed that thechild has been moved and they show up as a failure to appear. By the time thatsomeone can concentrate on the case, it’s too late for them to apply forSIJS [because they have aged out], or to ameliorate [sic] the failure to appearruling. It’s really so sad. A lot of times whether a child’s casewas developed enough to see if they really had a chance to stay in the UnitedStates depends on whether the [pro bono attorneys] near to him or her werereally overwhelmed. You might have a kid where the lawyers can do something forthem, but then they get moved to a place where the lawyers are totallyoverwhelmed. They don’t stay long enough in one place to get the helpthey need.[215]AcknowledgmentsThis report was researched and written by Alison Parker,deputy director of the US program of Human Rights Watch.

For securitypurposes, the attorney shall not be notified of the transfer until the detaineeis en route to the new detention location.” Ibid., p. 2.[54]Human Rights Watch meeting with various ICE officials, May 2008; letters toAssistant Secretary Julie Myers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, June 24,2008, and October 16, 2008 (letters on file with Human Rights Watch); HumanRights Watch meeting with NGO colleagues and various ICE officials, September2008. We note that other colleague organizations also raised similar concerns.Letter to Assistant Secretary Julie Myers from American Civil Liberties Union,comments on the draft ICE/DRO Performance-Based Detention Standards, February22, 2008.[55]US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Operations Manual ICE PerformanceBased National Detention Standards,” part 7, chapter 41, http://www.ice.gov/doclib/PBNDS/pdf/transfer_of_detainees.pdf,p. 2.[56]The additional factors to be taken into account are, in full: “Inaddition, a specific detainee may be transferred to meet the specialized needsof the detainee. In making the determination as to whether to transfer adetainee, ICE/DRO will take into account: Security. A detainee may betransferred to a higher-level facility because of circumstances that cannotadequately be controlled through the use of segregation housing. Such securityreasons might include, for example: When the detainee becomes a threat to thesecurity of the facility; When the detainee is violent or has caused a majordisturbance or is threatening to cause one; or When a detainee’s behavioror other circumstances present a threat to the safety of staff or otherdetainees. Legal Representation. ICE/DRO will consider whether the detainee isrepresented by legal counsel. In such cases, ICE/DRO shall consideralternatives to transfer, especially when the detainee is represented by local,legal counsel and where immigration court proceedings are ongoing. Medical. TheDivision of Immigration Health Services (DIHS) may recommend that a detainee inneed of specialized or long-term medical care be transferred to a facility thatcan better meet those needs. The DIHS Medical Director or designee must approvetransfers for medical reasons in advance. Medical transfers shall becoordinated through the local ICE/DRO office of jurisdiction using establishedprocedures. Change of Venue. A detainee may be transferred from onejurisdiction to another to accommodate a change in venue by the ExecutiveOffice for Immigration Review (EOIR).” Ibid.[57]Ibid.[58]Ibid.[59]“The detainee shall not be informed of the transfer until immediatelyprior to leaving the facility, at which time he or she shall be notified thathe or she is being moved to a new facility within the United States and notbeing removed…. Following notification, the detainee shall normally notbe permitted to make or receive any telephone calls or have contact with anydetainee in the general population until the detainee reaches the detentionfacility.” Ibid., p. 3.[60]Ibid. (emphasis added).The full standard states: “When a detainee isrepresented by legal counsel, and a form G-28 has been properly executed andfiled…. The attorney shall be notified of the transfer once the detaineehas arrived at the new detention location. Generally, notification will be madeas soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours after the transfer. Whenthere are special security concerns, the Deportation Officer may delay thenotification, but only for the period of time justified by thoseconcerns.”[61]In fact, even if counsel has enough time to protest a client’s transfer,many courts have interpreted the immigration laws to strip the courts of powerto review any decision to transfer a detainee. Van Dinh v. Reno, 197 F.3d 427, 434 (10th Cir. 1999). Courts are particularly unable toreview transfer decisions if these occur before the NTA is filed. US law grantsjurisdiction to federal courts over removal proceedings, and removalproceedings do not commence until the NTA is filed, so any actions prior to thefiling of the NTA (such as transfer or the timing of when to file the NTA) aregenerally seen as unreviewable. Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, 291 F.3d594, 599 (9th Cir. 2002) (“We construe § 1252(g), whichremoves our jurisdiction over ‘decision[s] ... to commenceproceedings’ to include not only a decision in an individual case whetherto commence, but also when to commence, a proceeding”); Richards-Diazv. Fasano, 233 F.3d 1160, 1165 (9th Cir. 2000) (“We are in noposition to review the timing of the Attorney General’s decision to‘commence proceedings.’”).[62]Letter from Jane Holl Lute, deputy secretary of the Department of HomelandSecurity, to Michael Wishnie and Paromita Shah, July 24, 2009, http://www.nationalimmigrationproject.org/DHS%20denial%20-%207-09.pdf(accessed November 4, 2009) (denying the “Petition for Rulemaking toPromulgate Regulations Governing Detention Standards for ImmigrationDetainees.”).[63]See Appendix for Human Rights Watch’s original request to ICE and itsresponse.[64]The Fifth Circuit’s interpretations of immigration law are discussed inmore detail in Chapter X. There we point out, for example, that the circuit hasruled that two or more misdemeanor convictions qualify as aggravated felonies,and therefore bar non-citizens from applying for cancellation of removal (seenote 165 and accompanying text). The circuit also has one of the lowest ratesof remand for asylum claims, a subject that is also discussed in Chapter X.[65]Email from Jennifer English Lynch, director of Membership, American ImmigrationLawyers Association, Washington, DC, to Human Rights Watch, August 31, 2009(email on file with Human Rights Watch).[66]We note that ICE announced in August 2009 that it will no longer house detainedimmigrant families at the Hutto facility, which will presumably reduce thenumber of juvenile detainees transferred there.
