Found guilty ofone count of criminal sexual conduct,[1] Jacob was placed on Michigan’s sex offenderregistry and prevented by residency restriction laws from living near otherchildren.This posed a problem for his family—Jacob’s parents were separated, his father lived in Florida, and Jacob couldnot live in the same house as his little sister. As a result, he was placed ina juvenile home. When Jacob was 14—and still unable to return home—hebecame the foster child of a pastor and his wife. According to Jacob, thecouple helped him to “deal with the trauma” of growing up on theregistry.Since his offense fell underjuvenile court jurisdiction, Jacob was placed on a non-public registry. Butthat changed when he turned 18 during his senior year in high school, and hisstatus as a sex offender became public. Parents of his schoolmates tried to gethim expelled and he had to “fight to walk across the stage” atgraduation. Jacob attended a local university in Big Rapids, Michigan, butended up dropping out. “[I was] harassed for being on the registry,”he said. “The campus police followed me everywhere.”In February 2005, at age 18,Jacob left Michigan to start a new life in Florida and reconnect with hisfather living there. Jacob worked for his father’s company for a fewmonths. He soon fell in love, married,and had a daughter. A year later, he and his wife divorced, and Jacob wasawarded joint custody of his daughter. During this time, Jacob tried to followFlorida’s sex offender laws, but continually ran afoul of residencyrestrictions that required him to check-in with police on a daily basis andprovide them with a home address. At one point, for example, Jacob’s homewas too close to a school and he had to move. Another time, he failed toregister a new address after a period of homelessness and was arrested andconvicted of the felony of failure to register.While court documentsdescribe Jacob as a doting parent to his daughter, Jacob’s wife cameunder investigation by Florida’s Department of Children’s Servicesin 2009 for not having electricity in the house. However, when the court inthat case learned of Jacob’s felony conviction for failure to register,the judge denied him custody of his daughter, citing Florida’s KeepingChildren Safe Act and the fact that Jacob had a criminal felony conviction forfailure to register. Jacob continues to fight for custody and visitation butcannot afford a lawyer because he has been unable to find a job. Now age 26, Jacob wasremoved from the registry in Michigan in 2011, but remains on the registry inFlorida, and his life continues to be defined by an offense he committed at age11.***Jacob’s story is notunique. Throughout the United States, people who commit sex offenses aschildren (also referred to in this report as “youth sex offenders”)must comply with a complex array of legal requirements that apply to all sexoffenders, regardless of age.Upon release from juveniledetention or prison, youth sex offenders are subject to registration lawsthat require them to disclose continually updated information including acurrent photograph, height, weight, age, current address, school attendance,and place of employment. Registrants must periodically update this informationso that it remains current in each jurisdiction in which they reside, work, orattend school. Often, the requirement to register lasts for decades and even alifetime. Although the details about some youth offenders prosecuted injuvenile courts are disclosed only to law enforcement, most states providethese details to the public, often over the Internet, because of communitynotification laws. Residency restriction laws impose another layer of control, subjecting people convicted of sexual offenses as children to a range of rules about where they may live. Failure to adhere toregistration, community notification, or residency restriction laws can lead toa felony conviction for failure to register, with lasting consequences for ayoung person’s life.This report challenges theview that registration laws and related restrictions are an appropriateresponse to sex offenses committed by children.Even acknowledging the considerable harm that youth offenders can cause, theserequirements operate as, in effect, continued punishment of the offender. Whilethe law does not formally recognize registration as a punishment, Jacob’s case and those of many otheryouth sex offenders detailed below illustrate the often devastating impact ithas on the youth offenders and their families. And contrary to common publicperceptions, the empirical evidence suggests that putting youth offenders onregistries does not advance community safety—including because it overburdens law enforcement with large numbers ofpeople to monitor, undifferentiated by their dangerousness.Human Rights Watch undertookthis investigation because we believe the time is right to better understandwhat it means to be a youth offender raised on the registry. Sex offender lawsthat trigger registration requirements for children began proliferating in theUnited States during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They subject youthoffenders to registration for crimes ranging from public nudity and touchinganother child’s genitalia over clothing to very serious violent crimeslike rape. Since some of these state laws have been in place for nearly twodecades, and the federal law on sex offender registration is coming up on itseighth anniversary, their effects have been reverberating for years.A Policy Based on a MisconceptionSexual assault is asignificant problem in the United States and takes a huge toll on survivors,including children. According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), there werean estimated 125,910 rapes and sexual assaults in 2009 (the most recent yearfor which data is available). In an estimated 24,930 of these cases, thevictims were between the ages of 12 and 19. The DOJ study did not examine howmany of these incidents involved an adult or youth offender. Thus, we do notknow how many were similar to the vast majority of the cases investigated forthis report—that is, cases of sexual offenses committed by childrenagainst another child. Nevertheless, the public and lawmakers haveunderstandable concern, even understandable outrage, about sex crimes. Sexoffender registration laws have been put in place to respond to those concerns.The overlapping systems ofsex offender registration, community notification, and residency restrictionswere initially designed to help police monitor the “usual suspects”;in other words, to capture the names and addresses of previously convictedadult sex offenders on a list, which could be referred to whenever a newoffense was committed. In theory, this was a well-intentioned method to protectchildren and communities from further instances of sexual assault.In reality, however, thispolicy was based on a misconception: that those found guilty of a sex offenseare likely to commit new sex offenses. Available research indicates that sexoffenders, and particularly people who commit sex offenses as children, areamong the least likely to reoffend.Available research indicates thatsex offenders, and particularly people who commit sex offenses as children,are among the least likely to reoffend.In 2011, the nationalrecidivism rate for all offenses (non-sexual and sexual combined) was 40percent, whereas the rate was 13 percent for adult sex offenders.Several studies—including one studyof a cohort that included 77 percent youth convicted of violent sexoffenses—have found a recidivism rate for youth sex offenders of betweenfour and ten percent, and one study in 2010 found the rate to be as low as onepercent. These rates are so low that they do not differ significantly from thesex crime rates found among many other (and much larger) groups of children, oreven the general public.A 2006 study ofapproximately 250 Philadelphia youth sex offenders stated, “[s]exoffending as a juvenile does almost nothing to assist in predicting adultsexual offending.” The study concludes that if the goal of registrationis to identify likely future sex offenders, it would be more effective toregister youth with five or more contacts with law enforcement for non-sexualoffenses than to register youth found guilty or delinquent of a sex offense.Long-Term Impact on YouthSex Offenders and Their FamiliesWhen first adopted,registration laws neither required nor prohibited inclusion of youth sexoffenders. However, by the mid-1990s, many state sex offender registration lawswere amended to include children adjudicated delinquent of sex offenses, aswell as children tried and convicted of sex offenses in adult court. Theresulting policies swept children into a system created to regulate thepost-conviction lives of adult sex offenders.Children accused of sexualoffenses were caught at the convergence of two increasingly harsh “toughon crime” policy agendas: one targeting youth accused of violent crimesand the other targeting persons convicted of sexual offenses. In an effort toprotect children from sexual assault and hold sex offenders accountable,lawmakers failed to consider that some of the sex offenders they were subjectingto registration were themselves children, in need of policy responses tailoredto their specific needs and circumstances.The harm befalling youth sexoffenders can be severe. Youth sex offenders on the registry experience severepsychological harm. They are stigmatized, isolated, often depressed. Manyconsider suicide, and some succeed. They and their families have experiencedharassment and physical violence. They are sometimes shot at, beaten, even murdered;many are repeatedly threatened with violence. Some young people have to postsigns stating “sex offender lives here” in the windows of theirhomes; others have to carry drivers’ licenses with “sexoffender” printed on them in bright orange capital letters. Youth sexoffenders on the registry are sometimes denied access to education becauseresidency restriction laws prevent them from being in or near a school. Youthsex offender registrants despair of ever finding employment, even while theyare burdened with mandatory fees that can reach into the hundreds of dollars onan annual basis.Youth sex offenderregistrants often cannot find housing that meets residency restriction rules,meaning that they and their families struggle to house themselves and oftenexperience periods of homelessness. Families of youth offenders also confrontenormous obstacles in living together as a family—often becauseregistrants are prohibited from living with other children.Finally, the impacts of beinga youth offender subject to registration are multi-generational—affectingthe parents, and also the children, of former offenders. The children of youthsex offenders often cannot be dropped off at school by their parent. They maybe banned by law from hosting a birthday party involving other children attheir home; and they are often harassed and ridiculed by their peers for theirparents’ long-past transgressions.Onerous RestrictionsSome restrictions imposed onthe lives of registrants are so onerous and labyrinthine, it is surprising thatregistrants actually manage to adhere to them. Many do not. The consequences ofrunning afoul of sex offender registration laws can be severe. The crime of“failure to register” is a felony in many states, carrying lengthyprison sentences. The complex rules and regulations that govern the lives ofsex offenders on the registry are particularly difficult to navigate when youthoffenders, like the majority of those interviewed for this report, first beginregistering when they are still children.Many youth sex offendersnever learn that they will have to register until after they accept a plea dealand often after they serve their time in prison or juvenile detention. This isespecially likely to be true of children in the juvenile system, where there isno clear legal obligation that they be informed of the consequences of theiradmissions of guilt. Youth sex offenders are also sometimes subjected toretroactive registration requirements for offenses committed decades in thepast—even after years of living safely in the community. Recent laws,like the Adam Walsh Act, reserve the harshest punishments for those who targetchildren. Yet this means that it is often children themselves who experiencethese harsher penalties, because their crimes almost always involve other kids.It is unknown how manypersons are subject to registration laws in the United States for crimescommitted as children. However, in 2011, there were 747,408 sex offenderregistrants (adult and youth offenders) in the country. What proportion ofthese people committed sexual offenses as children is impossible to determinefrom publicly available national data.Human Rights Watch tried invarious ways to obtain this information, but to no avail. We requested data onoffenders registered for crimes committed as children from all 50 states. Twostates responded with aggregate counts but we were unable to determine thepercentage of total registrants these individuals represent. Our attempts touse public registries to obtain counts were stymied by the fact that states andthe federal government do not independently track the age of registrants atoffense; moreover, state data may undercount the reality. Since the family membersof youth sex offenders often must abide by residency restriction laws if theywant to live together, the numbers of people in the US affected by these lawsis significant.Faulty Assumptions About YouthSex OffendersFaulty assumptions aboutyouth sex offenders’ tendency to recidivate are but one set of flawedassumptions underpinning registration laws. Registering sex offenders andpublicizing information about them is predicated on the idea that sex crimesare committed by strangers. However, evidence suggests that about 86 percent ofsex offenses are committed by persons known to the victim. According to theJustice Department, 93 percent of sexually abused children are molested byfamily members, close friends, or acquaintances. Registration will not protect a victim from a family member.Moreover, early thinkingabout juvenile sexual offending behavior was based on what was known aboutadult child molesters, particularly the adult pedophile, under the mistaken beliefthat a significant portion of them began their offending during childhood.However, more recent clinical models emphasize that this retrospective logichas obscured important motivational, behavioral, and prognostic differencesbetween youth sex offenders and adult sex offenders and has thereforeoverestimated the role of deviant sexual tendencies in people convicted of sexoffenses as children. More current models emphasize the diversity amongchildren who commit sexual offenses, who in the great majority of cases have afavorable prognosis for never reoffending sexually.Registering youth sexoffenders is bad public policy for other reasons, including the fact itoverburdens law enforcement with large numbers of people to monitor,undifferentiated by their dangerousness. With thousands of new registrantsadded each year, law enforcement is stymied in their attempt to focus on themost dangerous offenders. Sexoffender registries treat very different types of offenses and offenders in thesame way. Instead of using available tools to assess the dangerousness ofparticular people who commit sex offenses as children, most sex offender lawspaint them all with the same brush, irrespective of the variety of offensesthey may have committed and in total denial of their profound differences fromadults.Not all statesapply sex offender registration law indiscriminately to youth offenders. InOklahoma, for example, children adjudicated delinquent of sex offenses aretreated in a manner more consistent with juvenile sexual offending behavior. There,a child accused of committing a registerable sex offense undergoes a riskevaluation process reviewed by a panel of experts and a juvenile court judge.The preference is for treatment, not registration, and most high-risk youth areplaced in treatment programs with registration decisions deferred until theyare released, at which point they may no longer be deemed high-risk. Theprograms and attention provided by the state to high-risk youth means that veryfew youth are ultimately registered. The few children that are placed on theregistry have their information disclosed only to law enforcement, and youthoffenders are removed once they reach the age of 21.Accountability That FitsThe harm thatpeople convicted of sex offenses as children have caused to victims of sexualassault must be acknowledged, and justice often requires punishment. As a humanrights organization, Human Rights Watch seeks to prevent sexual violence and toensure accountability for sexual assaults.Butaccountability achieved through punishment should fit both the offense and theoffender. Good public policy should deliver measurable protection to thecommunity and measurable benefit to victims. There is little reason to believethat registering people who commit sexual offenses as children delivers either.Under human rights law, youth sex offenders should be treated in a manner thatreflects their age and capacity for rehabilitation and respects their rights tofamily unity, to education, and to be protected from violence. Protecting thecommunity and limiting unnecessary harm to youth sex offenders are not mutuallyincompatible goals. Instead, they can enhance and reinforce each other.Human RightsWatch believes that unless and until evidence-based research shows that sexoffender registration schemes or other means of monitoring  youth sexoffenders have real benefits for public safety, persons convicted of sexoffenses committed as children should not be subject to registration, communitynotification, or residency restriction requirements. If some youth offendersare subject to these laws, they should never be automatically placed onregistries without undergoing an individualized assessment of their particularneeds for treatment and rehabilitation, including a periodic review of thenecessity of registration. Society’s goal should be returning them to thecommunity, not ostracizing them to the point that they and their families arebanished from any semblance of a normal life.MethodologyThis report is based primarily on an investigation conductedat Human Rights Watch by Soros Senior Justice Advocacy Fellow Nicole Pittman,between September 2011 and early March 2013. Pittman is considered a leading nationalexpert on the application of sex offender registration and notification laws tochildren. Before joining Human Rights Watch, she worked as an attorney at theDefender Association of Philadelphia, where she specialized in and consulted nationallyon child sexual assault cases and registries. Pittman has provided testimony tonumerous legislatures, including the US Congress, on the subject.In this report, in line withinternational law, the terms “child” and “children”refer to a person or persons below the age of 18. We use the term “youthsex offender” to describe any person who was below the age of 18 at thetime they committed the sex offense that led to their placement on a registry, evenif they are now an adult. Individuals who were required to register as sexoffenders while they were below age 18 are referred to in this report as“youth registrants” or “child registrants.”In all, we investigated 517 cases of individuals whocommitted sexual offenses as children across 20 states for this report,including in Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, NewYork, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. Additional information was collectedfrom Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin.We conducted in-person interviews with 281 youth sexoffenders, as well as immediate family members of another 15, in those 20states. These 296 in-person interviews form the basis for many of the findingsof this report.Human Rights Watch selected the 20 states because of theirgeographic diversity and different policy approaches to youth sex offenders. Atthe time of our research:Ten of the 20 research states were deemed tohave “substantially implemented” the national Sex OffenderRegistration and Notification Act (Delaware, Florida, Kansas, Maryland,Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina).[2]Four of the 20 states did not subject any childrenfound delinquent of sex offenses in juvenile court proceedings (as opposed tocriminal court proceedings) to sex offender registration (Georgia, Nevada, NewYork, and Pennsylvania).Ten of the states subjected children foundguilty in both juvenile and criminal court proceedings to sex offenderregistration laws, and had done so since the mid-1990s (Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey,Texas, South Carolina, and Washington). Several of the states had nominimum age of juvenile jurisdiction and had put children as young as eight ontheir registries.The three states with the largest number of registered sex offenders (adults andchildren) were California (106,216), Texas (68,529), and Florida (57,896).[3]In addition to our interviews with people placed on sex offender registries for offenses committed aschildren, we spoke with family members ofregistrants, defense attorneys, prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officials,academic experts, juvenile justice advocates, mental health professionals, and victimsof child-on-child sexual assault. Individuals placed on the registry foroffenses committed as adults were not interviewed for this report.Approximately 95 percent of the youth offenders we interviewedwere found delinquent of sex offenses in juvenile court proceedings; less thanfive percent were convicted in criminal courts. Many of the registrants weresubjected to the same sex offender registration, public disclosure, andresidency restrictions as adults.We identified the majority of intervieweesthrough a written request we posted in a bulletin circulated among loved onesof individuals on registries, mental health treatment providers, juvenileadvocates, social workers, and defense attorneys. Approximately 100interviewees were identified by a search of state sex offender registries. Inaddition to seeking geographic diversity, we sought registrants from an arrayof locations (including both rural and urban areas) and ethnic and racialbackgrounds.The overwhelming majority of the individuals interviewed forthis report started registering when they were children (under age 18).Registrants were between the ages of 14 and 48 at the time we interviewed them.We made a substantial effort to interview registrants of various ages to betterassess the impact of being a child or adolescent on the sex offender registry. Themajority of the interviews with youth offenders were conducted at their homes.All interviews were conducted in private. A family member or significant otherwas present for a portion of most of the interviews.Interviews were semi-structured and covered a range oftopics related to how, if at all, being on the sex offender registry affectedaspects of a registrant’s life—such as the ability to go to school,obtain and maintain employment, secure housing, and associate with family. Registrantswere also asked a series of questions to determine whether the registrant experiencedpsycho-social harm, felt vulnerable to or experienced violence, or was subjectto discrimination because of his or her status as a registrant.Before each interview, Human Rights Watch informed eachinterviewee of the purpose of the investigation and the kinds of issues thatwould be covered, and asked whether they wanted to participate. A parent orguardian gave permission before contact was made with potential intervieweesunder the age of 18. We informed interviewees that they could discontinue the interviewat any time or decline to answer any specific questions without consequence. Nofinancial incentives were offered or provided to persons interviewed.Human Rights Watch has disguised with pseudonyms theidentities of all interviewees, except in two cases where the degree ofpublicity surrounding the cases made disguising the identities impossible, andwe had the informed consent of the two individuals to use their real names. Alldocuments cited in the report are publicly available or on file with HumanRights Watch.I. BackgroundChild-on-ChildSexual Violence in the United StatesSexual violence is a serious problem in the United States.According to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) study, an estimated 125,910 rapesand sexual assaults occurred in the United States in 2009 (the most recent yearfor which data are available).[4] Anestimated 24,930 of the victims were between the ages of 12 and 19 at the timeof the assaults.[5] The DOJstudy did not examine how many of these incidents involved adult or youthoffenders.While 24,930 incidents of sexual violence against children isa disturbing number, it may be an underestimate. Victim fear, shame, or loyaltyto the abuser can each contribute to the underreporting of sexual violence.[6]For example, a study by the National Institute of Justice found that only onein five adult women rape victims (19 percent) reported their rapes to police.[7]Failure to disclose sexual abuse is also common among children.There is evidence, however, that victims today—including child victims—are more likelyto disclose abuse, at least to loved ones, than they once were. Dr. MarcChaffin, an expert and professor of pediatrics at University of Oklahoma HealthSciences Center, told Human Rights Watch that recent studies suggest that “abouthalf of child victims tell someone.”[8] While this does not necessarily mean more incidentsare getting reported to police, it is clear that child victims are more likelyto disclose abuse than in decades past.[9]Historically, the reluctance or inability of survivors ofabuse or their family members to report sexual assault crimes has contributedto under-enforcement of the law: the vast majority of sex crimes do not lead toarrests and convictions.[10]A study examining data from 1991 to 1996 found that sexual assaults on childvictims were more likely to result in an arrest (29 percent) than were assaultson adults (22 percent), but assaults on children under age six resulted in anarrest in only 19 percent of the cases.[11]For adults, the emotional and psychological consequences ofsexual violence can be profound and enduring and include depression, anxiety,and post-traumatic stress disorder.[12]According to the American Psychological Association, children who have beensexually abused may suffer a range of short- and long-term problems, includingdepression, anxiety, eating disorders, guilt, fear, withdrawal,self-destructive behaviors, and sexual acting out.[13]This study did not differentiate between the experiences of victims who wereabused by adults and those abused by other children. According to Dr. Marc Chaffin, who has studied the specific impacts onchild victims of child-on-child sexual offenses,The overarching summary of the research is this—thereare a substantial number of victims who recover and are not highly affectedbeyond a short time. There is a middle group with moderate effects. And thereis a group with severe and often lasting effects.[14]In many cases, the trauma ofchild sexual abuse is made more complex because the abuse occurs within thefamily. Denise, a single mother of two boys, Troy (age 15) and Ted (age 12), recalled theday Ted confided in her that he had been sexually abused by Troy: “Ted explained that ‘he had beentouched on his private parts’ by his older brother.”[15] Denise continued, “I felt like I had heard theworst thing a mother can hear. I felt confused and shocked. As I listened toTed, I began feeling everything through him and seeing it through his eyes. Ifelt so deeply sad for what he had been through, and I battled with feelings ofresponsibility. What could I have done to prevent this? Why didn’t I seethe signs?”[16] Denise immediatelybegan getting help for both her sons and making sure they were both safe fromrepeating these behaviors. She stated that it,[B]ecame clear the boys could not be left alone together.At first, it actually felt like things were getting worse not better,especially when Ted confided in me saying, “I lock my bedroom door atnight,” as he described how he fears a visit from his brother…. Iwish I could explain what it is like to be the parent of both a child who hasbeen abusing and a child who has been victimized. The feelings are so mixed andconfusing. I love both my sons, but at times I felt guilty and ashamed that Icared for Troy even though he had hurt Ted.[17]Child sexual abuse is a complicated form of harm. The effect sexual violence can have on survivors,their family members, and their communities can be harrowing. After a sexualassault, victims may experience a wide range of emotions, such as sadness,anger, fear, shame, guilt, grief, or self-blame; and they may grow up toexperience a variety of psychological, social, relationship, and physicaldifficulties.[18]Not only are victims left to cope with the verypersonal and intense after-effects of a sexual assault, but they also must dealwith the tangible costs associated with the assault, including medical care, counseling,and potential lost wages.[19] In light of all of this, and given thepotential consequences for child victims, ending sexual offenses againstchildren is a legitimate priority.History of Sex OffenderRegistration and Notification Laws in the USIn part as a result of high-profile cases of sexual abuse inthe late 1980s and 1990s, state and federal policymakers passed an array ofregistration, community notification, and residency restriction laws for individualsconvicted of sex offenses.Registration refers to a setof procedures that offenders must follow to disclose information to lawenforcement authorities and to periodically update or “register”that information so that it remains current.Community notification refersto systems by which information about registrants is transmitted to the publicor portions of the public.Residency restriction lawsrefer to mostly state and local ordinances that limit registrants’ability to live in or spend any time in specific locations (such as near aschool).Each state, US territory, and federally-recognized IndianTribe now has its own set of sex offender registration, notification, andresidency restriction laws. Overlaying this diversity is a series of federallaws.Early Sex OffenderRegistration and Community Notification LawsThe first federal law addressing sex offender registration, theJacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children andSexually Violent Offender Registration Act of 1994 (the “WetterlingAct”) established a national database of sex offenders and conditioned states’receipt of federal anti-crime funds on state compliance with the act.[20] Specifically, it required states to create registriesof offenders convicted of sexually violent offenses or crimes against childrenand to establish heightened registration requirements for highly dangerous sexoffenders. States moved quickly toimplement federal sex offender legislation, with a majority passingnotification and registration statutes for adult sex offenders between 1994 and1996.[21]Congress passed its first community notification law in 1996in response to the abduction and murder of seven-year-old New Jersey residentMegan Kanka.[22] UnderMegan’s Law, community notification requirements applied only toindividuals identified as “potentially dangerous sex offenders.”[23]Community notification systems proliferated rapidly through a series ofamendments to Megan’s Law. Some form of community notification for adultsex offenders has been present in all 50 states and the District of Columbiasince 1996.The Lychner Act, passed in 1996, amended the federalcommunity notification laws, providing for a national database to track sexoffenders and subjecting certain offenders to lifetime registration andnotification requirements.[24] Both ofthese laws have been superseded by the 2006 Adam Walsh Act (discussed below).[25]Incorporationof Youth Sex Offenders in Registration and Notification LawsWhen first adopted, federal registration and notification lawsneither required nor prohibited inclusion of persons convicted of sex offensesas children (youth sex offenders). But by the mid-1990s, many state sexoffender registration laws were drafted to include children adjudicateddelinquent of sex offenses as well as children tried and convicted of sexoffenses in adult court. The resulting policies swept youth sex offenders intoa system created to regulate the post-conviction lives of adult sex offenders.Youth sex offenders were caught at the convergence of twoincreasingly harsh “tough on crime” policy agendas: one targetingpersons convicted of sexual offenses, and the other targeting youth accused ofviolent offenses, who were often portrayed at the time as “superpredators”—anotion that has since been discredited.[26] Theoverheated rhetoric surrounding the issue scared the public, and politiciansresponded, including with increasingly broad laws affecting youth sex offenders.In an effort to protect children from sexual assault and hold sex offendersaccountable, lawmakers failed to fully consider that some of the sex offendersthey were targeting were themselves children, in need of policy responsestailored to their specific needs and circumstances.[27]Today, federal law and the laws of all 50 states requireadults to register with law enforcement. Eleven states and the District ofColumbia do not register any child offenders adjudicated delinquent in juvenilecourt. However, these 12 jurisdictions do require registration for children convictedof sex offenses in adult court.[28] Thirty-eightstates register both children convicted of sex offenses in adult court andthose adjudicated in the juvenile system.[29]State notification laws establish public access to registryinformation, primarily by mandating the creation of online registries thatprovide a former offender’s criminal history, current photograph, currentaddress, and other information such as place of employment. In many states,everyone who is required to register is included on the online registry. In the 50 states and the District of Columbia, adultsand children convicted in criminal court are generally subject to publicnotification, meaning that these individuals are included on the onlineregistry. Children adjudicated delinquent injuvenile court are subject to the same public notification as adults in 27states, allowing for the disclosure of child offenders’ privateinformation to the public.[30]A growing number of states and municipalities have alsoprohibited registered offenders from living within a designated distance(typically 500 to 2,500 feet) of places where children gather, such as schools,playgrounds, and daycare centers.The Adam Walsh Act’sSORNAIn an effort to standardize the vast and growing number ofstate sex offender registration systems, Congress passed the Adam Walsh ChildProtection and Safety Act in 2006.[31]Title I of the Adam Walsh Act, the Sex Offender Registration and NotificationAct (SORNA), provides a set of federal guidelines that further expands thebreadth of sex offender registration and notification in the 50 states, theDistrict of Columbia, the five US territories, and federally-recognized tribalterritories. The Adam Walsh Act did not, in its initial draft, specifically addressthe situation of child offenders. However, an amendment known as the Amie ZylaProvision expanded the scope of the act to include certain juvenile courtadjudications in the act’s definition of “conviction”(children convicted in adult court already fell within the definition).[32]SORNA made several broad changes to existing federalguidelines on sex offender registration that include, but are not limited to:Mandating that children register, ifprosecuted and convicted as adults or adjudicated delinquent in familycourt for a sex offense comparable or more serious than “aggravatedsexual abuse or sexual abuse.”[33]Establishing a new federal and statecriminal offense of “failure to register,” punishable by a term ofimprisonment.[34]Requiring registration for offenses that maynot be considered sexual offenses in some jurisdictions, such as indecentexposure, kidnapping, false imprisonment of a child, public urination, rape,incest, indecency with a child by touching, and possession of child pornography.[35]Requiring jurisdictions to reclassify therisk level of each sex offender based solely on the crime of conviction oradjudication, with no reference to individualized risk assessment.[36]To comply with SORNA, jurisdictions must also requireregistered offenders to keep their information current in each jurisdiction inwhich they reside, work, or attend school.[37]Jurisdictions that fail to enact the SORNA guidelines risk losing 10 percent oftheir Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance federal funding.[38]After the federal government granted severalextensions, the deadline to comply with SORNA was July 2011. Five years afterthe act was signed into law, no jurisdiction has “completely implemented”SORNA, and only 13 have “substantially implemented” the law. On thedeadline, several states signaled that they still were unable to implementSORNA.[39] According to a 2013 US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on thestatus of SORNA implementation, as of November 2012, 37 of 56 jurisdictions hadsubmitted complete implementation packages for review, and the US Department ofJustice’s (DOJ) Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending,Registering, and Tracking (SMART) office had determined that 19 of thosejurisdictions (16 states and 3 territories) had substantially implemented SORNAand another 17 had not.[40] The 16 states deemed by the DOJto have substantially implemented SORNA were Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi,Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,and Wyoming.[41]An Overbroad Policy ofQuestionable EffectivenessThroughout the United States, sex offender registriesinclude offenders convicted for a range of acts, from offensive or vulgarbehavior to heinous crimes. Registries create the impression that neighborhoodsare thick with recidivist sexual predators, making it impossible for residents,including parents, to discern who actually is dangerous.[42]Sex-offender registries now include not only persons who committed sexuallyviolent offenses or crimes such as kidnapping or false imprisonment of a minor,but also people who have committed offenses like public urination, indecentexposure (such as streaking across a college campus), and other more relativelyinnocuous offenses. Many people assume that anyone listed on the sex offenderregistry must be a rapist or a child molester. But most states spread the netmuch more widely.[43]Sex offender registration schemes were initially designed tohelp police monitor the “usual suspects”; that is, to capture thenames and addresses of previously convicted adult sex offenders on a list,which could be referred to whenever a new offense was committed. In theory,this was a well-intentioned method to protect children and communities fromfurther instances of sexual assault. In reality, this policy was based on amisconception: that everyone found guilty of a sex offense is a recidivistpedophile. However, according to the National Center on Sexual Behavior ofYouth, “most adolescents are not sexual predators nor do they meet theaccepted criteria for pedophilia.”[44]Individuals who commit sexual offenses are not all the same.A one-size-fits-all approach to sex offender registration does not contributeto public safety, especially since, as described further below, the mostdangerous offenders are often supervised in the same way as very low-riskoffenders who are not likely to commit new sex offenses.A 2008 report from the Texas Department of Public Safetyrevealed that the number of registered sex offenders in Texas more than tripledbetween 1999 and 2008. The 2008 figure was 54,000 offenders, including nearly7,500 who were placed on the registry for offenses committed as children.[45]Ray Allen, a former chair of the Texas House Corrections Committee who oncehelped push the tougher sex offender registration bills into law, admitted thathe and his colleagues went too far. “We cast the net widely to make surewe got all the sex offenders … it turns out that really only a smallpercentage of people convicted of sex offenses pose a true danger to thepublic.”[46]Doesthe Registry Prevent Sex Offenses?Despite the massive growth in the number of registered sexoffenders, studies of states that have implemented registration requirementsare inconclusive as to whether the registries have any effect on the incidenceof reported sex offenses. One study of 10 states with registries concluded that“the results do not offer a clear unidirectional conclusion as to whethersex offender notification laws prevent rapes.”[47]A study in New Jersey found that sex offense rates have been on a consistentdownward trend since 1985, with the data showing that the greatest rate ofdecline in sex offending occurred prior to 1994 (the year registration lawswere passed) and the least rate of decline occurred after 1995 (the yearregistration laws were implemented).[48] Thereare at least three flaws that help to explain the ineffectiveness of sexoffender registries in deterring crime.First, sex offender registries are focused on preventingrecidivism, when instead the focus should be on deterring the first offense fromever happening.[49] The focus on recidivism ismisguided because sex offenders are among the least likely to reoffend.Individuals labeled as “sex offenders” have extremely lowrecidivism rates when compared to persons convicted of robbery, non-sexual assault,burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, fraud, drug offenses, and public orderoffenses.[50] Theonly type of offense with lower recidivism rates is homicide.[51]As discussed in detail in the following chapter, youthoffenders, including youth sex offenders, have even lower rates of recidivismthan adults. The emotion provoked by the sexual abuse of a child ispowerful—powerful enough to make many overlook the embedded falsepresumptions and misperceptions about risks of reoffending, especially withregard to children who have committed sexual offenses against other children.[52]But research indicates that these terrible crimes are extremely unlikely to becommitted by an individual who was labeled a sex offender as a child.Second, sex offender registrationoverburdens law enforcement. Detective BobShilling, a 29-year decorated veteran of the Seattle Police Department whospent 20 years as a detective in the Special Victim’s Unit, Sex andKidnapping Offender Detail, for the Seattle Police, explained how hisofficers were required to make home visits to registered sex offenders. Hestated that focusing attention and resources on an overly broad group ofex-offenders detracts attention from the smaller number of sexually violentoffenses that occur, leaving communities vulnerable to sexual abuse, creating afalse sense of security, and exhausting valuable resources by tracking the“wrong offenders”—that is, individuals not likely to everreoffend sexually. The detective said, “themost recent laws dilute the effectiveness of the registry as a public safetytool, by flooding it with thousands of low risk offenders like children, thevast majority of whom will never commit another sex offense.”[53]Third, registration fails to target resources where they aremost needed. Federal guidelines adopted under SORNA risk worsening the problemby mandating that states eliminate the use of risk assessment tools to helpidentify those offenders who are likely to reoffend. Instead, as noted above, theguidelines require states to use “crime of conviction” as the solemeans to classify offenders. Detective Schilling describedthe focus on crime of conviction “inherently flawed,” because sexoffenders differ greatly in their level of impulsiveness, persistence, risk tothe community, and desire to change their deviant behavior. Assigning sexoffender tiers based on crime of conviction provides very little informationabout who a sex offender is and what his or her risk for reoffense may be.[54]All of these factors add more nonviolent, lower riskoffenders to the registry—including youth offenders. While the sex offenderdatabase grows exponentially, funding for monitoring sex offenders is on thedecline.[55]A2011 review of state sex offender registration legislation applied to childoffenders found that only a small number of states were registering child sex offenders based solelyupon the type of offense.[56]Most states that included child offendersin pre-SORNA registration schemes also designed safeguards to protect them,such as judicial discretion, consideration of individual circumstances, assessmentof risk, or early termination of juvenile registration. The authors of thesurvey characterized these findings as noteworthy because “the need tocomply with SORNA is pushing states in the opposite direction.”[57]II. Children AreDifferent[C]hildren are constitutionally different from adults.…[J]uveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform… [and] are less deserving of the most severe punishments.…[C]hildren have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility… [c]hildren are more vulnerable … to negative influences andoutside pressures … [a]nd … a child’s character is not aswell formed as an adult’s.—Miller v. Alabama, United States Supreme Court, 2012 (No. 10‐9646, slip op. at 8 (2012)).Federal and state laws on sexoffender registration and notification fail to take into accountrelevant—indeed, fundamental—differences between children andadults. These include not only differences in cognitive capacity, which affecttheir culpability, but also differences in their amenability to rehabilitation,in the nature of their sexual behaviors and offenses and in the likelihood thatthey will reoffend. Indeed recent laws, like the Adam Walsh Act, reservethe harshest punishments for those who target children without seeming toappreciate that child offenders, whose crimes almost always involve other kids,are particularly likely to be subjected to these harsher penalties. As noted by Berkeley law professor Frank Zimring,“nobody is making policy for 12-year-olds in Americanlegislatures.… What they’re doing is they’re making crimepolicy and then almost by accident extending those policies to12-year-olds—with poisonous consequences.”[58]Cognitive and DevelopmentalDifferencesIt is axiomatic that children are in the process of growingup, both physically and mentally. Their forming identities make young offendersexcellent candidates for rehabilitation—they are far more able thanadults to learn new skills, find new values, and re-embark on a better,law-abiding life. Justice is best served when these rehabilitative principles, whichare at the core of human rights standards, are at the heart of responses tochild sex offending.Psychological research confirms what every parent knows:children, including teenagers, act more irrationally and immaturely thanadults. Adolescent thinking is present-oriented and tends to ignore, discount,or not fully understand future outcomes and implications.[59]Children also have a greater tendency than adults to make decisions based onemotions, such as anger or fear, rather than logic and reason.[60]And stressful situations only heighten the risk that emotion, rather than rationalthought, will guide the choices children make.[61] Research has further clarified that the issue is not just the cognitive difference between children and adults, but a difference in “maturity ofjudgment” stemming from a complex combination of the ability to make gooddecisions and social and emotional capability.[62]Neuroscientists are now providing a physiologicalexplanation for the features of childhood that developmental psychologists—aswell as parents and teachers—have identified for years.[63]MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images of the anatomy and function of thebrain at different ages and while an individual performs a range of tasks revealthe immaturity of the portions of children’s brains associated withreasoning and emotional equilibrium.[64]It is in large part these developmental and cognitive differences that havecaused the US Supreme Court to conclude that juveniles are “categoricallyless culpable” than adults when they commit offenses.[65]Moreover, the fact that young people continue to developinto early adulthood suggests that they may be particularly amenable to change.[66]“The reality that juveniles still struggle to define theiridentity,” noted the US Supreme Court in its 2005 Roper v. Simmonsdecision, “means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinouscrime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depravedcharacter.”[67] Bothcriminologists and development experts agree that “[f]or most teens,these [risky or illegal] behaviors are fleeting. Only a relatively smallproportion of adolescents who experiment in risky or illegal activities developentrenched patterns of problem behavior that persist into adulthood.”[68]ChildSexual Misconduct: A Distinct and Varied Set of BehaviorsThe image of the adult sexual predator is a poor fit for thevast majority of children who commit sexual offenses. Children are not merelyyounger versions of adult sexual offenders.[69]Current science contradicts the theory that children who havecommitted a sexual offense specialize in sexual crime, nor is there anyevidence of the kind of fixed, abnormal sexual preferences that are part of theimage of a pedophile.[70] Although those who commit sex offenses against children are oftendescribed as “pedophiles” or “predators” and areassumed to be adults, it is important to understand that a substantial portionof these offenses are committed by other youth who do not fit such labels.Dr. Marc Chaffin, a leading expert on child sexual offendingbehavior and professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma HealthSciences Center, explains that “early thinking about juvenile sexoffenders was based on what wasknown about adult child molesters, particularly adult pedophiles, givenfindings that a significant portion of them began their offending duringadolescence.” However, current clinical typologies and models suggestthat this assessment is flawed.[71] In fact, empirical evidence, as discussedbelow, shows that if a history of child sexual offending is used to predict aperson’s likelihood of future sex offending, that prediction would bewrong more than nine times out of ten.[72]Compared to adult sexual offending, sexual misconduct bychildren is generally less aggressive, often more experimental than deviant,and occurs over shorter periods of time.[73] Thatsaid, there is considerable diversity in the sexual behaviors that bringchildren into clinical settings. Child sex offenses range from “sharing pornographywith younger children, fondling a child over the clothes, [and] grabbing peersin a sexual way at school, [to] date rape, gang rape, or performing oral,vaginal, or anal sex on a much younger child.”[74] Enormous diversity alsoexists within the population of children who commit sex offenses.[75]One expert explains that the population includes:Traumatized young girls reacting to their own sexualvictimization; persistently delinquent teens who commit both sexual andnonsexual crimes; otherwise normal early-adolescent boys who are curious aboutsex and act experimentally but irresponsibly; generally aggressive and violentyouth; immature and impulsive youth acting without thinking; so-called Romeoand Juliet cases; those who are indifferent to others and selfishly take whatthey want; youth misinterpreting what they believed was consent or mutualinterest; children imitating actions they have seen in the media; youthignorant of the law or the potential consequences of their actions; youthattracted to the thrill of rule violation; youth imitating what is normal intheir own family or social ecology; depressed or socially isolated teens whoturn to younger juveniles as substitutes for age-mates; seriously mentally illyouth; youth responding primarily to peer pressure; youth preoccupied with sex;youth under the influence of drugs and alcohol; youth swept away by the sexualarousal of the moment; or youth with incipient sexual deviancy problems.[76]Youth sex offenders come from a variety of social and familybackgrounds.[77]In some cases, a history of childhood sexual abuse appears to contribute tochild sexual offending behavior, but most child sex abuse survivors do notbecome sex offenders in adolescence or adulthood.[78]Some child offenders have experienced significant adversity, includingmaltreatment or exposure to physical violence; others have not.Many of the sexual behaviorsof youth are problematic, and need to be addressed in a clinical setting or bythe justice system, but placing children who commit sex offenses on a registry—oftenfor life— is going too far.Recidivism of Youth Sex OffendersAs noted above, thereis no scientific foundation for the belief that children who commit sexualoffenses pose a danger of future sexual predation.[79] Once detected, most adolescentswho have engaged in sexually abusive behavior do not continue to engage inthese behaviors.[80]Studies consistentlyfind that adult sex offenses are committed by individuals not known to havebeen youth sex offenders.[81]Recidivism rates for youth sexoffenders are consistently low. One study that included a cohort composedmostly of youth convicted of violent sex offenses found a recidivism rate of 10percent.[82] Several studieshave found recidivism rates for all youth sex offenders (violent and nonviolent offenses) at between four and seven percent, and one recent study found the rate to be as low as one percent.[83] A meta-analysis that reviewed 63 data sets reporting on the re-offense behavior of 11,219 youth sex offenders found an estimated mean sexual recidivism rate of 7.08 percent across a 5-year follow-up period.[84] These rates should be compared with a 13 percent recidivism rate for adults who commit sexual offenses[85] and a national recidivism rate of 40 percent for all criminal offenses.[86]A 2007 study by University ofCalifornia, Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring found that youth sexoffenders have “a low volume of sexual recidivism during their juvenilecareers, and an even lower propensity for sexual offenses during youngadulthood.”[87] Another study found that when youth sex offendersare re-arrested, it is “far more likely to be for nonsexual crimes suchas property or drug offenses than for sex crimes.”[88]One of Zimring’s studies found that youths with five or more arrests foroffenses other than sex offenses pose twice the risk of being arrested inadulthood for a sex offense than do youth sex offenders with fewer than fivearrests.[89] Giventhe low rates of recidivism among youth sex offenders, Zimring points out that if the goal of sex offender registrationis to compile a list of names of possible future sex offenders, it would bemore effective to register youth offenders with five or more contacts with lawenforcement for non-sexual offenses as potential future sex offenders than toregister youth sex offenders.III. Who are Youth Sex Offender Registrants?The enactment across the United States of increasinglycomprehensive sex offender registration laws has brought predictable results: thenumber of individuals (adult and youth offenders) placed on sex offenderregistries has exploded. In February 2001, approximately 386,000 individuals nationwidewere listed on sex offender registries.[90]By 2011, there were 747,408 registered sex offenders in the country.[91]While it may be safe to assume that the number of registeredyouth offenders has expanded alongside adult registrants, there are nodisaggregated national statistics on youth sex offenders. This chaptertherefore contains information Human Rights Watch culled mainly from our interviewswith 281 youth sex offenders and the family members of another 15 youth(comprising 296 cases).[92] Theinterviewees were identified through chain-referral sampling (where attorneys,family members, advocates, and registrants recruit future subjects from amongtheir networks), so the resulting data involves selection bias.[93]Even with that limitation, our interviews provide important insights into thebackgrounds of many youth offenders on sex offender registries.AgeThroughout the United States, children as young as nineyears old who are adjudicated delinquent may be subject to sex offender registrationlaws. For example, in Delaware in 2011, there were approximately 639 childrenon the sex offender registry, 55 of whom were under the age of 12.[94]In 2010, Michigan counted a total of 3,563 youth offenders adjudicateddelinquent on its registry, a figure that does not include Michigan’s youthoffenders convicted in adult court.[95] In2010, Michigan’s youngest registered sex offenders were nine years old.[96]A 2009 Department of Justice study, which focused only on sex crimes committedby children in which other children were the victims, found that one out of eightyouth sex offenders committing crimes against other children was younger than12.[97]Human Rights Watch recorded several important dates for eachof the youth sex offenders interviewed for this report, allowing us todetermine their age at conviction and the age they were first placed on theregistry. The median age at conviction or adjudication was 15. The median ageat first registration was 16. Eight interviewed registrants were age 10 oryounger at the time of their conviction and when registration began, with theyoungest being 9 years old.  A full 84 percent of those interviewed byHuman Rights Watch were 17 years old or younger when they beganregistering.OffensesMost jurisdictions mandate registration of childrenconvicted of a wide range of sex offenses in adult court. The federal SexOffender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) expanded the range of sexoffenses requiring registration.[98] Notably,it was expanded to include certain sex offenses committed by children adjudicateddelinquent in juvenile court.[99] Underthe Act, a “sex offense” includes offenses having “an elementinvolving a sexual act or contact with another”;[100]“video voyeurism”; having possession, producing, or distributingchild pornography; and “[a]ny conduct that by its nature is a sex offenseagainst a minor.”[101] The“sexual act[s]” or “contact” covered under SORNAinclude (i) oral-genital or oral-anal contact, (ii) any degree of genital oranal penetration, and (iii) direct genital touching of a child under the age of16.[102]Implementation of registration, including the federal SORNAprovisions, varies across jurisdictions, resulting in a wide variety of offensesand offenders triggering registration requirements. For example:In Kansas, any child convicted of a sexoffense in adult court is subject to the same registration requirements asadults. Juveniles adjudicated delinquent for a sex offense in Kansas are also subjectto registration for a long list of offenses including rape, indecent libertieswith a child, criminal sodomy, indecent solicitation of a child, aggravatedincest, electronic solicitation, and unlawful sexual relations. The list alsoincludes attempt or conspiracy to commit the above crimes, criminalsolicitation of the crimes, or “any act determined beyond a reasonabledoubt to have been sexually motivated.”[103]In Arkansas, the courts have discretion toorder registration requirements for youth offenders convicted in adult court aswell as children adjudicated delinquent for “any offense with anunderlying sexually motivated component.”[104]Maryland applies registration requirementsto youth offenders convicted in adult court, but has different requirements forchildren adjudicated delinquent.[105]The following are examples of the wide range of offenses thatcan trigger registration requirements for youth sex offenders:In 2005, in Orange County, California, threeboys were convicted of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl and videotapingthe incident. The crime occurred when one of the boys was 16 and two were 17 yearsold. All three are subject to sex offender registration requirements.[106]In 1997, in Texas, a 12-year-old boy pledguilty to aggravated sexual assault. He inappropriately touched a 7-year-oldgirl at his babysitter’s house. After completing two years of juvenileprobation and therapy, he had to register for ten years. He was finally removedfrom the registry at age 25.[107]In 2004, in Western Pennsylvania, a15-year-old girl was charged with manufacturing and disseminating childpornography for having taken nude photos of herself and posted them on theinternet. She was charged as an adult, and as of 2012 was facing registrationfor life.[108]In March 2010, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,an 18-year-old young man pled guilty to two felony counts of sexual assault andtwo of indecent assault, which will require him to register. The crimesoccurred between October 2003 and December 2008, when the offender was between11 and 16 years old, and involved multiple rapes of a six- or seven-year old girland a six-year-old boy.[109]In 2006, a 13-year old girl from Ogden, Utahwas arrested for rape for having consensual sex with her 12-year-old boyfriend.The young girl, impregnated by her younger boyfriend at the age of 13, was found guilty of violating a state law thatprohibits sex with someone under age 14. Her 12-year-old boyfriend was foundguilty of violating the same law for engaging in sexual activity with her, asshe was also a child under the age of 14 at the time.[110]In 2000, in New Jersey, then-12-year-oldT.T. inserted a “douche” (feminine product) in his 6-year-old half-brother’sanus on one occasion.[111]When asked why he did it, T.T. responded, “I don’t know.”[112]T.T. subsequently pled guilty to aggravated sexual assault and was sent to ajuvenile placement. After incarceration, T.T. was given three years ofprobation and required to register for life.In 1997,Stella A., a 17-year-old high school student, was arrested and pled guilty tosodomy for performing consensual oral sex on a 15-year-old male classmate.[113] Stella was placed on probation and required toregister on the state’s sex offender registry. Her photograph, address,and identifying information were publicly available for neighbors and thepublic to see.The 296 cases examined for this report had a total of 352 convictions(often due to multiple charges arising from the same incident).[114]For purposes of practicality, we grouped the convictions into 53 offensecategories, based on similar offense descriptions. Sexual battery was the mostcommon category of conviction, followed by “lewd lasciviousmolestation” and “unlawful criminal sexual contact.”Offense CategoryNumber of ConvictionsPercentage of ConvictionsSexualBattery707.6%LewdLascivious Molestation384.1%UnlawfulCriminal Sexual Contact343.7%SexualAssault242.6%AggravatedSexual Assault – Child212.3%SexualAbuse131.4%Rape111.2%Sodomy101.1%SexualBattery (multiple counts)101.1%Indecencywith a child – contact101.1%Therewere an additional 111 convictions in 43 other crime categoriesTotal352Statutory RapeWhen sexual interactions involve a non-consenting party,the sexual interactions are, by definition, abusive.[115]In these circumstances, the person (adult or child) who forces sex isreferred to as the “perpetrator” and the non-consenting person isrecognized as a “victim” of sexual abuse.[116]When it comes to child-on-child sexual behavior, the lines between“willingness” and “consent” often become blurred.[117]A child may be “willing” to engage in sexual interactions with apeer, but however willing they may be in one sense, children do not have thepsychological capacity to give consent.[118] Therefore, in astate in which the legal age of consent is 14 years old, a 14-year-old femaleengaging in consensual sexual interactions with her 13-year-old neighbor is acrime. Under many current laws, she could be adjudicated delinquent andrequired to register as a sex offender.Some children are convicted and required to register afterengaging in allegedly consensual sex with other children. These cases, knownas statutory rape cases, have received a great deal of press attention andhave in some cases led states to reform their laws so that children convictedof statutory rape are not required to register.The intent of sex offender registration and notificationlaws is to protect children from sexual victimization and exploitation byadults,[119]and it was not the original intent of federal legislators to criminalizesexual interactions between adolescent peers when there is no evidence ofcoercion.[120]Unfortunately, such criminalization occurs all too frequently.For instance, in Michigan, 17-year-old Alexander D. wasconvicted of criminal sexual conduct for having sex with his 15-year-oldgirlfriend.[121]He has been registering as a sex offender since 2003. Alexander and hisgirlfriend met when they were freshmen in high school and dated for nearly ayear before having sex. In Michigan, the legal age of consent is 16.[122]Alexander has been penniless, has lost jobs, and has been called a“pedophile” by passing strangers.[123]His girlfriend’s parents have written letters on his behalf, asking forhis removal from the registry. However, Alexander will remain on the sexoffender registry until the year 2028.In Florida, an 18-year-old boy, Grayson A., had sex withhis 15-year-old girlfriend. The girlfriend, Lily A., became pregnant and thecouple got married. Despite their marriage, Grayson was arrested andsubsequently convicted of “lewd or lascivious molestation.”Originally charged with rape, Grayson pled no contest to the lewd orlascivious molestation charge.[124]He served two years in prison and was required to register as a sex offenderfor life.[125]The couple, now ages 31 and 35, have two children together. In a 2009interview, Grayson stated that he lost at least 17 jobs because of being onthe sex offender registry.[126]Because his wife was also his victim, the couple could not live together.Grayson became homeless and ended up living in his car.[127]In 2008, the couple consulted a lawyer to challenge the impact the law washaving on their family. In 2009, Attorney General Bill McCollum voted topardon the conviction and remove Grayson from Florida’s registry.[128]Date of Registration, Race, and GenderStates and local jurisdictions have had registration systemsin place for more than two decades; however, with the advent of federal effortsto set minimum registration standards in 1994, followed by the passage ofMegan’s Law in 1996, more and more youth offenders became subject toregistration. With SORNA’s passage in 2006, registrations increased. Amongthose interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report, the majority werefirst placed on sex offender registries between 2007 and 2011. Over 60 percentof the interviewees had been registered for five years or less at the time ofour interviews with them.Although there are no national statistics on the race andgender of youth offenders subject to sex offender registration, a 2009Department of Justice study of youth offenders, examining 2004 data on youthoffenders committing sex offenses against other children, found that 93 percentof the offenders were male.[129] Thestudy did not examine the race of the youth offenders or their victims. Amongthe youth offenders interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report, 96.6percent were male, 60 percent were white, 31 percent were black, and 5.7percent were Latino.IV. Registration of Youth Offenders in PracticeAfter they have served outtheir sentences in juvenile detention or prison, youth sex offenders mustcomply with a complex array of legal requirements applicable to all sexoffenders, whether children or adults. Undersex offender registration laws, youth offenders must register with lawenforcement, providing their name, home address, place of employment, schooladdress, a current photograph, and other personal information.Perhaps the most onerousaspects of registration from the perspective of the youth offender are thecommunity notification and residency restriction requirements, which canrelegate a youth sex offender who has served their time to the margins ofsociety. Under community notificationlaws, the police make registration information accessible to the public,typically via the Internet. And under residency restriction laws, youth sexoffenders are prohibited from living within a designated distance of placeswhere children gather, such as schools, playgrounds, parks, and even bus stops.These requirements can apply for decadesor even a youth offender’s entire life.Read in isolation, certainsex offender registration requirements may appear reasonable and insignificantto some. It is only once the totality of the requirements, their interrelationship,and their operation in practice are examined that their full impact can beunderstood.Community Notification for Youth OffendersCommunity notification involves publicizing informationabout persons on sex offender registries. States and the federal governmentprovide information about sex offenders through publicly accessible websites.Communities are also notified about sex offenders in their area through publicmeetings, fliers, and newspaper announcements. Some jurisdictions have expandednotification to include highway billboards, postcards, lawn signs, and publiclyavailable and searchable websites produced by private entities. One youthoffender told Human Rights Watch, “I have to display a sign in my windowthat says‘Sex Offender Lives Here’.”[130]Click to expand ImageA series of newspaper clippings that a father of two sonshas collected over the years. The two sons are listed on the public sex offenderregistry for offenses committed when they were ages 9 and 11, and they wereoften publicly named in the local newspapers. © 2013 Mariam Dwedar/Human Rights WatchCommunity notification was initially reserved for offendersclassified as having a high risk of reoffending. But today, every jurisdiction that registers sex offenders alsomakes publicly available certain information about them, regardless ofindividual risk classifications and irrespective of the fact that a registrantwas a youth offender.Community notification, as the term is commonly understood,embraces both the public disclosure of registrants’ information and thedisclosure of the information to law enforcement officials only (the latter is oftencalled “non-public” community notification). However, as discussedbelow, the capacity of states and law enforcement to protect the integrity of“non-public” community notification is eroding.Public Disclosure of Child Registration InformationWith the passage of SORNA in 2006, federal guidelines forcommunity notification became more stringent, requiring that states post on publicly accessible websites the picture,home address, and location of the school and employer of certain categories ofsex offenders—whether or not they were juveniles at the time of theoffense. The statewebsites are linked together via the National Sex Offender PublicWebsite (NSOPW).[131]Since 2007, the number of states subjecting children tocommunity notification via the internet has grown as jurisdictions passedlegislation to come into compliance with SORNA.[132] Asnoted by one expert, “[t]hat means on many state sex-offender web sites,you can find juveniles’ photos, names and addresses, and in some casestheir birth dates and maps to their homes, alongside those of pedophiles andadult rapists.”[133]The Department of Justice (DOJ) received hundreds of criticalpublic comments about the treatment of children as adults for purposes ofpublic notification.[134]Perhaps as a result, under the Supplemental SORNA Guidelines issued on January11, 2011, DOJ allowed “jurisdictions to use their discretion to exemptinformation concerning sex offenders required to register on the basis of ajuvenile delinquency adjudication from public Web site posting.”[135]However, as of January 2013, not one state previously deemed in compliance withSORNA went back to amend its laws to exempt children from public disclosure.[136]As of 2011, mostjurisdictions subjected children convicted of sex offenses in adult court tothe same community notification regimes as adult sex offenders.[137] Fourteen states apply the same notification standardsapplied to adults to both children convicted in adult court and childrenadjudicated delinquent of sex offenses.[138] Other states give judges some discretion over which youthsex offenders are subject to community notification. Some jurisdictions permityouths to petition to be removed after a number of years. In some states, ajuvenile adjudicated delinquent has to be 14 to be listed on publicsex-offender registries. In others, children may be eligible for public Internetcommunity notification at age 10, 11, or 12.[139] Handling of photographs varies as well bystate: some jurisdictions do not post the picture of children unless they reoffend,while others post the image of a child upon their initial registration at agesas young as 9, 10, 12, or 14.“Non-Public” NotificationEven in jurisdictions requiring disclosure of registryinformation only to law enforcement agencies (also known as“non-public” disclosure), a child’s information and picturecan be, and often is, still disseminated publicly. Members of the public canobtain information on non-public registrants upon request and, with a fewclicks of a button, widely disseminate a child’s photograph and personalinformation.Youth sex offender registrants interviewed for this report describedvarious ways in which their photographs and personal information were madepublic even when not posted on official state sex offender registration websites:Nicholas T. was placed on the registry atthe age of 16 for the attempted rape of a younger neighbor.[140] He stated that “a member of the community made flyers that said‘Beware – Sex Offender in the Neighborhood.’ The flyers, withmy grade school picture, offense, and address, were posted all over theplace.”[141]“My son, [Max B.], started registeringat the age of 10 when he was found guilty of inappropriately touching his 8-year-oldsister. The local police assured us that they would allow him to register as anon-public registrant until he turned 12. However, a few months after [Max]went on the registry, the local newspaper ran a Halloween story entitled‘Know where the Monsters are Hiding,’ warning families to beware ofthe registered sex offenders in the neighborhood when taking their little onesout to go trick-or-treating. The article listed all the sex offenders in ourtown. [Max’s] name and address was listed.”[142]The police in a small town in Illinoiscreated a “Wall of Shame” containing photographs, names, andaddresses of all the registered sex offenders in the area, including childregistrants and those deemed low-risk and subject to law-enforcementregistration only. People from the town frequently visit the police station tocheck out the wall of shame.[143]Official sex offender registration information is alsoavailable for purchase or use by private security companies, which sometimes createtheir own searchable web-based sex offender registries. Companies such asOffendex (also known as The Official Sex Offender Archive©) and HomeFacts(also known as RealtyTrac Holdings, LLC™) transfer all state sex offenderregistration information, including registrant pictures and addresses, to theirwebsites, iPhone/Droid Android applications, or Facebook, to be searched freelyby anyone. These companies appear to take no responsibility for deletingrecords of persons removed from the registry.[144] The Offendex website indicates that the company distinguishes itself fromofficial government records because it includes “both current and pastsex offender records nationwide.”[145]Stating that “[e]ven if the sex offender is not required to register thatdoes not mean the record itself goes away [sic]. The information is stillpublic and available through many court and private databasesnationwide.”[146]Click to expand ImageA newspaperclipping that a father retained regarding the location of sex offenders onHalloween. According to the law, on Halloween registered sex offenders must remaininside their homes, turn the porch light off, and place a sign in their yardthat states, “No candy at this residence.” Local police officersalso make home visits to ensure compliance. © 2013 Mariam Dwedar/Human Rights Watch.Maya R.Maya R., now age 28 and a resident of Michigan, was arrestedat the age of 10 for sexual experimentation. “Me and my step brothers, who were ages 8 and 5,‘flashed’ each other and play-acted sex whilefully-clothed.”[147] A year later, Maya pledguilty to the charges of criminal sexual conduct in the first and seconddegree, offenses that required her to register as a sex offender for25 years.[148]In court proceedings, Maya told the judge thatshe engaged in sexual activity with both boys. However, she says she lied incourt to get away from her stepmother.[149]Maya was committed to agirl’s juvenile prison and spent 18 monthsthere. “I successfully completed the treatment program and wasreleased back into the community.”[150] Upon her return, she says, she felt like a stranger. “[W]hen I wasarrested I was in the sixth grade. When I returned from prison I was in theninth grade. I was on probation from 1998 to 2002 while I attended highschool. I also wrote for my school’s newspaper, sang in the choir,performed in theatre, was involved with Students Against Drunk Driving(SADD), and was the president of Diversity Club.”[151]In 1999, when Maya turned 18, her photograph and name were added to thestate sex offender public website.[152] In Michigan all children, whether adjudicateddelinquent in juvenile court or tried as adults, must register.[153]While children adjudicated delinquent are still under 18 years of age,juvenile registration and included materials are exempt from the publicnotification requirements.[154]However, public registration is required when the child, adjudicatedfor certain sexual offenses, turns 18 years old.[155]As a result of being placed on the public registry, Mayawas fired from her job. “Despite the setback, I graduated high schoolin 2002 with academic and leadership honors and took the next step ofapplying to college,” she said.[156]In her freshman year of college, Maya lived in the campusdormitory. She says she “found angry messages taped to her dorm room doorand received threatening instant messages.”[157]She eventually had to move out of the dorm. “Evenmore stressful than students in the dorms telling me to ‘move out orelse,’ was the constant inability to find and keep employment.”[158]Maya moved into off campus housing but quicklyran out of money and could not get a job. Maya said shewas forced to drop out of college. “Without student loans to surviveoff of, I lived in a homeless shelter for about 90 days, I was told bymanagers at Subway, Burger King, and McDonalds, ‘We don’t hiresex-offenders,’ I was without a car, and also could not afford a cellphone.”[159]Maya told us,“Being on the registry has caused much stress and frustration in mylife. The laws make it very difficult for me locate places where I can live.Once while attempting to register my address, a police officer refused togive me the paperwork and instead stated, ‘We’re just taking yourkind out back and shooting them.’ This comment, coupled with not beingable to get an internship, or a job, all contributed to me falling into adepression, which still comes and goes depending on the discrimination Iexperience each day.”[160]Despite her the sex offender label, Maya continued to try to find ways to succeed. Sheworked as a missionary and taught English overseas. While abroad, she fell inlove and married a Filipino man. As of early 2013, Mayaand her husband were living in Michigan with a two-year-old girl and a babyboy on the way.Residency and Zoning RestrictionsOfficials in many jurisdictions have imposed residency andzoning restrictions on registered sex offenders, including children.[161]Local ordinances prohibit registrants from residing in or traveling within acertain distance of schools, day care centers, parks, and other locations wherechildren commonly congregate.[162]Yet research on the effectiveness of residency restrictions imposedon adult sex offenders offers no indication that these laws achieve theirintended goals of preventing abuse, protecting children, or reducingreoffending.[163] Forexample, recidivism by adult sex offenders is not more likely to occur nearschools.[164]Rather, abuses happen when adults are able to establish relationships withchildren and their families and misuse positions of familiarity, trust, andauthority[165]Children are most likely to be assaulted by people they know, not strangerslurking in schoolyards.In 2002, Iowaenacted a law that prohibits sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of aschool or daycare center. The executive director of the Iowa County AttorneysAssociation, Corwin R. Ritchie, said that the law “has overburdened lawenforcement, has concentrated sex offenders in areas where they are allowed tolive and has led to an increase in the number of sex offenders who have stoppedregistering with local authorities and gone missing.[166] Further, Ritchie contended, “I defyanyone to try and convince me, scientifically or logically that thoserequirements have any affect at all. It makes great sense politically, but hasno affect [sic] whatsoever on public safety.”[167]Because residency restrictions have such questionableutility in deterring offenses committed by adults, there is little reason toexpect they would deter children from committing sex offenses. Meanwhile, sexoffender residency restrictions have been shown to increase transience,homelessness, and instability.[168]Duration of RegistrationThe duration of registration required of youth offendersconvicted in adult court is, in most states, the same as that required ofadults. But children adjudicated delinquent are often subject to shorterrequirements or may petition to be removed from the registry. Federal SORNA,however, is changing the required minimum duration of registration, establishinga “tier” system based on the offense (whether criminal convictionor adjudication in juvenile court), with Tier I offenses having the lightestand Tier III the most stringent requirements. Under SORNA, children convictedof offenses categorized in Tier III are required to register for life. Thefollowing are two examples of youth offenders subject to lifetime registrationrequirements:In New Jersey in 1995, ten-year-old J.G.pled guilty in juvenile court to second-degree sexual assault of his cousin, aneight-year-old girl. J.G. received a suspended sentence on condition that heattend a family therapy program and not be left unsupervised with youngchildren. J.G. got into no further trouble. But 16 months after successfullycompleting treatment, J.G. was notified that under New Jersey’s newlyenacted “Megan’s Law,” he would be required to register withlocal police as a sex offender for the rest of his life.[169]In Texas, a juvenile court found ten-year-oldGabriel P. guilty of indecency with a child (touching) in an incident in whichhe and his two friends were playing with a seven-year-old cousin. He is subjectto lifetime registration.[170]Even when registration is limited in duration, youthoffender registrants can experience severe difficulties and high costs inpurging their information from the registry. One told Human Rights Watch,“My 10 years of registration was supposed to end on September 27, 2012.It is now 2013 and I am still on the state website and all those otherregistration sites. I feel like it will never end.”[171]Another told us, “Even though the lawstated that I was to be removed from the registry, I had to pay over $3,000 infees to have my name completely removed from all the various websites.”[172]V. Life on the RegistrySex offender registration andnotification laws impose harsh, sometimes debilitating, and often lifelongsanctions on children convicted or adjudicated guilty of sex offenses. Many ofthe individuals interviewed for this report described being placed in ajuvenile facility for a few years after being found guilty of the underlyingsex offense; those convicted as adults spend time in adult prison. When they returnto their communities as teenagers or young adults, they are alreadysignificantly behind their contemporaries in education, socialization,establishing stable family relations, and developing employment skills. Yet,required to register as sex offenders, they soon learn they face furtherobstacles that may be nearly impossible to overcome.As we document below, youth placed on registries are often ostracized,threatened, and subject to strict residency requirements. Many are in effectbanished from their neighborhoods, prevented from attending school, andsubjected to restrictions that “potentially permeate every aspect oftheir lives.”[173]The following sections offer a portrait of life as a youth sex offender growingup on the sex offender registry.Psychological ImpactStigmatization and IsolationAdolescence is a developmental period characterized byidentity formation.[174]Labels stick and can last a lifetime. The label of “sex offender,” “childmolester,” or “sexually violent predator” can cause profounddamage to a child’s development and self- esteem.[175]Stigmatization can also lead to fear or mistrust by others, suspicion,rejection, or isolation from family and friends.These harms are compounded by the shame that comes withregistration and notification, which often lacks an endpoint.[176]Subjecting alienated and confused youth sex offenders to long-term publichumiliation, stigmatization, and barriers to education and employmentexacerbates the psychological difficulties they already experience.Among the 281 youth offenders and family members of 15additional youth offenders interviewed for this report, most (250 people, or 84.5percent) described negative psychological impacts that they attributed to theirstatus as a registrant, such as depression, a sense of isolation, difficultyforming or maintaining relationships, and suicide ideation. Nearly a fifth ofthose interviewed (58 people, or 19.6 percent) said they had attempted suicide;three of the registrants whose cases we examined did commit suicide.The following are examples of the psychological harm youth offendersexperience:Christian W. was 14 years old when he wenton the registry for sexually inappropriately touching his younger cousin. Atage 26, Christian told Human Rights Watch, “I live in a general sense ofhopelessness, and combat suicidal thoughts almost daily due to the lifesentence [registration] and punishment of being a registrant. The stigma andshame will never fully go away, people will always remember. The consequenceswill always be there even if one could eventually get off the registry.”[177]“As a female, I feel like a piece ofmeat when I have to go update my registration. I think they assume that becauseI am on the registry I am easy.”[178]“He’s changed.… [H]e isangry and depressed. I’m afraid this shame and stigma is more than my soncan stand.”[179]“I have been registering since I was 12years old. I am now 26. Sex offender registration is slow death byhumiliation.”[180]“The police always expect you are theworst of the worst sex offenders and so they treat you that way. Most of themlook down on you as if you are the scum of the earth.”[181]A 16-year-old who has been on the registryin Louisiana for two years told us, “for sex offenders, our mistake isforever available to the world to see. There is no redemption, no forgiveness.You are never done serving your time. There is never a chance for a freshstart. You are finished. I wish I was executed because my life is basicallyover.”[182]Typically, children and adolescents have difficultynavigating close interpersonal relationships. Because of the stigma associatedwith sex offenders, registration laws place youth offender registrants’ personalrelationships “in grave jeopardy.”[183]For example, Dominic G. was placed on the registry for an offense committedwhen he was 13. Now age 22, he is still on the registry and on sex offenderparole, which means that anyone he wants to talk to, by phone or in person, is requiredto first fill out a form and obtain approval by his parole officer.[184]Another youth offender told Human Rights Watch, “I’m a ghost. I can’tput my name on a lease, I never receive mail. No one cares if I am alive. Infact, I think they would prefer me dead.”[185]The alienation that emerges from a system set up to regulatepersonal relationships can thwart healthy development in young people. Bycontrast, young people who are encouraged to connect with their communities andfamily members “build hope, a sense of control over one’senvironment, expectations for success in school and work,” and a chancefor healthier development.[186]SuicideHuman Rights Watch found that, left with little hope of everleading a normal life, some youth offenders on the registry opted for what theymay have viewed as the only remaining route of escape—suicide. One experttold us, “Suicide [among children placed on sex offender registries] is apossibility … even predictable.”[187]A registrant told Human Rights Watch, “I attemptedsuicide when I was 20 due to an article printed in the newspaper about my case.I was just a kid.”[188]Another said, “I sometimes pray that I won’t wake up the nextday.”[189] Athird said, “when I was 19 I slit both wrists. I would have bled to deathif my friend hadn’t found me.”[190]Parents described how their children were flooded by feelingsof despair when they realized that the “sex offender” label wouldstay with them forever, regardless of whether their name could be found on thestate registry. One child was adjudicated delinquent for a sex offense at age 11.At the age of 17 he took his own life. His mother explained, “Under thelaw at the time he was looking at being put on the public registry when heturned 18. His picture, address and information on the Web…. He justcouldn’t bear it.”[191]Another young man who was placed on the registry at age 12committed suicide at age 17, a few months after Michigan passed a law to removeoffenders who were under 14 at the time of the offense from the registry. Hismother said “Everyone in the community knew he was on the sex offenderregistry, it didn’t matter to them that he was removed … the damagewas already done. You can’t un-ring the bell.”[192]The mother of a former registrant told Human Rights Watchabout the circumstances that led to her son, Carson E., taking his own life in2008. Adjudicated delinquent at the age of 13 for rape, he successfullycompleted sex offender treatment and as a result was later removed from thepublic registry and subject to law-enforcement-only registration. But nearly 10years after his offense, he started facing serious difficulties. Carson’smother reports that during college he was denied housing and employment due tohis status, which was revealed during criminal background checks. At the age of25, and within weeks of graduating from college, Carson committed suicide. Hismother says she knows in her heart that he killed himself because upongraduation, he was going to look for professional work and knew his backgroundwould come up in every job interview.[193]Dominic G.Dominic G. was living in Texas when Human Rights Watchinterviewed him in 2012. In 2006, when he was 15 years old, Dominic wascharged with having molested his sister when he was approximately 14 and shewas approximately 12. Dominic denied the allegations. In 2007, after Dominichad spent over a year going back and forth between a psychiatric hospital andjail, his defense attorney told Dominic and his mother that if he did notadmit to the allegations, he would be transferred to adult court and face upto 20 years in prison. Grace N., Dominic’s grandmother, said Dominiclater told her, “Grandma, I didn’t know what to say.”Dominic admitted to the allegations by entering a plea in December 2007 andwas committed to the Texas Youth Commission (the Texas juvenile detentionsystem).While in detention, Dominic received honors and was knownfor his artistic skill. By the age of 17 he was granted special permission toattend college courses off campus. He was able to work and earn money.Dominic’s mother died in 2009, when he was 18, and his younger brotherand sister have lived with his maternal grandmother, Grace, ever since. InApril 2012, at the age of 21, Dominic was released from detention and placedon parole under the jurisdiction of the adult criminal court until the year2037.In December 2012, Dominic’s sister came home andbroke down crying to her grandmother. Grace told Human Rights Watch that theyoung woman “was sobbing hysterically, screaming ‘Don’thate me. Don’t hate me.’ Then finally she said, ‘I made thewhole story up about Dominic, he never touched me. They kept telling me thatI was going to go to jail if I didn’t tell the storyright.’”[194]Dominic is subject to sex offender registration andnotification requirements. Shortly before his release on parole, Dominic metwith a parole officer who gave him “stacks of papers and rules to readand sign.”[195]Dominic was told that he was being placed on “Condition X”parole, which requires him to register as a sex offender.[196]Among other conditions, he must:Not participate in any volunteeractivities without prior written approval of the parole officer;Not enroll in or attend any institution ofhigher learning, including a community college, without prior parole boardapproval and notification to the victims of “the sex offense”;Not view, possess, purchase, or subscribeto any photographs, literature, magazines, books, or visual media that depictsexually explicit images;Submit to polygraph examinations asapproved by the parole officer and board;Not attend any program that includesparticipants who are 17 years of age or younger or go within 500 feet of anyplace that children commonly gather, including schools, day care facilities,playgrounds, and public swimming pools;Not become involved in dating, marriage,or platonic relationships with anyone who has children 17 years old oryounger without the written approval of the parole officer;Not reside with, have unsupervised contactwith, or cause to be contacted by any child 17 years or younger (other thanhis own children, should he have any) in person or by telephone,correspondence, or video or audio device ;Not own, maintain, or operate computerequipment without written authorization from the parole officer;Not own, maintain, or operate photographicequipment, including still photos, videos, or any electronic imagingequipment unless approved in writing by the parole officer; andSubmit to a search of the person, motorvehicle, place of residence, and property, without a warrant at any time, dayor night.During the pre-release meeting, Dominic also had to sign aCollateral Contact Form, which required him to identify a contact to assistin monitoring his behavior. The form states that this person may be, forexample, a roommate, employer, family member, spouse, significant other,pastor, sponsor, or friend. Dominic specified his maternal grandmother,Grace. But Grace was told that she can never have Dominic in her home becausehis sister, the victim, resides there.In early January 2013, Dominic tried to commit suicide.Grace said “he slashed his wrists and I knew I had to call his paroleofficer to get permission to take him to the hospital.”[197]Even though it was an emergency, the parole officer threatened to arrestDominic for violating parole if he was not brought to the parole office firstto sign papers before going to the hospital.[198]Grace took her bleeding grandson to the parole office, parked the car, andran inside so she could sign the papers. The parole officers demanded thatshe bring Dominic from the car into the office so that he could sign thepapers. After a stressful few minutes, a parole officer came out and toldGrace that she could take Dominic to the hospital.[199]Dominic remained in the hospital for nearly two weeks.[200]Violent AttacksLaws that place youth offenders onsex offender registries expose them to vigilante attacks and are at odds withexisting state laws that protect the confidentiality of juvenile records.Among the 296 cases examined for this report, 154 (52 percent) youth offenders experiencedviolence or threats of violence against themselves or family members that theydirectly attributed to their registration. For example:Isaac E. has been on the registry since hewas 12 years old, after pleading guilty to a charge of “indecentliberties by forcible compulsion” for touching the chest of a girl. Thevictim of his offense, a female classmate, was also 12. Isaac states that thestate registry does not provide information about the date of conviction forthe sex offense, and updates the age of the registrant each year.[201]As time passes, this makes people who committed sex offenses as children looklike adult sex offenders. If someone looks Isaac up on the registry, unless theytake the time to find out that the offense was committed nearly 15 years earlier,it appears as if he is an adult who sexually assaulted a 12-year-old child. Isaacsays “it is very misleading and makes people very angry. My brother, wholooks like me, was once harassed and nearly beaten to death by a drunk neighborwho thought he was me.”[202]Bruce W. is the father of two sons placed onregistry at ages 10 and 12 for the same offense committed against their youngersister, then age 8. He says that a man once held a shotgun to his 10-year-oldson’s head.[203]Camilo F. was placed on the registry at age 14.He says strange cars started following him home from school. “One time aman from one of those cars yelled ‘child molester’ at me.”[204]Camilo said a week later several bullets were fired from a car driving by.“The bullets went through the living room window as my family and mewatched TV.”[205]Carson E., from northern Washington, startedregistering at the age of 13. For the first few years, his picture was on thepublic website. During this time, he faced harassment and threats from hispeers at school. At one point when he was in ninth grade, Carson was beatenseverely by some people in the area, his mother recalled. Despite pleading fromhis parents, Carson refused to file a report with the police.[206]“Neighbors harassed our family. Welater found out that one of the neighbors shot our family dog,” said themother of one registrant.[207]Terrance W. was placed on the sex offenderregistry for an offense committed when he was 14. He said, “I fear for myfather’s life since I live with him. The registry is being used more andmore as a publicly available hit list for vigilantes to murder or assault thoseon the registry.”[208]Click to expand ImageFamilyphotos of two boys at ages 10 and 8 (now adults in their late twenties) whowere subject to sex offender registration for offenses committed at ages 12and 10. Individuals aware of their registration have thrown molotov cocktailsthrough the window of the family home, as well as threatened, insulted, andshouted profanities at all members of the family. Weatherford, Texas, May 1,2012. © 2012 Nicole PittmanOther registrants experienced harassment as a result oftheir registration status. One female youth sex offender explained, “I wason the public registry at age 11 for the offense of unlawful sexual contact.They thought I was not a virgin. Random men called my house wanting to‘hook up’ with me.”[209]A male youth offender living in Texas recounted severalincidents of harassment: “I was in the [school] parking lot and thistruck drove by and started throwing beer bottles at me. I had to run inside.They yelled, ‘Get out of our school, you child molester! I wish I couldkill you!’” Another time, he says, he was approached by a man who said,“that’s my house over there and those are my kids and if you evercome near my house, I’m gonna blow your brains out.” The male youthsex offender also told us that “multiple people had said they planned onthrowing me off the town water tower.”[210]Impacton FamiliesRegistration laws can have a severe impact on the familiesof registrants.[211]Among the 296 youth offender registrants whose cases were examined for thisreport, 76.7 percent said their registration status had serious repercussions fortheir families and family relationships. These included, among others, addingto the family’s economic challenges, difficulty in securing ormaintaining an approved residence, and straining or severing familyrelationships.Young people exiting custody in the juvenile justice systemor adult prisons are often discharged back to families already struggling withdomestic violence, substance abuse, mental health issues, unemployment, andpoverty.[212]Plans are rarely in place to support youth when they return to their families.Children face unemployment, school enrollment challenges, and sometimeshomelessness upon release.[213]The impact may be more pronounced for families with childrensubject to sex offender registration requirements. “Withparents often the targets of blame for the sins of their children, parents ofsex offenders can experience just as much fear, shame and paranoia as theirchildren,” social worker David Prescott said.[214]Many registrants and family members told Human Rights Watchabout the stresses placed on families as a result of registration. Theseinclude the following examples:Luna L. has two sons on the sex offenderregistry stemming from the same offense: sexual battery, or inappropriatetouching, of a 10-year-old foster child who lived in their home. The brothers,Camilo F. and Julián C., were ages 14 and 16 at the time of the offense.Luna had to petition the local government to make an exception for her youngboys to return to her house after their release from juvenile detention. Stilltoday, six years after her sons were arrested, Luna worries about thepossibility they will be arrested if they do not come home before curfew. Shesays she cannot sleep until both arrive home from 12-hour workdays asrestaurant managers, before their 11 p.m. curfew.[215]One young man who spoke to Human RightsWatch, Ignacio P., was six years old when his brother Fernando P., then 12, wasplaced on the sex offender registry for allegedly molesting a child in theneighborhood. In 2011, after registering as a sex offender for nearly 14 years,Fernando was acquitted of the sex offense and removed from the registry whenthe neighbor recanted the allegations. Ignacio, who is now 20 years old, initiallydescribed being a sibling of a child registrant as “easy,” but thensaid his parents were so “consumed with fighting to help Fernando thatthey ignored me. I was invisible. I could do anything and not get in trouble... as long as I didn’t get arrested.”[216]In 2008, Julián C.was adjudicateddelinquent of sexual battery of a child for an offense that occurred when hewas 16 and the victim was 10 years old. The offense involved penetration of thechild victim, who was a foster child living in the home at the time. Juliánwas committed to a juvenile prison and, once released, was required to attendsex offender treatment, placed on an electronic monitor, and sentenced to sixyears’ on adult sex offender probation. At the time Human Rights Watchinterviewed Julián, he was still on probation while working full timeand attending classes at a local college in Jacksonville, Florida. Juliánlives at home with his mother, father, brother, and the brother’s fiancée.Julián’s brother and fiancée were expecting a baby girl inNovember 2012. Probation told Julián that he would need to move from thehome when the baby was born, or that his brother, fiancée, and the baby wouldneed to live elsewhere. The family challenged this condition in court. Eachmember of the household had to sign a five-page document explaining that thebaby would never be alone with Julián. The Judge granted the exceptionand Julián was allowed to remain at home with his family.[217]A youth sex offender who was placed on theregistry at age 14 explained, “because of sex offender restrictions myfamily had to be divided up. I could not live with children. My father stayedin our house with my younger brother. My mother and me moved in with mygrandparents 2 hours away.”[218]Families also suffer as a result of the public stigmaassociated with the registration status of their loved one. One youth sexoffender explained, “A neighbor put a sign on our lawn saying ‘theState let a 13 year old rapist go free and he lives here.’”[219]Financial BurdensParents of registrants reported experiencing increasedfinancial burdens from the moment their child was placed on the registry. Somefamily members of registrants lost their jobs as a result of the sex offenderregistration status of their family member. “I was a principal of aschool. I lost my job when the school district found out that I had a youngchild on the registry.”[220]The fees associated with registration can be prohibitivelyhigh for a young person. These expenses often fall on the family, especiallywhen the individual on the registry is a dependent child. Depending on thejurisdiction and the registrant’s classification level, initialregistration fees can cost anywhere between $50 and several hundred dollars peryear. In the state of Louisiana, Human Rights Watch documented a case (see textbox “James” below) in which registration fees and costs associatedwith registration totaled just over $1,000 annually. The fees associated with registrationcan be prohibitively high for a young person. These expenses often fall on thefamily, especially when the individual on the registry is a dependent child. Dependingon the jurisdiction and the registrant’s classification level,   initialregistration fees can cost anywhere between $800 and $1,200 and total upwardsof $2,000 per year.Click to expand ImageJackson D., at age 12, near his home in Garland, Texas, theyear he was placed on the sex offender registry. © 2012 Nicole Pittman.Jackson D., who has been registering as a sex offender sincehe was 12 years old, said, “my mom had to pay my fees. I was too young towork. If you don’t pay, they re-arrest you and convict you for failure toregister.”[221] Jacksonturned 23 on the day we interviewed him. He still lives with his mother. Hestruggles to keep jobs to help his mother prevent the house from going intoforeclosure.Childrenof Registered Sex OffendersThe effects of registration can touch later generations ofchildren as well. Many of the individuals we spoke with were placed on theregistry as children but are now married with children of their own. Offenderregistration laws can have especially harmful impacts on the children ofregistrants. A 2009 study found that 75 percent of the children of registrantshad lost friendships as a result of a parent’s status as a registered sexoffender. Additionally, 59 percent reported that other children at schooltreated them differently when it was discovered that they had a parent on theregistry.[222]Another study found that a Kentucky policy restricting registered sex offenderparents from attending their children’s school functions interfered withtheir parenting role and could have serious deleterious consequences for theentire family.[223]Children of registrants reportedly experience adverse consequences includingstigmatization, violence, harassment, and differential treatment by teachersand classmates. In one instance, a teenage girl in Texas shot herself to deathafter her father’s photo appeared on the state Internet registry,embarrassing her at school.[224]Most youth offender registrants with children we spoke withhad very young children who had not yet attained school age. We were able,however, to interview a few school-age children with a parent on the registry.These children reported being treated differently or teased because of theirparent’s registration status.Hunter E. said he was sad that his father was on the sexoffender registry. He added that “everyone at school knows my father is aregistered sex offender,” and he feels like his classmates and teachers“look at him strangely.”[225] At age11, Hunter is the same age his father was when he was arrested for the sexoffense that placed him on the registry.Mark O. is a registered sex offender for having had sexualintercourse when he was 17 years old with his 15-year-old girlfriend.[226]He was placed on the sex offender registry after he signed the birthcertificate of the daughter he fathered with that girlfriend. Years later,after Mark and his no-longer-underage partner married and had a second child,their first daughter was mortified when a teacher warning her class about sexualpredators punched the school’s ZIP code into the online sex offender registryand her dad’s name came up. Her parents had told her that her dadwas on the sex offender registry, “but it wasn't something the wholeclass knew, until then.”[227]A 10-year-old child, Cindy D., said she can never have abirthday party at her own house. “I cannot bring my friends here becausemy father cannot be around other children,” she said.[228]Cindy’s father was 14 when he had consensual sex with his 13-year-oldgirlfriend. In Delaware, where they live, a child under 14 years of age cannotlegally give consent. Cindy’s father is now 28 years old and has not beenin trouble with the law since, but because he is a registered sex offender, hecannot have unsupervised contact with children under the age of 18.We asked both non-registered and registered parents todescribe ways that their children have been directly affected by sex offenderregistration laws. They reported that because of various restrictions, theregistered parent is unable to participate in most of the child’sactivities such as attending a school play, going to sporting events, andattending their child’s birthday party. Individuals placed on theregistry for offenses committed over a decade ago, when they were children,cannot even pick up their own children at school.Jerry M. was placed on the registry for an offense hedescribes as “sexual play during ‘truth or dare’ with youngerkids when I was 11 years old.”[229]Now as a parent in his late twenties, Jerry says “I worry about my twolittle children, ages 4 and 2, having to live in a publicly identified houseand having to pay this lifelong price for something that happened years beforethey were born. I want to be involved in their lives but I also want them to beable to live free to be who they are without having to carry such aburden.”[230]One girl with a father on the sex offender registry wroteHuman Rights Watch a letter about her life as a child of a registered sexoffender. The young woman did not want her name or location identified in thisreport for “fear it would put us in more danger,” but she wrote,I would like to take the time to tell you what it is liketo be a child of a [registered] sex offender. I wake up every morning wonderinghow many [sex offender] signs may be on our front lawn; how many people aregoing to ride by our house, point, and take pictures; how many people are goingto watch every move we make today; and how many times people are going to callthe police to report that my parent has done something for which an averageperson would be normal but because my parent is a known “SexOffender” its suspicious behavior how many more birthdays will be withjust family because other parents will not let their kids come to my party; howmany parties will I not be invited to [sic]; how many more sports gameswill my parent not be allowed to watch me play; and how many field trips will Inot attend because it is too hard to listen to the whispers of the otherparents?[231]HousingLocal lawmakers have passedmunicipal ordinances prohibiting individuals on sex offender registries fromresiding or traveling within close proximity to places where children commonlycongregate. Given the large number of parks, schools, daycare centers, andplaygrounds in some cities, there can be very few places where sex offenderscan live.In one study, adult registrants cited difficulties in findinghousing and being forced to move as the most common problems resulting fromtheir registrant status.[232]A study conducted in Orange County, Florida found that the law banningindividuals on the sex offender registry from living within 1,000 feet of aschool, daycare, or bus stop would allow them to reside in less than fourpercent of the county.[233]In Miami-Dade County, Florida, which has a 1,750-foot residency restriction,affordable housing is nearly nonexistent.[234]In Kentucky, a study showed that 45 percent of individuals registering foradult sex offenses reported a loss of housing or inability to find housing.[235]A Wisconsin study revealed that 83 percent of the adult registrants had troublefinding and/or maintain housing.[236]In South Carolina, one study found that nearly half of all the houses in thestate would be restricted under the local 1,000-foot restriction zone.[237]Studies show that adolescents and young adults on sexoffender registries have an even harder time securing housing than older adultson registries.[238] Of the296 youth offender registrants whose cases were examined for this report, over44 percent (132 respondents) told us they had experienced at least one periodof homelessness as a result of the restrictions that come with beingregistered.Aaron I., who is on the registry in Florida for an offensecommitted at the age of 15, constantly struggles to find housing for himselfand his wife. “I have found a few places to rent but as soon as we movein the police and neighbors harass us until we get evicted. They keep ushomeless. I am banned from living in a homeless shelter. It is impossible tomeet these expectations.”[239]Another youth offender said, “It really never ends. Currently I amhomeless … for something that happened when I was 12 years old.”[240]The majority of parents with a child on the registry interviewedby Human Rights Watch reported having trouble providing shelter for theirfamily due to residency restrictions requiring the child registrant to live acertain distance from schools, parks, playgrounds, daycare centers, or bus stops.And once they are living on their own, registrants face similar challenges inprocuring housing. For example:Audrey R. faced a choice between keeping ahouse she owned and living with her 14-year-old son, who was on the sexoffender registry for inappropriately touching an 8-year-old girl Audrey hadbeen babysitting. Audrey sent her son to live in another county with relativeswhile she tried to sell her house.[241]Luna L. said that the Florida Department ofJuvenile Justice told her that her son, who had been adjudicated delinquent atage 14, would not be allowed to live in her house because it was too close to aschool. She contested this decision and won. But Luna’s voice cracked asshe recalled, “my son had to stay in jail an additional year while wefought to get my house approved.”[242]David H., a foster child living with afoster family in Michigan, was found guilty of a sex offense that required himto start registering at the age of 13.[243] He wasaccused of fondling his foster parents’ young daughter. David completedtreatment and therapy and later went on to college. At the beginning of hisfirst semester in college, David was arrested for failure to register. Davidwas charged not because he failed to update his record with his college addressbut because he failed to inform the State Police that he was attending aninstitution of higher learning. He simply did not know he needed to inform thepolice of his attendance on campus. Failure to register is a felony punishableby up to four years in prison.[244]Public housing authorities can also evict the family of achild on the sex offender registry. The federal Office of Housing and UrbanDevelopment allows local housing authorities to terminate assistance to anentire family if any member of the household is arrested or adjudicateddelinquent of certain sex offenses.[245]Because state registration, notification, and residencyrestrictions often stipulate that offenders may not live in or near the homesof victims, housing issues can become extremely complicated when the victim ofa youth offender registrant is a sibling. In these instances, parents are facedwith a horrible choice between which of their children to keep in the home.Some parents are forced to place a child with a relative or family friend, or toplace a child in the care of the state.Lucas W. was 17 when he was arrested and adjudicateddelinquent of aggravated sexual assault for having consensual sex with hisyounger girlfriend, Emma J. Lucas was given five years deferred adjudicationfor the sexual offense. Later, he and Emma married. But Lucas was subsequently arrestedtwice for violations of probation. He described a “vicious cycle” wherebyhe was unable to find a job due to his status as a sex offender or a place for hisfamily to live that complied with residency restrictions, and thus could notafford his registration and mandatory therapy fees.[246]In 2000, Lucas was arrested for failure to register andsubsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison. While incarcerated, his wife gavebirth to their daughter. Emma, who refused to help prosecutors nearly 15 yearsago, said that “[Lucas] has always been my true love but the registrationlaws have taken a toll on all of [us].”[247]Emma took their daughter to visit Lucas regularly during his entireincarceration. In 2009, Lucas was finally released from prison to a halfwayhouse where he was to remain until he could find proper housing. But he hadproblems finding suitable housing outside of the city’s sprawling childsafety zones, and as a result, Lucas had to remain apart from Emma and theirdaughter for yet another year.Lewis A.At the age of 14, Lewis A. was adjudicated delinquent ofcriminal sexual contact in the first degree and was placed in a juveniletreatment facility for about a year. Upon his release, Lewis was made a wardof the state and placed in foster care because his Dad said he could notmanage him. At the age of 18, he no longer qualified for foster care and wason his own.Upon release from foster care, Lewis contacted IsabellaD., a grade school teacher who knew him before his arrest. “I was hisspecial education teacher before this happened in a classroom for studentsclassified as having cognitive impairments (mental retardation.) When he gotout of foster care he managed to find me and I have tried to help him get hislife back on track as much as possible,” said Isabella.[248]When HumanRights Watch first interviewed Lewis, he was just 18 years old and had spentnearly nine months homeless in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He survived the previouswinter by living in an abandoned building. “It used to be a restaurant,maybe 15 years ago, it was a boarded up abandoned building with no runningwater.”[249]Isabella and another teacher helpedLewis by giving him places to shower and wash his clothes.Isabella describes her former student as “a sweetand honest young man who is very vulnerable.”[250]Isabella worked with Lewis to get him assessed with a disability so that hecould get some services. The results of his IQ test helped him qualify foradult educational services, $200 monthly in social security benefits, $200monthly in food stamps, and a housing voucher. The voucher, through MichiganRehabilitation Services, helped with the rent, but it took months to find anapartment that would (1) accept the voucher and (2) rent to a registered sexoffender. As the voucher ran out they had to apply for an extension to getmore time to look for housing. Finally in August 2012, Lewis moved into hisown apartment. He also enrolled in an adult program and was working towardsgetting his GED.Lewis was supposed to spend Thanksgiving 2012 withIsabella and her family, but he decided to spend the weekend with his father.Immediately after the holiday, Lewis was arrested for vandalizing a cemeterywith some older men. Lewis’ housing voucher was revoked and he lost hisapartment. In December 2012, Lewis pled guilty to the vandalism charge andhas since served his time. But he still sits in jail. As a registered sexoffender, Lewis cannot be released from jail until he has a permanentaddress. Lewis cannot live in public assisted housing because he is aregistered sex offender.Isabella has tried to help get Lewis shelter and madereferrals to shelters and other agencies. She recently contacted agenciesthat assist individuals with mental disabilities and was told that allreferrals must come from the community mental health center. The communitymental health center will not consider making a referral until it can conductintake, i.e., until Lewis is out of jail and center staff can meet with himin person. Isabella said, “it is impossible to find him housing. Idon’t know how he is ever going to be released from jail.… We arescrambling, he has no place to go.”[251]Isabella and the other teacher still visit Lewis everyweek in jail. She told us, “I do understand that he is 18 years old andis responsible for his own actions but he is a young man with a disabilitywho was removed from his home at the age of 14.”[252]Even though Michigan law does not subject juvenilesadjudicated as young as Lewis to public notification, it is very difficultfor him to live day-to-day. “He will never show up on the registrybecause he was 14 when he committed his offense, but life is still one messafter another. He can’t get housing, a job, pay his fees.”[253]At the time this report was written, Lewis remained in jail, unable to bereleased without a residence and unable to get a residence because he is injail.Restrictions on MovementIn addition to residency restrictions, most jurisdictionsalso impose “no loitering/child safety zones” around schools,playgrounds, parks, daycare centers, and other locations where childrencongregate. Essentially, these restrictions ban registrants from passingthrough certain areas of the city.Interviewees reported having to map out routes before travelinganywhere. For example, Blake G., originally from Connecticut, was arrested atthe age of 15.[254]His crime was having a sexual relationship with his 13-year-old girlfriend.[255]Since his girlfriend was under the age of consent, Blake was charged as anadult for a sexual offense and subsequently placed on the sex offenderregistry. Shortly after the conviction, Blake’s parents moved the familyfrom Connecticut to a new state. Blake was required to register as a sexoffender in the new state. The county where Blake and his family moved to alsohad stringent residency and zoning restrictions. Blake, who is still a minor,is banned from being “within 300 feet of a place where children regularlycongregate, including but not limited to, a school, day care center,playground, park, or bus stop.”[256]Blake described the difficulty he faces navigating his new city, saying,“I have to look at a map before I walk anywhere. I can be arrested if Iam walking anywhere near a school or park.”[257]Blake’s mother said she thinks her son is afraid to leave the house.There are also strict restrictionson the presence of registrants near bus stops. Bus stops are plentiful and notwell-defined. In rural areas, school bus stops are not marked or labeled andare often at the end of a driveway or any designated location where the schoolbus picks up a child. In Orange County, Florida, where the law prohibits aregistered sex offender from residing within 2,500 feet of a school bus stop,day care center, park, or school, researchers mapped residential parcels ofland and found that 99.6 percent of parcels were located within 2,500 feet of abus stop.[258]Travel or Moving to AnotherJurisdictionBecause they live with their parents or other adultcaregivers, children and very young adults have little control over where theylive. Since there is no uniformity among the various states’registration and notification laws, registration becomes even more complex andonerous when a registrant travels or moves to a new jurisdiction. States differas to which offenses trigger registration, and state systems do a very poor jobof working together to ensure registrants who travel are treated fairly.For example, Elijah B. started registering at age 16. Whenhe moved to Texas, he transferred his registration from Flint, Michigan toHouston. A few years later, Elijah met his wife. Both were working and theylived together in a new apartment. Elijah explained to Human Rights Watch,One day while I was at work, the police pulled up in anunmarked car and placed me in the back of the car. Everyone at my job wascoming to see me get arrested. Then my general manger made a point to come andpublicly fire me in front of everyone because I’m labeled a“so-called sex offender.” I was extradited from Texas to Michigan,handcuffed in a van going state to state picking up other inmates in otherstates…. It took a full week to get to Flint. I sat in jail for threemonths accused of failing to register in Michigan. I was finally released whenthey realized that I was no longer required to update my address in Michiganbecause I was a resident of Texas and registered properly there.[259]After his release, Elijah had to find his own way home tohis wife in Texas.When a person has an out-of-state conviction oradjudication, most states require registration which is “comparable,similar, or substantially similar to” a listed registerableoffense. However, all too often state registration systems treatindividuals convicted of sexual offenses in other states differently fromindividuals convicted of the same offenses within the state. For instance, in Florida, “exposing the genitalsin a lewd or lascivious manner” is a sexual offense requiringregistration.[260] In Alabama, however, this offense is not a felony,and if committed by an Alabama resident would not trigger Alabama’sregistration requirements. However, Alabama law would require a Floridaresident who committed the same crime to register as a sex offender if he movesto Alabama.[261]Interferencewith EducationSince registered sex offenders are often banned from beingnear schools, registration can have an immediate impact on a youth offender’sschool attendance and educational opportunities.Children can find their access to education curtailed evenbefore they begin registering. Many children convicted of sexual offenses areexpelled from public school.[262] Often,the school’s code of conduct allows students to be disciplined in schoolfor behavior that occurs outside of school and off school grounds. In mostjurisdictions, discipline can take the form of suspension, expulsion, or alternativeschool placement, any of which can affect the quality of the student’seducation and access to higher education opportunities.[263]In some jurisdictions, certain charges brought against a child can lead theschool district to place the student in an alternative education program even withoutan adjudication of delinquency.[264]Crimes committed on school groundscan have immediate consequences in many states. For example, in Delaware, ifpolice find probable cause to believe a child committed a crime at school, thestudent must be immediately suspended and referred to alternative services.[265] The Delaware attorney general also “reportsany serious crimes committed off school grounds directly to schools.”[266]Among the 296 youth offender registrants whose cases wereexamined for this report, a majority (52.4 percent, or 154 respondents) statedthat they had been denied access to or experienced severe interruptions intheir primary or secondary education as a result of their registration. Othershad difficulties in school because of the public nature of their registrationstatus. One youth offender said, “Someone in my high school made flyersof my registration page. They taped them all over the school.”[267]Another said, “This all started in 2003 when I was 12 years old. Ididn’t go back to regular school until 10th grade. By then it was toolate and I was terrified everyone would find out I was a registered sexoffender. I dropped out but later got my GED.”[268]Registration can negatively affect a child’s access tohigher education. Most applications for higher education require informationabout the applicant’s criminal convictions.[269]While individuals generally do not need to disclose juvenile delinquencyadjudications because they are not criminal convictions, registration laws requirethat they do so if the delinquency involves sexual offenses. Severalindividuals we spoke with believe this has negatively affected their collegeadmissions.OngoingEconomic ConsequencesEmploymentThe most commonly reported consequence of registration foradult sex offenders is difficulty finding and maintaining employment.[270]While most employment applications, like college applications, requestinformation about the applicant’s criminal convictions, not juvenileadjudications, sex offender registration status must be disclosed by jobapplicants regardless of whether the individual was adjudicated delinquent orconvicted in adult court. Individuals we interviewed said that theirregistration status for offenses committed as children decades ago continues tolimit their job opportunities.Certain institutions, including public schools, child carecenters, and nursing homes, are legally required to investigate and obtaincriminal histories of all applicants for professional or certified licensed positions.[271]State laws prohibit individuals on the sex offender registry from applying forlicenses and certifications which require a criminal background check, thusprecluding registrants from becoming nurses, doctors, lawyers, and emergencymedical technicians such as paramedics. Somestates implement blanket laws to prevent registered sex offenders fromobtaining certain types of employment or volunteer positions.[272] In addition to the obvious prohibitions, such as onworking at a school or day care center, some states have sought to limitemployment in other areas, such as operating an ice cream truck or a schoolbus; working at a carnival, circus, street fair, amusement park, or long-termcare facility; or serving as an athletic coach, manager, or trainer.[273]Maya R., whose case isprofiled in section IV above,  was arrested and charged with a sexualoffense at age 10 for an incident in which she and her stepbrothers, then ages 8 and 5, “flashed” each otherand play-acted sex while fully-clothed.[274] A year later, Maya pledguilty to the charges of criminal sexual conduct in the first and second degree,offenses that required her to register as a sex offender for 25 years. Maya also spent nearly four years at a juvenileprison. She said, “My experiences in a juvenile prison helped motivate meto want to become a social worker. Beingpart of the juvenile justice system, made me determined to prove that withdetermination, love, and a little support, productive citizens can emerge.[275] I could not believe how many younggirls in the facility were lost and without one caring family member. Manygirls in there were forced into prostitution by a parent.”[276]Upon release from prison, Mayapersevered and overcame the barriers inherent in being on the registry tograduate from high school, obtain a Bachelorof Arts degree in both social work and comparative religion, and earn a Mastersin Social Work (MSW) degree.[277]In 2011, a year after she got her MSW, Maya was relievedof her duty to register under a newly passed Michigan law.[278]Mayawas on track to get her social work license, but background checks and oldinformation on the internet revealed she was once on the registry. “I was first accepted for and then refused an internship witha great organization. This was my dream placement, but most agencies andorganizations in my field have polices that don’t allow the employment ofindividuals on the sex offender registry. I have been refused internships bycountless other organizations because of being on the public registry,” Maya stated.[279] She losther internship and has been unemployed since. Despite being 16 yearsremoved from her only arrest and despite having been taken off the registry,the stigma remains. Maya is hopeful that shewill one day complete an internship, become a licensed social worker, andrealize her dream of helping homeless individuals.[280]Elijah B. said, “I get hired and fired from so manyjobs. I can usually keep a job for a few weeks until the employer’s name andaddress goes up on the sex offender registry [because registrants must providethis information]. Employers say its ‘bad for business’ to keep meon. I accumulate about 20 W-2 forms at the end of each year.”[281]Another registrant told Human Rights Watch, “Working for the citycleaning out tunnels with acid was the only job I could get for a while.”[282]A third said, “employment is difficult. I have to support my wife andkids. I estimate that between January to April 2012 I have applied for 250positions.”[283]Registration Feesand Associated CostsMany states require sex offenders to pay a one-time initialregistration fee. For example, Colorado imposes a registration fee of between$150 and $400, depending on the seriousness of the sex offense.[284]California imposes a fee of $300 on registrants.[285]New York state charges a $50 registration fee,[286]Indiana charges $50, andOhio charges $100 per year.[287] An Illinois law requiresregistrants to subsidize the sex offender registration process by paying a feeof $100 to the local police department.[288]A registrant must keep the registration current in eachjurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee, or is a student, byappearing in-person at least once a year. Certain fees and costs related toregistration can be assessed at each appearance. States often impose additionalcosts on registrants, some of which are imposed on all persons convicted ofoffenses of a particular severity (such as all felons) in the state. Forexample, New York state imposes a mandatory surcharge of $300 on personsconvicted of felonies, a crime victim assistance fee of $25, a DNA databank feeof $50, a sex offender registration fee of $50, as well as (for certain crimes,including incest) a supplemental sex offender victim fee of $1,000.[289]Given the challenges many registrants face in finding employment, registrationfees and associated costs can be extremely difficult or impossible to pay.A youth sex offender in Texas said, “The fees areimpossible to pay. The first year I received a bill to pay $461 for courtcosts, $2,500 fine, $50 crimestoppers. That’s $3,000! If you don’tpay it you go back to jail for failure to register.”[290]In Louisiana, attorney Ethan Ashley explained the seriouseconomic hurdles his clients face in paying registration fees and associatedcosts, which can total more than $1,000 (see text box “James,”below): “The fees associated with registering as a sex offender inLouisiana are absurd. It would be hard for an individual who works a full-timejob to be able to manage these types of fees and the demands of registering ingeneral.”[291]JamesO.James O. was sentenced at age 15 to life without thepossibility of parole for aggravated rape in 1979. He spent 27 years and 8months in prison, primarily at Angola State Penitentiary. He was releasedfrom prison at the age of 44, after the Supreme Court ruled in Graham v.Florida that the sentence of life without parole was unconstitutional forjuveniles convicted of non-homicide offenses. James was required to registeras a sex offender within three days of release from prison. He was alsorequired to:Obtain a valid driver’s license andstate identification card, printed with the words “sex offender.”Each document cost him $20.Pay fees associated with communitynotification within 21 days of registration. During that time,registrants’ living arrangements and addresses are verified.Notifications are broken down into two categories:Postcard notification—Registrantsmust send a postcard with their photograph, address, offense, and personalinformation to every address within a 0.3 mile radius of their residence, ifliving within the city of New Orleans. It cost James, who was living in NewOrleans, $744 to send out postcards. Attorney Ethan Ashley noted, “Youcan do [postcard notifications] on your own for less money. Doingpostcard notification on your own means that you have to pay for printingcost and mailing, that’s going to run you between $200 and $400.It’s less money but here’s the kicker—if you dopostcard notification on your own in the State of Louisiana and you miss onehouse, you violate. If you violate you go back to jail.”[292]And 2) Newspaper Notification— Registrantsmust let the public know where they will be residing by placing two newspaperadvertisements. Newspaper notifications cost $193 per advertisement.James’ attorney, Ethan Ashley, added up the feesthat James was required to pay, and said,We are now at $1,050 or so in sex offender registrationfees for James. Now mind you, James was released from prison after 27 yearswith a $10 check and an identification card—a card that is not even avalid state ID—it’s a prison identification card. That $10won’t even get you a proper ID and remember you only have 21 days toget this done.Most jobs would not pay you within two weeks of startingthe job. It would be difficult for an individual who was on the outside witha decent job to scrape together these fees.Another thing to note is that if the registrant moves, hehas to re-start this process and pay all these initial fees again—evenif the landlord sells the house or the registrant has to move through nofault of his own, he has to pay again. These fees are associated with theregistrant wherever he goes for the rest of his life. They are forever a taxon his life.[293]Oklahoma’sPublic Health Approach to Juvenile Sex OffendersOklahoma takes a public health approach to sex offendersin the juvenile justice system that could serve as a model for other statesconsidering alternative approaches to youth sex offender registration. WhileOklahoma does not currently take the same approach to youth offenderssentenced in the criminal court system, there is no reason in principle whyit could not do so.Most youth sex offenders in Oklahoma are treateddifferently than adults. The system includes the following features:Public Notification—The adult registry inOklahoma is public and fully accessible online. The juvenile registry isconfidential and only accessible by law enforcement officials.Offenses—Children registering based on acriminal conviction in adult court are subject to the same automaticoffense-based registration system that applies to adults. Childrenadjudicated delinquent of a sex offense, however, can be placed on theregistry only after an individualized assessment of the risk they may pose.Expiration—Juvenile registration expires atage 21. A child can be rolled over to the adult registry, but this requires a separate petition, hearing, and judicialdetermination.In Oklahoma, before a child found guilty in the juvenilesystem of a registerable sex offense is placed on the registry, his or hercase must be evaluated using a three-step process.First, the local prosecutor must make a determination thatthe child in question, even after completing treatment, still poses asignificant risk of reoffending sexually. If so, the prosecutor files anapplication to have the court require the child to register as a sex offenderupon release from custody. The filing of this application triggers phase twoof the process, in which the child must undergo evaluation by a panel of twomental health professionals who prepare a report for the court recommending foror against registration. The third phase is handled by the presidingjuvenile court judge, who must decide after reviewing the panelrecommendation whether to accept or deny the prosecutor’s applicationto register the child.Over the first 10 years that the sex offender registryexisted in Oklahoma, only 10 youth offenders adjudicated delinquent wererequired to register, according to the Oklahoma Office of Juvenile Affairs.[294]In 2011, the most recent year studied, just one adjudicated youth was on theregistry.[295]Dr. Marc Chaffin, a professor of pediatrics at theUniversity of Oklahoma’s Health Sciences Center and a national experton child sexual offending behavior, told us that the specialized scheme inOklahoma makes sense because “[children] are not simply youngerversions of adult sex offenders, nor do most of them age into becoming adultsex offenders.”[296]Dr. Chaffin also explained,Oklahoma youth who do appear to present a high risktypically receive residential services provided by the state. Under theOklahoma process any juvenile sex offender registration and notificationdetermination is then deferred until they are eligible for release [and thusare no longer high-risk, and no longer subject to registration]. Thiscreates the main reason why so few youth are registered…. Those in thecommunity who could be registered don’t have enough risk, and thosewith enough risk aren’t in the community. In short, the treatmentsystem and how it works eliminates the point of registration—i.e.notifying the public about high risk juveniles in the community. Obviously,the cornerstone of this is an individual risk-based system rather than the offensebased system that the Adam Walsh Act requires.[297]Federal law mandates that any state that does not meet therequirements of the Adam Walsh Act will receive up to a 10 percent reductionin federal grant money. Based on past funding, that might amount to a loss ofabout $200,000 for Oklahoma.[298]Some judges and law enforcement officials believe Oklahoma should retain itscurrent approach even if it means losing the federal funds.VI. Failure-to-Register Violations: AdditionalPunishmentNearly all jurisdictions have made failure to register acriminal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment. In many states, thesentence for a single offense of failure to register can be as long as 10 yearsin prison, and in two states—Louisiana and Nebraska—the sentencefor a second failure-to-register conviction is 20 years imprisonment.[299]Our research suggests that most youth offenders do notunderstand the many rules incumbent on registrants or the full implications offailing to comply with all of the rules. In many cases, they do not even knowthat a serious criminal sentence is hanging over their heads should they failto comply with every particular.As noted above, registrants begin their sex offenderregistration after release from detention, jail, or prison. Over 84 percent of theyouth offenders we interviewed were still age 17 or younger at release. Many youthoffenders we spoke with reported that they were not permitted to have a parentor guardian accompany them during their initial registration at the local statepolice or sheriff’s office, where they had to read, acknowledge, and signmultiple forms with long lists of detailed conditions, indicating that theyunderstood and acknowledged their duty to register as sex offenders.Connor S.,who first began registering at age 13, described how nervous he was during hisinitial registration: “I was shaking when I went to the sheriff’soffice to register … the volume of information they throw at you is a lot… it’s just too much information to remember.” Connor said hehad to read a list of 70 requirements that “you have to initial andacknowledge that you understand.”[300]When Human Rights Watch interviewed Connor, he was 21 yearsold and had recently been arrested and convicted for failing to register hiscollege dorm address. “I had to plead guilty to the failure-to-registercharge. They had paperwork from when I was 13 where I acknowledged that Iunderstood that condition.”[301]To date, no study has examinedfailure to register from the perspective of individuals placed on the registryfor offenses committed as children. Our interviews indicate that it may beparticularly difficult for youth offenders to meet all registrationrequirements, for reasons linked to their youth and immaturity as well as theonerous nature of the requirements.Why Youthful Offenders Fail to RegisterStudies of the failure-to-registeroffense among all offenders (adults and children) emphasize the difficulty ofmaintaining registration, noting the sheer volume of obligations and theconstant vigilance required of registrants to stay in compliance.[302] For young people, who are inherently immature, keepingtrack of and complying with these requirements may be even more confusing andchallenging than for adults. Many of the young people interviewed for thisreport who were convicted of failure to register were unable to afford registrationfees, obtain a proper residence, or otherwise comply with requirements toobtain identification. For example:Gabriel P. was arrested in 1996, when he was11 years old, for sexually touching a playmate. He has not reoffended, but now,at age 26, Gabriel has three felony convictions for failure to registerassociated with his inability to obtain a proper residence. Since beingreleased from the Texas Youth Center (TYC) at age 17, Gabriel has struggledwith finding housing and employment due in part to his status as a sex offender.By law, he was restricted from living in public housing, certain areas, or in ahouse with children under the age of 14. Gabriel quickly found himselfhomeless. In 2003, less than a year after being released from TYC, Gabriel wasarrested and convicted for his first failure-to-register offense: he was livingon the streets, moving nightly from place to place, and had failed to registera suitable address. He served nearly a year in prison. Once released, he againfound himself homeless and, in 2004, he was arrested and convicted for againfailing to provide an adequate address. He served four more years. In 2010, Gabrielwas arrested for his third failure-to-register offense for not residing at theaddress on record. He served nearly a year for this offense. Since his releasefrom prison in late 2010, Gabriel has not been convicted for a new failure-to-registeroffense.[303] Heattributes much of his recent success to his wife, whom he married while inprison, and who helped find a place where they could live together.Jason Q. was 15when he was released from the Texas Youth Center for an offense committed atthe age 0f 11. In Texas, registered sex offenders must obtain a “specialdriver’s license.”[304] The license is required regardless of whether theregistrant plans to drive or is of driving age.[305] Registrants must obtain this special license no later thanthe 30th day after the date of their release. Jason says that he put off goingto get his driver’s license because he was scared. “I had justgotten out of juvenile prison. I didn’t know what was going on.”[306] Finally, he said “on the 30th day of getting homefrom placement, my mom dragged me down to the Department of MotorVehicles.”[307] Jason recounts the trip: The room was filled withteenagers waiting to get their driver’s permits or something. When thelady called my name, I nervously walked across the room to her window. She lookedat my paperwork and shouted, “since you are a registered sex offender Ihave to call the main office in Austin.” It felt like she just announcedit over the loudspeaker. The teenage girls in the lobby started snickering. Istarted getting sweaty, dizzy, and ran out of the DMV mortified. My mother andI came back the next day. The DMV notified the police that I was in violationof my registration requirements [because I was then one day late]. I wasarrested for failure to register for failing to obtain my driver’slicense within 3o days of release.[308]Samuel L.,who started registering at age 13, said he received his first failure-to-registerconviction at age 18, during his senior year of high school. He told HumanRights Watch that he tried to register on his birthday as required by statelaw, but the state police turned him away, saying they changed theirregistration hours to Wednesdays only. “I showed up that next Wednesdayaround 4:30 p.m. and was told that they stopped doing registrations at 4:00 p.m.and to come back next week,” he said. Samuel said this was the week offinal exams and he had two term papers and two final exams. “With all myattention focused on my schoolwork, I forgot to re-register. I remembered weekslater and went to the police station. I was informed on the spot that I wasunder arrest for failure to register.”[309]Max. B. beganregistering as a sex offender at age 12 in Texas. Being on the registryinterfered with his ability to complete high school and left him completelyisolated during his formative developmental years. On his 19th birthday, in anact of defiance, Max failed to go to the sheriff’s office to update his registration.Max’s father states, “he was an angry young man and sick of itall.”[310] Max ended up serving one year in prison for failure toregister, which is a felony conviction. Max is now in his late twenties andcompleted his 15-year obligation to register, but his failure-to-registerconviction has meant that many employers will not hire him.David H., whofirst began registering at age 13, was 21 years old when he was interviewed byHuman Rights Watch about his failure-to-register conviction. He spoke about thevolume of information he felt was thrown at him when going to register at thesheriff’s office: “It’s just too much information toremember. There are over 70 requirements you have to initial and acknowledgethat you understand.”[311] David said he told his university and the campus policedepartment that he was a registered sex offender attending the school, andthought he had fulfilled his duty to notify the university. He continued,“I registered my new address with the local state police, but was notaware that I also needed to tell them that I was a student…. I was nottrying to deceive anyone. I was just unaware.”[312]After being released from a juvenilefacility at the age of 17, Luke J., who was a registered sex offender since theage of 14, learned that he could not go back to school. Sex offender bufferzones barred him from coming within 1,000 feet of a school or place wherechildren congregate. Luke’s former counselor from the juvenile treatmentfacility helped him enroll in an online virtual high school. Shortly after thestart of his first semester of high school, Luke was arrested and convicted offailing to provide the email identifier for his new online school. Under thestate law, registered sex offenders are required to submit their emailaddresses and any identifiers they use before logging into websites, Facebook,MySpace, or making comments on newspaper websites. Luke explained, “Iregistered but I forgot to add my new email address that was given to me frommy online virtual high school.”[313]Special Drivers’LicensesAll states require individuals on the sex offenderregistry to carry some form of additional identification, and they can beasked, by law enforcement, to produce this identification at any time. InOklahoma and Louisiana, individuals on the sex offender registry are requiredto have a valid state issued driver’s license or identification cardwith the words “sex offender” printed in bold-face type acrossit.Click to expand ImageThe “blue card” required to be carried byregistered sex offenders at all times in Texas. © 2012 Nicole PittmanIn Texas, registrants must carry a “blue card”(see photo). Joshua Gravens, a registrant in Texas, showed Human Rights Watchthis card.[314]Josh described how police drop by his apartment unannounced to make sure heis residing at his listed address.[315] They also askto see his “blue card,” as individuals on the sex offenderregistry must carry it at all times.In Florida, registrants must carry a driver’slicense or identification card containing a restriction code, which declaresthat the card holder is a sex offender. The driver’s license does nothave the words sex offender printed on it but must include the code“943.0435 F.S.” which indicates that the card holder is on thesex offender registry.Click to expand ImageJayden C. was placed on the sex offender registry at age14. The photograph, taken February 25, 2012 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,shows the driver’s license and identification card required to be updatedyearly and carried at all times by registered sex offenders. © 2012Nicole PittmanIn Louisiana, individuals placed on the sex offenderregistry, including those adjudicated delinquent as juveniles, must obtain aLouisiana driver’s license displaying the words “sexoffender” in orange capital letters (see photo).[316]Human Rights Watch met 16-year-old Jayden C. in Louisianain February 2012.[317]At the time, Jayden had been registering as a sex offender for a little overa year. He showed us his Louisiana driver’s license and a stateidentification card; both had his photograph, address, and the words“sex offender” in big, bright, bold font.Click to expand ImageIdentification card that must be updated yearly andcarried at all times by registered sex offenders in Oklahoma.In Oklahoma, certain state residents, including some youthsex offenders who are listed on the Department of Corrections Sex OffenderRegistry, are required to be identified when they apply for either anoriginal or renewal driver’s license, a commercial driver’slicense, or a state identification card. The driver’s license or IDcard of these registrants is clearly labeled with the words “sexoffender” in red print in three distinct places (see photo).Registrants are required to renew the license or ID card annually.As a teenager living in Oklahoma, Nathaniel H. carried adriver’s license with the words “sex offender” stamped inred below his picture. He told us, “I went to buy a pack of cigarettesand the clerk asked for my license. He looked at my ID, which has the words‘Sex offender’ printed across it. The clerk threw my license andtold me to get out of the store. A woman standing behind me looked at mylicense as she picked it up off the floor. She handed it back to me with alook of disgust on her face.”[318]Failure to Register andRecidivismTheserious sentences imposed on youth offenders for failure–to-registercrimes appear disproportionate to the offenses, given that their youth andimmaturity can make it exceptionally difficult for them to comply with registrationlaws.It is unclear whether prosecutionsfor failure to register are having the desired effect of deterring subsequent sexcrimes. Four published studies have examined the relationship between failureto register and sex-offense recidivism.[319]These studies, which looked at all sex offenders (adultsand children), concluded that,Failure to registeris not a significant predictor of sexual recidivism, casting doubt on the ideathat sex offenders who are noncompliant with registration are especiallysexually dangerous.[320] Instead, results indicate only that a failure-to-registerconviction significantly increases the likelihood of subsequent failure-to-registerarrests.[321]Failure to registeris the most common offense leading to reincarceration for convicted sexoffenders released from prison, facilities, or treatment and placed on theregistry.[322]Registeredoffenders with failure-to-register convictions are more likely to besubsequently rearrested than registered offenders without such convictions.Most of the new convictions, however, are for general, non-sexual crimes andnew failure-to-register crimes.[323]Human Rights Watch was not able tofind any studies on the relationship between failure to register and sexoffense recidivism among youth sex offenders, but there is no reason to think onewould find a stronger correlation in the youth offender population than in theoverall offender population. Given that existing research finds very low ratesof sex offense recidivism among youth sex offenders, neither public safety nor crimedeterrence appears to justify their incarceration for failure-to-registercrimes. Even if one thinks registration is appropriate for some youth sexoffenders, there is strong reason to question whether offenders under age 18should be subjected to criminal prosecution for failure to register.VII. Due ProcessConcernsAt times, the juvenile or adult court proceedings thatresult in convictions for sexual offenses are marred by due process failings, promptingadditional questions about the fairness of subjecting youth sex offenders toregistration.Guilty PleasChildren accused of any type of offense (not only sexualoffenses) are particularly vulnerable during criminal proceedings. Children andadolescents are less mature than adults and have less life experience on whichto draw, and this makes understanding the court process, the charges, and theconsequences of a plea more difficult.[324] Likeindividuals with mental impairment, children may also be more compliant,especially when pressured by adult authority figures.[325]There is also evidence that children are more vulnerable to police pressureduring interrogations.[326] Theirdeference to authority and lack of sophistication can result in both false confessionsand agreements to plead guilty to crimes that they may not have committed.[327]The decision to confess or to plead guilty is particularly momentous in thecase of sexual assault crimes, since convictions often trigger onerousregistration requirements.Ethan A.Ethan A. was 11 years old, growing up in Amarillo, Texas,when his life changed forever.His mother, Eva, told Human Rights Watch that Ethan was“the fixer-upper type who loved taking things apart and seeing how theyworked—the toaster, the television, the radio.”[328]Bel said that Ethan was often picked on by the kids in the neighborhood forbeing the “good kid.”[329]Click to expand ImageA photograph of Ethan A. (pseudonym) held by his mother,showing her son at age 11, 4 months before he was arrested for committing asex offense and placed on the sex offender registry in Texas.  ©2013 PrivateEthan’s parents divorced when he was very young. Atthe age of 10, Ethan and his younger brother went to live with their fatherand stepmother in Amarillo. In 1998, when Ethan was 11, his step-motheraccused Ethan of molesting his 3-month-old sister and of touching thegenitals of his younger brother.Ethan recalls being terrified and “shaking withfear” at the police station.[330]Ethan denies touching his stepsister and brother, but his stepmothermaintained her accusations. He wrote to Human Rights Watch that when he was11, he “did not think he was allowed to disagree with the policeofficer.”[331]Ethan entered a plea to aggravated sexual assault of a child and indecencywith a child by contact. He was sentenced to serve six years and four monthsin Texas juvenile detention. After three years, Ethan was released onjuvenile probation to the custody of his mother and required to register as asex offender. He had his first photograph taken for the registry in 2001, atthe age of 13.Ethan’s mother said “the rest of his life wasdrastically altered.”[332]While Ethan was in juvenile detention, he fell behind his peers in school andhad to attend an alternative school upon release. Being on the registrypermeated most aspects of Ethan’s life and affected his family; he wasnot allowed to be around his siblings and other young relatives until theyturned 18, he was repeatedly stopped by police because they knew he was onthe registry, and he was harassed and threatened by neighbors. Because theregistry lists the perpetrator’s current age but the victim’s ageat the time of the offense, as Ethan grew older the registry gave theimpression of an increasingly wide age divide between him and his victims.As a teenager, Ethan was anxious to get a job so he couldhelp his mother pay the bills. Even though Ethan was not a convicted felon,employers refused to hire him when he disclosed that he was on the sexoffender registry. Finally things started to look up for Ethan. In 2009, atage 22, he had a girlfriend and got a job working in an auto body shop. Ethantold us that when people in his community learned of his registration status,however, some “told the manger to fire him,” and the manager didso.[333]A few months after getting fired, in August 2009, Ethanwent for his yearly registration verification and was arrested on the spotfor failing to report that he had been fired from his job. He sat for oneyear in jail awaiting trial. On August 5, 2010, he was found guilty offailure to register and sentenced to three years in prison. In Texas and moststates, registered sex offenders may be prosecuted if they fail to register,fail to verify registration information, or fail to provide notice of changeof address or place of employment. Ethan was immediately arrested, convicted,and sentenced to three years in prison for this felony offense.[334]While in prison, Ethan has persevered. He obtained his GEDin December 2012 and is due to be released in June 2013. Upon release, Ethanwill be placed on the highest level of adult parole for 10 years and requiredto resume his sex offender registration until 2020.In several cases investigated by Human Rights Watch,children (often with little legal advice) agreed to plead guilty to a sexoffense without being informed of the registration requirements they would besubject to for years or decades thereafter. For example, in 1999, Mason T. wasadjudicated delinquent for aggravated sexual assault for inappropriatelytouching a 7-year-old girl when he was 12. After completing two years oftherapy and probation, at the age of 14, Mason was informed that he had toregister as a sex offender for 10 years. This news shocked both Mason and hismother. The family was not told before entering the plea that Mason would berequired to register as a sex offender. They were never informed that anyone couldaccess the state’s online sex offender registry and see details of Mason’soffense, his photograph, and their family home address.[335]It is common practice in the US criminal justice system for attorneysand judges to sometimes use the threat of trial and long sentences to obtain aplea. Elijah B., a youth offender interviewed by Human Rights Watch, said,“I stood in court at the age of 17 and the judge told me: ‘if youenter a plea of not guilty you will serve at least 15 years in prison. If yousay guilty you can go home on probation.’”[336]Another youth offender said, “The attorney told me that if I didn’tadmit to the charge I would be charged as an adult and get 20 years to life inprison.”[337] Amother of a youth offender told Human Rights Watch,His attorney advised us to just plead guilty to thecharges. He told us that by entering a plea [Justin] would just get somecounseling and we could save everyone from the embarrassment of a trial. Iagreed. It turned out that [Justin] would be required to register as a sexoffender for 10 years starting on the last day of his probation. He was 13 whenhe started registering.[338]The vast majority of youth sex offenders interviewed forthis report pled guilty (280 people, or 94.6 percent). In only 39.2 percent of the296 cases examined for this report did youth offenders describe being informedof registration requirements before entering their plea.Retroactive Application ofRegistration RequirementsThe federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act(SORNA) expanded the number of youth sex offenders subject to registration by addingmore nonviolent, lower-risk offenders to the federal registry. SORNA also openedthe door to the retroactive application of registration requirements to individualsconvicted of sex offenses (whether in juvenile or criminal court proceedings)before the registration laws went into effect.Of the youth sex offenders interviewed for this report, 57(19 percent) were subject to registration requirements imposed retroactivelyafter their convictions. Some of these individuals had completed the terms oftheir parole and juvenile or adult probation, started families, and made livesfor themselves. Due to the changes wrought by SORNA, others who had shown norisk of reoffending were now considered high-risk offenders because of a crimethat occurred decades ago. Some pled guilty to crimes and lived for a timewithout being subject to registration, only to learn much later that they hadagreed to terms which now trigger harsh consequences. While records of juveniledelinquency are normally kept confidential, the retroactive application ofSORNA requires individuals who previously pled to acts of juveniledelinquency— and who did so with the expectation that their adjudicationwould remain confidential— to publicly expose that information tofriends, family, colleagues, and neighbors. Some, had they known that theywould years later be subject to registration requirements, might not have pledto the charges at all.As of 2012, all but one appellate district in the UnitedStates allowed for the retroactive application of registration requirements to pastconvictions or adjudications. The one exception is the Ninth Circuit Court ofAppeals. In the case of U.S. v. Juvenile Male, the court found that theretroactive application of SORNA to juvenile adjudications wasunconstitutional.[339] In2010, the US Supreme Court reviewed the case but did not address theconstitutionality of the retroactive application of SORNA.[340]Fewer Protections in theJuvenile System?Juveniles adjudicated delinquent of sexual offenses are lessprotected from accepting a plea without being informed of registrationrequirements than children subject to the jurisdiction of adult courts. Manycourts have found that a defendant charged as an adult must know the collateralconsequences of entering a plea to a criminal offense, such as registration,community notification, and residency requirements.[341]Conversely, the law is less settled as to whether children must be informed ofthe collateral consequences that result from entering a plea to a juvenileoffense.[342]For example, a 2011 study of registration requirements in Delaware, Florida,North Carolina, and Virginia emphasized,None of the four states studied requires administrators ofthe juvenile justice system to notify juvenile offenders or their guardians ofthe collateral consequences of juvenile records or of the opportunity toexpunge those records. In each of the states, a youth could have manyinteractions with the administrators of the juvenile courts, including hisattorney, and not learn the potential ramifications of juvenile delinquencyadjudications of sexual offenses – i.e. registration.[343]VIII. Human Rightsand Registration of Youth Sex OffendersInternational human rights law requires all governments toprotect people within their jurisdiction from violence, including by deterringcrimes such as sex offenses.[344] Whileat least six other countries—Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, SouthAfrica, and the United Kingdom—have implemented sex offender registration,they have done so in a more restricted manner, in order to more closely conformwith international human rights standards. Thus, in these six countries thereare often no public notification or residency requirements and the inclusion ofyouth offenders is heavily circumscribed.The important duty of government to protect persons from harmhas undoubtedly inspired the creation of sex offender registration schemes inthe United States. However, the onerous nature of the schemes and theirspecific application to youth offenders raise serious questions under humanrights law.TheChild’s Right to Special TreatmentConviction for even a very serious sex offense does notextinguish a child’s claim to just treatment at the hands of government,nor does it free a government to ignore fundamental rights when imposingpunishment or “collateral” obligations such as registration.International law recognizes that juvenile offenders requirespecial protection. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR), to which the United States became a party in 1992, specificallyacknowledges the need for special treatment of children in the criminal justicesystem and emphasizes the importance of their rehabilitation.[345]Article 10(3) requires the separation of youth offenders from adults and theprovision of treatment appropriate to their age and legal status. Article14(4), which was co-sponsored by the United States,[346]mandates that criminal procedures for children “take account of the ageand the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation.”[347]The ICCPR requires states to respond to the offenses children commit byfocusing on positive measures and education rather than punishment.[348]Those in favor of youth sexoffender registration often argue that the requirements—whetherregistration alone, or registration in combination with community notificationand residency restrictions—are distinguishable from criminal punishment.Since registration is imposed only after a child completes his or her criminalsentence, they argue, it is at most a collateral consequence of punishment andas such is distinct from the original punishment. However, the internationalhuman rights law requirement that children be treated in a manner that takesinto account their age and particular vulnerabilities does not hinge uponwhether government is imposing a criminal punishment or instituting other typesof administrative procedures that constitute “collateralconsequences.” In all cases, juveniles must be treated differently.In the United States, many sexoffender registration laws at both the state and federal levels treat youthoffenders no differently from adults. This is true of youth offenders subjectto the jurisdiction of adult courts, but also of many children adjudicateddelinquent in juvenile courts. When children and adults are subjected toexactly the same procedures and laws, the United States violates provisions ofthe ICCPR requiring special measures for children. In order to comply with itsobligations under international human rights law, the United States shouldabolish sex offender registration schemes that are not specifically tailored toaddress the situation of youth offenders.Recent cases in the US SupremeCourt raise serious questions under US constitutional law about any scheme inwhich the differences between youth and adults are not taken into account. In acase abolishing the death penalty for juveniles, the court stated, “Froma moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor withthose of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor’scharacter deficiencies will be reformed.”[349]Similarly, the court has given weight to:Developments in psychology and brain science [that] continueto show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds. For example,parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through lateadolescence. Juveniles are more capable of change than are adults, and theiractions are less likely to be evidence of “irretrievably depravedcharacter” than are the actions of adults.[350]Moreover, in abolishing the mandatoryimposition of life without parole sentences on juveniles, the US Supreme Courtbased its decision on the fact that the child’s status cannot properly beweighed:By removing youth from the balance — by subjecting ajuvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult— these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether thelaw’s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenileoffender. That contravenes Graham’s (and also Roper’s)foundational principle: that imposition of a State’s most severepenalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were notchildren.[351]In a recent opinion outside of thesentencing realm, moreover, the Supreme Court recognized that children’sperception is different from that of adults and that police officers must takeinto account the age of children when deciding whether they are in custody andneed to be informed of their rights under the 1966 case Miranda v. Arizona.The Supreme Court stated, “‘[o]ur history is replete with laws andjudicial recognition’ that children cannot be viewed simply as miniatureadults. We see no justification for taking a different course here.”[352]DisproportionateInfringement on Other RightsOther human rights of childrenthreatened by youth sex offender registration include the rights to protectionfrom harm, family unity, education, health and well-being, and freedom ofmovement. None of these rights are absolute. But laws that infringe upon theserights must be necessary to serve a legitimate public interest, therelationship between the interest and the means chosen to advance it must be aclose one, and the laws must be the least restrictive possible. For example, asthe United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee, which assesses compliance withthe ICCPR, has stated with regard to limiting the right to movement,[I]t is not sufficient that the restrictions serve thepermissible purposes; they must also be necessary to protect them. Restrictivemeasures must conform to the principle of proportionality; they must beappropriate to achieve their protective function; they must be the leastintrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result; andthey must be proportionate to the interest to be protected.[353]If a state restricts a right, itcan only do so to the extent consistent with “the provisions, aims, andobjectives of the Covenant” and only to the extent “reasonable inthe particular circumstances.”[354] Reasonablenessis achieved if the restriction is “both proportional to the end soughtand necessary in the circumstances.”[355]Some of the most fundamental rightsof children (and adults who are former youth offenders) are put at risk by sexoffender registration laws. Given the low recidivism rates of youth sexoffenders, it is doubtful whether registration truly furthers the government’sobjective of protecting future victims from new sex offenses. Therefore, the infringementson rights imposed by these laws appear to be disproportionate to their purpose.The Approach of Other JurisdictionsThe US is not alone inimplementing registration systems for sex offenders. At least six othercountries (Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, South Africa, United Kingdom)have sex offender registries, either for perpetrators of all sex offenses oronly offenses in which the victim was a child, and others are contemplatingestablishing registries.[356]However the US is alone in the scope of theregistries, in particular the public and easily accessible nature of theinformation on the registries, the onerous conditions imposed on registrants,the imposition of residency restrictions, and the broad application of many ofthese aspects to youth sex offenders.Sex offender registries inother countries have come under judicial challenge, and courts have found themore circumscribed registration requirements compatible with protection forhuman rights, only in so far as each scheme strikes the appropriate balancebetween the rights of the individual on a register and the public safetyinterest that the registries are designed to meet. The US sex offenderregistration schemes fail to meet these standards.The EuropeanCourt of Human Rights (ECtHR) has acknowledged that registries pursuelegitimate aims (such as the prevention of crime and the protection of therights and freedoms of others) and are consistent with states’ duty toprotect individuals from grave forms of violence.[357]In finding that conditions of registration in both the UK and France imposed aproportionate constraint on offenders’ private and family lives, theCourt set down clear criteria for assessing proportionality. [358]For example, in its examination of the French law the Court noted that sexoffenders could appeal to the prosecutor against their automatic inclusion onthe registry, then to an appellate chamber, and then to the president of theinvestigating chamber. The Court said,[T]his judicial procedure for removing the informationensures independent review of the justification for the retention of theinformation according to defined criteria and provides adequate and sufficientsafeguards in relation to respect for private life, with regard to the seriousnessof the offences justifying registration on the sex offenders’ register.[359]The criteriathe European Court set out was relied on by the UK Supreme Court to strike downa provision in UK law requiring lifetime registration for a person convicted ofan offense carrying a sentence of 30 months or more imprisonment.[360]In this case one of the registrants, F, was a youth sex offender, who had beenconvicted at age 11 of the rape of a younger boy, and was required to registerfor life. The UK Supreme Court endorsed the conclusion of the Court of Appealthat,“[A]n offender was, as a matter of principle,entitled to have the question of whether the notification requirementscontinued to serve a legitimate purpose determined on a review. This entitlementwas even stronger in the case of child offenders because of the fact thatchildren change as they mature.” (emphasis added)[361]Relyingdirectly on ECHR standards on safeguarding the right to privacy, the UK SupremeCourt ruled that the life-long notification requirement was a disproportionateinterference with sex offenders’ right to private and family life,because it was automatic without any opportunity for review.[362]The European Court has expressly endorsed the UK Supreme Court’sassessment. [363] The UK High Court hasalso struck down on privacy grounds other procedures for disclosing informationabout offenders.[364]Protectionfrom ViolenceTwo categories of children sufferharm as a result of sexual offenses and the sex offender registration lawsdescribed in this report. The most obvious category is the child victims ofsexual assault, who have rights to protection from harm and to redress for theharms they have suffered.However, youth sex offenders arealso entitled to protection from harm, including from vigilante violence. TheUnited States has signed and ratified the Convention against Torture and OtherCruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention againstTorture) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).Each of these treaties prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment orpunishment[365] andincludes requirements that the state act to prevent acts of violence directedat anyone—adults and children—committed by private actors.[366]Protection from violence, moreover,is an essential component in securing other human rights including the right tophysical integrity. Additionally, the harassment and violence some youthoffenders endure as a result of state sex offender registries and related policiesmay end up depriving them of their right to live together with their family, orto an education on equal terms with their peers. Such harassment and violencemay also have serious mental health consequences and infringe upon the right ofyouth to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.[367]Privacyand Family UnitySex offender registration lawsinterfere with a child’s right to privacy, which international humanrights law recognizes as more robust than an adult’s right to privacy.Even in instances in which registration is not explicitly combined withcommunity notification requirements, the reproduction of such records by publicand private actors in a variety of ways and locations—particularly in ourelectronic age—makes it nearly impossible for the heightened privacyrights of children to be respected.The Convention on the Rights of theChild (CRC), which the United States has signed but not ratified,[368]and the ICCPR both prohibit arbitrary or unlawful interference with achild’s privacy.[369] Thisprohibition—along with other international legal guarantees of treatmentwith dignity, respect, and protection from cruel, inhuman, or degradingtreatment—underlie the minimum standards for privacy set forth in the UNStandard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the “BeijingRules”). These minimum standards require that every child’s privacybe respected at all stages of the juvenile justice process, including withregard to dissemination of a youth offender’s criminal record.[370]Some youth offenders in the US havechallenged mandatory registration and community notification laws on the basisthat those laws open their records to public view, whereas existing law hasgenerally permitted children to keep their juvenile records confidential or havethem expunged. US federal courts have recognized juveniles’ heightened“liberty interest” in the confidentiality of their records but haveyet to overturn sex offender registration or notification laws on that basis.[371]The right to family unity finds articulation in numeroushuman rights treaties.[372]The concept is also incorporated into the domestic law of the United States.For example, in the context of custody rights for grandparents, the US SupremeCourt has held that the “right to live together as a family” is animportant right deserving constitutional protection, and an “enduringAmerican tradition.”[373]In some instances, however, the youth offender’sstrong right to family unity is subordinated to the best interests of his orher siblings, who the state assumes would be at risk if the youth offender isallowed to reside with the family. Cases outlined in this report raisequestions about whether government is striking the right balance even in thesecases.Education,Health, Well-being, and Freedom of MovementThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states thateveryone has a right to education, to freedom of movement and residence withinthe borders of their country, and to a standard of living adequate for healthand well-being, including housing.[374]Sex offender registration laws can interfere with all of these rights.Residency restrictions and the contradictions between state laws ofteninterfere with registrants’ ability to move residences, including betweenstates within the US. The restrictions also have a profound impact onchildren’s ability to secure housing, and thus can lead to homelessness.Sex offender registration, notification, and residencyrestrictions also have the effect of interfering with children’s accessto education. When children are unable to attend school because they are bannedfrom going near or entering school buildings, or when other restrictions ontheir residency or freedom of movement make it impossible for them to maintaina home and thus the stability to attend school, their access to education iscurtailed.Registration and communitynotification laws also have a deleterious impact on registrants’ standardof living because they can interfere with access to employment. State and locallaws often ban a registered youth offender from working anywhere near children—soregistered teens cannot seek jobs at the local mall, fast food restaurants,camps, and recreational centers. Current laws require registrants to providetheir employers’ business name and address to be posted on theinternet—further deterring employers from hiring them. Finally, theshaming and publicity associated with community notification can negativelyimpact registrants’ mental health.IX. RecommendationsTo the US Congressand State LegislaturesAmend state and federal law to explicitlyexempt all persons who were below the age of 18 at the time of their offense(youth sex offenders) from all sex offender registration, communitynotification, and residency restriction laws unless and until evidence-basedresearch demonstrates that such requirements provide a significant, measurableimprovement in public safety that outweighs the harms to former youth sex offendersand their families.To the extent that youth sex offenders remainsubject to registration, amend state and federal law to ensure that youth sexoffenders are placed on registries only after an individualized assessment. Werecommend that such assessments require that a judge determine by clear andconvincing evidence at an evidentiary hearing where the youth offender isrepresented by counsel that: (a) a panel of qualified experts using a validatedrisk assessment tool has determined that the youth poses a high risk of sexual reoffending,and (b) public safety cannot be adequately protected through any means otherthan the youth being subject to registration.The determination that registration isnecessary should be reviewed at least on an annual basis for as long as the registrationrequirement lasts.All determinations should be made with aneye towards reducing the threat of unnecessary stigmatization to the youthoffender and his or her victim.At periodic reviews, youth offenderregistrants should be able to present evidence of rehabilitation, change inlife circumstances, incapacitation (for example, disease or disability) orsubstantial time living in the community without reoffending as grounds for terminationof the requirement to register or a change in their assigned level of risk.In the initial registration hearing and atall periodic reviews, the burden of proof should remain on the state to provethat a registrant poses a public safety risk and thus must remain on theregistry.Do not subject any youth offenders tolifetime registration requirements.To the extent youth offenders determined topose a high risk of sexual reoffending continue to be subject to registration, useregistration information solely for purposes of law enforcement. Do not subjectthese offenders to community notification, internet publication, or havingtheir records open to public inspection.Do not apply residency restrictions to youthsex offenders, apart from appropriate restrictions on return to a residencewhere the victim of their offense lives. In the latter cases (as where asibling is the victim), return to the home should be managed as a part of childwelfare, probation, or parole systems and should be made on a case-by-casebasis with the input of  professionals expert in, for example, childdevelopment, psychiatry, and child protection.Do not require youth sex offenders toregister with their schools or places of employment.Amend federal and state legislation toensure that individuals who are non-registrants in one state are not requiredto register simply because they move to another state.To State Legislatures and AgenciesRequire that all persons who are chargedwith a sexual offense committed before age 18 are represented by counsel.Create an impartial body, includingrepresentatives from law enforcement agencies and the criminal defense bar, toregularly review all registration information to ensure its accuracy and toremove youth offenders from registries as soon as registration requirementshave ended. Additionally, this body should be empowered to ensure that the informationon registration sites is not misleading (for example, the age at which theregistrant committed the offense should be included).Amend state penal law on the crime of“failure to register” to allow for an exception for “goodfaith” efforts to comply with registration requirements. For those withan underlying juvenile sex offense, “failure to register” should bea juvenile court offense and should remain within juvenile court jurisdiction.Support development of a range of strategiesto prevent sexual abuse, including educational programs for families, treatmentand other resources for survivors of sexual violence, promotion of safetyprecautions by youth and adults, and campaigns that take a public health approachto the reduction of sexual violence.Work with national organizations such as theCenter for Sex Offender Management (CSOM) and the National Center for SexualBehavior of Youth (NCSBY), national experts, and relevant local agencies andorganizations to conduct community meetings when registrants move into aneighborhood. Community meetings should aim at safe reintegration of theregistrant, as well as provide fact-based education about where the mostserious risks of sexual abuse lie and guidance on how to prevent sexual abusebefore it occurs.Involve youth offenders, family members,survivors of sexual abuse and their communities in the development ofprevention and protection programs, and ensure that their particularperspectives—reflecting their different cultural, ethnic, and spiritualbackgrounds—are taken into account in the design of such programs.ToState and Federal JudgesAs a part of any plea negotiation, ensurethat all persons accused of sexual offenses who are below the age of 18—whetherin juvenile or adult court proceedings—are advised, using languagetailored to the child’s level of understanding, of the implications of anadjudication or conviction for a sexual offense, including the registration,community notification, and residency requirements.ToProsecutorsExercise prosecutorial discretion tointerpret any vague or ambiguous statutes to exclude youth from sex offenderregistration requirements.As a part of any sentencing or pleanegotiation, ensure that all persons accused of sexual offenses who are belowthe age of 18—whether in juvenile or adult court proceedings—areadvised of the implications of an adjudication or conviction for a sexualoffense, including the registration, community notification, and residencyrequirements.To Defense AttorneysUsing language tailored to the child’slevel of understanding, advise all clients below the age of 18—whether injuvenile or adult court proceedings—of the implications of anadjudication or conviction for a sexual offense, including the registration,community notification, and residency requirements and the consequences of afailure-to-register conviction.Ensure that courts hold all required periodicreview hearings.Work to ensure that all youth charged withsexual offenses are represented by counsel.To Police and Other Law Enforcement AgenciesIf a subgroup of youth sex offenders remainsubject to community notification, eliminate the use of posters, flyers, andother easily replicable materials to alert communities of the presence of aregistered sex offender in their neighborhood. Inform community membersindividually, using accurate and responsible language to describe the potentialthreat posed by the registrant.Recognize law enforcement and other localofficials’ responsibility and authority to keep all community members safe,including people who have been convicted of sex offenses. In deciding themethod and scope of community notification, take into consideration thepotential for community hostility against registrants and take any necessarysteps to mitigate the potential hostility.For officers involved in the investigationof sexual offenses, institute training on adolescent development, issuessurrounding youth sexual offending, youth sex offender treatment, andrecidivism rates.AcknowledgmentsWe are deeply grateful to the Soros Open Society Foundationfor their generous support and encouragement.

Mary was a dedicated motherand activist, and CEO of www.sosen.org. She successfully fought to have herteenage son removed from the registry for a consensual relationship with apeer. Mary left behind a lasting legacy.Through her tireless efforts and dedication, she helpedbring the complex issue of US sex offender laws to national prominence andinspired the passage of laws to protect children charged with certain offensesfrom a lifetime on the sex offender registry.[1]For readability, this summary avoids the term “adjudicateddelinquent” to describe a finding of guilt in a juvenile court judgment.However, this phrase is used in the remainder of this report because juvenilecourt judgments are not considered convictions.[2] TheSex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) is section 111 of theAdam Walsh Act Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, codified at 42 U.S.C.§16911, which governs the applicability of SORNA’s sex offender registrationrequirements to juvenile offenders who are adjudicated delinquent of a sexoffense. 42 U.S.C. §16911(8) requires jurisdictions to expand sex offenderregistration to juveniles.

For example, presidential candidate Bob Dole said duringhis 1996 campaign, “[u]nless something is done soon, some oftoday’s newborns will become tomorrow’ssuperpredators—merciless criminals capable of committing the most viciousof acts for the most trivial of reasons.” Policymakers used the notion ofthe juvenile “superpredator” (coined by academic John DiIulio) as ajustification for increasingly punitive and harsh treatment of children undernew criminal laws. See generally Jonathon Simon, Governing through Crime:How the War on Crime Transformed American Democracy and Created a Culture ofFear (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007) (addressing the importationof crime control into school administration); Aaron Kupchik, JudgingJuveniles: Prosecuting Adolescents in Adult and Juvenile Courts (New York:New York University Press, 2006) (describing a “sequential model ofjustice,” or a system that borrows both a criminal justice model and ajuvenile justice model, as a way of understanding prosecution of adolescents incriminal court). The superpredator myth has been discredited. Dire predictionsthat “the rise in violent arrests of juveniles in the early 1990s wouldcombine with a growing youth population to produce an extended crimeepidemic” have proved inaccurate. Juvenile crime rates began a steadydecline around 1994, reaching low levels not seen since the late 1970s.

See generally In re Wentworth,651 N.W.2d 773, 777 (2002).[31] Duringthe March 2006 discussion, Representative John Conyers (D-MI) noted that“this legislation, all 164 pages, has managed to completely circumventthe traditional legislative process.” 152 Cong. Rec. H677 (2006)(statement of Rep. John Conyers). In a July 2006 discussion on the Act,Representative Robert Scott (D-VA) avowed that “unlike most of mycolleagues we will hear from today, I believe that we can do better than thisbill to effectively address the scourge of child sexual assault.” 152Cong. Rec. H5723-24 (2006) (statement of Rep. Robert Scott). Regretfully,lawmakers misinformed their peers that individuals convicted of sex offensesare more serious offenders because of their propensity to reoffend. USRepresentative Ric Keller (R-FL) noted that “[t]he best way to protectchildren is to keep child predators locked up in the first place, becausesomeone who has molested a child will do it again and again and again.”Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security ofthe Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong.[32] TitleI, §111.8 of the Adam Walsh Act, Pub. L. No. 109-248, (2006). The AmieZyla provision was named after Amie Zyla of Waukesha, Wisconsin, who was 8years old when she was sexually assaulted and threatened by 14-year-old JoshuaWade. Wade was adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court, and was thereforerequired under Wisconsin law to register with local police as a sex offender.Less than a decade later, while still being monitored as a sex offender, Wadewas arrested for assaulting and enticing children to his apartment. Wade wasnever convicted of these charges. However, Amie Zyla and her parents weresuccessful in lobbying the state legislature to take some additional actionagainst children accused of sexual misconduct. Amie and her parents then tooktheir cause to Washington, DC. The Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime,Terrorism, and Homeland Security,  James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), who wasalso from Waukesha County, arranged for Ms. Zyla to speak behind closed doors,without any expert testimony, before members of Congress, advocating forextending the Adam Walsh Act to children by placing them on public sex offenderregistries. “The simple truth is that juvenile sex offenders turn intoadult predators.… I want to challenge you to look deep down inside.Isn’t it time to put our kids’ safety before the rights of sexualoffenders, adult or juvenile? When is enough going to be enough?” askedMs. Zyla. After Ms. Zyla’s brief speech, Congressional supporters of theact proposed that the Adam Walsh Act be expanded to include children. In lessthan an hour, without supporting data or expert testimony, Congress voted, forpurposes of sex offender registration and notification, to expand thedefinition of a “criminal conviction” to include an“adjudication of delinquency” of a child. The provision extendingsex offender registration and notification was eventually named after the17-year-old and is now referred to as SORNA Section 111 - Amie Zyla Expansionof Sex Offender Definition provision (Amie Zyla expansion is codified by 42U.S.C. §16911(8)).[33] Amie Zyla expansionis codified by 42 U.S.C. §16911(8); The National Guidelines for SexOffender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (July 2, 2008).[34] Title 42 U.S.C.S. § 16913creates the sex offender registration requirements, and 18 U.S.C.S. § 2250(g)imposes criminal penalties for failing to register under SORNA.[35]42 U.S.C.S. § 16911(5);The US Department of Justice, under SORNA, expands the definition of “specifiedoffense against a minor” to include all offenses by children. The term“specified offense against a minor” means an offense against aminor that involves any of a list of itemized offenses.[36]42 U.S.C.A. § 16911 (2)-(4)(Section 111(2)-(4) of SORNA defines three “tiers” of sexoffenders. The tier classifications have implications in three areas: (i) undersection 115, the required duration of registration depends primarily on thetier; (ii) under section 116, the required frequency of in-person appearancesby sex offenders to verify registration information depends on the tier. SORNAsorts offenders into three tiers to determine the duration of theirregistration obligations. Tier III includes any sex offender whose offense ispunishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year and is comparable to or moresevere than aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse (as described in sections 2241 and 2242 of Title 18). 42 U.S.C.A. § 16911(4).Tier III offenders must register for life.

It is a public-private partnership, funded in part byCongress and in part by the private sector, which has operated underCongressional authority as the national resource center and clearinghouse onmissing and exploited children. NCMEC created the survey in 2006, following theenactment of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act in July of thatyear. Each year since the survey was created, NCMEC contacts the sex offenderregistry in each state as well as registries located in the District ofColumbia and five US territories (Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam,American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). The USVirgin Islands, St. Thomas, and St. Croix maintain separate sex offenderregistries, bringing the total number of registries surveyed to 57. NCMEC hasconducted 13 sex offender register surveys since 2006, and they were performedquarterly until 2009. Since then, they have been done twice each year.[92]Of these interviews, 281 were with the individuals themselves; 15 wereconducted with family members of registrants.[93]Since Human Rights Watch was seeking individuals willing to speak about theimpact registration has had on their lives, it is impossible to know how thoseinterviewed are similar or different from other registrants.

Several comments focused on how, as a society,Americans generally refuse to punish the nation’s youth as harshly asthey do other adults, or to hold them to the same level of culpability aspeople who are older and more mature. The avowed priority of the US juvenilejustice system (in theory if not always in practice) has, historically, beenrehabilitation rather than retribution. Juvenile proceedings by and large takeplace away from the public eye, and delinquency adjudications do not becomepart of a young person’s permanent criminal record.[135]42 U.S.C. §16901 (2006), et seq. AllUnited States Code references are current as of December 2012. Two sets ofguidelines have been issued to assist in the implementation of SORNA. TheNational Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed.Reg. 38030 (July 2, 2008) [hereinafter Final Guidelines], and the SupplementalGuidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 76 Fed.

Twelve years after thecaution, the applicant lost an offer of employment as a health worker when shedisclosed the caution as part of a criminal-record check by the prospectiveemployer. The disclosure had been made with the applicant’s consent, butthe court found that she had no real choice as the employer was entitled toinsist on disclosure. The Court held that the retention of a caution on acriminal record for life was a violation of the right to privacy and there wereinsufficient safeguards in the system to ensure that information relating tothe offender’s private life would not be disclosed. Atpara. 197, the ECtHR expressly endorsed the UK SupremeCourt:“The Court also notes thatthe Supreme Court in R (F and another) recognized the need for a rightto review in respect of the lifelong notification requirements imposed pursuantto sex offenders’ legislation (see paragraph 120 above). In doing so,Lord Phillips noted that no evidence had been placed before the court thatdemonstrated that it was not possible to identify from among those convicted ofserious offences, at any stage in their lives, some at least who posed nosignificant risk of reoffending. In light of the ensuing uncertainty, heconsidered that the imposition of notification requirements for life was notproportionate. The Court is of the view that similar considerations apply inthe context of a system for retaining and disclosing criminal recordinformation to prospective employers.”[364]In a case broughtby four nurses who were prevented from working with children due to minor sexoffenses,the UK High Court ruled a systemof automatically banning those convicted of or who admitted certain crimes fromworking with children and vulnerable adults without allowing them to makerepresentations breached their rights to a fair trial. The Royal College ofNursing & Ors, R (on the application of) v. Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment & Anor [2010] EWHC 2761 (Admin) (November 10, 2010). Inanother case, the High Court ruled that the failure to allow an offender tomake representations before information could be disclosed by police about themunder the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme (CSOD) violated human rightslaw. The police had a duty to afford the offender an opportunity to makerepresentations before disclosure was made. Without the offender being affordedsuch an opportunity, the court reasoned, the decision maker might not have allthe information necessary to conduct the balancing exercise that he is requiredto perform justly and fairly.

Juvenile Male, 590 F. 3d 924, 927 (9th Cir. 2010) (dismissed bythe US Supreme Court on mootness grounds). One court specified that the issueof confidentiality was immaterial in that particular jurisdiction, mainlybecause disclosure of juvenile information under its community notification lawwas limited to law enforcement. In re Appeal in Maricopa County JuvenileAction No. JV-132744, 933 P.2d 1248 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1996). This implies that ifnotification went beyond law enforcement, it would violate juveniles’expectation of privacy. Another federal court held that juveniles have aparticularized liberty interest in the established policy of “settingaside” their criminal records. However, the court stopped short offinding community notification an impermissible violation of thisparticularized liberty interest for all juveniles. Rather, it held thatprocedures to determine who would be subject to notification must consider juveniles’heightened liberty interests. Doe No. 1 v.
