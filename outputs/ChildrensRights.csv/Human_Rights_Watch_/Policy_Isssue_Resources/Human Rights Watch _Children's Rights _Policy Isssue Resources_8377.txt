Aged 17years old, he traveled alone overland to Greece, where he made his way to theGreek port city of Patras, a spot favored by migrants seeking to stow away onferries bound for Italy.After months of several unsuccessful attempts, Ahmed finallymanaged to hide underneath a truck which boarded a boat headed for an Italianport. He lay wedged on top of a box between axles for 18 hours while the boatcrossed the Adriatic Sea. But rather than finding refuge on arrival, Ahmed wasmet by police, who promptly arrested him.“I told them thewhole story [of what happened in Afghanistan], showed the scar,” he said,referring to the wound he claims he sustained during the attack by the men inAfghanistan. “There was no translator.… I was pointing, and withsome words in English. They talked and I couldn’t understand.”Click to expand ImageA hole in the fence surrounding the port at Patras, Greece;migrants use holes like these to enter the port and stow away on ships© 2012 Human Rights WatchAlthough Ahmed was a minorand despite his desire to apply for asylum, he never had the opportunity tospeak with a lawyer or meet with an NGO representative in Italy, and neverreceived information about his rights or the process the Italian authoritieswere undertaking. Instead, just four hours after his arrival, Italian portofficials sent Ahmed back to Greece on the same ship he had come on. Only thistime he traveled in a cell in the ship’s machine room, with only breadand butter to eat and no access to a toilet. “I was all alone,” he said.* * *Click to expand ImageTrucks of the sort migrants stow away on hoping to reachItaly, loading onto ships at the Patras port. Migrants stow away between theaxles, inside fuel tanks, or inside refrigerated containers. © 2012Human Rights WatchBased on interviews with 29 migrantsand asylum seekers—men and boys—who had been returned to Greece byItalian border officials, as well as experts and social workers, and governmentofficials, this report documents the journeys and processing of the thousandsof migrants and asylum seekers—including unaccompanied migrant childrenlike Ahmed—who stow away on ferries from Greece to Italy every year. Thetrip itself is inherently dangerous, coming with risk of loss of limbs ordeath, while hanging underneath a commercial truck or hiding insiderefrigerated containers or fuel tanks.Under international law, Italyis obligated to determine whether anyone who expresses a fear of return is inneed of international refugee protection or would face human rights abuse ifremoved. International standards also mandate that unaccompanied children beadmitted to the territory in order to determine their best interests. In caseswhere age is disputed, the migrant should be presumed to be a child andadmitted to the territory until an age determination process is completed.However, this report finds that once they arrive at theAdriatic ports in Italy, unaccompanied child migrants and adult asylum seekersundergo inadequate or non-existent screening proceedings that violate nationaland international law, including by failing to consider age and by failing toprovide access to information about their rights.Many of the migrantsinterviewed for this report, including unaccompanied children, complained ofbeing confined in poor conditions that included being handcuffed for theduration of the journey without access to adequate food, water, or toilets duringtheir return journey.Despite clear guidance from the United Nations Committee onthe Rights of the Child and the European Union Action Plan on UnaccompaniedMinors (2010-2014) on appropriate reception procedures for unaccompaniedchildren, Italian port officials do not always admit children to the territoryto determine their best interest. Nor do they consistently give children accessto guardians, according to Human Rights Watch research and child protectionadvocates in Italy. By failing to carry out an age determination procedure, orby not giving those who claim to be children the benefit of the doubt beforesending them back to Greece, Italian port officials also may not be givingmigrants who could be children the protection they are due under internationallaw.In addition to screeningfailures, authorities routinely impede access for migrants to lawyers, NGOs,service providers, interpreters, and other sources of information andprotection.The situation for migrants and asylum seekers in Greece isdire. One of the major gateways into the EU, Greece sharply limits the numberof people who can apply for asylum and leaves vulnerable asylum seekers on thestreets without food or shelter. Xenophobic violence against migrants andasylum seekers in Greece is a serious problem. While the government has recentlytaken steps to create specialized police units to address racist violence, the responseof the police to date has been wholly inadequate. Migrants, including childrenand asylum seekers, can spend months in detention centers, sometimes inconditions that European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmströmcalled, in October 2012, “downright awful.”In a 2011 case, the European Court of Human Rights ruledthat the return of an Afghan asylum seeker from Belgium to Greece under an EUagreement (known as the Dublin II regulation) exposed him to degradingtreatment. Since then, Italy assesses whether a Dublin return would expose anindividual to violation of their rights. Summary returns of asylum seekers fromItaly’s Adriatic ports contradict this policy.Greece is responsible forthe appalling conditions that contribute to many unaccompanied children andadult asylum seekers wanting to leave for Italy and elsewhere in the EuropeanUnion. However, once migrants and asylum seekers reach Italian shores, Italy isresponsible for their protection and processing in accordance with internationallaw. This includes during return journeys. According to International MaritimeOrganization guidelines on stowaways and Council of Europe guidelines on forcedreturns, Italy is responsible to ensure the safe and humane treatment of peopleon board ships as part of a returns process.Human Rights Watch acknowledges that Italy has a clearinterest in controlling irregular migration and may lawfully engage in returnsin defined circumstances. Border enforcement should not, however, trumpItaly’s obligations under national and international law to provideprotection to unaccompanied children and asylum seekers. Italy should suspendimmediately summary returns from its Adriatic ports to Greece.Italy has a duty to ensure that all migrants who express afear of return are adequately screened for protection needs and given anopportunity to access the asylum system. Anyone claiming to be a child shouldbe admitted to Italian territory and should also be given access to a proper processto determine the age and best interests of the claimant. NGOs should have freeand full access to all migrants detected attempting to enter Italy irregularly,whether children or adults.Greek and Italian authorities alike should take appropriatemeasures to ensure adequate conditions on ferries during forced returns toGreece. Greece should also ensure that all operations to identify and detainirregular migrants are conducted in a manner consistent with Greece’sinternational human rights obligations. The use of force during such operationsshould be strictly limited to what is necessary and proportionate.RecommendationsTo the Government of ItalyEnsure thatall migrants who express a wish to apply for asylum are given access tothe territory and a meaningful opportunity to register their asylum claimand present their case.Ensure that anyoneclaiming to be an unaccompanied child is admitted to Italian territory andgiven access to a proper age determination process, a guardian, and a bestinterests determination.Implementbest practices for age determination by provisionally treating thoseclaiming to be under 18 as children until age determination is completed,and establishing a multi-disciplinary approach that does not rely solelyon appearance or medical examinations. Where medical testing is used, relyon non-intrusive examinations including non-radiological methods of bonedensity and dental observations.Establishprocedures to verify that children traveling with an adult are in factaccompanied by/related to that adult, including separate interviews byqualified personnel as necessary to assess the family link.Refrain fromreturning adult asylum seekers to Greece until such time as it isestablished that the country is providing meaningful access to asylum procedures,proper adjudication of refugee claims, and reception conditions thatcomply with EU standards.Ensure thatall migrants are fully informed, in a language they can understand, oftheir rights and the procedure for a fair assessment of their status andneeds.Ensure thatall border officials are aware of European guidelines on border controlsat Schengen borders that permit identification of individuals who may bein need of protection.Ensure thatauthorized nongovernmental organizations have full and free access to allmigrants detected attempting to enter Italy irregularly via ports, on theAdriatic or elsewhere, and adequate time and facilities to provideinformation and assistance.Ensure thatall migrants not in need of international protection and not applying forasylum who are returned to Greece are fully informed in a language theycan understand of their rights and the procedure.Take appropriate measures toensure adequate conditions on ferries during returns to Greece, includingby coordinating with Greek authorities to ensure that all ferries operatingbetween Greece and Italy have written, transparent, and enforceableguidelines on humane and safe treatment of returnees.To the Government of GreeceHuman Rights Watch has made extensive and detailedrecommendations for improving Greece’s asylum and migration enforcementsystems in four other major reports. Most closely relevant to this report,Human Rights Watch recommends that Greece:Takeappropriate measures to ensure adequate conditions on ferries duringreturns to Greece, including by coordinating with Italian authorities toensure that all ferries operating between Greece and Italy have written,transparent, and enforceable guidelines on humane and safe treatment ofreturnees.Ensure thatall operations to identify, apprehend, and detain irregular migrants areconducted in a manner consistent with Greece’s international humanrights obligations. The use of force during such operations should bestrictly limited to what is necessary and proportionate. Excessive use offorce should be subject to disciplinary sanctions and, as appropriate,criminal prosecution.Maintaincommunication with relevant nongovernmental organizations operating inGreek port cities and keep them informed about returns of migrants fromItalian port cities in order for them to be able to inform and assistreturnees on rights and procedures.Ensure thatall individuals returned from Italy are screened to identify unaccompaniedchildren. All returnees should be given a meaningful opportunity to applyfor asylum in Greece.InformItalian authorities of every case in which Greek authorities haveidentified returnees with protection needs, including unaccompaniedchildren, and provide information relevant to identifying the gaps inprocedures in Italy that allowed the return.Immediately improve detentionconditions, and immediately create open reception centers for asylumseekers, families with children, and unaccompanied children. Asylumseekers and children should only be detained as a measure of last resortand only if alternatives to detention cannot be applied effectively.To the European UnionThrough theEuropean Commission’s Directorate General for Justice, assessItaly’s compliance with its obligations under regional human rightsand European Union law and jurisprudence, including the Dublin IIRegulation, and take appropriate measures to remind Italy of theseobligations.Furtherreform the Dublin II Regulation totake into account equitable burden-sharing among membercountries that genuinely have common asylum standards and procedures by, forexample, consideration of joint EU processing within the EU of specificcaseloads.accordgreater weight to the variety of factors that might connect an asylum applicantto a state, rather than the weight currently given to the country of firstarrival in assessing the state responsible for examining asylum claims. Suchconnections go beyond the qualifying family relationships in the Dublin IIregulation to include wider family relations (especially for reunification ofunaccompanied migrant children with family members other than parents orguardians), community ties, prior residence, language, job skills that might bein demand in one country over another, and the personal preference of theapplicant, a legitimate factor to consider.To the Council of EuropeThe Commissioner for Human Rightsshould continue to monitor the situation, following his July 2012 visit toItaly and September 2012 report, and press the Italian government torefrain from automatic returns from Adriatic ports to Greece.To the United NationsThe SpecialRapporteur on the human rights of migrants should ensure that the finalreport on the human rights of migrants at the borders of the European Union,due in June 2013, reaffirms the October 2012 call on Italy to prohibit thepractice of informal summary returns to Greece.The HighCommissioner for Refugees should continue to work closely with the Italianand Greek authorities to ensure access to asylum for adult and child asylumseekers, and adequate protection measures, including access to agedetermination and best interests determination, for unaccompaniedchildren.TheHuman Rights Council should question the Italian government about border enforcementpractices at Adriatic ports, including automatic returns to Greece, duringItaly’s second cycle review under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in2014, and the Greek government about measures undertaken to reform its asylumand migrant detention systems during Greece’s second cycle review underthe UPR in 2016.To Private FerryCompaniesAdoptwritten, transparent, and verifiable guidelines for captains and crew onappropriate accommodation and treatment of all migrants subject to return,consistent with the International Maritime Organization’s guidelineson stowaways.Inorder to avoid possible complicity in the abuse of the rights of unaccompaniedmigrant children, instruct ferry captains to question any request by Italianauthorities to carry out summary returns of individuals who appear to be unaccompaniedchildren and seek written certification that these children have been screenedin accordance with international standards.MethodologyThis report is based on research in Italy and Greece in lateNovember 2011 and between late June and early September 2012. We interviewed 29men and boys who had been returned to Greece by Italian border officials underthe expedited port procedure, as well as with other migrants who were in Greekport cities and intended to make the crossing. Twenty of those interviewed hadbeen returned in the last six months. All interviews were conducted in Greece,with the exception of one interview with an adult in Italy who had managed toreach Italy and apply for asylum after repeated attempts.Of the 29 interviewees, 10 were minors when they werereturned from Italy to Greece and at the time of the interview; 3 were minorswhen they were returned from Italy to Greece but adults at the time of theinterview. Sixteen interviewees were adults when they were returned from Italyto Greece and at the time of the interview. The youngest person we interviewedwas 13 years old (accompanied by his 16-year-old brother); the oldest person weinterviewed was 44 years old. Seventeen of those interviewed (the majority) wereAfghans, nine were Somali, two were Moroccan, and one was an Iraqi Kurd.Where noted, we have used a pseudonym followed by an initialto protect the identity of adults upon request. In keeping with Human Rights Watchpolicy, we use pseudonyms followed by an initial for all children. Allinterviewees were informed of the purpose of the interview and that theirtestimony might be used publicly. No incentives were offered or provided topersons interviewed. All interviews were conducted individually or, as with aset of brothers, in a small group. Some were conducted in private while otherswere conducted in public places. Fourteen out of the 29 interviewees wereidentified randomly in public spaces (for example a park in Patras) andabandoned buildings near the port of Patras where migrants live; the rest wereidentified through the assistance of interpreters, fixers, community activists,and NGOs. One interview was interrupted when a police motorcycle patrolapproached; the interviewee ran away for fear of being detained.Human Rights Watch also accessed port facilities andconducted in-depth interviews with border police officials in Bari, Italy andPatras, Greece, as well as the deputy director of the Aliens Division of theHellenic Police. Our request to meet with the prefect of Bari or a member of hisstaff received no answer. The office of Prefect Rosetta Lavino Scotto, directorof the Interior Ministry’s Central Directorate for Immigration and AsylumService, responded to our letter of inquiry to say that it was the competenceof the Border Police. Human Rights Watch also sent a letter to Prefect RodolfoRonconi, director of the Interior Ministry’s Central Directorate forImmigration and Border Police, and his response is addressed in this report. Wewrote to seven private companies that provide ferry services between Italy andGreece, one of which responded.We also interviewed, either in person or by telephone, UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees field officers in Greece and Italy, and staffmembers of various nongovernmental organizations in Italy and Greece, includingRete Iside (Italy), Italian Council of Refugees (Italy), Greek Council ofRefugees (Greece), Praksis (Greece), and Doctors without Borders (Greece).Finally, we interviewed two of the lawyers (one Greek, one Italian) who filed acase against Italy and Greece for summary returns before the European Court ofHuman Rights.I. Migrants and Asylum Seekers in Greece and ItalyBoth Greece and Italy faceparticular migratory pressures as countries on the European Union’sexternal borders, pressures that are exacerbated by the Dublin II regulation,which generally holds that the country where asylum seekers first set foot isresponsible for examining their claims. Both economic migrants and asylumseekers come to Greece and Italy from countries as varied as Afghanistan,Syria, Somalia, Tunisia, Bangladesh, and Iraq.Since the early 2000s, Greece has become the major gatewayfor undocumented migrants and asylum seekers from Asia and Africa, in partbecause its islands are just off the Turkish coast and it shares a land borderwith Turkey, a major transit route into Europe. The director of Frontex, the EuropeanUnion external borders agency, said in August 2012 that Greece accounted for 67percent of all irregular border crossings into the EU.[1]Italy, which accounted for 12 percent of all irregularborder crossings, is exposed to boat migration across the Mediterranean, thougharrivals by sea have fluctuated over the past decade. In 2012, boat migrationto Greece from Turkey in the eastern Aegean appears to be on the rise,including Syrians displaced by the conflict in their country. This may be inpart due to increased border controls along the land border.[2]Human Rights Watch research suggests that the ultimate goalfor many, whether they are economic migrants or asylum seekers, is to transitthrough Greece and Italy to other countries in the European Union. Hundreds offoreigners congregate in the Greek port cities Patras and Igoumenitsa lookingfor a chance to stow away on daily ferries bound for the Italian ports ofAncona, Bari, Brindisi, and Venice. As this report documents, many face summaryreturn to Greece if detected upon arrival.Many migrants wish to travel further north in Europe. Indeed,Human Rights Watch interviews with hundreds of asylum seekers in Greece overthe past four years indicate that the vast majority would prefer to travelonward to other EU countries where they believe reception conditions for asylumseekers, refugee recognition rates, and integration prospects are far betterthan in either Greece or Italy. However, the EU’s Dublin II Regulations—whichrequire adult asylum seekers to request asylum in the first EU country theyreach and allows for returns to that country if an asylum seeker travelselsewhere in Europe—traps many in the border countries.[3]The regulation is slightly different for unaccompaniedchildren: they may not be transferred to the member state they first enteredbut instead to the country where they first lodged an asylum application.[4]However, the regulation still does not provide for unaccompanied children tomake an asylum application in their country of choice.[5]The regulation also provides for unaccompanied children to be reunited withfamily members if it is in their best interests, yet the definition of a familymember is restrictive and only applies to parents, guardians, or spouses.[6]Despite efforts towardsharmonized standards and procedures through the Common European Asylum System(CEAS), wide disparities persist in the treatment of asylum seekers in EUcountries. The egregious problems with Greece’s asylum system (discussedbelow) have prompted the revision of the Dublin II Regulation, a cornerstone ofthe CEAS.[7]The European Court of HumanRights (ECtHR) ruled in January 2011, in the case of M.S.S. v. Belgium andGreece, that the return of an Afghan asylum seeker from Belgium to Greeceunder the Dublin II Regulation exposed him to degrading treatment in Greece.[8]The Court also found a violation of the right to aneffective remedy given the deficiencies in the Greek asylum system and the riskof return to Afghanistan without a serious examination of the merits of theasylum application.[9]In December 2011, the European Union Court of Justice ruledthat member states have an obligation to verify conditions in the receivingcountry before pursuing Dublin transfers.[10] EUmember states are expected to adopt reforms to the Dublin II Regulation thatwould block such transfers to countries where an asylum seeker risks inhuman ordegrading treatment, while leaving the general system intact.[11]Human Rights Watch hasargued repeatedly that the Dublin II Regulation ignores the legitimate interestof asylum seekers to choose where to apply for asylum and unfairly allocatesthe burden of processing asylum claims to the states on the EU’s externalborders.Italy’s Approach to MigrationEvery year thousands of migrants, including asylum seekersand unaccompanied children, reach Italian shores. The vast majority cross thecentral Mediterranean—or Sicilian Channel—from North Africa onperilous journeys organized by smugglers. After a high of 36,000 in 2008,numbers fell sharply in 2009 and 2010 due to Italy’s“push-back” policy .[12] Crossingssurged once more in 2011, in the midst of chaos and conflict in North Africa,with over 56,000 arrivals by sea from that region throughout the year.[13]Italy implemented itsnotorious “push-back” policy in 2009. In May of that year, incollaboration with Libya, then under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, Italy beganto intercept migrant boats in international waters and force them back to Libyafrom where they had embarked. In some cases, the Italian Coast Guard physicallyreturned to Libya the migrants they intercepted at sea. In other cases,migrants were interdicted by Italian forces and then transferred onto Libyanvessels for return. This occurred without even a cursory screening to seewhether some might be refugees or whether others might be sick or injured,pregnant women, unaccompanied children, or victims of trafficking or otherforms of violence against women.[14]In February 2012, the ECtHR ruled against Italy for thesepractices. The Court found that summary push-backs to Libya amounted tocollective expulsions and exposed people to inhuman and degrading treatment inLibya or in their countries of origin if subsequently returned by Libyanauthorities.[15] TheECtHR also found a violation of the right to an effective remedy in Italy dueto the lack of an opportunity to lodge a complaint with a competent authorityagainst the return to Libya.[16] TheItalian government has pledged to respect the ECtHR’s ruling and nopush-backs to North Africa have been verified since 2010.Numerous EU countries suspended all Dublin transfers toGreece following the M.S.S ruling. Italy does not appear to have adopteda general policy to suspend such transfers to Greece, but rather adapted itsapproach to require an examination of any risk of violation of human rightsfollowing a Dublin return.[17]Italy’s practice of summary returns of asylum seekers from its Adriaticports to Greece appears to contradict this policy and the reasoning behind theECtHR’s rulings in both the M.S.S and Hirsi cases.Click to expand ImageAbdullah P., a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker, looks atthe sea from a parking lot in Patras, Greece, where he lives with othermigrants hoping to get on a ferry to Italy. Italy returned Abdullah to Greeceon August 20, 2012, but he told Human Rights Watch he will try to undertakethe journey again and again. © 2012 Eva Cosse/Human Rights Watch.The practice has attracted international concern. The ECtHR isexpected to issue judgment soon in the case of Sharifi and Others v. Italyand Greece involving the summary return of 35 people, including 10children, in 2009.[18] The court will decide whether such returnsconstituted collectiveexpulsions, and whether they violated those individuals’ rights to lifeand to protection against returns to ill-treatment, as well as their right toan effective remedy against such a return. Since that case was filed, it islikely that thousands more have been returned to Greece from Italian ports,including unaccompanied children and asylum seekers.The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights NilsMuižnieks, in September 2012, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the rightsof migrants François Crépeau, in October 2012, urged Italy torefrain from summary returns to Greece, citing continuing concerns over thegrave deficiencies in Greece’s asylum system.[19]A Dangerous JourneyIt was really cold. The hunger and the thirst brought us ina difficult situation. And the cold. We were falling asleep because we weretired but we were scared that if we sleep we might die and that’s why wetried not to sleep.Mohammed A., 16-year-old Afghan boy who stowed away in arefrigerated truck with his 13-year-old brother, Patras, June 28, 2012Adults and children risk injury, adverse healthconsequences, and even death, at every stage of their journey to Italy: whenthey attempt to enter ports and vehicles in Greece, during the crossing, andupon disembarkation in Italy.Adults and children travel between axles underneath trucks, orin refrigerated compartments, risking their lives and their health. In June2012, two men were found dead and three others in a coma among the 18 peoplewho had hidden under trucks and buses on a Superfast ferry to Ancona.[20]Ahmed S., an unaccompanied migrant boy from Afghanistan whowas 17 when he was returned from Italy, describes how he hid underneath atruck:I climbed a fence—a 2.5 meter fence—and fell. Iwas in a hurry so the coastguard didn’t see me, so I jumped quickly andfell, I hurt my back.… I went under the truck, on a box in between thetwo axles of the wheels. I stayed on the box the whole journey. I didn’twant to be seen. I was alone. It was painful for my back the whole time.…I still have pain in my back now.[21]The humanitarian organizationDoctors without Borders told Human Rights Watch that staff in port cities hadtreated migrants for a variety of injuries sustained while hiding under trucksor jumping fences at the ports, including broken limbs, cuts, and bruises. Oneman lost a finger to razor wire.[22]However, migrants emphasized that police abuse and generallyadverse conditions in Greece mean that they will attempt the journey again andagain. Sadaat S., a 16-year-old Afghan, told us he is determined to reach Italydespite the risks:Many times I try to go, but they[the Greek authorities] catch me. They hurt me. They put me in jail. I try toget inside a truck. I have no money for a smuggler. Some of my friends passed …in a refrigerated truck with food and meat. They died.[23]Mazdak X., an adult Iraqi Kurd, was returned to Greece in2010 after he was discovered, along with thirty other people, hiding in a trucktransporting tires when it disembarked at an Italian port on the Adriatic (hebelieved it was either Ancona or Bari). He tried to stow away on a ferry six moretimes but was always apprehended by port police in Greece. He was finally ableto reach Italy and apply for asylum in July 2012, this time having traveled ona migrant boat organized by smugglers.[24]II. Abuses in GreeceItaly’s return of adultasylum seekers and unaccompanied children to Greece sends them back to acountry without a functioning asylum system or appropriate child protectionsystem. Greece’s dysfunctional asylum system denies many asylum seekersaccess to a meaningful assessment of their protection needs. Unaccompaniedmigrant children face detention and destitution and, like all migrants, arevulnerable to law enforcement abuse, particularly in and around ports in Greece,as well as degrading conditions of detention and a hostile environment markedby increasing xenophobic violence.A Broken Asylum System and Abusive Conditions forMigrantsMigrants and asylum seekers in Greece face a hostileenvironment, characterized by a dysfunctional asylum system, inhuman anddegrading conditions of detention, and xenophobic violence.Click to expand ImageAhmed S., an unaccompanied migrant boy from Afghanistan,demonstrates how he runs into the rafters of the abandoned factory where helives when police come to sweep the area and arrest migrants.© 2012 Kyle Knight/Human Rights WatchZamir M., a 17-year-old Afghan who came to Greece when hewas 13, said life was so hard in Greece that it might be better in Afghanistan,“even with the Taliban.”[25]Chronic deficiencies inGreece’s asylum system—extremely limited access to the system, asignificant backlog in the processing of applications, the lowest refugeerecognition rate in the EU, and very poor reception conditions—arewell-documented.[26]Despite reforms initiated in 2011, the Greek asylumsystem remains largely dysfunctional, with a backlog of tens of thousands ofcases and the lowest first-instance refugee recognition rate in Europe (lessthan 1 percent in 2011).[27]Some progress has been made at second instance,with recognition rates in 2011 up to 12 percent.[28]Click to expand ImageAhmed S., an unaccompanied migrant boy from Afghanistan inPatras, Greece. Absent housing or social services, he is forced to live in anabandoned factory with other migrants. © 2012 Kyle Knight/Human RightsWatchSignificant obstacles remainto submitting asylum applications, with the Athens Aliens Police Directorateaccepting only 20 applications per week, in violation of the right to seekasylum under refugee law, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.[29]This means that many would-be asylum seekers remainundocumented—regarded as irregular migrants and withoutprotection—simply because they have not been allowed to access the asylumsystem.International human rightsbodies, such as the UNHCR and the Council of Europe, and NGOs, including HumanRights Watch, have documented egregious conditions of detention for migrantsand asylum seekers in Greece.[30]While the Greek government has taken steps toimprove detention conditions, migrants and asylum seekers, including children,continue to be held in substandard facilities that are not designed forlonger-term stays in various parts of the country. Serious concerns remainabout poor hygiene, lack of adequate medical attention, and failure to provideappropriate accommodations for people with particular vulnerabilities.Children and adultsinterviewed about their return from Italy to Greece described being sentdirectly to substandard detention conditions in Greece. Ali M., an Afghan boywho was 15 years old when he was returned to Igoumenitsa in March 2012, wastaken directly to a detention facility outside the port where he was detainedwith unrelated adults in squalid conditions without adequate food. Despite thefact that detention of migrant children should only take place as a last resortand for the shortest possible period of time, he spent 16 days in detentionwaiting to be released.[31]Qadir J., a 22-year-old Afghan returned toIgoumenitsa from Bari also in April 2012, was detained for ten days inIgoumenitsa, in a small police station jail cell with 75 people:No sleep. We were sitting on our legs.… Every nightthey bring us bad food. Every morning and every evening they were bringing twoor three more people.[32]Click to expand ImageAn asylum seeker from Afghanistan walks through one of therooms used for shelter in an abandoned factory in Patras, Greece.© 2012 Kyle Knight/Human Rights WatchIn October 2012, detainees inholding cells at the Igoumenitsa port protested overcrowding and poorconditions. Eleven detainees were reportedly taken to the hospital due to injuriescaused from banging their heads against the bars of their cells.[33]At the time of the protest, over 90 people wereheld in cells with a capacity for 30 detainees.Migrants and asylum seekersalso face a rising wave of xenophobic violence in Greece. Human Rights Watchdocumented 51 serious attacks by vigilante groups, primarily in the center ofAthens, between August 2009 and May 2012. Most attacks took place at night, onor near town squares. Attackers worked in groups, and were often dressed indark clothing with their faces obscured by masks or helmets. A network of Greeknongovernmental organizations, coordinated by the UNHCR and the Greek NationalCommission for Human Rights, recorded 150 racist incidents between October 2011and October 2012.[34]In May 2012, after the fatal stabbing of a Greekman in Patras by three men believed to be Afghan nationals, large and violentanti-immigrant protests took place in front of an abandoned factory occupied byhundreds of migrants.[35]Victims of xenophobic attacks, and in particularundocumented migrants, face many obstacles in reporting crimes and activating apolice response to attacks. In December 2012, the government moved to createspecialized police units in Athens and Thessaloniki to tackle racist crimes;the training and staffing of these units, as well as the timeline forimplementation, remained unclear at this writing. The response of the judiciaryis also inadequate. No one has yet been convicted under Greece’s 2008hate crime statute providing for racist motivation to be considered anaggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime.Since Human Rights Watch began this research, the situationfor undocumented migrants and asylum seekers in Greece has become even moreprecarious. The Greek government launched in early August 2012 a large-scaleoperation in Athens called "Xenios Zeus" to round-up undocumentedmigrants. By the end of December 2012, over 65,700 presumed undocumentedmigrants had been taken to police stations for questioning, while over 4,100had been arrested for unlawful entry and stay in the country.[36]The minister of public order inaugurated the same operation in Patras in earlyOctober 2012; at this writing, no figures related to the operation had beenpublished.[37]Law Enforcement Abuse of Migrants and AsylumSeekersGreece is hell.Mohammed H., 20-year-old Moroccan, Patras, August 29,2012Five people interviewed in the course of this research toldus they had experienced abuse upon return to Greece from Italy. Two recountedabuse immediately upon return, one the following day in the port area (he hadgone to attempt the crossing again), and two others in detention followingtheir return.16-year-old Mohammed A. fromAfghanistan told us he and his 13-year-old brother were abused by the Greekcoast guard officers inside the Patras port after their return from Italy inJune 2012: “When we got out here, they kept us in the small bus that thecoastguards have inside the port. They kept us for two hours and then kicked usand told us to leave.”[38]Ahmed S., a 17-year-old Afghan, said a police officer beathim the day after he was returned to Patras in May 2012:When they catch us they want our SIM[cell phone] cards, and so I hid it deep in my pocket (because my family callsme that way, I can’t lose the card). So he hurt me, every way kicking,punching, all over my body. This happened the day after I came back from Italy.I had gone to the port and tried again [to go to Italy].… [Now,] I haveno documents with me. I’m afraid of the police because they will hurt me.They catch us inside the port and if there is no-one there they hurt us, hurtus seriously.[39]Abdi W., a 26-year-old Somali, told us he was kicked andslapped by the police in Patras upon return from Italy in June 2010, and thenheld in a crowded jail cell at the police station for ten days before beingreleased.[40]Human Rights Watch’s research in Patras suggests thatlaw enforcement abuse of migrants and asylum seekers is a serious problem. Inlate November/early December 2011, we spoke with 17 migrants, including 10 unaccompaniedAfghan migrant children, who told us of abuses by Greek police and coast guardofficers on the streets, during sweeps, and in or near the port area duringattempts to stow away to Italy.A 19-year-old Afghan told Human Rights Watch he had beenbeaten by Greek police officers inside the port five or six days before wespoke in late November 2011:We went to the port with a lot of other people. The policecaught me inside [the others ran away]. They kicked me, they beat me with theirhands and with sticks, and told me to go away.He said it was the third time he had been beaten during themonth he had been in Patras.[41]Unaccompanied migrant children, instead of being assisted bychild protection agencies, can end up sleeping on the streets and may beharassed by the police. An Afghan boy named Azim J., who came to Greece when hewas 15 years old, and who was 16 when interviewed, observed that he is“constantly chased by the police [in Patras]. Everywhere we go, thepolice are there, on the streets in the day, at night …everywhere.”[42]Migrants told us that policesometimes use dogs to detect stowaways in the port: Khalil B., a 27-year-oldSudanese man also told us guards had unleashed a dog—“a very meandog, big like a cow”—at the port.[43] A16-year-old Afghan boy, Assad H., was discovered hiding in a truck in thePatras port in late September 2011 and bitten by a guard dog on his arm:One [of the police] twisted my hand behind my back and theother let the chain off the dog and said something to the dog, and he attacked.While the other officer held me. I was crying, the commandos [port police] tookme behind the tracks so no one could see me and they left me there. [44]III. Summary Returns from Italy to GreeceSummary returns, includingthose documented in this report, of unaccompanied children and adult asylumseekers from Adriatic ports in Italy violate Italy’s obligations undernational and international law. Port police fail to screen adequately forchildren, asylum seekers, and others in need of protection, and limited accessfor nongovernmental organizations means migrants do not receive the assistancethey need to exercise their rights.Both national and international law protect asylum seekersand unaccompanied children from summary returns without proper screening. Practicesat Italian ports on the Adriatic, however, violate provisions in national lawensuring access to a fair asylum procedure, protection against refoulement (thereturn of anyone to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened orwhere they would face the threat of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment),and the prohibition of expulsion of unaccompanied children.Legal Framework for Italy’s Summary Returnsto GreeceThe Italian government asserts that all returns fromAdriatic ports to Greece fall within the scope of a 1999 bilateral readmissionagreement between the two countries.[45]However, many returns appear to be informal, summary returns grounded indomestic Italian law, with fewer safeguards.The 1999 readmissionagreement, which obliges both parties to accept “withoutformalities” the return of undocumented migrants when authorities candemonstrate they have traveled irregularly from one country to the other,explicitly binds both parties to respect international human rights treaties,and specifically the 1951 Refugee Convention.[46]The agreement makes no specificreference to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, although both countriesare parties to the Convention and were so at the time of entering into theagreement.[47]Likewise, the agreement has no explicit incorporation of their obligationswith respect to unaccompanied migrant children, though both countries are ofcourse bound by international law on these points.The agreement, which entered into effect in2001, provides for formal readmissions upon request and within a stipulatedtime-frame for third-country nationals detected entering Italy at unofficial borderpoints along the coastline or detected elsewhere in Italian territory.[48]The receiving state may refuse readmission if the evidence isinsufficient to prove their obligation to readmit the individual.[49]Human RightsWatch obtained contradictory statistics from the Italian and Greek authoritieswith respect to readmissions under the formal agreement. According to Greekauthorities, Greece accepted the formal readmission of 875 people out of atotal of 1,697 requests from Italy in 2011 and the first six months of 2012.[50]Only 214 migrants were ultimately readmittedin that time-frame; Greek officials could offer no explanation for thediscrepancy.[51]The Italian government told Human RightsWatch that 2,334 foreigners were readmitted to Greece in 2011 alone; 1,232 werereadmitted to Greece in the first ten months of 2012.[52]In the same time-frame—2011 andthe first ten months of 2012—402 minors and 117 adult asylum seekerscoming through Greece were allowed to enter Italian territory.[53]Many returns however appear to be carried out on the basisof Italy’s Consolidated Immigration Act that allows for the return ofirregular migrants from border entry points to their departure point. Article10 of the Consolidated Immigration Act provides for refusal of entry and returnto the country of departure for individuals without necessary travel documentsintercepted at border points. When an undocumented migrant travels to Italy ona commercial carrier, such as an airline or a ferry company, that carrier isobligated under Italian law to carry out the return to the country of departureor to the country that provided travel documents to the individual concerned.[54]Article 10 of the Act specifically prohibits such returns in cases governed by“provisions relating to the granting of political asylum, refugee status,or temporary protection for humanitarian reasons.”[55]The same article provides for foreigners to be provided “necessaryassistance” at the border and for all returns to be recorded.[56]The Act prohibits the expulsion or return of a foreigner tothe risk of persecution on the grounds of race, sex, language, citizenship,religion, political opinion, or personal or social condition.[57]The Act guarantees all foreigners “located at the Italian borders or onItalian territory … the fundamental human rights provided for undernational laws and applicable international conventions.”[58]Unaccompanied children may never be expelled except for reasons of public orderor security.[59]In a letter to Human RightsWatch, Prefect Rodolfo Ronconi, director of the Italian InteriorMinistry’s Central Directorate for Immigration and Border Police, statedthat the “rejection at the border” procedure under Article 10 ofthe Consolidated Immigration Act is not applicable to returns to Greece because“the concept of a border between Italy and Greece has disappeared.”[60]Both countries belong to the Schengen Area, a zoneof open border travel comprising most EU member states and some neighboringcountries.[61]Prefect Ronconi’s letter asserts that the twocountries agreed to a procedure whereby irregular migrants can be re-embarkedon the same boat with which they arrived, in the custody of the captain forreturn.[62]This summary procedure, however, is not laid out inthe bilateral agreement, and this official response fails to account for theapparent discrepancy between the procedures established in the bilateralagreement and the summary procedure.Procedures at the port ofBari, where Human Rights Watch had access to port facilities and border policeofficials, resemble more rejection at the border than the formal readmissionsstipulated in the bilateral agreement. Border police place irregular migrants inthe custody of the commercial ferry’s captain for the return journey toGreece within hours of arrival in Italy. Border police officials in Bariprovided Human Rights Watch with a copy of the form given to ferry captains insuch cases (see Annex I). The form, in Italian and English, includes the namesof up to four individuals, the reason for refusal to enter Italian territory,and an order to the ship’s captain to “take them immediately onboard and take [them] back to the country from which they came” withreference to the Consolidated Immigration Act.[63]The captain must give this form to Greek border officialsupon handing over the individuals, they said.[64]Inadequate Safeguards at Adriatic PortsI tried to ask for asylum but they didn’t give me achance. I wanted to talk but there was no translator and I don’t speakItalian.Youssef L., Moroccan asylum seeker, Patras, August 29,2012Safeguards at Italy’s Adriatic ports are inadequate.Although the Italian government maintains that port procedures fully respecthuman rights and ensure that those in need of assistance and internationalprotection are identified, Human Rights Watch found that Italian officials failto screen adequately for children and to conduct adequate age assessments, orto give asylum seekers the opportunity to lodge claims for internationalprotection.[65] NGOswithin the ports are not given adequate access to incoming migrants in order toprovide assistance in securing individuals’ rights. These failuresviolate Italy’s international obligations as well as Italian law.The lack of access to specialized service-providers andinterpreters, or information about applying for asylum, is a significantobstacle. None of those Human Rights Watch interviewed had had access to anyofficials who could help them besides border police and none were giveninformation about asylum. Only 7 of the 29 people we interviewed who hadundergone this process were assisted by an interpreter at an Italian port.[66]None of the boys who told Italian border police they were children were givenaccess to a guardian or to legal counsel, as required by the Convention on theRights of the Child.[67]Click to expand ImageAt a local NGO office in Patras, Greece, a migrant explainsthe drawings made by migrant children that tell the stories of their lives intheir country of origin. © 2012 Kyle Knight/Human Rights WatchEach port city—Ancona, Bari, Brindisi, andVenice—has an NGO with a government contract to provide information andassistance to individuals apprehended upon arrival. These organizations appearto have varying access and scope to perform their jobs. In Bari, where HumanRights Watch conducted interviews with port police and staff at Rete Iside, theassociation with the contract to provide these services to incomingundocumented migrants, access appears to be severely limited. Rete Iside staffdo not have access to the “sterile zone” where ferries disembarkand cannot independently observe detection methods or treatment, nor can theyknow of individuals in need of information unless the border police informthem.[68]Interviews with Rete Iside staff and Bari border police madeit clear that in Bari, the police make their own decisions about who to allowaccess to the asylum system, with the vast majority of people detected withoutproper documents being shipped back to Greece. According to the Bari borderpolice, only 12 out of almost 900 people were allowed to remain in Italy forthe purposes of applying for asylum in the period between January 2011 and June2012.[69]On October 5, 2012, Bari border police discovered 81 peoplehiding in a truck on a ferry from Igoumenitsa. According to statistics obtainedby Rete Iside, there were 61 Iraqis, 12 Syrians, and 6 Afghans. Twelve wereallowed to remain on Italian territory; 69 people were sent back later the sameday. Those allowed to remain included 6 unaccompanied children, two sets ofbrothers comprising one child and one adult each, and two adult Iraqis whocollaborated with the police investigation to identify the smuggler. Bariborder police called Rete Iside to attend to the unaccompanied children and thetwo sets of brothers, but did not allow the organization’s staffer accessto any of the other migrants, who were detained on board the ferry untildeparture bound for Greece.[70]A recent report by the Greek Forum for Refugees and theGerman refugee organization ProAsyl found similar problems with access for NGOsin Ancona, Brindisi, and Venice.[71] TheItalian Observatory on Racial Discrimination in Venice, a local NGO, reportedin March that only 399 out of 1,046 irregular migrants detected in the port in2010 and the first ten months of 2011 had access to the authorized serviceprovider.[72] Out ofthe total arrivals, 892 were summarily returned to Greece.[73]A lawyer with the Italian Refugee Council (Consiglioitaliano per i rifugiati, CIR), which has had the government contract toprovide services at the Brindisi port since 2002, told Human Rights Watch thatthe principal problem there too is that the border police do not systematicallycall CIR when irregular migrants are detected. He estimated that CIR hadassisted between 30 and 40 people since the beginning of 2012, including caseswhere CIR was present at discovery and cases in which the police called CIR toprovide assistance. He was unable to estimate how many people had been returnedwithout CIR knowing about it; they have not been able to obtain officialstatistics. The lawyer said that when CIR learns of returns from Brindisi afterthe fact, police routinely inform them that no returnees had wanted to applyfor asylum.[74]In a July 2012 position paper on asylum in Italy, UNHCRexpressed concern that the possible protection needs of undocumented migrantsarriving at Adriatic port cities are not systematically identified. UNHCRrecommended a “protection-sensitive approach” to border controlthat ensures that all new arrivals receive adequate information, includingabout the possibility of applying for asylum.[75] UNHCRalso recommended implementation of European Union guidelines on border controlsat Schengen borders, which dictate that:A third-country national must be considered as an applicantfor asylum/international protection if he/she expresses – in any way– fear of suffering serious harm if he/she is returned to his/her countryof origin or former habitual residence … the word “asylum”does not need to be used expressly; the defining element is the expression offear of what might happen upon return.[76]Return of Unaccompanied ChildrenI hadn’t eaten in two days. As soon as the truckarrived in Italy I was very hungry so I got out and I took only a few steps andthe police caught me.…They asked me, I said I was 15. They talked to theGreek authorities and put me on a boat back to Igoumenitsa.Ali M., unaccompanied Afghan boy who was 15 years oldwhen he was returned from Italy to Greece, Athens, June 25, 2012Italian authorities at Adriatic ports summarily returnunaccompanied migrant children to Greece in violation of internationalstandards. Italian and international law explicitly prohibits the summaryexpulsion or removal of unaccompanied migrant children.[77]Italian government policy further requires that individuals claiming to bechildren must be given the “benefit of the doubt” and must be assumedto be children until the conclusion of an age determination process. Yet,instead of granting entrance to the territory pending further assessment, Italianauthorities send children back to Greece summarily or following a cursory,incomplete age determination process that fails to meet internationalstandards. Consequently, children are returned without being given theaccommodation and protection to which they are entitled.Unaccompanied migrant children—a particularlyvulnerable population—are protected by the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child, to which Italy is a party. Unaccompanied migrant children must begranted access to the territory in order to determine what next steps are intheir best interests.[78] TheCommittee on the Rights of the Child has clarified that unaccompanied children mustalso be granted access to asylum procedures, “irrespective of theirage.”[79] Thebest interests of the child must be the primary consideration in all actionsconcerning children, including those undertaken by administrative authoritiesor police, and including in the immigration context. As the Committee on theRights of the Child clearly states:A determination of what is in the best interests of thechild requires a clear and comprehensive assessment of the child’sidentity, including her or his nationality, upbringing, ethnic, cultural andlinguistic background, particular vulnerabilities and protection needs.Consequently, allowing the child access to the territory is a prerequisite tothis initial assessment process.[80]Authorities may, of course, determine that the child has noright to remain in the territory, but he or she must first be admitted in orderfor this determination to be made; rejection at the border is not acceptable.Where authorities are in doubt as to whether a person is a child, they mustfirst give that person the benefit of the doubt, operating on a presumption ofchildhood, and second, admit that child to the territory in order to perform acomprehensive age determination.[81]In a letter to Human Rights Watch, Prefect Ronconi of theCentral Directorate for Immigration and Border Police stated that allindividuals who say they are minors are taken to a healthcare facility for anexamination that determines bone age “within minutes.” In cases ofdoubt, individuals should be admitted to Italian territory and placed in thecare of social services.[82]However, Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 boys, aged 13 to17 years old, who said they were returned from Italy to Greece, as well as 3men who had recently turned 18 and said they had been returned when they wereunder 18 years of age. Nine of the returns we documented took place during thefirst six months of 2012. We also interviewed an adult migrant, who claimed hewas returned from Italy to Greece with three unaccompanied migrant children, towhom he was not related.[83]Other organizations inGreece relate similar findings. Praksis, a Greek NGO assisting migrant childrenin Patras, documented 19 cases of children, aged 14 to 17 years old, returnedfrom Italy to Greece between August 2011 and July 2012.[84]A UNHCR official in Greece who requested anonymityestimated that Italy returned an average of two unaccompanied children permonth to Patras. The official recalled an 11-year-old who was returned inAugust 2011 and a group of nine boys returned from Brindisi in November 2011.[85]In practice, and despiteinternational standards, Italy is not screening adequately for unaccompanied childrenarriving at Adriatic ports in order to ensure that children are not returned.Worse, Italy is returning even those who volunteer their ages. Ten out of thethirteen boys Human Rights Watch interviewed said they had told Italianofficials they were children. Ali M. said, “I told them I was 15, theydidn’t listen. They put me in the ticket office and then on theboat.”[86]When brothers Mohammed A., 16 years old, and HassanA., 13 years old, were apprehended in June 2012 after traveling to Italy hiddenin a refrigerated truck, they told the police their ages. “They said,‘go to Athens,’” according to Mohammed, and returned them toGreece.[87]Click to expand ImageA 14-year-old unaccompanied migrant boy from Afghanistanstands outside the abandoned house in which he lives with 25 other Afghanmigrants in Patras, Greece. Like many other migrants, he is trying to stowaway on ships to Italy to claim asylum. © 2012 Human Rights WatchOther children were notprovided the opportunity to establish their age due to the rapidity of theprocess or the lack of a translator. Both in cases where children volunteeredtheir age and in cases where they were not given an opportunity to establishit, their status as children was ignored, and no complete age determinationprocedure was conducted. Children’s requests for asylum were alsoignored. For instance, Ali M. stated: “When they caught me [in Italy] Isaid, ‘I want to go to Rome to apply for asylum.’ And they told me,‘Come with me and we’ll issue a ticket to Rome.’ Theylied.”[88]Best practices indicatethat, pending age determination, the person claiming to be a child shouldprovisionally be treated as such and admitted to the territory,[89]yet, Italy returns these people assuming they areadults. According to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, agedetermination should be prioritized immediately after arrival in the country,and the best interests of the child should be a guiding principle in theseproceedings; allowing the child access to the territory is a prerequisite fordetermining the best interest of the child.[90]Yet, none of the boys interviewed by Human RightsWatch was granted access to the territory in order to prove his age.Only one boy interviewed by Human Rights Watch said he hadany form of age determination procedure, in his case, a wrist x-ray. He was notinformed of the results of the examination. Good practices in agedetermination—a challenging field—are multidisciplinary, involvingchild psychologists, social works, and doctors, among others.[91]UNHCR and the Committee on the Rights of the Child have instructed states notto base age determinations solely on the child’s physical appearance oron a single medical test, but also to consider psychological maturity and themargin of error of medical exams, and to give the child the benefit of doubt.[92]Multidisciplinary assessments cannot be conducted in the rapid time frame—oftenonly a few hours— during which the boys are in the Italian ports.Medical examinations such as bonex-rays to determine age are insufficient by themselves because they are subjectto margins of error of up to five years, and because they expose children toradiological testing for no medical reason.[93]The Separated Children in Europe Programme, a jointinitiative of the UNHCR and Save the Children, advocates the use ofnon-invasive medical testing, such as physical development assessments and onlyas part of a multi-disciplinary evaluation when there is serious doubt about aperson’s age.[94]A senior border police officer in Bari told HumanRights Watch they conduct a more detailed interview and a wrist x-ray when theydoubt the person is under 18 years old but did not specify the conditions thatwould trigger that doubt; they do not conduct any other kind of age assessment.[95]Unaccompanied migrant children are some of the mostvulnerable migrants in the world; international law recognizes thatvulnerability and obliges states to provide certain care.Not only should Italy provide these children with access tothe territory for an age assessment and best interests determination, theyshould, for those who prove to be children, refrain from returning them toGreece, and provide them with a guardian and basic needs, including education.[96]Hassan A., a 13-year-old Afghan boy who was caught onarrival in Italy and summarily returned to Greece, said “when they caughtus, I felt a lot of despair and disappointment… I just want to leave[Greece] to have a decent life and a school.”[97]Yet, in too many instances, Italy ignores its obligations to offer thesechildren protection.Return of Adult Asylum SeekersI don’t want to stay in Greece.… I cannot takeasylum here.… I want to have asylum because I have problem inAfghanistan, I cannot live there. That’s why I want to have asylum, inorder to live free in Europe.Mohammed B., Afghan asylum seeker, Patras, August 28,2012Summary returns of adult migrants from Adriatic ports backto Greece without giving them the opportunity to lodge asylum claims circumventnational and international obligations. Some asylum seekers may choose not toapply for asylum once in Italy, even if given the chance, because they want totravel to other countries because they believe reception conditions, refugeerecognition rates, and integration prospects are better.The 1951 Refugee Convention, to which Italy is a party,customary international refugee law, and international human rights law requireall countries to respect the principle of nonrefoulement. This means anyoneseeking asylum may not be summarily rejected at the border and may not bedeported unless their claim has been fairly determined.UNHCR’s ExecutiveCommittee has stated that the principle of nonrefoulement establishes “theneed to admit refugees into the territories of States, which includes norejection at frontiers without fair and effective procedures for determiningstatus and protection needs.”[98]The laws of the European Union and jurisprudence of theEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) also oblige Italy to grant asylumseekers entrance to the territory and refrain from refoulement. EU directivesadopted over the past decade—some of which are currently beingrevised—aiming to create a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) establishclearly the right of access to procedures, to remain in a member stateterritory pending examination of an asylum application, and protection againstrefoulement.[99]Italy is further under an obligation to refrain fromtransfers of asylum seekers to other EU countries where they face the risk ofcruel, degrading, or inhuman treatment.[100]Human Rights Watch spoke with five adults who said theirpleas to apply for asylum in Italy were ignored by Italian border officials.Salem Ahmed, a 42-year-old Somali who has already applied for asylum in Greece,was intercepted in Bari in July 2012. Salem insisted he told Italianauthorities he wanted to apply for asylum:I said we came here in a democratic country and we’relooking for freedom.… I told them I’m a refugee; I left my countrybecause it’s so difficult.[101]He was detained overnight and then sent back to Greece.Other asylum seekers told usthey were not given a chance to discuss their individual situation with borderofficials. Javet Mohammadi, a 27-year-old Afghan was caught hiding under atruck as it disembarked in Ancona in August 2012. He said he was handcuffed andput directly back on the boat; the police did not ask him any questions or givehim any information about his rights. “You cry and no one is asking youwhy.… No one told me why they sent me back.”[102]Qadir J., a 22-year-old Afghan, faced the sameexperience in Bari, in April 2012: “They just straight away put me on theboat again.… They didn’t ask me questions. They didn’t informme about asylum.”[103]Click to expand ImageTrucks of the sort migrants stow away on hoping to reachItaly, ready to be loaded onto ships at the Patras port.

He told us that the police “never gave us achance to talk or ask something,” but he nonetheless believed he would betaken to a refugee camp.They gave me a paper, I don’t know what it waswritten on the paper, and they told me to put my fingerprint and I put it.…When I put my finger to the paper they gave to me, I thought … this papersays ‘we caught this person, he’s a refugee and we are going tobring him to the camp’ … But no camp.… When I saw Patras, myheart broke.[104]Click to expand ImageThis fence marks the new high-security port in Patras,Greece, a coastal town where migrants often attempt to stow away on trucksboarding ferries bound for Italy. © 2012 Kyle Knight/Human Rights WatchAfter six days in detention in Patras, Liiban wastransferred to Thessaloniki where he was detained for another two weeks beforebeing released.Two border police officers in Bari separately told HumanRights Watch that asylum seekers can and should be sent back to Greece. Oneofficer explained, “We ask them their purpose in coming to Italy. If theydo not provide a satisfactory answer, we send them back to Greece. If they haveapplied for asylum in Greece, we send them back to Greece.”[105]Another officer said, “Most of those we detect are stowaways with a Greekorder to leave the country; we send them back. They have the right to apply forasylum there.”[106]Border officials in other Italian Adriatic ports appear tooperate with the same logic. Khaled S., a 34-year-old Somali, was returned toGreece from what he believes was Venice (“a city four hours fromMilan”) in the summer of 2010 after officials ascertained he had alreadybeen fingerprinted in Greece and that therefore the Dublin II regulation applied.Khaled said, a woman traveling with her 7-year-old child as well as twelveother adult men were returned with him for the same reason.[107]Detention on Boats during ReturnsWe are suffering to go there [to Italy] and we arrive thereand they send us back. They have to stop doing this.Mohammed H., 20-year-old Moroccan, Patras, August 29,2012Italy appears to be abdicating its responsibility for thehumane and safe removal of migrants by failing to monitor the treatment ofmigrants in the hands of private ferry companies for the journey back toGreece. The ferry companies, like all business enterprises, have aninternationally recognized responsibility to respect human rights and avoidcomplicity in abuses. Yet, conditions on ferries used for migrant returns may fallwell short of international standards.Seventeen of the returnedmigrants and asylum seekers interviewed by Human Rights Watch described beingeffectively detained in unacceptable conditions on ferries during the returnjourney to Greece. Though the other interviewees were either confined orescorted at all times by ferry personnel, they did not express complaints aboutconditions or treatment.Although Human Rights Watch was unable to independentlyverify conditions on ferries for returning migrants, the 17 migrants, includingunaccompanied children, complained of being confined in poor conditions withinadequate food, water, and sanitation on board ships during their returnjourney. Interviewees described being locked in rooms withoutbathrooms or held in machine rooms and parking areas, not being provided foodor drink or provided very little, and, in the case of two young brothers, beinghandcuffed to pipes for the duration of the trip.In January 2012,17-year-old Afghan Jamal A. told Human Rights Watch he was locked in a darkmachine room for the return trip from Venice to Greece. “There was notoilet, just a bucket, the type that’s a bucket for garbage,” heremembered.[108]17-year-old Ahmed S., also Afghan, washeld in May 2012 in a “small cell with a fence” in the ship’smachine room.[109]International law requires that states not criminalize unaccompaniedchildren for reasons related to their immigration status or illegal entry.[110]Yet, some children we interviewed told us that Italianauthorities had handed them over to companies on whose ferries they had beentreated like criminals.For instance, Mohammed A., a 16-year-oldAfghan boy, and his 13-year-old brother Hassan A., told us they were detainedand handcuffed to pipes in a toilet during their return to Greece in June 2012,a trip that lasted approximately 18 hours.[111]Mohammed B., a 30-year-old Afghan said he was held, along withan unrelated 16-year-old Afghan boy, in a narrow room for the trip from Bariback to Greece, in May 2012:It was worse than a prison in the boat. Itwas something narrow like a passage but in the four sides there were high walls.…They didn’t give us water and food for 17 hours.[112]Few of the migrants and asylum seekers interviewed by HumanRights Watch were able to identify the name of the company operating the ferrythey stowed away on or the one they were detained on for the return trip toGreece. Nor was Human Rights Watch in a position to confirm, based on theavailable information, which companies transported the migrants we interviewed.Seven companies operate the ferry lines between Patras andIgoumenitsa in Greece, and Ancona, Bari, Brindisi, and Venice in Italy. Theseare Agoudimos S.A., Endeavour S.A., Ventouris S.A., Anek S.A., Minoan LinesS.A., Blue Star S.A., and Superfast S.A. Human Rights Watch sent all sevencompanies letters of inquiry in late August 2012; as of this writing, onlyMinoan Lines S.A. had responded.According to Minoan Lines S.A.’s letter, ferrycompanies are legally required to comply—at their own expense—withrequests by Italy to return migrants.[113] MinoanLines S.A. also stated that the company has written procedures for shipmasterson treatment of “irregular migrants,” referring to both stowawaysand migrants subjects to return. These procedures, summarized in the letter, requiremen and women to be separated, for children to be kept with their mothers (iftraveling together), for migrants to be allowed out on deck under surveillance,and for their accommodations to be under guard at all times. According toMinoan S.A., all cabins have access to a private bathroom, food is providedthree times a day, and migrants are never handcuffed, restrained, or sedated.The company declined to share with us the written procedures, citing securityreasons.[114] Theletter indicates that the company’s two ships operating betweenAncona-Patras and Ancona-Igoumenitsa had transported back to Greece a total of325 migrants in 2011 and a total of 76 in the first six months of 2012.[115]The governments that transport the migrants aboard ferrieshave the primary responsibility under international human rights law to ensurethat returning migrants’ rights are upheld. Council of Europe guidelineson forced return call on states to ensure the safety and dignity of thereturnee, limit the use of restraints to what is strictly proportionate, andprovide for effective monitoring of returns and redress in case of abuse. Theguidelines further remind states that they are responsible for the actions ofescorts acting on their instruction.[116] Thecircumstances of the case can dictate whether or not the detention per se orthe conditions of detention amount to arbitrary confinement or unlawfultreatment.In addition, Italy has also signed and ratified theInternational Convention Relating to Stowaways, adopted in 1957, which Greecehas also signed (but not yet ratified); the convention has yet to come intoforce.[117] TheInternational Maritime Organization has however developed guidelines onstowaways that encourage shipmasters to ensure that stowaways are treatedhumanely, and to take “appropriate measures to ensure the security,general health, welfare and safety of the stowaway, including by providinghim/her with adequate provisioning, accommodation, proper medical attention andsanitary facilities.”[118] Thesebasic standards should also be applied when stowaways are transported back asreturning migrants.Private ferry companies, for their part, also have aresponsibility to respect migrants’ human rights. Consistent with thewidely recognized responsibility of all business enterprises to respect humanrights, they have a responsibility to ensure humane treatment on board shipsand to avoid any complicity in abusive or unlawful conduct. More generally,ferry companies should have adequate policies and procedures in place to preventand respond to abuses.[119]Ultimately, Italy bears the greatest responsibility for theconditions and treatment afforded individuals during these returns. In placingmigrants in the care of private companies the Italian government does notabsolve itself of its responsibilities to ensure humane treatment, protectionfrom abuse, and an effective remedy in the event of ill-treatment.AcknowledgmentsThis report is the result of collaborative researchconducted by Eva Cossé, research assistant in the Europe and CentralAsia Division; Alice Farmer, researcher in the Children’s RightsDivision; Kyle Knight, Roland Algrant fellow in the Children’s RightsDivision; and Judith Sunderland, senior researcher in the Europe and CentralAsia Division of Human Rights Watch.

In 2008, the UN Human Rights Council endorsedthe “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework, which explicitlyrecognized a corporate responsibility to respect all human rights, and in 2011it approved the “Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,”which offered guidelines specifying some of the steps businesses should followin order to implement their responsibilities. As laid out in those documents,businesses should have policies and procedures in place to ensure that humanrights are respected and not abused, to avoid complicity in abuses, toundertake adequate due diligence to identify and effectively mitigate humanrights problems, and to adequately respond in cases where problems arise.
