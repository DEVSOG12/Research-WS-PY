 3 I.  SUMMARY  
 
Before [the abstinence only program], I could say, “If you’re not having sex, that’s great.  If you 
are, you need to be careful and use condoms.” Boy, that went out the window.  
Sally Fleming [pseudonym], tea cher, McLennan County, Texas,

I don’t know any other way but abstinence to prevent HIV.  
Linda P., sixteen -year-old student at Sally Fleming’s high school, 
McLennan County, Texas, May 2, 2002  
 
Each year, hundreds of teenagers in the United Stat es contract HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS.  Experts report that in recent years, there has 
been a lowering of the median age of HIV onset in the United States.  And, while the overall incidence of AIDS 
among all U.S. populations declined during the 1990s, there has been no comparable decline in the number of 
newly diagnosed cases among young people.  
 
There is no vaccine to prevent HIV/AIDS, and the best treatment does not constitute a cure.  U.S. 
government institutions responsible for setting public health standards have therefore repeatedly and strongly 
urged that providing complete and accurate information to adolescents about HIV/AIDS prevention, including the 
proper use of condoms as a means to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, be an important part of the 
government’s prevention efforts.  
 
The Bush Administration is nonetheless advocating for a substantial increase in funding for “abstinence -
only-until-marriage” programs, which p ortray abstaining from sexual activity until marriage as the only 
acceptable behavior for youth, where marriage is defined exclusively as heterosexual marriage in a traditional 
nuclear family.  These programs cannot by law “promote or endorse” condoms or p rovide instruction regarding 
their use and cannot provide HIV/AIDS education sensitive to the rights and needs of gay, lesbian and bisexual 
youth.  Consequently, they deny adolescents basic information that could prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  
 
Federally  funded abstinence -only programs interfere with fundamental rights guaranteed by international 
law, including the right to “seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds” and the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health, and, indeed , may have dire consequences on the right to life.  The failure to 
provide accurate information about prevention of HIV transmission needlessly puts children at risk of contracting 
this devastating and fatal disease.   
 
HIV/AIDS educators from public healt h departments in Texas told Human Rights Watch that they have 
been limited in their capacity to provide complete HIV/AIDS prevention education in schools with federally 
funded abstinence -only education programs.  Teachers whose school districts have adopte d abstinence -only 
curricula provided by federally funded programs reported that they were restricted in providing information about 
condoms that they had been able to provide prior to the adoption of the abstinence -only curriculum.  Teachers in 
Laredo, Tex as' abstinence -only program reported that they do not discuss condom use at all.  
 
Other Texas abstinence -only programs provide information that asserts that condoms are ineffective in 
preventing HIV transmission, thereby running the risk of encouraging peo ple to forgo condom use who may not 
forgo having sex.  Teachers and administrators in one Texas school district with an abstinence -only program told 
Human Rights Watch that they “don't discuss condom use, except to say that condoms don't work,” and describ ed 
an activity to teach students about condoms’ ineffectiveness.  One abstinence -only media campaign for youth 
includes radio and television advertisements that suggest that it is a lie to teach children that condoms protect 
against many sexually transmitt ed diseases.  A counselor from Planned Parenthood told Human Rights Watch that 
teenage patients had told her that they had learned on television that “condoms aren't as safe as everybody seems 
to think,” and that their boyfriends had told them that they ha d heard on the radio that “condoms don't work.”  A  
Human Rights Watch   September 2002, Vol. 14,No.5 (G)
 4 county government HIV/AIDS counselor told Human Rights Watch that an adult injecting drug user told her that 
he did not use condoms because he heard on television that they did not work.  
 
Federal law requi res that federally funded abstinence -only education programs (1) teach that a “mutually 
faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity,” that 
“sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects,” 
and that “bearing children out -of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, 
and society,” and (2) may not provide any information inconsistent with this in struction.  Teachers and 
administrators in Texas' abstinence -only programs told Human Rights Watch that they either omit discussion of 
homosexuality altogether, or mention it only as a risk factor for HIV/AIDS.  As one teacher told Human Rights 
Watch, "We don't talk about homosexuality in a love relationship.  We bring it up in certain STDs [sexually 
transmitted diseases] that are more common among homosexuals.  People in a homosexual relationship are more 
apt to catch AIDS because anal sex is risky."  
 
Fede rally funded abstinence -only programs potentially harm all youth by suppressing important HIV 
prevention information.  By their terms, they discriminate against gay and lesbian youth in additional ways.  
Given that same -sex couples may not legally marry in  any U.S. state, abstinence -only programs implicitly teach 
that there are no safe ways for gay and lesbian youth to have a sexual relationship —now or as adults —thereby 
reinforcing the hostile environment that gay and lesbian youth experience at school.   I n so doing, abstinence -only 
programs deny access to relevant and potentially life -saving health information to gay and lesbian youth and 
impede their right to an education free from discrimination.  
 
Schools can play an important role in providing informat ion to young people about the nature of the HIV 
epidemic and specific actions they can take to protect themselves from contracting the disease.  Fifty -three million 
young people, including 95 percent of five - to seventeen -year-olds, are enrolled in nearly 117,000 primary or 
secondary schools throughout the country.1  Most states mandate that education about HIV/AIDS and sexually 
transmitted diseases (STDs) be provided to students.2  Depriving children of life -saving information about 
preventing HIV/AIDS dis torts this mandate and places American children at needless risk of HIV infection.

 5 II.  RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
To the United States Government  
• Repeal abstinence -only-until-marriage legislation and enact in its place legislation supporting comprehensive 
sex educ ation that would include information and instruction about HIV/AIDS prevention, including the use 
of condoms for this purpose.  
 
• The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) should amend its guidance on abstinence -only 
education programs to require pr ograms to provide complete and accurate information about HIV/AIDS 
prevention, including instruction about the use of condoms for this purpose.  
 
• Federal government agencies, including DHHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
should en sure that adequate resources are directed toward HIV/AIDS prevention programs for youth.  
 
• Federal government agencies, including DHHS and CDC, should give priority in funding to adolescent 
HIV/AIDS prevention and sex education programs that do not discrimi nate against gay, lesbian and bisexual 
youth, and should provide technical assistance to states, school districts and local communities to implement 
such HIV/AIDS prevention and sex education programs.   
 
• Federal government agencies, including DHHS and CDC , should take specific steps to improve coordination 
of HIV/AIDS prevention and sex education efforts among federal agencies and to expand training and 
technical assistance to support collaboration among state and local education agencies and other state a nd 
local organizations that work with youth.  
 
To the Government of Texas  
Texas should take action to protect children’s right to information about HIV/AIDS, right to the highest 
attainable standard of health and right to be free from discrimination based o n sexual orientation.  To this end, 
Texas lawmakers should take the following legislative action:  
 
• Amend Texas Education Code § 28.004 to require that courses on human sexuality, HIV/AIDS, and sexually 
transmitted diseases include scientifically accurate i nformation on condoms as a means of HIV/AIDS 
prevention.  
 
• Revise the state education code to ensure that teachers, administrators and other local officials are not 
permitted to restrict important information about HIV/AIDS prevention, including information  about 
appropriate condom use.  
 
• Repeal Texas Health & Safety Code § 163.002(8), which states that course materials and instruction in the 
state’s model public health education curriculum relating to sexuality or sexually transmitted diseases should 
include  “emphasis, provided in a factual manner and from a public health perspective, that homosexuality is 
not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense” under state 
law. 
 
To Other State Governments  
All states  should take action to protect children’s right to information about HIV/AIDS, right to the 
highest attainable standard of health and right to be free from discrimination based on sexual orientation.  To this 
end, state governments should take the followin g action:  
 
• Repeal state abstinence -only legislation and enact in its place legislation supporting comprehensive sexuality 
education that would include information about the proper use of condoms to prevent HIV/AIDS.  
  
Human Rights Watch   September 2002, Vol. 14,No.5 (G)
 6 • Revise the state education code to ensu re that teachers, administrators and other local officials are not 
permitted to restrict important information about HIV/AIDS prevention, including information about 
appropriate condom use.  
 
• Repeal laws and regulations that prevent teachers and service pro viders from including information relevant 
to lesbian, gay and bisexual youth in health education on sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases.  
 
To State education and health authorities  
• State health and education authorities should provide technical and  curricular support to local school districts 
to assist them in providing complete and accurate information about HIV/AIDS prevention.  
 
To local communities throughout the United States  
• Implement education programs and curricula that include complete and a ccurate information for preventing 
HIV/AIDS.  
 
• Repeal laws that prohibit using these curricula.  
 
To local school districts throughout the United States  
• Provide age -appropriate information to students that adequately addresses HIV/AIDS prevention measures, 
including complete and accurate information about condoms.  
 
• Include information that is specific to the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexual youth in health education on 
sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases.  Such information should be integrated into  the regular 
curriculum and should not be presented with the implicit message that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is itself 
a health problem.  
 
• Ensure that teachers, school nurses, guidance counselors, school social workers and school psychologists are 
trained to provide complete and accurate information about HIV/AIDS prevention and about issues related to 
sexual orientation.

 7 III.  METHODS  
 
Federally funded abstinence -only programs exist in all fifty states and this research could have been 
conducted in an y of them.  We chose Texas as the case study for this report because a substantial share of federal 
abstinence -only funding goes to support programs in that state, and Texas has actively promoted abstinence -only 
programs statewide.  Texas’ programs also co mmand nationwide influence.3 
 
Human Rights Watch conducted research for this report in Texas in April and May 2002.  We made 
additional contacts with key informants both before and after this period by telephone or electronic mail from 
New York.  
 
Human Rig hts Watch conducted face -to-face interviews with the directors and several staff members of 
four Texas -based federally funded abstinence -only programs, face -to-face and telephone interviews with teachers, 
counselors, administrators and students connected w ith these programs, and face -to-face interviews with school 
officials both in districts that had adopted the federally funded abstinence -only programs and in one district that 
had opted out of the program.  
 
In addition, Human Rights Watch conducted face -to-face and/or telephone interviews with representatives 
from state and federal health and education agencies and nongovernmental health and education service providers 
that work on HIV/AIDS, abstinence education and adolescent health issues in Texas and nat ionwide as well as 
Texas -based academics who study these issues.  Human Rights Watch also interviewed representatives of lesbian 
and gay organizations located in communities that have federally funded abstinence -only programs and sexuality 
educators who wo rk outside of federally funded abstinence -only programs.  
 
Most of the in -person interviews with adults took place at their respective work sites (offices or 
classrooms), although some adults were interviewed in places away from their work sites to protect their 
anonymity.  Children were interviewed in public settings (such as a book store and a convention center), except 
for two children who were interviewed in a private setting.  The interviews were generally open -ended and 
covered many aspects of the issu e. The names of all children have been changed to protect their privacy.4  In 
addition, we did not name school district employees (teachers and counselors) when they requested anonymity.  
 
 
IV.  BACKGROUND: HIV /AIDS AMONG YOUNG PE OPLE IN THE UNITED S TATES  
 
Disease syndromes linked to the human immunodeficiency virus first caught the attention of the medical 
establishment in the U.S. in 1981.  In the early years of the epidemic, the disease was associated in the minds of 
the public and of many experts with ga y men and was even referred to as gay -related immunodeficiency disease.5  
Over the years, though HIV prevalence in the U.S. overall has remained very low, HIV/AIDS became established 
more widely among young adults, particularly racial and ethnic minorities .  For example, since 1991 AIDS has 
                                                 3 Two of Texas’ programs (McCAP and Fort Bend Alert, Inc.) were chosen to be among the eleven participants in the 
congressionally mandated evaluation of abstinence -only programs presently underway.  See Mathematica Polic y Research 
Institute, Inc., The Evaluation of Abstinence Education Programs Funded Under Title V Section 510: Interim Report  (2002) 
(prepared under contract with U.S. DHHS).  Dr. Joe McIlhaney, the president of the Medical Institute for Sexual Health in 
Austin, Texas, was one of three people who testified in Congress in April 2002 with respect to  reauthorization of abstinence -
only legislation and is on the President’s Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.  Scott & White’s Sex Education Program produces 
curriculum materials that are used nationwide.   4 In this report, the word “child” refers to anyone under the age of eighteen.  The Convention on the Rights of the Child 
defines children as “Every human being under the age of eighteen years unless, under the law app licable to the child, 
majority is attained earlier." Convention on the Rights of the Child,  art. 1.  5 Laurie Garrett, The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Order  (New York: Penguin Books, 1994), 
pp. 292 -293.  
Human Rights Watch   September 2002, Vol. 14,No.5 (G)
 8 been the leading cause of death among African -American men aged twenty -five to forty -four, indicating that 
many infections are occurring in this group before age twenty -five.6 
 
As a disease of young adults, HIV/AIDS call s for prevention strategies that target young people.  The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that even though the incidence of AIDS declined overall during 
most of the 1990s, there was no decline in the number of new HIV cases among young peo ple.7  Other experts 
have noted that at least through the early -1990s, the median age of HIV infection has dropped steadily from about 
thirty -four to about twenty -five.8   The Centers for Disease Control continue to emphasize strongly the centrality 
of you ng people and especially youth in schools as a target group for prevention efforts.9  
 
Young African -Americans and Hispanics are heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  African -
Americans represent only 12 percent of the U.S. population, but 38 percent of new AIDS cases while Latinos 
represent 12 percent of the U.S. population, but 18 percent of new AIDS cases.10  The rates of infection have 
increased dramatically among young African -American and Hispanic women.  A recent study found that the 
number of Af rican -American women age eighteen to twenty -seven living with HIV infection rose 40 percent from 
1988 to 1993.11 Data from the Centers for Disease Control reveal that African -American women and Latina 
women, who comprise less than 25 percent of all U.S. wom en, account for 75 percent of cumulatively reported 
HIV cases among young women ages thirteen to twenty -four.12 
 
HIV/AIDS in Texas  
Human Rights Watch conducted the research for this report in Texas counties that include significant  African -
American and/or Hispanic communities.  Texas has the fourth largest population of people living with HIV/AIDS 
in the U.S.13  African -Americans and Latinos in Texas, as in the rest of the United States, comprise a 
disproportionate share of the state’s cases of HIV and AIDS.   Overall, 37 percent of people with AIDS and 41 
percent with HIV are African -American; 25 percent of people with AIDS and 20 percent of people with HIV are 
Hispanic.  In the fifteen -to-nineteen age bracket, African -Americans account for 57 percent of AIDS  cases and 64 
percent of HIV infections, while Latinos account for 35 percent of AIDS cases and 18 percent of HIV infections.14

 9 V.  FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ABSTINENCE -ONLY EDUCATION  
 
The federal government currently provides $100 million annually to supp ort “abstinence -only-until-
marriage” education programs.15  These programs portray abstaining from sexual activity until marriage as the 
only acceptable behavior for youth, where marriage is defined exclusively as heterosexual marriage in a 
traditional nucl ear family.  The Bush Administration has been advocating for an increase in federal funding for 
these programs to $135 million.16 
 
The bulk of federal funding for abstinence -only programs comes from the Personal Responsibility and 
Work Opportunity Reconcili ation Act of 1996 (commonly known as the Welfare Reform Act), which created an 
entitlement program that allocated an annual appropriation of $50 million per year for abstinence -only education 
for fiscal years 1998 through 2002.  Known as “Section 510(b)” f unds after the provision of the Social Security 
Act affected by the Welfare Reform Act, these monies are provided to states, which must contribute three dollars 
for every four federal dollars that they receive under this program.17  The states in turn distr ibute the money in a 
range of different ways.  In some states the department of health has primary authority over the program, while in 
others the governor’s office has this authority; in some states authority is shared between the governor’s office 
and th e department of health.  With these monies, the states fund a wide variety of activities, including media 
campaigns, school -based programs and community -based projects.18 
 
Section 510(b) funds are only the latest of three federally funded abstinence -only pr ograms.  The federal 
government first appropriated federal funds for abstinence education in 1981 with the passage of the Adolescent 
Family Life Act (AFLA).19  The Act provides grants for services to “prevent adolescent sexual relations” by 
“promot[ing] sel f discipline and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital sexual 
relations, including adolescent pregnancy,” and directs that projects funded “make use of support systems such as 
                                                 15 Although in the U.S., state  and local school districts have the primary responsibility for education, the federal government 
plays an important role in local education policy when it chooses to do so.  As the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to 
Education has observed, “Federal f unding encourages and facilitates change in the chosen direction, and federal enforcement 
powers keep education within the law -and-policy framework.”  Report Submitted by Katarina Tomaševski, Special 
Rapporteur on the Right to Education Mission to the Unit ed States of America 24 September – 10 October 2001,  Commission 
on Human Rights, 58th sess. of the provisional agenda, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/2002/60 
Add.1 (February 2002), para. 13.  
While there is no federal program that s upports comprehensive sexuality education as such, the CDC’s school health 
education program, which may support school -based education programs that include discussion of both abstinence and 
condom use, received $50 million for HIV prevention efforts in 20 02--half as much as the federal government allocated for 
abstinence -only education.  The percentage of these funds that directly support student education about both abstinence and 
risk reduction through condom use is unclear, because at least some of the CDC HIV prevention funds support abstinence -
only programs; and, further, the funds also support a wide range of  activities, such as training teachers and school personnel 
in HIV prevention, monitoring risk behaviors among students, and program evaluation.   See Section VI below.  16 The White House, “President Announces Welfare Reform Agenda,” February 26, 2002, 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020226 -11.html (retrieved on August 2, 2002).  17 States meet the match requirement in a variety of w ays: by allocating new state funds for abstinence education; by 
allocating existing state funds to abstinence education; and by relying on in -kind support.  Some states shift the match 
responsibility to the local level, requiring local program providers to  meet the requisite match.  State Policy Documentation

 10other family members, friends, religious and charitab le organizations and voluntary associations.”20  Consistent 
with the AFLA’s mandate, many AFLA grantees have been associated with religious groups, some of whose 
curricula have incorporated religious content.21  In fiscal year 2002, the AFLA provided about $ 10 million for 
abstinence -only education.22 
 
The Special Projects of Regional and National Significance -Community -Based Abstinence Education 
program (SPRANS -CBAE), created in 2000, also supports state and local abstinence -only programs.  This 
program was fu nded at $20 million in fiscal year 2001 and at $40 million in fiscal year 2002.23  The entire funding 
increase proposed by the Bush Administration is sought through the SPRANS -CBAE program, which provides 
direct grants to community -based organizations (many  of which, in both 2001 and 2002, were faith -based).24   
 
Congressional staffers who worked on the 1996 Welfare Reform Act acknowledged that “the 
congressional attack on illegitimacy [births to unmarried parents] is based far more on the value position that  sex 
outside marriage is wrong and the consequences severe for mother, child and society than on empirical evidence 
linking a particular policy with reduced nonmarital births.”25  Nonetheless,    
 
Regardless of how one feels about the standard of no sex out side marriage, we believe both the 
statutory language and . . .  the intent of Congress are clear.  This standard was intended to align 
Congress with the social tradition —never mind that some observers now think the tradition 
outdated —that sex should be co nfined to married couples.  That both the practices and standards 
in many communities across the country clash with the standard required by the law is precisely 
the point.26

On July 24, 2002, a federal court in Louisiana ruled that the Louisiana Governor’s Program on Abstinence (GPA) 
had used some of its Section 510(b) abstinence -only funds unconstitutionally to “ convey religious messages and advance 
religion” by funding, among other things, programs that organized prayer vigils at abortion clinics; Christ -centered skits that 
advocate sexual abstinence; and programs that focus on the “virgin birth and make it appar ent that God’s desire [sic] sexual 
purity as a way of life” and sponsor youth revivals that “proclaim[ed] God’s word with power as to why we should live pure 
and Holy.  He made it clear that abstinence is the only way.”  The court ordered the GPA to “cease  and desist from disbursing 
GPA funds to organizations or individuals that convey religious messages or otherwise advance religion in any way in the 
course of any event supported in whole or in part by GPA funds . . . .”  The court also ordered the GPA to install an oversight 
program to monitor the use of its money and provide written notification to any group it finds to be using its money in a 
manner that violates the Constitution.  ACLU of Louisiana v. Governor M.J. Foster and Dan Richey , Civil Action No . 02-

 11On May 16, 2002, the House passed a Welfare Reform Act reauthorization bill that would extend 
the Section 510(b) funding at current levels through 2007.27  On June 27, 2002, the Senate Finance 
Committee passed a similar reauthorization bill with an amendment that would allocate equal funding to 
“abstinence -first” programs that would enc ourage abstinence but also teach children about 
contraception.28  The full Senate has not yet voted on this bill.  The SPRANS -CBAE program and the 
AFLA programs are funded through annual Labor -Health and Human Services (Labor -HHS) 
appropriations.  The Senat e Labor -HHS Committee approved an appropriations bill in July 2002 that 
maintained SPRANS -CBAE at fiscal 2002 levels and increased AFLA programs by $2.2 million.  The 
full Senate and the House are expected to address the appropriations bill in September.29 
 
All federally funded abstinence -only programs must provide abstinence education as defined by 
Section 510(b) of the Welfare Reform Act, as follows:  
 
“Abstinence education” means an educational or motivational program which:   
 
(A) has as its exclusive purpose , teaching the social, psychological, and health gains 
to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;  
(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard 
for all school age children;  
(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual ac tivity is the only certain way to avoid out -
of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health 
problems;  
(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in  context of marriage 
is the expected standard of human sexua l activity;  
(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have 
harmful psychological and physical effects;  
(F) teaches that bearing children out -of-wedlock is likely to have harmful 
consequences for the child, the child’s  paren ts, and society;  
(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug 
use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and  
(H) teaches the importance of attaining self -sufficiency before engaging in sexual 
activity.30 
  
Section 510(b) fund s also can be used for “mentoring, counseling and adult supervision” activities that promote 
abstinence.31

 12Section 510(b) and AFLA programs are not required to emphasize all eight elements of the above 
definition equally, but cannot provide information tha t is inconsistent with any of them.32  Since these programs 
must have as their “exclusive purpose” promoting abstinence outside of marriage and must teach that abstinence 
outside of marriage and a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected 
standard of sexual activity, they cannot also “promote or endorse" condoms or otherwise discuss them, except to 
provide “factual information, such as failure rates.”33  According to Michele Lawler, the director of the 
Abstinence Edu cation Program at the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, which administers Section 510(b) and SPRANS -CBAE programs, abstinence -only funding 
recipients cannot say, “if you decide to become sexually active, then here are methods” to prevent pregnancy or 
sexually transmitted diseases, or provide instruction regarding the use of condoms or contraception.34   
 
SPRANS -CBAE -funded programs are even more restrictive than Section 510(b) and AFLA programs.  
SPRANS -CBA E grantees must emphasize each of the eight points of the Section 510(b) definition and must 
target “adolescents” twelve to eighteen years old.35  In addition, except in limited circumstances, SPRANS -
CBAE grantees cannot use their own funds to provide any o ther education regarding sexual conduct (such as 
information about condoms that they cannot provide in the abstinence -only program) to any children to whom 
they provide abstinence -only education.36 
 
The Bush Administration has not limited its promotion of a bstinence -only programs to the United States.  
At the U.N. General Assembly Special Session on Children in May 2002, the U.S. delegation, together with Iran, 
Libya, Pakistan, Sudan and the Holy See, argued that the summit declaration should endorse sexual abstinence 
“both before and during marriage” as the only way to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission.37  Secretary of Health and 
Human Services Tommy Thompson, addressing the Special Session on Children, stated, “ As President Bush has 
said, abstinence is the only sure way of avoiding sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy and the social 
and personal difficulties attendant to non -marital sexual activity," and that U.S. efforts “include strengthening

programs.”38 
 
Several U.S. states have enacted legislation promoting or mandating abstinence education.  In 1995, for 
example, North Carolina enacted a law requiring public schools, as part of the compr ehensive health program for 
students in kindergarten through ninth grade, to offer an abstinence -only-until-marriage program and  to permit 
schools to offer comprehensive sex education only after the local board of education has held a public hearing and 
permitted review of instructional materials (among other conditions).39  Since 1996, several states have passed 
legislation that incorporates some or all of the federal definition of abstinence education, while others have 
considered the issue.40  (The situat ion in Texas, case study for this report, is described in detail below.)  
 
Research on Effectiveness of Abstinence -Only Education  
The major commitment of federal funding for abstinence -only education has taken place notwithstanding 
the paucity of evidence t hat abstinence -only education works to delay adolescent (or extramarital) sexual activity, 
much less changes sexual behavior that puts adolescents at risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted 
diseases and pregnancy.  Secretary Thompson acknowledged a s much in January 2002: asked why the 
administration would want to increase spending on abstinence -only programs, given the lack of scientific data 
supporting them, he noted that they are very popular with many of his Republican colleagues and said that “[ t]he 
president feels, the administration feels, a lot of people in Congress feel that this is a much better way to attempt 
to solve this problem of teenage pregnancy.  Let’s try them out and see if we can’t get it to work.”41 
 
The Institute of Medicine, the  federal body of experts charged with the responsibility of advising the 
federal government on issues of medical care, research and education, has noted that the scientific literature, as 
well as experts that had studied the issue, showed that comprehensiv e sex and HIV/AIDS education programs and 
condom availability programs can be effective in reducing high -risk sexual behaviors while no such evidence 
supported abstinence -only programs.  The Institute expressed its concern that “investing hundreds of milli ons of 
dollars of federal and state funds . . . in abstinence -only programs with no evidence of effectiveness constitutes 
poor fiscal and health policy,” and recommended that “Congress, as well as other federal, state and local 
policymakers, eliminate requ irements that public funds be used for abstinence -only education, and that states and 
local school districts implement and continue to support age -appropriate comprehensive sex education and 
condom availability programs in schools.”42

2002) (requiring that sex education, including education with respect to HIV/AIDS, “shall stress that abstinence from sexual 
activity is the only completely reliable means of eliminating the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted dis eases and of avoiding pregnancy”).   41 AP Online , January 30, 2002.  Claude Allen, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services in charge of the federal 
government’s abstinence initiative, feels the same: “Unless we put money there to find out whether it [‘abstinence -only-until-
marriage’ programs] works, we will never know.”  Sheryl Gay Stolberg, “Abstinence -Only Initiative Advancing,” New York

experts that acts under a Congressional charter as an adviser to the federal government.  The Institute wrote No Time to Lose  
at the request of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which asked that it convene a committee on HIV 
prevention strategies in the United States to review HIV prevention efforts of the CDC and other U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services Agencies, as well as those of other public and private sector organizations, and make recommendations

Studies of the effect iveness of  HIV/AIDS prevention and sexuality education programs have concluded 
that programs that cover both abstinence and contraceptive use (including condom use) can be effective in 
reducing sexual risk -taking behavior among adolescents that puts them at risk of HIV/AIDS.  A 2001 report 
analyzing methodologically rigorous outcome evaluation studies of HIV prevention and sexuality education 
programs concluded that programs that included information about abstinence as well as the use of condoms and 
contr aceptives can successfully delay the onset of sex and increase the use of condoms among sexually active 
teens.43  This report found that “very little rigorous evaluation of abstinence -only programs has been completed” 
and that none of the high -quality studi es of abstinence -only programs reviewed showed that abstinence -only 
programs had any effect on sexual behavior or contraceptive use among sexually active teens.44 
 
At least one study comparing the relative efficacy of educating teenagers about safer sex wit h an 
abstinence -only intervention found that while both approaches affected sexual behavior in the short term, over a 
longer period, the safer -sex program proved more effective than the abstinence program in reducing both 
unprotected sexual intercourse and  the frequency of intercourse than did the abstinence -only intervention.  The 
researchers who conducted the study thus concluded that, “Our finding that the safer -sex intervention curbed 
unprotected sexual intercourse, whereas the abstinence intervention d id not, suggests that if the goal is reduction 
of unprotected sexual intercourse, the safer -sex strategy may hold the most promise, particularly with those 
adolescents who are already sexually experienced.  Moreover, safer -sex interventions may have longer -lasting 
effects than abstinence interventions.”45 
 
In 1997, Congress authorized an evaluation of the impact of abstinence -only programs funded by the 
Welfare Reform Act of 1996.  Four years into the evaluation process, an interim report on evaluation findi ngs has 
yet to produce any evidence that these programs are effective in reducing teen sex, pregnancy or the transmission 
of disease.46 
 
The Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA)  requires that each grantee spend a percentage of its grant on 
independent evaluat ion of services supported by grant funds.  A 1997 analysis of evaluations of AFLA programs 
concluded that “the quality of the AFLA evaluations funded by the federal government var[ied] from barely 
adequate to completely inadequate,” and that the reviewers were “aware of no methodologically sound studies 
that demonstrate the effectiveness” of abstinence -only programs.47 
 
A 1997 report by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) found evidence that 
demonstrated that  sexual health education for children and young people that included the promotion of condom 
use promoted safer sexual practices and did not increase their sexual activity.48

 15Proponents of abstinence -only programs frequently cite studies of sexuality education programs in 
Monroe Count y, New York and rural South Carolina to support the claim that abstinence -only programs are 
effective.49  But during the period under study, both of these programs provided information about effective 
contraceptive use as well as information about abstinenc e and therefore the positive outcomes of these programs 
may in fact offer evidence to support the effectiveness of comprehensive sex education.50 
 
The National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the U.S. 
Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. government entities responsible for setting public health 
standards, all advise that adolescents should be given information about the proper use of condoms to reduce the 
risk of infection by HIV and other sexual ly transmitted diseases.51  In keeping with this advice, the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services has included among its objectives to “increase the proportion of 
adolescents who abstain from sexual intercourse or use condoms if sexually active.”52  
 
Major professional medical organizations in the U.S. —including the American Medical Association, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists, and the American Nurses Asso ciation —also advise that adolescents should be given 
information about the proper use of condoms to reduce the risk of infection by HIV and other  sexually 
transmitted diseases.53

pledge to abstain from sex may help delay teenagers’ initiation of intercourse, there also is evidence that teens who break 
their pledge are less likely to use contraceptives once they become sexually active.  See Peter S. Bearman and Hannah

Texas Abstinence -Only Education Programs  
The Texas Governor’s Office and the  Texas Department of Health share authority for the Texas 
Abstinence Education Program, which administers Section 510(b) funding.54  Since 1998, when Section 510(b) 
funds first were made available, Texas has funded thirty -two abstinence contractors.55  Texas  has received about 
$5 million annually in Section 510(b) funding for the first five years of the program.56   In fiscal year 2001, Texas 
programs received about $2 million in SPRANS -CBAE funding and $1.1 million in funding for AFLA abstinence 
education pro jects.57   
 
In addition to funding individual abstinence -only contractors, Texas’ Abstinence Education Program 
funds a statewide abstinence -only media campaign, as well as evaluation of the abstinence -only contractors and of 
the media campaign.58 
 
In Texas, local school boards have discretion to decide whether to provide students education about 
sexuality, HIV/AIDS, or sexually transmitted diseases.59  With respect to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted 
disease (STD) education, Texas is in the minority, as thirt y-eight states mandate that schools provide HIV/AIDS 
and STD education.60  Many Texas school districts provide little or no education about HIV/AIDS, sexually 
transmitted diseases, or sexuality more generally, instead focusing their attention on less contro versial subjects, 
like cardiovascular health, nutrition and obesity prevention.61 
 
According to state law, course materials relating to sexuality, HIV/AIDS, or sexually transmitted diseases 
must be selected by the board of trustees of the school district wi th the advice of its appointed local school health 
education advisory council and must use course materials and instruction that:

Human Rights Watch visited four programs in Texas: the McLennan County Collaborative Abstinence 
Project ( McCAP); the Scott & White Sex Education Program; the Medical Institute for Sexual Health; and 
Laredo’s “Mi Futuro/My Future” abstinence education program.  All of these programs receive Section 510(b) 
funding.  McCAP and Scott & White also receive SPRANS -CBAE funding.   
 
McCAP provides abstinence -only curriculum materials, speakers and other support materials and 
literature to all McLennan County public school districts except for Waco (the largest district), and to private 
schools and foster home facilitie s in the area.63   The Waco school board rejected the McCAP program reportedly 
because it was concerned that it would restrict information about contraception and that sexually active teens 
would respond to the abstinence -only curriculum by forgoing condoms  and contraception while continuing to 
have sex.64 
 
McCAP supports an “aggressive abstinence campaign in the media,” as well as community programs in 
churches, at the workplace and other settings.65  It provides referrals to health care providers “promising to 
reinforce the abstinence -only message” and offers “seminars, supporting literature, training, on -site education, 
                                                 62 Tex. Educ. Code § 28.004(e).  Although Texas law requires districts that teach sexuality education to have local school 
health education advisory councils (SHEACs), there are no timelines, deadlines or other mandates for when such co uncils 
must be established  nor any penalties for noncompliance.  An estimated 50 percent of school districts do not have SHEACs.

 18counseling and support.”66  McCAP also trains school district personnel and school health education advisory 
council members and collaborates  with local churches in developing abstinence -only activities. 67  
 
The Scott & White Sex Education Program provides abstinence -only materials and training in ten 
counties in central Texas, with the goal of educating “adolescents and adults on the ramificat ions of adolescent 
sexual activity including the medical, social, economic and legal consequences.”68  Scott & White uses “Worth 
the Wait,” a middle -school abstinence -only curriculum that it developed and which it distributes to schools in  ten 
central Texa s counties, and which it markets nationwide.69   
 
Scott & White’s program is highly structured.  The curriculum materials are scripted and include outlines 
of all supplies, activities and necessary materials.  Scott & White holds a two -day seminar to train teachers and 
other school personnel who use its materials, and district -wide training for all employees in school districts that 
use its materials.  It also provides education for parents, community members and healthcare professionals 
throughout the state  of Texas.  Scott & White is also working with Time -Warner Cable to produce public service 
announcements promoting abstinence.70 
 
Laredo’s “Mi Futuro/My Future” abstinence education program is a “collaborative effort between the 
Laredo Independent School Di strict and the City of Laredo Health Department,” whereby the health department 
administers the abstinence -only grant, which it subcontracts to the school district for implementation.71  The 
program targets middle school students in four Laredo schools and,  since the 2001 -2002 school year, to freshmen 
in one Laredo high school.  Two “master teachers” coordinate the “Mi Futuro/My Future” program and monitor 
its activities and progress; five “health trainers” use the “Mi Futuro/My Future” curriculum developed by the 
program in the classroom and hold meetings and community events for parents.72  
 
The Medical Institute for Sexual Health is a nonprofit organization founded in 1992 by Dr. Joe 
McIlhaney, an Austin gynecologist, to “confront the worldwide epidemics of  nonmarital pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted disease with incisive health care data.”73  The Medical Institute produces resource materials for 
abstinence education programs, hosts national and statewide conferences and seminars on sexually transmitted 
diseases, sex education and nonmarital pregnancy and makes regular appearances at meetings of health 
professionals.   
 
The Medical Institute collaborates with both McCAP and Scott & White in their work.  It receives federal 
abstinence -only funding to hold “Ch ange Makers” seminars to “educate, equip and mobilize local community 
leaders to build community -wide consensus and to develop an action strategy —based on character 
development —for promoting abstinence from sexual activity and other risk behaviors among lo cal unmarried 
teens and young adults.”74  These seminars are directed at adult community leaders in government, education,

improve the welfare of individuals in society.”  Dr. McIlhaney told Human Rights Watch that the Medical Institute is not an 
abstinence organization, but a medical educational group that is commit ted to reducing the risk of sexually transmitted 
diseases and nonmarital pregnancy.  It supports abstinence because it is “clear that abstinence is best for adolescents and 
young adolescents.”  Human Rights Watch interview with Dr. Joe McIlhaney, May 10, 2 002. 74 Medical Institute for Sexual Health application for Section 510 abstinence education funds for fiscal year 2002, p.  C1.

VI.  IMPEDING ACCESS  TO INFORMATION ABOU T HIV/AIDS PREVENTIO N 
 
Consequences of Texas’ Abstinence Programs  
 
Restricting Information About Condoms  
 
The downfall is giving kids too many choices.  Kids have a  lot of choices, but the best choice is 
abstinence.  I guess they can go elsewhere for more information.76 
- Linda Grisham, teacher, Temple, Texas, May 6, 2002  
 
We don’t talk about HIV/AIDS prevention except to say “remain abstinent until marriage and 
once married, be monogamous with your spouse.”  We don’t talk about contraception or 
condoms because that would be crossing the line that the state or federal guidelines have set.  We 
don’t mention the word “condoms” at all.  If a student brings it up, he’s dir ected to speak with 
other people, like his parents or a counselor.77 
- Charmaine Heimes, master teacher, Laredo, Texas, May 9, 2002  
 
Texas’ federally funded abstinence -only programs restrict information on condoms because they are 
barred by federal law from  “promoting or endorsing” contraceptive use.  Texas -based abstinence -only education 
programs also contend that encouraging abstinence while also teaching about “safe sex” or “safer sex” sends a 
“mixed message” to young people that is “misleading at best an d, at worst, irresponsible.”78  These programs also 
teach that condoms don’t adequately protect against sexually transmitted diseases, particularly among teenage 
users, and therefore there is no such thing as “safe” or “safer” sex with condoms.  As a result , abstinence -only 
programs omit any discussion of condoms and contraception altogether, or provide inaccurate or misleading 
information about condoms as a method of HIV/AIDS prevention.  
 
Sally Fleming and Laura Wilson, high school health teachers from a Mc Lennan County high school that 
uses McCAP abstinence -only materials, including Teen Aid’s “Sexuality, Family and Commitment,” told Human 
Rights Watch that prior to their school’s adoption of McCAP’s abstinence -only program, they were able to talk 
about con doms and other birth control methods.  However, since the adoption of the abstinence -only curriculum, 
they are limited with respect to what they can say about contraceptives and their use.79  Fleming said, “Before 
                                                 75Ibid., pp. C1 -C2, F1 -F10. 76 Human Rights Watch interview with Linda Grisham, teacher, Temple High School, Temple, Texas, May 6 , 2002.  77 Human Rights Watch interview with Charmaine Heimes, master teacher, “Mi Futuro/My Future” Abstinence Education

Text (Spokane, WA: Teen Aid, Inc., 1995), pp. 139 -40. Studies in the United States and abroad have come to contr ary 
conclusions.  See, for example, UNAIDS, Impact of HIV and Sexual Health Education on the Sexual Behaviour of Young 
People: a Review Update  (New York: UNAIDS, 1997) (review of sixty -eight country evaluations of sex education programs 
concluded that “lit tle evidence was found to support the contention that sexual health and HIV education promote 
promiscuity… . Twenty -two [studies] reported that HIV and/or sexual health education either delayed the onset of sexual 
activity, reduced the number of sexual par tners, or reduced unplanned pregnancy and STD rates.”); Douglas Kirby, Emerging 
Answers:  Research Findings on Programs to Reduce Teen Pregnancy  (finding that sex education that discusses contraception 
does not hasten the onset of sex, increase the frequenc y of sex, nor increase the number of sexual partners); John B. Jemmott 
et al., “Abstinence and Safer Sex HIV Risk -Reduction Interventions for African American Adolescents,” Journal of the 
American Medical Association , vol. 279, no. 19, May 20, 1998, pp. 15 29-1536 (among sexually experienced youth, those in 
safer sex intervention reported less frequent intercourse than those in abstinence intervention).  79 Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Sally Fleming, May 4, 2002; Human Rights Watch interview wit h Laura 
Wilson, Waco, Texas, April 30, 2002.  Sally Fleming and Laura Wilson are pseudonyms for teachers who requested

 20McCAP, I could say, ‘If you’re not having s ex, that’s great.  If you are, you need to be careful and use condoms.’  
Boy, that went out the window.”  She expressed her concern that since her school adopted the abstinence -only 
curriculum, she has felt like she is “in a bad situation,” needing to give  her students more information about 
condoms and contraception, but restricted about what she can say.  She noted that she cannot say, “Use a condom 
to prevent getting HIV,” or “If you use condoms, your chances are better of avoiding disease,” and cannot t ell her 
students that they “need to use something to prevent HIV and STDS.” 80 
 
Fleming said that she thinks that all of the other teachers at her school would like to be able to speak more 
freely and that most parents want their children to be educated abo ut everything.  “As a health teacher, I don’t 
believe in abstinence -until-marriage education, but I worry about breaking the rules.  People here are afraid of 
being vocal because it’ll come back to bite them.  You should see how they butchered Planned Pare nthood in the 
paper.”81 
 
Laura Wilson, who teaches at the same high school as Fleming, told Human Rights Watch that before her 
school district adopted the abstinence -only curriculum, she could talk a little more about different methods of 
contraception, inc luding condoms, and how they worked.  Now she cannot talk about contraception, except to say 
that no contraceptive method is perfect because all have failure rates.  “I mention condoms like the book [Teen 
Aid’s “Sexuality, Family and Commitment”] does.  I tell them that they give a false sense of security about 
protection against STDs, because they’re not 100 percent and that condoms may prevent HIV or not, but I 
wouldn’t bet my life on it.”  She also said that the abstinence -only curriculum is “freeing” as  well as limiting.  “I 
don’t discuss things outside the book.  I don’t want to be dishonest, but I am worried about keeping my job.  
Having Teen Aid makes the choice of how to teach a controversial subject much easier.”82 
 
The message that students receive in abstinence -only classrooms is that remaining abstinent from sex is 
the only way to prevent HIV.  Sean G., a fifteen -year-old high school student who had recently completed the 
required health education class at a McCAP school, told Human Rights Watch th at “[a]t the beginning of the 
class, my teacher said that she was not going to discuss methods to inhibit transmission of diseases except for 
abstinence.”83  When asked whether he had learned how to prevent HIV, Sean replied, “other than abstinence?  
No.”84  Linda P., a sixteen -year-old student at the same high school, told Human Rights Watch, “I don’t know any 
other way but abstinence to prevent HIV,”85 a statement that was echoed by other McCAP students interviewed 
by Human Rights Watch.  
 
In some abstinence -only programs, teachers do not mention contraceptives or condoms at all, believing 
that doing so would contravene state and federal restrictions.  This is illustrated by the comments of Charmaine 
Heimes, who supervises “abstinence teachers” in Laredo Indep endent School District’s abstinence -only program 
and is quoted at the opening of this section (other teachers in the Laredo program confirmed Heimes’ statement).86  
Students in these programs who ask questions about condoms or contraceptive use are directed  to speak with their 
parents or to a counselor. (For the issue of referrals, see below.)

 21Restrictions on discussing condoms extend to teachers and other employees in school districts with 
abstinence -only programs, including those who do not themselves tea ch the federally funded abstinence -only 
classes.  Jerry Ramirez, the health teacher at Cigarroa Middle School, in Laredo, Texas, told Human Rights 
Watch that he thinks that the very high teen pregnancy rate in Laredo indicates that his students need more 
comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention education.  He doesn’t talk about HIV prevention in his classroom, though, 
because “Cigarroa [middle school] has an abstinence program.  I can’t mention condoms or birth control.  If kids 
have a question about condoms or bi rth control, I refer them to their parents or to a counselor.”  Nor does he 
discuss HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases, unless a student raises the issue.  “If a student asks a question, 
it’s usually about transmission.  I tell them that HIV is sex ually transmitted, or that you can get it from a blood 
transfusion, or through intravenous drug use.”87  Once, Ramirez caught some students with condoms at school and  
confiscated them.  When the students asked him, “Why are you taking the condoms away?  Sh ouldn’t we be using 
condoms?” Ramirez told the students that he couldn’t discuss this and advised the students that they should speak 
with their parents.88 
 
Kay Coburn, the curriculum director at Temple School District, Bell County, Texas, which has adopted  
Scott & White’s abstinence -only program and uses its materials, told Human Rights Watch that “Scott & White 
told us that if we teach anything but abstinence, they could lose their federal funding.  We don’t discuss condom 
use, except to say that condoms d on’t work.”89  Dr. Coburn told Human Rights Watch that she thinks that students 
should be given more information about protecting against HIV and that there should be somewhere kids can go 
for referrals, but that she understands that state and/or federal gu idelines limit the schools from providing this 
information.90 
 
All employees in Temple School District, including bus drivers and janitors, participate in Scott & 
White’s district -wide trainings.  Kay Coburn explained that students sometimes communicate wit h employees 
other than teachers about personal issues and, therefore,  
 
Everyone is sensitive to the abstinence message.  The idea is that if they hear kids talking about 
“these things,” they can remind them that they should be abstinent until marriage.  W e’re an 
abstinence -based district.  If the issue comes up, employees are advised to refer the student to a 
teacher and then say abstinence until marriage is the way to be and to think about what you’re 
doing.91   
 
Restricting Access to Experts on HIV/AIDS P revention  
Some of Texas’ abstinence -only programs impede students’ access to information from individuals with 
expertise on HIV/AIDS prevention, such as HIV/AIDS educators from local health departments and people in 
private organizations who provide HIV/AI DS and STD prevention education.  
 
Pam Smallwood, who spent more than twenty years as the education director of Planned Parenthood of 
Central Texas in Waco before becoming the organization’s executive director two years ago, told Human Rights 
Watch that Pla nned Parenthood and HIV/AIDS educators from the county health department used to provide 
comprehensive sex education presentations to public schools throughout McLennan County, which included 
information about condom use as a method to prevent pregnancy an d HIV/AIDS.  In the past few years, however, 
these organizations have stopped visiting many county schools. Smallwood told Human Rights Watch that as 
education director, she “used to spend most of [her] time in the schools,” but that because McCAP is in al l the 
school districts in McLennan County except Waco, Planned Parenthood now does few school presentations.  “If 
McCAP weren’t in all of those schools, Planned Parenthood and Raylene Silver [the HIV/AIDS and STD

 22educator for the Waco -McLennan County Healt h District] would be in those schools.”92  As Cheryl Cox, the 
health teacher at Robinson High School who teaches its abstinence -only curriculum, explained, Planned 
Parenthood used to come to speak to her class, “but it’s a very conservative community and th ere was a bad vibe.  
The approach here is that the less we know, the better.”93  
  
Susan Nichols, a counselor for pregnant and parenting teens at a McLennan County high school that has 
adopted McCAP’s abstinence -only curriculum, told Human Rights Watch that  “if the school would allow 
discussion of condoms, I’d rather have someone from Planned Parenthood talk with them. . . .  My job is to help 
the girls finish high school.  I’m not an expert in STDs or condom use.”94  At about the same time that Human 
Rights Watch spoke with Nichols, she invited Pat Stone, the education director of Planned Parenthood of Central 
Texas, to speak with her students about sexually transmitted diseases and birth control.  However, Nichols said 
that she soon retracted the invitation because the principal told her that the school had had some problems with 
some information that Planned Parenthood had given in the past and parents might get upset if Planned 
Parenthood came to the campus.95 
 
Although the City of Laredo Health Department, a partner in the “Mi Futuro/My Future” abstinence -only 
program, has an HIV/STD program whose staff includes health educators and prevention specialists, the 
HIV/STD program and its expertise are not incorporated into the abstinence -only program.  As Christ ina Earles, 
an HIV/AIDS educator, explained, “the schools don’t let us talk with the kids because we don’t teach abstinence 
but prevention.”96 
 
Manuel Sanchez, the program coordinator for the City of Laredo’s HIV/STD program, told Human Rights 
Watch, “in no  way are we allowed to go into the schools” because the schools have their own funding to provide 
services related to HIV.  “But this is just in theory.  In fact, no HIV education is taking place.”97  School nurses 
have told Sanchez that the HIV message to students is that there is no cure for HIV, so that they should be 
abstinent and that they cannot talk about safer sex because that would be considered as promoting sex.98   
 
Nurses in Laredo high schools have asked Sanchez to come to Laredo schools to provi de HIV education, 
but, as he has explained to the nurses, they must first get permission from the schools and then he would discuss 
this with the Texas Department of Health, which is his department’s funding agency.  None of the nurses have yet 
contacted h im with such permission.  In any event, Sanchez told Human Rights Watch that it might be difficult to 
get permission from the Texas Department of Health to do HIV prevention in schools because the Texas 
Education Agency gives funding to the school district s to provide this kind of service.  Moreover, he would need 
the school board’s and parents’ permission before he could teach HIV prevention in the schools.99 
 
                                                 92 Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Pam Smallwood, May 6, 2002.  Smallwood contends that several factors 
contributed to the decline in invitations for Planned Paren thood to speak in schools in the past ten years: the fact that Planned 
Parenthood began providing abortions eight years ago; the rise of the religious right; the pressure on teachers to focus on 
subjects tested on statewide competency exams; and the increa sing pressure on schools to provide some sort of sex education.  
“McCAP came along at a perfect time.  They promised to train teachers, provide materials and do it in a palatable way.”

Planned Parenthood about STDs and contraception, which she reviewed with her students herself.  She felt constrained, 
however, from handing out this information to the students: “I didn’t want to make a huge bunch of wa ves, so I just got a 
pamphlet from Planned Parenthood and talked about it with my students.  I didn’t want to hand out any pamphlets to the 
students.  I didn’t think that the school would be real pleased about that.”  Ibid.  96 Human Rights Watch interview w ith Christina Earles, peer educator, HIV/STD Program, City of Laredo Health

 23Sanchez’ experience at the health department suggests that Laredo students are not getting suffici ent 
information about HIV.  The health department periodically has interns from local high schools come for one to 
two weeks.  According to Sanchez, many of them are hungry for information about HIV/AIDS and volunteer to 
work with the HIV/STD program.100 
 
In May 2000, Raylene Silver, an HIV/AIDS educator with the Waco -McLennan County Health District, 
was invited to do a presentation to Cheryl Cox’s high school health class in Robinson, Texas.  Prior to the class, 
Silver was told that she would be allowed to p ass out information about birth control, so she brought pamphlets 
produced by the Texas Department of Health to distribute to the students.  When she arrived at the classroom, 
however, Cox told her, “We can’t talk about birth control or prevention of HIV o r STDs by using condoms.  
We’re a McCAP school.”  Cox told Silver that she could put the birth control pamphlets on her desk but that she 
couldn’t hand them out and that the students would have to ask for them specifically if they wanted one.  Thus 
caution ed, Silver was limited to telling the students “If you know anyone who is sexually active, they’ve got to 
take responsibility and use protection.”101 
 
In May 2002, Cox told Human Rights Watch that she would have to get permission from the principal for 
an HI V educator to bring pamphlets about birth control into the classroom.102  Subsequently, Sharon Henson, the 
lead chair of the Robinson’s school health education advisory council and an assistant principal at Robinson High 
School, told Human Rights Watch that she was “very pleased with McCAP,” and that teaching abstinence -until-
marriage “is what the school board and the community want.”  She said that the school was “not going to get into 
birth control,” and that they didn’t discuss “safe sex,” but “save sex” – that is, save sex until marriage.  Henson 
also cautioned Human Rights Watch, “I hope you’re not out to hurt McCAP in any way.  We’re very pleased with 
what they’ve brought in.”103  
 
Misinformation About Condoms  
 There is a broad scientific consensus, includ ing among federal health agencies, that condoms, when used 
correctly and consistently, are highly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS.104  Some Texas 
abstinence -only programs obscure this important fact and provide misleading information abo ut the efficacy of 
condoms in protecting against transmission of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.   
 
McCAP’s media campaign includes public service announcements on radio and television that advise as 
follows:  
 
You may have heard people s ay “the truth hurts” . . . but what about lies?

condoms can reduce the risk of gonorrhea transmission fr om women to men and of genital warts and cervical neoplasia, 
conditions associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, but that epidemiological evidence was insufficient to 
assess condom effectiveness in preventing transmission of gonorrhea from me n to women, syphilis, chlamydial infection,

The study further stressed that “the absence of definitive conclusions reflected inadequacie s of the evidence available and 
should not be interpreted as proof of the adequacy or inadequacy of the condom to reduce the risk of STDs other than HIV 
transmission in men and women and gonorrhea in men.”  Ibid., p. ii.

McCAP’s “Truth for Youth” advertisement campaign teaches adolescents that condoms don’t work.  A 
Planned Parenthood employee told Human Rights Watch that after watching a “Truth for Youth” commercial 
with her teenage daughter, her daughter turned to her and said, “Mom, I thought that you told me that if I used 
condoms, it would help protect me against pregnancy, HIV and STDs.  Why are you telling me this?”  Her 
daughter also told her that many of her high s chool classmates had heard the “Truth for Youth” commercials and 
that some of the boys at school said that they didn’t think that they had to use condoms any more when they had 
sex because condoms would not protect them or their partners.  Teenage patients  at Planned Parenthood also have 
told this employee that they heard on television that “condoms aren’t as safe as everybody seems to think” and 
“my boyfriend says they don’t work.  He heard it on the radio.”107   
 
McCAP’s media campaign regarding “lies about  condoms” apparently undermines condom use even 
among adults.  Raylene Silver, an HIV/AIDS educator in McLennan County, told Human Rights Watch that an 
adult injecting drug user told her that he did not use condoms because he heard on television that condo ms don’t 
work.108 
 
McCAP reinforces the message that condoms don’t work with pamphlets that instruct, “Danger . . . 
Beware . . . STDs are not prevented with condom use: 1) some STDs transmit skin to skin; 2) condoms have a 
17% failure rate; that’s 1 in 6,”109 and by providing curriculum materials to schools that report that a “meticulous 
review of condom effectiveness” found that condoms “appear to reduce the risk of heterosexual transmission of 
HIV infection by only 69 %,”110 that condoms break or slip as much a s 25.5 percent of the time,111 and that 
“published reports indicate that condoms are effective in reducing the risk of contracting HIV about 55 to 90 
percent of the time.”112

 25Becky Mosby, the education director at McCAP, told Human Rights Watch that McCAP di scusses 
contraception in terms of “human use reality rates.”  “I’m not going to tell you what the condom company says 
the rate is, because they’re selling a product, so they’ll promote it in the best light possible.”  And, “human use 
reality rates” are poo r for teens and even for those at obvious risk of HIV infection.  According to Mosby, “teens 
who use condoms consistently and every time they have sex are more likely to stop using condoms.  And there’s a 
huge study that shows where one married partner has  HIV, they don’t use condoms consistently.”113  Other Texas 
abstinence -only programs also emphasize adolescents’ poor history of condom use.114  However, even were they 
so inclined, these programs cannot address this concern by providing instruction regarding proper condom use 
because they are barred by federal law from “promoting or endorsing” contraception or otherwise providing 
information inconsistent with the federal abstinence -only guidelines.115  
 
Sally Fleming, who teaches in a McLennan County school that  uses McCAP materials, expressed concern 
about exaggerated ineffectiveness information provided to students by McCAP:  
 
I can tell my students that there’s a lot of data that says that condoms aren’t effective in 
preventing disease and pregnancy.  But when someone from McCAP comes and tells the students 
that condoms have a 77 percent failure rate, or something like that, I tell them that that’s not 
correct.  I say that they can get statistics from Planned Parenthood and from McCAP about 
condoms’ effectivenes s and that they need to be aware where the information is coming from.116 
 
 “Sex is Not a Game,” a video produced by the Medical Institute for Sexual Health (Austin, Texas), 
includes information about sexually transmitted diseases and their incidence among y oung people.  Discussion of 
condoms is limited to the advisory that “Condoms aren’t much good against the most common sexual infection 
anyway.  Condoms provide limited, if any, protection against HPV [human papilloma virus, a sexually 
transmitted disease]. ”117   
 
Another Medical Institute publication suggests that condoms may “seem” to prevent HIV, but HIV’s “low 
infectivity,” rather than condom use, may explain some of the purported effectiveness of condoms:  
 
[G]eneralizing condom effectiveness from diseases  with low infectivities (for example, HIV) and 
using these results to predict condom effectiveness in diseases with higher infectivities (for

They can slip or break, they must be used absolutely correctly and consistent ly 100% of the time (the CDC reports 7 steps to 
proper condom usage) and even if they are used consistently and correctly, condoms provide limited (if any) protection 
against some STDs, including HPV.  HPV causes over 99% of all cervical cancer in women.  93% of clinically significant 
pre-cancerous lesions detected by Pap smears contain high risk strains of HPV.”  Discussion Guide accompanying Sex is Not 
a Game (Austin, Texas: Medical Institute for Sexual Health, 2001), p. 4.   
In Building Healthy Futures: Tools for Helping Adolescents Avoid or Delay the Onset of Sexual Activity , the 
Medical Institute asserts that “condom promotion is typically conducted under the banner of HIV prevention.  For this 
purpose they are reasonably effective.  For other STIs, how ever, they are less effective.  Since these other STIs are more 
common than HIV among adolescents, condom promotion as a primary strategy makes little sense.  Adolescents remain 
susceptible to the most common STIs, even if they use condoms.”  Joshua Mann e t al., Building Healthy Futures: Tools for 
Helping Adolescents Avoid or Delay the Onset of Sexual Activity  (Austin, Texas: The Medical Institute for Sexual Health, 
2000), p. 14.

 26example, gonorrhea, chlamydia) is not an honest or valid generalization. . . . Most STDs are more 
infectious than HIV.  In fact, the very low infectivity of HIV —even when condoms are not 
used—partially explains why condoms seem to prevent HIV infection.  In this situation, at least a 
portion of the reported condom “effectiveness” is due to the small chance of contract ing HIV 
during a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected partner even if condoms are not used.118 
 
Dr. McIlhaney told Human Rights Watch that he mentions condoms as a method of reducing the risk of 
HIV, but also says that once infected, it’s for l ife and you’ll probably die from AIDS or something else.  He also 
advises that “anyone infected with HIV needs to consider never having sex again (at least not penetrative sex) 
because you can transmit HIV even using condoms.”119 
 
Linda Grisham, a science te acher at Temple High School who is working on Scott & White’s new ninth 
grade curriculum, told Human Rights Watch that she plans to use an activity she learned at a recent teacher 
training to show how condoms are not effective.  Participants are given cut -up pieces of plastic or latex of 
different strengths and thicknesses and asked to identify which one is a condom, a rubber glove, or a plastic bag.  
“We were shown how condoms were one of the thinnest kinds of plastic [sic] and how easy they were to break 
with a fingernail.”120 
 
Grisham explained that her HIV prevention curriculum promotes abstinence until marriage as the “way to 
go.”  
 
Look at condoms: they don’t work.  I show the percentages of times that condoms don’t work and 
tell the students that most k ids that use condoms don’t use them correctly, because they puncture 
them, or don’t put them on all the way.  I allow kids to know that maybe condoms will help, but 
they’re not 100 percent safe.  I try not to tell them that “it’s better than nothing.”  Con doms are 
not safe sex, because it doesn’t prevent against sexually transmitted diseases.121   
 
Dr. Patricia Sulak told Human Rights Watch, “I tell kids that condoms are effective in reducing the risk of 
HIV if used every time and before genital -to-genital co ntact.  They will reduce the risk of HIV, but not other 
diseases.  I tell them that they have to decide if condoms are good enough for them, given the percentages.  I don’t 
teach the sixteen steps of condom use or how to use them.”122 
 
Pledging Virginity to Prevent Disease, and “Renewed Virginity”  
All of the programs that Human Rights Watch visited in Texas included a “virginity pledge” as a part of 
their respective programs.  These pledges are included as part of the abstinence -only school curricula.123   Some  
programs also hold public virginity pledge ceremonies at which students vow before their parents and other 
community members to remain virgins until marriage.  McCAP, for example, hosts “A Night to Last a Lifetime,” 
                                                 118 The Medical Institute for Sexual Health, Sexual Health Update , Fall 2000, p.  2. 119 Human Rights Watch interview with Dr. Joe McIlhaney, May 10, 2002.  120 Human Rights Watch interview with Linda Grisham, May 6, 2002.  121 Ibid.  122 Human Rights Watch interview with Dr. Patricia Sulak, May 1, 2002.  123 McCAP distributes “Abstinence ‘til Marri age (ATM)” cards, which state that “The person whose signature appears above 
agrees to the ATM (Abstinence ‘til Marriage) terms.  Sex outside of marriage is an indebtedness that can produce negative 
returns (i.e., STD’s,  pregnancy, abortion, unwanted memo ries and/or broken heart) and all assets can be potentially lost 
(death), however the returns of an investment in an ATM can yield greater respect for yourself, others and your future 
husband/wife.  Adherence to the conditions of this ATM card can yield gr eater rates of return in fidelity between couples in 
future mergers and acquisitions (marriage).”  Scott & White’s “Abstinence pledge card” reads, “Starting today, I __________ 
commit to abstain from sexual activity until marriage.  I understand this is th e only proven way to protect myself from 
premarital pregnancy and giving someone an STD.  I respect myself and choose to wait.”  The “Mi Futuro/My Future” 
pledge card reads, “I’m saving myself for my future marriage partner.  I give myself the freedom to m ake abstinent choices, 
to ignore all negative pressures and to enjoy my years as a teenager safe from the risks of premarital sex and all its expected 
outcomes.”   
Human Rights Watch   September 2002, Vol. 14,No.5 (G)
 27an evening ceremony in which adolescent s publicly pledge “before God . . . to avoid all risk behaviors, knowing 
that choosing to participate in any of them could lead me to a path of confusion and isolation,” and to remain 
sexually abstinent until marriage.124  Laredo likewise includes a pledge t o remain abstinent until marriage as part 
of its parent/child weekend meeting sessions.125 
  
Programs offer two kinds of advice to sexually active youth: first, that they should commit to “secondary” 
or “renewed virginity” to protect against HIV and other se xually transmitted diseases; and second, that they 
should go to the doctor and get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  
 
Linda Grisham tells students that “if you’re sexually active, you can change your life and from here on in, 
‘do the  right thing and not have sex.’  There’s still an opportunity to have a second virginity and save your 
future.”  She also tells them that “if you’re sexually active, you need to see a doctor and get tested for HIV” and 
other sexually transmitted diseases.126  Barbara Ducote likewise includes “second chance” virginity among HIV 
and pregnancy prevention strategies, telling her students that they “may have committed a sexual act in the past, 
but now commit to monogamy.”127   
 
This message also appears in the liter ature produced and distributed by abstinence -only organizations.  
For example, a pamphlet distributed by McCAP and produced by the Medical Institute advises, “So you’ve 
already had sex . . . . [S]et up an appointment with your doctor . . . .  Claim your se condary virginity with pride 
today.”128   
 
Amy Cavender, a sexuality educator with Community Health Services in San Marcos, Texas, told Human 
Rights Watch that she is concerned that sexually active youth who have pledged “secondary virginity” may not 
seek th e health care they need, believing that once they’ve signed the pledge, they’ll be protected from both past 
and future infection.   
 
Kids have told me that “I’m a virgin now, so I don’t have to worry about sexually transmitted 
diseases any more.”  I’m conc erned that kids who have been sexually active aren’t seeking the 
health care that they need, because if there’s nothing obviously wrong with them at the point that 
they’ve taken the pledge, they’re looking to the future and not considering that they may ha ve 
acquired an infection in the past.129  
 
Likewise, absent more complete advice about the role of testing in HIV prevention —that is, that HIV 
testing can rule out past risk and is not a prevention strategy in and of itself —advising sexually active students to 
get tested may actually put individuals at risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  A 
recent study of the role of HIV testing in HIV prevention reported that more than 40 percent of women who 
participated in the study believed t hat getting tested is a good way to prevent  HIV, and that receiving a negative 
test had no influence on safer sex behavior.130  Other studies have reached similar conclusions.131  In addition, 
                                                 124 In 2001, McCAP collaborated to produce “A Night to Last a Lifetime” with five local churche s, who “came together to 
honor parents and teens in the exchange of vows and commitment to sexual purity.”  McCAP, A Collaborator’s Guide , at 3 -

 28students need to understand that there is a period of time after e xposure during which HIV infection may not be 
detectable by HIV tests (the “window period”) and therefore an HIV -infected person may receive a negative test 
result during this period.  
 
There also is evidence that adolescents who pledge virginity may ultima tely be at increased risk of 
HIV/AIDS infection.  A study of virginity pledges often cited by abstinence -only groups found that although there 
is some evidence that these pledges delay intercourse by an average of eighteen months, as virginity pledges 
become the norm, they lose their allure and thus their effect.  This study also found that virginity pledges have the 
unintended effect of placing some teens at higher risk of unintended pregnancy and STDs, because teens who 
break the pledge are one -third less  likely than nonpledgers to use contraceptives once they do become sexually 
active.132   
 
Referrals for Other Information  
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the abstinence -only education 
programs, advises that if a participan t asks for information about contraception, an abstinence -only program can 
provide a referral to a third party (such as a health department) for more information, but that referrals should be 
given in response to a question and not as part of the regular p rogram.133   
 
In practice, teachers in abstinence -only programs have varied practices with respect to the referrals they 
make.  As already noted, teachers in Laredo’s “Mi Futuro/My Future” programs do not discuss condoms at all.  If 
asked about condoms, they  advise students to speak to their parents or to a counselor for more information.134  
Linda Grisham, a Temple High School teacher, told Human Rights Watch that if a student asked where to get 
condoms, she would say, “this is not what I am promoting.  Abstin ence is what you should be supporting,” and 
would also tell the student to speak with his or her parents and, perhaps, with a doctor or a counselor.135  Barbara 
Ducote, who teaches at a Temple Middle School, told Human Rights Watch that if a student asked wh ere to get 
condoms, she would send him to one of the local health clinics.  She also provides the numbers of the local rape 
hotline, health clinic and free clinic to the students and encourages students to talk privately with her or a 
counselor if they hav e questions.136 
 
Crowding Out Other Sources of AIDS Information  
Abstinence -only-until-marriage programs crowd out other sources of HIV/AIDS prevention information 
for children.  Texas’ commitment to abstinence -only education has affected HIV prevention educa tion that is 
provided through programs funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Other states’ 
commitment to abstinence -only education has influenced the decision to refuse federal funding for school health 
HIV/AIDS prevention progra ms altogether or to condition the acceptance of federal HIV/AIDS prevention funds 
on compliance with strict abstinence -only guidelines.

Intercourse,” American Journal of Sociology,  vol. 106, no. 4 (2001), pp. 859 -912.  That pled gers “are less likely to be 
prepared for an experience that they have promised to forgo . . . suggests that pledgers, like other adolescents, may benefit 
from knowledge about contraception and pregnancy risk, even if it appears at the time that they do not  need such 
knowledge.”  Ibid, p. 900.  133 Human Rights Watch interview with Michele Lawler, director, Abstinence Education Program, U.S. Department of

to a school -based counselor has any practical significance for students in schools with abstinence -only programs.  As 
discussed above, counselors and other school -based health professionals may feel constrained to censor infor mation about 
condoms and contraception.  135 Human Rights Watch interview with Linda Grisham, May 6, 2002.  136 Human Rights Watch interview with Barbara Ducote, May 6, 2002.

 29Since 1987, the CDC has provided funds and technical assistance to state, county and large -city education 
agencies fo r HIV prevention education.137  These funds are distributed via a grant program that funds HIV 
prevention education (the “ CDC HIV/AIDS grant” or “HIV grant”); expanded health education that addresses 
other priority health risks (such as prevention of tobacc o use, prevention of heart disease, diabetes and cancer and 
promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors); and national training and demonstration centers for HIV prevention, 
chronic disease and local education agency support.138  All applicants must apply speci fically for the HIV grant 
and only those programs that are approved for the HIV grant qualify for funding for the other programs.139  In 
2002, the CDC received about $50 million to support HIV prevention education in forty -eight states, seven 
territories and  nineteen large metropolitan areas.140   
 
The CDC school health education funds are intended to be used to support state and local school health 
initiatives: “to expand and strengthen the capacity of [state and local education agencies] to plan, carry out an d 
evaluate coordinated school health programs, to address significant health problems that affect young persons 
(especially HIV infection, tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle and dietary patterns that result in disease).”141  The 
CDC grantmaking guidelines requ ire that AIDS -related written, audiovisual and pictorial materials used by grant 
recipients include information about the benefits of abstinence.142  Grant recipients are not, however, bound by 
CDC guidelines that recommend that adolescents be provided with information about the proper use of condoms 
to reduce the risk of HIV infection.143  In addition, grantees must still comply with their respective state education 
regulations.  Texas schools, for example, must follow Texas’ abstinence -only legislation.144   
 
Texas’ state education agency (the Texas Education Agency or TEA) receives about $300,000 annually in 
HIV grant funds  for the state of Texas.  TEA spends about one third of these funds on administration and 
distributes the remainder to twenty regional “Edu cation Service Centers,” which each receive between $5,000 and 
                                                 137 The CDC’s technical assistance includes assisting schools in policy development and with the development and 
dissemination of materials and resources, training teachers and other school personnel, monitoring prevalence of risk 
behaviors among students and the status of HIV education in different jurisdictions, and evaluating the impact of  programs 
and activities.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Program Announcement Number 805: School Health Programs to

 30$8,000 to spend on HIV prevention activities.145  Dallas and Houston each get separate funding under the same 
grant.146 
 
Texas began receiving CDC funds for school health programs for HIV/AIDS prev ention in 1988.  In 
1995, the Texas Education Agency decided not to seek further funding from the CDC for school health programs 
for HIV/AIDS prevention, thereby forgoing $1.35 million ($450,000 for three years) in CDC funding.147  Texas 
Education Commission er Mike Moses made this decision out of his concern that CDC requirements would 
conflict with Texas’ new education code, which requires that course materials and instruction emphasize 
abstinence from sexual activity “as the only method that is 100% effecti ve in preventing pregnancy, sexually 
transmitted diseases,” HIV/AIDS, and the “emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity,” and 
which gives local school districts greater responsibility for their curricula.148   
 
Despite Moses’ concern, the grant guidelines do not promote or prohibit any specific instruction or 
methodology, but state that  
 
Recipients of funding are responsible for conducting activities that establish, strengthen, or 
expand HIV and STD prevention education and integrating such  education into existing 
comprehensive school education. . . .  Applicants are expected to assist school districts/local 
schools in developing, strengthening and implementing planned, sequential, skills -based 
comprehensive school health curricula intended to prevent behaviors that will result in HIV/STD 
infection.149   
 
Commissioner Moses reportedly notified the CDC that Texas would accept the CDC HIV/AIDS 
prevention grant if the CDC provided written assurance that Texas school districts would be allowed to t each the 
abstinence -only curriculum.150  Moses ultimately decided to accept the CDC HIV/AIDS funding, telling the state 
Board of Education that he  changed his mind about the grant after receiving assurances from the CDC that the

 31grant would not require Texas  schools to teach a specific health curriculum.151  George W. Bush, then Texas 
governor, praised Moses’ actions, stating “He accomplished exactly what he set out to do, and as a result, Texas 
schools will get federal funds without federal mandates on how to teach health education.”152 
 
For the past several years, Texas’ statewide regional CDC HIV/AIDS prevention grants have mostly 
funded workshops about school health education advisory councils (such as how to set up a council), which are 
mandated by law to adv ise school boards regarding curriculum materials on sexuality education and education on 
HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.153  Otherwise the CDC HIV/AIDS grant has funded 
abstinence education trainings and trainings on the development of “ref usal skills.”154 
 
Tommy Fleming, director of health and physical education, Division of Curriculum and Professional 
Development at the TEA, who oversees the administration of the statewide CDC HIV/AIDS grant, told Human 
Rights Watch that in the early 1990s, he worked with TEA to provide comprehensive workshops on HIV/AIDS 
prevention for public school teachers, school nurses and school administrators.  These workshops advised that 
abstinence was the best prevention against HIV but also included instruction abo ut condoms as a method of HIV 
prevention.  Fleming hasn’t given this kind of presentation (that is, including instruction about condom use as a 
means of HIV prevention) since at least 1995 and expressed doubt that any such information about condoms was 
being provided by the regional Educational Service Centers, except, perhaps, in Dallas and Houston.  Fleming 
attributes this change in focus in part to the state’s conservative views about sexuality education, as well as the 
1995 Texas state law giving local school districts control over sexuality education and education about HIV/AIDS 
and other sexually transmitted diseases.155 
 
Tamara Rhodes, an HIV/AIDS educator for the Region 16 Education Service Center, told Human Rights 
Watch that she plans to use the CDC HIV/AIDS grant funds to teach refusal skills and hold a training for school 
health education advisory councils on health problems in the area, including teen pregnancy and HIV/AIDS.  She 
told Human Rights Watch that in her HIV/AIDS presentations, she does not teach about condoms as part of HIV 
prevention because she has been advised by school nurses that school administrators in her area won’t allow her 
to do so and because of community concerns that people should remain abstinent until marriage to prevent 
pregnancy and disease.156 
 
Clara Contreras, a health specialist for the Region 1 Education Service Center, which covers Laredo, has 
used the CDC HIV/AIDS grant to teach refusal skills and “self -control” in middle and elementary schools and has 
given training  about school health education advisory councils.  She also conducts HIV training for adult 
professionals in the schools.  Contreras told Human Rights Watch “when I mention condoms, it’s very brief.  
Some schools, like the abstinence -only schools, are not allowed to give out resources (like referrals to clinics or 
information about condoms or about the clinics).”  This year, she would like to hold a skill development training, 
in which she will mention “very briefly that condoms may reduce the risk of HIV, but they can break.  For that

the CDC, told Human Rights Watch that there was no conflict between the federal requirements and Texas state law.  The 
CDC pointed out to Moses the language in the grant that supported the state’s flexi bility to carry out HIV/AIDS prevention 
programs.  Human Rights Watch telephone interview with Pete Hunt, team leader, Division of Adolescent Health Services,

unless the SHAC [school health education advisory council] allows them to.”157 
 
Like Texas, other states’ abstinence -only policies have influenced their use of federal funding for 
HIV/AIDS prevention education.  Ohio’s commitment to abstinence -only education has influenced its decision to 
refuse federal funding for school health HIV/AIDS prevention programs altogether si nce 2000 out of concern that 
the funds would support programs that interfere with that commitment, while Nebraska has applied its state 
abstinence -only guidelines to programs funded by the CDC HIV/AIDS school health prevention grant.   
 
Previously, Ohio re ceived about $800,000 per year in CDC health education funding for both HIV/AIDS 
prevention and for a comprehensive school health education program that included funding for prevention 
education for heart disease, cancer and diabetes, programs to improve n utrition and increase physical activity, and 
antitobacco programs.  In June 1999, the Ohio legislature passed an amendment to a state budget bill that 
prevented the Department of Education from spending CDC health education funding on sex education until t he 
legislature held hearings approving a model health curriculum for the state.158  According to Rep. Jim Jordan, the 
Ohio legislator who pushed for the law that froze the money, “the goal of the hearings [was] to clarify that sex ed 
programs should emphasiz e abstinence” and to find out why the Education Department had accepted an 
HIV/AIDS training program that included information about contraceptive use.159   
 
In January 2000, the legislature held two days of hearings.  At the start of the hearings, an announ cement 
was made that the Department of Education was planning to submit a workplan to the CDC that would require 
that HIV/AIDS education be provided consistent with abstinence -only education.160  After two days of hearings, 
no vote was taken and in March, an  Ohio House of Representatives committee tabled the issue.161  As a result, the 
state Department of Education could not submit a workplan to the CDC and therefore could not receive any of the 
CDC health education funds.  Because approval of the HIV/AIDS fund ing was required for approval of the 
funding for expanded school health education, once the state Department of Education could not accept the 
HIV/AIDS education grant, it could not accept funding to support other programs supported by the grant.162  
Consequ ently, in rejecting the HIV/AIDS prevention money, the state also rejected thousands of dollars that were 
earmarked to support programs directed at education related to chronic diseases and other serious health 
problems.    Ohio still receives no CDC healt h education funding under these grants.163  
 
Since 1997, Nebraska has had a strict state school board policy that mandates that all state -sponsored 
health education comply with federal abstinence -only guidelines.164  Until 2001, the CDC -funded HIV education 
program there was exempt from these guidelines.  When this exemption was brought to the attention of members 
of the state Board of Education in 2001, they asked the HIV prevention coordinator to draft and defend a policy

and the sexual transmission of a virus that causes acquired imm unodeficiency syndrome.”  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §

 33that officially exempted the HIV prog ram from the abstinence -only guidelines.165  An HIV/AIDS prevention 
policy was proposed that would allow the Nebraska Department of Education to provide schools with a program 
that was not exclusively abstinence -only, but abstinence -based (that is, teach stu dents about both abstinence and 
safer sex, including condom use).  After holding hearings to consider the policy, the Board voted 4 -4 on a motion 
to allow the HIV program to be abstinence -based; since the vote was a tie, the proposed “abstinence -based” pol icy 
was rejected.166  The Board then adopted a new policy that requires that HIV/AIDS education be limited to grades 
kindergarten through six, instead of kindergarten through twelve; be used to provide teacher training only and not 
classroom education to stu dents; and comply with abstinence -only guidelines mandated for sexuality education.167   
 
The Commissioner of the Department of Education initially stated that the department would not renew 
its CDC grant when it expired in November 2001 because it could not  find any abstinence -only curricula that  did 
not include religious references and did not discuss condoms or other birth control options.168  The Department of 
Education ultimately decided to accept the funding, which it plans to use to assist local school districts in 
determining how to carry out HIV prevention education consistent with the required abstinence -only strategy and 
to find materials that reinforce abstinence as a method of HIV prevention.169   
 
Federal Review of HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs  
Since  2001, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) has been auditing federally funded HIV/AIDS prevention programs.  An initial audit was conducted in 
the fall of 2001 in response to concerns raised by Con gressman Mark Souder (Republican -Indiana) regarding 
CDC funding of several “questionable events over the past several years dubbed as HIV ‘prevention’ programs’” 
at San Francisco’s Stop AIDS Project, Inc.170  The audit concluded, among other things, that Sto p AIDS used 
some of its CDC funding for HIV prevention workshops and materials that could be construed as obscene and 
encouraging sexual activity, in violation of CDC guidelines.171  DHHS’ audit of Stop AIDS prompted Secretary 
Thompson to order a review of D HHS -funded HIV/AIDS activities “to assess the need for enhanced 
accountability and performance measures in these activities” and to have DHHS’ Office of the Inspector General 
“conduct a more comprehensive review of CDC’s HIV/AIDS program activities focusin g specifically on 
appropriate use of Federal funds, effectiveness of the programs, and whether program review panels are carrying 
out their duties as prescribed.”172   
 
The Department of Health and Human Services also is reviewing the federal government’s fi nancial 
support of sixteen prominent AIDS advocacy organizations whose members joined in a loud protest of Secretary 
Thompson’s July 2002 address at the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona.  This review was initiated 
after twelve members of Congress , including Mark Souder, wrote to DHHS requesting that the agency provide an 
accounting of all U.S. federal assistance for the conference and the names and affiliations of individuals who 
attended the conference with federal assistance, and following an el ectronic mail request to DHHS by a staffer for

Agencies engaged in HIV/AIDS prevention work have expressed concern that the federal audits and 
reviews have a chilling effect on prevention campaigns.  According to Len Pap pas, the president of Better World 
Advertising, the threat of audits has caused some of the company’s AIDS prevention clients to censor themselves 
and tone down their advertising campaigns because they don't want to be singled out for scrutiny in the new r ound 
of audits.174  Darlene Weide, the executive director of Stop AIDS, believes that the government audit of 
prevention projects is likely to have a negative impact on programs that target youth and men who have sex with 
men, particularly if they use specif ic sexual terminology and street language to get the message across.  “This 
investigation can have very serious and dangerous consequences.  The biggest consequence is that people’s lives 
are in danger, and this is not the time to threaten prevention spend ing.”175  Robert Dabney, communications 
director for the National Minority AIDS Council, which provides assistance to 400 AIDS organizations in the 
African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American Communities and which has been asked by DHHS to 
document  its spending at the Barcelona conference, likewise reported his fear that audits of his organization will 
have a chilling affect on the organizations that it assists.176  
 
 
VII.  DISCRIMINATION  BASED ON GENDER AND  SEXUAL ORIENTATION  
 
Lesbian, gay, and bisex ual school -age youth in the United States are frequently subjected to violence, 
harassment and discrimination at school, as Human Rights Watch has documented elsewhere.177  Lesbian, gay and 
bisexual youth, confronted with the stress of dealing with such trea tment on a regular basis, have been shown in 
some settings to be more likely than their heterosexual peers to use alcohol or other drugs and engage in sexual 
behaviors that put them at risk of HIV/AIDS.178  Young men who have sex with men face a significant risk of 
HIV/AIDS infection, as HIV/AIDS incidence and prevalence among young men who have sex with men remains 
high.179

HIV/AIDS and sex education that addresses the sensitivities of lesbian, gay and bisexual youth has been 
associated with a reduction in h igh-risk sexual behavior among this population.  A recent study rated fifty -nine 
schools according to the extent to which teachers perceived the HIV instruction provided in the schools to be 
sensitive and appropriate to the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexu al students.  The study found that lesbian, gay and 
bisexual students in schools who received a “high” level of gay -sensitive instruction were less likely to have had 
sex in the previous three months, had fewer sexual partners, and were less likely to have  used alcohol or drugs 
prior to last sexual intercourse than lesbian, gay and bisexual students who received “none or minimal” or a low 
level of gay -sensitive instruction.180  The study noted that effective prevention programs for lesbian, gay and 
bisexual s tudents are characterized by “inclusive instruction, adequate support services, acknowledgment of 
diversity, and a nondiscriminatory school climate.”181 
 
By definition, however, federally funded abstinence -only programs cannot provide HIV/AIDS or 
comprehensi ve sex education that respects the rights and needs of gay, lesbian and bisexual youth.  As already 
noted, federal law requires that federally funded abstinence -only education programs must either teach that a 
“mutually faithful monogamous relationship in context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual 
activity”; that “sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and 
physical effects”; and that “ bearing children out -of-wedlock is likely to have harm ful consequences for the child, 
the child's parents, and society”;  or not provide any information inconsistent with this instruction.182  Under 
federal law, “marriage” is limited to “a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife”; nor 
can individuals of the same sex legally marry in any state in the U.S.183 
 
In many states, state legislation or policies exacerbate antigay bias regarding HIV/AIDS and sexuality 
education by barring the discussion of homosexuality altogether except in the context  of sexually transmitted 
diseases, banning instruction that homosexuality is acceptable, or requiring instruction that homosexuality is 
unacceptable and illegal.184 
                                                 180 Susan M. Blake et al., “Preventing Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Adolescents: The Benefits 
of Gay -Sensitive H IV Instruction in Schools,” American Journal of Public Health , vol. 91, no. 6, June 2001 pp. 940 -946.  
Lesbian, gay and bisexual students in the latter schools were also more likely than their heterosexual schoolmates and than 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and he terosexual students with moderate or high levels of gay -sensitive instruction to report becoming 
or getting someone pregnant, having a higher number of recent sexual partners, making a plan to commit suicide, missing 
school for personal safety reasons, and  having property damaged or stolen.  p. 942.  181 Ibid., p. 940.  182 SPRANS -CBAE programs must emphasize all of these elements.  AFLA and Section 510(b) programs need not place 
equal emphasis on all of them but cannot provide any information inconsistent with t hem.  183 See Defense of Marriage Act, Pub. L. 104 -199, 110 Stat. 2419 (1996) (defining “marriage” and “spouse”).  Nor is any 
state, territory or possession of the United States, or any Indian tribe required to give effect to a same -sex relationship that is 
treated as a marriage under the laws of another state, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such 
relationship.  Ibid.  A report written for the U.S. House Judiciary Committee identified 1,049 federal laws classified in the 
Unite d States Code in which marital status is a factor.  U.S. General Accounting Office, Defense of Marriage Act: Categories 
of Laws Involving Marital Status, Letter Report GAO/OGC -97-16, January 1997.  Vermont permits same -sex couples to get 
“civil union” lice nses that subject parties to the same legal responsibilities and protections as married couples in Vermont but 
restricts “marriage” to a union between a man and a woman.  Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15 §§ 1201 et seq (2002).   184 See, for example, S.C. Code Ann. § 59-32-30(A)(5) (barring discussion of “alternate sexual lifestyles from heterosexual 
relationships including, but not limited to, homosexual relationships except in the context of instruction concerning sexually 
transmitted disease”); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.  § 15 -1716 (proscribing schools from including in their course of study about 
AIDS “instruction which: 1. Promotes a homosexual life -style. 2. Portrays homosexuality as a positive alternative life -style. 
3. Suggests that some methods of sex are safe method s of homosexual sex”); Ala. Code § 16 -40A-2 (requiring programs on 
sex education or human reproduction to include, at a minimum, “[a]n emphasis, in a factual manner and from a public health 
perspective, that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to t he general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal 
offense under the laws of the state”); see also Tex. Health & Safety Code § 163.002(8) (recommending that the state’s model 
public health education curriculum include emphasis, provided in a “fact ual manner and from a public health perspective, that 
homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offence”).   
 These types of restrictions are also contrary to American School Health Associat ion policy, which recommends that 
“curriculum materials, teaching strategies, and school policies that do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation

To comply with their mandate, abstinence -only programs either must avoid any positive or eve n neutral 
discussion of homosexuality altogether or must raise it as a negative issue.  In so doing, these programs not only 
discriminate against gay and lesbian youth based on their status; they also deny gay and lesbian youth access to 
relevant health in formation and impede their right to an education free from discrimination.  
 
Texas law directs the state department of public health to develop and make available a model curriculum 
on health education and recommends that course materials and instruction in  this curriculum “relating to sexual 
education or sexually transmitted diseases should include . . . emphasis, provided in a factual manner and from a 
public health perspective, that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and tha t 
homosexual conduct is a criminal offence under Section 21.06 of the [Texas] Penal Code.”185  Although this 
statute, by its terms, applies to the health department’s model curriculum, teachers in Texas commonly understand 
it to impose restrictions on what t hey can say more generally about homosexuality in the classroom.  Amy 
Cavender, a health educator in central Texas, citing this law, told Human Rights Watch,  
 
I don’t talk about homosexuality except in response to a direct question, because the law says th at 
you have to say negative things about it.  Then I’m careful about what I do say.  When a student 
asks me about homosexuality, I tell them that the law requires me to say that homosexuality is not 
socially acceptable, but that that’s not a reason to trea t someone badly. 186    
 
The abstinence -only programs that Human Rights Watch visited either omit discussion of homosexuality 
altogether or mention homosexuality only as a risk factor for HIV/AIDS.  Several administrators and teachers in 
these programs inter viewed by Human Rights Watch justified the absence of discussion of homosexuality by 
noting that “the program is developed to promote abstinence until marriage,” and, further, that “the community” 
would not want homosexuality addressed in the school.187  As Dr. Patricia Sulak, the director of the Scott & White 
Sex Education Program, told Human Rights Watch, “schools are limited as to what they can say about 
masturbation and homosexuality.”188  
 
Kay Coburn, whose school district uses Scott & White’s abstinence -only curriculum, explained that there 
is “no discussion of homosexuality,” nor “any message in the curriculum about how homosexuals might protect 
themselves from HIV.  Abstinence is the only message.  The traditional family is where you have sex. The 
curric ulum doesn’t address sex outside of this structure.”189  Cheryl Cox, a health teacher and council member 
recalled that when the issue of homosexuality was raised at a Robinson school health education advisory council 
meeting, the council decided that informa tion about these kinds of “lifestyle options” was “not needed or 
necessary.”190  In any event, Ms. Cox added, “I can’t see it ever being acceptable to discuss homosexuality, as it’s 
                                                                                                                                                                         
should be implemented in schools,” and that “sexual orientation should be addressed in the sexuali ty component of a 
comprehensive health instruction curriculum.”  American School Health Association (ASHA), "Gay and Lesbian Youth in

 37a very conservative community.  It’s a topic that I’m not supposed to be tal king about because of the standards set 
forth by the community and by the health advisory board.”191 
 
Terry Cruz, an abstinence educator in Laredo, told Human Rights Watch that “Probably the only time I 
touch on the subject [of homosexuality] is with HIV, re ferring to how HIV originally started.”192   Linda Grisham, 
a high school teacher who has worked on Scott & White’s abstinence -only curriculum in the Temple Independent 
School District and taught in the program, told Human Rights Watch “We [teachers at Templ e ISD] don’t talk 
about homosexuality in a love relationship.  We bring it up in certain STDs that are more common among 
homosexuals.  People in a homosexual relationship are more apt to catch AIDS because anal sex is risky.”193  
 
When asked whether homosexu ality was discussed, Clara J., a sixteen -year-old student in a McCAP 
school replied, “I think that the teacher said something about AIDS being most common among homosexuals,” 
but otherwise could not remember anything being said about gays or lesbians in cl ass.194  Charles T., a nineteen -
year-old gay student from a McCAP school recalled that the teacher’s discussion of homosexuality was limited to 
defining homosexuality and advising that if students had any “feelings like this,” they should discuss them with 
parents or a counselor.  The teacher also defined marriage as between a man and a woman.  Charles added that 
gay and lesbian students did not feel safe at school and that  even teachers made derogatory comments about 
homosexuality. 195  
 
Dr. Joe McIlhaney, pr esident of the Medical Institute for Sexual Health (Austin), told Human Rights 
Watch that his program does not address homosexuality.  “The message to kids in school is ‘don’t get involved in 
sex while an adolescent, no matter what.’”  In any event, “since  95 percent of the kids are heterosexual and since 
with the younger ones, there may be lability about sexuality, this may be a situation where it’s best to focus on the 
‘greatest good for the greatest number.’”196  The Medical Institute does, however, publis h guidelines for sexuality 
education that are distributed by McCAP, among other groups, and included in a resource guide on abstinence 
education produced under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.197  
These guideline s provide advice about answering “tough questions” about homosexuality and bisexuality through 
a “factual and balanced discussion of homosexuality and bisexuality” that should include, among other points:  
 
• “Homosexual and bisexual sex carry greater risk.  Condoms, for example, are more likely to 
fail and tear during anal intercourse than during vaginal intercourse.”198 
• “A homosexual orientation  is not the same thing as homosexual activity.   Some people who 
have a homosexual orientation decide for health, mor al or religious reasons not to practice 
homosexual sex but to refrain from all genital sexual activity.  One celibate homosexual man 
comments: ‘Your sexual behavior is still a choice.  I believe I am responsible for what I do.  
It may not always feel as if  I have a choice, but I do.’  A heterosexual person has the same 
choice.”199 
• “Homosexual sex and bisexual sex are highly controversial in our society.  Some people 
regard these activities as acceptable, while others regard them as contrary to what is right a nd 
                                                 191 Ibid.  Abstinence -only programs do, however, discuss heterosexual sex.  See, for example,  Teen Aid Inc., Sexuality, 
Commitme nt and Family: Student Text  (Spokane, Washington: Teen Aid, Inc., 1995), pp. 45 -54; Scott & White Sex 
Education Program, Teens and Sex: What are the Effects , second edition (Temple, Texas: Worth the Wait, Inc., 2001); The

The  
Medical Institute’s guidelines are advertised by Focus on the Family, the Eagle Forum and state abstinence education 
programs, among others.   198 The Medical Institute for Sexual Health (Austin), National Guidelines for Sexuality and Character Education  , p. 74.  199 Ibid.

 38normal.  In discussing this topic, schools should acknowledge and respect the fact that people 
differ in their opinions about homosexual and bisexual activities.  In many cases, however, 
the charge of ‘homophobia’ has been used inappropriately to shut o ff debate.”200 
• “Many people out of religious conscience, believe that sexual intimacy is reserved for a 
husband and wife united in marriage.  By this standard, any sex outside of heterosexual 
marriage is wrong.  It is unfair to label such people as ‘prejudic ed’ because of their beliefs.  A 
prejudice is a judgment that someone is in some way inferior because he or she is a member 
of a certain race, gender or other group.  By contrast, judgments about homosexual sex, 
bisexual sex or premarital heterosexual sex are judgments about the healthfulness or rightness 
of certain sexual behaviors, rather than about the worth of people.”201 
 
These “answers to tough questions” characterize homosexual relationships as both unhealthy and wrong 
and suggest that for those who ha ve a “homosexual orientation,” refraining from sex forever may be preferable for 
“health, moral or religious reasons.”  They also conceive of “homosexuals” as male: “homosexual and bisexual 
sex” is equated with anal sex, and lesbians are absent from this d iscussion.202 
 
Abstinence -only programs, in teaching that “safe sex” exists only in the context of marriage, assert that 
marriage itself is a source of positive social, psychological and other health benefits.  Dr. Patricia Sulak, director 
of Scott & White’s  sex education program and Dr. Joe McIlhaney, president of the Medical Institute for Sexual 
Health, both told Human Rights Watch that they promote marriage as a public health issue because people who 
engage in premarital sex are at risk of both physical an d psychological danger, while married people enjoy a range 
of benefits —including better sex lives than unmarried people.203  Marilyn Ammon, the executive director of the 
McLennan County Collaborative Abstinence Project, echoed this position.204 
 
Program curric ula, as well as materials produced and distributed by abstinence -only programs reinforce 
the position that heterosexual marriage is the only safe and appropriate context for sex.  According to a McCAP 
pamphlet describing the organization, “married people l ive longer, have higher incomes and wealth, engage less 
in risky behavior, eat more healthily and have fewer psychological problems than unmarried people .205  
“Sexuality, Commitment and Family,” one of the curricula that McCAP provides to participating schoo ls, 
includes chapters on “friendship and dating,” “marriage” and “family” that present heterosexual relationships and 
heterosexual marriage as the ideal, teach that the “nuclear family —that consisting of male -female partnership 
(marriage) plus their offspr ing” is the “basic unit of human living” and that “[I]deally, our laws and families 
should all be aimed at assisting the family to remain intact.”206   The Medical Institute’s “Building Healthy 
Futures”  instructs that “even youth unfamiliar with the concept of marriage should be introduced to the ideal and 
taught that marriage is the healthiest context in which to express their sexuality”; lists “same sex attraction” as 
behavior that increases the risk of sexual activity and therefore sexually transmitted dis eases, and teaches that 
“youth to whom marriage seems an unreachable goal”  should be counseled to delay sexual initiation as long as 
possible, with the goal of convincing them to delay until marriage.”207  The Medical Institute’s Change Makers 
seminars asks  participants to reflect on whether there is “enough emphasis on values, relationships and the 
benefits of marriage” in the educational messages to children.208   
 
Proponents of abstinence -only-until-marriage education claim that their programs treat all you th equally, 
regardless of their sexual orientation, because they give them all the same message, which is abstinence.  Dr.

 39Patricia Sulak told Human Rights Watch that schools are limited with respect to what they can say about 
homosexuality, but that her i nstruction is that “whatever the sexual behavior is, the best and healthiest choice is 
abstinence.”209  Dr. Joe McIlhaney told Human Rights Watch that he would give the same message to gay and 
lesbian individuals as he would to others: “if you’re going to ha ve sexual activity, limit it to one partner for 
life.”210   
 
Neither of the above statements is consistent with the plain language of abstinence -only legislation and 
program requirements, which require that federally funded programs teach abstinence until he terosexual marriage, 
or with the content of abstinence -only materials that the Texas abstinence -only programs distribute . They also 
ignore both the fact that federal law limits the definition of marriage within the meaning of federal abstinence -
only legis lation to exclude same -sex couples and that same -sex couples cannot yet legally marry in any state in 
the U.S.211  The Medical Institute of Sexual Health (Austin), in its National Guidelines for Sexuality and 
Character Education , advises that although homose xuals should be treated with respect, homosexuals might 
properly choose to refrain from genital sexual activity altogether for “health, moral or religious reasons.”212 
 
Human Rights Watch considers discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, includi ng the 
criminalization of private, consensual behavior between adults and the denial of civil marriage status to people on 
the basis of sexual orientation, to violate international human rights standards.213 
 
The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the bo dy charged with monitoring compliance with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has specifically noted that the existence of sodomy laws in 
the United States is a “serious infringement of private life” and has “consequences . . . . for  [the] enjoyment of 
other human rights without discrimination.”214   The U.N. Commission on Human Rights has expressed concern 
regarding the criminalization of matters of sexual orientation in any country precisely because it “increases the 
social stigmatiza tion of members of sexual minorities, which in turn makes them more vulnerable to violence and 
human rights abuses, including violations of the right to life.  Because of this stigmatization, violent acts directed 
against persons belonging to sexual minori ties are also likely to be committed in a climate of impunity.”215 
 
Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. Congress to enact federal nondiscrimination legislation that 
explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, to bring the U.S. into 
conformity with international law.  This would include repealing the Defense of Marriage Act, which limits 
marriage under federal law to a legal union between a man and a woman, and provides that no state shall be 
required to grant lega l status to same -sex marriage of another state or to any “right or claim arising from such 
relationship.”216 
                                                 209 Human Rights Watch interview with Dr. Patricia Sulak, May 1, 2002.  210 Human Rights Interview with Dr. Joe McIlhaney, May 10, 2002.  The Medical Institute’s guidelines regarding how to 
answer “tough questions” about ho mosexuality and bisexuality likewise advise that a “factual and balanced discussion of 
homosexuality and bisexuality” should mention that “[r]egardless of sexual orientation, the best way for young people to 
avoid HIV and other STDs is to follow the recomm endation made by the U.S. Department of Education’s guidebook AIDS 
and the Education of Our Children: ‘ . . . to refrain from sexual activity until as adults they are ready to establish a mutually 
faithful, monogamous relationship.’”  The Medical Institute  for Sexual Health, National Guidelines for Sexuality and

States should also repeal laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, including laws that 
discriminate against couples in same -sex un ions, laws that criminalize private consensual conduct between adults 
of the same sex, and laws and regulations that prevent teachers and service providers from including accurate and 
nondiscriminatory information to lesbian, gay and bisexual youth in prog rams of education on sex and sexually 
transmitted diseases.217 
 
 
VII.  LEGAL STANDARD S 
 
Although participation in federally funded abstinence -only programs is voluntary, they represent funding 
that is difficult and controversial for state and local governmen ts to ignore, especially in times of fiscal 
constraint.218  As Leslie Unruh, founder of the National Abstinence Clearinghouse, has noted, “abstinence has 
become a business,” which Unruh estimates has increased by more than 900 programs in recent years.219 
 
As a condition of receiving federal abstinence -only funds, abstinence -only programs must censor 
essential information about condoms as a means to prevent HIV.  This prohibition applies even when students and 
other young people in these programs directly reque st such information.   Federal abstinence -only restrictions 
distort information regarding existing effective preventive measures and decrease the likelihood that young people 
and adults will know that using condoms can prevent HIV.  
 
Federally funded abstin ence-only programs conflict with fundamental human rights.  Of particular 
concern is their interference with the right of every person to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health.  This 
requires the state to provide health -related education and info rmation to prevent epidemic diseases, and to refrain 
from censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting health -related information.  To be meaningful and 
effective, information on HIV/AIDS must be accurate and complete.  
                                                 217 Texas, for example, should  repeal Tex. Family Code § 2.001 (prohibiting marriage licenses from being issued to persons 
of the same sex) and § 3.401 (defining “spouse” as “a husband, who is a man, or a wife, who is a woman”), Tex. Penal Code 
§ 21.06 (penalizing “deviate sexual inter course with another individual of the same sex”), and Tex. Health & Safety Code § 
163.002(8) (recommending that state’s model public health education curriculum relating to sexuality or sexually transmitted 
diseases should include “emphasis, provided in a factual manner and from a public health perspective, that homosexuality is 
not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense” under state law).  218 In 2002, the federal government spent $100 million on abstine nce-only programs.  While there is no federal program that 
supports comprehensive sexuality education as such, the CDC’s school health education program (described in section VI 
above), can support school -based education programs that include discussion of  both abstinence and condom use.  In 2002, 
the CDC received $50 million for HIV prevention efforts under this program —half as much as the federal government 
allocated for abstinence -only education.  The percentage of these funds that directly supported stu dent education about 
abstinence and risk reduction through condom use is unclear, as at least some of the CDC HIV prevention funds support 
abstinence -only programs; and, further, the funds also support a wide range of  activities, such as training teachers  and school 
personnel in HIV prevention, monitoring risk behaviors among students, and program evaluation.  See discussion of CDC 
HIV/AIDS grant, above.  
The Bush Administration has argued for an  increase funding for abstinence -only programs to create “par ity” with 
programs that provide contraceptive services to teenagers through Title X of the Public Health Service Act and Medicaid.  
This argument is flawed because it compares funding for education programs with funding for public health programs that 
prov ide medical services, including contraceptive services, and also pap smears, breast exams and other health care services 
that are increasingly expensive given the rising cost of medical care.  See Cynthia Dailard, “Abstinence Promotion and Teen 
Family Plan ning: The Misguided Drive for Equal Funding,” The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy,  February 2002.  Nor 
does this comparison take into account the harm associated with abstinence -only programs.  Ibid.  219 Scott Williams, “Abstinence Becomes a Business,” Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Oct. 9, 2000.  Section 510(b) abstinence -

Because HIV/AIDS is a fat al disease that as yet has no cure, the failure of the government to provide 
HIV/AIDS information may have serious consequences for the right to life.  Unjustified limitation on the right to 
seek, receive and impart information violates the right to freedo m of expression.  And the dissemination of health 
information that excludes a certain group of people, in this case persons whose sexual orientation is not addressed 
in abstinence -only programs, infringes on the right to nondiscrimination and freedom from discrimination in 
education.  
 
International Law  
International human rights law establishes that every person, including every child, has the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health, the right to life, the right to seek, receive and impart infor mation of all kinds, 
the right to nondiscrimination and equal protection of the law, and the right to an education.  These rights stand 
alone, but in significant respects as outlined below, are intertwined and reinforce one another.  
 
These rights  are ensh rined in important international human rights treaties.  The United States is a party 
to some of these, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  The United States 
has declared a number of reservations to the ICCPR, princ ipal among these is a reservation that the provisions of 
the ICCPR are not enforceable in federal or state court without implementing legislation.220 
 
Other treaties the U.S. has signed but not ratified include the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).   While the United States is 
not specifically bound by the terms of these treaties, as a signatory it has the obligation to refrain from actions that 
would defeat the treatie s’ object and purpose.221 
 
Many of the rights contained within the major human rights treaties are derived from customary 
international law —and are applicable whether or not they are part of a country’s treaty law —or reflect prevailing 
international trends.  Thus whatever the formal legal status of these instruments within the United States, officials 
at all levels of government should respect  these rights in carrying out the responsibilities of their office.  
 
Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Heal th 
All individuals have the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health, a right guaranteed by the 
ICESCR,222 the CRC223 and the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
(CEDAW).224  The Committee on Economic, Social an d Cultural Rights, the independent panel of experts that 
monitors rights under the ICESCR and provides authoritative guidance on its provisions, has interpreted the “right 
to prevention, treatment and control of diseases” set forth in article 12 of the ICE SCR to impose a positive 
obligation on states parties to take steps necessary for the “prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, 
                                                 220 The Human Rights Committee has refused to accept reservations that effectively deprive individuals of the means to 
secure their rights.  General Comment 24(52), General Comment on Issues Relating to Reservations Made Upon Ratification 
or Accession to the Covenant or the Optional Protocols Thereto, or in Relation to Declarations Under Article 41 of the 
Covenant , U.N. Hum an Rights Committee, 52nd sess. , 1989, para. 11. The United States' declarations that the ICCPR is not 
self-executing denies individuals the means to obtain a remedy for human rights violations prohibited by these treaties if 
existing federal or state law  does not allow them to challenge these violations. Because these declarations effectively deny 
individuals access to the courts to secure the rights protected by the ICCPR, they are incompatible with the object and 
purpose of the treaty.  221 See Vienna Conv ention on the Law of Treaties, art. 18, concluded May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (entered into force 
Jan. 27, 1980).  Although the United States has not ratified the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, it regards this 
convention as “the authoritativ e guide to current treaty law and practice.”  S. Exec. Doc. L. 92nd Cong., 1st sess. (1971), p. 1.   222 ICESCR, G.A. res. 2200A (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 49, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1966), 993 U.N.T.S. 3,

behaviour -relate d health concerns such as sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, and those 
adversely affecting sexual and reproductive health.” 225 
 
According to the committee, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health 
includes the right to information and education concerning prevailing health problems, their prevention and their 
control.226  The CRC specifically requires s tates parties “[t]o ensure that all segments of society, in particular 
parents and children, are informed, ha ve access to education and are supported in the use of basic knowledge of 
child health.”227 
 
The committee, recognizing the importance of access to information, interprets the right to health to 
include the “right to seek, receive and impart information conc erning health issues.”228  In addition, the committee 
advises that states have a legal obligation to refrain from “censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting 
health -related information, including sexual education information.”229  
 
The U.N. Guidel ines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, published in 1998 by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, provide 
guidance in interpreting international legal norms as they relate to HIV  and AIDS.  The guidelines recommend 
that states “ensure that children and adolescents have adequate access to confidential sexual and reproductive 
health services, including HIV/AIDS information, counseling, testing and prevention measures such as 
condoms .”230 The guidelines also call on states to “ensure the implementation of specially designed and targeted 
HIV prevention and care programmes for those who have less access to mainstream programs,” including men 
who have sex with men, due to factors including  “physical marginalization.”231 
 
Information about HIV prevention is readily available and relatively inexpensive, depending on the means 
of dissemination.  As such, providing accurate information about the transmission of HIV and the means of 
protection aga inst infection is an essential and cost -effective part of addressing the pandemic.  
 
Right to Life  
All persons enjoy an inherent right to life, which is guaranteed in article 6 of the ICCPR.232  Noting that 
the right to life “should not be interpreted narrowl y,”233 the Human Rights Committee, which monitors 
compliance with the ICCPR, has observed:  
 
The expression “inherent right to life” cannot properly be understood in a restrictive manner and 
the protection of this right requires that States adopt positive mea sures.  In this connection, the 
Committee considers that it would be desirable for States parties to take all possible measures to 
                                                 225 General Comment  14.  The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health,  Committee on Economic, Social and

eliminate malnutrition and epidem ics.234 
 
A state’s failure to provide complete and accurate information about effective means of HIV prevention 
may have serious consequences for the right to life.  
 
Right to Information  
Everyone, including children, has the right to “seek, receive and impar t information of all kinds.”235 
Access to information also is essential to secure the right to the highest attainable standard of health.236 
 
The U.N. Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights emphasize the need for states to take affirmative 
action to provide a dequate, accessible and effective HIV -related prevention and care education, information and 
services.237  The guidelines specifically call on states to “ensure the access of children and adolescents to adequate 
health information and education, including in formation related to HIV/AIDS prevention and care, inside and 
outside school, which is tailored appropriately to age level and capacity and enables them to deal positively with 
their sexuality.”238  Similarly, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recomme nds that “access to information 
as a fundamental right of the child should become the key element in HIV/AIDS prevention strategies.”239 
 
Right to Nondiscrimination and Equal Protection, Right to Education, Right to Privacy  
All persons have the right to equa lity before the law and equal protection of the laws.  The guarantees of 
equality before the law and equal protection of the laws prevent a government from arbitrarily making distinctions 
among classes of persons in promulgating and enforcing its laws.  
 
Under article 26 of the ICCPR, “the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons 
equal and effective protection against discrimination on any  ground such as  race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”240  The Human Rights 
Committee interprets article 26 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.241 
 
The U.N. Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights advise that states enact antidiscrimination and 
protective laws to “reduce human rights violations against children in the context of HIV/AIDS” and to “provide 
for children’s access to HIV -related information, education and means of prevention inside and outside school.”242  
The guidelines also recommend t hat “[a]nti -discrimination and protective laws should be enacted to reduce human 
                                                 234 Ibid., para. 5.  235 See ICCPR, art. 19, CR C, art. 13.  236 See General Comment 14, The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health.  Committee on Economic, Social and

charged with monitoring compliance with the ICCPR, determined in a 1994 case t hat an Australian law banning sexual 
contact between consenting adult men was a violation of Australia’s obligations as a party to the ICCPR.  This decision 
concluded that the discrimination provision of the ICCPR should be understood to prohibit discrimin ation on the basis of 
sexual orientation.  See Toonen vs. Australia, U.N. Human Rights Committee, CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992, April 4, 1994.  241 See Views of the Human Rights Committee under article 5, paragraph 4, of the Optional Protocol to the International

relationships, giving legal recognition to same -sex marriages and/or relationships . . .”243 
   
International  law guarantees the right to an education and to freedom from discrimination in education.244  
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated: “The prohibition against discrimination 
enshrined in article 2(2) of the [ICESCR] is subject to n either progressive realization nor the availability of 
resources; it applies fully and immediately to all aspects of education and encompasses internationally prohibited 
grounds of discrimination.”245   
  
National Law  
The First Amendment to the United States  Constitution provides strong protection for freedom of 
expression, stating that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.”246  This Constitutional 
guarantee of free speech extends to children and protects the right to receive inform ation as well as to speak 
out.247   The government may generally impose content -based restrictions on speech —even those imposed in the 
name of protecting youth —only where it can establish a compelling interest in regulating speech and that its 
regulations ar e narrowly tailored to serve this interest.248 While the government may impose more stringent 
controls on speech with respect to youth than adults, children are nonetheless entitled to a “significant measure of 
First Amendment Protection, and only in relativ ely narrow and well -defined circumstances may government bar 
public dissemination of protected materials to them.”249   
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that states and local school boards have broad discretion to 
manage their affairs and to “establish  and apply their curriculum in such a way as to transmit community 
values.”250  While “the discretion of the States and local school boards in matters of education must be exercised 
                                                 243 Ibid, para. 30(h).  244 Convention on the Rights of the Child, articles 2(1), 2(2), 28(1); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, articles 2(2), 13.      245 General Comment 13.  The Right to Education,  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, para. 13.  
International human rights bodies have held that laws criminalizing consensual sex between adults of the same sex, such as 
the law that is incorporated into Texas’ model health curriculum, violate article 17 of the ICCPR, which guarantees the right 
to privacy.  See, for example, Views of the Human Rights Committee under article 5, paragraph 4 of the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning Communication No. 488/1992: Australia , para . 9, 
Human Rights Committee, 50th Sess., U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (April 4, 1994).  246 U.S. Constitution, amend. 1.  The First Amendment applies to both federal and state action.  See Gitlow v. New York, 268 
U.S. 652, 666 (1925).  247 See Board of Educati on v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853, 866 -72 (1982) (plurality opinion) (local school board cannot remove books 
from school library for political or partisan reasons without violating students’ constitutional right to receive information); 
Tinker v. Des Moines School District , 393 U.S. 503, 511 (1969) (constitutional right to freedom of expression extends to 
minors).  248 Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Educators’ Ass’n , 460 U.S. 37 (1983). A bstinence -only programs may narrowly fall within 
Supreme Court jurisprudence permittin g viewpoint discrimination in  certain government -funded programs.  See, for 
example, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991); but see  Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 
U.S. 819 (1995) and Legal Services v. Velazquez , 531  U.S. 533 (2001).  These programs nonetheless  suppress speech in a 
manner that is deeply at odds with basic First Amendment norms protecting the free flow of honest and accurate information, 
see Board of Education v. Pico 457 U.S. 853 (1982) and the public  freedom of mind, see generally Stanley v. Georgia, 394 
U.S. 557 (1969).  249 Erznoznick v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212 -14 &  n. 11 (1975) (invalidating ordinance prohibiting nudity in

also noting that age is a relevant factor in determining child’s capacity for individual choice that presupposes First 
Amendment guarantees); see also Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp.,  463 U.S. 60, 74 -75 & n. 30 (noting that statute 
that prohibited unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements “clearly denies information to minors, who are entitled to 
a ‘significant measure of First Amendment Protection’”).  250 Board of Education v. P ico, 457 U.S. 853, 864 (1982).

 45in a manner that comports with the transcendent imperatives of the First Ame ndment,”251 public schools may, in 
some cases, impose “reasonable restrictions” on student expression and censor speech  that the government could 
not censor outside the school setting.252  A federal district court has held that minors have a substantial inter est in 
receiving accurate information about HIV/AIDS prevention, and therefore a state agency could not justify its 
decision to  refuse to post advertisements that promoted the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS 
by claiming that it needed to shield children from this information.253   
 
The U.S. Constitution guarantees all persons equal protection of the laws.254  As the Supreme Court has 
recognized, the right to equal protection “must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation clas sifies 
for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or  persons.”255  Courts examine closely 
laws that discriminate based on race, national origin, religion, sex and illegitimacy, and require the state to 
establish a compelling j ustification for laws that impose burdens on fundamental rights (such as the right to 
vote).256  Where states discriminate based on other classifications, including based on sexual orientation, they 
must meet the lesser standard of showing only that there is  at least a rational basis for the discrimination.257   
 
Although the Supreme Court has held that some intimate personal choices deserve protection under the 
Constitutional right to privacy as “fundamental rights,” it has not accorded such protection to same -sex 
relationships or same -sex marriage.258  But e ven when the state distinguishes among people in ways that do not

student could not, under the First Amendment, be compelled to salute the flag  and noting that boards of ed ucation must 
exercise their discretion within the limits of the Bill of Rights.  “That they are educating the young for citizenship is reason 
for scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the free mind at  its source and 
teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.”); Tinker v. Des Moines School District,  
393 U.S. 503 (1969); see also Edward v Aguillar , 482 U.S. 578 (1987) (invalidating statute that prevented schools fr om

symbolic and financial support, it violated First Amendment Establishment Clause).   252 Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S.  260, 266 -67 (1988).  Schools may also  regulate student speech in school -
sponsored activities more broadly than other student speech in schools.  Compare Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 
478 U.S. 675, 685 (1986) (school need not tolerate vulgar s peech at school sponsored function inconsistent with its “basic 
educational mission”) and Hazelwood School Dist. 484 U.S.  at 273 (school may censor articles in school -sponsored 
newspaper if action is “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns” ) with Tinker,  393 U.S. at 509 (student 
expression may be curtailed or censored only where it would “materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of 
appropriate discipline in the operation of the school”).  253 AIDS Action Committee of Massac husetts, Inc. v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, 849 F. Supp. 79 (D. Mass. 
1993), aff’d, 42 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994) (minors’ interest in receiving information about use of condoms to prevent HIV 
outweighed state’s interest in insulating them fro m this information by restricting display of advertisements about condoms); 
cf. Bolger,  463 U.S. at 74 & n. 30 (observing that “it cannot go without notice that adolescent children apparently have a 
pressing need for information about contraception” as da ta indicate that a significant number of teenagers are sexually active 
and become pregnant unintentionally).  254 U.S. states are bound by the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that “[n]o state shall .  
. . deny to any person  within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Constitution, amend. XIV, § 1.  The 
federal courts have interpreted the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment to require the federal government to observe 
substantially similar norms of equal treatment. See, for example, Bolling v. Sharpe,  347 U.S. 497 (1954) (invalidating racial 
segregation in District of Columbia public schools under the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment). The Due Process 
clause provides that "[n]o person shall be . . .  deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." U.S.

IX.  CONCLUSION  
 
On their website, the Centers for Disease Control maintain a fact sheet on HIV/AIDS among American 
youth.  Their logo reminds the reader that “HIV Prevention Saves Lives;” the fact sheet itself stresses the 
importance of providing comprehensive information to young people about how to protect themselves from HIV 
infection, including information about condom use.  The CDC’s advice is consistent with that of the Institute of 
Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, ot her federal government institutions that set U.S. public health 
standards.  
  
Since 1997, the U.S. Congress has allocated more than $350 million —$100 million in fiscal year 2002 
alone —to support abstinence -only-until-marriage programs that cannot, by law, f ollow this advice.  Indeed, the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers federal abstinence -only programs, cannot 
grant these funds to abstinence -only programs that would pursue DHHS’ own stated objective to “increase the 
proportion of adolescents who . . . use condoms if sexually active.”  
  
Federally funded abstinence -only programs, in keeping with their federal mandate, deny children basic 
information that could protect them from HIV/AIDS infection and discriminate against gay and l esbian children.  
In so doing, these programs not only interfere with fundamental rights to information, to health and to equal 
protection under the law.  They also place children at unnecessary risk of HIV infection and premature death. In 
the case of HIV /AIDS, what they don’t know may kill them.

against racial intermarriage); Skinner v. Oklahoma,  316 U.S. 535 (1942) (invalidating state law providing for sterilization of 
certain repeat felons); Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur,  414 U.S. 632 (1974 ); Griswold v. Connecticut,  381 U.S. 479 
(1965) (invalidating state statute criminalizing use of contraceptives); Roe v. Wade,  410 U.S. 113 (1973) (holding that only a 
compelling state interest can justify state regulation of a decision to end a pregnancy) . 259 See Romer v. Evans,  517 U.S. 620 (1996) (holding that amendment to Colorado constitution prohibiting all legislative, 
judicial or executive action protecting against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violated the U.S. 
Constitutional gua rantees of equal protection).
