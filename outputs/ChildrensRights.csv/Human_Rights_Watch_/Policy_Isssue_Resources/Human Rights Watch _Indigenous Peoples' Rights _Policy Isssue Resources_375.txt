Atkinson, Bureau of Indian Affairs to Human Rights Watch,September 30, 2013ResourcesSummaryNestled along the bank ofthe Missouri River incentral South Dakota, the Lower Brule SiouxReservation of around 389 square miles is home to about 1,600 people of the 3,400 member Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.Most reservations in the United States are small and home to fewer than 10,000people and Lower Brule is among the smallest. More than 40 percent of the populationon the reservation lives in poverty. Many tribal members lack access toemployment opportunities or an acceptable quality of basic services. As is trueof many other reservations, Lower Brule’s chronic poverty and the remotenature of its landholdings largely reflect the cumulative impact of myriadhistorical injustices the tribe has suffered at the hands of the United Statesgovernment. But in the case of Lower Brule, tribal members’ struggles arecompounded by a Tribal Government that is characterized by rampant financialmismanagement and is largely unaccountable to the people it governs.This report describes patterns of debilitating financialmismanagement by the Lower Brule Tribal Government and how these problems areentrenched by its ability to avoid any kind of public accountability. Fundsdesperately needed to address profound social needs and advance the basicrights of tribal members are instead channeled into highly questionableprojects or diverted away from essential services like education or waterwithout explanation. A small circle of political elites with stark conflicts ofinterest between their public responsibilities and personal interests runs theTribal Government in an environment largely devoid of transparency. TribalGovernment institutions are unresponsive to public concerns about theseproblems and largely resist meaningful accountability. Meanwhile, externalactors with the capacity to mobilize pressure to address some of theseproblems, including the federal government, have done little to encouragechange.The tribe’s opaque six member Tribal Council wieldsvirtually complete control over the political and economic life of thereservation. While the Tribal Council is democratically elected, the chairmanof the Tribal Council, Michael Jandreau, and his ruling majority have heldpower for more than 30 years. This report shows how Tribal Council members havesystematically withheld information from the public in order to avoidaccountability. That led to a situation in which harmful patterns ofmismanagement were able to thrive in secrecy. Funds for key social serviceswere inexplicably diverted at the expense of the human rights of tribal members,while tribal members lacked effective mechanisms to hold members of the TribalCouncil accountable for their actions.The lack of transparency and accountability has created serioushuman rights problems at Lower Brule. This report suggests key reforms tobetter protect tribal members’ human rights and improve accountability.Lower Brule’s Tribal Government is now at an importantcrossroads. Changes in the composition of the Tribal Council after theSeptember 2014 elections may have created an opportunity to break with the pastand introduce badly needed reforms. Three new council members have been electedto the six member council and have the opportunity to examine thegovernment’s past activities and implement new reforms to safeguardtransparency and ensure accountability. It remains an open question whether thecouncil will fulfill these responsibilities and make itself accountable to thetribe.Although the Lower Brule Tribal Government rebuffedvirtually all of our requests for information, Human Rights Watch was able toassemble a fairly detailed picture of mismanagement, human rights abuses, andimpunity through dozens of interviews and hundreds of pages of documents,including federal and Tribal Government documents and financial reports.Human Rights Watch research found that at least US$25million of Tribal Government expenditures from 2007 to 2014 remain unexplained.Almost that entire amount had been earmarked for programs meant to provideessential services, alleviate poverty, or promote much needed economicdevelopment. That is an average of an almost 11 percent loss annually from theTribal Government’s budget for those years.This report also documents the events surrounding the tribe’sdisastrous 2009 purchase of Westrock, a now-defunct Wall Street firm. TheWestrock affair serves as a clear illustration of the broader patterns ofmismanagement and impunity that plague the government.Chairman Jandreau and others involved in the deal justifiedWestrock’s purchase as an investment that would help alleviate poverty onthe reservation, but the firm subsequently collapsed due to mismanagement andfraud. This potentially cost United States taxpayers over $20 million becauseof a federal loan guarantee for the deal, and also diverted undisclosed amountsof scarce tribal resources into what was essentially a black hole. The councilabused its authority by withholding information about the deal. Thisinformation should have been made public according to the Tribal Constitutionand Bylaws.The Westrock affair is emblematic of the broader crisis ofgovernance that the Lower Brule Tribal Council precipitated by exploiting alack of federal oversight and the absence of any way for tribal members to holdtheir government accountable.The Tribal Government has undermined the rights of tribalmembers, including the right to information, enshrined in international law aswell as in the tribe’s own constitution. Additionally, the economic andsocial rights of people on the reservation have been undermined becausemillions of dollars meant to pay for essential services such as education,water, or key poverty alleviation programs have been diverted by the governmentwithout explanation.Tribal members lack an effective remedy for theseviolations. Because of the legal contours of tribal sovereignty in the UnitedStates, tribal members can only challenge their government in federal courtsunder very limited circumstances. At the same time, no effective remedies areavailable through the Lower Brule Tribal Government, which ignores its dutiesof open government under the Tribal Constitution. Although the right to aneffective remedy is protected under the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights, to which the US is a party, the federal government haslimited jurisdiction over tribal internal affairs, and cannot compel a tribe toinstitute remedies through tribal courts or other institutions. LowerBrule’s members have no real way to compel the tribal government to liveup to these responsibilities because there are few rules governing theseactivities and the ones in place are ignored.Economic and Social RightsUnder international human rights law, governments areobliged to invest in essential social services commensurate to their availableresources. Human rights norms do not prescribe exactly how much governments shouldinvest in these areas relative to other competing public priorities. However,when large sums intended to provide basic services are simply lost throughmismanagement or corruption rather than allocated to some other legitimategovernment purpose, it leaves governments in breach of their human rightsobligations.The Tribal Council has regularly diverted funds intended toprovide essential services such as water and education, assistance to the poor,and economic development that would alleviate poverty and provide the sourcesof revenue to help pay for social services. As such, millions of dollars indesperately needed resources on a very poor reservation have been lost, oftenwithout any explanation.Factors Impeding US FederalInvestigationThe federal government has jurisdiction to investigate andprosecute those credibly implicated in the misuse of federal funds andprosecute other federal crimes on reservations, including crimes involvingtribal government officials. But it does not have jurisdiction over mattersconsidered to be under the exclusive purview of sovereign tribal governments,such as the questionable allocation of tribal land, unexplained payments, orother uses of tribal resources. While Human Rights Watch recognizes theimportance of tribal sovereignty, sovereignty entails human rightsresponsibilities. The way the Lower Brule Tribal Council has exercised itssovereignty has left tribal members with little way to secure a remedy againstofficial misconduct, secrecy, or abuse.Even where the federal government has jurisdiction, resourceconstraints impede the federal government’s ability to investigatewrongdoing. Due to limited resources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)tends to prioritize a heavy caseload of crimes involving drugs, violence, orsexual offenses over corruption-related criminal investigations. While theDepartment of Interior’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) typicallytakes the lead on investigating corruption or other wrongdoing because so muchof tribal governments’ funding comes from the Bureau of Indian Affairs,both the FBI and OIG are under-resourced. There are only about 85 OIGinvestigators nationally and just a handful of investigators for the regionthat includes Lower Brule and at least 13 other reservations in South Dakota,North Dakota, and parts of Montana.Despite these barriers, the demonstration of political willon the part of tribal governments and the federal government to address theseissues could improve human rights and increase accountability, while preservingtribal self-government and control.Tribal sovereignty means that the principal obligation toprotect the rights of tribal members rests with tribal governments. It alsorequires that tribal governments ensure adequate mechanisms exist to protectthose rights. For example, Lower Brule’s Tribal Council could abide byand strengthen the access to information provisions in the Tribal Constitutionand Bylaws by creating an ombudsman or some other mechanism that couldindependently and effectively investigate allegations of Tribal Governmentmisconduct or provide a mechanism to examine allegations of human rights abuse.The federal government should publish documentation related to its funding,such as audits, and should devote more resources to the FBI and Bureau ofInterior’s Office of Inspector General so they can investigate crimesthat fall under their jurisdiction.Such reforms are urgently needed at Lower Brule and wouldset an important precedent. Until reforms are made, the opaque andunaccountable activities of the Tribal Council will continue to restrict theability of tribal members to enjoy their human rights.RecommendationsTothe Lower Brule Sioux Tribal CouncilPublish all past and current Tribal Councilresolutions, minutes of meetings, and related documentation, as required by theTribal Constitution.Establish an independent body as part of theTribal Government, such as an ombudsman or inspector general, to investigateallegations of government waste, fraud, or abuse, such as nepotism, otherconflicts of interest, or mismanagement of public funds. This entity shouldhave the authority to investigate allegations of wrongdoing in TribalGovernment, including by Tribal Council members. Such actions may include butare not limited to taking testimony, compelling relevant documents, andcompiling other evidence.Publish the names of board members, minutesof meetings, financial records, and other information about the deliberationsand activities of businesses owned by the Tribal Government.Investigate the diversions of funds from health,water, and other programs as detailed in Tribal Government audits and publishthose findings.Investigate the Westrock deal to determinethe circumstances behind that venture and account for all federal and tribalfunds spent in relation to this deal.To the United States FederalGovernmentInvestigate allegations of waste, fraud, orabuse involving federal funds used by the Lower Brule Tribal Government,including the Bureau of Indian Affairs loan guarantee used for the Westrockdeal.Ensure that investigators have adequateresources to investigate allegations of waste, fraud, or abuse.Make the full A-133 or federal single auditspublic with regard to Lower Brule’s Tribal Government.Consider delaying funding if the Lower BruleSioux Tribal Council refuses to abide by its constitutional provisionsregarding open and transparent government.Press the Lower Brule Sioux Tribal Councilto publicly disclose the use of federal funds that were diverted from socialprograms.Publicly disclose what steps the USgovernment took to identify what happened to the diverted federal funds andwhat steps federal agencies took to address those diversions, includingrequiring reimbursements by the Tribal Government, investigations, or othermeasures.To Tribal GovernmentsConvene an inter-tribal discussion todevelop and implement best practices for transparency and human rightsaccountability within tribal governments.MethodologyThis report describes patterns of debilitating financialmismanagement by the Lower Brule Tribal Government and its ability to avoid anykind of public accountability. Funds desperately needed to address profoundsocial needs and advance the basic rights of tribal members have instead beenchanneled into highly questionable projects or diverted away from essentialservices like education or water without explanation. The report shows how formany years Tribal Council members have systematically withheld information fromthe public in order to avoid accountability.Lower Brule is a very small community under the samegovernment leadership since 1980. This leadership has been extremely resistantto openness or other reforms. As such, the situation on this reservationpresents a clear example of what Human Rights Watch has documented in manyother parts of the world: the lack of governmental transparency andaccountability can severely undermine the rights of the governed. Investigatingthis required individual interviews with persons involved and documentaryevidence to show monetary flows, relationships, and legal responsibilities.One of the reasons Human Rights Watch examined the conductof Lower Brule’s Tribal Government, and in particular its Tribal Council,is because of its failure to put into place meaningful mechanisms to holdofficials accountable. That is in contrast to other tribal governments, such asthe Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians that have numerous rulesand regulations to ensure financial transparency and accountability. LowerBrule’s government has ignored its constitutional provisions requiringtransparency. In that respect, the situation at Lower Brule is a stark examplehow protecting the rights of the governed is contingent on transparency andaccountability within government.Research for this report was conducted from December 2012 toSeptember 2014, and included travel to the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation inSouth Dakota, other parts of South Dakota, New Mexico, New York, andWashington, DC.Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 50 tribal members,including former Tribal Council members and former government employees whohave direct knowledge of the activities detailed in this report. Human RightsWatch notified all interviewees about the purpose and intent of our research,and all interviewees but three agreed to be identified. Those three people arereferred to in this report by pseudonyms. Most interviews were conductedindividually in person or by telephone. No compensation or other benefits wereprovided to interviewees.Dating back to the 1990s, four former Tribal Council membershave made complaints to various federal agencies, including the USAttorney’s Office in South Dakota, the US Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, the US Department of Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, andmembers of Congress, without any follow up investigations. Human Rights Watchinterviewed the four former council members about the complaints they had submittedto federal authorities. One of those individuals, Sonny Ziegler, wassubsequently re-elected to the Tribal Council in September 2014.Human Rights Watch also reviewed letters and othersubmissions to federal authorities alleging wrongdoing by the Tribal Counciland interviewed three tribal members who recounted how they met with federalauthorities and submitted complaints.Human Rights Watch obtained hundreds of pages of Tribal Governmentdocuments, including federal audits of its activities. Human Rights Watch also obtainedthe official criminal records of Paul Pomfret and Mark Casolo, who wererespectively convicted by federal and state cases. Those two individuals wereinvolved in some of the transactions involving Westrock, and their criminalcases relate to these activities. These records provided valuable insights intoTribal Government activities.The tribe and its businesses have been subject to severallawsuits in state and federal courts related to the 2009 acquisition of Westrock,a now-defunct Wall Street firm. The Tribal Government has aggressively tried toseal much of the evidence in one key lawsuit related to the Westrockacquisition. Nonetheless, Human Rights Watch obtained some documents from theWestrock cases, including evidence the Tribal Government submitted about its businesses,sworn affidavits by the principals involved, and court rulings citing suchevidence. We also interviewed Dr. Gavin Clarkson, president of one of the tribe’sbusinesses and the person who negotiated a key part of the Westrock deal on itsbehalf. Human Rights Watch also obtained key documents from two federalbankruptcy proceedings relevant to the Westrock deal.Human Rights Watch repeatedly sought to meet with the TribalCouncil, including in April 2013, when the author of this report was in LowerBrule. At that time, council members were unavailable to meet. The TribalGovernment’s head administrator, Lee Brennan, asked us to contact theTribal Council in writing.Human Rights Watch subsequently did so on four occasions torequest further information about government activities, solicit its responseto Human Rights Watch’s findings, incorporate its perspective on issuescovered in this report, and to meet in person. In response to these requests, TaraAdamski, the Tribal Government’s general counsel, had two brief telephoneconversations with Human Rights Watch in May and June 2013. In thoseconversations, she initially said that the Tribal Council would provide theinformation Human Rights Watch requested, but has since refused to provide anyinformation to Human Rights Watch.In September 2014, Human Rights Watch sent detailed lettersto each Tribal Council member requesting comments on each of the specificissues detailed in this report. We also notified Ms. Adamski of our requestsand repeatedly contacted the Tribal Government for a response to our letters tothe council. At this writing, no one from the Tribal Council or any otherrepresentative of the government had responded to any requests for informationor for comment.Human Rights Watch repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried tocontact federal government officials to discuss allegations of wrongdoing,including officials at the Department of Interior and the Bureau of IndianAffairs (BIA). The BIA is the principal liaison between the US government andtribal governments and was the federal agency responsible for the program thatawarded the $22.5 million loan guarantee to the tribal government-owned LowerBrule Community Development Enterprise (LBCDE) for the purchase of Westrock.At time of writing the BIA had not responded to repeatedrequests to meet Human Rights Watch. On September 30, 2013, the BIA said itwould not provide information in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)request related to the Westrock deal because this case was now subject to aninvestigation by the Office of Inspector General. On November 24, 2014, the BIAtold Human Rights Watch that it was trying to provide Lower Brule’sfederal audits in response to a separate FOIA request, but the TribalGovernment was attempting to have information pertaining to the requestwithheld.Between February and September 2013, Human Rights Watch filedone dozen FOIA requests with different government agencies including theDepartment of the Treasury, the BIA, the Substance Abuse and Mental HealthAdministration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order toobtain key documents about the tribe’s use of federal funds. At thiswriting, only some agencies had provided information. In one instance, theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development gave information despite TribalGovernment efforts to prevent disclosures. At time of writing the US Departmentof Treasury had not responded to requests for audits or information aboutTribal Government programs.At least three people in three different vehicles followedor monitored Human Rights Watch activities during various trips to thereservation. Human Rights Watch was told by tribal members present when thatsurveillance occurred that it was likely undertaken by the Tribal Government ortheir associates. Such surveillance illustrates the Tribal Government’ssuspicion about outside inquiries into their conduct. For these reasons, HumanRights Watch interviewed people individually and in private to minimize thepossibility of retaliation or other adverse consequences if they criticized thegovernment.The documentary information for this report has been postedon the Human Rights Watch website for reference.I. The Lower Brule Sioux TribeThe Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, or Kul Wicasa Oyate (Lower… Men … Nation) is a part of the Sicangu Oyate or the“Burned Thigh” band of the Lakota Sioux, part of the Great SiouxNation.[1] A largerbranch lives at the Rosebud Reservation, South Dakota.[2]Like Native Americans throughout the United States, theLower Brule Sioux have borne the brunt of centuries of hardship, repeatedconflicts with the US government, and brutal and misguided US policies,including policies of forced assimilation that began in the early 18th centurywhen European explorers and traders first came into contact with the LowerBrule tribe along the Upper Missouri River.[3]Tensions between the US government and the Sioux continuedthrough much of the 19th century. The first documented case of open conflictbetween the US government and the Lower Brule tribe occurred in 1854.[4]In 1866, the Lower Brule Sioux led by Chief Iron Nation negotiated a peacetreaty with the government that relegated them to the first Lower Brulereservation.[5] In 1868,the Fort Laramie treaty established a Great Sioux Reservation with a specificLower Brule Reservation at the mouth of the White River and the federalgovernment’s Lower Brule Agency.[6]New conflicts in the 1870s between the Sioux and the US,largely over gold in the Black Hills, led to President Ulysses S. Grant’sorder that all Native Americans move to their respective reservations by 1876under threat of force.[7] NativeAmericans who resisted were soon overwhelmed, and the US took control of theBlack Hills in 1877. Disagreement over the ownership of the Black Hills isstill a contentious issue between tribal governments and the US.[8]The last two decades of the 19th century spawned brutalfederal policies towards Native Americans. The Dawes Act of 1887 establisheddisastrous land seizures and forced assimilation that effectively gave the USgovernment complete control over Native American lives, culture, and livelihoodsby removing traditional land and placing it in trust held by the US.[9]In 1891 the Lower Brule Reservation and the tribe were movedto an area close to Chamberlain, South Dakota. In the following decades, residentsfell further into poverty. In the 1920s many resorted to selling their land tomeet basic needs.[10]In the 1930s, US policy towards Native Americans began toreject assimilation, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 authorizedlimited tribal government. In 1935, Lower Brule was one of the first tribes tohave their constitution and government recognized.[11]But in the 1940s, members of Congress proposed the“termination policy,” under which the US government would eliminatereservations, withdraw recognition of specific tribes, and assimilate NativeAmericans into the dominant culture.[12] MostNative Americans strongly opposed the policy. Convinced the tribe would bebetter able to advance its interests if it were terminated, Lower Brule’sleadership was the only tribe to volunteer for termination. Its request wasnever granted for reasons that are still unclear.[13]Termination was tragic for Native Americans. By the time itwas ended under the Johnson and Nixon administrations, 109 tribes had alreadybeen terminated, almost 1.4 million acres of land held in trust for the tribeshad been relinquished (much of it sold to non-Indians), over 13,000 people hadlost official recognition as members of a tribe, and poverty had deepened.Presidents Johnson and Nixon ultimately opposed termination, in part due to strongpressure from Native Americans.[14]A new series of laws and policies followed that promotedgreater tribal sovereignty. The Indian Civil Rights Act of April 1968 enshrinedcertain rights to individual tribal members derived from the US Bill of Rights,and in 1970, President Richard Nixon articulated further policy changes thatrepudiated termination.[15]These changes coincided with increased activism on behalf ofNative American rights and serious confrontations with the federal government,including the 71-day siege in 1975 by the American Indian Movement (AIM) at thePine Ridge reservation.In 1975, the US government passed the IndianSelf-Determination and Education Assistance Act intended to partly negate terminationpolicies, strengthen tribal government sovereignty, and recognize that priorfederal government programs had “denied to the Indian people an effectivevoice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indianswhich are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities.”[16]The new laws, policies, and court decisions have definedmodern tribal sovereignty in the US and relations between the federalgovernment and tribal governments.II. Tribal Government’s Human RightsResponsibilitiesWhen a particular government exercises control over asociety’s economic resources without meaningful oversight, there is asignificant risk of mismanagement or self-dealing. The absence of meaningfulgovernment transparency and accountability compounds this risk.The Lower Brule Tribal Council controls political life onthe reservation and virtually all of the tribe’s economic resources. Itoperates in secret and has withheld key information from tribal members andother key constituencies. Millions of dollars in scarce public funds have beendiverted from programs intended to help the poor, provide essential services,or promote development to alleviate poverty. The reasons for the diversion haveeither not been explained, or have been explained in ways that raise seriousquestions about mismanagement and possible corruption.Right to InformationAccess to information is enshrined as a right under article19(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) towhich the US is a party. That article states, “[e]very one shall have theright to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek,receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any othermedia of his choice.”[17]The UN Committee on Human Rights, the interpretive body forthis treaty, has said that the right of information requires states parties to“make every effort to ensure easy, prompt, effective, and practicalaccess to such information,” including by ensuring that any fees for suchrequests do not constitute an “unreasonable impediment” to suchinformation.[18]Although neither the text of article 19(2) nor the HumanRights Committee explicitly state that access to information includes access togovernment budgets or financial information, this is typically the type ofinformation to which the public needs access in a democratic society toevaluate government performance and hold their governments accountable.That perspective is supported by experts, such as several UNspecial rapporteurs on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom ofopinion and expression who have repeatedly emphasized the importance ofgovernments and other “public bodies” in making information publicbecause it allows the governed to “challenge or influence publicpolicies; monitor the quality of public spending; and promoteaccountability.”[19] Forexample, the former UN Special Rapporteur on Free Expression Frank LaRuerepeatedly emphasized the importance of access to information for the poor inorder to allow them to make informed decisions about poverty alleviation and toenable them to hold their governments accountable.[20]In the United States, the protection of the right toinformation is assisted by principles of open government that mean federal,state, and local government proceedings are usually open and records of theirdeliberations and decisions are public. Public records, such as budgets orother financial information, are relatively easy to obtain. For example, the USCongress, state legislatures, and city councils typically meet openly and theirdecisions are made public. Many tribal governments are also open and providesome basic information about their activities.[21]Additionally, the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)provides a right to information about federal government activities.[22]This act affords US citizens, including Native Americans, access to someinformation about the federal government and the use of public funds. The actalso can indirectly provide information to people about tribal governmentsbecause federal funds flow to tribes. States have their own freedom ofinformation laws, but they are far less relevant to gaining information abouttribal governments as states have far fewer areas where jurisdiction or fundingintersects with tribal governments.Freedom of information laws are important for transparency,but obtaining documents through freedom of information requests is often aslow, uneven, and costly process. For example, a number of tribal members atLower Brule filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for documents thathad financial information about the tribe, but were told that since they didnot meet qualifications for fee waivers, they had to pay almost $1,800 in orderto access the documents they had requested. In this case, FOIA fees presented asignificant barrier to access to information because $1,800 is roughly equal to13-18 percent of the average per capita income at Lower Brule.[23]While the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is very useful, it cannotcompensate for or replace tribal government transparency.Moreover, tribal governments are not obliged to adoptfreedom of information laws and may not have legal mechanisms to enforce thedisclosure of information. At Lower Brule, tribal constitutional provisions foraccess to information cannot be enforced without the acquiescence of the TribalCouncil.[24]Economic, Social, and Cultural RightsThe failure to invest in the provision of key governmentfunctions and public services such as health, education, and waterproportionate to a government’s available resources is a failure ofgovernmental obligation to progressively realize core economic, social, andcultural rights.[25]Economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to an adequatestandard of living, the right to housing, the right to health, and many othersimilar fundamental guarantees, are integral to the international system ofhuman rights. For instance, they are contained in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights (UDHR),[26] aninstrument to which all states belonging to the United Nations are deemed tosubscribe. The UDHR is increasingly recognized as having the force of customaryinternational law.Although the US signed the International Covenant onEconomic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the leading internationaltreaty protecting such rights,[27] it hasnot ratified it.[28]Nevertheless, it is bound by customary international law not to take actionsthat would undermine the object and purpose of the treaty.[29]The discussion by the UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights onthe scope of such rights provides an authoritative guidance on measuresgovernments should be taking to ensure rights in this sphere.Human Rights Watch research over the years in many countrieshas demonstrated that the diversion of public resources through corruption andmismanagement will generally violate a government’s obligation to“progressively realize” economic, social, and cultural rightsbecause it reduces the available resources a government has to invest in essentialservices.[30]International Human Rights, Lack of Enforcement for TribalGovernments, and the Right to an Effective RemedyThe United Nations Declaration on the Rights of IndigenousPeoples also provides specific guidance on how human rights protections applyto people such as Native Americans. Although the US voted against the declarationin 2007, it subsequently endorsed it in 2010. This declaration makes clear thatIndigenous Peoples collectively have the right to “maintain and developtheir political, economic, and social systems or institutions.”[31]However, the declaration also states that the rights enumeratedin the declaration must respect the “human rights and fundamentalfreedoms of all” and that the “exercise of the rights set forth inthis declaration shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined bylaw and in accordance with international human rights obligations.”[32]Although the declaration does not explicitly define thehuman rights obligations of indigenous governments, it does recognize and reaffirmthat “indigenous individuals are entitled without discrimination to allhuman rights recognized in international law.” It is increasinglyrecognized that self-determination entails human rights obligations and thegoverning institutions of Indigenous Peoples are obliged to respect the humanrights of the people they govern.[33]In the United States, the human rights obligations of tribalgovernments are hard to enforce due to the complicated nature of tribalsovereignty.US law does not incorporate international human rightsstandards in a manner that is binding upon tribal governments. Additionally, somefederal protections do not apply in areas solely under the jurisdiction oftribal governments.[34]This has led to a situation where it is very difficult tohold tribal governments accountable when they violate their members’rights if they have not themselves provided a mechanism for redress, even inmatters where other citizens of the United States would have a remedy underfederal or state jurisdiction. Noted Native American jurists and legalscholars, such as Michigan State University law professor Wenona Singel, havedetailed this loophole in human rights protections:Indian tribes are largely immune from externalaccountability with respect to human rights. In fact, tribes have effectivelyslipped into a gap in the global system of human rights responsibility.…This gap in the human rights system exists because tribes do not have directobligations under public international law, they are largely immune fromexternal accountability under the domestic law of the United States, and theyare frequently immune from judicial review within their own systems of triballaw. Furthermore, there is no system apart from the limited federal courtreview process that allows for external accountability.… The failure of the legal system to provide for tribal accountability forhuman rights produces serious harms for Indian tribes and their politics.[35]Article 2(3) of the ICCPR, to which the US isa party, sets out that each state party should undertake to “ensure thatany person whose rights or freedoms … are violatedshall have an effective remedy” that will be determined before acompetent authority and be enforced. The ICCPR explicitly provides that remedyneeds to exist when the violation is committed by a person acting in anofficial capacity.[36]In its General Comment 31, the Human RightsCommittee explains that the ICCPR requires that states establishappropriate judicial and administrative mechanisms for addressing claims ofrights violations under domestic law. It notes that “administrativemechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligationto investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly, and effectivelythrough independent and impartial bodies.” A failure to investigateallegations of violations may in and of itself give rise to a separate breachof the ICCPR. [37]Members of Native American tribes, like all other people inthe US, are entitled to the protection of international human rights law,including the right to an effective remedy. But US federal law and federalcourts have regularly ruled that tribal governments are sovereign and haveextensive and largely exclusive jurisdiction over their government structuresand tribal affairs such as the allocation of funds, distribution of essentialservices or benefits, and certain criminal matters.[38]Tribal governments have sole discretion as to whether they will provideremedies or create institutions to hold themselves accountable, but if they donot, tribal members have little recourse if they believe that the governmenthas violated their rights or engaged in other forms of misconduct.There are limited human rights protections under the IndianCivil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA) that prohibit tribal governments from violatingcertain rights such as freedom of speech. The law also provides for certainprotections for defendants in criminal cases held in tribal courts. But federalcourts have ruled that violations of those rights must first be adjudicated intribal courts since sovereign immunity of tribes is not waived for ICRA andtribal members cannot sue tribal governments in federal courts under the lawunless the action involves habeas corpus or is one that also implicates federallaw or federal action.[39]According to Singel, the status of tribal government can bevery problematic for the rights of tribal members and for good governance:The failure of the legal system to provide for tribalaccountability for human rights produces serious harms for Indian tribes andtheir politics. For example, victims of human rights abuses are often unable toobtain a remedy in any forum; their cases are frequently dismissed because ofsovereign immunity or lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In addition, theinability of victims to vindicate their rights prevents tribal governments frombeing held accountable for their actions and engaging in the reform anddevelopment that accountability would foster. A third effect is that dismissalscreate a growing unease with tribal sovereignty in the public, increasing therisk that Congress or the courts will take steps to change the law in a waythat diminishes tribal prerogatives of self-government.[40]Tribal governments also have discretion to set up their ownaccountability mechanisms. This is an explicit problem at Lower Brule becausethe Tribal Council has complete control over all parts of government and hasnot created any oversight mechanisms that would allow tribal members to hold itaccountable.[41]As a result, the Lower Brule Tribal Government, and theTribal Council in particular, have engaged in a range of actions that haveviolated and undermined the rights of tribal members.[42]It has also not informed members of its activities and has not set upaccountability mechanisms through which it can be held accountable.In addition to the human rights implications of itsactivities, the absence of transparency and accountability has meant that theTribal Government has not met basic standards of good governance deemedessential to foster development and respect for human rights under the UNDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.The declaration states that the enjoyment of the rightsenshrined in it are contingent on governments, such as tribal governments,respecting “principles of justice, democracy, respect for human rights,equality, non-discrimination, good governance, and good faith.”[43]While there is no universal definition of “good governance,”governments and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, WorldBank, and International Monetary Fund generally accept that it incorporatesfour key principles: transparency, accountability, participation, andresponsiveness to the needs and expectations of those who are governed.[44]These aspects of governance are absent at Lower Brule and thus make it moredifficult for tribal members to enjoy their rights.III. Lower Brule’s Tribal GovernmentAs part of a federally-recognized tribe, the Lower BruleTribal Government enjoys limited sovereignty but extensive authority overdomestic affairs on the reservation. That authority has slowly evolved overdecades in response to years of often destructive and misguided federal governmentpolicies towards Native Americans.Tribal governments have an extraordinary level of controlover resources and tribal members.[45] It ishard to overstate the importance and influence of the Lower Brule TribalGovernment, and the ruling Tribal Council in particular, on the political andeconomic lives of the residents of the reservation.As detailed below, many tribal members live in poverty andrely on the Tribal Government for assistance.Up to 41 percent of the 1,620-strongpopulation lives in poverty—almost three times the rate of the US as awhole.[46]Annual per capita income is $9,802-$13,386,compared to about $27,915 for the US as a whole.[47]Unemployment is 29 percent, more than fourtimes the national rate, making government jobs essential for staying out ofpoverty.[48] TheTribal Government employs about 70 percent of the reservation’sworkforce.[49]At least 34 percent of the population cannotmeet their basic nutritional needs and need supplemental food assistancethrough the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or“Food Stamps”) or the Federal Food Distribution Program on IndianReservations (FDPIR, or “Commodities” program).[50]The Tribal Government, and the council in particular, alsohave extensive authority over the private sector on the reservation. Thecouncil oversees tribally-owned businesses, regulates the reservation’s nascentprivate sector, allocates land for farming and ranching, and controls housingand social services. Therefore it has near complete control over all of theinstitutions that administer services or provide funds for those services.Tribal ConstitutionNative Americans have the same rights under US law as other peoplein the US in areas subject to federal or state government jurisdiction, but notnecessarily with respect to other issues that fall solely under tribal governmentjurisdiction. For example, tribal constitutions and laws may not extend thesame rights to tribal members as they enjoy under the US Constitution orfederal law with respect to judicial procedures and the structure of tribalgovernments.[51]Lower Brule’s Tribal Constitution was ratified in 1935and amended in 1986 to explicitly recognize that all tribal members “beaccorded equal opportunity to participate in the economic resources andactivities without prejudice” and “enjoy without hindrance freedomof worship, conscience, speech, press, assembly, and association.”[52]The constitution specifies that the elected six member Tribal Council is the reservation’ssupreme governing authority and has specific provisions and rules intended toensure open government and prevent transgressions by public officials.[53]Under Lower Brule’s constitution, the council acts as both thelegislative and the executive branch of government. The Tribal Council hasgranted the judiciary independence, but has said that the judiciary has limitedjurisdiction over the Tribal Council.[54] Thecouncil has not implemented any other independent oversight mechanisms over itsown actions. Its power is virtually unchecked on the reservation and as itpertains to members of the tribe.Tribal Council Membership and GovernanceTribal Council members are elected every two years.[55]It is not possible to detail the exact terms and tenures of Tribal Councilmembers because of the excessive secrecy of the Tribal Government, whichrefused to provide this information to Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watchcollated information on terms and tenures from individuals with knowledge ofTribal Government activities, press reports, and the results of the 2010 and2012 elections.The chairman of the Tribal Council is Michael Jandreau, whoaccording to his military records, served in the US Navy after graduating fromhigh school in the early 1960s. He left the Navy in the mid-1960s, but littleis known about his history between that time and when he joined the TribalCouncil in the early 1970s.[56]Human Rights Watch tried unsuccessfully to obtain a list ofpast Tribal Council members from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the SouthDakota state government’s Office of Tribal Relations, which both receivecopies of the list. Staff at both institutions recommended contacting the tribedirectly for older Tribal Council lists, citing a lack of records due to thefact their state government office was relatively new, or because the federalgovernment had archived the records at another location and would take sometime to obtain.[57] PattiGourneau, then-chief administrative assistant for the Tribal Council andrecorder of its meeting minutes, refused to provide information on theidentities and tenures of individuals who have served on the Tribal Council toHuman Rights Watch because she said Tribal Council critics would misuse thatinformation.[58]Tribal Council GovernanceThe Tribal Council oversees almost $35 million of tribal andfederal resources annually. The council needs a two-thirds majority to makedecisions. The Tribal Chairman only votes in a tie, so three people must votetogether to pass resolutions or ordinances.[59] Tribalmembers told Human Rights Watch that historically the chairman and his allieshave had a majority on the council and at most one or two council members mightbe considered independent.[60]Human Rights Watch research indicates that Chairman Jandreauhas the longest tenure of anyone on the Tribal Council.[61]Several other council members have also had very long tenures, including BoydGourneau, (Jandreau’s nephew and the current vice-chairman), and CouncilTreasurer John McCauley (also Jandreau’s nephew). Both Gourneau McCauleyhave been council members for at least a decade.[62]Other council members prior to the September 2014 elections were Orville“Red” Langdeau (a cousin of Jandreau), Darrell Middletent, andShawn Laroche. Human Rights Watch was unable to officially confirm councilmembers’ salaries, but estimates based on documentary evidence suggestthat council members receive an average annual compensation of approximately$81,000, around nine times the average annual per capita income at Lower Brule.[63]On September 2, 2014, a new Tribal Council was elected.Jandreau won the chairmanship by 25 votes, Orville Langdeau was electedsecretary-treasurer, and John McCauley won an at large seat. Kevin Wrightreplaced Boyd Gourneau as vice-chairman and Disirae LaRoche and former councilmember Sonny Ziegler also won seats.[64]Tribal JudiciaryThe Tribal Constitution authorizes a small tribal courtsystem and nominally independent judiciary.TheTribal Council has explicitly said that “courts are established under aquasi-separation of power relationship with the Tribal Government” and“[w]hile the Tribal Council is the final authority on the reservation, ithas formally acknowledged the legal authority necessarily vested in the TribalCourts.”[65] Underfederal law and court precedents, tribal courts do not have the inherentability to exercise judicial review over Tribal Government actions and must beexplicitly authorized by the Tribal Government to do so.[66]Tribal Council members can only be removed if they resign,permanently leave the reservation, or are found guilty of a felony, highmisdemeanor, or three low misdemeanors in a twelve month period while inoffice. The Tribal Council can remove a council member by a unanimous vote.Tribal members must follow a difficult process if they want to recall anygovernment official, including a Tribal Council member for alleged misconduct.The process of recalling a tribal government official requires tribal membersto file a petition of charges under the tribal Code of Ethics signed by atleast 30 percent of voters eligible in the last tribal election. The TribalCouncil itself decides whether the petition has merit. There is a right toappeal in tribal court, but the overall process is difficult for tribal membersbecause of the high threshold of voters needed to initiate that petition, thediscretion of the Tribal Council to initiate the removal, and uncertainty thatthe court would rule against the Tribal Council.[67]Challenging Tribal Council actions in the federal courts iscostly, time-consuming, and often precluded by legal barriers. Tribal membersfirst have to challenge the council through a tribal court and then persuade afederal court that the matter involves an issue that is not reservedexclusively for tribal jurisdiction. There are very limited options forremedies in federal courts because federal law is extremely deferential totribal governments with regard to tribal governance.[68]The only court case that Lower Brule tribal members have filed against theTribal Government was related to the 1982 election. This case was subsequentlyappealed to the US Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and later dismissed because theappeals court determined that federal courts did not have jurisdiction overtribal elections.[69]IV. Withholding of InformationThe Tribal Council refuses to make officialinformation such as budgets and audits available. It routinely violatesprovisions that ensure access to information in both international law and thetribe’s own federally-recognized constitution and bylaws. Articles I andIV of the Tribal Constitution’s bylaws state that decisions of the TribalCouncil shall be published “for the information and education of membersof the tribe.” The articles also stipulate that Tribal Councilresolutions, the orders that authorize budgeting and the allocation ofresources, “shall be recorded in a special book which shall be open topublic inspection.” The bylaws also state that the Tribal Councilsecretary “shall keep an accurate record of all matters transacted at theTribal Council meetings” and provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs with “copiesof all minutes of regular and special meetings of the Tribal Council.”[70]Budgetary and audit information would provide tribal membersand the public with information to ascertain what the Tribal Government isdoing, how it allocates public resources, and other decisions made on thetribe’s behalf. Without this, it is difficult for tribal members to holdtheir government to account. Moreover, there is no independent body within theTribal Government to hold the Tribal Council accountable. Under LowerBrule’s constitution the Tribal Council has authority over all governmentactivity. Anyone who has a complaint about how tribal officials or agenciesoperate can only petition the Tribal Council for redress.[71]Government SecrecyThere is strong evidence to suggest that the Tribal Councilbecame more secretive in 2007-2008 in response to growing scrutiny andcriticism over the management of public finances by some tribal members andsome Tribal Council members. An individual with knowledge of the tribe’sactivities and events at the time said:“There were groups of people starting to try to putthings on the Internet, documents and things, to expose some of the thingsgoing on…. [The Tribal Council] really tightened up on their keepingthings secret.”[72]In separate interviews Lee Brennan, the TribalGovernment’s general manager and most senior civil servant in TribalGovernment, and Tara Adamski, its general counsel, justified thecouncil’s decision to withhold official information on the grounds thatsome tribal members are “troublemakers” who “misused”public information to criticize Chairman Jandreau and other council members.[73]Sometime in 2013, the Tribal Government shut down itswebsite. After it was partially reinstated in May 2014, it had only limitedinformation about the government and its activities. Some basic informationsuch as contact information for the government is no longer available on thewebsite.[74] Thewebsites of other tribal governments such as those at Cheyenne RiverReservation, Rosebud, Crow Creek, and Pine Ridge in South Dakota regularlyprovide at least some information about the members of government and recordsof their activities and decisions.Withholding of InformationAccess to basic information about tribal governance is generallywithheld and information is not just denied to people perceived to begovernment critics. Withholding information appears to be a systematic practiceaffecting all who might seek information, including tribal members, the Bureauof Indian Affairs, human rights organizations, and even some members of theTribal Council. The result is that few if any people outside of certain TribalCouncil members and civil servants who oversee the finances of the tribe have acomplete and comprehensive picture of how the council makes its decisions, whatdecisions are made, and how tribal funds are spent.Some members of the tribe told Human Rights Watch that they weredenied basic information about government activities. On August 23, 2013, forexample, four prominent members of the tribe wrote a joint letter to formallyrequest copies of meeting minutes, financial records, and a briefing by TribalCouncil members in order to assess how public funds were used.In their letter, they noted that the government had notdisclosed information for years and said that they “would like to beinformed about the financial status of the tribe to understand what funds we asa tribe have and how it is being expended.”[75]Since the Tribal Council is the only body that can release such records, theywrote to John McCauley, then-council secretary who was responsible for keepingsuch records, but received no reply or documents at time of writing.[76]The Tribal Council’s denial of such informationviolates tribal members’ constitutionally authorized access to suchinformation, undermines their right to information, and makes it very difficultfor them to exercise any oversight over their elected public officials’ useof tribal and federal resources.From the Bureau of IndianAffairsThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has legal oversight overcertain aspects of tribal governments, including the authority to examineTribal Council resolutions. Article VI of Lower Brule’s constitutionspecifies that the BIA must review and approve Tribal Council resolutions.[77]However, one government official in a position to be familiar with thisresponsibility said the tribe began withholding some key information from theBIA and started sending only selected resolutions in 2007.[78]Human Rights Watch was unable to confirm whether this was the case with theBureau of Indian Affairs or the Tribal Council. The Tribal Council did notrespond to repeated requests for information and James Two-Bulls, the superintendentof the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Lower Brule, would not comment on thatmatter when Human Rights Watch contacted him.[79]An individual with knowledge of the TribalGovernment’s activities told Human Rights Watch that the BIA has notobjected to the Tribal Government’s practice of withholding some keyinformation, and that the bureau believes it does not necessarily need to haveall information unless it pertains to areas of BIA involvement or oversight.On April 11, 2013, Human Rights Watch contacted the regionaloffice of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that is responsible for Lower Brulerequesting Tribal Council resolutions and budget documents. They said tribalgovernments do not always send such information to the BIA and referred Human RightsWatch to James Two-Bulls, the highest-ranking BIA official at Lower Brule.[80]When contacted by telephone on April 11, 2013 to request copies of TribalCouncil resolutions and budget documents, Two-Bulls would not release thedocuments without the Tribal Council’s approval. He asked Human RightsWatch to file a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain information aboutfederal funding that the Tribal Government received.[81]Human Rights Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act requestwith the BIA for budget and financial information on August 15, 2013, but didnot receive a response. A second request was submitted on June 27, 2014. BIAofficials telephoned Human Rights Watch in response to that request on November21, 2014. They said that the Tribal Government’s lawyer did not want themto release any information to Human Rights Watch. The BIA suggested that HumanRights Watch could request a more limited amount of information, but HumanRights Watch requested that the BIA continue to negotiate with the TribalGovernment for the all of the information requested.[82]Of the dozens of people Human Rights Watch interviewed whohad direct knowledge about the distribution of resolutions, budgets, and auditsor who tried to obtain that information as a tribal member, only Tara Adamski,the Tribal Government’s general counsel, claimed that they were publiclyavailable.[83] Severalcurrent and former tribal and federal government officials told Human RightsWatch that government employees could be fired for publicly disclosingdocuments, such as federal audits, even if the documents are considered publicinformation or should be disclosed under the Tribal Constitution.[84]From Independent Tribal Council MembersTribal Council members have access to general information aboutgovernment operations, but according to documents reviewed by Human RightsWatch and interviews with former Tribal Council members, specific informationabout government activity and the use of public funds is withheld from thepublic.Four former Tribal Council members told Human Rights Watchthat information was withheld from them while serving on the council. BenThompson (1992-1996 and 2002-2004) and Sonny Ziegler (2000-2006 and 2014-present)said that they requested detailed information about the state of the tribalgovernment’s finances and other issues related to the management ofpublic funds from the chairman or tribal staff. Their requests were refused andthey were unable to obtain that information during their tenure on the council.Both Ziegler and Thompson are considered independent of the chairman.[85]“When we were on the council and we wanted something[such as budget information], we couldn’t get it,” Thompson said.[86]From Human Rights WatchTribal officials were unresponsive and even hostile torequests by Human Rights Watch for public information. On April 26, 2013, HumanRights Watch went to the Tribal Government offices at Lower Brule and asked fordocuments in person. The documents requested by Human Rights Watch should bepublic documents according to the Tribal Constitution. Members of the TribalCouncil were not present, but Lee Brennan, the tribe’s general manager,said that in order to access the documents, Human Rights Watch would have toformally request them from the Tribal Council, which must pass a new resolutionauthorizing Human Rights Watch to view the documents.[87]Tribal Council members had not responded at time of writingto four written information requests by Human Rights Watch and two phone callswith the Tribal Government’s general counsel for resolutions, minutes ofmeetings, audits, and budgets from 2002 to 2013. We also requested to meet withthe Tribal Council but they did not respond to Human Rights Watch’srequests.The Tribal Government sought to have federal authoritieswithhold information from Human Rights Watch. Almost all of the TribalGovernment’s funds for housing come from the US Department of Housing andUrban Development (HUD) and Human Rights Watch filed a Freedom of InformationAct request to obtain information about those programs at Lower Brule. TheTribal Council sought to have information pertaining to the request withheld.According to a HUD representative, this constituted the first time that theycould recall a tribal government trying to withhold information in response toa FOIA request.[88] Thedepartment eventually sent Human Rights Watch hundreds of pages of documentsregarding their funding to the Tribal Government, several months after HumanRights Watch’s initial request.V. Mismanagement of Public FundsHuman Rights Watch obtained government documents and otherofficial records that showed that the Tribal Government engaged in widespread mismanagementof public funds. Those activities led to scarce resources being diverted fromessential services and programs intended to help the poor, undermining tribalmembers’ economic and social rights in the process.[89]This section details how such funds were clearly diverted from their intendedpurposes, often from programs such as water, education, and other services.The amount of those diverted funds are substantial in the contextof the overall tribal budget. According to audit reports and other informationdetailed below, the Tribal Government has not provided information on how anestimated $25 million was spent between 2007 and 2013. Most of this amount wasexplicitly for programs meant to provide essential services, alleviate poverty,or promote much needed economic development.Annual audits of Tribal Government revenues and expendituresand are federally-mandated because Lower Brule receives substantial federalfunds. Such audits are key to understanding tribal government’sactivities.[90] Knownas the “single audit,” “combined federal audit,” or the“A-133 audit,”[91] theyare not detailed forensic audits, just a sample of tribal expenditures, butnonetheless provide an invaluable financial picture of the Tribal Government.The Lower Brule Tribal Government’s finances arelargely secret, undermining the right of tribal members to information andmaking it very difficult for them to know the financial state of thegovernment, any key liabilities, or whether the government has applied theirlimited resources towards providing basic social services.Human Rights Watch has also found that several tribalentities were not disclosed in these audits, and perhaps to auditors, includingmaterial transactions with the Tribal Government worth at least $1 millionrelated to its purchase of the Westrock brokerage firm.Overview of Government Revenues and ExpendituresThe 2012 tribal audit shows that the Tribal Government hadannual expenditures of about $33.8 million with about $44.1 million in revenuesfor the year. The revenues included a one-time federal settlement payment (theSalazar settlement) of about $14.2 million as compensation for the federalgovernment’s historical mismanagement of the tribe’s naturalresources.[92]Once Salazar funds are subtracted, the TribalGovernment’s recurring revenue is about $29.9 million. Of that, about$21.6 million comes from US taxpayer funds as grants or other programs. Federalfunds comprise about 72 percent of the Tribal Government’s recurringrevenues and some 64 percent of the tribe’s overall expenditures.[93]The tribe has accumulated long-term debt of almost $33 million, most of it (about$26 million) for long term bond issuances to finance the government’soperations.[94]Several tribally-owned businesses are disclosed in thesingle audit, but a complete picture of their finances is difficult to discern becausekey financial information is not fully included and the Tribal Government doesnot disclose many details about their operations. Information that is disclosedin the federal audits includes their revenue contribution to the TribalGovernment. For example, the Lower Brule Farm Corporation (LBFC) is a tribally-ownedprivate entity that oversees the government’s ranching and farminginterests and is managed by the Lucky 7 Ranch, a non-Native owned business. Itcontributed about $1.2 million in revenue to the Tribal Government. The GoldenBuffalo Casino made about $1.6 million that was transferred to the government.[95]Land leases provide another key source of revenue. The tribeowns much of the land on the reservation and that land is held in trust by theBIA. That land can be leased to individual members or institutions with councilapproval. In 2012, income from tribal members, the BIA, and others was morethan $1.5 million.[96]A glaring oversight in the audits since 2007 is the lack ofmention of the Lower Brule Corporation (LBC), a tribally-owned and controlled entitycreated in 2007 under a federally approved charter. Through its subsidiaries thecorporation undertook almost $1 million in transactions with the Tribal Governmentin 2009.[97]In June 2011, almost three months before the reportingperiod for the 2012 audit ended, an entity LBC purchased through itssubsidiaries went bankrupt that had apparently owed the tribal entity more than$8 million, about 25 percent of tribal expenditures that year. The bankruptcydocuments were signed by then-Tribal Vice-Chairman Boyd Gourneau who was alsoon the board of that company. Based on company records, Chairman Jandreau, then-TreasurerMcCauley, and Council member “Red” Langdeau were on the board.Financial MismanagementIn 2007, the Tribal Government’s comptroller told theTribal Council that the government received “a favorable audit” andcalled it “a very good review” because no major financial problems werefound.[98] Sincethen, financial oversight and management have deteriorated, according to themagnitude and severity of problems that independent auditors reported insubsequent federal audits of the tribe’s finances.[99]In all of the cases detailed below, Human Rights Watchcontacted the Tribal Council for their perspectives on these matters and for anupdate on any developments related to them. At time of writing, we have notreceived any response from the Tribal Council or the Tribal Governmentgenerally.The tribe’s auditors reported numerous “materialweaknesses” in the annual audits of the government. According to theauditors, material weaknesses describe a lack of internal controls so deficientthat it would be very difficult to identify or prevent the misuse of funds.[100]That creates a high risk that an entity such as the Tribal Government maymaterially misstate how such funds were actually used since it does notproperly account for them.[101] Suchproblems require further explanation and could require repayment of federalfunds.[102] Theseactivities could also be subject to further federal investigations if there isevidence of waste, fraud, or abuse.In its 2008 audit, Eide Bailly, the tribe’s auditors,reported that Tribal Government had improperly transferred about $780,000 infederal funds meant to pay for the water supply on the reservation to itsdiscretionary accounts instead of keeping them in a specific account for waterexpenditures, as required under federal rules. The government then spent themoney for other purposes. In this case, the Tribal Government did not disclosethe use of funds, but acknowledged they had been improperly transferred andagreed to repay them.[103] In2009, problems related to the improper transfer of funds increased. EideBailly’s 2009 audits found five material weaknesses in tribal financialreports, including:Several misstated transactions;Misstated use of federal funds;Improper payments of more than $175,000 insalaries billed to the wrong accounts;Improper use of federal funds for water to coverunspecified expenses; andSocial welfare payments to people withoutverifying their eligibility.Auditors also found that the tribe had paid fourunidentified employees a total of about $34,000 in bonuses without any policyor system to justify such payments. The Tribal Government did not disagree withthose findings. It said it would repay the missing water funds and was workingto correct the serious problems that auditors found.[104]The 2010 audit revealed some of the same problems, and foundnew ones. Again, the tribe failed to ensure the eligibility of recipients of keywelfare programs, continued to divert federal water funds to pay tribaldeficits, misstated federal expenditures, used federal funds intended to helpthe poorest people on the reservation to close a Tribal Government budgetdeficit, and did not keep or have a system to keep records to justify howgovernment employees used tribally-owned credit cards.The Tribal Council agreed with the findings, said it wasrepaying the water funds, and gave assurances that it would correct the othershortcomings.[105] Attime of writing Human Rights Watch could not confirm whether the funds wererepaid.In 2011, the Tribal Government had repeated problems that itpreviously committed to fix. It again failed to ensure recipients were actuallyeligible for welfare programs, used federal funds from programs to help thepoor to pay other expenses and close tribal deficits, and a lack of internalcontrols led to a tribal government employee “fraudulently writing offcharges totaling $6,000.”[106] Thetribe acknowledged the problems and committed to fix them.[107]The most recent 2012 audit again showed the TribalGovernment taking funds intended to help the poor and using them to cover otherexpenses and close government deficits and failing to determine whether peoplewere truly eligible for welfare payments. The auditors also questioned morethan $150,000 in personnel expenditures that supervisors did not account forproperly. The Tribal Government agreed with those findings and promised to do abetter job tracking these expenses.[108]Laws that govern the flow of federal funds to tribalgovernments, notably the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Actof 1975, allows the federal government to administer social programs on behalfof tribal governments and contract federal funds to tribal governments toadminister those programs themselves. The law also allows the federalgovernment to take over social programs from the tribe and administer themdirectly at the request of a tribal government or because of mismanagementunder a process known as “retrocession.”[109]However, retrocession can be controversial and is a laborious, expensive, anduncommon process.[110] InSeptember 2012, for example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs indefinitely tookover social services of the Spirit Lake Tribal Government in North Dakota afterit determined that the allegations by a whistleblower regarding mismanagementand child abuse in the Tribal Social Services program had merit.[111]There has been no effort by the federal government to takeover any social programs at Lower Brule and administer them directly. Nor hasthere been any request by the Tribal Government to do so.Missing US Federal FundsHuman Rights Watch investigated two cases where audits foundthe Tribal Government had diverted federal funds to cover its own unexplainedexpenditures. The US government knew of both cases. Both led to millions ofdollars in diversions from social welfare funds, including those meant for thepoorest people on the reservation, and funds intended to provide and maintainthe water supply at Lower Brule.At least $2.6 million in federal funds intended for keysocial welfare programs were inexplicably diverted. Another $1.2 million infederal funds to ensure the steady flow of water to the reservation was alsodiverted. The missing funds represented between 12 and 18 percent of the TribalGovernment’s annual expenditures.Many financial agreements with the federal government arecolloquially known as “638 Contracts” to reflect that they areauthorized under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of1975. This law is meant in part to strengthen tribal sovereignty by allowingtribal governments to manage federal funds that are supposed to pay foressential services like education or health. A substantial portion of thosefunds may come from the federal government, but tribal governments areresponsible for administering the funds.Almost half of the Lower Brule Tribal Government’sannual revenue comes from the federal government. In total, Lower Brulereceived about $20.3 million in federal funding in 2012 for social programs andother government operations, or about 46 percent of its overall revenue. Onefactor that should be noted, however, is that the tribe received a one-time legalsettlement from the federal government that year for more than $14 million.Without counting this one-time settlement towards the tribe’s revenuesfor that year, other federal funding makes up a significantly higher percentageof total revenue, or around 68 percent, which is consistent with prior years.[112]The federal government often prepays the tribe for thesocial services and other activities it should administer in the upcoming year,which allows the Tribal Government to draw on the funds as needed for theseservices and activities. The tribe follows the US government’s October 1-September30 fiscal year.According to Tribal Government annual audits, some federalfunds were diverted into the tribe’s opaque general budget, which poolsmultiple sources of revenue and can be spent at the Tribal Council’sdiscretion, unlike restricted funds such as federal government funds for socialservices. General fund expenditures are subject to little oversight and theTribal Government has yet to account for how the money was spent.Since federal funds can only be used for their intendedpurposes, they should appear as a surplus or in reserve if they are unspent.However, the FY2011 audit showed that the government diverted about $2.6million of government funds into its general budget from programs meant tosupply essential services to poor tribal members.[113]In this case, Eide Bailly’s auditors found that the money was taken fromthe federal program to fund schools and the cash assistance program to helpsome of the poorest people on the reservation, including children, the elderly,and disabled meet their basic needs.[114] Theauditors found such problems constituted a “Material Weakness” inthe tribe’s management because it could lead to serious noncompliancewith the rules regarding the use of federal funds.[115]That finding prompted the Bureau of Indian Affairs to send aletter to Chairman Jandreau on November 15, 2012, asking him to provide a planto correct the situation, a list of accounts that caused the revenue deficit,and to “certify that these funds have since been replaced” so thatthey would not have to withhold that amount from future funding. The BIA didnot ask how the $2.6 million had actually been used or whether the intendedbeneficiaries were affected by the diversion of funds.[116]The Tribal Government did not account for the diverted fundsand the problem remained unresolved the following year, according to the tribe’sFY2012 audit.[117] The TribalCouncil refused to explain the use of funds to Human Rights Watch. However, oneofficial acknowledged that the Tribal Government did not use the funds for theintended programs and reportedly promised to repay the missing federal fundsfrom a multimillion dollar settlement from the US government.[118]At time of writing, the Tribal Council did not respond to requests by HumanRights Watch regarding the use of those funds or whether the federal governmenthad been repaid.What Happened to the Money?Two Unexplained GapsTheSalazar SettlementTheSalazar settlement was an approximately $18 million settlementbetween the Lower Brule Sioux Tribeand the federal government—part of a $3.4 billion settlement withtribes throughout the country due to federal mismanagement of tribal land andother resources.Of the $18million about $3.76 million was allocated to attorney’s fees and otherlegal costs and the Lower Brule tribal government received about $14.2million. The council spent about $4.3 million to pay government debts andaccumulated shortfalls. It allocated $1.8 million to repay land andoperations loans, $1 million to cover payroll, and $1.5 million for theirgeneral fund. The balance of about $10 million was deposited in account untilthe Tribal Government decided how to spend it.[119]It is notclear how all of the money has been spent, and the Tribal Council has notdisclosed what it plans to do with it. On December 6, 2012, the councilannounced that it would distribute $750 to each living tribe member enrolledbefore November 20, 2012.[120]According to the BIA, there areabout 3,410 tribal members on and off the reservation.[121]The per-capita payment total wouldhave been about $2.56 million, leaving the Tribal Government a balance ofapproximately $7.44 million. The government did not disclose how it intendedto use those funds and has not publicly accounted for it at time of writing.[122]TheRural Water ProgramThe MniWiconi water project was a federal program that began 1988 to build waterinfrastructure, primarily at the Lower Brule, Rosebud, and Pine Ridgereservations because there was a lack of potable water there and in otherparts of rural South Dakota. The program funds the water infrastructure andrelated operating costs needed to supply residents with adequate watersupplies.[123]Planning for the project began in1993 and the infrastructure was completed in the fall of 2013, but ongoingfederal funding is needed to pay for operation and maintenance costs in orderto ensure safe supplies of water to an estimated 55,000 people in rural SouthDakota.[124]Thecompletion of the project had been delayed for years due to chronic federalunderfunding. Similarly, maintenance of the infrastructure was alsounderfunded after parts of the water system were completed.For example, the Pine Ridge reservationtook its first delivery of water in 2008.[125]At Lower Brule, however, anotherkey reason why potable water supplies were delayed is because the tribalgovernment mismanaged water project funds.In 1999,the US Department of Interior’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG)issued a highly critical report of the Lower Brule tribal government’spoor planning related to the project and its mismanagement of Mni Wiconifunds. It found that there were cost overruns of some $7.1 million. TheBureau of Reclamation and the Tribal Government decided to expand the scopeof the project and the Inspector General’s report concluded some of theestimated $7.1 million in overruns were justified expenses.[126]However, the OIG also found thatunlike other tribal governments involved in the project, Lower Brule’sgovernment made no effort to design or hire experts to design a water systemthat would actually meet the needs of people on the reservation when theproject was first planned.[127]As a result, the true cost of providingwater to Lower Brule was much higher than estimated and led to millions ofdollars in cost overruns for the project.[128]Eventhough the project was already underfunded due to mismanagement, funds wereeven scarcer because the Lower Brule Tribal Government improperly spent atleast $155,451 on vehicles, salaries, and travel for staff, office equipment,and other costs that were not used for the water project. It also paid$73,074 in salary and benefits to a person that the OIG report said the tribedid not provide any documentation to justify or “identi[fy] the workperformed and how it related to the [Mni Wiconi] System.”[129]The mostcritical finding by the Inspector General was that Tribal Council members hadpaid themselves a total of $22,000 out of those funds and another $3,000 forsecretarial services from February 1995 to April 1996, purportedly aspayments to members of a water oversight board known as the “MniWiconi Steering Committee.” But the OIG could not find any evidencethat such a Steering Committee ever met to perform any work related to thewater project. Instead, the OIG reported that the committee “conductedits business during Tribal Council meetings.” The report also stated,“we could not find, and the tribe did not provide, separate minutes ofmeetings for the Steering Committee showing that business related to theSystem was conducted to justify the payment of stipends.”[130]The OIG reported that stipends werepaid throughout 1996 without any supporting documentation showing anymeetings were held.[131]Ultimately,the OIG and Bureau of Reclamation agreed that $98,074 of those funds shouldbe paid back to the federal government unless the Tribal Government couldprovide justification for those expenses. The OIG did not recommend any othercourse of action.[132]Human Rights Watch could notdetermine whether they had been repaid.In 2009,almost 10 years after the OIG’s report, the US Department of theInterior’s Bureau of Reclamation in a letter to Chairman Jandreau askedfor a meeting with the Tribal Government to discuss 2006 and 2007 audits thatrevealed $1.2 million in federal funds designated for water projects“were used for other purposes and were not returned to theproject.”[133]The bureau asked for the meeting“due to the seriousness of this issue and the magnitude of moneyinvolved,” to determine the use of such funds, their repayment, and howto avoid future problems.[134]Severalmonths of discussions between the Bureau of Reclamation and the TribalGovernment followed. The stalemate held up the disbursement of fundsavailable to the tribe under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act(ARRA), also known as the Obama administration’s “stimuluspackage,” which came into force in February 2009.[135]Theobligation to repay those diverted funds to the federal government couldpotentially lead to a further loss of $1.2 million to the Tribal Governmentand undermine its ability to maintain the water supply and other socialwelfare projects from which funds were originally diverted. Gayle Ziegler, amember of the Tribal Council at that time, alleged in letters to the Bureauof Indian Affairs that funds from other social programs were diverted fromother essential social programs to repay the funds, but she did not receive areply.[136]Later, the tribal governmentagreed to repay the funds to the US government at a rate of $25,000 a monthbecause it did not have enough money to repay all of the funds at once.[137]To Human Rights Watch’sknowledge, there was no further investigation into the use of those funds, orthe impact of repayment on the programs from which they were diverted. The TribalGovernment did not respond to requests for clarification.The Human Rights Impact of Diverted FundsThere is evidence to suggest that increasing secrecy and thediversion of funds may have correlated with a decline in the quality ofeducation available at Lower Brule, and has had a negative impact on the rightsof tribal members, especially children, because of the impact on the educationsystem.As noted above, an unspecified amount of the $2.6 million infederal funds that were diverted came from federal funds that are the mainsource of funding for the Lower Brule school system.[138]That meant that the Tribal Government did not invest its available resourcesinto education, even when those funds were solely designated for that purpose.The total amount of federal funding from the Departments of Interior andEducation designated for Lower Brule’s education system in fiscal year2012 was approximately $5.5 million.[139]During the 2007-08 school year, the same year when theTribal Council began to withhold information about its activities,approximately 54.7 percent of students were proficient or advanced readers andabout 39.8 percent were proficient or advanced in math at Lower Brule’sschools.[140] By the2011-12 school year, the last available for Lower Brule and more than a yearafter the Tribal Council diverted education funds, only about 25 percent ofstudents were proficient or advanced in reading and only about 25.7 wereproficient or advanced in math.[141]Lower Brule’s school system at all levels is run bythe Tribal Government but funded by the federal government through 638Contracts. Lower Brule’s schools are among the 183 tribally-run schoolsthat fall under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Interior’sBureau of Indian Education (BIE) instead of state and local governments as istypical for public school systems in the United States.[142]Lower Brule’s schools had higher achievement ratesthan the national average for all BIE funded and tribally-run schools in the2007-08 school year. Nationally, 38.4 percent of students were proficient oradvanced in reading while 32.6 percent were proficient or advanced in math.[143]The BIE’s most recent national data that analyzesperformance during the 2010-11 school year showed that Lower Brule had fallenwell below performance average by the 2011-12 year. National averages showedthat approximately 41.4 percent of students at tribally-run schools wereadvanced or proficient in reading while 32.8 percent were proficient oradvanced in math—much higher than the declining performance levels atLower Brule schools.[144]Human Rights Watch spoke to parents of school-age childrenat Lower Brule and educators about the quality of Lower Brule schools.[145]People consistently said that the quality of education and the environment atLower Brule schools were very poor and that many parents sent their kids to theclosest state public schools in Lyman and Brule Counties because that was theonly reasonable way for their children to get an adequate education. However,the closest schools outside the Lower Brule Reservation are 40-50 miles away,and in difficult winter weather conditions it becomes extremely challenging forchildren to go to school.Theresa M.[146] toldHuman Rights Watch that she was considering quitting her job to home school herfive-year-old daughter because she did not want such a young child commuting80-100 miles every day to school. She also noted that it was “survival ofthe fittest” at Lower Brule schools, but it would be“miraculous” if they worked properly. In her view, children on thereservation, including those too poor to commute or those who come from verychallenging home environments who have little or no adult supervision, do nothave access to quality education.[147]Amanda R., another member of the tribe and mother of twosmall children, said that she would never have attended Lower Brule’sschools, and would not send her children to schools or daycare there:The possibility of getting a decent education in LowerBrule is slim to none and a lot of kids go to school in Chamberlain orKennebec.… I don’t know if funds are managed well, but I know acousin of mine went there and said ‘we don’t even have enough mathbooks.’ Another cousin went to school in Colorado and then went back as afreshman in high school or eighth grader to Lower Brule and they were two yearsbehind her public school in Colorado as far as math was concerned. They [schoolofficials] even asked her whether she wanted to move ahead a grade because theywere so far behind.… No place is trustworthy there to take my kids.[148]South Dakota state education statistics illustrate thediscrepancies between Lower Brule’s schools and schools in adjacentcounties. In the Chamberlain school district in Brule County, 70 percent ofchildren in all grades were proficient or advanced in reading while 76 percentwere proficient or advanced in math during the 2011-12 school year. NativeAmerican students in Chamberlain also performed far better than theircounterparts at Lower Brule, with 57 percent proficient or advanced in readingand 68 percent proficient or advanced in math.[149]At a minimum, school performance levels were more than double that at LowerBrule. Many parents at Lower Brule send their children to schools in adjacentcounties instead of their local schools because they feel they are better fortheir children.The discrepancy between Lyman County, where Kennebec islocated, and Lower Brule schools is even greater. Student performance in LymanCounty schools was more than three times higher than Lower Brule’s. InLyman County, 76 percent of children in all grades were proficient or advancedin reading and 86 percent were proficient or advanced in math. 71 percent ofNative American students in Lyman County schools were proficient or advanced inreading and 81 percent were proficient or advanced in math.[150]By the end of 2013, the decline of Lower Brule’sschools was so severe that the school system was forced into“restructuring” as required by the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act.Under that law, any school that fails to make adequate progress in studentachievement for five years must restructure in order to be eligible for federalfunds. Restructuring can include replacing all or most of school staff, contractingwith a management company to take over administration of schools, or turning aschool into a public charter school.[151]In December 2013, the Tribal Government removed much of theschool administration, dissolved the school board, and contracted with the AmericanIndian Institute for Innovation, a nonprofit educational firm, to helprestructure and take over administration of the schools.[152]VI. Conflicts of InterestLack of access to information, inadequate accounting forfederal funds, unexplained transfers that suggest budgetary mismanagement, andlax federal oversight has made it difficult for tribal members to secure theirrights. Conflicts of interest between the personal economic interests of TribalCouncil members and their public responsibilities are another element that hasmade government accountability difficult to achieve. In particular, whencouncil members are principals of tribally-owned companies, their personalinterests may not align with the interests of tribal members who are the stakeholdersof these enterprises and on whose behalf they are supposed to function.In Lower Brule, tribal businesses have been set up in amanner that allows individual Tribal Government officials or their businessassociates to personally profit from the use of public resources, thusdiverting scarce funds away from activities that could help to realize therights of tribal members. The 1999 Office of Inspector General’s reporton the Mni Wiconi Water Project first exposed and criticized thispractice when Tribal Council members apparently appointed themselves to a wateroversight board and paid themselves thousands of dollars as members, but couldnot produce any evidence that the water board did any work.[153]From a human rights perspective, these practices violatetribal members’ right to information since they are largely secret. Theyalso may affect economic and social rights as these arrangements involve theuse of public funds that could be used to provide for essential services on thereservation.Since these activities involve the tribe’s ownresources under Tribal Council jurisdiction, there is little if any oversightby the federal government, and tribal members who want to allege wrongdoinghave little recourse to do so. As noted earlier, these are decisions that, ifofficially authorized, are very difficult to challenge.Chairman Jandreau and other Tribal Council members can officiallycreate or control tribally-owned business, allocate Tribal Government funds andresources to and from those businesses, and can profit from those transactionsas board members of those businesses. When information on these financial andfiduciary relationships is withheld from the public, there is little check onthe perception of self-dealing. For people both within and outside thegovernment, the perception that the Tribal Council, its family members, andallies benefit from tribal largesse while others are ignored is a common sourceof dissatisfaction and distrust on the reservation.Ben “Bugsy” Thompson, a former Tribal Councilmember from 1992-96 and 2002-04 explained that he was concerned that there was“no fair play” on the council. Instead, those seen as close to thecouncil benefited while others did not. “If you’re just a littleperson you don’t get any help at all,” said Thompson.“That’s why you have so many disgruntled people—pissed offpeople.”[154]Two areas where there is a strong perception of bias are inthe allocation of land and alleged self-dealing by council members and theirassociates. Tribal Council members exercise control over tribally-owned businessesand other agencies for which the tribe has fiduciary responsibility.[155]These include the Lower Brule Farm Corporation and the Lower Brule HousingAuthority, which run the tribe’s agricultural business and managemaintenance and allocation of housing on the reservation.[156]Legally separate from the Tribal Government, they do not have to disclose theirdeliberations or all of their detailed financial information to tribal membersor to the public.[157]Each entity has its own board of directors. In its audits,the Tribal Council has said it is independent from these entities and that itssole authority over them is to appoint an independent board to exerciseoversight on its behalf.[158]In reality, council members appoint themselves as paid directors of theboards, which Tribal Council members oversee. For example, Chairman Jandreau andVice-Chairman Gourneau chair the boards of the Lower Brule Corporation and itssubsidiaries.The individual cases below do not involve enormous sums ofmoney, but collectively demonstrate how an entrenched council can controlsizeable tribal resources without meaningful oversight.Lower Brule CorporationThe tribe formed the Lower Brule Corporation (LBC) in 2007ostensibly to function as a lucrative venture that would acquire new businessesand profit from them tax-free. As this report will explain in greater detailbelow, LBC ultimately made the ill-fated acquisition of the Westrock Groupthrough LBC’s wholly owned subsidiaries.A key issue in forming the LBC was the composition, role,and benefits of its board of directors. Its formation provides insight into howcouncil members institutionalized a governance structure that would almostcertainly lead to conflicts of interest between individual council members andthe tribe’s overall interests.Federal law requires that such a company is wholly owned bya tribe, but the company can have an independent board of directors. Independenceis advised to avoid politics and conflicts of interest, and to allow thebusiness to operate independent of the Tribal Government and in thetribe’s best interests.[159] Underthe rules the council devised, however, the LBC’s board would have to beTribal Council members. Therefore, Lower Brule’s Tribal Council chose toretain control over the business—a potentially lucrative move for theboard if the venture succeeded, albeit with potentially serious conflicts ofinterest for them as elected public servants.LBC’s charter and other governance documents authorizecompensation for board members, including Tribal Council members. It alsoallows board members or their families to do business with the company or tohold financial interests in companies that do business with LBC.[160]The charter specifies that public officials who sit on its board should act inthe corporation’s best interest.[161] LBC canalso create subsidiaries with their own boards.[162]Without strong conflict of interest regulation, that can potentially allow thesame people to receive compensation from several subsidiary boards and toprofit from business with those subsidiary companies too. This is what happenedin the ill-fated Westrock investment described in further detail below.Lower Brule Farm CorporationThe Lower Brule Farm Corporation (LBFC) is a multimillion dollaroperation that manages the tribe’s farming operations and is wholly ownedby the Tribal Government and controlled by the Tribal Council. In the 2012 fiscalyear, it contributed at least $1.2 million to the Tribal Government out ofapproximately $29.8 million in recurring revenue.[163]Although the Tribal Government owns it, LBFC’sdeliberations and activities are not publicly disclosed or even disclosed tomembers of the tribe. LBFC’s financial records and other key informationabout its activities are not available to tribal members, and detailedfinancial information about LBFC is not included in Tribal Government audits.[164]Structurally, the LBFC shares 25 percent of its profits withthe Lucky Seven Ranch, a private farming company, because Lucky Seven iscontracted to manage LBFC’s operations.[165]That arrangement has been under federal investigation since 2009 overpossible improprieties in the management of tribal lands and livestock.[166]Members of the LBFC board have included Chairman Jandreau, other councilmembers, and business associates of the tribe.[167]According to documents obtained by Human Rights Watch, representatives of theLucky Seven Ranch are also on the LBFC board, but constitute a minority on theboard. The Tribal Council refused to provide Human Rights Watch with a currentlist of board members.Human Rights Watch requested board meeting minutes from theTribal Council members on the Lower Brule Farm Corporation board, but they didnot respond to these requests. However, Human Rights Watch obtained someminutes of board meetings from other sources that illustrate instances when theLBFC board authorized payments to themselves, even as some also served aspublic officials overseeing this publicly-owned corporation. Thesetransactions, while not large, are considered significant in a tribe where theaverage yearly income is approximately $10,000. At the least, they raisequestions about the perception of self-dealing in a small governing body wheremany individuals are related through family and business ties. Some examplesinclude:At a June 16, 2001 board meeting, ChairmanJandreau who also served on the board of LBFC said he wanted to be paid by LBFCat the rate of $28 an hour for the 80 hours of work he said was required tosecure a loan for the Farm Corporation. In effect, the head of governmentwanted the government-owned farm corporation to pay him additional funds forwork he did on its behalf. The board authorized payment of $2,240. BillThompson, then a board member on LBFC, noted that he was paid $1,500 a month bythe farm board and wanted a 5 percent salary increase. The board agreed.[168]During an October 2002 board meeting, ScottJones, the chairman’s half-brother and a Tribal Government employee,proposed that members who have served on the Farm Corporation board for atleast 15 years should receive $7,000 “cash compensation.” ChairmanJandreau, Dennis Ickes, and Bill Thompson qualified for that payment. He alsoproposed that they should receive an additional $1,000 annually as long as theyserved on the board. The resolution passed, though Ickes, Jandreau, andThompson abstained from the vote.[169]Lower Brule Water AuthorityThe Lower Brule Water Authority is the Tribal Governmentagency that ensures that water flows properly throughout the reservation. It isat least partly funded by the federal government as part of the Department ofInterior’s Mni Wiconi Rural Water Supply Project.[170]Since at least 2004, Tribal Council members have appointed themselves to theLower Brule Steering Committee for the Water Authority, for which they werepaid at least $300 per meeting. For example, in 2003 the water authorityallocated $14,400 to Tribal Council members for the board meetings they weresupposed to attend in 2004.[171]LandAt Lower Brule the Tribal Council is the sole authority thatcan allocate land to tribal members, including Tribal Council members. Thiscreates the possibility of conflicts of interest and the perception ofself-dealing, especially because these transactions are not publicly disclosed.Land is often the most valuable commodity on a reservation. The federalgovernment holds land in trust on behalf of the tribe on reservations. Triballand cannot be bought and sold to individuals and must instead be leased fromthe tribe. Once an individual has a lease in good standing, that person can usethe land or can sublease the land to another party for a higher price.[172]If these transactions are done without disclosure, especially if thebeneficiaries are Tribal Council members or their relatives, it can lead to atleast a perception of conflicts of interest regarding the use of tribalresources.The complexity of managing land on reservations underscoresthe need for transparency and public disclosure. Management and ownership oftribal lands is complicated due to the fact that different lands have differentownership or trust status. Some land is the property of tribes through tribalgovernments, but held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Non-tribal landmay be interspersed with tribal lands. In some cases, tribal governments maypurchase new lands that can eventually be brought into their trust holdings. Inother cases, individuals have land title due to the Dawes Act, in force from1887 to 1934, when individual land title was granted as a means of assimilatingNative Americans and ultimately eliminating reservations. The impacts of DawesAct policies are still felt today because as individual land allotments areinherited from generation to generation, the land is divided into smaller landholdings among an increased number of descendants. This“fractionation” has resulted in land holdings so small they arevirtually worthless for use or sale. It also makes land management by thetribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs very difficult since keeping track ofthese parcels of land and administration often costs more than the land isworth.[173]The Tribal Council prioritizes buying fractionalized landfrom individuals as part of a long-term goal to restore original lands to thetribe. It also purchases other land to add to tribal holdings. The tribe cannotadd land into trust until it has been fully paid for by the tribe. In somecases, it will take a mortgage out on lands and repay it over years beforeincorporating lands into trust.[174]There is some evidence that tribal lands are leased totribal members who then lease them back to the tribe at a higher rate. Thispractice creates the perception of a conflict of interest because the TribalCouncil is the only authority that decides who may receive tribal land, canauthorize land leases to its members, and can also authorize payments to thosemembers so the government can re-lease the land. The Tribal Council does notpublicly disclose these decisions. As such, there is no oversight over thisprocess to ensure that the Tribal government does not mismanage tribal landsand lose scarce revenue.The BIA keeps records of such transactions but does notcontrol how the council awards land. This creates an inherent conflict sincethe council can authorize leases to its own council members that they in turncan re-lease at a higher price, including to the tribe itself. A governmentofficial with direct knowledge of these practices said that representatives ofthe Bureau of Indian Affairs have repeatedly and unsuccessfully urged theTribal Council to allow an independent body to oversee land allocation in orderto avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest.[175]“We’ve tried to get them to set up anindependent land committee since the current system is crooked as Hell,”said the official. “But they don’t want to do it, they want controlfor themselves.”[176]It is very difficult for tribal members to assess how suchpublic resources are allocated or whether such transactions are problematic sincethese proceedings are closed to the public and the Tribal Council resolutionsand minutes of those meetings are not made public.[177]The only public disclosure that ties individuals to particular parcels of landis the annual hunting map on the reservation. That map identifies theindividuals who allow hunting and where their parcels are located. The huntingmap does not detail how those individuals obtained the land or whether they ownit or lease it from the tribal government.[178]A government official familiar with the TribalCouncil’s allocation of land noted the opacity of these decisions.“The people don’t know [about land deals] sincethey don’t make resolutions or minutes public,” said the official.“So people don’t know when council members are giving themselvesland.”[179]The land leases detailed below exemplify the problem of howopaque land deals can fuel a perception of cronyism and are another example ofhow scarce tribal resources have been diverted at the expense of tribalmembers. The land deals were done in closed meetings and information about howpublic lands were allocated have not been made public. The availableinformation suggests that these transactions raise questions that would benefitfrom public explanation by the Tribal Council and Farm Corporation. The TribalCouncil had not responded at time of writing to requests for minutes ofmeetings or an explanation of the deals.Land Lease and Land Payment DiscrepanciesA 2008 Bureau of Indian Affairs record of land leases atLower Brule obtained by Human Rights Watch shows that members of ChairmanJandreau’s immediate family held four leases known as Bear Butte, theDorman Land Purchase, the Gilman Purchase, and Tract 1 of the Karlan Exchange.It is not clear from these records whether these individuals leased all ofthose lands or a smaller part of those tracts. The Tribal Government did notrespond to Human Rights Watch’s inquiries on this matter.According to the BIA records, the Jandreau family’sannual lease payments in 2008 were about $62,000.[180]The lessees made the lease payments to the tribe through the BIA.Tribal Government audits show that the government spent atotal of $471,856 between 2008 and 2012 to pay for the same lands that membersof Chairman Jandreau’s family leased according to 2008 BIA records.[181]It is possible that that the tribe may have re-leased land it gave to tribalmembers. In 2008 alone, the tribe spent $80,198 on those lands.[182]And in the case of the land payments identified as the Gilman Purchase, theLower Brule Farm Corporation also noted it made payments for that land in 2011and 2012 totaling $253,836.[183]The secrecy surrounding the leasing of land to individualswhile the Tribal Government pays for the same land raises questions about thepropriety of the leases even if some may be justifiable transactions. Forexample, individuals might be leasing smaller portions of land from a largerarea with the same name so payments by the Tribal Government are not related tothe leases individuals hold. For example, the Lower Brule Wildlife Departmentpays rent on lands that are similar to the tracts held by individuals and maybe part of the same tracts.[184]Since the Tribal Government does not generally disclose orexplain land transactions to the public and there is no independent body thatallocates land, it is very difficult to determine whether land deals arelegitimate or whether they may constitute a conflict of interest.[185]In the case of the Dorman Land lease, there is some evidence that the transactionmay have been an insider lease that benefited Chairman Jandreau’simmediate family. Human Rights Watch obtained the minutes of a September 2008Tribal Council meeting when the Dorman Land was allocated. In that meeting,Jandreau recused himself from the vote and seceded control of the session to Vice-ChairSandy Lacroix. Due to council rules, Lacroix was unable to vote on this matterwhile presiding as chair. The meeting minutes state that Lacroix said she wouldhave voted against allocating the land to Jandreau because it should have beensubject to an open bid. Since Jandreau and Lacroix did not vote, it passed by avote of three in favor and one abstention.[186]Opaque Land PaymentsAccording to Tribal Government annual audits, since at least2006, the Tribal Council has paid more than $1 million for unspecified landpayments to anonymous individuals without disclosing the purpose of thosepurchases or the recipients of those funds. There is no description of the typeof land purchased or the reason for those transactions. The audits do notidentify the individuals who were paid. That lack of disclosure makes it verydifficult for a tribal member or anyone else to assess whether these funds werespent appropriately.Every year, the Tribal Council budgets for land purchases,and often pays far more for land from anonymous individuals than it actuallybudgeted and does so without any clear explanation of these purchases. Onaverage, the tribe has paid approximately $150,129 a year for such purchases,primarily because of sizable payments in FY2006, FY2011, and FY2012. The annualbreakdown of payments is below:FiscalYearBudgeted($)Actual($)200632,000181,195200732,00053,665200832,00076,879200945,00035,764201030,00096,4602011100,000105,3332012500,000501,604TOTAL771,0001,050,900ANNUALAVERAGE110,142150,129Figure 1: Anonymous Individual Land Payments 2006-2012VII. WestrockThe “Westrock” deal that was announced in 2009is perhaps the largest and most blatant example of the Tribal Council secretlydiverting millions of dollars of scarce public funds intended for povertyalleviation and economic development towards extremely questionable businessactivities. The details of this deal have not been disclosed to tribal members.This disastrous investment into a failing brokerage firm helped to underminethe economic and social rights of tribal members because these public fundscould have been invested in basic services such as health, education, and othercritical assistance to the poorest people on the reservation.In this complex deal, members of the Tribal Council and theirbusiness partners set up a series of shell companies, including one underfederal rules explicitly intended to help alleviate poverty on reservations,and used them to secure a $22.5 million federal loan guarantee intended topromote economic development on the reservation. Those funds were used to buy adubious New York-based brokerage firm, Westrock Advisors. Less than two yearslater, Westrock went bankrupt.[187] Thecircumstances under which the Bureau of Indian Affairs provided the loanguarantee are under investigation by the US Department of the Interior’sOffice of Inspector General.[188]Chairman Jandreau told Bloomberg News in 2009 that theWestrock deal would “serve the members of our tribe in the areas of education,health, and employment.”[189] Thatdid not happen. According to documents, affidavits, and interviews with thosethat negotiated the deal, the Tribal Government did not have the funds to payfor Westrock and thus had to divert other scarce government resources to thispurpose. At time of writing, none of the money had been used to provide basicservices, alleviate poverty, or foster economic development at Lower Brule. Norhad the individuals involved in these transactions fully accounted for how thefunds were spent.The magnitude of this project and subsequent loss of tribaland federal funds is enormous relative to the size of the TribalGovernment’s budget. The $20 million in funds raised is equivalent toabout 63 percent of the Tribal Government’s expenditures in FY 2013, anenormous amount of money that could have generated valuable benefits to thereservation.In order to undertake this deal, the Tribal Government setup a special type of lending institution authorized under a federal program so thatit can lend money on the reservation with the ultimate goal of alleviatingpoverty and promoting economic development. The Tribal Government did not useit for this purpose. Instead, it used the institution to secure millions ofdollars in federal funds that were used for questionable and opaque businessdeals that did not involve lending on the reservation. Ultimately, scarcetribal funds and proceeds of a federal loan guarantee were used to pay some ofWestrock’s investors and business partners, including some Tribal Councilmembers.[190]The deal originated with the desire of Tribal Councilmembers to start a special type of tribally-owned company that is exempt fromfederal taxes in order to promote Native American economic development.[191]But council members and their business partners wanted to take the unprecedentedstep of structuring the company as a private equity firm or holding companybecause they believed it would allow them to sell shares in the company toattract private capital.[192] Thisnew company would be called the Lower Brule Corporation (LBC) and it receivedfederal approval in April 2007.[193]The idea was billed as an almost risk and cost-free path toprosperity.[194]Investors would enjoy tax-free profits on their investments due tocompany’s special federal status, while investors’ money wouldallow the tribal corporation to make multimillion-dollar acquisitions of other companieswithout committing tribal funds.[195]In 2007, a business consultant for the tribe met representativesof Westrock Advisors, a New York based brokerage firm.[196]In business since 1995, Westrock claimed to have $1.4 billion in assets under managementand 150 employees.[197] Throughout2007 and 2008, LBC and Westrock negotiated the firm’s purchase. Ifcompleted, it would be the first wholly Native American-owned brokerage firm inUS history.As alluring as the deal was, it was also risky for a small,rural tribe with limited financial resources and no Wall Street experience. Andby trying to constitute the venture as an investment firm that would enjoytax-free status, it was also an unprecedented use of a tribal company, and thusinherently risky to prospective investors. It was also unclear whether it waslegal, since selling shares would dilute the ownership of the company, whichthe law said must be wholly owned by the tribe.Ultimately, the legality of such a venture would likelyhinge on the views of the IRS.[198]Moreover, the scheme completely relied on outside investment since the tribelacked the money and expertise for such a venture.[199]In 2007, when the Westrock project was first proposed, the tribe had a morethan $10 million deficit with expenses of about $41 million.[200]Other factors made the deal even riskier and should have been fully apparent toChairman Jandreau and other LBC board members after even a cursory duediligence process during the period from when they first began to negotiatewith Westrock in 2007 to the time that they publicly announced the purchase in2009. Some of these risk factors included:The period of negotiations coincided withthe start of a global economic crisis and the worst US financial crisis sincethe Great Depression.Westrock’s near financial insolvencyfor years. Westrock made an annual profit only twice from 2003-2008, years inwhich it lost about $2.36 million.[201]Westrock’s serious accounting errorsthat forced it to restate its accounts in 2008 because it did not meet the$50,000 minimum capital reserves the US Securities and Exchange Commissionrequire for brokerage firms. By the end of 2008, Westrock reported $143,047 incapital reserves, but really had negative reserves of $6,440.[202]Repeated sanction by government and industryregulators for dubious practices. Between 2005 and 2008, the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers (NASD), an industry regulatory body, and itssuccessor, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), cited andsanctioned Westrock for at least 12 serious violations of industry rules.[203]Fines in 2008 by Connecticut’sDepartment of Banking, which barred it from certain types of state businessafter determining that Westrock repeatedly “engaged in dishonest orunethical business practices.”[204] Alabama’s StateSecurities Commission started investigating the company in 2007 overallegations it illegally traded in securities as an unlicensed broker. Alabamastate regulators had refused a Westrock a license since 2001, partly due topast transgressions.[205]Westrock made about $130,000 in 2008 andlost $570,000 in 2009, nowhere near the profits claimed.[206] Inaddition, the company had at least $5 million in other debts, missed interestpayments to investors, and had defaulted on promissory notes it had sold in2007 and 2008.[207]Arbitration proceedings against Westrockthat FINRA initiated in February and October 2008 because it had engaged in“fraudulent activity” and other transgressions when it soldproducts to unsuspecting customers. FINRA ultimately fined and sanctioned thecompany for those activities.[208]A ban dating from September 2009 by theAlabama State Securities Commission that permanently barred Westrock fromselling securities. Since 2001, the commission had repeatedly denied Westrock alicense to do so because it was concerned about past problems with the company,which continued to sell securities illegally.[209]Despite those factors, the tribe offered to buy Westrock, afirm on the brink of insolvency, for about $17.5 million in February 2008.[210]Neither Westrock nor the tribe had cash to finalize the purchase.[211]By March 2009, the deal still had not been finalized due to the lack of funds.As a result, the tribal company was also negotiating a loan guarantee from theUS Bureau of Indian Affairs under a program intended to help promote economicdevelopment for individual Native Americans and tribes.[212]Without financing, the tribe’s company and Westrock agreed to a papertransaction in which Westrock’s shareholders (largely the principals ofthe company) would “sell” their shares to a subsidiary of thetribe’s company known as LBC Western, Inc. (LBC Western) in exchange forpromissory notes from LBC Western.[213] LBCWestern would repay the notes later with cash to finalize the purchase.Although Westrock’s precarious state rendered it ahighly questionable investment before, during, and after the tribe’spurchase, Chairman Jandreau repeatedly said that the tribe had doneconsiderable due diligence before buying the company.[214]Click to expand Image© AP Images for Westrock Group,2009On September 9, 2009, members of the Tribal Council and principalsof Westrock announced that the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe bought the WestrockGroup through its shell company, LBC Western Holdings, making Westrock thefirst 100 percent Native-owned financial services group in the US. The board ofdirectors for Westrock was a mix of Tribal Council members and Westrockexecutives. The board included Michael Jandreau, John McCauley, and DarrellMiddletent from the Tribal Council. Anthony Fenton, the chairman ofWestrock’s board, and Donald Hunter, its president and chief executive officer,were the company’s representatives on the board.[215]“We believe that Westrock will make a powerfulcontribution to the lives of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe,” Hunter said.[216]But the actual terms of the deal were not disclosed.[217]Gayle Ziegler, then a Tribal Council member, told Human Rights Watch she wasunaware that the deal was being finalized.[218]The actual terms of the purchase were the same as before:LBC Western acquired all of the shares in the company in exchange forpromissory notes. No cash was paid, but some shareholders expected to get paidafter a Bureau of Interior loan guarantee was finalized.[219]Shell CompaniesIt was not a simple purchase. To complete the deal, the tribecreated a series of subsidiary shell companies to the Lower Brule Corporation(LBC) that would be used as holding companies and to finance the purchase ofWestrock. One of these companies was started to finance the purchase and wasknown as the Lower Brule Community Development Enterprise (LBCDE).LBCDE’s stated mission was to alleviate poverty and promote economic developmenton the reservation. In reality, its main purpose was to obtain special taxcredits from the US government, as well as a loan guarantee to provide arisk-free loan to another of the tribe’s shell companies that would beused to buy Westrock.[220]LBC Western and the other companies were essentially shellcompanies registered in Delaware between April 17 and April 22, 2008.[221]All were subsidiaries of the tribe’s main company, LBC.[222]It is not clear why LBC chose to form the companies this way. The structuremeant that LBC Western, Inc. would be the purchaser of Westrock and issue thepromissory notes for the Westrock stock while the rest served as intermediaryshell companies.Lower Brule Community Development Enterprise (LBCDE)One of the most problematic aspects of the Westrock deal wasthe formation and use of the Lower Brule Community Development Enterprise(LBCDE). LBCDE was created under federal rules that authorize federal fundingto specialized financial institutions to enable lending to people in thepoorest communities throughout the US, such as some Indian reservations ordistressed areas in cities. Instead of doing that, members of the TribalCouncil and their business partners set LBCDE up as a shell company in order tosecure federal funds, but not necessarily to alleviate poverty, despite itsmandate to do so.The principals of LBC hired Dr. Gavin Clarkson, a Choctawtribe member and academic who specializes in tribal finance to secure the loanguarantee and undertake other business on their behalf, such as securing aspecial type of federal tax credits.[223]He and the tribe decided to start a Native CommunityDevelopment Financial Institution and a Community Development Entity.[224]Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Community DevelopmentEntities (CDEs) were established under a 1994 law to promote economicdevelopment and alleviate poverty in poor communities. The US TreasuryDepartment certifies CDFIs, which have a mandate to promote economicdevelopment by supporting businesses, job creation, affordable housing, basicbanking services, financial literacy, and alternatives to predatory lending.[225]Native CDFIs are a subset of these institutions. Their focus is “toincrease the access to credit, capital, and financial services in NativeCommunities by creating and expanding CDFIs primarily serving NativeCommunities.”[226]The day the tribe announced it was buying Westrock, theboard of the Lower Brule Corporation (LBC) formed their CDFI, known as theLower Brule Community Development Enterprise (LBCDE), a for-profit Native CDFIand a subsidiary of LBC, the tribe’s tax-exempt company.[227]On September 10, LBCDE was formally incorporated in Delaware as a shell company,with a president (Gavin Clarkson) based in New Mexico.[228]On October 3, 2009, the US Department of Treasury formally certified LBCDE.[229]Treasury certification is mandatory for such an institution, but is largely a“pro-forma” process.[230]This structure was very unusual for a Native CDFI,especially for one on a reservation in South Dakota, because LBCDE has nophysical presence, no discernible staff, does not lend money to tribal members,has no website, and does not produce annual reports or other documentationshowing that it operates at Lower Brule.[231]Even though it did not engage in actual lending activity onthe reservation, the Tribal Council transferred $100,000 in cash and $929,000in mostly non-performing small loans from a tribally-run small loans program toLBCDE to show on paper that it did lend.[232]The tribe’s annual federal audits did not reflect thetransfers, even though they were substantial and the Tribal Government (notLBCDE) still reports that it operates the loan programs from which the fundswere apparently transferred.[233] A NewYork state judge in a Westrock-related lawsuit against LBCDE later describedits activities as “murky.”[234]In contrast, the other three Native CDFIs on South Dakota reservationsthat provide financial services in some of the poorest places in the US have aphysical presence, staff, are well-known nationally, and lend to individualsand small businesses on their reservations. They also have websites, publishannual reports about the types and amounts of their lending, and are public andtransparent about their activities.[235]Towards InsolvencyBy mid-2010, Westrock was rapidly headed towards insolvencyand it became increasingly clear that LBCDE’s activities were not goingto alleviate poverty at Lower Brule. Despite this, Gavin Clarkson said thatTribal Council members in charge of the deal asked him to save Westrock.“Basically I was tasked with building alifeboat,” he said. “I came aboard the Titanic after the iceberghad hit.”[236]On behalf of LBCDE, Clarkson obtained the $22.5 million loanguarantee from the Bureau of Indian Affairs by mid-2010 to allow the LBCDE toloan the money to its sister company in order to pay for the Westrock purchase,and inject new capital into the company.[237] LBCDEintended to sell the guaranteed part of the loan to another bank for cash, acommon practice for loans generally, but more difficult for BIA loanguarantees.[238]Those plans fell apart in the fall of 2010. Westrock Grouphad effectively stopped doing business and owed more than $9.6 million toinvestors and other creditors.[239] Theboard of LBCDE then authorized Clarkson to “lend” the money to itssister company, LBC Western, for the purchase of the insolvent Westrock in apaper transaction by December 2010. Then they authorized Clarkson to sell thefederally guaranteed part of the loan for cash.[240]“My goal was to find a guarantee and have some third partybank take over the guarantee,” Clarkson said. “LBCDE didn’thave money. We didn’t have the money to make a $22.5 million loan.”[241]Westrock and the tribe tried to keep the company solventwhile awaiting cash from the loan guarantee, so they approached investors whoalready lost their money in Westrock and made them a new offer sometime in thesecond half of 2010: settle for pennies on the dollar or invest new funds intothe company with a promise the full investment would be repaid with the fundsobtained after LBCDE sold the federal loan guarantee for cash.[242]Clarkson said:[W]e went back to the existing investors and said,‘Look, everything is dead, you’ve lost all your money…. Theonly way you’re going to get any money rescued is if we put new money in,but it will be a 100 percent protected by the BIA guarantee.’ So weraised $3.5 million…. For the people who put in money—we were ableto give them 100 percent protection, not only of their new investment, but tohelp them protect part of their old investment as well…. We said ‘Iknow this is going to sound weird but we need you to throw good money after badto make your bad money good.’[243]In effect, the solution to bail out Westrock and pay backinvestors was to have one of the tribe’s shell companies obtain aneconomic development loan guarantee from the US government, then lend thatguaranteed money to another tribal shell company in a paper transaction tofinance the purchase of an insolvent brokerage. Then they would sell theguaranteed loan for cash to a third party, and use the new cash to try to keepWestrock solvent, pay investors, and perhaps profit.Charles Ireland III, from Birmingham, Alabama, was one ofthe people Clarkson called to reinvest in the venture. He is in his 60s and saidhe was an heir to the Vulcan Materials construction company fortune.[244]An accredited investor under SEC rules, Ireland lost more than $70,000 toWestrock.[245]Around August 2010, he said Clarkson called him and askedhim to reinvest in the company, telling him he could rollover the amount of hislost investment into the new one, or do that and add new matching funds. If hedid the latter, his money would be guaranteed.[246]Ireland said Clarkson told him by phone the new investment would be more securethan prior ones because of the federal loan guarantee. Although the offer was“pretty damn attractive,” Ireland said he was skeptical. A lawyeradvised him not to commit new money before recovering his prior investment, whichhe ultimately wrote off.[247]Selling the part of the loan covered by the federal loanguarantee would make the US government, not the tribal companies, responsiblefor repaying the loan if the tribe’s company defaulted on it. The USgovernment had effectively guaranteed a toxic loan since the tribe had no moneyand the transaction’s only asset, Westrock, was likely to be insolvent.But if the tribe sold the loan, it would get millions in cash while the US governmentwould ultimately be responsible for repaying it. It is not clear why the Bureauof Indian Affairs would guarantee such a loan in these circumstances, and thebureau did not respond to Human Rights Watch’s repeated requests forinformation. It is now precluded from responding due to an officialinvestigation into the awarding of that loan guarantee.[248]Westrock went out of business in January 2011 after theState of Connecticut revoked one of its subsidiaries’ licenses to operateand levied a $250,000 fine against it for illegally selling securities.[249]The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the industry body thatregulates and licenses individual brokers and firms, then expelled it,effectively forcing it to stop operating as a licensed broker for failing topay prior fines the same month.[250] WestrockGroup, a subsidiary, declared chapter 7 bankruptcy for complete liquidation onSeptember 6, 2012, almost exactly three years after the tribe bought it.Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries still exist.[251]Even though Westrock was effectively insolvent, Clarksonsold the loan guarantee for approximately $20 million in April 2012 to theGreat American Insurance Group, an Ohio-based subsidiary of the multibillion dollarAmerican Financial Group.[252] Morethan a year after Westrock stopped doing business and five months before itformally declared bankruptcy, the tribe’s business obtained millions ofdollars by selling a federal loan guarantee meant to promote economicdevelopment and alleviate poverty.Clarkson acknowledged that the third party bank wasbasically dealing with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for repayment instead ofthe tribe or its businesses after he sold the loan.[253]He said that money from the sale of the loan guarantee wasused to pay back all investors, towards whom the tribe felt responsibility.[254]But according to court documents and interviews, only some preferred investorswho held notes in the failed Westrock transaction were repaid. Others, includingthose who lost their life’s savings and did not fully consent to reinvest,got nothing.[255]Personal ProfitThere is evidence that suggests Tribal Council members mayhave personally profited, along with Clarkson and others involved in the deal,despite claims to the contrary.[256]Clarkson, for example, initially told Human Rights Watchthat he did not receive any “commissions” for his work with LBCDEand later said he received “no compensation whatsoever” from thisdeal.[257]However, Judge Eileen Bransten concluded in a related lawsuit against LBCDE inNew York state courts that he and his company received more than $300,000 incompensation.[258] WhenHuman Rights Watch asked Clarkson about this discrepancy, he said that he stoodby his initial statement that he did not receive any commissions for his work.[259]Clarkson’s compensation was more than 300 percent higher than thesalaries of the heads of larger, more established Native CDFIs.[260]According to Judge Bransten’s ruling, LBCDE paid $366,764in fees and other payments.[261] It isnot clear who received this compensation or for what purpose.There is evidence from Judge Bransten’s ruling andother official documents that suggests Tribal Council members who served on theLBCDE’s board may have personally enriched themselves by obtaining freeshares in the company and then paying themselves using the proceeds of the saleof the federal loan guarantee.Judge Bransten concluded that LBCDE used more than $12million of the cash from the sale of the guaranteed loan to pay some of thepreferred company shareholders including for shares “held by members ofLBCDE’s board.”[262] At thetime, LBCDE’s board consisted of seven people, five of whom were alsoTribal Council members. Three of these individuals still serve on the Tribal Councilat time of writing.[263]As noted, the tribe did not pay cash for Westrock and thereis no evidence that board members of LBCDE or other tribal entities paid forWestrock shares. This raises the question of whether LBCDE board members whoalso served on the Tribal Council received cash for the shares they awardedthemselves for free to their own personal benefit but to the detriment of publiccoffers, impoverished tribal members who were the intended beneficiaries of thefederal loan program, and the unprivileged shareholders of Westrock whoultimately lost their investment.Since LBCDE’s finances are not publicly disclosed, itis difficult to determine what funds it has other than the money it receivedfrom the sale of the federal loan guarantee. LBCDE may have receivedcommissions of approximately $500,000 from its participation in a federal NewMarkets Tax Credit Program.[264] LBCDEalso lent the Tribal Government about $800,000 to avert an emergency default ondebt.[265] It isnot clear whether those funds have been repaid. The total amount of LBCDE’sknown expenditures is approximately $13.5 million, leaving at least $6.5million of the proceeds from the sale of the federally guaranteed loanremaining.On May 21, 2014, LBCDE reported that it had offered $6.8million in shares in LBCDE in exchange for shares in Westrock held by someinvestors, according to a filing with the US Securities and ExchangeCommission. However, it did not explain how these shares would be worth $6.8million since LBCDE has not disclosed its finances or assets. It has also notdisclosed which investors received these shares.[266]At time of writing, current and former Tribal Council membersinvolved in this transaction because they were also principals of LBCDE had notresponded to Human Rights Watch inquiries about the funds they received fromselling the guaranteed portion of the loan for about $20 million.No Benefit to the ReservationMillions of dollars have been spent since at least 2009, butnone have benefited people on the reservation even though the publicjustification of this deal was to promote economic development and alleviatepoverty at Lower Brule, or in effect, to help realize tribal members’economic and social rights. Judge Bransten said in a ruling in the New Yorkstate lawsuit against LBCDE that there was “no proof” that moneyhad made it back to the tribe.[267]Human Rights Watch has repeatedly and unsuccessfully triedto find the IRS ruling that authorized this venture for the TribalGovernment’s company. Nor has it found any ruling reversing it. By law,the IRS must make such rulings public so it is not clear whether the IRS everformally endorsed it since we could not locate any such determination.[268]Human Rights Watch contacted the IRS by phone and email on several occasions,but had not received a response at time of writing.[269]It is also not clear whether LBC Western has defaulted onthe loan. If LBC Western defaulted on the loan the US government would beforced to pay it. LBC Western’s only asset was the Westrock Group and itssubsidiaries, and it is not clear how it could repay LBCDE or Great AmericanInsurance. However, since the US government guaranteed the loan, Great AmericanInsurance will get its money from US taxpayers if the loan defaults.[270]Neither Clarkson nor the Tribal Government would comment on whether LBC Westernhad defaulted on its loan.[271]Lack of AnswersOther than the disclosure of the loan from LBCDE to the tribein the 2012 audit, Tribal Government audits have never disclosed the existence ofthe Lower Brule Corporation, LBC Western, Westrock, or LBCDE, even though theLower Brule Corporation was formed in 2007 and almost $1 million in TribalGovernment loans were transferred to LBCDE in 2009. To the knowledge of HumanRights Watch, the Tribal Government has never released specific audits of LBC,LBC Western, or LBCDE. Human Rights Watch requested the 2013 audit from theBureau of Indian Affairs through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request buthas not yet received it. Tribal audits through 2012 have also not accounted formore than $1 million in transactions between the tribe and LBCDE that were acombination of cash transactions and the transfer of unidentifiednon-performing loans. Information about the venture only became known once Westrock’spurchase was announced publicly and the company went bankrupt.[272]The Department of Interior’s Office of InspectorGeneral is now investigating this case because the Bureau of Indian Affairsissued the loan guarantee.[273] Attime of writing, Human Rights Watch had not received a response to requests tomeet with officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs about the Westrock deal.Human Rights Watch also filed a FOIA request ondocumentation related to the loan guarantee and Westrock. On September 30,2013, the Department of Interior informed Human Rights Watch that they couldnot provide any documentation related to the loan guarantee because the Officeof the Inspector General had initiated an investigation into it. Federal law thereforeprohibits disclosure of documents that are subject to a current investigation.[274]Westrock VictimsTribal members were not the only victims of the TribalGovernment’s business activities. Unsuspecting investors in Westrocksuffered too. The company repeatedly sold questionable notes in the company inan attempt to raise cash. In many cases, it meant that these investors wouldunwittingly lose key funds that made it very difficult for them to meet theirbasic needs.For example, according to FINRA’s consent decreeagainst Donald Hunter, the former president of Westrock, the company sold morethan $4.1 million in such notes between March 2009 and September 2010 toinvestors who should not have been solicited under US Securities and ExchangeCommission rules because the investments were so risky.[275]Nonetheless, Westrock sold them to unsuspecting investors and those activitiesultimately led to sanctions against some of the company’s staff.[276]According to documents from enforcement and disciplinaryactions by FINRA, Westrock representatives deceived investors, falsely tellingthem that Westrock notes were safe investments with high returns. In fact, theinvestment was so risky that they were only supposed to be sold to“accredited investors,” or those who could afford such risks. UnderSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, individual accredited investorsshould have had at least $1 million in net worth or should have consistentlyearned at least $200,000 a year.[277]However, Westrock sold at least hundreds of thousands ofdollars’ worth of notes to dozens of people who clearly did not meetthose standards. In some cases, these were people who wanted to invest theirlife’s savings safely, who did not want to make high risk investments,and who would not be able to recover from those losses according to FINRA.[278]In one case, Westrock sold a retiree $100,000 in notes when she was seeking asafe investment for her child’s college education even though she had anannual income of just $10,000.[279]The deceptive sale of these notes was so egregious that in2012, FINRA permanently banned Donald Hunter, then-president and CEO ofWestrock, from selling securities or working at any firm that sells securities.[280]At least five other brokers have been suspended and fined for selling thesenotes to unsuspecting investors.[281] ToHuman Rights Watch’s knowledge, no one working at Westrock has facedcriminal charges for these activities.[282]Clarkson and other members of Westrock approached some ofthese same investors to provide more funds to the company with the promise thatthey would recoup their investments because the federal government guaranteedit.[283]Human Rights Watch spoke to two people who were listed as someof the largest individual creditors to Westrock in its bankruptcy filings. Theyhad not consented to these investments, but had lost their life’s savingsdue to them. Human Rights Watch also spoke to the son of a deceased investorwho was owed more than $100,000 from Westrock and the tribe. They all said thatthey were sold the questionable notes. Only one has received any money for thelost investment (less than 25 percent of the loss). All were asked to reinvestfor a greater return by tribal or Westrock representatives, but refused. Thosewho had lost life savings were skeptical and did not have the money to reinvest.Some also received legal advice to avoid the investment because it seemedquestionable. All were suspicious of the deal after losing prior investmentswith Westrock.[284]AcknowledgmentsThis report was researched and written by Arvind Ganesan,director of the Business and Human Rights Division at Human Rights Watch.

Professor Schusky, who lived at Lower Brule and is theauthor of the only history of the tribe and reservation, attributed it partlyto the understandable hostility towards the federal government; suspicion ofnew government programs due to the repeated failures of past ones; and also partlyto the Tribal Council’s belief that the federal government’s systemof limited sovereignty had not led to economic development or improved socialconditions on the reservation. By pursuing termination and freeing itself fromthe federal government, Schusky concluded that the Tribal Government thought itmight have more opportunities to succeed and reconstitute itself as acommunity. Schusky noted, however, that tribal members did not overwhelminglysupport termination.[14]President Lyndon B.

Whether it is to declare a public holiday, change salariesof tribal employees or the Tribal Council, enact new criminal laws, or allocatetribal land or other resources to individuals, an ordinance or resolution ishow those decisions come into force. Ordinances are meant for permanentdecisions, such as criminal laws, and resolutions are used for temporarymeasures, such as an annual budget, an order to spend tribal funds, or periodicor recurring measures.[60]Former Tribal Council members Gayle Ziegler, Alfred “Sonny”Ziegler, Ben Thompson, and a fourth former council member reported this inseparate interviews with Human Rights Watch.[61]Jesse Abernathy, “Michael Jandreau Leads Tribe for 33 Years,” NativeSun News, February 2, 2012, http://www.indianz.com/News/2012/004463.asp(accessed February 10, 2014).[62]Numerous interviews between December 2012 and July 2013 with tribal membersconfirmed these relationships.[63]The $81,000 salary estimate is generallyconsistent with compensation of other public servants around the US.

OMB Circular A-133 are the guidelines that entitiessuch as tribal governments must follow when being audited for the use offederal funds.[91]That audit is known as the “combined federal audit.” The US Officeof Management and Budget also refers to it as the A-133 audit, or the“single audit” because a single audit is supposed to monitor theuse of federal and other funds, even when they are from different governmentagencies. The single audit makes the auditing process more efficient,cost-effective, and provides perhaps the most comprehensive view of the TribalGovernment’s financial activities, including those of some of its relatedbusinesses, and any shortcomings in accounting for funds.[92]Cobell v. Salazar was a large class-action suit brought by NativeAmericans against the US government because of the mismanagement of Nativelands and resources held in trust by the US government.

TheTribal Government generally, and Chairman Jandreau in particular, have toutedthe success of their farming operations and have claimed that they are thelargest popcorn producer in the United States. Perhaps the most publicizedtribal venture currently is Lakota Foods, a subsidiary of the farm corporation.It is the first Native American-owned business set up to process, package, andsell popcorn and has been the subject of several favorable media stories. Whilethe Farm Corporation is profitable, it is indebted and its financial health isimperiled by other business ventures and the need to help fund the tribe.Lakota Foods, for example, is unprofitable and its finances are opaque.According to its 2011 and 2012 audits, it lost about $148,000 and $383,000,respectively. The Washington Post newspaper reported that the WashingtonRedskins football team planned to sell its popcorn at its stadium, in part as aresponse to widespread pressure to change the controversial name of the team.

The government never received an audit as favorable as the 2007audit. All subsequent audits revealed serious financial management problemswithin the Tribal Government.[100]Human Rights Watch has obtained copies of Tribal Government audits from FiscalYears 2006 to 2012. In those audit reports, Eide Bailly defined a“material weakness” as a “significant deficiency, or acombination of significant deficiencies, that results in a more than remotelikelihood that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement ofa federal program will not be detected or prevented by the entity’sinternal control.” That definition, while specific to compliance withrules regarding the use of federal funds, is consistent with the generallyaccepted definition of a material weakness as promulgated by the US Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC considers a material weakness to be aserious breach in financial management because it can contribute to fraud orinaccurate assessments of an entity’s financial health. The SEC definesit as “a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controlover financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that amaterial misstatement of the registrant’s annual or interim financialstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.” See USSecurities and Exchange Commission, “Final Rule, Definition of the TermSignificant Deficiency,” September 10, 2007,http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2007/33-8829.pdf (accessed September 25, 2014).[101]Eide Bailly, “Financial Statements, September 30, 2008, Lower Brule SiouxTribe,” September 18, 2009, on file with Human Rights Watch, p.64.[102]For example, the US Department of Interior’s Bureau of Reclamationrequested an explanation and ultimately repayment of funds because of adiversion of funds revealed through one of the audits. That case is detailedbelow in section V. Mismanagement of Public Funds.[103]Eide Bailly, “Financial Statements, September 30, 2008, Lower Brule SiouxTribe,” September 18, 2009, on file with Human Rights Watch, p. 64. Specifically,the audit said: “Management [the Tribal Government] concurs with thefinding. The Tribe has entered into a repayment plan with the Bureau ofReclamation to reduce the dollar amount of funds included in the Tribe’spooled checking account. It is expected that the full amount will be repaidwithin the current period.”[104]Eide Bailly, “Financial Statements, September 30, 2009, Lower Brule SiouxTribe,” June 30, 2010, on file with Human Rights Watch, pp. 63-73.[105]Eide Bailly, “Financial Statements, September 30, 2010, Lower Brule SiouxTribe,” May 31, 2011, on file with Human Rights Watch, pp. 62-73.[106]Eide Bailly, “Financial Statements, September 30, 2011, Lower Brule SiouxTribe,” June 21, 2012, on file with Human Rights Watch, p. 70.[107]Ibid., pp. 65-73.[108]Eide Bailly, “Financial Statements, September 30, 2012, Lower Brule SiouxTribe,” June 27, 2013, on file with Human Rights Watch, pp. 67-75.[109]See Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638of 1975, http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/mywcsp/documents/collection/idc017333.pdf(accessed December 22, 2014); Indian Self Determination and EducationAssistance Act, Public Law 93-638 of 1975, Regulations,http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/mywcsp/documents/collection/idc017334.pdf(accessed December 22, 2014).[110]See for example, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act,1975.[111]“Letter of Grave Concern from Michael R.

Erdahl said, “Yes, ifyou deposit a repayment of at least $25,000 per month into the rural watersavings account, you can pay 100% of the o&m [operations and management]out of that account. LBST [the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe] can deposit more than$25,000 if they are able and wish to have the balance repaid sooner.”[138]The two programs where funds were diverted were the Department ofInterior’s Indian School Equalization Program which provides funding totribal governments to operate their K-12 schools; and for the Indian EducationsFacilities Operations and Maintenance program to fund the upkeep of schoolinfrastructure.
