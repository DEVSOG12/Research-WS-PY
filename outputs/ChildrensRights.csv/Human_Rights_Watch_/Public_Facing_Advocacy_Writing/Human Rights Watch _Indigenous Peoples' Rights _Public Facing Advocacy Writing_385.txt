In Todd County, South Dakota, where the Rosebud IHS Hospital is located, the average life expectancy is 67 years – more than a full decade below the national average.With the nearest alternative hospital about 50 miles away, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe sued the US government to reopen the emergency wing and properly staff the hospital. The suit also asked the court to declare that the federal government was failing to fulfill its treaty and statutory obligations to provide adequate health care to the members of the tribe.The government reopened the hospital’s emergency department in 2016. But four years later, the court ruled on the plaintiffs’ other claims by defining the government’s legal obligations to the tribe under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which established the Great Sioux Reservation, part of the long record of systemic violence and oppression by white settlers and the US government against Indigenous people. The court found that according to the treaty, the US government had an obligation to provide “competent physician-led healthcare to the Tribe’s members.”The Eighth Circuit’s ruling last week upheld this district court’s order, but held that its analysis only applies to this specific treaty and case. Still, it sets an important precedent for chronically mismanaged and inadequate health services that have plagued AIAN communities for years.International human rights law affirms the rights of members of AIAN communities to equal and timely access to basic health services, and requires governments to eliminate structural racial and ethnic discrimination. The US government should start making good on its commitments and fulfill these rights for the people of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and for members of all AIAN communities.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicHealth Health Care AccessMore ReadingAugust 19, 2021DispatchesGlobal Covid-19 Vaccine Equity Should Get a ‘Booster’ TooMay 6, 2021DispatchesClimate Crisis A Rising Threat to Maternal Health in the USReportsApril 12, 2022Report“If I’m Out of Insulin, I’m Going to Die”United States’ Lack of Regulation Fuels Crisis of Unaffordable InsulinJanuary 20, 2022Report“We Need Access”Ending Preventable Deaths from Cervical Cancer in Rural GeorgiaMore ReadingAugust 19, 2021DispatchesGlobal Covid-19 Vaccine Equity Should Get a ‘Booster’ TooMay 6, 2021DispatchesClimate Crisis A Rising Threat to Maternal Health in the USMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
