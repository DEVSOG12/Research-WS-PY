But the scale and complexity of the problem is no excuse for tolerating a practice that traps children in multi-generational cycles of poverty, or, worse, leaves them injured, maimed, or dead.It's critically important for Mexico, which recently raised its minimum working age, to better enforce its laws and apply substantial penalties to growers who violate it.Simply firing children causes substantial harm to families who can least bear the cost. To minimize this, there should be government assistance available to these families, and growers who illegally employ children should be forced to contribute to these payments.Government programs such as cash transfers, in which poor families receive small payments conditional on school attendance, also have a proven track record of decreasing child labor and increasing school enrollment. Improving access to education is critical: In the state of Guerrero's Mixteco areas, for example, some communities have no schools at all, and in others, schools stop short of a full primary education. Education programs for migrant children are similarly limited.Addressing other factors that push children to work, including low wages for parents and insufficient child care, also can significantly reduce child labor.Unfortunately, one place Mexico can't look for examples is the U.S., which excludes child farmworkers from most child labor protections. Given both governments' poor track records, retailers and other major buyers of agricultural products must conduct their own monitoring and training throughout their supply chain to ensure that their vegetables aren't harvested by endangered and exploited children.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAmericas Mexico United States US Poverty and Economic InequalityTopicEconomic Justice and Rights Children's Rights Child Labor Poverty and InequalityMore ReadingJune 3, 2020CommentaryBrazil Suffers its Own Scourge of Police BrutalityMay 11, 2020CommentaryIn the Pandemic, Millions of People Could Lose Their HomesReportsFebruary 20, 2018Report“Set up to Fail”The Impact of Offender-Funded Private Probation on the PoorJuly 12, 2017ReportNeglected and UnprotectedThe Impact of the Zika Outbreak on Women and Girls in Northeastern BrazilMore ReadingJune 3, 2020CommentaryBrazil Suffers its Own Scourge of Police BrutalityMay 11, 2020CommentaryIn the Pandemic, Millions of People Could Lose Their HomesMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
