UNITED ST ATES OF A MERICA:   
Compliance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
 
Submission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child  
from the US Campaign to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers1 
 
November 2007 
 
 
Summary  of key issue s of concern 
 
The US Armed Forces h ave adopted policie s since 2002 designed to 
prevent the participation  of 17-year  old US volunteers in ar med conflict . 
However, information supplied by the Departme nt of Defense shows tha t 
despite su ch policie s, approximatel y 60 17-year old troops were deployed to 
Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 and 20 04. Although corrective measures were 
taken, it i s not clear if such deployment may ha ve recurred si nce that time, 
and whether policie s pro hibiting the deployment of 17-year olds are 
effectively enforced. 
 
US govern ment reports documenting misc ondu ct by military recruiters r aise 
concerns re garding the US’ obligati ons to ensur e that recruit ment of chil dren 
into the armed forces i s genuinely voluntary, and done with full and infor med 
consent. Do cumented misconduct by military recruiters has included the u se 
of deception , coercion, f alsification o f documents, and sexual harassment.  
US laws allowing military recruiters to  obtain stud ents’ person al information 
and contact information from secondary schools,  also raise  concerns 
regarding st udents’ right  to privacy. 
 
The US has detained hu ndreds of ch ildren suspe cted of activi ty with arme d 
groups in Ira q, and has a lso detained  children at its facil ities a t 
Guantanamo, Cuba. In many of the se case s, the US govern ment has not 
recognized t he juvenile status of these detainees,  applied inte rnational 
juvenile justi ce standard s, or recogni zed their rig ht to rehabili tation and 
reintegration . 
 
Under existing US law, the US gov ernment has opposed asyl um claims 
from former child so ldiers from other countries o n the grounds that they 
participated in the perse cution of oth ers. Former child so ldiers seekin g 
asylum or re fugee status also face obstacles because of laws barring such 
status to ind ividuals who have provid ed support t o groups en gaging in 
terrorist activity.

 1Article 1: Direct participation of soldi ers under the age of 18 in armed conflict  
 
The US government states that appr oximat ely 1 500 soldiers each year are still 17 wh en 
they complete their basi c training an d are ready for operatio nal assignm ent.2 As of April 
2007, the Army had approximately 9 50 active-duty soldiers u nder the age of 18, the 
Marine Corp s had 310, t he Navy had 70, and th e Air Force had 85.3 
 
In 2003, each US armed  service ado pted an implementation plan regardi ng the 
deployment of 17-year old soldiers in order to f ulfill the US’ ob ligations u nder article 1 of 
the Optional Protocol.  
 
The US Army policy, issued in Janu ary 2003, is to not assig n or deploy soldiers ou tside 
the continen tal US, Puerto Rico or te rritories or p ossessions of the United States unti l 
they have attained the a ge of 18 years.4  
 
The US Navy assignment policy, issued on 28 F ebruary 2003, stipulate s that “At no time 
will an enli sted member under the age of 18 be i ssued order that require reporting to an 
operational command,” i ncluding in  a commissioned vessel or deployable squadron.5 In 
April 2007, t he Navy added a furthe r review on final orders f or sailors un der age 18 t o 
ensure they were not being ordered to an operati onal unit.6 
 
Initial guid ance sent to Marine Corp s command ers in Janua ry 2003 did not preclude  
deployment of 17 year olds in overse as operation s, and instru cted commanders to 
“weigh the mission req uirements against the pr acticabi lity of diverting 17-year old 
Marines from combat.” However, o n April 22, 2 007, the Marine Corps i ssued a ne w 
policy, statin g that effecti ve immediately, Marines younger than 18 years of age were 
prohibited fr om being operationally deployed. Commanding g enerals and commandin g 
officers wer e responsibl e for ensurin g the policy was implemented.7  
 
The Air Force policy is n ot to assign airmen who have not reached their ei ghteenth 
birthdate to hostile fire  or imminent d anger zones.8 
 
In 2004, the Director of Military Personnel Policy for the US Army acknowledged in a 
letter to Human Rights Watch that nearly  60 17-year old US soldiers h ad been depl oyed 
to Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004.9 The Department of Defense subsequently 
stated that “t he situation s were immediately rect ified and act ion taken to prevent 
recurrence.”10 Human Rig hts Watch sent a written request in April 2007 a nd again in 
August 2007 for update d information regarding possible d eployment of 17-year old US 
troops to Ira q or Afghanistan, but as of Nove mber 2007, had not received a response.

 2Given the d eployment o f 17-year olds to confl ict situation s in 2003 and 20 04, we rema in 
concerned r egarding whether the pol icies of the US armed forces again st such 
deployments are being effect ively implemented .  
 
Questions for the US g overnment:  
1) Have any 1 7-year old US troops ser ved in Iraq or Afghanista n in 2005, 2 006 or 
2007? If so, how man y, and in what capacity?  
2) What steps are being ta ken to ensur e that the po licies adopte d by each branch of 
the armed forces to pre vent the deploym ent of 1 7-year old soldiers into  combat 
arenas are being effecti vely imple mented?  
 
Article 2: Compulsory  Recruitmen t 
 
As indicated  in the US report, US law only allows for conscrip tion from the age of 18, 
and is not currently in effect.  
 
Article 3: Voluntary  Recruitment 
 
The United States armed forces al lows for the voluntary recruitment of 17-year olds with 
the consent of their pare nt or guardi an. Howeve r, military recruiters ofte n begin 
contacting p otential recr uits at an ea rlier age to e ncourage lat er enlistment. 
Approximately 55 percent of US you th aged 16-21 say that they have sp oken to a US 
military recruiter.11  
 
US Department of Defense surveys have found that 16 and 1 7-year olds are two to three 
times more likely to consider military enlis tment t han youth over the age of twenty.12 For 
this reason, the US armed forces de vote significant resource s toward recruiting 
individuals u nder the age of 18. It do es this throu gh several avenues, incl uding direct 
access to students at se condary sch ools, studen t enrolment in the Junior Reserve 
Officers Trai ning Corps, and securin g access to contact infor mation for secondary 
school stud ents through  school adm inistrators,  as well as thr ough the ap plication o f the 
Armed Servi ces Vocational Aptit ude Battery (ASVAB, explai ned below).  
 
The armed forces’ delay ed entry program  (Future Soldiers T raining Program) allows 
individuals t o sign an en listment con tract, but not  to report for duty for up to a year. 
Nearly all 17-year olds who sign an e nlistment co ntract enter this program, as it al lows 
them to delay their training until after  their gradu ation.13 
 
In the year ending September 30, 2005, 13,793 r ecruits aged  17 joined th e US armed  
forces: 6,78 0 into the active armed forces (5,387  boys and 1,393 girls), re presenting 
4.46 percent  of all new a ctive duty recruits, and 7 ,013 into the  reserve forces (5,013 
boys and 2,000 girls), re presenting 1 5.3 percent of the total r eserves.14

Recruiter access to students in the p ublic school s:  
 
The US armed forces ha ve long pursued contact with student s though access to 
secondary schools. In 2 001, a contr oversial measure was a dopted by Congress as part 
of the “No Child Left Beh ind Act” (NCLB), which required secondary schools to provid e 
military recruiters with contact infor mation for all juniors and  seniors, an d to conduct  
recruiting activities on school premises. Sect ion 9528 of the Act states th at “each local 
educational agency receiving assista nce under th is Act sha ll provide, on a request made 
by military recruiters or an institut ion of higher e ducation, access to seco ndary school 
students’ na mes, addresses, and tel ephone list ings.”15 Any school failing  to comply with 
a request fo r such infor mation ma y jeopardize t he entire sta te’s access t o federal 
educational aid.  
 
The measure was critici zed by parents and chi ldren who felt that it viola ted students’ 
right to privacy and subj ected them to unwanted contacts fro m military re cruiters. 
Although the law allows students an d their pare nts to withh old personal  information from 
recruiters, a 2007 study found that th ese prov isions are not ef fectively imp lemented. A 
study published by the New York Borough President and th e New York Civil Libertie s 
Union surveyed more th an 1000 stu dents from 45 selected N ew York City schools 
perceived to be particula rly subject t o military recruitment activities.16 It found that in 
violation of t he law and Department of Education  guidelines, 40 percent o f students at  
the selected  schools rep orted that th eir school had not provided them with a military 
recruitment “opt-out” form (allowing them to withhold their na me and contact informati on 
from military recruiters) at the begin ning of the 2 006-2007 academic year. An addition al 
33 percent o f respondent s were not sure whether or not they had received such a form. 
Of the 25 percent of stud ents who reported recei ving the opt-out form, more than one-
third said th at no one fr om their sch ool explaine d the form or their right t o withhold 
personal inf ormation from military re cruiters.17  
 
Individual st ates have also adopted specifi c guid elines regar ding recruite r access to 
students. Alt hough the Department of Education guidelines for the state of New York 
state that cl assroom time is to be used only for instruction, more than one-fifth or 
respondents to the survey (21 percent) reported the use of cl ass time by military 
recruiters. T he survey also found tha t 18 percent of the survey respondents did not 
believe that anyone in their school could properl y advise them of the risks and benefi ts 
of military enlistment, a nd that nearl y half of respondents (4 5 percent) r eported that  they 
did not kno w to whom they should report military misconduct.18  
 
In March 2007, propose d legislat ion entitled the Student Privacy Protection Act of 20 07 
was introdu ced into Co ngress. Its p rovisions would amend the No Child Left Behind Act 
to only allow students’ p ersonal infor mation to be provided to the military if the student ’s 
parent or guardian provides explicit, written consent.19 As of November 20 07, the 
legislat ion h ad 64 co-sp onsors in th e House of Representatives but no formal action had 
been taken.

 4Junior Rese rve Officer T raining Corps 
A major conduit for milit ary recruitment is the Ju nior Reserve Officer Training Corps 
(JRTOC), a n elective pr ogram based in second ary schools across the country that is 
open to stud ents from the age of 14. The progr am’s stated g oal is to “mo tivate young  
people to be  better citi zens.” Althoug h JROTC cadets are not formal me mbers of the 
military, courses are tau ght by retired military personnel, and  include milit ary drills wit h 
both real an d dummy firearms. An estimated 40 percent of st udents who graduate from 
high schoo l with two or more years of JROTC e ventually enlist in the mili tary.20  In 2006, 
486,594 hig h school students were enrolled in a pproximatel y 3,300 JROTC units acr oss 
the country (1555 Army; 224 Marine Corps; 869 Air Force; 6 19 Navy).21 Total enrollment 
in the progr am grew 8 p ercent between 2001 an d 2006, fuel ed by a 57 percent incre ase 
in federal fu nding for the  program. 
ASVAB  
 
The Armed Services Vocational Apti tude Battery is a test d eveloped and funded by the 
Department of Defense. It is administ ered in over 14,000 scho ols and milit ary entrance 
processing stations (MEPS) in the United States.22 The military provides the test to 
schools nationwide, without charge, as a way to gauge stude nts’ aptitude  and strengt hs 
for military service. It is also used to  obtain stud ents’ person al contact information. 
According to the Army’s School Recruiting Progr am Handbo ok, the ASVAB is used t o 
“provide the field recruite r with a sour ce of leads of high scho ol senior an d juniors 
qualified thr ough the ASVAB for enlistment into the Active Army and Army Reserve.”23 
 
The vast ma jority of stud ents taking t he test are u nder age 18, and some are as young 
as 15. (The test is appro ved for grades 10-12.) L ocal organizations have reported that 
students are often not told that the ASVAB is an optional test , and that many school 
administrators are not a ware that they can choose not to sh are test resu lts with the 
military. In some school s, it is made mandatory, and parental  consent i s not sought. 
According to  organizatio ns trackin g military recruitment in hi gh school s, the use of th e 
test “equips recruiters to begin the re cruiting process with young people well before th ey 
turn 18 and without parental approval, and it ena bles recruite rs to override the right 
of parents a nd students to opt out of being inclu ded in the NCLB [No Child Left Behin d] 
student li sts.” 24 
  
Recruiter Misconduct 
 
Reports by the US government and the m edia have documen ted the use of deception , 
coercion, an d other misconduct by military recruit ers seekin g new recruits. These rep orts 
raise concerns regarding  the US’ obli gations to e nsure that r ecruitment of children i nto 
the armed forces is g enuinely voluntary, and done with full an d informed consent.

2007.  
 5In August 2 006, the US Govern ment Accountabil ity Office reported that between fiscal 
years 2004 and 2005, al legations of recruiter i rregularities increased from 4,400 case s to 
6,600 cases; that case s substantiate d by milit ary investigatio ns increase d from just over 
400 cases t o almost 630 cases; an d that crimin al violations more than doubled from 33 
cases to 68 cases.25  The report defin ed recruiter i rregularities as “willful an d unwillful 
acts of omission and im proprieties” perpetrated by a recruiter to facili tate the recruitment 
process for an applicant , including  coercion, fal sification of documents, giving false 
promises, fa iling to di sclose disqua lifying eligibil ity criteria, an d sexual harassment. The 
GAO stated that data col lected by the armed services like ly underestimate the true 
number of recruiter irre gularities, and that 20 p ercent of act ive duty recruiters believ e 
that irregula rities occur f requently.26  The report also found that recruiting irr egularities 
typically peak at the end of the monthly re cruiting cycle, when recruiters ar e under the 
most pressu re to meet their quotas.27 
 
US media h ave also documented recruiter misconduct. A 2 006 ABC Ne ws and WABC 
undercover investigation  found recrui ters in New York City intentionally misinforming 
students ab out the requi rements of enlistment. F or example, hidden cameras caught 
recruiters tel ling potentia l recruits t hat the US wa s not at war, that recruits could ju st 
leave the military after enlistment if t hey didn’t like it, and that  potential re cruits cou ld 
hide drug-a ddiction pro blems.28 
 
In 2005, more than 80 military recruiters were discip lined f or sexual misconduct wit h 
potential enl istees, i ncluding at least  35 Army re cruiters, 18 Marine Corp s recruiters,  18 
Navy recruiters and 12 Air Force recruiters. An i nvestigation  conducted by the 
Associated Press concl uded that on e of out 200 frontline recr uiters were discip lined f or 
sexual misconduct in 20 05, and that most victims were girls b etween the ages of 16 a nd 
18 who were considerin g enlistment  in the milita ry.29 The incid ents of misconduct 
included gro ping, sexual  assault, an d rape. Some  victims reported to th e media that they 
agreed to se xual contact  because th ey believed t hat if they refused, they would not be 
allowed to jo in the militar y, or would receive an undesirable a ssignment.30  
 
Questions for the US Government:  
1) What steps are being ta ken to addre ss recruiter misconduct (including th e use of 
deception, f alsification o f information, coercion, o r other recru iter irregulari ties), 
including m easures to f acilitate re ports of such conduct, to conduct tim ely and 
thorough investigation s, and to take appropriate discip linary or criminal a ction 
against those responsibl e?  
2) What specif ic steps are being taken to prevent and respond t o sexual misconduct 
by recruiters against gir ls who may be consideri ng enlistme nt? How are such 
instance s investigated, and what discipl inary or criminal acti on is taken?

Article 4:  
 
Under Article 4, the States Parties shall take  all feasible measures to prevent recruitment 
of persons under the a ge of 18  years or th eir use in  hosti lities by arm ed groups. This 
includes criminalizing such practi ces. 
 
In the United States, th e Federal Criminal Code does not ad dress the i ssue of chi ld 
recruitment, nor allow prosecution of  an individu al who has r ecruited or u sed child  
soldiers in another count ry and then attempts to take safe ha ven in the United States.   
 
On October 3, 2007, the “Child Soldi er Accounta bility Act” was introduce d into the U.S. 
Senate. This proposed l egislation w ould amend the US criminal code to make the 
recruitment or use of chi ldren under the age of 1 5 a punisha ble crime, whether 
committed in the US or abroad, and to establi sh jurisdi ction over US citizens or non-
nationals pr esent in the United States who commit this crime. Persons convicted of the 
crime could be sentence d for up to 2 0 years in prison, or if de ath results, t o a life 
sentence. T he Act also provides that individuals who recruit or use chil dren under 15 as 
soldiers are inadmissible  or deportable under the Immigration and Nationality Act.31 
 
Precedent for this alrea dy exists in US feder al law.  For exa mple, Chapter 113c of Ti tle 
18, the Crimes and Criminal Procedu re of the US Code makes it a crime f or torture to be 
committed abroad irresp ective of the nationality of the victim or alleged o ffender where 
the alleged offender is p resent in the  US. The provision imposes severe criminal 
penalties on  “whoever o utside the U nited States commits or attempts to commit torture.”  
Jurisdi ction over this cri me applies whether the alleged offe nder is a nat ional of the 
United States, or is pre sent in the United States,  irrespective  of the natio nality of the 
victim or alleged offende r. (Sec. 2340A.)  The first person to b e charged u nder this la w, 
Charles “Chuckie” Taylo r, Jr., son of former Liberian presiden t Charles Ta ylor, was 
indicted in  December 2006.  
 
Another precedent is th e Genocide Accountabili ty Act, which was adopted by the US 
Senate on March 29, 2007. This act am ends the Genocide Convention Implementation 
Act to allow prosecution of non-US nationals who  are in the US for acts of  genocide 
committed outside the U nited States.   
 
Question for the US go vernment:  
1) Will the US  governmen t support le gislation  to make the recruitment of child  
soldier a pu nishable cri me, whether committ ed in the US or abroad, and by either 
US citizens or non-natio nals? 
 
Article 6: Di sarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration 
 
The United States has d etained chi ldren suspected of partici pating in ar med activities in 
US-run detention faci lities in Afghani stan and Ira q and in its Naval Base in Guantánamo, 
Cuba.  In 2006, the ICRC registered 59 children in detention during 16 visits to f ive

 7places of de tention or int ernment controlled by the US or UK i n Iraq.32 US soldiers 
stationed at the detentio n centres an d former detainees described abuse s against child 
detainees, i ncluding the  rape of a 1 5-year old boy at Abu Ghraib, forced  nudity, stress 
positions, b eating, and t he use of do gs.33 Followin g US troop increases i n Iraq in early 
2007, US mi litary arrests of children t here rose fr om an avera ge of 25 per  month in 2006 
to an average of 100 per  month34 Military officials reported 828 children h eld at Camp 
Cropper by mid-September; includin g children a s young as 11.35 A 17-ye ar-old was 
reportedly strangled to d eath by a fellow detaine e in early 2007.36  
 
In August 2 007 the US opened Dar al-Hikmah, a non-reside ntial faci lity intended to 
provide 600 detainees a ge 11 through 17 with education ser vices pendin g release or 
transfer to Ir aqi custody.  US military official s excl uded an esti mated 100 children from 
participation  in the progr am, apparently on the grounds that t hey were “e xtremists” and 
“beyond redemption.”37 
 
As of this wr iting it was n ot clear if children are su bject to the same detention review 
process a s adults, who do not have access to lawyers when presenting t heir case to a 
review board that routin ely decides 20 cases pe r hour, and who must sign pledges of 
good behavior and produce a guara ntor to be released.38 In addition, according to Major 
General Douglas Stone,  as of Septe mber 2007 between 50 and 60 child ren age 15 
through 17 had been tu rned over to Iraqi custod y for trial.39  
Children have also been detained b y US forces in Afghanist an, a number of whom h ave 
been transfe rred to the military detention faci lity at Guantánamo. Omar Ahmed Khadr, a 
Canadian national, was taken into U S custody in Afghanistan  in late Ju ly 2002 when he 
was 15 years old and su bsequently transferred to Guantánamo. In Nove mber 2005, he 
was charge d for trial by military commiss ion und er a Military Order signed by President 
George W. Bush in November 2001. This milit ary commissio n system wa s ruled unla wful 
by the US Supreme Cou rt in June 20 06 and wa s replaced by a revised system under the 
Military Commissions Act (MCA) sign ed into law i n October 2006.  In April 2007, Oma r 
Khadr was charged for trial under the  MCA with murder and attempted murder in 
violation of t he law of war, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and 
spying.40 In June 2007, a military judge dismissed the charges against Kha dr on a 
jurisdi ctional  question.41 On 24 September 2007, a newly established Cou rt of Military

41 At his arraignme nt proceedings in Guantá namo on  4 June 2007, th e military  judg e dismissed the charges against him 
because, while Omar Khadr had b een designated a s an “enem y com batants” in Gu antánamo, no where was there a 
record of his designation as an “u nlawful en emy combatants”, the label which (w hen attached to a n on-US national) i s a

Questions for the US g overnment:  
1) How man y children are currently in US custody in Iraq, Afghanistan and 
Guantanamo for suspected activity with armed groups? 
2) What provisions are bein g made for the release, r ehabilitatio n and reinteg ration 
of children in US detention?  
3) What coordi nation is be ing undertaken with UNICEF or other child prote ction 
agencies to ensure that effective rehabilitation and reintegra tion progra ms are 
put in place ?  
4) If any detained children are suspect ed of criminal activity, what charges,  if any, 
have been made against them?  
5) What steps are being ta ken to adjud icate these cases a s quickly as possible, to 
ensure the children’s a ccess to lega l counsel, an d to ensure compliance with 
international  juvenile just ice standard s?  
6) Do the ICRC and other relevant agencies , such as UNICEF, have full access to 
visit all dete ntion faci lities where chil dren are hel d, and have private acce ss to 
each child ?  
7) How man y children have been released fr om US custody, and what steps have 
been taken t o ensure the ir rehabilitat ion and reint egration?  
8) What is the US doing to develop a policy regardi ng its treatment of childr en 
apprehended during hostilitie s that i s consist ent with its oblig ations under  the 
Optional Protocol?  
 
Article 7: Technical cooperation, financial as sistance for rehabilitation and social 
reintegration 
As reported by the US g overnment, since 2001, the US has contributed US$34 million to 
support pro grams to prevent the recruitment and use of chi ld soldiers and to demobilize 
and reintegr ate child combatants, including US$10 million th rough the US Agency fo r 
International  Developme nt (USAID) and US$24 million throu gh the US Department of 
Labor. It has supported p rograms in Angola, Afghanistan, Bu rundi, Colombia, 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan,  and Uganda. 43 
Former child soldiers wh o seek asylu m or refugee status in the United States face 
serious ob stacles.  The United States Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits a sylum 
or refugee status for indi viduals who have partici pated in the persecution of others, ar e 
inadmissible  or removabl e as a terror ist, or met other specifi ed preclusion s. 44 While 
many child soldiers have been recruit ed (often by  force) in viol ation of inter national law 
and US domestic pol icy, the US has opposed asylum claims of some former child

soldiers.45  
 
In one example, the Department of Homeland Security opposed the asylum claim of 
Salifou Yankene, a former child so ldier in Cote d’ Ivoire. Yankene’s cla im stated that h e 
was forcibly recruited when he was 15 years of age by a rebel soldier s who cut off the 
arm of his lit tle brother when their mother resisted  the recruitment, and who plied him 
with drugs d uring his tw o years of compelled service.  When the immigra tion judge 
granted Yankene’s requ est for asylu m, the government appealed on the grounds that  
Yankene was a “persecu tor.”46 In anot her case, th e Departme nt of Homeland Security 
for years opposed asylu m for a youn g man who, as a chil d of 14, was forcibly 
conscripte d into the army of a governm ent that had previously jailed and tortured him.47 
 
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, foll owed by the  REAL ID Act of 2005, created further 
obstacle s to former child soldiers seeking refuge  in the Unite d States by expanding the 
Immigration and Nationality Act’s defi nition of “ter rorist activity” to include “ material 
support” to any organization that ha s engaged i n “terrorist a ctivity.”48  The Department of 
Homeland Security has argued that “material support” may i nclude su ch non-violent 
activity such  as portering , cooking, or  even payin g extortion.49  Further, the expansion of 
the definitio n of “terrorist activity” may bar anyo ne who has ever borne arms in a non-
state armed group or provided support to any  armed group from receiving asylum or 
refugee stat us. 
 
In sum, United States a gencies hav e refused to recognize a ny legal exceptions or 
defenses to either the pe rsecutor or t errorism bars for former child so ldiers who have 
been illegal ly recruited or forced to p articipate i n an armed group.  Indeed , former chill s 
soldiers ma y be excluded even without any ev idence that t hey were involved in human 
rights violati ons. 
 
Questions for the US g overnment:  
1) How man y former child soldiers hav e sought asylum or refu gee status i n the 
United States?  
2) In how man y cases has the US gove rnment opposed such claims, includi ng 
taking step s to overturn decision s to grant former child so ldiers status?  
3) Will the US government consider i ssuing guideli nes for the consideration  of 
claims to asylum or refu gee status b y child soldi ers that would recognize  that the 
persecutor/ “material support” bar to asylum should not appl y to child sol diers 
recruited in violation of i nternational law?
