Alabama, that mandatory sentences of life without parole for youth under 18 at the time of offense were unconstitutional. The senators instead proposed a 50-year mandatory minimum sentence for youth offenders convicted of homicide.The Supreme Court ruled in Miller that a mandatory sentence of life without parole, in barring a judge from considering a young offender’s “age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes” violates the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The court said judges must be able to take into account potentially mitigating factors — their precise role in the offense, family and home environment, and rehabilitation potential.Sen. Rob Bradley, Republican of Orange Park, ostensibly proposed the new legislation, Senate Bill 1350, to comply with Miller — but in reality, it was crafted to get around the Supreme Court’s ruling.SB 1350 allowed judges to consider mitigating factors, but with a catch. The judge could still issue a life sentence — which in Florida means death in prison, since the state has effectively abolished parole. But if the judge found that certain circumstances merited a lower sentence, it could be no less than 50 years.Effectively, SB 1350 created a “choice” between two life sentences for youth offenders convicted of homicide. Prison drives down life expectancy. One study found that 20 years in prison will on average cut 16 years off an inmate’s life. With the life expectancy of US males at 76 years, a youth offender entering prison with a 50 year sentence at 16 would be expected to die in prison at 60, with six years left to serve.So there is essentially no difference between that 50-year sentence and the mandatory life without parole that the Supreme Court found unconstitutional.Fortunately, a majority of senators recognized that SB 1350 was a likely target for a court challenge. Republican Sen. Rene Garcia, of Hialeah, proposed an amendment empowering judges to review a youth’s sentence and revise it if appropriate in keeping with Miller’s argument that youth are distinctively capable of redemption. The first review could happen only after someone sentenced to 50 years or more had served 25 years. (Other states have started reviews as early as after 15 years).Sen. Garcia’s amendment also embraced the spirit of Miller and other recent cases by requiring periodic reviews of the need for continued incarceration. He crafted language to respect the rights of victims and their families by ensuring them a voice in the review process if they chose.The amendment passed, but the Senate chose not to vote on the bill, effectively killing it for the 2013 session.What happened on the Senate floor in the closing days of the session provides hope, though, for a resolution in 2014. The starting point should be the Miller decision — moving away from excessive sentencing for youth. And it should encompass the resolve of lawmakers like Sen. Garcia to allow Florida’s judges to review sentences for youth, with tough and fair guidelines provided by the Legislature.The Florida Legislature should not spend its time trying to craftily dodge a Supreme Court ruling. It should tackle this difficult issue directly and fairly. Next year, Florida has the chance to get it right.Antonio Ginatta is U.S. advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal JusticeTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingJune 25, 2012News ReleaseUS Supreme Court: Positive Youth Sentencing RulingApril 5, 2013LetterFlorida: End Life Without Parole for Youth OffendersReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingJune 25, 2012News ReleaseUS Supreme Court: Positive Youth Sentencing RulingApril 5, 2013LetterFlorida: End Life Without Parole for Youth OffendersMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
