California tried some of the youth pictured here as adults who then spent decades in prison for a crime committed when 14 or 15, others were kept in the juvenile justice system where they received age-appropriate education and counseling, and some had no contact with the justice system at all. Those pictured are now probation chiefs, lawyers, leaders in restorative justice, county heads of nongovernmental organizations and among the authors of the report.(Los Angeles) – California Governor Jerry Brown has signed into law SB 1391 ensuring that 14- and 15-year-olds accused of crimes will be tried in the juvenile justice system rather than prosecuted as adults. The following quote can be attributed to Elizabeth Calvin, senior children's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch:“By treating 14- and 15-year-olds as the children they still are, California is acting to promote their potential while protecting public safety. Research shows youth tried in the juvenile system are less likely to commit new crimes than those prosecuted as adults. By signing SB 1391, Governor Brown is modernizing California law to reflect that young people can be rehabilitated and grow into successful adults who contribute much to society.”Miguel Garcia faced a sentence of life in prison for a crime committed when he was 15 but had the good fortune to be kept in the juvenile system. He recently graduated from UC Riverside, is working full time and planning to go to law school. The following quote can be attributed to him:“This means no other kids will be left without hope. It means 14- and 15-year-olds will have a chance to learn from their mistakes, be rehabilitated and not create new victims. I know from personal experience that when you get that chance it tells you people care about you. That gives you hope and the drive to embrace treatment and change.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal JusticeTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingAugust 21, 2018StatementFutures DeniedReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingAugust 21, 2018StatementFutures DeniedMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
