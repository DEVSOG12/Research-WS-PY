NCMEC provides an array of resources, including case management, poster distribution, law enforcement technical assistance, and analytical support. Every report of a missing child receives a prompt response from NCMEC’s case management staff who coordinate directly with all case workers, social workers and/or law enforcement agencies involved to provide resources to help safely locate the missing child.Reporting all children missing from care to NCMEC is not just a best practice, but also a legal requirement. NCMEC can provide missing child case support, to assist state agencies fulfilling these requirements and ultimately help provide a better response to children in need.How to Report a Child Missing From CareConfidentialityNCMEC takes care to protect and maintain the privacy of information regarding missing children, and consults with the parent/guardian and investigating law enforcement agency before disseminating identifying information publicly. Additionally, NCMEC does not generally make any public reference to the fact that a child is missing from foster care,  was in state custody at the time they went missing, or that they are likely the victim of child sex trafficking.  Additionally, NCMEC does not generally share any medical or other sensitive information about the child. Finally, any analytical support that NCMEC generates will only be shared with law enforcement for the purpose of locating the missing child.1. Immediately contact the local law enforcement agencyFile a missing child report and ask that the child's information be entered into the FBI's National Crime and Information Center database (NCIC).*There is no waiting period for law enforcement to take a report and enter the child into the NCIC system.Be prepared to provide all identifying information on the missing childThe child's first and last nameChild’s date of birth, gender, height, and weightAny endangerments pertaining to the childThe circumstances surrounding the child’s disappearanceA report to law enforcement and entry into NCIC does not automatically generate a report to NCMEC.2.

Among other improvements related to record-keeping, this legislation amended federal law to ensure that law enforcement agencies respond appropriately and coordinate with NCMEC and social service agencies when a child goes missing from foster care. 34 U.S.C. § 41308.Savanna’s ActSavanna’s Act (25 U.S.C. § 5701 et seq.) improves the response to missing or murdered Native Americans by increasing coordination among Federal, State, and Tribal agencies, expanding data collection, as well as providing additional grants and resources dedicated to reducing further tragedies.Other Relevant Federal LawsFederal law defines a “missing child’ as any individual less than 18 years of age whose whereabouts are unknown to the child’s parent or legal guardian. 34 U.S.C. § 11292. It is important to note this includes children who have gone missing for any reason at all. In some jurisdictions, state law expands on the broad federal definition and provides further statutory guidance on how agencies should treat missing child cases in their state.Existing federal law requires law enforcement agencies to respond in a specific way, regardless of the reason why a child is missing. Law enforcement agencies are prohibited from establishing or maintaining a waiting period before accepting a missing child report, and must promptly enter information regarding a missing child into the NCIC system within two hours of receiving a report. 34 U.S.C. § 41308.NCMEC SupportNCMEC provides an array of resources, including case management, poster distribution, our long-term missing children initiative, and analytical support, among many others.View Available Case ResourcesCritical & Endangered Runaway CasesNCMEC provides technical assistance to law enforcement and support to parents or guardians of children who are missing under critical circumstances or who have run away from their home or placement.Our case management staff have specialized skills in locating and recovering these missing children and build strong working relationships with the particular law enforcement officers and social service agencies that interact with the child.Learn moreChild Sex TraffickingCase Management staff work closely with legal guardians and law enforcement agencies to provide technical assistance and coordinate NCMEC resources, including family support services.

Resource Specialists on this team are available to assist child welfare professionals in the development of intentional, trauma-informed, and victim-centered plans for when the youth returns to placement or is recovered by law enforcement. Case consultation and expert guidance is provided around effective strategies for youth engagement and safety planning, promising practices to address running behavior, and understanding the experiences and needs of youth who have experienced child sex trafficking. Resource Specialists are regionally assigned to provide state-specific guidance and connection to statewide and local specialized child sex trafficking resources.If you are interested in resources or assistance please email RecoveryServices@ncmec.org.Learn moreChildren on the Autism SpectrumChildren on the autism spectrum go missing under a variety of circumstances. They may seek out small or enclosed spaces, wander toward places of special interest to them, or try to escape overwhelming stimuli. Children missing from care who fall on the autism spectrum should be identified upon reporting to NCMEC so that appropriate support services and guidance can be provided.Learn moreLong-Term Case SupportIn the event a child missing from care is not recovered soon after they go missing, it is important to have taken steps to prepare for a long-term missing case. In such cases NCMEC can assist through the Forensic Services Unit, Team Adam, Biometrics Team and Forensic Imaging Team. The Forensic Imaging Team can create age-progressed images of what the child may look like today, which can be helpful in locating the child in a long-term case.Learn moreAdditional Resources & SupportOnce a case is reported to NCMEC, and the child has been entered in NCIC, Case Management staff will coordinate the creation and dissemination of a poster, to include on social media platforms, to help generate leads. Analytical support, via NCMEC’s Analytical Services Division, will forward leads received by NCMEC to the investigating law enforcement agency. When appropriate, referrals are made to NCMEC’s Family Advocacy Division and/or Team HOPE for families in crisis and needing emotional support.Family Advocacy DivisionTeam HOPEResourcesChildren Missing from Care: 2019 UpdateDownload (EN)Children Missing from Care at a Glance: 2017Download (EN)Children Missing From Care InitiativeDownload (EN)Investigative Checklist for Law Enforcement When Helping Unsupervised and Runaway ChildrenDownload (EN)Download (ES)Child Sex Trafficking in America: A Guide for Child Welfare ProfessionalsDownload (EN)Download (ES)Subscribe ►Get the latest updates from NCMECENSPBlogMediaContactLegal T&CDonor PrivacyOur ImpactCareersAbout UsLeadershipFloridaNew YorkTexasCopyright © National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
