We’ve organized these factors into three categories. The list below is not exhaustive and many factors may be interconnected.Societal & EnvironmentalRacismBullyingLack of resourcesInvolvement in child welfare or juvenile justice systemsGang activitySexismXenophobiaFamilyInter-generational sexual abuseLack of acceptance of gender identity or sexual orientationHousing instability/homelessnessImmigration statusAdverse childhood experiences:Domestic violenceHousehold substance abusePhysical/emotional neglect or abuseSexual abuseFamilies with untreated mental health issuesIndividualHistory of traumaLack of supportive family or adult figuresLow self-esteemDevelopmental or physical disabilitySubstance abuseChild Sex Trafficking IndicatorsChild Sex Trafficking VulnerabilitiesIndicatorsSurvivors of child sex trafficking often are unable to self-identify as victims or disclose their abuse because of fear, shame or loyalty to their abuser(s). It is not a child’s responsibility to ask for help. It is up to professionals and trusted adults in the child’s life to recognize the signs associated with child sex trafficking.Red flags or indicators should not be considered a checklist or an assessment tool. Rather, if observed they may be an opportunity to ask more questions, make a report to NCMEC’s CyberTipline or connect the child to resources for prevention or intervention.Physical IndicatorsSigns of sexual or physical abuseSymptoms of neglect such as malnourishmentUnaddressed or chronic medical/dental issues or STIsClose association with an overly controlling adultRecovered at hotels, street tracks, strip clubs, or other locations where commercial sex is known to occurHas a secret cell phone or apps providing multiple cellphone numbersIn possession of material items inconsistent with the child’s access to money or socioeconomic statusLiving out of suitcases, motels, in a car or other evidence of housing insecurityIn possession of bulk sexual paraphernalia such as condoms or lubricantUnexplained access to large amounts of cash, pre-paid cards, or hotel keysTattoos or other branding, such as those indicating money or matching other known trafficking victims, or that the child is reluctant to explainReferences traveling to other cities or states while missing, or while their whereabouts were unknownDrug abuse or frequent use of “party drugs” such as GHB, Rohypnol, Ketamine, MDMA (Ecstasy), or MethamphetaminesBehavioral IndicatorsChronically runs away from home (especially 3+ missing incidents)Unexplained absences from schoolConstantly sleeps during classStops engaging in activities they previously enjoyedAbruptly disconnects from family and friendsSignificant changes in behavior, including their online activityAppears overly frightened, annoyed, resistant, or belligerent to authority figuresAvoids answering questions or lets others speak for themLies about age and identity or has a secret online profileUses language or emojis often associated with commercial sex such as “trick”, “the life”, or “the game”References online escort ads or dating websites/appsBy the NumbersIn 2021, NCMEC received more than17,200 reportsof possible child sex trafficking.NCMEC has received reports of child sex trafficking inall 50 U.S. States, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.These reports include incidents occurring in every type of community: suburban, rural, urban, and tribal lands.Trends show us that when children run away frequently or for long periods of time, they tend to be running from an unsafe situation or to an unsafe situation.1 in 6of the more than 25,000 cases of children reported missing to NCMEC in 2021 who had run away were likely victims of child sex trafficking.Of the children reported missing to NCMEC in 2021, who had run from the care of child welfare,19%were likely victims of child sex trafficking.What NCMEC is Doing About itProviding a Specialized ResponseNCMEC provides training, case management, clearinghouse resources, analytical support, family and peer support, and recovery services assistance on reports involving child sex trafficking, including:Child Sex Trafficking Analytical TeamThe Child Sex Trafficking Team resources are available to law enforcement only.  For assistance please reach out to 1-800-THE-LOST and ask to speak with a member of this team.Reviews CyberTipline reports relating to child sex trafficking and makes them available to law enforcement for review and potential investigation;Conducts link analysis to connect potential victims and/or offenders in multiple states or locations;Provides specialized child sex trafficking analytical assistance to law enforcement to assist with the location and recovery of survivors;Leverages open source data and specialized child sex trafficking technology tools to develop information and leads;Analyzes phone numbers, names, email addresses, and/or publicly accessible online presence of possible traffickers to support law enforcement with the location and recovery of missing children exploited through child sex trafficking.Child Sex Trafficking Recovery Planning and ServicesThe Child Sex Trafficking Recovery Services Team (RST) provides specialized technical assistance and resources to child welfare workers, foster parents and law enforcement who are working with missing children who are also victims of child sex trafficking.
