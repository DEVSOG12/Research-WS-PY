In some circumstancesfamily abductions can be considered a crime under federal or state law, and criminal statutes vary across the country about what conduct is considered unlawful.There are a number of preventative steps parents may choose to take if they fear that a family member may attempt to abduct their child.Obtain a custody determination from the court which specifically outlines custody and visitation rights.Request that the judge include abduction-prevention measures in a description of the visitation rights such as supervised visitation, posting a bond, entering a child’s name in the Passport Issuance Alert Program, and surrendering a child’s passport to the court.Advise the child’s school or daycare of custody orders, flag passport applications for your child, and have children memorize essential information such as home address and phone number in case of emergencies.If a court order prohibits the child’s removal from the country, enroll him/her in the “Prevent Departure” ProgramClick here if you would like to request training around this issue for your community or law enforcement organization.MythFamily abductions aren’t harmful, because the child is with a parent or family member.FactDecades of research across multiple fields have illustrated the serious and harmful effects that family abductions can have on child victims and their families.Risk FactorsNCMEC has found that certain conditions may increase the risk that a family member may abduct a child. However, the absence of any of the following does not mean that an abduction will not occur. These risk factors include having a family member who:Has previously abducted or threatened to abduct a childHas a history of marital instability, lack of cooperation with the other parent, domestic violence, or child abuseHas a criminal recordHas stronger ties to a different state, province, or country than those to where s/he currently residesHas no job, can work anywhere, or is financially independentIs engaged in planning activities such as quitting a job, selling a home, closing accounts, hiding or destroying documents, purchasing travel tickets for your child, altering their appearance, or applying for renewed or duplicate documents for the child such as;New passports or visasBirth certificatesSchool or medical recordsA custody order is not required to report a child missing to local law enforcement. Similarly, a custody determination is not required to have a missing child’s information entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Missing Person File.Federal law prohibits law enforcement from establishing a waiting period before accepting a missing child report, and requires law enforcement agencies to respond to in a specific way, regardless of the reason why a child is missing.If a parent/guardian has difficulties getting law enforcement to take a report or enter a missing child’s information into NCIC, contact NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678).By the NumbersOf the 29,859 cases of missing children reported to NCMEC in 2020, 4.8% were family abductions.In 2020, 63% of all AMBER alerts that were issued were for family abduction cases.What NCMEC is Doing About itLegal Technical Assistance for FamiliesNCMEC provides legal technical assistance concerning family abduction to parents/guardians, the attorneys who serve them, law enforcement, and judicial officials.
