These children are highly vulnerable and can experience homelessness when they are missing. According to a recent report from Chapin Hall,1 in 30 adolescent minors ages 13 to 17 endures some form of homelessness in a year.Risk FactorsThe risk factors for running away from home or state care are multifaceted, and there is no typical Endangered Runaway.The following factors may put youth at an increased risk of running away or becoming homeless:Physical or sexual abuseFamily conflictLack of acceptance of gender identity or sexual orientationStruggling to manage mental healthSubstance abuseMedical issue/developmental or physical disabilityPregnancyOnline enticementTo be with a friend, romantic partner, or biological familyGang activityChild sex traffickingSocial rejection or bullyingBy the Numbers77%of Endangered Runaways reported to NCMEC were between 15-17 years old.87%of these missing children had at least one reported risk factor and62%had two or more risk factors.To search for a missing child and view posters of those missing in your area, click here.What NCMEC is Doing About itNCMEC PartnershipsNCMEC partners with a variety of organizations that share our commitment to helping families and young people stay safe.NCMEC is proud to partner with the National Runaway Safeline. We encourage local communities to implement their evidence-based Let's Talk: Runaway Prevention Curriculum.Supporting Victims and FamiliesFor families with a missing or sexually exploited child, NCMEC provides support services like crisis intervention and local counseling referrals to appropriate professionals. Our Team HOPE program connects families with peers who have had similar experiences and can offer coping skills and compassion. When a missing child is recovered, we help families with the reunification process, including mental health services and travel assistance.Raising Public Awareness to Help Bring Them HomeWith help from our private-sector photo partners, we coordinate the creation and dissemination of missing child posters to targeted geographic areas to help generate leads and engage the public in the search.The public can also help in the recovery efforts by signing up in The ADAM Program to receive missing child alerts in their area.Runaway Train 25Twenty-five years ago, the song "Runaway Train" featured missing children in its music video and helped close 21 cases! For the 25th anniversary of the song, we reimagined "Runaway Train" with new artists and a dynamic music video that updates itself with missing children from the NCMEC database based on a user's location. That means more missing children in front of more people in more relevant places.Watch #RunawayTrain25 and help us bring home #Missingkids.RunawayTrain25.comResourcesAnalysis of Cases Involving Missing Children with Suicidal TendenciesDownloadSubscribe ►Get the latest updates from NCMECENSPBlogMediaContactLegal T&CDonor PrivacyOur ImpactCareersAbout UsLeadershipFloridaNew YorkTexasCopyright © National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
