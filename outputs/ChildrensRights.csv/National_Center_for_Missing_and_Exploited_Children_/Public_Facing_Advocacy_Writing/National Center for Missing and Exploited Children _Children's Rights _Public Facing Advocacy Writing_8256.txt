SURVIVORS OF CHILD SEX ABUSE 
MATERIAL ARE STUCK IN A 
UNIQUE CYCLE OF TRAUMACAPTURED  
ON FILM:Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.FOREWORD
At the National Center for Missing & 
Exploited Children, we’ve reviewed 
millions of child sexual abuse images. 
We’ve witnessed the victimization of 
children worldwide, and we’ve helped law 
enforcement locate the children in these 
images so they can remove them from these 
abusive situations. At this unique moment 
in history, a small group of survivors has 
mobilized and shared with us what they face 
when the sexual abuse ends. Today, we’re 
fortunate to hear their voices, and now we 
can confidently state the stark reality:  
This is a different kind of trauma.
This white paper will be a living document, 
updated with new insights to help identify 
gaps in treatment and support for survivors 
of child sexual abuse material beginning with 
mental health practitioners, then attorneys, 
law enforcement, victim advocates and 
others. We encourage readers to recognize 
the complex nature of this type of crime 
and the unique treatment implications for 
survivors, while committing to work alongside 
other helping professionals in a continuum 
of care model to ensure justice, healing and 
post-traumatic growth within this previously 
unseen population.

WHY THIS TRAUMA IS DIFFERENT
In communities around the globe, survivors of child sexual abuse material live with 
the debilitating fear the photos and videos memorializing their sexual abuse as a 
child and shared on the internet will forever remain online for anyone to see.
Many of these children are re-victimized as their images are shared again and again, 
often well into adulthood, even decades later, and they constantly worry someone 
who has seen their images will recognize them in public.
Hear their terrified voices:
“I try to live as invisibly as 
possible … try to impress upon 
myself that the chance of 
recognition is really very small, 
since I’m much older now. 
But the feeling persists.”“I do not want to socialize;  
I’m scared to step out of the door.”
“I worry about this every day. 
I’m afraid for my children’s safety, 
try to avoid going out … [I’m] 
really paranoid when I take my 
kids to places like the zoo.”1“I try to cover my face with my hair.”
At the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC), our 
CyberTipline® has received more than 50 million reports of suspected child sexual 
exploitation from its launch in 1998 through June 2019 – 18.4 million in 2018 alone. 
The vast majority of these reports contain child sexual abuse material – a stunning 
indictment of the insatiable demand for this abusive imagery on the internet.
In the last decade, there’s been enormous progress made to disrupt the distribution 
of these images and prosecute those who share the experience of victimizing 
children with other offenders. In large part, this progress is due to technological 
advances to find these images online, leading to an increase in the number of 
reports to NCMEC’s CyberTipline. Thanks to new technology, resources and 
training, more children in these images are being identified by law enforcement: 
17,305 children, as of June 30, 2019.
The most glaring hole in this process? Helping survivors rebuild their lives.

What we’re learning from these survivors is that they and their affected family 
members aren’t getting the specialized help they need for this unique, often 
complex and ongoing victimization. Their trauma doesn’t end with an arrest of the 
offender. For some, their sexually explicit images along with details of their personal 
lives and identities are repackaged, recirculated, and distributed for years online.
These survivors desperately need our help. To that end, we’re conducting a 
series of roundtables to better understand their trauma and engage child-serving 
professionals about this growing population of survivors, many of whom are 
suffering in silence.
Our first roundtable was comprised of professionals from the mental health 
community who are uniquely positioned to help with this relatively new kind 
of victimization. Future roundtables include, but are not limited to, attorneys, 
law enforcement, survivors, child protective services workers, victim advocates, 
educators and nonoffending family members of survivors. As we host these 
roundtables, we will update findings and recommendations from each of these 
working populations to help identify solutions.
WHAT’S BEING TRADED ONLINE?
Before we can begin a discussion about how to help these survivors, it’s important 
to understand how the internet has fueled the demand for child sexual abuse 
material (CSAM) and what is being traded online.
Sexual abuse of children is not new, nor is it unique to any country, culture or 
socio-economic status. Before the internet, child sex abuse images were published 
in illegal print magazines, shipped through the mail via VHS tapes and DVDs, or 
shared in person.
The internet didn’t create the demand for these sexually abusive images, but it 
certainly made it easier to share them on a massive scale, as did the transition 
to digital cameras, the increase in internet availability worldwide, the decreasing 
cost of digital storage devices, and, perhaps most importantly, the anonymity the 
internet provides.
Because these images – which are digital depictions of crime scenes – could have 
been produced anywhere in the world, it was not apparent in what city, state or 
country the abuse occurred or in which jurisdiction the images should be reported 
and prosecuted. In 1998, NCMEC launched the CyberTipline, the designated 
location in the U.S. to report suspected child sexual exploitation.
Our analysts began reviewing these images and identifying the jurisdiction where 
the offender may be located. All reports, and any additional information, are made 
available to the appropriate law enforcement agency for possible investigation.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma5
As images recirculated, our analysts began to see children known to have already 
been identified by law enforcement and removed from the abusive situation. 
Therefore, NCMEC established a national clearinghouse in 2002, the Child Victim 
Identification Program, to receive information from law enforcement on those 
victims they identified in CSAM.
Leveraging NCMEC’s unique lens and data, a collaborative research study was 
conducted in cooperation with NCMEC, Thorn, the Royal Ottawa Health Care 
Group, the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of Edinburgh. 
The study, titled Production and Active Trading of Child Sexual Exploitation Images 
Depicting Identified Victims,2 gave us insight into offenders and their likely victims 
per the key report highlights below.
• Content:  “The most notable historical finding was a trend toward more 
egregious sexual content over time, with more cases involving explicit sexual 
conduct in later years. In contrast, there were no obvious trends in terms of child 
victim age or gender.”
• Victim-Offender Trends:  “In cases involving a single victim and single offender, 
actively traded cases were associated with having prepubescent victims. Actively 
traded cases were also associated with more egregious content in terms of 
sexual activity, and more likely to involve familial offenders, particularly nuclear 
family members.”
• Offender Relationship to Victim:  “While most cases involved male offenders who 
were unrelated to the child, cases involving female offenders, younger children, or 
more egregious content were more likely to involve familial offenders.”
In January 2016, a survey of more than 150 survivors around the globe was 
spearheaded by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection with collaboration 
from NCMEC. The goal of this survey was to learn more about these survivors 
and determine what policy, legislative and therapeutic changes are needed. The 
findings uncovered significant gaps in their care and the results were published in 
September 2017 in the International Survivors’ Survey.3
In February 2018, 11 of the survey respondents gathered together for the first 
time in Phoenix, Arizona. At this groundbreaking event, individuals from the first 
generation of survivors whose imagery was produced and simultaneously uploaded 
to the internet, many whose images are still traded today, discussed shared 
experiences and challenges, including barriers to getting mental health services to 
assist in their healing and recovery (reference Appendix A). NCMEC was moved by 
the voices of the “Phoenix 11,” as they call themselves, and leveraged our decades 
of experience to initiate and host targeted roundtables to help identify solutions. 
Our goal is simple: transform survivor voices into actionable solutions.

FOCUS ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE

continuum of care [Abstract]. Health Matrix, 
7(1), 30–39. Retrieved from https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10293297The collective voice of the Phoenix 11 made clear that the systems of care 
established to help children and survivors needed better integration and education 
about the issues of child sexual abuse material in the hopes of increasing the 
connective services received by survivors. To improve this gap in services, NCMEC 
looked to the Continuum of Care4 model as a guide. This concept, typically found in 
the medical model, involves a system to guide and track patients over time through 
a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and intensity of care. 
The Continuum of Care covers the delivery of healthcare over time and may refer to 
care provided from birth to the end of life. Through NCMEC’s work with survivors, 
this concept emerged as a relevant model to create a safety net of resources, 
information and guidance for this population.
As NCMEC has facilitated more discussions with child-serving professionals, 
results reinforce findings from the International Survivor’s Survey  that resources are 
woefully inadequate for survivors 
and their families struggling to 
navigate complex systems of care.
NCMEC continues to find all 
roundtable participants stress the 
need for helping professionals, 
including attorneys, those in law 
enforcement and child protective 
services, and others typically 
outside the health field, to work 
together to create a model safety 
net encouraging a Continuum 
of Care specially designed to 
meet child sexual abuse material 
survivors’ unique needs. The goal 
of our work is for a model like this 
to help ensure survivors are better 
able to access needed resources; 
have a better understanding of 
how resources work collaboratively; 
and ultimately promote better, 
safer and faster healing.“We recommend to 
helping professionals: 
Be transparent 
about who all is 
involved in the 
investigation 
process. Give us 
opportunities to 
meet the people 
involved. Let us know 
what information 
is being shared 
and with whom.”
PHOENIX 11Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.A CALL TO ACTION  
TO MENTAL HEALTH  
PRACTITIONERS
Most mental health practitioners are not aware of, nor have they been trained 
about, the unique trauma recovery needs of survivors depicted in sexual abuse 
material. Help generally centers solely on the child sexual abuse endured, not 
the additional trauma resulting from the production and distribution of imagery 
of that abuse.
In November 2018, NCMEC convened a group of 14 mental health practitioners 
who had varying levels of clinical experience working with these survivors or 
evaluating lifetime care benefits in restitution cases.
The three-day roundtable utilized a working group and breakout session format 
to facilitate discussions. Led by a team of facilitators, the group discussed topics 
including the unique continual trauma experience of this crime type, legal 
perspectives, the medical and international response to these types of cases, 
and technology used to combat sexual abuse material online. An adult survivor 
of child sexual abuse material shared her story to keep the discussion focused 
on the survivor’s experience and needs. The roundtable’s key findings are 
shared below.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma8
A Different Kind of Trauma
Practitioners felt the collective mental health community has little knowledge of how 
the memorializing of sexual abuse through photos and videos impacts the victim. 
There’s been decades of research devoted to better understand and treat child 
sexual abuse survivors. However, with the rise of the internet, the production, trading 
and distribution of child sexual abuse material online skyrocketed and the field has 
yet to adequately grapple with this phenomenon in a treatment capacity.
There was consensus in this group that treating these survivors requires a better 
understanding of the long-term negative impact imagery has on the healing 
process for this population. A deeper analysis of the unique nature of this crime 
and outcomes for survivors is critical and requires more funding, research and 
training to better equip the mental health community and increase the availability 
of trained professionals to treat this unique population. These specific areas 
require additional research:
• Effective treatment modalities
• Brain/body connections
• Likely effects of survivor 
exposure to their images• Client progress as determined 
by standardized measurement 
tools or individual milestones
• Practical guidelines for care 
across the lifespan of a client
All practitioners agreed, at every level of clinical practice education, technology-
facilitated crimes committed against children should be addressed. While this 
over-arching topic may encompass various forms of abuse, such as online 
enticement and child sex trafficking, dedicated attention must be focused on 
studying the consequences of child sexual abuse material on the victim.
How to Help These Survivors
While each practitioner shared specific treatment modalities used to address clinical 
needs, it became clear one type of treatment does not address every unique issue 
found within this population.
This revelation was validated through the personal reflections of the adult survivor. 
The survivor had sought out six different treatment professionals throughout 
her healing journey. Based on findings from survivor surveys and the roundtable 
TAKEAWAYS
• More research is needed about the differences between child 
sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material, specifically the unique 
trauma production and trading of imagery has on the survivor.
• Targeted education and training is critical for mental health.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma9
discussions, it was suggested some providers may have applied methods not 
tailored to meet the unique needs of these survivors. However, the survivor 
participating in the roundtable reframed this assumption by asserting that, in her 
experience, each provider addressed appropriate needs at that life stage, providing 
a holistic and complementary treatment plan to meet her needs.
Since not every clinician is versed in all forms of intervention, roundtable 
participants concluded the field should provide a more streamlined approach 
to treatment for their clients by encouraging connection and continuity among 
clinicians. In these particular treatment scenarios, special attention should be paid 
to the best practice of consulting with other providers during transition phases of 
treatment. This practice is recommended to improve the continuity of care.
The role of the mental health professional is not only to promote and affect 
healing from trauma, but also to surround the client with appropriate and healthy 
influences. By working with a network of support, survivors can connect with 
multiple professionals, each providing a needed service and working to restore the 
survivor’s confidence and trust in others.
Treatment modalities discussed to address specific issues included:
• Expressive therapies such 
as play, art and drama
• Brain-based therapy
• Attachment-based therapy
• Parts work therapy
• Animal-assisted therapies• Cognitive therapies such as trauma-
focused cognitive behavioral 
therapy, mindfulness, acceptance 
and commitment therapy, rational 
emotive behavior therapy, and 
cognitive restructuring
For treatment providers, there 
are various ways to measure 
client progress. Practitioners 
discussed empowering survivors 
to take control of their progress 
by recognizing those moments 
of simple victories in their lives, 
as they serve an important 
role of helping survivors see 
these small steps as healing 
opportunities. There is also a 
clear need to create and develop 
more standardized assessment 
tools for practitioners to track 
improvements, while also 
recognizing individual milestones 
as markers of progress.The survivor also 
regularly participates 
in what she called 
“maintenance 
therapy” to 
remain cognizant 
of the triggers 
and symptoms 
faced throughout 
the lifespan.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma10
For some survivors, progress or post-traumatic growth may be found in advocacy 
work, or in helping fellow survivors. Practitioners agreed the health and well-being 
of a survivor should take precedence over advancing any social cause. In addition, 
taking steps in this direction can be particularly challenging for this survivor group 
as most survivors of CSAM have never met someone who has experienced this kind 
of trauma.
Loss of Control
Many survivors say, because they have no control over the spread of the abusive 
material online, they live in fear. They don’t know who’s seen their images or videos 
online, so they constantly worry about being recognized in public. It interferes with 
all aspects of their lives and fear is rampant.
All roundtable practitioners agreed part of the healing process is to promote, 
encourage and participate in giving back to clients a sense of control, including 
social media, basic life skills, employment and educational opportunities.
A key is helping clients recognize triggers and working to desensitize them.  
A trigger could be as simple as the click of a camera, someone pulling out a phone, 
anatomy classes in school settings or an unknown person showing an interest in the 
survivor when in public. These are not unwarranted fears. In certain circumstances, 
criminals use everyday tools like social media, an email address, a utility bill or even 
high school class photos to locate their victims both online and in person.
How can we best help survivors cope with these fears? Everyone agreed it’s the 
practitioner’s duty to distinguish to what degree those fears should be validated. 
Letting them know they’re not being unreasonable by having these fears and that 
there may even be a need for a safety plan is useful. But it’s also beneficial to help 
survivors understand the miniscule odds of encountering someone, say in a grocery 
store, who has seen their abusive material online.
There is a difficulty in balancing perception and reality as practitioners help 
survivors confidently navigate their online and offline worlds. It can be challenging 
to restructure their thoughts about the likelihood someone has seen them when the 
breadth of distribution worldwide can be astounding. There are no easy answers.
Another more delicate topic to address is a desire for some survivors to find their 
own images online. This need to “know what is out there about me”  can pose 
TAKEAWAYS
• Assist clients in connecting 
with other clinicians.
• Surround clients with 
healthy influences.• Consider multiple 
treatment modalities.
• Measure progress.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma11
significant treatment considerations. 
Practitioners may need to broach 
this subject on a case-by-case basis 
and consider the risks for their clients 
seeking this type of knowledge. 
NCMEC strongly encourages 
consultation between the investigating 
law enforcement agency and the 
mental health professional if the desire 
to view images becomes a critical topic 
in treatment.
We are on the edge of a paradigm 
shift in the way professionals 
respond to child sexual abuse 
material. Tremendous strides have 
recently been made that challenge 
the prevailing belief of “once an 
image is out there, you can’t get 
it back.” Technological tools have 
been developed to assist companies 
in detecting abusive material on their servers so they can immediately remove 
these images and videos. In addition, every day, NCMEC and other organizations, 
such as the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, Thorn and the Internet Watch 
Foundation, are actively scouring the internet for these images and notifying 
online platforms so they can be promptly removed. Sadly, most victims aren’t 
aware of these ongoing efforts to reduce the availability of online child sexual 
abuse material. When told about these initiatives, survivors expressed gratitude for 
these advances in technology and feel a sense of renewed hope for the future and 
a reduction in the distribution of their images.
The challenge for electronic service providers or NGOs will be alerting the overall 
population of victims to these advances in technology, as many of these 
organizations lack direct contact with the survivors. Therefore, informed mental 
health practitioners may offer the most hope to victims, raising awareness about 
these existing resources and programs to remove illegal images.
TAKEAWAYS
• Helping a survivor navigate feelings of loss of control in a therapeutic 
environment is a key component of healing for this population.
• Respect the fear, but help properly frame it.
• Learn about the legal and ethical concerns regarding survivors 
who desire to seek out their abusive material online.
• Educate yourself and your clients about the successful global initiatives 
by online tech companies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) 
to help remove child sexual abuse material from the internet.…There is a lot I don’t remember, 
but now I can’t forget because the 
disgusting images of what he did to me 
are still out there on the Internet.
It hurts me to know someone is 
looking at them – at me – when I 
was just a little girl being abused 
for the camera. I did not choose 
to be there, but now I am there 
forever in pictures that people are 
using to do sick things. I want it all 
erased. I want it all stopped. But 
I am powerless to stop it just like 
I was powerless to stop my uncle.
VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTCopyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma12
Effects of Legal Notifications
A unique consideration, which must be addressed is the notification process for 
victims of child sexual abuse material which is mandated under the U.S. Victims’ 
Rights and Restitution Act (34 U.S.C. §20141) and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act 
(18 U.S.C. §3771). Under these acts, survivors are afforded the right to be notified, 
or not notified, each time their images or videos are seen in a federal child sexual 
exploitation case. Notifications of this nature are handled by the U.S. Department 
of Justice under the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Victim Services Division’s 
Child Pornography Victim Assistance Program.
Survivors are advised by the U.S. Department of Justice, if they choose to be 
notified every time one of their sex abuse images appears in an investigation and/
or court proceeding, “you may start to receive a large number of notifications.”5 
Throughout one singular case, multiple notifications can be received about each 
investigative or prosecutorial phase. Compounding this, survivors whose images 
are distributed widely online may receive notifications about multiple cases under 
prosecution at the same time. These notifications are often used to assist in 
collecting restitution for the victim.
Practitioners recognized these notifications often retraumatize the survivor and 
increase fear about the scope and scale of the trading/distribution/possession of 
their abusive material throughout their lives. There is no other crime type like this 
– the possession and distribution  of child sexual abuse material – that revictimizes 
the survivor through new criminal acts, and new notifications of those crimes.
Without perspective, mental health practitioners are left underinformed as to 
the nature and scope of their client’s case. In addition, the complexity of the 
federal notification system may overwhelm a survivor. Conversely, the lack of state 
implemented notification parameters creates additional knowledge gaps in the size 
and level of distribution of the survivor’s images or videos.
Clearly, more collaboration and information sharing with law enforcement or NGOs 
tracking the distribution of images will help inform and provide context about 
the proliferation of an individual’s imagery online. Enhancing clinicians’ working 
relationships with other organizations, such as NCMEC and the U.S. Department of 
Justice’s Victim Services Division Child Pornographic Victim Assistance Program, will 
be extremely beneficial to the survivor in the long run.
It is important to highlight the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim 
Assistance Act of 2018,6 which was enacted in December 2018. The Act creates 
mandatory minimums for restitution for victims of child sexual abuse material 
distribution, establishes a victim compensation fund and defined monetary 
assistance for new victims. While as of this writing the funds have yet to be

appropriated and the application process yet to be established, this Act is a 
significant step in the ability for survivors to seek restitution that can be used for 
mental health and other services.
Support Systems
It is important to help clients rebuild or maintain confidence and self-esteem as well 
as work on survivors’ thoughts and cognitive restructuring of fears. The therapeutic 
relationship should be used as a model for other relationships by being consistent 
and trustworthy. Additionally, it can be the basis for building or rebuilding trusting 
relationships with other support systems in the survivor’s life. Some suggestions 
included identifying and developing self-soothing techniques and empowering 
clients to share those techniques with family/support systems.
The roundtable attendees explored how to support the nonoffending family 
members’ understanding of the impact of abuse and sexual exploitation. In 1998, 
the U.S. Department of Justice brought together a small group of parents to learn 
about the personal impact of having a missing or exploited child on their own 
mental health, family functioning and access to support. This initial gathering grew 
into NCMEC’s Team HOPE7 program.
Team HOPE serves as a model for peer support for parents, caretakers and 
extended family members. 
Team HOPE is a volunteer-
based program of NCMEC 
consisting of individuals who have 
demonstrated incredible resilience 
in turning personal tragedies into 
vital support for other families.

TAKEAWAYS
• Educate yourselves about the legal remedies available to your clients.
• Seek opportunities for appropriate information sharing 
with other professionals supporting the client such as 
victim advocates, law enforcement, and NGOs.
• Recognize many survivors will report additional trauma associated with 
the notification process, and this is a treatment issue requiring the 
recognition of triggers and development of appropriate coping skills.
Team HOPE has truly 
been a blessing in my life. 
Having a child who has 
been exploited, you feel so 
alone. Knowing that there 
is someone out there …

family to support. This support includes:
8 Per Susan P . Kemp, et al. in “Engaging parents in child welfare services: Bridging family needs and child welfare 
mandates” within Child Welfare,  Volume 88, Number 1, 2009, “Peer-to-peer programs are increasingly a focus 
of child welfare services …. This type of approach has shown to increase parent retention. Furthermore, some 
reports show … families engaged in mutual support experienced fewer negative outcomes and increased 
positive outcomes, such as positive changes to their self-esteem and perceived ability to cope with challenges, 
and higher levels of social support.”• Helping families in crisis with a 
sexually exploited child as they 
handle the day-to-day issues of 
coping with the circumstances 
their family is facing.
• Providing peer and emotional 
support, compassion, coping tools 
and empowerment to families 
with sexually exploited children.• Instilling courage, determination 
and hope in parents and 
other family members.
• Alleviating the feelings of 
isolation so often resulting 
from fear and frustration.
Research8 shows peer-based models of support have an overall positive effect 
on the population served, instilling hope, dispelling myths, providing education 
and resources, and breaking down barriers of experience and understanding. 
For survivors of child sexual abuse material, feeling less isolated and more 
empowered can only enhance any clinically based treatment plan developed with 
a mental health professional. As part of NCMEC’s work with the various helping 
professionals through these roundtables, NCMEC plans to engage the survivor 
population with the goal of growing the network of survivors who support each 
other and provide hope and strength to those in similar life experiences.
Creating a support network for survivors is the next step. Both research and the 
mental health practitioners support this need. NCMEC’s Team HOPE program is a 
model of success for this type of support and could integrate this population into 
its already existing peer support program.
TAKEAWAYS
• Model healthy relationships by building trust and consistency with clients.
• Connect clients with support systems to supplement therapeutic 
relationships (e.g. peer support through NCMEC’s Team HOPE program).Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma15
Survivor Exposure to Their Images in Disclosures and Investigations
A highly debated topic is the disclosure of the sexual abuse and the production of 
images and videos, as well as the complexities surrounding this issue. In addition, 
the use of images and videos during forensic interviews and within law enforcement 
investigations as a method to prompt disclosure is often discussed in the community.
While this roundtable did not include forensic interviewers and investigators 
to share insight into the use of imagery in disclosures, participants agreed this 
method could cause harm for a victim and specifically cited dissociative symptoms 
as a result. Survivors should be allowed the space to disclose in their own time. 
Creating a multidisciplinary team among law enforcement investigators, child 
advocacy centers and clinicians treating survivors may advance a dialogue to 
better understand the unique needs, purposes and uses of exposing a survivor to 
their imagery and to address the long-term treatment and therapeutic concerns 
of this action. Collaboration between professional populations may shine a light 
on new methodology to address the investigative and treatment models when 
working with the survivor.
The subject of images and videos should be raised in the context of interviewing 
and treatment for all child sexual abuse, even when law enforcement is not aware 
of the documentation of the abuse. In addition, if the knowledge of images and 
videos is known by professionals and the case will be adjudicated, imagery should 
be discussed sooner rather than later in treatment. As some practitioners indicated, 
many clients are simply waiting for the treatment provider to broach the subject.
Body Image, Sexuality and Aging
As we discussed, survivors have shared significant trauma symptoms related to the 
child sexual abuse they suffered and continued trauma responses related to the 
trading and distribution of images and videos.
Body image issues can emerge within this population, and intervention techniques 
were discussed to best address this concern. While research and treatment 
recommendations for child sexual abuse cases have proven effective for this 
TAKEAWAYS
• Consult victim advocates, child advocacy center interviewers and 
mental health clinicians prior to law enforcement showing victims 
their abusive imagery to assess potential traumatic impact.
• Establish multidisciplinary relationships among law enforcement, 
child advocacy centers and mental health providers.
• Ask clients whether their sexual abuse was filmed. Many 
clients do not disclose the existence of images of their 
abuse. Some are waiting to be directly asked.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma16
population, this group of practitioners acknowledged the added trauma of 
memorializing and distributing the abuse through images creates additional layers 
of victimization to consider.
Survivors of child sexual abuse indicate they were often shown images or videos of 
other children in sexual acts; a technique used to normalize the offender’s actions 
and desensitize the child victim to the abuse. Victims may re-imagine their own 
images and abuse through the sexualized eyes of their offender and a multitude of 
unknown offenders worldwide. This reframing of their sexuality, sexual worth and 
sexual norms is magnified because of their exposure to images of other victims 
and the production of their own imagery. In addition, victims carry the additional 
trauma that the imagery of their own abuse is weaponized against other children 
as a grooming technique. Victims fear their sexual abuse material will be used to 
manipulate other children, and indirectly contribute to the abuse of more children.
Several practitioners shared techniques that involved working with a client to 
perform physical movement exercises, such as trauma-informed yoga, to help 
minimize the body’s trauma-responses, and also to view the body in a more positive 
light. Working with a client around grief and loss triggers was suggested as a 
technique to help the client grieve the loss of self and then establish an identity 
outside of the victim label.
Aging presented a unique challenge. Specifically for those victimized as young 
children, survivors disclosed feelings of disgust and shame about entering puberty. 
Again, this population’s learned definition of sexuality comes from being shown 
child sexual abuse material and knowing images of their documented child sexual 
abuse are being viewed by others for sexual pleasure. Their perspective of sexuality 
may be connected to the value placed on the attributes of their prepubescent 
body, therefore going through puberty and developmental changes could result in 
cognitive dissonance and potential identity ruptures. Practitioners discussed ways 
to approach the potential impact the abuse has on sexuality as survivors may be 
stuck in defining their own sexuality from the lens of trauma.
The focus of therapy should be on self-worth, self-love and rebuilding the survivor’s 
sense of identity to work toward having healthy relationships and boundaries. 
Additionally, therapists need to provide psychoeducation about automatic body 
responses during sexual abuse and normalize affection through cognitive reframing. 
It’s important to explain healthy sexual behaviors in the context of celebrating a 
loving relationship versus keeping secrets and feeling shame.
TAKEAWAYS
• Many survivors fear images of their abuse are being 
used to groom other children for sexual abuse.
• Physical exercise may help refocus body issues in positive ways.
• Normal puberty changes may trigger issues relating to body acceptance.
• Cognitive reframing may help normalize affection.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma17
News Media
The role of other professions can significantly help or harm work in the post-
traumatic growth of a survivor. Media reports can sensationalize the sexual assault 
of children. Graphic descriptions of sexual acts are sometimes made in news 
reports, thus alerting neighbors and the local community to details of the abuse 
and creating possible safety concerns. By reporting too many demographic details 
about the offender, the media inadvertently puts the victim at risk of being located 
by zealous collectors of child sexual abuse material, causing additional layers of 
trauma. In some cases, details of the abusive acts are made public even before 
the child has processed it with law enforcement or a therapist. These children are 
often subjected to shame and embarrassment by their peers and other community 
members when details of their sexual assault are published in media pieces. 
Practitioners note survivors reported additional layers of discomfort and fear 
around media coverage, as the use of cameras or videotaping was part of their 
victimization. It was agreed additional sensitivity training for members of the media 
who report these types of crimes is clearly needed.
It is important to remember, although the crime might be described as “child 
pornography,” these are sexual assault crimes and the victims deserve the same 
level of privacy as any other sexual assault victim.
TAKEAWAYS
• Media exposure in these kinds of cases can create 
additional layers of trauma for survivors.
• Working together to inform law enforcement and media of 
these consequences can help sensitize those who report 
on these cases to minimize harm to the victim.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma18
NEXT STEPS
After experts spent three days debating this complicated and delicate subject 
matter at the NCMEC’s Mental Health Roundtable, the group noted, in some ways, 
they came away with more questions than solid answers. The complex and detailed 
nature of the issue, compounded with the lack of empirical research, meant with 
each topic and new idea, there were more questions. We recognize this discussion 
simply scratched the surface and more work needs to be done. Additional 
considerations for research and responses from more diverse survivor populations 
also requires further attention.
NCMEC is committed to working with leaders in the various professions 
identified in the Continuum of Care model to help develop robust practices for 
implementation. We seek to identify and partner with supporting organizations that 
will help create and disseminate guidelines for mental health practitioners to better 
address the specific needs of survivors. It’s also vital to expand training for clinicians 
to better identify and implement effective, sound and ethical treatment techniques.
NCMEC has identified key child-serving populations in which improvements can 
be made to increase and advance service delivery for victims. The Mental Health 
Practitioners’ Roundtable was the starting point, but just one area on which to 
focus. Another roundtable was held with attorneys in March 2019 with the goal 
of developing an attorney handbook regarding restitution, building a network of 
attorneys and identifying other legal remedies for these survivors. To continue 
driving change and improvements, NCMEC will host additional roundtables for 
other professional groups throughout 2019 and 2020.
In each phase of this project, the NCMEC team will refer to the work of the Phoenix 
11 and the results of the International Survivor’s Survey  to guide and direct the 
process. NCMEC’s role is to convene each professional group to discuss the 
individual discipline’s needs and concerns, then convene a multidisciplinary team, 
including family and survivor perspectives, to demonstrate the Continuum of Care 
model. Our goal is to help ensure a response as diverse as the population itself. 
With more than 35 years of experience supporting families and professionals in the 
field, NCMEC stands on its survivor-informed foundation to continue learning how 
we can improve service delivery by all child-serving professionals.
TAKEAWAYS
• Reinforce that many child protection professionals 
devote their careers to help remove these images from 
the internet and bring offenders to justice.
• Seek perspectives from a more diverse survivor population to 
help ensure further improvements in supportive services.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma19
MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONER RECOMMENDATIONS
A Different Kind of Trauma
• More research is needed about the differences between child 
sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material, specifically the unique 
trauma production and trading of imagery has on the survivor.
• Targeted education and training are critical for mental health practitioners.
How to Help These Survivors
• Assist clients in connecting with other clinicians.
• Surround clients with healthy influences.
• Consider multiple treatment modalities.
• Measure progress.
Loss of Control
• Helping a survivor navigate feelings of loss of control in a therapeutic 
environment is a key component of healing for this population. 
• Respect the fear, but help properly frame it.
• Learn about the legal and ethical concerns regarding survivors 
who desire to seek out their abusive material online. 
• Educate yourself and your clients about the ongoing global 
initiatives by online tech companies and NGOs to remove 
child sexual abuse material from the internet.
Effects of Legal Notifications
• Educate yourselves about the legal remedies available to your clients.
• Seek opportunities for appropriate information sharing with other professionals 
supporting clients such as victim advocates, law enforcement and NGOs.
• Recognize many survivors will report additional trauma associated with 
the notification process, and this is a treatment issue requiring the 
recognition of triggers and development of appropriate coping skills.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma20
Support Systems
• Model healthy relationships by building trust and consistency with clients.
• Connect clients with support systems to supplement therapeutic 
relationships (e.g. peer support through NCMEC’s Team HOPE program).
Survivor Exposure to Their Images in Disclosures and Investigations
• Consult victim advocates, child advocacy center interviewers and 
mental health clinicians prior to law enforcement showing victims 
their abusive imagery to assess potential traumatic impact.
• Establish multidisciplinary relationships among law enforcement, 
child advocacy centers and mental health providers.
• Ask clients whether their sexual abuse was filmed. Many clients do not disclose 
the existence of images of their abuse. Some are waiting to be directly asked.
Body Image, Sexuality and Aging
• Many survivors fear images of their abuse are being used 
to groom other children for sexual abuse.
• Physical exercise may help refocus body issues in positive ways.
• Normal puberty changes may trigger issues relating to body acceptance.
• Cognitive reframing may help normalize affection.
News Media
• Media exposure in these kinds of cases can create 
additional layers of trauma for survivors.
• Working together to inform law enforcement and media of 
these consequences can help sensitize those who report 
on these cases to minimize harm to the victim.
Next Steps
• Reinforce that many child protection professionals devote their careers to help 
remove of these images from the internet and bring offenders to justice.
• Seek perspectives from a more diverse survivor population to 
help ensure further improvement in supportive services.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma21
EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
• NCMEC will host a series of roundtables to convene child-serving professionals 
to share knowledge and experience to improve gaps in service delivery.
• NCMEC will expand its network of mental health clinicians to 
include specially trained providers for this population.
• NCMEC will seek to partner with clinicians and professional organizations to 
explore opportunities to educate about this topic and develop training and 
curriculum for mental health professionals directly related to this population 
to best support practitioner adoption of the recommendations noted above.
• NCMEC will continue to engage the Phoenix 11 and other survivor groups 
to share progress, gather feedback about future roundtable groups and 
determine what role NCMEC can play in improving survivor-centric services.
• NCMEC will integrate survivor support into the Team HOPE program.
• NCMEC will tailor media messaging and resource materials to 
speak directly to survivors and gather feedback and insight from 
the survivor and family communities to guide messaging.
We thank everyone who shared their time and experience with us:  
the facilitators who led this group through complex topics and 
sessions and, most importantly, the survivor advocate who shared 
her personal journey as a victim of child sexual abuse material.Copyright © 2019 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. All rights reserved.Captured on Film: Survivors of Child Sex Abuse Material are Stuck in a Unique Cycle of Trauma22

APPENDIX TABLE OF CONTENTS
Appendix A: Therapy with Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse Image 24Therapy With Survivors 
of Child Sexual Abuse Images
A summary created by the Phoenix 11, based on their own experiences
Difficulties:
Shock Factor: 
Therapists often cry or otherwise react with strong emotions when survivors start to open up. Survivors feel 
the need to comfort or protect therapists over having their own needs met. They feel that they cannot really 
open up and can only share surface details. Some therapists react strongly to the surface details, leaving 
survivors to wonder how they can share the worst of what they went through with anybody.
Expressing Experience Verbally: 
It is so hard to find the words to describe such an intense experience. Some survivors do not feel that they 
have the vocabulary to adequately express it, or that no words could.
Establishing Trust with Therapist: 
Survivors worry about the consequences of opening up to a therapist. They worry about being judged for parts 
of their story. They worry that they will not be seen as trustworthy people for times they may have gone along 
with things, lied, or done other things to survive that some people might find questionable. Some survivors 
also see the therapist as a friend in what is a very lonely situation. For this reason, they hesitate to share 
certain details that they fear might threaten that relationship.
Caseload Size: 
Some survivors experienced therapists who had large caseloads and were not able to give them the attention 
required for their intense needs. Some of these therapists would need refreshers at the beginning of each 
visit on what the client’s needs were and did not have a clear treatment plan. Survivors need therapists who 
really get to know them and their stories and who go over notes before each appointment and come prepared 
with a plan or direction. For this reason, survivors may require therapists with smaller caseloads who are 
able to give them more individualized attention.
Therapist Lacks Training: 
Many survivors experienced therapists who did not know what to do to help them. Survivors agree that 
treating them like a client who experienced sexual abuse alone is not effective because it does not address 
the other complicated symptoms of their ongoing trauma. Survivors need therapists who have training in 
working with complicated trauma and address issues holistically.24Therapist is Too Directive and Rigid: 
A few of the survivors experienced therapists that were too rigid and made them feel controlled or shamed. 
One therapist required the client to journal everyday, but the client had difficulty completing the journaling 
because it caused such great anxiety. When the client explained to the therapist why the homework was not 
completed, the therapist refused to see the client. This caused further harm to the client and made going to 
therapy that much more of a challenge. Therapists who work with survivors need to be flexible, really listen to 
client needs, and work collaboratively with the client to find interventions that will be helpful and not harmful.
Issues Survivors Have Difficulty Resolving 
With Current Therapy:
Nightmares: 
All of the survivors still struggle with nightmares and 9 out of 10 survivors struggle with insomnia. Therapy 
has not resolved these issues, despite some of the survivors being in therapy for several years.
Aging/Body Image: 
Survivors were taught by their abusers that their young, childlike bodies were beautiful and more desirable 
than older bodies. This cognitive distortion can cause additional distress about the aging process and body 
changes related to age, childbearing, and health issues.
Employment Issues: 
Many survivors have experienced difficulty working in service types of jobs that inv olve random people 
coming, going, and approaching them, such as retail or food service. Many survivors have quit a new job 
within the first week because of panic attacks. Some survivors feel conflicted between disclosing about their 
PTSD to their boss , to help them understand and work with them, or pro tecting their privacy and dealing with 
the consequences of appearing “flaky.” Many survivors find it difficult to go to work on certain days when  
PTSD symptoms are worse and will call in sick on these days. For some survivors, working outside of their 
home has been too difficult at times because of anxiety, and it feels like a disability.
School Issues: 
Difficulty concentrating in school because of court going on, classmates recognizing from media, or social 
anxiety in general (wondering if classmates have seen image, are safe people) can lead them to drop in 
grades despite ability. These things also make it hard to attend class. Some survivors have found online 
school to be more doable. However, online sch ool also means speaking to peopl e online that are strangers, 
which can be another source of anxiety.
25Identity Issues: 
Survivors struggle to form a new identity after their story is disclosed. Many adults find parts of their identity 
in work, their education, or their relationships, but all of these things can be challenging in different ways for 
survivors. They may feel that they lack an identity they can talk about openly if they are not able to answer 
simple questions like, “What do you do for a living?” They may feel shame for where they are at in life and feel 
like they are so far behind their peers. If they do disclose to others, they are worried that they will be treated 
differently and always seen as a victim or defined by their traumatic story. Survivors need support in forming 
new identities apart from their trauma and learning how to talk about themselves in a positive way with others.
Social Anxiety: 
The social anxiety of survivors needs to be treated differently than regular social anxiety because it stems 
from a different cause. There may be many reasons for a survivor to experience social anxiety, and these 
would be best treated in an individualized way for each survivor.
Sexuality:
Survivors may struggle with sexuality in their adult relationships, either learning to be comfortable with 
their own sexuality, communicating about sex with their partner (what they need & what they do not like), 
and responding to their partner. They may struggle to connect emotionally during sex or may find their body 
trying to disconnect and shut down. It can be confusing for their partners because they may be fine with 
something one day and averse to it the next. They may also be extra sensitive to and hurt/angered by the use 
of pornography by their partner.
Online Presence:
Most of the survivors felt that they had to be cautious with their online presence.  Many use variations of their 
name, rather than their actual name online to protect themselves from being approach by pedophiles who 
have seen their images or others who might troll them because of what has been written about them in the 
media. Survivors need to be careful about their privacy settings on social media. They may also need help 
dealing with the loss they feel for not being able to use social media as openly as their peers and missing out 
on things because of that.
Dissociation: 
Survivors may often lose track of time, zone out, and get stuck in thoughts that we cannot remember as 
soon as we snap out of it. Even as we recover from the other symptoms of PTSD, we may still struggle with 
dissociating in the small, quiet moments of our day.
26What Survivors Need Therapists to Understand:
•We have difficulty having empathy for ourselves. It is easy to care about others first and neglect ourselves.
We will reject ourselves before others reject us.
•We are lonely. Our experience is unique and makes us feel set apart from others.
•We require a unique approach. Our issues are more complicated than the abuse we experienced as children.
•Our identity has been mes sed with by our abusers and those who have viewed our images online. We need
helping forming a new cohesive identity apart from our trauma. Difficulties with school or work make it
harder to form a new identity.
•Opening up t o friends or significant others about our traumatic past or the images of it is a huge step that
we may need support with. 
•Sex and sexuality are complicated for us and we may need help navigating that. Sometimes we are afraid
to be sexy. It is difficult to trust others enough to be vulnerable. We will probably have good days and bad 
days in this area and need support to form healthy patterns.
•Having childr en or even thinking about having children brings up a whole new layer of issues for us. It may
require re-doing some work on our trauma in a new context. There may be a lot of fear about bringing
children into the kind of world where such traumatic things can happen to children. We may worry
constantly about the safety of children in our life and act in ways that are hypervigilant and exhausting,
such as refusing to let other people watch our children. Seeing our children in certain normal situations
can trigger painful memories. We may be especially triggered by cameras around children.
Interesting Things Survivors of  
Child Sexual Abuse Images Had in Common:
•Most of us put off dating till late high school or after high school.
•Most of us have only had between 1-3 significant others.
•Most of us have dogs and find animals very comforting. They make us feel safe and less lonely. They never
judge us. We can tell them anything.
•We all have had difficulties with employment because of anxiety and other PTSD symptoms.
•Most of us experienced difficulties with school because of anxiety and other PTSD symptoms, and some of
us have found online school to be the better option.
•Most of us have had a negative experience with the media that made us feel exploited all over again.
•Most of us have triggers or worries related to kids, even those of us who have kids. E.g. “What if we have
abuser DNA that we pass on to our kids?”,  “What if we develop inappropriate thoughts towards kids at
some point?”,  seeing pictures of friend’s kids in the bath on social media causes anxiety, etc.
•Most of us had fears about appearing “sexy” that affect the way we dress and our presence on social media.
•Many of us w ere worried about being “compared to each other” before we met.
•We all have really vivid and highly detailed dreams. Many of us have lucid dreams. Many of us struggle with
recurring nightmares.
