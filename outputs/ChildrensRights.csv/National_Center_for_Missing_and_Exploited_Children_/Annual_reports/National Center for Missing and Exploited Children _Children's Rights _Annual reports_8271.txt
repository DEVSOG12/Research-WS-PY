Dear Friends,
It’s been a remarkable year of transition and 
transformation in our storied 34-year history. 
We have a new home! Our new state-of-the-
art headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia will 
enhance our ability to harness technology in 
our quest to bring missing children home and 
keep our nation’s children safer.
I’m thrilled to say that thanks to our generous 
partners, better training and advancements 
in technology, more missing children are 
coming home safely today than ever before. 
But, sadly, in this age of the internet, crimes 
against children have literally gone viral, and we need your help 
now more than ever.
Last year alone, our CyberTipline received a record 18.4 million 
reports of suspected child sexual exploitation. The good news 
– and there is good news – is that the CyberTipline gives us a 
unique lens into who these children are and how they’re being 
sexually exploited. This information and experience enables us 
to help law enforcement rescue these children and shape our 
prevention programs.
Since 1984, our nonprofit organization has been on the 
forefront of child protection, but we still have a lot of work to 
do. Please join us in our vitally important mission. Every child 
deserves a safe childhood!
