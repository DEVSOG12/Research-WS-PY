 
Trends identified in CyberTipline sextortion reports  
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s CyberTipline receives reports 
regarding child  sexual exploitation , including  “sextortion”.   Sextortion  is a relatively new form 
of sexual exploitation that occurs primarily online and in which  non-physical forms of coercion  
are utilized , such as blackmail , to acquire sexual content (photos/videos) of the child, obtain 
money from the child or engage in sex with the child .   
Since the CyberTipline  began tracking  sextortion in October 2013 , these reports have been on 
the rise .  In just the first two full years, between 2014 and 2015, t here was a 90% increase in the 
total number of reports ; a pattern that has continu ed, with sextortion reports up 150% within the 
first several months of 2016 compared to the number of reports in that  same time -frame in 2014 .   
To review this increasing form of sexual victimization in greater  depth, NCMEC analyzed the 
CyberTipline sextortion reports received between  October 2013 through April 2016  (n=1,428 ) 
and found the following results regarding the child victims, the reporters to the CyberTipline and 
the offenders ’ behaviors : 
Who are the child victims?  
 78% of the reports  involved  female children  and 15% involved male children ( In 8% of 
reports , child gender could not be determined ). 
 Male and female children  each ranged in age from 8 -17 years old and had an average age 
of fifte en years old ; however, compared to female children, it was less common for male 
children to be on the younger end of the spectrum . 
 In 24% of  the reports , reporter s mentioned that they suspected or knew  that additional 
child ren were targeted by the same offender.  
Who are making the reports to the CyberTipline?  
 Overall, I nternet companies were the most common reporter of sextortion to the 
CyberTipline (33%), followed by the child victims (24%) and parents/guardians (22%).  
However, almost half  of Internet company reports made to the CyberTipline were known 
to have originated as self -reports , making  the child victims the most common direct or 
indirect reporter  of sextortion incidents  that were ultimately processed by the 
CyberTipline (38%).  
o Other reporter s to the CyberTipline  included peers (e.g. friends, romantic 
partners, siblings; 7%), authority figures (e.g. police, teachers, counselors; 5%) 
and online strangers to the child (3%) . 
 Despite these overall patterns, important child  gender and  age differences emerged : 
o While male children  were significantly more likely than female children to self -
report, female children were significantly more likely than male children  to have 
Internet compan ies and peers report on their behalf .  Parents/guardi ans and other 
authority figures were equally likely to report for male and female children.  
o While self - and Internet company -reports were more likely among older children, 
parent/guardian -, authority figure - and online stranger -reports were more likely 
among younger children .  Peers were  equally likely to report for  older and 
younger children.  
Where, when , how and why  is sextortion occur ring? 
Where?  
 Sextortion most commonly occur red via phone/tablet messaging apps , social networking 
sites and video chats . 
 Of the reports in which an online location was mentioned, the total number of platforms 
that offenders used to communicate  with children ranged widely  from one platform to as 
many as seven platforms .  While over half of reports (56%) indicated that only one 
platform was involved, the use of multiple platforms was indicated i n 42% of the reports .  
When communication occurred across multiple online locations, a common pattern  
emerged where by the  offender would intentionally  and systematically  move  the 
commu nication  with the child from  one online platform  type to another . 
o In a typical incident  involving multiple platforms , the offender approache d the 
child on a social networking site  where they learn ed personal information about 
the child, such as who their family and friends are or where they go to school.  
The offender  then attempt ed to move  the communication to an anonymous 
messaging app or live-stream video chat  where they obtain ed sexual ly explicit  
content from the child.  These images and/or videos  were then used  as blackmail 
against the child , such as by threatening to post the explicit content of the child on 
those same social networking sites  for their family and friends to see unless the 
child produce d additional sexually explicit content, paid them money or met them 
in person for sex . 
When?  
 In 39% of incidents, there was  enough  information to determine the waiting period 
between the time the offender acquired the sexually explicit content of the child and the time they blackmailed them with it .  Of the cases in which it was known, most ( 80%) 
appeared to occur the same day.  However, 20% of  these reports  indicated prolonged 
waiting periods before the child was blackmailed  with the acquired content; in some 
cases, as long as years lat er.   
o When the blackmail was delayed for an exten ded period of time, it appeared to 
commonly cause the child confusion, such as not remembering even taking the 
picture or, if they did remember taking it, not understanding how the offender 
could have acquired it from  their online  account or from “someone else”  who was 
initially given the image.  
 
How?  
 Many different manipulation t actics were used by offenders , often in combination,  to 
achieve their apparent objectives .  The mo st common tactic that reporters indicated were 
the offender threaten ing to post  previously acquired sexual  content online  (67%) and, 
often, specifically  threatening to post it in a place for  family  and friends to see (29%) if 
the child did not comply . 
 Other tactics used  by the offenders  include : 
o Reciprocation, whereby the offender coerced the child into providing sexual 
content by promising reciprocity  (“I’ll show you if you show me”)  
o Developing a bond by establishing a friendship/romantic relationship  
o Secretly recording sexually explicit videos of the child during video chats  
o Physically threatening to hurt or sexually assault the child or family members  
o Using multiple online identities against a given child, such as the person 
blackmailing for sexual content as well as pretending to be a supportive friend or 
a sympathetic victim of the same offender  
o Pretending to be younger and/or a female  
o Accessi ng the child’s online account without authorization and stealing sexual 
content of the child  
o Threatening to create sexual content of the child using digital -editing tools  to 
merge the child’s face with another person’s body  
o Threatening to commit suicide if  the child does not provide sexual content  
o Creating a fake profile as the child and threatening to post sexual  content  of the 
child  
o Initially offering something to the child, such as money or drugs, in exchange for 
sexual explicit photos/videos  
o Pretending to work for a modeling agency to obtain sexual content of the child  
o Saving sexually explicit conversations with the child and threatening to post them 
online   While  the majority of these manipulation tactics were used equally against 
male and female childre n, there were significant d ifferences in the use of 
certain methods . More specifically, when child victims were male, 
offenders were significantly more likely to pretend to be younger  and/or a 
female , offer to engage in sexual reciproc ity through shared im ages or by 
live-streaming , record the child unknowingly and then threaten to post the 
images/videos so family and friends c ould see.  In contrast, when child 
victims were female, offenders were significantly more likely to offer 
something  to get initial sexually explicit content from them , such as 
money  or drugs . 
Why?  
 Based on the information that was indicated or known when the CyberTipline report was 
made, offenders appeared to have committed sextortion with one of three primary 
objectives  (In 2% of the se reports, multiple objectives were indicated; in  11% of reports, 
the objective could not be determined):  
1. To acquire increasingly more explicit sexual content (photos/videos) of the child 
(78%)  
 Female children were blackmailed significantly more often for sexually 
explicit content (84%) compared  to male children (53%) . 
 When sexually explicit content was the apparent objective, offenders 
commonly escalate d in their demands, both in the quantity of  
images/videos and/or in the level of egregiousness.  It was not uncommon 
for children to believe that complying would make the blackmail  stop.  In 
some extreme instances, reports indicated that the sextortion had escalated 
to the child being blackmailed f or videos of a certain length while 
performing specific  sexually explicit behaviors and sometimes  for the 
child to even include other children, such as siblings or peers, in the 
images/videos.  
2. To obtain money or goods from the child (7%)  
 Male children were  blackmailed significantly more often for money/goods 
(32%) compared to female children (2%)  
 When money/goods were the apparent objective, offenders commonly 
demanded for money to be sent via a money transfer service or online 
payment system.  It was also increasingly common for offenders to try to 
get credit card information, either directly or by having the child sign up 
for a particular website that required them to enter that information.  Less 
commonly, offenders sometimes demanded other payments or go ods, such 
as game currency, cell phones or clothing.  
3. To have sex with the child (5%)   There was no statistically significant difference  between male (3%) and 
female (5%) children in the rate  that they were blackmailed to meet for 
sex. 
 In contrast to the maj ority of sextortion reports made to the CyberTipline, 
when sex was the apparent objective, there was more commonly an 
indication in the report that the offender might be someone that the child 
knows in person, such as an ex -boyfriend or other individual in their 
community.  However, when that was not the case and the offender 
seemed to want anonymity , demanding sex appeared to be a ploy t o 
achieve their real objective of acquiring sexually explicit content. In these 
reports, the offender first demanded sex and then subsequently demanded 
content instead, likely as a way to make their second demand appear as a 
relatively more desirable option  and increase the chances of compliance . 
What are the effects of sextortion?  
 As a result of sextortion, child victims co mmonly experienced a range of negative 
outcomes, including hopelessness, fear, anxiety and depression.  Overall, it was indicated 
in 13% of CyberTipline sextortion reports  that the child victim had experienced some 
type of  negative outcome.  Of th ose reports with some type of negative outcome , it was 
indicated that about  1 in 3 children  (31%; 4% of all sextortion reports)  had engaged in 
self-harm , threaten ed suicide or attempt ed suicide as a result of the victimization.  
o There were no child gender or  age differences in regard to negative outcomes; 
negative outcomes were indicated equally for m ale and female children as well as 
for younger and older children, even among the more severe outcomes.  
 Regardless of children’s gender or age, when it was indic ated in the report that the y had 
experienced a negative outcome as a result of the sextortion, it was also common that 
concern was expressed for other potential victims of sextortion and was  a likely reason 
for making the report.
