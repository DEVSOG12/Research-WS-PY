There are many groups working to remove CSAM 
from the internet and many others providing 
support and resources to affected children and 
families. By reporting these incidents, you can help 
many children and families.
If you or your child are exposed to CSAM online 
immediately report this to the National Center 
for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) 
at www.cybertipline.org . Reports may be 
made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Reporting 
these incidents to NCMEC is the first step in 
addressing the situation. Your report will allow law 
enforcement to start an investigation, help keep 
other children safe, and start the recovery process 
for you and your child.
To make a report of CSAM exposure online, please 
provide the following information:Reporting
Child Sexual 
Exploitation
1.  The username of the individual  
       sharing the explicit content,
2.  The date and time the content was 
       shared,
3.  The URL or meeting link where 
       content was shared, and
4.  The meeting number and password,  
       if applicable.
Please remember:  If you have CSAM on your 
computer or device, do not share content to 
help identify a child or to express outrage. 
This is illegal and can further victimize the 
child in the images. Everyone will react differently to CSAM exposure, and not all 
strategies for coping will work for everyone. Below are some 
suggestions of common ways to deal with your initial reactions 
to CSAM: 
1. Engage in positiv e activities:
a. Connection to others: talking to friends, reaching out to 
see if a neighbor needs help
b. Movement: walking, yoga, swimming, dance, sports, 
playing with your child
c. Creative Expression: art, drama, music, gardening
d. Connection to self: meditation, mindfulness, reading, writing
2. If the i mages are on your mind , try actively replacing that 
image with something that is more soothing and positive – 
focus on images that bring you comfort. 
3. Be intentional about looking after yourself for several 
weeks after exposure.  Consider checking in with yourself 
daily to see if you notice a change in your day-to-day behav -
ior, such as having trouble sleeping, disturbing and repeating 
nightmares, feeling easily agitated, or increased anxiety. 
4. Taking note of changes in your behavior allows you to 
best advocate for your wellbeing.  A trusted person who 
is close to you can also help you with identifying concern -
ing changes to your behavior. If your reactions become 
troublesome, resources are available to help you. For more 
information on how to find mental health guidance and 
referrals, please go to the National Child Traumatic Stress 
Network (NCTSN) website: www.nctsn.org/about-us/con -
tact-us/get-help-now . As this exposure has increased across 
the country, crisis hotlines are also available as a resource.      
For Children
With online schooling and other activities now virtual, children 
and youth are experiencing an unprecedented amount of time 
online and may be at risk for exposure to CSAM. Talk with your 
child about internet safety and specifically what to do if they 
see child sexual abuse images. There are resources available to 
help you.
Before you use an online platform or website, familiarize 
yourself with the privacy and safety settings, as well as reporting 
mechanisms. Review your own profiles to know what information 
is shared with the public. Ensure your settings are set to prevent 
unauthorized users from joining your video call or connecting 
with you on social media or online gaming. Talk with your school 
or other online community groups about what they are doing to 
ensure a safe online experience.
Exposure can be especially traumatic for children. The way in 
which you help a child cope will depend on their age, how the 
exposure happened, and their past experience with stressors or 
other traumas. Seeking professional assistance may be helpful for children who have had previous traumatic experi -
ences. Talking with your child directly is a good first 
step. The NCTSN has helpful resources to talk with your 
children, and below are some best practices:
1. Ask your child what happened. Listen and remain 
calm while they try to explain. Hearing that your 
child was exposed may upset you, but it is import -
ant to not avoid the conversation.
2. Pay attention to how your response is affecting 
your child’s response.  
3. Ask your child how they feel and be open to 
a range of responses. Offer reassurance and 
comfort if your child shows signs of distress such 
as worry or fear. Avoid asking your child direct 
questions repeatedly. 
4. Explain to your child that these crimes are report -
ed to officials  whose job it is to protect children, 
and this is the best way to help the child who is 
being hurt in the image. Tell your child there are 
people working to make sure all children are safe.  
5. Remind your child that they are safe  and will be 
safe moving forward.
6. Pay attention to your child’s behaviors and take 
notice of anything that seems different or con -
cerning.  If you or your child continue to be worried 
and are struggling to feel better after the exposure, 
seek additional help. Visit www.nctsn.org/audienc -
es/families-and-caregivers  for assistance and more 
information. 
7. Be prepared that your child may want to talk 
about the images several days, weeks or months 
later. Some children may want to have a conversa -
tion about what abuse and exploitation are and how 
they can be stopped. Use this time to discuss safety 
and remind your child of their personal safety rules, 
both online and offline. For resources about these 
topics visit www.missingkids.org/netsmartz  
8. Some children may be curious or confused, and 
these are normal responses. Teaching your child 
about sexual health is important. For more informa -
tion, please seek resources in your local community, 
and refer to the websites below:

babies to gender to consent to relationships

Sometimes legally referred to as child pornography, 
CSAM is the documented sexual abuse and 
exploitation of children. Unfortunately, children 
and adults can be exposed to these images 
and videos over the internet without warning or 
consent. Examples of this unwitting exposure 
include being shown a video during a hacked video 
conferencing webinar or being sent images over 
social media platforms.
CSAM exposure can be traumatic for you and your 
child. You may have feelings like shock, anger, 
sadness, and disgust at what you have seen. You 
may find it hard to get the image out of your 
head. You may experience nightmares, trouble 
concentrating, or forgetfulness about things that 
should be easy to remember. These are very 
common reactions that can disrupt your sense of 
safety. You are not alone! This guide outlines how 
to report CSAM to the appropriate authorities and 
the resources available to you and your family to 
better cope with this exposure.   Child Sexual Abuse
