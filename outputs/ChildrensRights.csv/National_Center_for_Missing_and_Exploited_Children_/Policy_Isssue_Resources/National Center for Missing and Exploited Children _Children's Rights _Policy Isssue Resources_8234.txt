 I. INTRODUCTION 
A. THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD 
ABDUCTION . 
The purpose of the first Manual, issued in 2007, was to provide attorn eys with a road map 
for litigating international child abduction cases.  Since the publication of the first Manual, the 
United States Supreme Court is sued its first opinion concer ning the Hague Convention on the 
Civil Aspects of International Child Abductio n, and more parties ha ve sought to resolve 
international abduction matters through alternative methods, incl uding mediation.  This updated 
Manual not only provides a general understanding of the law and its recent developments, but 
also describes practical considerations to aid atto rneys in advocating for their clients.  Finally, it 
raises issues and makes suggestions to ameliora te the potentially negative impact that these 
proceedings may have on the children involved in such disputes.1  As is evident in this Manual, 
representing a client in an international ab duction matter requires a balancing of various 
considerations. 
The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspe cts of International Child Abduction  (the 
“Hague Convention ”) (attached as Exhibit B ),2 is a treaty between multiple signatory countries 
wherein the countries agree to c ooperate in returning children to  their home country for custody 
proceedings.  The United States assisted in  drafting the Hague Convention and became a 
signatory in 1981.  Eighty-seve n countries throughout the worl d are parties to the Hague 
                                                 
1 For ease of reference, the cases cited throughout  this Manual are included in a list (attached as Exhibit 
A) organized by circuit of origin. 
2 October 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 22514 (the “Hague Convention”).  The Hague 
Convention was the product of the final act of the F ourteenth Session of the Hague Conference on Private 
International Law, agreed upon in The Hague on Oc tober 25, 1980.  At this session, each signatory 
country agreed to submit the Hague Convention draft to their governments.  See Hague Conference on 
Private International Law:  Final Act, reprinted in  19 I.L.M. 1501 (Am. Soc’t Int’l Law 1980). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 2 
 Convention, including most recently Russia, Mo rocco, and Singapore.  The signatories to the 
Hague Convention that are recognized by the United States are listed in Exhibit C .3 
The United States Congress enacted the International Child A bduction Remedies Act  
(“ICARA ”)4 as the implementing legislation fo r the Hague Convention.  A copy of ICARA , as 
currently codified, is attached as Exhibit D .  ICARA establishes the Hague Convention as the 
law of the United States, provides definitions, sets forth jurisdicti on, and addresses certain details 
regarding how the United States will enforce the provisions of the treaty.  ICARA explicitly states that its provisions ar e in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Hague Convention.

The State Department’s analysis of the Ha gue Convention is set forth in a document 
known as Public Notice 957  (attached as Exhibit E ).6   In addition, the hi story and commentary 
by the official reporter at the Fourteenth  Session of the Hague Convention on Private 
International Law is set forth in a document commonly known as the “P erez-Vera Report.”  A 
copy of the Perez-Vera Report  is attached as Exhibit F .7  Both Public Notice 957 and the Perez-
Vera Report provide insight in to the purposes and procedur es of the Hague Convention. 
 
                                                 
3 Although there are 87 contracting countries to the Ha gue Convention, at this time, the United States 
recognizes only 68 countries as “partner countries” for purposes of resolving international child 
abductions under the Hague Convention. 
4 Pub. L. No. 100-300, 102 Stat. 437 (1988)  (“ICARA ”).  ICARA  is codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 11601-
11611.  ICARA was created to deal with the international abduction of  children and to allow a petitioner 
to assert his or her rights in exigent circumstances.  See Distler v. Distler , 26 F. Supp. 2d 723, 727 (D.N.J. 
1998).

 B. THE ROLE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT & THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR 
MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN . 
On April 1, 2008, after the publication of the fi rst Manual, the State Department’s Office 
of Children’s Issues reassumed the United St ates’ Central Authority responsibilities in 
connection with incoming Hague Convention cases.  The Central Authority is a government- 
designated agency within each Hague Convention si gnatory country that handles child abduction 
issues.  Previously, the State Department dele gated these duties to The National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Child ren (“NCMEC”) under a Coopera tive Agreement with the 
Department of Justice and the State Depa rtment.  Although NCMEC no longer manages the 
incoming Central Authority functions, it continue s to provide technical assistance and resources 
to parents, law enforcement, and professiona ls who are working to prevent and resolve 
international abductions, incl uding through the publicati on of this updated Manual. 
Most Hague Convention actions follow a sim ilar factual and procedural path.  After a 
parent realizes that his or her child has been abducted to the United States, the parent exhausts all 
avenues within his or her home country to find the child.  The left-behind parent then informs the 
Central Authority within his or her home countr y.  The Central Authority works with the left-
behind parent to complete a set of documents (t he “Application”) to initiate the process for the 
return of, or access to, the child.  The Central Authority then fo rwards the Application and all 
supporting materials to the State Department. 
The State Department, with the aid of  both governmental and non-governmental 
agencies, including NCMEC, then begins the proce ss of locating the child in the United States by 
using school, employment, financial, social secu rity, police, postal, internet or other public 
records.  More information concerni ng this investigation is provided in Section IV.C.2  of this 
Manual. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 4 
 Once the State Department locates the child, if the left-behind parent requests pro bono  
legal representation based on the parent’s persona l assessment of eligibility under the Legal 
Services Corporation Poverty Guidelines,8 the State Department contacts attorneys in the 
International Child Abduction Attorney Network (“ICAAN”)9 to locate counsel who may be 
interested in providing represen tation.  The State Department provides potential counsel with 
basic information such as the c ountry involved and the gender of the potential client.  Counsel 
who consent to considering representation are in cluded on a list with their contact information, 
and the client is instructed to contact potential counsel. 
If counsel is interested in proceeding after having an initial call with the left-behind 
parent, the State Department will provide additio nal information such as the Application and 
custody documents.  If the Application is comple ted in the left-behind parent’s native language, 
the State Department will provide the fore ign language Applicati on and the translated 
Application to counsel.  The Applic ation serves as the initial sour ce of relevant details regarding 
the abduction.  After reviewing the materials, counsel will proceed w ith their independent 
representation of the left-behi nd parent in the Hague Conventi on litigation.  Once the client 
engages counsel and an engagement letter is si gned, the State Department  provides counsel with 
the entire file. 
                                                 
8 See 45 C.F.R. pt. 1611, App. A (2012) . 
9 Until April 2008, NCMEC ran the International Child Abduction Attorney Network (“ICAAN”) on 
behalf of the Department of State.  However, in April 2008, the U.S. Central Authority assumed primary 
responsibility for all “incoming” casework, including ope ration of the attorney network.  Attorneys who 
had signed up for ICAAN were invited to participate in  the U.S. Central Authority’s Attorney Network, 
and nearly all did.  Following the transition of incoming Central Authority duties to the Department of State, NCMEC has maintained its network but has broadened the role of ICAAN to provide 
representation in international (and domestic) family abduction matters of all kinds, includi ng both Hague 
and non-Hague matters.  See

 and 
http://travel.state.gov/abduction/atto rneysjudges/network/network_4936.html . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 5 
 NCMEC also provides legal technical assistan ce for attorneys at any point during the 
litigation.  This assistance incl udes discussing legal questions, referring attorneys to ICAAN 
mentors, discussing alternate legal strategies, arranging logistical suppor t, providing third party 
referrals for counseling and othe r support, and troubleshooting. 
C. OVERVIEW OF A HAGUE CONVENTION CASE. 
There are two types of Hague C onvention cases:  return and access.  This Manual focuses 
primarily on return cases unless otherwise noted.  In return cases the left-behind parent with 
custodial rights seeks the return of his or her ch ild to the child’s countr y of habitual residence.10  
In access cases, the left-behind parent seeks enfor cement of visitation rights to his or her child. 
In return cases, the Hague Convention mandates that cour ts should determine only the 
jurisdictional merits of  the case and should not evaluate an y underlying merits of the custody 
dispute.  Specifically, u nder the Hague Convention, co urts can determine only where  a child 
custody action should be tried.  Article 16  of the Hague Convention sp ecifically bars courts in 
countries to which children have been abducted fr om considering the merits  of custody once they 
receive notice of the wrongful rem oval or retention of the children.  All ci rcuits that have 
addressed this issue have followed th is mandate of the Hague Convention.11  When litigating a 
Hague Convention return action, c ounsel should be prepared to counter the defense’s or the 
court’s attempts to convert th e action into a custody proceedi ng.  More importantly, counsel 
should take every opportunity to remind the c ourt that a Hague Conve ntion case is purely 
                                                 
10 A return case arises when a ch ild is removed from his or her home country of habitual residence or 
wrongfully prohibited from returning to the country of habitual residence.  Both of these circumstances 
establish a legal basis for a return case and are used interchangeably th roughout this Manual. 
11 See, e.g. , Nicolson v. Pappalardo , 605 F.3d 100, 109 (1st Cir. 2010); Von Kennel Gaudin v. Remis ,282 
F.3d 1178, 1182 (9th Cir. 2002); Miller v. Miller , 240 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir. 2001); March v. Levine , 
249 F.3d 462, 472 (6th Cir. 2001); Diorinou v. Mezitis , 237 F.3d 133, 140 (2d Cir. 2001); England v.

 jurisdictional and is not intended to focus on the best interests of the child or other custody 
issues.  See Section III.F  for additional information on best interests of the child and Section 
IV.C  for additional information on litigation logistics. 
Both state and federal courts have jurisdic tion to hear Hague Convention return cases.12  
Thus, whether to file in federal or state court is  one of counsel’s first strategic decisions in a 
Hague Convention return case.13  Access cases, in which a left-behind parent seeks only to 
exercise access rights (as opposed to custodial ri ghts) to the child, can be filed only in state 
court.14 
Certain procedural issues of a Hague Convention case are sim ilar to those of a “typical” 
civil litigation matter.  The petition for return,15 like any other petition or complaint filed in 
federal court, must set forth the basis for the court’s jurisdiction, the general causes of action, 
and the relief sought by the left-behind parent.  A notice of motion or order to show cause often 
is filed simultaneously with the petition for return to request th at the court compel the abducting 
parent to attend a court proceeding and show why he or she should not return the child.  This 
filing also is intended to ensure that the abduct ing parent will not leave the court’s jurisdiction 
with the child. 
Other procedural issues are unique to Hague Convention ca ses.  One major procedural 
issue involves assessing the risk that the abduc ting parent, after being se rved with the petition, 
                                                 
12 42 U.S.C. § 11603(a)  (providing for concurrent jurisdiction in return cases). 
13 See Hague Convention, supra note 2 , infra Section IV.A.1 . 
14 Bromley v. Bromley , 30 F. Supp. 2d 857, 860 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (h olding that the “plain language of the 
Convention does not provide federal cour ts with jurisdiction over access rights”); Wiggill v. Janicki , 262 
F. Supp. 2d 687, 689 (S.D. W.Va. 2003) (“Federal courts  do not have jurisdiction to enforce rights of 
access under the Convention.”). 
15 The parties to a Hague Convention case are designate d as the petitioner (the left-behind parent) and the 
respondent (the abducting parent). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 7 
 will flee the jurisdiction with the child prior to the show cause hearing.  This risk may be 
minimized in a number of ways, including ha ving law enforcement place the child in the 
temporary custody of the left-behind parent (or Child Protective Services).  The potentially 
competing interests of due process and the secur ity and psychological safety  of the child provide 
challenges that are not typical in the average federal court proceeding.  Suggestions for handling these logistical issues follow in Section IV.C
. 
The hearing to show cause is the fi rst hearing in the action unless an ex parte  hearing has 
been held to request that the court remove the child from the abducting parent prior to or upon 
service.  The first hearing is a uni que opportunity for the petitioner’s attorney to advance the case 
and explain to the court why the petitioner is  seeking relief from the court under the Hague 
Convention.  It may be advisable at that time to provide to the court an explanation of the Hague 
Convention, how the child’s situ ation falls within the operative scope of the Hague Convention, 
the specific relief sought by the left-behind parent , and the scope of the court’s jurisdiction under 
the Hague Convention.  Again, this is a prime opport unity to inform the cour t of its jurisdictional 
limits and ensure that the court understands what issues it can and cannot decide under the Hague 
Convention. 
After the abducting parent has been served, an evidentiary trial is held.  The trial typically 
consists of an opening argument, examination and cross-examinati on of witnesses, and a closing 
argument.  The court may, sua sponte , decide to interview the child.  Jurisdictions differ in their 
approach to considering a child’s  testimony in a Hague Convention case.  If a court decides to 
speak with the child, typically the child will be taken into chambers where the court will question 
him or her.  Some courts allow counsel to be present, but not the parents.  The purpose of the 
court’s questioning is to determine the child’s preference regarding resi dence and/or to obtain NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 8 
 additional testimony regarding defenses that may have been raised in the proceeding.  This 
situation should arise only when the court deems the child sufficiently ma ture to understand the 
issues and express objecti ons to being returned. 
After this evidentiary hearing, the court will issue a decisi on on whether the child should 
be returned to the home country.  If the court grants the return, the opposing party may appeal to 
the appropriate appellate court.  In light of the potential for app eal and/or a motion to stay the 
return order, travel arrangements  should be orchestrated so that the left-behind parent and child 
can leave the country as soon as the court enters a return order, thereby mooting any subsequent 
filings that may delay enforcement of a return order.16  If the appellate court issues a stay, the 
left-behind parent and child may have to stay in  the United States for an additional period of 
time.17 
In Hague Convention cases, practitioners ofte n struggle with the pr actical logistics of 
returning a child.  Various options  for the payment of travel expenses and potential available 
airline and hotel discounts shoul d be explored.  Where the child  will reside pe nding the final 
hearing also requires strategic anal ysis and advocacy, as the lawyers will need to assist the court 
in deciding where the child will be  most secure pending the trial.  This process provides counsel 
with an opportunity to work with  judges’ chambers, translators, social services, federal marshals, 
and other law enforcement personnel in a problem-sol ving mode to achieve the client’s goals.  It 
                                                 
16 See Bekier v. Bekier , 248 F.3d 1051, 1056 (11th Cir. 2001) (holding that removal of the children from 
the jurisdiction of the court mooted the appeal).  But see Fawcett v. McRoberts , 326 F.3d 491, 494-97 (4th 
Cir. 2003) (holding that an appeal was not moot desp ite removal of the children from court’s jurisdiction). 
17 Both the transportation costs associated with the ch ild’s return and attorney’s fees can be sought and 
recovered by the left-behind parent.  See 42 U.S.C. § 11607(b) . This relief should be requested in the 
initial petition.  Realistically, however, these costs usually  are borne by the left-behind parent and/or their 
counsel’s firm. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 9 
 is best to identify these issues as early as possi ble in the proceeding so th ey can be incorporated 
into the trial plan and counsel can be prepared for all related contingencies. 
Ultimately, when filing a petition for retur n, counsel must anticipate the respondent’s 
response.  Explosive allegations often are raised in response to  the petition for return.  For 
example, defensive allegations may include spousal abuse, neglect or child cruelty.  These issues 
should be discussed in your firs t substantive client interview. 
In addition to preparing the left-behind parent for these potential defenses, the first 
discussion with your client should cover all relevant topics that can be used to build the case, 
including the exercise of custody, an y agreements between the parties,  and other logistical issues.  
By first identifying the jurisdiction and then read ing through this Manual, counsel will have an 
understanding of the issues a court will cons ider in deciding a Hague Convention case. 
II. ESTABLISHING A PRIMA FACIE  CASE FOR RETURN 
The Hague Convention provides that if the petitioner successfully proves a prima facie  
case, the child must be return ed unless the respondent can prove that an affirmative defense 
applies.  See Section III .  The petitioner must demonstrate a prima facie  case by a preponderance 
of the evidence.18 
                                                 
18 42 U.S.C. § 11603(e) . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 10 
 The elements of a prima facie  case are enumerated in Articles 319 and 420 of the Hague 
Convention .  Courts have recognized th at the petitioner establish a prima facie  case if he or she 
proves three elements:  (1) prior to removal or  wrongful retention, the child was habitually 
resident in a foreign country; (2) the removal or retention was in breach of custody rights under 
the foreign country’s law; and (3) the petitioner ac tually was exercising custody rights at the time 
of the removal or wrongful retention.21  If the petitioner establishes a prima facie  case, the 
abducted child must be returned to the country of habitual residence unless the respondent can 
prove that one of the designate d affirmative defenses applies.22 
Although most decisions re cite these three elemen ts as establishing a prima facie  case, 
technically there is at least one more element:  proving that the abducted child is under the age of 
16.  This is a critical element of a Hague Convention case because, as further discussed below, Article 4
 of the Hague Convention explic itly states that “[t]he C onvention shall cease to apply 
when the child attains the age of 16 years.”23 
In addition, although not pa rt of the petitioner’s prima facie  case, if the petitioner can 
demonstrate that the petition is filed within one year of the wrongful removal or retention, then 
                                                 
19 Hague Convention, supra  note 2, art. 3 .  Article 3  provides: 
The removal or the retention of a child is to be cons idered wrongful where – (a) it is in breach of rights of 
custody attributed to a person, an in stitution or any other body, either jo intly or alone, under the law of the 
State in which the child was habitually resident imme diately before the removal or retention; and (b) at 
the time of removal or retention those rights were act ually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would 
have been so exercised but for the removal or reten tion. The rights of custody mentioned in subparagraph 
a above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, 
or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State. 
20 Id. at art. 4.  Article 4  provides:  “The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident 
in a Contracting State immediately before any breach  of custody or access rights.  The Convention shall 
cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years.”

 the well-settled affirmative defense in Article 12  of the Hague Conventio n does not apply.  Thus, 
while technically not part of the petitioner’s prima facie  case, proving that the petition was filed 
within one year of wrongful removal or retenti on is critically important and is discussed below as 
if it were an element of th e petitioner’s burden of proof. 
A. HABITUAL RESIDENCE PRIOR TO WRONGFUL REMOVAL OR RETENTION WAS 
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY . 
To establish a prima facie  case, a petitioner first must demonstrate that the child was 
habitually resident in one Hague signatory co untry and then was wrongfully removed to or 
retained in a different Hague signatory country.24  The determination of the child’s country of 
habitual residence therefore is central to  the disposition of a Hague Convention case. 
For the Hague Convention to apply, the abdu cted child must have  been “habitually 
resident in a Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access rights.”25  To 
be actionable under the Hague Convention, child  abduction and retention cases must be 
international, and the involved countries must be  recognized by the United States as signatories 
to the Convention.26  For example, the Hague Conventi on would not apply in a case where a 
child is habitually resident in Atlanta, Georgi a and is wrongfully removed to Phoenix, Arizona, 
since the child remained in the same country.  Similarly, the Hague C onvention would not apply 
in a case where the child is removed from the United States to Japan because Japan is not a 
signatory to the Hague Convention.   However, if the child is living in and removed from the 
United States to Mexico City, the Hague C onvention would apply because the child was

 removed from the country where he or she was a habitual resident and both Mexico and the 
United States are signatories to the Convention.27 
The determination of habitual residence also  is important because the parents’ custody 
rights are governed by the laws of the country of habitual residence.28  Despite the significance 
of determining habitual residence, it is de fined neither by the Ha gue Convention nor by 
ICARA.29  Notably, the Hague Permanent Bureau surveyed signatory countries in 2010 and 
inquired about the feasibility and de sirability of a protocol to th e Convention to define the term 
“habitual residence”30  However, as of February 2012, no su ch protocol has been implemented 
and the United States opposed the addition of a de finition of “habitual residence,” explaining that 
it would be very difficult for th e member countries to come to a consensus on the meaning of the 
term.31  United States courts view the habitual re sidence issue as a mixe d question of law and 
fact that is a highly fact-specific inquiry.32

 The habitual residence is determined at th e point in time “immediately before the 
removal or retention.”33  Beyond this limited guidance, the Hague Convention offers no insight 
as to which, if any, factors are to be given we ight.  Accordingly, an extensive body of domestic 
and international law has developed.  All eleven circuits have addresse d the determination of 
habitual residence and identified a number of  factors that should be evaluated.  Among the 
factors courts may consider are changes in physi cal location, th e location of personal possessions 
and pets, the passage of time, whether the family retained its prior residence or sold it before 
relocating, whether the child has enrolled in school , the parents’ in tentions at the time of a move, 
and whether the child has establishe d relationships in the new location.34    A circuit-by-circuit 
summary of selected case law follows.  Many of the circuits apply similar, although not necessarily identical, methodologies in determining the habitual residence.  As shown below, one 
particularly notable difference is th at some circuits will consider the parents’ in tent as relevant to 
the habitual residence question, whereas other circuits will focus exclusively on the child’s 
experiences. 
District courts within the First Circuit ha ve employed very fact-s pecific analyses in 
determining the habitual residence.
35  The consensus among many of  these decisions has been 
that “a child’s habitual residence is to be dete rmined by examining the facts and circumstances at 
hand.”36  More recently, the First Circuit has begun to follow a more structured approach to

 evaluate questions about habitual  residence.  For instance, in Nicolson v. Pappalardo ,37 the First 
Circuit adopted an approach similar to that of the Second Circuit, discussed below, that focuses 
on “the parents’ shared intent or settle d purpose regarding their child’s residence.”38 
Gitter v. Gitter39 afforded the Second Circuit its first occasion to interpret the phrase 
“habitually resident” within the meaning of  the Hague Convention.  The Second Circuit 
examined both parental intent and the child’ s degree of acclimation to the residence in 
establishing the habitual residence of the child.  The court explained that an analysis of the 
habitual residence should begin by focusing on the intent of the persons entitled to fix the place 
of the child’s residence, which is most frequently the parents.40  The terms of the Convention 
make it seem logical to focus on the intent of the child, but the court found that children usually 
do not possess the “material and psychological wher ewithal to decide where they will reside.”41  
Parental intent is determined by actions as well as declarations.42  For the second part of the 
inquiry, the court held that one mu st look into whether the child has become acclimated to his or 
her new surroundings such that thei r habitual reside nce has shifted.43 
In Poliero v. Centenaro ,44 the Second Circuit again followed this two part an alysis.  With 
respect to the first prong , the court found that th ere was no “‘settled inte ntion to abandon’ Italy 
as the children’s habitual residenc e” in favor of New York.  The court noted that the parties had

 not attempted to sell the family home in Ital y, had maintained their personal belongings and 
furniture in Italy, merely leased and rented pr operty in New York (but sent their children to 
school in New York), and had purcha sed tickets for the enti re family to return  to Italy with the 
intent to re-enroll the children in school there.45  Turning to the se cond prong, the court found 
that the children had not become acclimated to New York, noting that although the children 
appeared to have “adjusted well” to New York and “expressed some preference for remaining,” 
they also had maintained contact with friends and family in Italy.46 
Earlier, the Third Circuit examined the term “habitually resident” in Feder v. Evans-
Feder47 and concluded that: 
[A] child’s habitual residence is the place where he . . . has been 
physically present for a time su fficient for acclimatization and 
which has a “degree of settle d purpose” from the child’s 
perspective . . . .  [A] determinati on of whether any particular place 
satisfies this standard must focus on the child and consists of an analysis of the child’s circumstances in that place and the parents’ present, shared intentions regarding their child’s presence there.
48 
However, in Delvoye v. Lee ,49 the Third Circuit found this te st to be inadequate when 
applied to the unique context of a very young infa nt whose parents lacked a settled intention 
regarding their child’s residence.   Because infant child ren cannot acquire habitual residence apart 
from their caregivers, it often is difficult to make a distinction between the habitual residence of an infant child and that of his or her custodian.
50  Thus, the habitual residence of infant children 
most often is found to be the pare ntal residence.  However, the Delvoye  court found that “where

 the [parental] conflict is contemporaneous with the birth of the child, no habitual residence may 
ever come into existence” for the child.51  Accordingly, where the pare nts lack shared intentions 
about their child’s presence in a country, the infant child does not become a habitual resident.  In 
reaching its decision, the court quoted a Scottish commentator: 
A newborn child born in the coun try where his parents have their 
habitual residence could normally  be regarded as habitually 
resident in that country.  Where a child is born while his mother is 
temporarily present in a country ot her than that of her habitual 
residence it does seem, however, that the child will normally have no habitual residence until living in  a country on a footing of some 
stability.
52 
In Miller v. Miller ,53 the Fourth Circuit opined that th ere is no real distinction between 
ordinary residence and habitual residence, and that a person can have only one habitual 
residence, which correlates to the child’s residence prior to removal.54  The court repeated that to 
properly engage in the inquiry, “[t]he c ourt must look back in time, not forward.”55  Specifically, 
it found that parents cannot create a new ha bitual residence by wrongfully removing and 
sequestering a child.56  To do so would violate the purpo se of the Hague Convention.  In 
Maxwell v. Maxwell ,57 the Fourth Circuit applied a two-part analysis similar to that of Gitter v. 
Gitter , examining both the intent of the parents a nd whether the children had become acclimated 
to their new residence.58  In doing so, the court cited several factors relevant to the two prongs of

 the test and provided a potentially useful list of fact-specific cases  that may be helpful depending 
on the facts of the case at hand.59 
In Isaac v. Rice ,60 a district court in the Fifth Circu it used the children’s past experiences 
to determine habitual residence, but also rec ognized the necessity to consider “the shared 
intentions of the parents regarding th e child’s presence in that country.” 
The Sixth Circuit focused on the child’s accl imation and past experiences in a specific 
location to establish habitual residence in Friedrich v. Friedrich .61  In Friedrich , the child lived 
with his parents in Germany until the father for ced the child and mother out of the apartment, 
whereupon the mother removed the child to the United States.62  The mother argued that the 
child’s habitual residence was the United States b ecause she always intended to move there, but 
the court held that “to determine the habitual re sidence, the court must focus on the child, not the 
parents, and examine past experi ences, not future intentions.”63  As a result, the court held that 
the child’s habitual residence was Germany.  In Robert v. Tesson ,64 the Sixth Circuit reiterated 
that the habitual residence analysis must focus on a child’s past experiences, not the future 
intentions of the parents, recognizing that su ch an analysis diverged somewhat from other 
circuits.65

 The Seventh Circuit in Koch v. Koch66 recognized that the purpose of habitual residence 
was “‘to identify the place where the children are settled and wher e recent information about the 
quality of family life is available.’”67  The court held that “a child will be found to be habitually 
resident in a country if he or she has been living there for a su fficient period of time.  Where 
there is geographic stability and adequate duration, questions as to the purpose of the residence 
will usually be pushed into the background.”68 
In Silverman v. Silverman ,69 the Eighth Circuit held that  habitual residence can be 
established only by focusing on both the settle d purpose from the child’ s perspective and the 
parents’ intent.  The Ninth Circuit in Mozes v. Mozes70 held that habitual residence is determined 
by the parents’ intent regarding the child’s residence and the child’s perspective of where he or 
she is acclimated.71 
The Tenth Circuit took a more fact-specific approach in Kanth v. Kanth ,72 holding that “a 
child’s habitual residence is defined by examining the specific facts and circumstances” and “the 
conduct, intentions and agreements of the pa rents during the time preceding the abduction are 
important factors to be considered.”73

 Finally, in Ruiz v. Tenorio ,74 the Eleventh Circuit interpreted “habitual residence” 
according to the “ordinary and natural meaning of the two words it contains, as a question of fact 
to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of a particular case.”75  To establish a new 
habitual residence, there must be a “settle d intention to abandon the one left behind.”76  T h e  
“settled intention” does not have to be clear at the time of depa rture and can develop over time.  
The court explained that there must be an “act ual change in geography and the passage of a 
sufficient length of time for the child to have become acclimatized.”77  However, in cases where 
the parents lacked a shared intent, the court cau tioned against placing too much emphasis on the 
child’s contacts in the new country to determ ine whether the child had become acclimated.78  
The court explained that “divining the significan ce of such contacts is extremely difficult,” and 
that “children can be remarkably adaptable even in short periods without any significance with 
respect to habitual residence.”79 
B. REMOVAL OR RETENTION WAS WRONGFUL BECAUSE CUSTODY RIGHTS WERE 
BREACHED . 
A valid petition must allege th at removal or retention of th e child was wrongful.  As is 
true for all other elements of a  prima facie  case, the petitioner must  prove this element by a 
preponderance of the evidence.80

the child to Wales). 
80 42 U.S.C. § 11603(e) . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 20 
 Article 3  of the Hague Convention provides that removal or retentio n of the child is 
wrongful where it is in breach of  custody rights attributed to a pe rson, an institution, or another 
entity, either jointly or alone, under the law of the country in which the child was habitually 
resident immediately before  the removal or retention.81  The Hague Convention provides little 
guidance toward the determination of whether the petitioner has custody rights.  However, 
Article 5(a)  broadly states that “rights of custody” are “rights relati ng to the care of the person of 
the child and, in particul ar, the right to determine the child’ s place of residen ce.”  Custody rights 
differ from “rights of access,” wh ich the Hague Convention defines as  “the right to take a child 
for a limited period of time to a place othe r than the child’s habitual residence.”82  The Hague 
Convention allows petitioners to seek the return of children if they have “custody rights” of the 
children as compared to “rights of access.”  See Section VI  below for a detailed discussion on the 
issue of rights of access. 
Custody rights may arise (a) by operation of  law, or (b) by reas on of a judicial or 
administrative decision or an agreement having legal effect under the law of the country of 
habitual residence.83  Most cases discussing whether pe titioners have cu stody rights involve 
custody rights that arise by operation of law.  In cases where the parties have an agreement or a 
judicial decree, courts usually hold that the issue of custody ri ghts is undisputed.  The following 
section highlights recurring issues  regarding rights of custody th at arise by operation of law.

 1. Breach Of Rights Arising By Operation Of Law. 
In operation of law cases, courts usually a ssess the rights granted to the petitioner under 
the applicable civil code.84  The Hague Convention expressly allo ws United States courts to take 
notice of the laws of foreign courts regarding custody determinations.85 
The case of Sealed Appellant v. Sealed Appellee86 discusses custody rights arising by 
operation of law.  Under Australian law, in the abse nce of any orders of the court, each parent is 
a joint guardian and has cu stody rights over the child.87  In Sealed Appellant , the father had not 
been stripped of his custody rights.88  Therefore, the only issue for the court was whether the 
father had exercised his custody rights.89  How to determine whether the left-behind parent was 
exercising custody rights at the time of the abduction is di scussed further in Section II.C  of this 
Manual. 
A petitioner seeking to establish custody rights by  operation of law may be  able to rely on 
patria potestas90 when the child’s country of habitual  residence recognizes such rights.  Patria 
potestas , a concept of parental aut hority found in many civil law countries, is generally “the 
relationship of rights and obliga tions that are held reciproca lly, on the one hand, by the father 
and the mother (or in some cases the grandpar ents) and, on the other hand, the minor children 
who are not emancipated.”91  Countries whose laws are based on civil codes are most likely to

 recognize patria potestas  rights and often define these rights in the context of the parents’ state 
of wedlock and exercise of physical custody.92  United States courts generally have accepted 
custodial rights arising under patria potestas  as sufficient to establish a left-behind parent’s right 
to seek the return of the child.  If parents have entered into a divorce decree that contains terms 
regarding the custody of the child, courts may seek to defi ne the scope of custodial rights 
asserted under patria potestas  in light of the decree.93 
In Whallon v. Lynn ,94 the child’s parents resided in Mexico and had never married.  
Mexico’s Civil Code defines the doctrine of patria potestas  and provides that where children are 
born out of wedlock, both parent s exercise parental authorit y.  It also distinguishes patria 
potestas  from physical custody.  The First Circuit examined Mexico’s concept of patria potestas  
and held that these rights were more than mere visitation rights or rights of access because patria 
potestas  rights imply a meaningful decision-maki ng role in the life and care of a child.95  The 
court found that the left-behind fa ther/petitioner in Mexico had ri ghts of custody and, therefore, 
that the removal of the child withou t the father’s consent was wrongful.96

child because the decree awarded custody of the child  to the mother and only rights of visitation to the 
father); Gonzalez v. Gutierrez , 311 F.3d 942, 949 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that patria potestas rights do

 Similarly, in Giampaolo v. Erneta ,97 the Eleventh Circuit found that the father/petitioner 
of an out-of-wedlock child had rights of custody because under Argentine law, if the parents had 
cohabitated, both had patria potestas  rights.  Argentine law “denot es the set of rights and duties 
belonging to the parents in respect to the pe rson and property of their children, for their 
protection and integral education,  from the moment of their c onception and while under age and 
not emancipated.”98  An agreement granting the mother physical custody of the child did not 
vitiate the patria potestas  rights of the father/petitioner; t hus, the removal of the child from 
Argentina was wrongful.99 
2. Breach Of Rights Arising By Judi cial Or Administrative Decrees Or 
Agreement Of The Parties. 
In addition to custody rights arising by operation of law, cust ody rights can be 
determined by judicial or administrative decree or  by agreement of the parties.  In determining 
the custodial rights of parents w ho have entered into a joint sti pulated custody agreement, courts 
often make binding assessments rega rding parents’ custodial rights to their children.  As with 
custodial rights arising under operation of law or patria potestas , the terms of a custody order are 
binding on parents and will serve as evidence of custodial rights in a Hague Convention case.100 
Frequently, judicial decrees  and custody orders contain ne exeat  clauses, which are 
defined as writs mandating that the person to whom they are addressed not leave the country, the state, or the jurisdiction of the court.
101  The circuits originally  were split over whether ne exeat  
clauses constituted custodial rights entitled to  enforcement under the Hague Convention.  The

 Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits had held that ne exeat clauses were not custodial rights under 
the Hague Convention, reasoning that a ne exeat clause “confers only a veto, a power in reserve, 
which gives the non-custodial pare nt no say (except by leverage) about any child-rearing issue 
other than the child’s geographical location in the broadest sense.”102  On the other hand, the 
Eleventh Circuit had held that ne exeat rights were custody rights wi thin the meaning of the 
Hague Convention, reasoning that a ne exeat right gives the noncustodial parent a joint right to 
determine the child’s place of residence.103 
The Supreme Court resolved this circuit split in Abbott v. Abbott ,104 ruling that a ne exeat 
right is  a right of custody under the Hague Convention.105  In Abbott , a Chilean court had granted 
the mother “daily care and cont rol of the child, while awarding the father ‘direct and regular’ 
visitation rights. . . .”106  Chilean law also conferred on the father a ne exeat right.107   In holding 
that the father’s ne exeat  right amounted to a right of cu stody under the Hague Convention, the 
Court noted that the Convention de fines “rights of custody” to incl ude “rights relatin g to the care 
of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child’s place of 
residence.”108  Similar to the Eleventh Circuit’s analysis, the Supreme Court equated the ne exeat 
right to a joint right to determine the child’s country of residence.109  Justices Stevens, Thomas,

 and Breyer dissented from the ma jority, contending that the fath er’s rights amounted to only 
visitation rights.110 
C. PETITIONERS MUST BE EXERCISING THEIR CUSTODY RIGHTS AT THE TIME OF 
REMOVAL . 
In addition to possessing custody rights under the laws of the country where the child 
habitually resides, the petitioner also must exercise those rights.111  The determination of whether 
a left-behind parent has exercise d custody rights is another highly  fact-specific analysis in a 
Hague Convention case.  In Friedrich v. Friedrich (Friedrich II) ,112 the Sixth Ci rcuit provided 
guidelines for determining whether a petitioner properly exercised cust ody rights.  The Sixth 
Circuit held that courts should “liberally find ‘exercise’ [of cu stody rights] whenever a parent 
with de jure  custody rights keeps, or seeks to keep, a ny sort of regular cont act with his or her 
child,”113 and that “as a general rule, any attempt to maintain a somewhat regular relationship 
with the child should constitute ‘exercise.’”114  The Sixth Circuit stated that: 
[I]f a person has valid custody rights to a child under the law of the 
country of the child’s habitual resi dence, that person cannot fail to 
“exercise” those custody rights und er the Hague Convention short 
of acts that constitute clear and unequivocal abandonment of the 
child.  Once [the court] determ ines that the parent exercised 
custody rights in any manner, it should stop—comp letely avoiding

111 Courts have required that the petitioner demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she 
actually was exercising custody rights at the time of removal, Krefter v. Wills , 623 F. Supp. 2d 125, 135 
(D. Mass. 2009), or immediately prior to the removal or retention, Hague Convention, art. 3 , Nicolson v.

custody rights at the time of the removal) and Morrison-Dietz v. Dietz , No. 07-1398, 2008 WL 4280030,

omitted), aff’d , 349 F. App’x 930 (5th Cir. 2009).

 the question whether the parent ex ercised the custody rights well or 
badly.  These matters go to the merits of the custody dispute and are, therefore, beyond the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal 
courts.
115 
The Friedrich II  court held that the father/petitioner exercised his de jure  custody rights because 
in the short separation before the mother/res pondent removed the child from Germany, the 
father/petitioner visited with the child a nd made arrangements for further visitation.116 
Other courts have followed the reasoning of Friedrich II .  In Giampaolo , the Eleventh 
Circuit found that the father/pet itioner exercised his rights of custody because he picked up the 
child every morning to take her to school, chose the child’s school, paid fo r some of the child’s 
private school tuition, and saw the child the day before the mo ther/respondent left Argentina. 
The First and Fifth Circuits also  have followed the reasoning of Friedrich II .  In the case 
of Aldinger v. Segler ,117 the court held that the father/pet itioner exercised his custody rights 
because he lived at the same address as the child ren and actively participated in the lives of the 
children by providing for their basic n eeds.  Similarly, in the case of Sealed Appellant v. Sealed 
Appellee ,118 the court held that the fa ther/petitioner exercised his custody rights because he had 
visited the children about five times per year and paid child support to the mother/respondent. 
D. THE CHILDREN MUST BE UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN . 
The Hague Convention states explicitly that it  “shall cease to apply when the child attains 
the age of 16 years.”119  The drafters of the Hague Conven tion easily could have  stated—as they 
did for the well-settled defense in Article 13 —that the Convention would not apply unless “the

 commencement of proceedings” occurred before the children is sixteen.  However, they did not 
and instead stated flatly that the Convention “sha ll cease to apply” once the child is sixteen.  The 
State Department’s official commentary and le gal analysis of the Convention explains that: 
“[t]he Convention applies only to children under the ag e of sixteen (16).  Even  if a child is under 
sixteen at the time of the wrongful removal or retention as well as wh en the Convention is 
invoked, the Convention ceases to apply when the child reaches sixteen.”120  L e g a l  
commentators agree that this was the inte nt of the drafters of the Convention.121 
Thus, once a child reaches the age of sixteen, the child cannot be returned under the 
Hague Convention, even if the child was less th an sixteen years old at the time of wrongful 
removal and even if the petition was filed when the child was less than sixteen years old.122  
Accordingly, when seeking relie f under the Hague Convention, it is  imperative to account not 
only for the child’s age at the time of filing the petition, but also for th e probable length of the 
                                                 
120 See Public Notice 957, supra  note 6, at 10504 (citation omitted). 
121 See Perez-Vera Report, supra  note 7, ¶ 77  (noting the Convention adopted the “most restrictive” of the 
various options regarding age limit ations, and thus “no action or d ecision based upon the Convention’s 
provisions can be taken with regard to a child after its sixteenth birthday”). 
122 Note that while the Hague Convention cannot be used to order the return of a child who has reached the 
age of sixteen, other legal means can be employed.  The State Department’s official commentary states 
that: 
Articles 18 , 29, and 34 make clear that the Convention is a none xclusive remedy in cases of international 
child abduction.  Article 18  provides that the Convention does not limit the power of a judicial authority 
to order return of a child at any time, presumably under other laws, procedures or comity, irrespective of 
the child’s age.  Article 29  permits the person who claims a breach of custody or access rights, as defined 
by Articles 3  and 21, to bypass the Convention completely by i nvoking any applicable laws or procedures 
to secure the child’s return.  Likewise, Article 34  provides that the Convention shall not restrict the 
application of any law in the Stat e addressed for purposes of obtaining the child’s return or for organizing 
visitation rights.  Assuming such laws are not restrict ed to children under sixteen, a child sixteen or over 
may be returned pursuant to their provisions. 
See Public Notice 957, supra  note 6, at 10504 . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 28 
 proceedings to determine if the child will tu rn sixteen at any point during the process.123  
Counsel also should plead and offer proof during th e hearing that the child is less than sixteen 
years old. 
E. IF TRUE, PROVE THAT THE PETITION WAS FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR OF 
WRONGFUL REMOVAL . 
As noted in the introduction of Section II  of this Manual, proving that a petition was filed 
within one year of wrongful  removal technically is no t part of the petitioner’s prima facie  case.  
However, whether the petition wa s filed within one year of wr ongful removal or retention is 
critically important and must be considered when drafting a petiti on.  If the petition is filed less 
than one year from the date of the wr ongful removal of the child, the respondent cannot  use the 
“well-settled” defense set forth in Article 12  of the Hague Convention, and the child must be 
returned regardless of how acclimated the chil d has become to his or her new surroundings.124  If 
the return proceedings are commenced one year or  more after wrongful rem oval or retention, the 
court may still order the return of  the child unless the respondent demonstrates that the child is 
“well-settled” in the new environment.125 
                                                 
123 See Mohamud v. Guuleed , No. 09-C-146, 2009 WL 1229986 (E.D. Wis. May 4, 2009).  The petitioner 
in Mohamud  advised in a cover letter accompanying her Ha gue petition “that the convention suggests that 
a decision on a petition filed thereunder be reached within six weeks of the date of filing.”  Id., 2009 WL 
1229986, at *2.  The hearing on the petition was not scheduled until nine weeks later, and the court’s 
decision stated that “the cover letter was not docketed  and the court was not made aware of the need for 
scheduling a hearing before [the child] turned sixteen.  No objection was made at the time the hearing was 
scheduled.”  Id.  The court declined to exercise jurisdiction because the Hague Convention clearly did not 
apply to children sixteen or older, but the petition w ould have been denied anyway because the petitioner, 
the child’s aunt, did not have formal legal custody of  the child, the mother’s natural rights had not been 
terminated, and the “mature” child’s wishes to stay w ith her mother would have been taken into account 
because she was fifteen when the petition was filed.  Id., 2009 WL 1229986, at *4-5. 
124 See Hague Convention, supra  note 2, art. 12 . 
125 Id.  See Falk v. Sinclair , 692 F. Supp. 2d 147, 164 (D. Me. 2010) (citing Duarte v. Bardales , 526 F.3d 
563, 569 (9th Cir. 2008) (“This one-year filing peri od is of particular impor tance under the Convention 
because the ‘well[-]settled’ affirmative defense is only available if the petition for return was filed more 
than a year from wrongful removal”)). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 29 
 Thus, as a practical matter, the court almost always will determine both (1) when the 
removal became wrongful, and (2) the date of the “commencement of the proceedings.”  These 
critical facts must be addressed in the petition if they favor the petitioner.  Otherwise, the 
petitioner’s counsel must be prepar ed to respond to a “well-settled”  defense, as explained below.  
See Section III.A . 
1. Determining When Removal Or Retention Became Wrongful. 
Courts generally agree that wrongful retention or removal begins when the parent without 
physical possession asks for the return of the child or  the ability to assert parental rights, and the 
parent with possession of the child refuses.126  When this happens, “the date of retention is that 
point when the noncustodial parent knows the cu stodial parent will not return the child.”127  
Note, however, that some courts do not require an explicit statement.  Rather, “[w]rongful 
retention occurs when the noncus todial parent is on notice that  the retaining parent does not 
intend to return with the child.  This retention may occur before there is a definitive conversation 
between the parties about the child’s return if  the noncustodial parent knew, or should have 
known, before the conversation that th e child would not be returning.”128  Furthermore, even 
where “notice of intent not to re turn a child” has been given, courts  will consider whether there is 
                                                 
126 Zuker v. Andrews , 2 F. Supp. 2d 134, 139 (D. Mass. 1998) (citing Slagenweit v. Slagenweit , 841 F.

date of retention, when Riley clearly knew Gooch would not return the child, was the date Gooch served 
Riley with a petition for dissolution of marriage).  See Blanc v. Morgan , 721 F. Supp. 2d 749, 761-62 
(W.D. Tenn. 2010) (finding the wrongful retention occurre d when the mother “made explicit her intention 
to live with [the child] in the United States,” thereb y ending “any pretense by [the] [m]other that she 
intended to return to France. . . .”). 
128 Etienne v. Zuniga , No. C10-5061BHS, 2010 WL 2262341, at *9-10 (W.D. Wash. June 2, 2010) 
(citation omitted) (finding that circumstances such as the removing parent’s statement in July 2008 that 
“she was going to give the children a better life than he could give them,” the fact that the children were 
not back in Mexico to start school in January 2009, and that the children were still enrolled in school in 
Washington in January 2009 indicated the plaintiff kne w or should have known befo re February 2009 that 
they were not returning to Mexico). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 30 
 an agreement in place between the parents as to  a trip, a visit, or temporary or permanent 
residency.129  Where there is an agreement, “wrongful retention begins when the agreed date [of 
return] passes, not when the earl ier notice of intent is given.”130 
In Slagenweit v. Slagenweit ,131 the court determined that wrongful retention occurred 
when the parent without physical  possession first asked that th e child be retu rned and the 
custodial parent refused.132  The court also noted that: 
Since the Convention is directed principally at protection of the 
child, it can certainly be argued that the one year should be 
measured from the date the child actually starts living with the parent from whom custody is sou ght since it is clear that the 
Convention is concerned about the interest of the child who has become “settled” in his or her new environment.  On the other 
hand, the Convention speaks about one year from the “wrongful removal or retention.”  As in th is case, there can be no wrongful 
retention when the child is residi ng with the parent from whom 
custody is sought pursuan t to an agreement be tween the parents.  
The wrongful retention does not  begin until the noncustodial 
parent . . . clearly communicates he r desire to regain custody and 
asserts her parental right to have [the child] live with her.
133 
As a result, the Slagenweit  court held that the one-year period did in fact begin when the 
“wrongful” element of removal or retention took place ( i.e., at the point when the parent without 
physical possession was denied her agreed-upon right to have the ch ild live with her).  The court 
reasoned: 
This reading gives effect to the literal wording of the Convention 
and comports with what this cour t believes to be the spirit of the 
Convention.  In those cases where the child has become so settled 
in her new environment by mutual agreement of the parties, prior

131 841 F. Supp. 264, 270 (N.D. Iowa 1993). 
132 Id.  Likewise, in Falls v. Downie , the court stated that retention became wrongful when the child’s 
mother asked that the child be returned and the father refused.  871 F. Supp. 100, 102 (D. Mass. 1994). 
133 841 F. Supp. at 270. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 31 
 to the assertion of custodial ri ghts, then the case should be 
analyzed under the question of whether a new habitual residency has been established for the child.
134 
The Slagenweit  court also noted that, in cases where a change in custody had been 
previously mutually agreed upon but was foll owed by a demand for return, “the parent 
demanding the return will have a difficult time showing that the voluntary change of place of residence did not also result in change of habitual residency.”
135  While the Slagenweit case was 
not determined specifically on this issue, it is instructive on when a removal takes place and 
when that removal becomes wrongful.136 
The decision of the court in Zuker v. Andrews137 offers a more thorough analysis about 
when wrongful retention occurs , holding that it occurs when  the parent without physical 
possession is on notice that the custodial parent does not intend to return with the child.138  In 
Zuker , the court had trouble determining when wrongf ul retention occurred because the mother 
who had possession of the child gave the father mixed messages, telling him in June 1996 that 
she and the child would return to Argentina from the United States for a visit, but later admitting 
that she lied to the fath er about her intentions.139  In July 1997, she told the father that she did not 
want to have anything to do with him and would not  return to Argentina or live with him in the 
United States.140  The husband claimed that the retenti on occurred at that point, because until

child only became wrongful when child was not return ed after close of school year and father realized 
that mother did not intend to return).

 then, he did not know that the mother was not going to return the child to Argentina.141  The 
court, however, held that  the retention occurred in February of 1997 when the mother moved into 
her own apartment, because at that point, th e husband knew or should have known that the 
mother would not retu rn with the child.142 
2. Determining When Proceedings Were Commenced. 
Proceedings commence upon “the filing of a civ il petition for relief in any court which 
has jurisdiction in the place where the child is  located at the time the petition is filed.”143  Thus, 
proceedings normally will commence upon the filing of the petition for return of the child.  
Merely contacting a country’s Central Authority  or law enforcement with a complaint does not 
constitute commencing an action for the purpose of defeating an Article 12  exception,144 even 
though Article 8  states that a parent whose “child has b een removed or retain ed in breach of 
custody rights may apply either to  the Central Authority of the ch ild’s habitual residence or to 
the Central Authority of any other Contracting St ate for assistance in securing the return of the 
child.”145 
3. Tolling Of The One-Year Period. 
Courts have acknowledged that th e “general rule is that a cour t shall order the return of a 
wrongfully-removed or retained child unless more than a year has elapsed between the date of 
the child’s wrongful removal or retention and the date that the proceedings were commenced and

abducting parents should not benefit from their act ions.  Courts also do not want to reward 
abducting parents for concealing children.  Thus, cour ts have held, in some circumstances, that 
the one-year deadline may be extended if the abducting parent conceals the child from the left-
behind parent.147  This concept is referred to  as equitable tolling.  If a petition for retu rn is filed 
after a year, the petitioner often provides lengthy fact-specific narr atives to explain the reasons 
for the delay, such as the abducting parent’s prom ise to return the child, difficulty in locating the 
abductor and child, or the left-beh ind parent’s lack of knowledge  or ability to file a Hague 
Convention case for return.148  In cases where a return was denied based on the well-settled 
defense, the court noted that the left-behind parent made little effort to file the petition within one year and no extenuating circumstances were present.
149 
United States courts have reached a consen sus allowing for equitable tolling of the one-
year period required under Article 12 , which conforms with the State Department’s analysis on 
the topic: 
If the alleged wrongdoer conceale d the child’s whereabouts from 
the custodian necessitating a long se arch for the child and thereby 
delayed the commencement of a return proceeding by the

 applicant, it is highly questio nable whether the respondent should 
be permitted to benefit from such conduct absent strong 
countervailing considerations.150 
For example, in Mendez Lynch v. Mendez Lynch ,151 the court held that “[ i]f equitable tolling does 
not apply to ICARA and the Hague Convention, a parent who abducts and conceals children for 
more than one year will be re warded for the misconduct by creating eligibility for an affirmative 
defense not otherwise available.”152 
The Eleventh Circuit was the first appellate court to analyze the question of equitable 
tolling under ICARA in cases where a parent wro ngfully removed a child and then concealed the 
child’s whereabouts to prevent the other parent fro m filing within one year of the removal.  The 
Eleventh Circuit addressed the issue in Lops v. Lops153 but did not reach a final conclusion.154  
The Eleventh Circuit later reexamined the issue in Furnes v. Reeves .155  I n  Furnes , the court 
clearly held that “equitable tol ling may apply to ICARA petitions for the return of a child where 
the parent removing the child has secreted the child from the parent seeking return.”156  A  
number of other district court cases within the Eleventh Circu it have extended the reasoning of

 Lops  and Furnes .157  Courts in other jurisdictions also have demonstrated their inclination to 
allow equitable tolling in concealment cases.158 
On the other hand, at least two courts have expressed reservations about treating the one-
year period in Article 12  as a statute of limita tions.  The court in Toren v. Toren159 categorically 
denied equitable tolling, albeit without using the term expressly, when it held: 
The language of the Convention is unambiguous, measuring the 
one-year period from the “date of th e wrongful . . . retention.”   It 
might have provided that the peri od should be measured from the 
date the offended-against party learned or had notice of the 
wrongful retention, but it  does not.  That is not surprising, since the 
evident import of the provision is not so much to provide a 
potential plaintiff with a reasonabl e time to assert any claims, as a 
statute of limitations does, but rather to put some limit on the 
uprooting of a settled child.160 
Meanwhile, the court in Anderson v. Acree161 delivered what ultimately might be the 
middle ground between the Toren  ruling and the progeny of Lops .  In Anderson , when

parent changed residences several times); Cabrera v. Lozano (In re Cabrera) , 323 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1313 
(S.D. Fla. 2004) (citing Furnes v. Reeves , 362 F.3d 702, 723 (11th Cir. 2004) in finding that “equitable

Fla. 2002) (allowing equitable tolling where abducting parent failed to prove lack of concealment by a

 considering the possibility of harm stemming fr om uprooting settled children, the court reasoned 
that: 
This potential of harm to the child remains regardless of whether 
the petitioner has a good reason for failing to file the petition 
sooner, such as where the respondent has concealed the child’s whereabouts.  There is nothing in the language of the Hague Convention which suggests that the f act that the child is settled in 
his or her new environment ma y not be considered if the 
petitioning parent has a good reason  for failing to file the petition 
within one year.
162 
The synthesis of these disparat e views might be best expresse d in the words of the court 
in Belay v. Getachew ,163 which concluded: 
The court agrees with Anderson to the extent that it identifies the 
intentions of the drafters to allo w courts to take into account the 
child’s circumstances (after the passage of time) when deciding 
whether to order a return.  The Cour t believes, however, that courts 
faced with the present situation, where the actions of the abductor 
in concealing the child may have abetted the child in forming roots in the new country, must have the flexibility to take into account 
those actions in determining the outcome of the case under Article 
12.164 
If the one-year deadline is read as a statut e of limitations, then equitable tolling likely 
applies.165  Further, when the taking parent has hidden  the child, courts are more likely to toll or

be flexible enough to allow courts to consider a child ’s settlement after the one-year period, regardless of

 equitably estop the taking parent’s use of the well-settled defense.166  Additionally, some courts 
are lenient in determining the actual date of wrongful re moval or retention.167 
III. THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES OF ARTICLES 12, 13, AND 20 
If the petitioner establishes a prima facie  case for the return of the abducted child, the 
court must order the return of the ch ild unless the respondent can rebut that prima facie  case or 
establish one of the five affirmative de fenses provided under the Hague Convention.168  T h e  
practical effect of the peti tioner’s establishment of a prima facie case is to shift the burden of 
proof to the respondent to establish on e of the five affirmative defenses.169 
The five affirmative defenses are set forth in Articles 12 , 13, and 20 of the Hague 
Convention.  Each defense is described briefly in the following paragraphs and is addressed in 
more detail in later sections of this Manual. 
The first affirmative defense, which is enumerated in Article 12 , is the well-settled 
defense.170  As discussed above, if the petition is file d less than one year from the date of the 
wrongful removal of the child, the respondent cannot  use the well-settled defense.171  The well-
settled defense must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.172 
Article 13  establishes three more affirmative defenses under the Hague Convention:  
(1) the consent or acquiescence defense, whic h involves the petitione r’s consent to or

February 2001, but court held date of wrongful rem oval or retention was June 2003, when father lost 
contact with child).

 acquiescence in the removal or re tention of the child; (2) the grave risk defense, which arises 
when the respondent contends that returning the child would place the child at grave risk of physical or psychological harm or otherwise place th e child in an intolerable situation; and (3) 
the mature child’s objection defense, which arises when the child objects to being returned, and the court finds that the child has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate 
to take the child’s views into account.
173  The grave risk defense must be proven by clear and 
convincing evidence.174  The consent or acquiescence defense and the mature child defense must 
be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.175 
Article 20  of the Hague Convention establishes a fi fth affirmative defense that rarely is 
used:  the public policy defense.  Like the grav e risk defense, the public policy defense must be 
proven by clear and convincing evidence.176 
In addition to these acceptable defenses, re spondent’s counsel also may raise a “best 
interests of the child” defense.  This is not  a legitimate defense under the Hague Convention.  
Although it is not an acceptable defense, c ounsel nonetheless should be prepared for it. 
The affirmative defenses specified in th e Hague Convention are construed narrowly.  
ICARA explicitly states that “[c]hildren who ar e wrongfully removed or retained within the 
meaning of the Convention are to be promptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set

 forth in the Convention applies.”177  Courts have recognized that the exceptions to the 
Convention are “narrow.”178 
Even if one of the affirmative defenses applies, the ultimate power to return the child still 
remains in the discretion of the court.  Article 18  of the Convention states that “[t]he provisions 
of this Chapter do not limit the pow er of a judicial or administrati ve authority to order the return 
of the child at any time.”179  In addition, the State Department  has concluded that “[t]he courts 
retain the discretion to order the child returned ev en if they consider that one or more of the 
exceptions applies.”180  Thus, even if the respondents prove an  affirmative defense, the trial court 
may exercise its discretion and or der a return “if such order would further the aims of the Hague 
Convention.”181 
A. THE ARTICLE 12 WELL-SETTLED DEFENSE :  THE CHILD HAS BECOME WELL-
SETTLED IN THE NEW SURROUNDINGS . 
The well-settled defense is an affirmativ e defense to the demand for return of a 
wrongfully-removed child and is enumerated in Article 12  of the Hague Convention.  The well-
settled defense provides that if proceedings ar e commenced more than one year after wrongful 
removal, the child should not be returned if he or  she has become settled in and is accustomed to

 his or her new surroundings.182  The well-settled defense is in applicable if proceedings were 
commenced within one year  of the wrongful removal.183  Respondents opposi ng a child’s return 
have the burden of establishing the well -settled defense through a preponderance of the 
evidence.184  As discussed below, even if some fact ors militate in favor of the well-settled 
defense, other factors may weigh against it, and ultimately, the court has discretion to order the 
return of the child notw ithstanding any defense. 
Neither ICARA nor the Hague Convention prov ides much guidance on the factors that 
should be used to determine whether a child is “settled in [the] new e nvironment.”  The State 
Department’s Public Notice 957 states that “nothi ng less than substantial evidence of the child’s 
significant connections to the new country is inte nded to suffice to meet the respondent’s burden 
of proof” for an Article 12  defense.185  Thus, courts will look be yond the passage of time and 
determine the degree to which the child is “in fact settled in or connected to the new environment so that, at least inferentiall y, return would be disruptive with likely harmful effects.”
186 
The court in Koc v. Koc (In re Koc)187 compiled a list of six fact ors to use in determining 
whether a child is settled in a new environment: 
1) the age of the child; 
2) the stability of the child’s residence in the new 
 environment; 
3) whether the child attends sc hool or day care  consistently;

 4) whether the child atte nds church regularly; 
5) the stability of the abduc ting parent’s employment; and 
6) whether the child has friends and relatives in the new 
 area.188 
The Koc court also distinguished that a “comfor table material existence” does not mean 
that a child is well-settled.189  The court went on to examine the mix of factors, including the 
child’s attendance at three school s and living in thre e different homes in three years, the 
uncertain immigration status of the child and her mother and the unstable nature of the mother’s 
employment history, before ultimately determining that the child was not settled.190  Other courts 
have adopted the Koc factors when analyzing whether the child is well-settled.  Generally, when 
these courts find the presence of most of the Koc factors, they will find the child to be settled.191  
For example, in In re Robinson , the court found that children were well-settled where the 
children had lived in the same area for 22 mont hs prior to commencemen t of the action, had 
active involvement with extended family in th e area, were doing well in school, had made

that child was well-settled were child had spent over three years in Saint Paul continuously, child had

child had numerous relatives in area and no apparent ties to France beyond father); Silvestri v. Oliva , 403

 friends, and were active participants in extracurricular activities.192  Similarly, in Wojcik v. 
Wojcik ,193 the court held that children were well-settled  where they had been in the United States 
for eighteen months and in their current residen ce for ten months, attended school or day care 
regularly, had friends and relatives in the new ar ea, attended church regularly, the mother had 
stable employment, and the petitioning father was unable to show that the children had ties to 
their home country.194 
In addition to the Koc factors, courts also consider other factors in determining whether 
children are well-sett led.  For example, courts have found that children are we ll-settled where the 
children speak English well195 or their English language skills are improving.196  Courts also may 
consider the health of the children.197 
Courts are unlikely to find that  the children are well-settled within the meaning of the 
Hague Convention in cases where the children are deemed too young to establish connections to

 where the children have lived in multiple locations in a short span of time.202Also, regardless of 
whether concealment of the children leads to e quitable tolling of the one-year period, there is 
some indication that a court may consider the stresses and instabilities inherent in such 
concealment in determining whether the children are well-settled.203  In  Antunez-Fernandes v. 
Connors-Fernandes ,204 for example, the court exercised its discretion to return the children to 
their former habitual residence even after finding that the children were well-settled in order to 
prevent the abducting parent from benefiting from erecting multiple barriers to prevent the left-behind parent from recovering or fu rther interacting with the children.
205 
Evidence that children have become well-settled also may be relevant to whether 
returning the children to their former residenc e could create a grave risk  of psychological harm 
under Article 13(b ).  The Second Circuit ha s addressed this issue206 and provided that, while the 
issue of settlement could be considered in determining whether a grave risk existed under 13(b) , 
it could never be the sole elemen t in making that determination.207  Other courts have expressed

B. THE ARTICLE 13 CONSENT OR ACQUIESCENCE DEFENSE : PETITIONERS 
CONSENTED TO OR ACQUIESCED IN THE REMOVAL OR RETENTION . 
Under Article 13(a) of the Hague Convention, the court is not bound to return a child if 
the respondent establishes that the petitioner consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the 
removal or retention.  Both defenses turn on the petitioner’s subjective intent, but they are 
distinctly different.  The defense of c onsent relates to th e petitioner’s conduct before  the child’s 
removal or retention, whereas th e defense of acquiescence relate s to “whether the petitioner 
subsequently  agreed to or accepted the removal or retention.”209  The respondent must prove 
these defenses by a preponderance of the evidence;210  however, even if one of these defenses is 
proven successfully, the court nonetheless retains discretion to  order the child’s return.211 
Courts have expressed that such consent can be proved successfu lly with relatively 
informal statements or conduct.212  Because consent requires litt le formality, courts will look 
beyond the words of the consent to  the nature and scope of the consent, keeping in mind any 
conditions or limitations imposed by the petitioner.213  Conversely, the Friedrich v. Friedrich

the surroundings to which they were abducted.’”) (quoting Friedrich v. Friedrich (Friedrich II) , 78 F.3d 
1060, 1068 (6th Cir. 1996)); McManus v. McManus , 354 F. Supp. 2d 62, 69 (D. Mass. 2005) (“A grave

 (Friedrich II)214 court held that acquiescence requires “a n act or statement with the requisite 
formality, such as testimony in a judicial procee ding; a convincing written renunciation of rights; 
or a consistent attitude of acquies cence over a significant period of time.”215  The following are 
some of the most common arguments and actions th at parents use in their attempts to prove or 
disprove the defenses of  consent and acquiescence. 
1. Authorization To Travel. 
Often, a respondent produces a signed “Author ization to Travel” document as evidence 
that the petitioner gave consent for the child to change residences.216  Courts rarely accept this as 
evidence that the other parent consented to the child’s removal.  In Mendez Lynch v. Mendez 
Lynch ,217 the court held that an Authorization to Tr avel, which allowed the children to travel 
freely, did not indicate that the ot her parent gave up his legal rights of custody.  There, a father 
signed a broad Authorization to Travel that al lowed the mother of the children to take the 
children out of Argentina.218  The court held that the “evide nce [was] clear that the written 
                                                 
21478 F.3d 1060 (6th Cir. 1996). 
215 Id. at 1070. 
216 See, e.g., Giampaolo v. Erneta , 390 F. Supp. 2d 1269, 1283 (N.D . Ga. 2004) (citing Argentine Civil 
Code, art. 264 where an Authorization to Travel  agreement required both Respondent and Petitioner’s 
consent for child to leave Argentina).  Authorizatio n to Travel agreements are typically executed under 
the guise of allowing the child to trav el abroad either for a family emergency or vacation.  They typically 
state that the child can travel to another country and then return home .  As such, they normally will not 
show that the petitioner consented to a change of the child’s residence. 
217 220 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1358-59 (M.D. Fla. 2002). 
218 Id. at 1358. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 47 
 consents to travel were given to facilitate fa mily vacation-related travel, not as consent to 
unilaterally remove the childre n from Argentina at the so le discretion of Respondent.”219 
2. Words And Actions Of Left-Behind Parents. 
Courts frequently echo the warning of the Friedrich II  court that “[e]ac h of the words and 
actions of a parent during the separation are not to  be scrutinized for a possible waiver of custody 
rights.”220  Here, a third party claimed that Mr. Friedr ich stated that he wa s not seeking custody 
of his child because he lacked the means to support the child.221  The Sixth Circuit responded 
that, even if the statement was made, it is “ins ufficient evidence of subsequent acquiescence.”222  
Additionally, “isolated statements to third part ies are not sufficient to establish consent or 
acquiescence.”223 
3. Nature Of Children’s Removal. 
When the abducting parent removes the child in  a secretive fashion – for example, during 
the night, while the other parent is aw ay, or without informing the other parent224 – a court is 
more likely to find that the other parent did not consent or acquiesce  to the child’s removal.  In 
                                                 
219 Id.; see also Moreno v. Martin , No. 08-22432-CIV, 2008 WL 4716958, at *11 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 23, 2008) 
(finding that the “Permission to Travel” signed by the fa ther supported his claim that he did not consent to 
his daughter’s removal to the United States because the document says nothing about the child permanently moving or relocating); Asvesta v. Petroutsas
, 580 F.3d 1000, 1019 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding 
that the father’s consent for the mother to travel  with the child “directly contradict[ed]” a finding that the 
father consented to the child’s indefinite stay in Greece).

mail that might have suggested that the father consente d to his child’s removal, and instead considered the 
statement in the context of the entire e-mail, which suggested that he did not consent to his child’s 
removal). 
223 Moreno , 2008 WL 4716958, at *15. 
224 See, e.g., Simcox v. Simcox , 511 F.3d 594, 603 (6th Cir. 2007) (noting that the mother “left with the 
children at midnight after her husband had fallen asleep . . . [and had] ta ken his passport and identification 
papers to prevent his pursuit of the fleeing family, and . . . once he realized they  were gone, he  engaged in 
a ‘desperate search’ for the children”). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 48 
 Friedrich II , the Sixth Circuit stated that “[t]he delib erately secretive nature of [the mother’s] 
actions is extremely strong evidence that [the fa ther] would not have cons ented to the removal of 
[the child].”225  One court referenced the abducting parent’s “deception,” which prevented any 
acquiescence by the left-behind parent.226 
4. Filing Of Hague Convention Petition. 
Several courts have identified the left-beh ind parent’s filing of a Hague Convention 
petition in and of itself as evidence that the pa rent did not consent or acquiesce to the child’s 
removal and retention.  In Moreno v. Martin ,227 the Southern District of Florida specified that the 
father’s filing of a request for his daughter’s return was an “act inconsistent with consent.”228  
Similarly, in Tabacchi v. Harrison ,229 the court identified the father’s pursuit of a Hague 
Convention petition as the “most important[]” evid ence that he had “been fighting to get his 
daughter back since the day she was taken from Italy,” and did not cons ent or acquiesce to her 
removal.230 
5. Other Considerations. 
Courts have evaluated a multitude of other considerations and arguments in determining 
whether a parent consented or ac quiesced to the child’s removal.  One court found that a father’s 
assent to an order (issued in the U.S. after the child’s arrival) that granted temporary parental

Oct. 23, 2008) (“Rather, the secretive nature of [t he abducting parent’s] departure with [the child] 
suggests that [the left-behind parent] did not consent.”) 
226 Baran v. Beaty , 479 F. Supp. 2d 1257, 1269 (S.D. Ala. 2007), aff’d , 526 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2008). 
227No. 08-22432-CIV, 2008 WL 4716958 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 23, 2008). 
228 Id., 2008 WL 4716958, at *13. 
229 No. 99 C 4130, 2000 WL 190576 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 2000). 
230 Id. at *11; see also Bocquet v. Ouzid , 225 F. Supp. 2d 1337, 1350 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (“Ms. Bocquet’s 
application for Noe’s return under the Hague Conventi on is further evidence that she did not consent to 
his removal.”). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 49 
 rights and responsibilities to the mother did no t amount to acquiescence because it was not a 
clear and unequivocal renunciation of parental rights by the father.231  Another court held that, 
where the respondent had removed and concealed the child from the petitioner for an extended period of time, the petitioner’s failure to exercise his parental rights over the child did not 
indicate that he acquiesced to the child’s remova l and retention, because his failure to do so was 
involuntary.
232 
As illustrated above, successfully establishing eith er defense is a difficult feat.  However, 
in Gonzalez-Caballero v. Mena ,233 the respondent successfully proved that the petitioner 
consented to the child’s removal from Panama to  the United States.  Th ere, the court reasoned 
that the petitioner did not object to the child becoming a United St ates citizen and had told the 
respondent that she could no longer care for the child.234  No witnesses testified that they 
understood the child’s visit to th e United States to be temporar y, and the petiti oner provided the 
respondent with all of the child ’s paperwork and helped obtain exit papers for the child.235 
C. THE ARTICLE 13 GRAVE RISK DEFENSE :  THERE IS A GRAVE RISK THAT THE 
CHILD WOULD BE EXPOSED TO PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM OR AN 
INTOLERABLE SITUATION IF RETURNED . 
Under Article 13 , a respondent may raise the defense th at the child should not be returned 
due to the grave risk of eith er “physical or psychological harm” or the existence of an

 “intolerable situation.”236  Either prong of this defense must be established by clear and 
convincing evidence.237  As with other exceptions, courts cons ider the grave risk defense to be a 
narrowly drawn exception.238  Indeed, at least one court has ca utioned that “[t]he exception for 
grave harm to the child is not license for a cour t in the abducted-to country to speculate on where 
the child would be happiest.”239 
1. Grave Risk Of Physical Or Psychological Harm. 
As a preliminary matter, courts often struggl e with the distincti on between a “risk of 
harm” and a “ grave  risk of harm.”  This requires a subj ective judgment by the fact finder.  The 
Seventh Circuit opined that “[t]he gr avity of a risk involves not only the probability  of harm, but 
also the magnitude  of the harm if the probability materializes.”240  Thus, a court may not only 
consider the probability of the threat of harm, but  also the nature of the possible harm to the 
child. 
Concepts of “magnitude” and “probability” of  harm are relative and abstract, but courts 
have provided more concrete definitions.  In Friedrich v. Friedrich (Friedrich II) ,241 the court 
characterized grave risk as placing the child in  imminent danger before the custody dispute was 
resolved in the country of habitual residence or  at grave risk for serious abuse, neglect or 
“extraordinary emotional dependence” where the c ountry of habitual resi dence could provide the

 child with adequate protection.242  In Gaudin v. Remis ,243 the Ninth Circuit stated that an analysis 
of the grave risk defense “should be concerned onl y with the degree of harm that could occur in 
the immediate future.”244  However, in Walsh v. Walsh ,245 the First Circuit rejected the 
requirement that danger be imminent  in order to establish the defense.246 
The “physical or psychological harm” exceptio n requires that the alleged harm be “a 
great deal more than minimal.”247  Courts will deny return of a child only when the child’s 
danger is “grave” or “severe” and not just “serious .”  “The harm must be greater than what is 
normally expected when taking a child away from one parent and passing the child to another 
parent,” and normal adjustment  problems are not sufficient.248  “[E]ven incontr overtible proof of 
a risk of harm will not satisfy” this defense if the “risk of harm proven lacks gravity.”249  I n  
addition, the removing parent cannot complain that  a child has grown used  to the surroundings to 
which he or she was abducted a nd use those circumstances to de ny return:  “Under the logic of 
the Convention, it is the abduction  that causes the pangs of subsequent return.”250

Blondin v. Dubois , 238 F.3d 153 (2d Cir. 2001)).  The court conc luded that the abducting parent did not

 The prospect of sexual abuse generally will qualify as a “grave risk” of physical or 
psychological harm.251  It also will qualify as an “intolerable situation.”252  With respect to other 
types of abuse, the result will depend on the facts of the case. 
In Reyes Olguin v. Cruz Santana ,253 the court held that there wa s a great risk of “severe” 
psychological harm upon the child’s return to Mexico.254  Based on the testimony of a child 
psychologist, the court concluded that if repatriated, the child would experience “suicidal 
impulses generated by his prior trau ma” of witnessing his father be at his mother, as well as his 
own experience of abuse.255  However, in McManus v. McManus ,256 the court concluded that the 
psychological harm to the children if returned  would be “serious,” but not “grave” under Article 
13(b) , because any previous abuse to the children was sporadic.257  In In re Application of Adan , 
the court held that a totality of circumstances test may apply in determining the credibility of child abuse allegations.
258  In the end, even if the child may be exposed to psychological harm if 
repatriated, the court may nonethel ess order the child’s return if the psychological harm would 
not be grave.

 Although a clear judicial consensus has not em erged, the issue of domestic and family 
violence as it relates to the grav e risk defense has been raised re peatedly in recent years.  There 
are not yet any spec ific comprehensive statistics on how often respondents are fleeing domestic 
violence or raising allega tions of domestic violence,259 but statistics indicate that the incidence of 
successful grave risk defenses has increased globally260 and in the United States.261  Scholars and 
advocates have highlighted the difference between the stereotypical abductor envisioned by the 
drafters of the Hague Conventi on and the reality that  abductors are most commonly women who 
act as primary caretakers for the children.262  In alleging grave risk to the children, litigants are 
increasingly raising the issue of domestic abuse,263 in addition to emphasizing the decades of

Counsel on both sides of a case must be prepared to address this issue when litigating a Hague 
Convention case. 
In assessing grave risk, some courts examin e whether the country of habitual residence 
has the means to protect the child from potential abuse.265  However, in 2008, the Eleventh 
Circuit concluded that neither the Hague Conve ntion, ICARA nor the Perez-Vera Report require 
a court to review evidence of whether the habi tual residence can protect at-risk children.266  The 
court noted that such an analysis requires eviden ce of the habitual residence’s “legal and social 
service systems” which can lead to “difficult pr oblems of proof” since th e respondent left the 
habitual residence.267  Consequently, the Eleventh Circui t declined to “im pose on a responding 
parent a duty to prove that her child’s country of habitual residence is unable or unwilling to 
ameliorate the grave risk of harm which w ould otherwise accompany the child’s return.”268

 2. Intolerable Situations. 
In addition to providing a defense wh ere grave risk of harm is shown, Article 13  provides 
a defense where it is shown that return would place the child in an “intolerab le situation.”  Courts 
give greater scrutiny to cases where an “intoler able situation” may exist.  An “intolerable 
situation” requires “more than a cursory evaluation of [the ho me country’s] civil stability.”269  
The court should conduct a robust evaluation of the people and ci rcumstances awaiting the child 
in the country of habitual residence.270  For instance, an “intolerable situation” does not 
“encompass return to a home where money is in short supply, or where educational or other 
opportunities are more limited than in the requested State.”271  Using this approach, the Middle 
District of Florida reasoned that, even though there was gr eat economic and governmental 
turmoil in the home country of Argentina, th e home country would be tolerable because: 
there were no demonstrations in th e streets near [the petitioner’s 
home] . . . or closed schools due to strikes. . . . [T]his alone or in 
combination with the other credible evidence in this case does not come within the grave risk exception.
272 
Other courts have established a bright line exam ple of an “intolerable situation” as one in 
which the custodial parent sexuall y abuses the child and the other parent removes the child as a 
safeguard against further abuse.273  In those instances, repatriati on to the abusing parent would 
constitute return to an “intolerab le situation.”  If there is serious  abuse or neglect, a court must

 consider whether the “court[s] in  the country of habitual reside nce, for whatever reason, may be 
incapable or unwilling to give the child adequate protection.”274 
3. Undertakings. 
Courts citing potential psychol ogical harm to the child upon return often rely on child 
psychologists as well as guardians ad litem .275  See also  Section IV.A.2.iii .  The courts will 
weigh the testimony of these individuals to determ ine the severity of the harm to the child and 
whether any measures can be taken to mitigate th e risk of psychological or physical harm to the 
child.276  If the court determines that ameliorative measures (commonly referred to as 
“undertakings”) can be taken that will allow the ch ild to return safely to the home country, the 
court will order the child’s repa triation to their home country.277    Whether undertakings can be 
implemented requires a realistic inquiry into the ab ilities of the court in th e country to which the 
child is returned. 
In Simcox v. Simcox ,278 the Sixth Circuit has outlined three “broad categories [of] cases” 
and the role of undertakings in analyzing the grave risk defense.279  First, there are “cases in 
                                                 
274 In re Application of Adan , 437 F.3d at 395 (alteration in original). 
275 See Reyes Olguin v. Cruz Santana , No. 03 CV 6299(JG), 2005 WL 67094, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 13, 
2005) (court appointed a guardian ad litem to advise the court of any potential psychological harm). 
276 Id. at *7; see Van De Sande v. Van De Sande , 431 F.3d 567, 572 (7th Cir. 2005) (remanding decision to 
district court to determine whether any conditions could be applied to protect the children if ordered to 
return to their home country); In re Tsarbopoulos , 243 F.3d 550 (Table), No. 00-35393, 2000 WL 
1721800, at *2 (9th Cir. Nov. 17, 2000) (remanding the decision to district court to determine whether 
respondent can prove a “grave risk” defense and whether district court could impose “appropriate 
protective measures as a condition of the children[‘s] return”). 
277 Reyes Olguin , 2005 WL 67094, at *7.  Some courts do not  consider such a determination to be 
dispositive in cases of child abuse.  See Van De Sande , 431 F.3d at 572 (“[I]n cases of child abuse the 
balance may shift against [undertakings] . . . it w ould seem less appropriate for the court to enter 
extensive undertakings than to deny the return request.”).

 which the abuse is relatively minor.”280  In such cases, a grave risk of harm is unlikely, and 
undertakings will be “largely irrelevant.”281  Second, in cases where there is evidence of a 
“clearly grave” risk of harm, undertak ings likely will be insufficient.282  Finally, there are cases 
that “fall somewhere in the middle,” where the a buse is “substantially more than minor, but is 
less obviously intolerable.”283  These cases will involve a fact-intensive inquiry with a focus on 
(a) “the nature and frequency of the abuse,” (b) “the likelihood of it s recurrence,” and (c) 
“whether there are any enforceable undertakings th at would sufficiently am eliorate the risk of 
harm to the child[ren] caused by [their] return.”284  The court should satisf y itself that the parties 
are likely to obey the undertakings.285 
Some of examples of the first category include McManus v. McManus ,286 where the court 
held that two incidents of a mother hittin g her children and a generally chaotic home

285 Case law suggests that a court can order undertakin gs to protect the child’s return without a proven 
grave risk defense under Article 13 .  In Kufner v. Kufner , 519 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2008), the First Circuit 
affirmed the district court’s granting of the father’s  petition to return the children to Germany and the 
lower court’s conclusion that the mother did not prov e the children would experience a grave risk of harm 
if returned.  However, the First Circuit further affi rmed the district court’s undertakings “even in the 
absence of a grave risk of harm,” including the orde ring of the father to dismiss the German criminal 
charges against the mother, to obtain medical care for one of the children and to allow the mother access 
and visitation until a German court or dered otherwise.   A mother in Krefter v. Wills , 623 F. Supp. 2d 125, 
137 (D. Mass. 2009), was unable to prove a grave risk of harm to her child; however, the court ordered 
the father to pay for the airplane tickets to German y for the child and mother; provide the mother three 
months of child support for the child; and procur e “suitable housing” for the mother and child in 
Germany.  Id.  The court explained that after these undertaki ngs were satisfied by the father, the mother 
must return to Germany with the child.  Id. The court further ordered bot h parents to “use reasonable 
efforts to schedule court proceedings” in Germany to “require minimal disruption” to the child’s 
schooling.  Id. 
286354 F. Supp. 2d 62 (D. Mass. 2005). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 58 
 environment were not enough to satisfy the grave risk defense.287  I n  Whallon v. Lynn ,288 a 
shoving incident and verbal abuse were not enough.289  In In re D.D. ,290 evidence of verbal abuse 
was insufficient to trigger the defense.291 
On the opposite end of the spectrum are cases where the abuse is so severe as to make 
undertakings insufficient.  Blondin v. Dubois292 is an example of such a case.  There, the court 
faced uncontroverted testimony that the child, if returned to Fran ce, would most certainly suffer 
a recurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder cau sed by their father’s abusive treatment of them 
while in France.293  The Second Circuit determined that no undertakings coul d ameliorate the 
danger to the children a nd thus affirmed the district court’s finding of the intolerable situation 
defense.294  I n  Danaipour v. McLarey ,295 the First Circuit  affirmed the district court’s finding 
that the mere return of the child to the father ’s country, where he had sexually abused the child, 
would cause grave harm and held that the di strict court was not re quired to explore the 
availability of ameliorative actions in that country to protect the child.296  The court found that 
proposed undertakings would prot ect the child for only a very limited time and thus were not 
sufficient to defeat the grave risk defense.297

 The Simcox  case itself is an example of the third category.  Th e court found the abuse to 
be serious in nature, both physically and psycho logically.  The incidents were not “isolated or 
sporadic,” but happened with “extreme frequency.”  Additionally, there was a “reasonable likelihood” that the abuse woul d happen again without sufficien t protection.  The court found 
undertakings to be relevant, but found that the undertakings fashi oned by the district court were 
“unworkable.”
298 
Even in “middle cases,” in or der to find that the undertakings  are sufficient to overcome 
the grave risk defense, courts of ten will assess the potential eff ectiveness of the undertakings.  
Not all courts assume that a country’s laws will be sufficient to protect the child.299  In Walsh v. 
Walsh ,300 the First Circuit sugge sted that the undertakings appro ach enables the court to explore 
the options available in the country of habitual residence in order to ensure sufficient guarantees 
of performance of the undertaki ngs.  In that case, however, the Court found that the left-behind 
father’s past acts and violation of court orders  provided the Court “every reason to believe” that 
he would violate the undertakings as well, and thus allowed the 13(b) grave risk defense and 
refused to return the child.301  In Simcox v. Simcox ,302 the court observed that a court may find 
undertakings insufficient where they are difficult to enforce.303 
If confronted with a grave risk defense,  the petitioner should assemble as much 
information as possible about the foreign c ountry’s child protective services and other

 organizations that could assist the taking parent’s and child’s safe return to the country.  The 
petitioner should be prepar ed to present proposed undertakings to the court, es pecially if the 
respondent submits credible evidence  of grave risk of harm to the child.  Finally, a petitioner also 
should be prepared to present information a bout the enforceability  of the undertakings. 
D. THE ARTICLE 13 MATURE CHILD OBJECTION TO REMOVAL DEFENSE . 
Article 13  of the Hague Convention specifically pr ovides that the court may refuse “to 
order the return of the child if it  finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an 
age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.”304  T h e  
Convention does not specify what it considers to be an appropriate age.  Therefore, some courts 
have determined that the child’s objecti on will be considered regardless of age: 
The Convention did not establish a specific age that must be 
reached before a court could fi nd that the child’s objection was 
sufficient in and of itself to declin e repatriation.  Even if a child is 
not old enough so that his objectio n could be dispositive, a court 
may consider his testimony as part  of the broader analysis under 
Article 13(b).305 
Because the inquiry concerning the mature  child objection is “fact-intensive” and 
“idiosyncratic,” decisions applying this  exception are “understandably disparate.”306  I n  Diaz 
Arboleda v. Arenas ,307 the court held that twelve- and fourteen-year-old children sufficiently 
objected to return where they e xpressed preference for staying w ith their mother and believed 
they would have better opportuni ties in the United States.308  In Man v. Cummings ,309 after an in-

2008 WL 1986253, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. May 7, 2008) (the “child ’s maturity is a question for the district court 
to be determined upon the specific facts of each case”).

 camera interview, the court honored the wishes of a thirteen-year-o ld girl to remain with her 
mother in the United States.310  In de Silva v. Pitts ,311 the Tenth Circuit affirm ed a district court’s 
decision that a thirteen-year-old had satisfied the objection defense when the child stated that he 
had made friends in the United States, describe d his house as “really big” and “a great place” 
where he has a computer and everything he need s for school, and indica ted that he thought the 
school was better here.312  Conversely, in Simcox v. Simcox ,313 the Sixth Circuit stated that 
“simply because other eight-year[-]olds have been  found to be sufficiently mature does not mean 
that the district court erred in not findi ng the same with regard to [the child].”314  Similarly, in 
Dietz v. Dietz ,315 the Fifth Circuit found that the district court did not err in hol ding that children 
aged nine and thirteen had not  attained the age and degree of  maturity at which it was 
appropriate to take account of their view in  deciding whether to return them to Mexico.316 
These decisions demonstrate that there is no hard-and-fast rule regarding the age at which 
it is appropriate for a court to take into account a child’s views.  For example, although the 
Simcox  court refused to deny return of  an objecting eight-year-old, at least one court has denied a 
petition for return where five - and eight-year-old children objected to being returned.317  On the

 other hand, at least one court has ordered return of a fifteen-year -old child, despite the child’s 
“expressed preference to remain in the United States.”318 
It is important to note that the mature child objection defense requires a different 
evidentiary standard than the grave risk defe nse and therefore must be raised separately.319  The 
mature child objection defense must be proven on ly by a preponderance of the evidence, and not 
by clear and convincing evidence.320  The McManus  court recognized that: 
Congress has added to the Convention’s endorsement of the 
exception the codicil that the factual predicate for finding that a mature objection has been made need only be established by the 
customary civil action standard of a preponderance of the evidence.  In contrast to . . . the prospect of a “grave risk” of physical or psychological harm to the child if returned, establishing the “objection” exception to return  is not subject to a stringent 
burden of proof, and thus a court may more readily find a valid objection than it could find the ex istence of a grave risk.  This 
difference in stringency of examination is expressly mandated by ICARA, 42 U.S.C. § 11603(e)(2).
321 
Nevertheless, the defense is “meant to be narrow.”322 
In McManus , the court held that the respondent’s retention of the children was wrongful 
under the Convention.  However, the court denied the petition to  return the f our children to

(B) by a preponderance of the evidence that any other exception set forth in article 12 or 13 of the 
Convention applies.

 Northern Ireland because the fourteen-year -old twins objected to their return.323  The court relied 
heavily on the advice of the guardian ad litem , a clinical psychologist.324  The psychologist, 
among other things, testified that the children we re emotionally and cognitively mature, a factor 
the court seemed to weigh heavily when determini ng the children’s ability to object coherently to 
their return.325 
Because this defense involves the child’s te stimony, there often is an issue of whether 
this testimony is the product of undue influence by the abducting parents.326  A court may not 
afford much weight to the child’s objection if th e court considers the testimony to be tainted or 
unduly influenced.327  Because there is a tendency for a child to be influenced by the preferences 
of the parent with whom he or she lives, courts “caution[] that an abducting parent should not be 
rewarded, in effect, for wrongfully retaining the child for an extensive period of time.”328  I n  
Robinson v. Robinson ,329 the court held that a ten-year-old  child’s objection wa s the “product of 
the abductor parent’s undue influence, ” and therefore was not dispositive.330 
                                                 
323 The court also denied the return of the younge r children in the family based on the guardian  ad litem’s  
opinion that they would be impacted negatively if they were returned without their older siblings.

 Courts also may find that other consider ations will overcome the mature child’s 
preferences.  In Casimiro v. Chavez ,331 the court found the uncertain immigration status of the 
child “troubling” and noted that “[ o]ther courts have cited illegal or uncertain immigration status 
among their reasons for refusing to recognize an  exception under the Hague  Convention or for 
sending a child back to her state of habitual resi dence despite her preference to remain in the 
United States.”332 
E. THE ARTICLE 20 PUBLIC POLICY DEFENSE :  RETURNING THE CHILD WOULD 
VIOLATE PUBLIC POLICY . 
Article 20  of the Hague Convention allows a court to  refuse to return a child “if doing so 
would violate fundamental principles relating to  the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms.”333  An Article 20  defense must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.334 
Article 20  is almost never invoked.  Hazbun Escaf v. Rodriquez335 is one of the only 
reported decisions in which a c ourt conducted an analysis of Article 20 .  That court noted that 
Article 20  was meant to be “restrictively interpreted and applied . . . on the rare occasion that 
return of a child would utterly shock the consci ence of the Court or o ffend all notions of due 
process”: 
The parties have not cited, nor has the Court found, any authority 
applying the Article 20 exception to  return based on “fundamental 
principles of the [United States] relating to the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms.”  This seldom cited and somewhat obscure provision wa s adopted as a compromise 
between those countries that want ed a public policy exception in 
the Convention and those that did not.  It was meant to be “restrictively interpreted and applie d . . . on the rare occasion that

 return of a child would utterly s hock the conscience of the court or 
offend all notions of due process.”336 
The Article 20  defense must be proven by clear a nd convincing evidence and never has 
been invoked successfully in the United States ; it has been invoked successfully in only a 
handful of cases internationally where the co nstitutionality of the Convention itself was 
challenged.337  One commentator has noted that Article 20  has “nearly faded without a trace,”338 
apparently because Article 20  and Article 13(b)  appear to be redundant in that, if returning the 
child would violate fundamental United States prin ciples related to human  rights, returning the 
children also would place them in an intolerable situation.339 
F. THE OFTEN -USED BUT INVALID DEFENSE : BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD . 
As discussed previously, an action under the Hague Convention is purely juri sdictional.  
Article 19  of the Convention states that “[a] d ecision under this Convention concerning the 
return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.”  
The implementing statute, ICARA, mirrors this : “[t]he Convention and this chapter empower 
courts in the United States to determine only rights under the C onvention and not the merits of 
any underlying child custody claims.”340 
Despite the clear purpose of the Hague Convention, counsel may approach the defense of 
a client as if the case were a “typical” custody disput e, in part due to lack of familiarity with the 
Hague Convention and in part because traditiona l custody arguments may be beneficial to their 
                                                 
336 Id. at 614 (quoting Public Notice 957, supra  note 6, at 10510) ; see also Aldinger v. Segler , 263 F. Supp. 
2d 284, 290 (D.P.R. 2003) (rejecting the Article 20  defense and noting that Article 20  is to be

 client’s positions.  In the United States, the “b est interests of the child” is the fundamental 
principle courts apply when determining custody of children.  The respondent likely will advance 
arguments that advocate the child’s best interests, pa rticularly if the hearing is in state court.  A 
petitioner also may make implicit best inte rests arguments by presenting evidence of the 
abducting parent’s bad actions.  It is paramount to  preserve objections rega rding a best interests 
defense because a best interests defense is not permitted by the Hague Convention. 
In Public Notice 957,341 the State Department made clear its  view that the best interests of 
the child, beyond the narrow provisions of the C onvention’s affirmative defenses, are not to 
influence a court’s determination of whether a child  should be returned to his or her country of 
habitual residence.  The State Department reasoned that “[t]he  Convention is premised upon the 
notion that the child should be promptly restored to his or her country of habitual residence so 
that a court there can examine the merits of th e custody dispute and awar d custody in the child’s 
best interests.”342 
The State Department also addressed the “best interests” argument when examining 
Article 13(b) ’s “grave risk of harm/intolerable situati on” affirmative defense to a return action.  
The State Department found that: 
This provision was not intended to  be used by defendants as a 
vehicle to litigate (or relitigate) the child’s best interests.  Only 
evidence directly establishing the existence of a grave risk that 
would expose the child to physical or emotional harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situ ation is material to the court’s 
determination.  The person opposing the child’s return must show that the risk to the child is  grave, not merely serious.

343 Id. at 10510. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 67 
 When apprised of the purpose and goals of  the Hague Convention, most courts will 
follow closely, with the understanding that “[i]n determining whether an affirmative defense 
applies, the Court must resist the temptation to engage in a custody  determination under the 
traditional ‘best interests’ test.”344  The Sixth Circuit stated that  courts applying the Convention 
have “jurisdiction to decide the merits of an a bduction claim, but not the merits of the underlying 
custody dispute,”345 and further noted that “the Hague Convention is generally intended to 
restore the pre-abduction status quo and to deter parents from crossing borders in search of a 
more sympathetic court.”346  United States courts also have held that “it is not relevant . . . who is 
the better parent in the long run, or whether the absconding pare nt had good reason to leave[.]”347 
However, while courts reject broad “best in terests” analyses as a means of avoiding 
returns under the Hague Conventi on, they recognize that certai n affirmative defenses – as 
provided by the Convention – may well overlap with the child’s be st interests.  Consider the 
following excerpt from the di strict court’s opinion in McManus v. McManus :348 
It may be objected that this is simply a “best interests of the child” 
analysis masquerading as a “matur e child’s objection” analysis.  
The answer to that objection is th at while the former is forbidden 
in proceedings under the Convention, the latter is invited.  The Convention clearly contemplates th at the objections of a mature 
child should be taken account of and can be relied on to override 
the return that would otherwis e be mandated.  Obviously, there 
may be some overlap between th e two inquiries.  One can easily 
appreciate that giving effect to the mature objection may in any 
given case also be thought to be in  the child’s best interest.  But 
that coincidence surely should not defeat application of the Article 
13 “objection” exception.  It would be absurd to conclude that the

 child’s mature objection should be honored unless  it is in the 
child’s best interest.349 
However, keep in mind that these two defenses are analytically distinct: The mature child’s 
objection is a legitimate defense enumerated under the Hague Conventi on, whereas the best 
interests of the child defense shoul d not be considered by the court. 
IV. PROCEDURAL ISSUES 
A. PROCEDURES FOR FILING AND LITIGATING A HAGUE CONVENTION RETURN 
CASE. 
1. Choice Of Court - Whether To File In Federal Or State Court. 
The procedures that apply to  a Hague Convention case ar e determined by the choice 
between federal or state court.350  Of course, the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure apply to cases 
filed in federal court.  For cases filed in state court, state procedural rules will apply.  Counsel 
also must be familiar with the local rules applic able to the particular court in which the Hague 
Convention case will be filed. 
Many practitioners recommend th at Hague Convention return cases be filed in federal 
district court, not stat e court, for the simple reason that a Hague Convention retu rn case is not 
supposed to focus on the best interests of the child but on the proper forum in which such a 
                                                 
349 Id. at 72. 
350 See 42 U.S.C. § 11603(a)  (“The courts of the States and the United States district courts shall have 
concurrent original jurisdiction of ac tions arising under the Convention.”); Yang v. Tsui , 416 F.3d 199, 
203 (3d Cir. 2005) (explaining that “[t]he Hague Conven tion proceedings can in fact be held in either 
state or federal court.  ICARA vests concurrent  jurisdiction over Hague Convention Petitions in both 
court systems.  42 U.S.C. § 11603(a) .  Thus, a state court custody pro ceeding can include consideration of 
a Hague Convention Petition.  But the petitioner is fr ee to choose between state or federal court.”). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 69 
 decision should be made.351  Federal judges are c onsidered by many to be  better equipped to 
analyze that issue, as opposed to state court j udges, who are accustomed to making best interests 
of the child determinations and who may be mo re inclined to do so  in Hague Convention 
cases.352  Accordingly, the discussion below focu ses primarily on federal procedure. 
For a comprehensive review of the procedures  that apply in federal court in a Hague 
Convention case, review the orders entered in Robles Antonio v. Barrios Bello ,353 a case litigated 
in the Northern District of Georgia and the Elev enth Circuit Court of Appeals.  These orders, 
attached as Exhibit G, detail each important pr ocedural step in a Hague Convention case, from 
                                                 
351 See, e.g. , Asvesta v. Petroutsas , 580 F.3d 1000, 1015 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that “the Convention is 
clear that a court considering a Hague petition should not  consider matters relevant to the merits of the 
underlying custody dispute such as the best interests of the child, as these considerations are reserved for 
the courts of the child’s habitual residence”); Kufner v. Kufner , 519 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2008) (stating, in 
dicta, that “the best interests of the child standard applies in custody matters and, as we previously noted, 
custody is not the issue in a Hague Convention case”); Simcox v. Simcox , 511 F.3d 594, 607 (6th Cir. 
2007) (ruling that “an inquiry that focuses on too lengthy a period of time runs the risk of turning into a 
‘child’s best interests’ analysis, which is not the proper standard under the Convention”); Yang v. Tsui , 
416 F.3d 199, 203 (3d Cir. 2005) (clarifying that “[ c]ustody litigation in state court revolves around 
findings regarding the best interest of the child, rely ing on the domestic relations law of the state court. 
An adjudication of a Hague Convention Petition focu ses on findings of where the child was habitually 
located and whether one parent wrongfully  removed or retained the child.”). 
352 Other considerations may lead to the opposite choi ce of court, and the practitioner should take into 
account all relevant factors ( e.g., client’s needs, docketing speed, familiarity, and knowledge of local 
rules) when making this decision.

 the initial grant of an ex parte temporary re straining order through the disposition of an 
emergency appeal.354 
A litigant in a Hague Convention dispute may not be afforded all the discovery tools and 
procedures that are provided by the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure.  Neither ICARA nor the 
Hague Convention require discovery or an evidentiary hearing.355  As one court stated, the 
purpose behind this denial is that  “[t]he rules of procedure appl icable to ordinary civil cases 
would seem to be at odds with the Conven tion and ICARA’s premiu m on expedited decision-
making.”356 The court concluded that discovery devices, including interrogatories and 
depositions, are “at cross-pu rposes to the [Hague Conve ntion] objective of prompt 
disposition.”357  The court treated the Hague petition as a petition for writ of habeas corpus  and 
ordered the respondent to show cause as to why the child shoul d not be returned.358 
2. The Petition For Relief Under The Hague Convention. 
(a) Preparation Of The Complaint. 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8  requires a “short and plain statement” of the Hague 
Convention claim.  However, if the petitioner seeks emergency equi table relief, he or she will

 need to submit evidence to support a grant of in junctive relief.  Such requests generally are 
governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.   All local rules govern ing emergency motions 
also must be considered. 
A verified complaint is a useful vehicle for presenting evidence to support a request for 
emergency relief; it may be styled as a “V erified Complaint/Petition Under the Hague 
Convention.”  The factual statements in a co mplaint may be verified in accordance with 
28 U.S.C. § 1746  without the need of obtaining an affi davit, which must be sworn before a 
notary public.  The ability to submit a verified statement without needin g to obtain an executed 
affidavit can be very helpful, especially if the left-behind parent is in  a foreign country when 
counsel is preparing the complaint. 
Counsel should consider attaching the follo wing types of documents to the verified 
complaint:  (1) a copy of th e Hague Convention Application;359 (2) a copy of the marriage 
certificate (if applicable); (3) a copy of the child’s birth certificate; (4 ) any report of the 
abduction from the child’s country of habitual residence, including po lice reports, INTERPOL 
notices or other foreign documents that could su pport the occurrence of an abduction; (5) copies 
of documents showing divorce or custody procee dings in other countries including, importantly, 
custody orders; (6) copies of rele vant family law codes in the foreign country that establish 
custodial rights and/or that pr ohibit removal of the child from the foreign country; and (7) any 
other documents, such as photographs and corre spondence or sworn statements from family 
members, neighbors, teachers, clergy members, and the like that support the material assertions 
in the verified complaint. 
                                                 
359 Counsel should verify the completeness and accuracy of all statements in the Hague Application prior 
to submitting it as part of the verified complaint.  If the Hague Application is incomplete or additional 
information should be included, the petitioner may need to complete a separate sworn statement. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 72 
 (b) Provisional Remedies. 
Article 7(b)  of the Hague Convention require s Central Authorities (or their 
intermediaries) to “take all appropriate measures . . . to prevent further harm to the child or 
prejudice to interested part ies by taking or causing to be taken provisional measures.”360  A  
court’s authority to gr ant provisional relief pending the fina l disposition of a Hague Convention 
case is codified in IC ARA, which provides: 
any court exercising jurisdiction of  an action brought under section 
11603(b) of this title may take or cause to be taken measures under 
Federal or State law, as appropria te, to protect the well-being of 
the child involved or to prevent the child’s further removal or 
concealment before the final disposition of the petition.361 
This section of ICARA has been interpreted to  allow a broad range of  provisional measures, 
including issuance of tem porary restraining orders , orders directing law enforcement to locate 
and immediately pick up the child , orders requiring the surrender of passports for both the child 
and abducting parents, and interim visita tion orders for the left-behind parent.  
(i) Temporary Restraining Orders/Preliminary Injunctions. 
As noted above, in federal court, the gr anting of injunctive relief is governed by Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 65 .  As a general matter, counsel will need to present a motion and 
supporting brief, as well as evidence supporting th e request for injunctive relief.  The evidence 
can be in the form of a verified complaint, declarations pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746  or 
affidavits, or all of the above.  Again, counsel should ensure that pleadings comply with the 
district court’s rules governing the presentation of emergency motions. 
The circumstances governing Hague Convention cases sometimes demand requests for ex 
parte  emergency relief.  The standards governing such extraordinary requests are set out in 
                                                 
360 See Hague Convention, supra  note 2, art. 7(b) . 
361 42 U.S.C. § 11604(a) . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 73 
 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b) .  In Robles I , ex parte  emergency relief was granted to 
prevent irreparable harm where: (1) the respo ndent already had abducted the child from the 
familial home in Mexico and smuggled the child into the United States; (2) the respondent faced 
the risk of apprehension in the United States; an d (3) there was the possibility if the child was not 
removed from the respondent’s custody that the respondent would further secret the child and 
herself.362 
Requests for emergency relief must be presente d to and resolved by the trial court on an 
expedited basis.  As a general matter, counsel will need to file a proper emergency motion with 
the court before an emergency hearing can be scheduled.  Some courts, however, will schedule 
emergency hearings on the representation of couns el that the emergency motion will be filed in 
advance of the hearing.  As noted above, the main procedural vehicles for presenting an 
emergency motion are either a motion for an ex parte  TRO (a restraining order entered without 
notice to the adverse party) or a motion for a TRO or preliminary injunction (emergency 
injunctive relief entered with notice to the adverse party).  In some courts, the procedure for 
obtaining ex parte  relief is referred to as an “order to show cause” or “rule nisi.”  Whatever the 
label, counsel must be familiar with the proper vehicle through which to present a request for emergency relief before attempting to schedule an emergency hearing with the trial court. 
Regarding preliminary injunctions, keep in  mind that the cour t can be asked to 
consolidate the hearing on the preliminary injunc tion motion with a hearing on the merits of the 
case pursuant to Rule 65(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
.  The district court did so 
in Robles Antonio v. Barrios Bello .363

 (ii) Obtaining Custody of the Child. 
The decision whether to seek emergency cu stody of the child often is a difficult and 
important aspect of an emergency Hague Conventi on case.  Courts are usua lly very hesitant to 
order the immediate location and pi ck up of child absent credible evidence that the child is in 
danger or may be removed from the jurisdiction.  ICARA states that “[n]o court exercising 
jurisdiction of [a Hague action] . . . may . . . or der a child remove d from a person having physical 
control of the child unless the applicable  requirements of Stat e law are satisfied.”364  Federal and 
state judges usually look to the provisions of their state’s Uniform Ch ild Custody Jurisdiction 
and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)365 for authority to request emerge ncy relief and specifically for 
the ability to issue a warrant for the pick up of  the child.  The provision s of the UCCJEA vary 
from state to state, but typica lly require a showing that the child will su ffer imminent physical 
harm or will be removed from the state immediately.366  For more information about the 
UCCJEA, see Section V . 
Generally, the United States Marshals Serv ice is the agency that executes federal 
warrants and is accustomed to taking people into custody and presenting them to federal judges 
in federal district court proceedings.367  They are not, however, in  the business of caring for 
children.  Ideally, the petitioner will be present to  care for the child after the child is taken into 
custody.  In practice, however, this is not always  possible.  Counsel for the petitioner should plan

366 Id. at § 311(a) (“Upon the filing of a petition seeking enfo rcement of a child custody determination, the 
petitioner may file a verified application for the issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child 
if the child is immediately likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this State.”). 
367 E.g., Fawcett v. McRoberts , 168 F. Supp. 2d 595, 597 (W.D. Va. 2001) (following an ex parte  hearing,

custody and present them to the Court for an initial hearing). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 75 
 enforcement can turn over the child.  In the ev ent that no family members are available, the 
petitioner may propose appropriate friends or adu lts who have a pre-existing relationship with 
the child.  If no other options exis t, law enforcement may need to place the child in the care of 
the appropriate child protective se rvices agency.  In that situa tion, counsel should propose orders 
clearly indicating that the placem ent is temporary and lasts only until the petitioner or one of the 
above named persons is available to care for the child.  Child protective  service agencies are 
accustomed to providing temporary care to children when a parent or guardian is unavailable.  It is important for the practitioner to use adva nce communication and pr ovide clear judicial 
instructions in the context of a pending Hague pe tition, where there may not  be traditional facts 
requiring the agency to ta ke protective custody ( e.g., abandonment, abuse, or neglect) to help 
prevent the situation from becoming a full-blown dependency proceeding.  See Section IV.C.6
 
for additional information. 
In Robles Antonio v. Barrios Bello , the relief was structured in a way consistent with the 
function of the United States Marshals Service.  The district court ordered the Marshals to take 
physical custody of the child and bring the child to  the magistrate judge.  The magistrate judge 
then was required to arrange for the child to be  placed in the temporary physical custody of the 
petitioner (the biological fathe r) under appropriate conditions.368  The magistrate judge required 
the petitioner to surrender  his passport, make the minor chil d available for a private interview 
with the appointed guardian  ad litem , and appear at the preliminar y injunction hearing with the 
child on pain of contempt.369

 (iii) Guardian  Ad Litem  Appointments. 
Frequently, the abducting parent will  ask the court to appoint a guardian  ad litem  to 
safeguard the interests of the child during the pe ndency of the litigation, or the court will make 
such appointment sua sponte .  State court judges, who regularly  hear contested custody matters, 
often rely on guardians  ad litem  to provide the court with an independent and unbiased source of 
information about the child so th at they can determine how the child’s best interests will be 
served.  Federal court judges, who are unaccustomed  to hearing parental disputes over children, 
often are even more inclined to seek the advice of  someone who is not beholden to either parent.  
The lawyer representing the left-behind parent is placed in the position of either opposing such 
an appointment and seeming insensitive to th e child’s needs or addressing a guardian  ad litem’s  
recommendation that may encompass best interests factors or other issues pertaining to the child 
that are outside the scope of a Hague Convention case. 
There are many factors that make this a va lid concern.  Often, th e child’s country of 
habitual residence cannot provide the child with a standard of living comparable to that in the 
United States.  There may be greater political unr est in the child’s  home country than here.  The 
abducting parent may not have the resources to return  to the habitual reside nce to see the child or 
to litigate custody there.  The child’s state of mind about return to the home country and 
relationship to the left-behind pa rent may be affected by the sepa ration and/or in fluenced by the 
abducting parent.  Unless instructed otherwise, these issues naturally will concern a guardian  ad 
litem . 
There are few cases that discuss the propriety of appointing a guardian ad litem .  The 
case of Hasan v. Hasan370 is helpful when seeking to oppose such an appointment.  In that case, 
                                                 
370 No. Civ. A. 03-11960-GAO, 2004 WL 57073 (D. Mass. Jan. 13, 2004). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 77 
 the court refused to designate a guardian  ad litem , finding that “it would be inappropriate for this 
court to litigate the best intere sts of the children or to deci de the merits of any underlying 
custody dispute.”371 
Although there is a real po ssibility that a guardian  ad litem  recommendation will include 
best interests factors, it may be a better practi ce not to oppose such appoint ments, particularly if 
the judges in the jurisdiction ar e likely to appoint a guardian ad litem  anyway.  Instead, counsel 
may assist the court with narrowly defining the role of the guardian ad litem  to focus on specific 
appropriate inquiries within the context of the Hague Convention.  Even with appropriate 
direction and focus, a guardian ad litem’s  opinion is likely to have a powerful influence on a 
judge’s decision and may or may not be  beneficial to the client’s case. 
In McManus v. McManus ,372 the court relied upon the guardian  ad litem’s assessment of 
the children’s maturity in deciding whether to consider their wishes to remain in the United 
States.  Where the defense included the mature children’s objection, the guardian  ad litem  found 
the two older children (ages fourteen and fifteen ) to be “cognitively and emotionally mature” and 
“capable of independent thought,” which the court re lied upon in refusing to return the children 
to their country of habitual residence.373  The court also denied the return of the younger children 
in reliance upon the guardian  ad litem’s  opinion that the younger childr en in the family would be 
impacted negatively if they were re turned without thei r older siblings.374  I n  Casimiro v. 
Chavez ,375 the guardian ad litem  was asked to evaluate a fifteen-year-old’s capability for mature 
decision-making.  Although the guardian  ad litem  and the court both found the teen to be

 sufficiently mature, the court returned her after finding that the abducting family had influenced 
her.376 
The guardian  ad litem can be a powerful ally for the petitioner or can complicate the 
petitioner’s position.  A guardian ad litem  in a Hague Convention case is working at an 
accelerated rate, and it is important  to provide that person with as much information as quickly 
as possible so that they can understand the pe titioner’s and the child’s positions.  If an 
unfavorable recommendation based on the best in terests of the child is made, careful cross-
examination designed to elicit an impermissibl e focus may help mitigate that influence. 
(c) Notice and Service of the Hague Convention Petition. 
Notice and service of Hague Convention petitions are govern ed by the normal rules for 
service of process.377  While proper service of process is ne cessary for a court to obtain personal 
jurisdiction over the respondent an d requires the responde nt to answer the co mplaint, keep in 
mind that, as a general matter, it is not necessary that a complaint be formally served before a 
trial court can order injunctive relief.378 
In emergency situations, counsel can ask the district court to order the United States 
Marshals Service to serve the complain t and emergency papers, as was done in Robles .  As 
mentioned previously, this service can be si multaneous to or following the pick-up of the 
children.  However, ideally, pick up should occur ju st prior to service to prevent confrontation or 
flight.

378 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(1) (“The court may issue a preliminar y injunction only on notice to the 
adverse party.”). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 79 
 (d) Discovery. 
The normal discovery rules apply in Hague C onvention cases; however, if discovery is 
necessary, the petitioners or the respondents may need to request expedited discovery.379  Federal 
district courts have the discre tion to order expedited discovery.380  Expedited discovery is 
particularly appropriate in ca ses involving requests for emergenc y equitable relief, such as 
preliminary injunctions.381  As a general matter, the standard  for obtaining expedited discovery is 
the showing of good cause.382  In seeking expedited discovery in a Hague Convention case, 
counsel should cite to language in the Hague Convention directing the prompt resolution of these 
matters as well as similar language in Hague  Convention cases.  Expedited discovery is 
appropriate where it would “better enable the cour t to judge the parties’ interests and respective 
chances for success on the merits” at  a preliminary injunction hearing.383 
                                                 
379 As discussed earlier in this Manua l, litigants in Hague Conventions disputes often are not permitted to 
engage in a full discovery process.  See supra , p. 68. 
380 See Fimab-Finanziaria Maglificio Biellese Fratelli Fila S.p.A. v. Helio Import/Export, Inc. , 601 F. 
Supp. 1, 3 (S.D. Fla. 1983) (“Expedited discovery shou ld be granted when some unusual circumstances or 
conditions exist that would likely prejudice the party if he were required to wait the normal time.”). 
381 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 Adv. Comm. Note  (“Discovery can begin earlier if authorized . . .  This will be 
appropriate in some cases, such as those involvi ng requests for a preliminary injunction. . . .”); see also

, 917 F. Supp. 841, 844 (D.D.C. 1996) (stating that “expedited 
discovery is particularly appropriate when a plai ntiff seeks injunctive relief because of the expedited 
nature of injunctive proceedings”); Ga. Gazette Publ’g Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. , 562 F. Supp. 1000, 1004

affidavits, documents, and exhibits for further develo pment of the record before a preliminary injunction 
hearing). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 80 
 Aside from requests for expedited discover y, Hague Convention requests might make it 
appropriate to seek more non-typical forms of discovery, such as telephonic depositions.  
Telephone depositions may be take n pursuant to a stipulation of the parties or a court order.384 
(e) Evidentiary Issues. 
The normal rules of evidence apply in Hague  Convention cases, even though the overall 
objective of the Hague Convention and ICARA – to  return abducted children to their habitual 
residence as soon as practicable  – is not typical litigation.385  In fact, the Sixth Circuit has gone 
so far as to uphold a tr ial court’s decision that: 
[t]here is no requirement under th e Hague Convention or under the 
ICARA that discovery be allowed or  that an evidentiary hearing be 
conducted. Thus, under the guidan ce of the Convention and the 
statutory scheme, the court is give n the authority to resolve these 
cases without resorting to a full trial on the merits or a plenary evidentiary hearing.
386 
Going one step further, the Sixth Circuit held that the Convention “provides that a court may 
order return of a child at any time, not withstanding proof of treaty defenses.”387 
The Hague Convention and ICARA have a numb er of provisions en suring that return 
proceedings are handled in the most efficien t manner possible.  For example, the Hague 
                                                 
384 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(7) . 
385 To ensure that judges have as much information as  possible regarding procedural issues arising in 
Hague Convention cases, both the U.S. State Department  and the Hague Permanent Bureau offer articles, 
fact sheets, best practice guides, and other j udicial guidance regarding Hague Convention cases.  See State 
Department Information for Attorneys and Judges ( http://travel.state.gov/abduc tion/attorneysjudges/

available to assist in judicial communications regarding Hague Convention cases (http://www.hcch.net/upload/haguenetwork.pdf
), as well as publishing the qu arterly Judge’s Newsletter 
on International Child Protection ( http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php? act=publications.listing&sub=5 ).

administrative authority to order the re turn of the child at any time.”)). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 81 
 Convention provides flexible rule s regarding authentication of documents and judicial notice.388  
The implementing legislation also provi des a generous au thentication rule.389  These provisions 
serve to expedite rulings on petitions and return wrongfully removed or retained children to their 
habitual residence.390  Many courts attempt to resolve evid entiary issues that arise in Hague 
Convention cases pragmatically.391  It is not uncommon for a ma gistrate judge to handle the 
evidentiary hearing in an effort to expedite th e calendaring of the heari ng and resolution of the 
case.392 
(f) Witnesses (Including Experts). 
As a factual matter, the showing that peti tioners must make to establish a case of 
wrongful removal is  straightforward.393  The showing that responde nts are required to make, 
however, might require the introduction of expert te stimony, such as establis hing that the return 
of children would “expose [them] to physical or ps ychological harm or othe rwise place [them] in 
an intolerable situation.”394  Under the Federal Rules, parties are required to disclose the identity

court.”).

 of expert witnesses, such as e xpert psychiatrists and psychologists, and disclo se the nature of the 
anticipated testimony.395 
In terms of securing the testimony of witne sses, the normal rules apply.  Depositions of 
witnesses may be taken and used in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32(a) .  For 
live testimony, whether at a live hearing, such as a hearing on a preliminary injunction motion, 
or at trial, it might be necessary to serve witnes ses with a subpoena to compel their attendance.  
As a practical matter, testimony often extends th e length of the trial and can place an extra 
burden on the petitioner to produce rebuttal witnesse s, which often can be costly and difficult to 
procure in a short period of time, especially if supporting witnesses reside in the foreign country.  
The court should be reminded that the introducti on of expert witnesse s may undermine the goal 
of expeditious litigation of Ha gue Convention disputes and may be unnecessary and irrelevant, 
depending on the scope of the witnesses’ testimony. 
3. Article 16 Stay Of Pending State Court Action. 
Article 16  supplements and reinforces the basic mandate of the Hague Convention: 
custody disputes should be deci ded in the country of habitual  residence only after a Hague 
petition is decided.396Article 16  explicitly provides, among ot her things, that once a court 
receives notice of a potential wrongful removal or  pending Hague application, “the judicial or 
administrative authorities of the Contracting Stat e to which the child ha s been removed or in 
which it has been retained shall not decide on the merits of ri ghts of custody until is has been 
determined that the child is not to be returned under this Convention.”397  For purposes of this 
                                                 
395 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2) . 
396 See Ruiz v. Tenorio , 392 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2004) (holdi ng that “[t]he court’s inquiry is limited 
to the merits of the abduction claim and not th e merits of the underlying custody battle.”). 
397 Hague Convention, supra  note 2, art. 16 . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 83 
 Manual, this issue most often arises when Ha gue Convention Applicatio ns are filed during the 
pendency of state court custody proceedings.398 
In cases where federal Hague Convention proc eedings and state custody proceedings are 
concurrent, it is the state court, not federal court, proceedings that should “be held in 
abeyance.”399  Even assuming, arguendo , the state court moves forward and issues a custody 
determination, it is of no import to a pe nding federal court Hague Convention case.400  A s  a  
practical matter, state court cu stody cases often do not reach the merits or render decisions on 
critical elements of any Hague Convention ca se, such as whether a removal was “wrongful.”401 
At least one court has held, however, that  federal jurisdiction over Hague Convention 
proceedings does not translate into the power to enjoin concurrent state court custody 
proceedings.402  In short, the plain language of Article 16  provides enough authority for a state 
court sua sponte  to suspend any custody determination pending a Hague Convention hearing.  
                                                 
398 More often than not, cases involving concurrent state and federal proceedings result in detailed 
analyses involving abstention doctrines or preclusion principles.  We do not explore these issues in this 
Manual.

authority for me to stay the state court decision. Ho wever, Article 16 applies to  custody determinations 
made by courts in the state to which a child was wrongfully removed or is wrongfully retained, not the 
state of habitual residence. Here, the custody dete rmination was made by a Wisconsin state court, the 
United States is alleged to be the state of habitual  residence for purposes of the Convention, and therefore 
Article 16 is inapplicable.”).

4. Checklist Of Activities. 
Counsel should consider the following ite ms in preparing for the first hearing: 
(1) Obtain copies of the following documents: 
(a) the Hague Application or petition; (b) the Hague Convention; (c) ICARA; (d) the child’s birth certificates; 
(e) any marriage, divorce, and custody documents; 
(f) any relevant civil code documents  pertaining to cu stody (certified 
documentation is preferable); 
(g) an abduction report from the child’s c ountry of habitual residence, if one 
exists; 
(h) all supporting documents if the complaint is verified, including 
photographs and school and medi cal records for the child; 
(i) proof of service; and (j) financial information to support a waiver of court fees. 
(2) If filing for emergency relief, file the petition as an emergency motion and 
schedule an emergency heari ng, which requires:  an ex parte  TRO or motion for a 
TRO for a preliminary injunction and a supporting brief with evidence supporting 
the need for a TRO, e.g., an affidavit.  Consider requesting that the TRO be

 consolidated with a hearing on the mer its.  Samples of common pleadings and 
filings in Hague cases, including sample TR O motions and briefs, are attached as 
Exhibit H . 
(3) To obtain physical custody of the children: 
(a) file a motion for the court to order the United States Marshals Service (or 
other law enforcement agency, if filing in state court) to take physical custody of the child and bring the child before the court to arrange for temporary custody; and 
(b) file a motion to oppose or limit the appointment of a guardian  ad litem  
(see Section IV.A.2.(b)(iii)
). 
(4) If applicable, file the following motions: 
(a) motion requesting waiver of court fees based on indigency of client; 
(b) motion requesting expedited discovery; 
(c) motion requesting teleph onic depositions/testimony; 
(d) motion opposing expert witnesses; (e) motion requesting interim visitation with the child; and (f) motion to stay a custody  action filed by respondent. 
(5) File a sample return order for the court.  Include specific timelines for return and 
purchase of airline tickets to ensure that  the abducting parent does not flee with 
the child following the issu ance of the return order. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 86 
 B. APPEALS . 
Article 11  of the Hague Convention instructs judici al authorities to “act expeditiously in 
proceedings for the return of children.”404  As applied to appellate practice, the Judges’ Seminar 
on the 1980 Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child A bduction concluded that 
“[t]he obligation to process return applications expeditiously extends also  to appeal procedures” 
and “appellate courts should set and adhere to tim etables that ensure a speedy determination of 
return applications.”405  Accordingly, appellate courts are charged expressly w ith expediting the 
appeals process. 
1. Standard Of Review. 
Appellate courts review the lower court’s fa ctual findings for clear error and the lower 
court’s interpretation of the Ha gue Convention and application of  the Hague Convention to the 
facts de novo .406 
2. If The Trial Court Stays Its Order Returning The Child. 
If the trial judge issues an order granting the return of the child, the respondent likely will 
appeal the order in open court and move for an  emergency order staying the judgment pending 
appeal.  This is necessary both to prevent the ch ild from leaving the country and to preserve the 
party’s right to move the appellate court for a stay of the judgment pursuant to Rule 8 of the 
Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure .407  Obtaining a stay of the lower court’s judgment is 
essential for the respondent because, unless otherw ise provided by the court, the order granting

 the return of a child is effective immediately, with no ten-day automatic stay pursuant to Rule 62 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .408  According to the Sixth Circuit, “staying the return of 
a child in an action under the [Hague] Convention should hardly be a matter of course” because 
“[t]he aim of the Conventi on is to secure prompt return of th e child to the corre ct jurisdiction and 
any unnecessary delay renders the subsequent retu rn more difficult for the child, and subsequent 
adjudication more difficult for the foreign court.”409 
If the trial court denies the motion to stay the order to return the child, the respondent 
might file an emergency motion for stay pending a ppeal with the appellate court to prevent the 
child from being removed.  A stay pending app eal has been described as an “exceptional” 
remedy and will be granted only upon evaluating the following factors on a sliding scale:  (1) the 
movant is likely to prev ail on the merits on appeal; (2) abse nt a stay, the m ovant will suffer 
irreparable damage; (3) the nonmovant will suffer no substantial harm from the issuance of the 
stay; and (4) the public interest will be served by issuing the stay.410  The first factor necessarily 
places the court in a difficult position because a court “‘would not have ruled as [it] did in the 
first place’” if it believed an appeal would be successful.411  Therefore, the party seeking an 
appeal can satisfy this factor by showing that it has “a substantial case on the merits.”412  The 
second factor, irreparable harm, can be shown by dem onstrating that the child could be at risk of 
being harmed physically, or that the movant will suffer irreparable harm because the court likely

 would find that the return  of the child moots the appeal.  Th e third factor merely requires the 
moving party to demonstrate that no other party will suffer substantial injury should the court decide to issue a stay.  The final factor, which re lates to the public interest, is perhaps the most 
difficult to overcome, because “[a]llowing for a st ay pending appeal would run contrary to the 
public interest of securing the prompt  return of wrongfu lly removed children.”
413  In spite of the 
difficulty of demonstrating any of the four factor s, if an appellate cour t grants such a motion, it 
may enter an order temporarily granting the mo tion for stay and temporarily enjoining the 
removal of the child pending its review of the trial court’s order.414 
3. Appeals May Be Mooted By The Child’s Return. 
The appellate courts are in disagreement re garding an appeal’s mootness once the child 
has been returned to the country of his or her hab itual residence.  This analysis is linked closely 
with “irreparable injury,” one of the factors courts use to weigh the appropriateness of granting a 
stay. 
If the case is in a circuit following the rule that return of the child does not moot an 
appeal, the petitioner shoul d argue that a stay of the trial cour t’s order is unnecessa ry to preserve 
the appeal because a return of the child will not  moot the appeal.  If the case is in a circuit 
following the rule that return of the child moots an appeal, the respondent  may argue that he or 
she would suffer irreparable harm if the request fo r a stay is denied, sin ce a refusal to stay the 
case will effectively end the case if the child is re turned.  Such an analysis is closely linked with 
“irreparable injury,” factor number two above.  The petitioner should respond by arguing that the 
respondent will not succeed on the merits on appeal , and thus the return should be prolonged by 
granting a stay. 
                                                 
413 Id. at *3. 
414 Id. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 89 
 Below is a discussion of the split among the ap pellate courts regardi ng whether return of 
the child moots appeal. 
(a) Return of the Child Moots an Appeal. 
In Bekier v. Bekier ,415 the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the removal of the child from the 
court’s jurisdiction mooted the a ppeal, thus requiring that the a ppeal be dismissed.  The court 
explained that a reversal of the district court’s order would not pr ovide the petitioning party with 
actual affirmative relief because the child already had been returned to the country of habitual 
residence.416  Therefore, the Bekier  court found that to avoid dismissal of an appeal as moot, the 
party appealing a judgment ordering the return of a child must obtain a stay of that judgment. 
Making a slight departure from the Eleventh Circuit’s analysis, th e Tenth Circuit also 
held that an appeal was re ndered moot after a child wa s returned to  England in Navani v. 
Shahani .417  However, the Tenth Circuit emphasized th at the appeal was moot not only because 
the child had been returned to England, but also, and pe rhaps more importantly, because the 
English court – which maintained jurisdiction to decide the custody matter – subsequently issued 
a new custody order.418  The court’s reasoning leads the reader  to believe that the appeal might 
not have been considered moot had the English court failed to decide the custody matter on the 
merits. 
While not directly answ ering the question of whether the child’s return moots an appeal, 
the decision to order a brief stay  occasionally suggests that the re turn of the child would moot an 
                                                 
415 248 F.3d 1051 (11th Cir. 2001).

418 Id. at 1127-29. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 90 
 appeal.  For example, in Haimdas v. Haimdas ,419 the court stated that it was “inclined to deny  a 
stay pending appeal” just prior to staying the enforcement of the judgment for a month, in an 
effort to enable the respondent to request an emergency stay and expedited treatment of his 
appeal.420  Similarly, the court in Olesen-Frayne v. Olesen421 found that a stay was inappropriate 
just prior to granting a limited, week-long stay “in order to give respondent the opportunity to 
seek a stay from the appr opriate appellate court, should he choose to do so.”422  Both of these 
courts failed to specify expressly that the child ren’s returns, which already had been ordered, 
would moot the appeals; however , both courts recognized the need  for the appealing parents to 
take action prior to the children’s returns. 
(b) Return of the Child does not  Moot an Appeal. 
In trying to decipher which wa y the courts are shifting in  the “moot” or “not moot” 
debate, the past few years have illustrated a slight shift toward holding that the return of the child 
does not  moot an appeal.  For example, in Whiting v. Krassner ,423 the Third Circuit held that 
where a father failed to win a stay pending appeal  and his child was returned to her mother in 
Canada, the appeal was not moot.  The cour t explained “nothing [h ad] occurred during the 
pendency of this appeal that [made] it impossibl e for the court to gran t any effectual relief 
what[so]ever.”424  This sentiment was echoed by the court in Wasniewski v. Grzelak-
Johannsen ,425 where it stated that “[a]n appeal from  a decision under the Hague Convention does

 not become moot merely because a child is returned to the cust ody of the petitioner in a foreign 
country…Rather, the appeal may proceed as any other appeal.  Because [Respondent] may 
proceed with her appeal absent a stay, Respon dent, as the movant, faces no irreparable harm 
absent a stay.”426 
4. Post-Appeal Considerations. 
Most importantly, once an order for return has been entered, the party requesting the 
child’s return should begin making travel arrangemen ts so that the client and the child can leave 
the country as soon as possible.  Even if the app eal technically is not mooted by the return of the 
child, it would be significantly more difficult to enforce an order from an appellate court 
reversing the lower court’s judgment once the child  has been returned to a foreign country.  
Practitioners in this situation must be mindful of their professional duties to the court when a 
client willfully disregards an appellate court’s reversal of an order to return the child.  If a client is held in contempt for violati ng an appellate court order, the pr actitioner may have to move to 
withdraw or consider other measur es regarding their representation.

HE LOGISTICS OF HANDLING A HAGUE CONVENTION CASE. 
1. Introduction. 
The logistics of handling a Hague Conventi on case can be as complex, challenging and 
time-consuming as analyzing the legal aspects.   This Section provides insight on how to 
                                                 
426 Id. at *7 (internal citations omitted); see also Kufner v. Kufner , 519 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2008) 
(rejecting father’s motion to dismiss mother’s app eal as moot because “the appeal presents a live 
controversy”); Vale, 2008 WL 2246929, at *3 (“there is no basis for this Court to conclude that 
Respondent’s appeal would be moot after the child ren were returned to Venezuela”).  Also, in Sasson v. 
Shenhar , the Supreme Court of Virginia dismissed a fa ther’s appeal of the denial of his Hague 
Convention petition because the father absconded to Spain w ith the child and refused to return the child to 
the United States.  667 S.E.2d 555 (Va. 2008).  The court dismissed the appeal, relying on the Fugitive 
Disentitlement Doctrine. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 92 
 anticipate, prepare for, and reso lve common logistical issues that  arise in both return and access 
cases. 
2. The Investigation. 
The top priority is locating the child.  After the Office of Children’s Issues of the State 
Department receives a Hague Application, a case officer is assigned to help the left-behind 
parent with locating the child.  The State Depa rtment collaborates with various entities and 
agencies to help with the process, including N on-Governmental Organizations (“NGOs”) such as 
International Social Service (“ISS”), the Fede ral Bureau of Investig ation, the In ternational 
Criminal Police Organization (“INTERPOL”),  and individual states’ missing-child 
clearinghouses.  The State Department also wo rks with The National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children to create media awareness th at can be highly useful in locating abducted 
children.  The left-behind parent must provide the Office of Children’s Issues with as much 
helpful information as possible, such as wher eabouts of relatives and places of employment, 
business connections, etc. regarding the abducting parent.  The accuracy of the information regarding the potential location( s) of a missing child or an a bducting parent is dependent upon 
many factors.  Information regard ing a potential location can become  stale due to the passage of 
time between the State Department’s location of  the abducting parent and missing child and the 
retention of counsel by the left-b ehind parent.  The abducting parent also may move frequently 
due to a lack of resources, have transitory living accommodations with relatives and friends, 
have difficulty enrolling children in school, have illegal immigra tion status, and have a general 
fear of detection by law enforcement.  These ar e additional factors that counsel should consider. 
Judges faced with the unique  circumstances of Hague Convention cases may demand 
verification of the parents’ and child’s presence within the court’s jurisdiction.  It therefore is 
best to conduct an independent investigation in anticipation of  the court’s questions.  At a NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 93 
 minimum, counsel should verify the identifica tion of the abducting parent, the presence of the 
child in the jurisd iction, any school or day ca re attended by the child, and the existence of any 
public records confirming their presence in the jurisdiction (such as criminal or property 
records). 
Private investigators may be a valuable resour ce as well.  Larger law firms frequently 
have private investigators with law enforcement experience in their empl oy or under contract.  
They may be able to tap into their contacts to  locate the child quickly, although law enforcement 
agencies and NGOs may have limitations on the information they are able to share with private investigators.  Local law enforcement officers also  can be a great asset to such an investigation, 
as they have in-depth knowledge of the comm unity, the power of the badge, subpoena power to 
obtain public records, and ultimately wield arrest authority.  However, the benefits of law enforcement assistance should always be bala nced against the possibi lity of alerting the 
abducting parents that law enforcem ent is interested in the child. 
3. Initial Conversation/Interview With Clients. 
Before helping prospective client s to find an affordable or a pro bono  attorney, the State 
Department tries to achieve a voluntary return of the child.  If that fails, the State Department 
sends outreach letters to attorneys who have ag reed to consider representation.  The outreach 
letters contain basic information, such as the co untry involved, the gender of the parent seeking 
representation, and whether the particular case is an access or return case.  Generally, the State 
Department does not provide attorneys with a dditional information about cases before the 
attorneys speak to the potential client.  Howeve r, if attorneys request additional information 
before speaking to a potential client, the State Department will release additional information from the file if the Application expressly permits such a release.  Next, the left-behind parent is NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 94 
 walked through the legal process in the United States and pr ovided with a lis t of potential 
attorneys who have agreed to speak to him or  her and the attorneys’ contact information. 
The first communication w ith the left-behind parent will be the opportunity to establish 
an attorney-client relationship.  If the client does not speak English, it is essential to have a 
translator present during that initial phone c onversation between counsel  and the prospective 
client.  The translator can be anyone who is fluent in both la nguages and does no t have to be 
certified or sanctioned by the c ourt.  The State Department al so will aid in coordinating the 
initial call through the La nguage Line, a telephonic in terpretation service. 
Counsel should aim to provide the parent wi th concise but clear information regarding 
the Hague Convention and the legal process, se tting aside two hours for the first communication 
with the left-behind client.  Th is may need to occur outside of  normal business hours so that the 
client can have the conversation privately and away  from co-workers.  It is critical however, to 
obtain a detailed timeline of events and identi fy the existence of any supporting documents 
during the very first call.  This will help both counsel and the client become familiar with the 
specifics of the case and required efforts.  Counsel  also should explain the best and worst case 
scenarios, as well as the available remedies.  It  is essential to inquir e about the child’s birth 
certificate and any court documents concerning pare ntage or custody.  Also consider whether any 
court documents will need to be translated.  Discuss gathering documentation of the child’s 
habitual residence in that c ountry, including school and doctor records, photographs and videos 
of the child with family and friends, and ev idence of any involvement in extracurricular 
activities. 
It is important to gain an understanding of the relationship between the parents, between 
the clients and the child, and amongs t the relatives.  It is important to probe  the client about the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 95 
 likely substance of the respondent’s case.  Inquire  about criminal records, domestic violence, 
immigration issues, and other lega l issues that may be raised.  Request any documents that may 
be relevant to these issues.  Counsel should take an opportunity duri ng the follow-up call to 
prepare the client for the potential ly explosive allegations  that the abductor ma y make at trial.  
Although these issues may not be relevant to a Hague Convention case, the abductor may allege 
them nonetheless. 
Counsel also should address the petitioner’s ab ility to travel to the United States for a 
hearing.  Does the client have a passport?  Are there visa requirements?  Are there any 
immigration-related impediments to the client’s abili ty to travel to the he aring?  Is the client 
financially able to travel?  Does the client have work or family obligations that affect the ability 
to travel on short notice?  Effort s to expedite the visa process for the left-behind parent once a 
hearing is scheduled may be necessary.  Consul ates and Embassies become key players and can 
provide significant help to resolve these issues in a prompt manner.  If the client cannot travel, 
are there relatives or other persons who can trav el instead?  These persons must have detailed 
knowledge of the family, authority to act on the pe titioner’s behalf, and mu st be familiar to the 
child for their presence to be effective. 
Counsel also should discuss the petitioner’s ability to pay for their travel or that of a 
substituting relative and for the return of the child.  Does the client have relatives or friends in 
the jurisdiction, or will a hotel be needed?  Are there any specia l medical, work-related, or other 
issues that will impact the client’s travel? 
After the initial call, the State Department will provide additional case information to 
counsel so that counsel can decide whether to  accept the representation.  Generally, the State 
Department provides the Hague Ap plication and custody documents such as the custody order.  NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 96 
 If the State Department sent a return letter on behalf of the left-behind parent, the State 
Department will provide counsel with the return letter and any response received.  Counsel also 
may request additional information such as a birth certificate or marriage certificate. 
Once counsel is retained and the engagement  letter is signed, the State Department 
provides counsel with  the entire file. 
4. Checklist Of Items To Discuss Duri ng The Client Call For Retention 
Of Counsel. 
Counsel should consider the following ite ms relating to the first client call: 
(1) Get an interpreter, if necessary. (2) Explain the following: 
(a) characteristics of the court proce dures of a Hague Convention case so the 
client is aware of the general timeline; 
(b) best and worst case scenarios; (c) lack of service; (d) civil and criminal remedies; and (e) the jurisdictional, not custodial, focus of the Hague Convention case. 
(3) Ask the client if he or she has emotional support and consider offering referrals to 
support services in the United States such as NCMEC’s Team HOPE (Help 
Offering Parents Empowerment)
427 and referrals to reuni fication specialists, and 
other non-profit organizations.  Check with  NCMEC and the State Department for 
up-to-date information on this matter. 
                                                 
427 The official website for NCMEC’s Team HOPE is http://www.teamhope.org .  NCMEC’s Team HOPE 
may be contacted at 1-866-305-HOPE. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 97 
 (4) Ask the left-behind parent for a detailed  timeline of events and a summary leading 
up to the abduction, including: (a) a timeline of the child’s previous residences from birth to present; 
(b) all contact the client has had with the child; (c) the relationship among the parent s, child, and other relatives; 
(d) any law enforcement or social se rvices intervention with the family, 
including any complaints made by the taking parent relating to abuse, 
neglect or domestic violence; 
(e) the immigration status  and other legal issues; 
(f) supporting documents, including:  the child’s birth certificates, the 
parents’ divorce and/or marriage cer tificates (if applicable); and any 
custody orders, mediated agreements, or  civil codes rela ting to custodial 
rights. 
(5) Ask the client for all documents suppor ting a habitual reside nce determination, 
including travel authorizations or ot her signed agreements, school and medical 
records, photos and/or videos of the child, and evidence of  participation in 
extracurricular activities including day care, sports and church activities. 
(6) If the child may be in danger or the taking parent is a flight ri sk, ask the client if 
emergency relief should be sought to take the child from the ta king parent; gather 
substantiating informati on of flight risk ( i.e., emails with taking parent or relatives 
indicating plans to move, log of phone calls, or text messages threatening the 
same). 
(7) Ask the client if he or she can travel  to the United States for court hearings. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 98 
 (8) Ask the client if he or she have or can obtain a passport/visa for travel to the 
United States. 
(9) Give the client a comprehe nsive list of all contacts at  the firm and, if possible, 
include anyone who speak s the native language of the left-behind parent. 
(10) Obtain all available contact information for the client, including relatives’ contact 
information. 
5. Filing The Petition/Communicating With The Court. 
If the petition will be filed in a jurisdiction with a single judge, it is helpful to contact 
chambers before filing to discus s the logistics.  In a jurisdic tion with more than one judge, 
contact chambers after the judge is assigned.  Advise the law cl erk about the nature of Hague 
Convention cases and the referral from the State Department, if appl icable.  Offer collaboration, 
as these are unusual cases.  Consider e-mailing draf ts of pleadings to a receptive clerk.  Inform 
the court of judges in the same or nearby jurisdictions who previously have presided over Hague 
Convention cases.  Consider filing al l papers under seal to  protect the safety of  the child until the 
case is resolved. 
Discuss the need for an official translator , if necessary.  Inqui re about the Court’s 
preference for a particular transl ator or determine if there is an approved list of translators from 
which a translator must be selected.  Try to coor dinate the preliminary hearing with the client’s 
anticipated arrival into the jurisdiction.  If the c lient has low income, advise  the court of this and 
request a very short turnaround for the second hear ing to conserve resour ces.  Address the need 
for a hearing by phone or video conference if the cl ient is not able to travel to the initial 
hearing.428   This is not ideal, but it should be sought as a last resort. 
                                                 
428 It may be possible for a client to access a video conferencing system via a United States embassy or a 
local law firm that is willing to provide its video conferencing system pro bono . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 99 
 The State Department will send a letter to the judge (with a copy to all counsel) that 
explains the State Department’s role as U.S.  Central Authority for the Hague Convention and 
refers to key provisions of the Hague Petition an d documents regarding the history of the Hague 
Convention ( i.e., the Perez-Vera Report).  The judge’s lett er also clarifies that  the letter should 
not be construed by the court as constituting an opi nion of the United States or the Department of 
State regarding the merits of the case. 
Judges who have not presided over Hague C onvention cases previous ly also have other 
resources available.  The State Department will pr ovide the names of other judges in the same or 
nearby jurisdictions who have presided over Ha gue Convention cases and who would be willing 
to provide basic information to judges regard ing the Hague Convention process.  Additionally, 
the International Hague Network of Judges fac ilitates collaboration between judges in Hague 
signatory countries.  Judges from the United Stat es who are members of the International Hague 
Network of Judges are called U.S. Network Judges,  and may be able to offer advice to judges 
presiding over Hague Convention Cases.  The Stat e Department has contact information for U.S. 
Network Judges.  Additionally, the State Department’s judge’s letter  referenced in the preceding 
paragraph will contain information regarding the International Hague Network of Judges.  
6. Perfecting Service On The Abducting Parent. 
The critical decision in this pr ocess is whether the court will be asked to take custody of 
the child when the abducting parent is served (or before).  Expect that a judge will be uncomfortable with ordering law enforcement to ta ke custody of the child, and that counsel will 
need to make a compelling case to persuade a j udge to do so.  It is important to assess the 
likelihood that the abducting parent will flee the jurisdiction prior to the second hearing.  The left-behind parent’s testimony about  the abducting parent’s  lack of ties to th e jurisdiction, history 
of flight, or avoidance of prosecution will be pi votal, along with any information that the State NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 100 
 Department has gathered in its search for th e abducting parent and th e child.  The abducting 
parent’s illegal immigration status may lend s upport to the argument that the child’s presence 
should be secured by the court.  Counsel should fashion the requ est in a manner that will be 
familiar to the court, such as having a United States Marshal seize the child and bring the child 
before the judge. 
If clients (or family members) will be present in the jurisdiction to testify at the 
preliminary hearing and can take custody of the child pending the second hearing, and the child 
will feel safe with those persons, it may be compel ling to ask the court for the seizure of the child 
prior to the initial hearing.  Cons equently, after the initi al hearing, the client or family members 
immediately can take custody of the child until the second hearing on the mer its of the petition.  
If this is not possible, taki ng possession of the child and placing him or her in the custody of 
social services is also an alternative, albeit not preferable, when there is no one to take custody of 
the child, the child is in danger, and/or there is a flight risk. 
If the court is persuaded to order recovery  of the child, collaboration with the United 
States Marshals Service and/or  law enforcement is essential.   There should be an order 
specifically directing the United States Marshals or other appropriate law enforcement agency to 
pick up the child.  Suggest that the Marshals be present in court or chambers to discuss this 
procedure.  Address any fees that will be charged for this service.  If th e child attends school or 
daycare, the order should specify where and how the Marshals should pick up the child.  This 
should occur before service upon th e abducting parent to avoid a c onfrontation or flight.  Local 
law enforcement can bridge the gap betw een school officials and the court. 
In order to minimize trauma to the child, s uggest that a Marshal who is specifically-
trained to deal with children participate in the service.  Involve local law enforcement NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 101 
 departments, many of whom have a section, squa d or individual officer who deals with matters 
involving children.  Have the clie nt nearby to minimize the time be tween the pick up of the child 
and placement with the designated adults who will care for him or  her pending the court’s further 
order.  Bring toys or appropriate  distractions for the child.  Have  warm clothes or a blanket for 
the child if the weather is cold. 
After the child is taken into custody, the Marshals generally are instructed to bring the 
child and the client back to the courthouse for an appearance before a federal judge.  Suggesting 
this procedure in advance may reassure the court that it will have an opportunity to assess the 
child’s comfort with the client.  The client should be prepared to surrender to the court all travel 
documents for himself or herself and the child pending the outcome of the case. 
7. Travel And Accommodations. 
Counsel should expect to assist  the client in arranging trav el to the United States for 
hearings.  Accommodations must be sought on a cas e-by-case basis.  Cons olidators often provide 
airfares on major airlines at vas tly-reduced prices.  Seek donations  of frequent flyer miles from 
colleagues, which have the added advantage of flexibility.  Unless frequent flyer miles are used, 
anticipate a higher-than-usual ti cket price due to the last-mi nute booking, the one-way fare for 
the child’s return, and the need for a flexible re turn schedule, as well as Consulate fees for 
passports, visas, and other travel requirements depending on the country of  which the client and 
child are nationals.  In pro bono  cases, law firms frequently bear th e cost of the client’s travel. 
If the client does not have relatives in the vi cinity of the court’s jurisdiction, he or she 
will rely upon counsel to recommend or  make hotel arrangements (and in pro bono  cases, to pay 
the expense).  When making reservations, direct  contact with the hotel rather than using a 
national reservations system may result in greate r discount flexibility.  Hotels used by firms for 
housing recruits often will provide a greatly redu ced rate under the circumstances.  In some NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 102 
 cities, social service or  religious agencies might assist th e client in loca ting or paying for 
inexpensive housing. 
The hotel management should be advised of th e client’s situation to ensure a friendly 
reception.  It also is advisable to remind the client of security issues, such as not disclosing information to anyone unless strictly necessary, to prevent the taking parent from finding the 
client’s location.  Choose a hotel that offers a free breakfast and accommodations such as a 
microwave or small refrigerator if possible.  Collect donations of snacks from colleagues.  
Ideally, the hotel should be near  a grocery store and public tran sportation.  Sele ct a location 
appropriate for children, with proximity to a pa rk or mall and affordable (and if possible, 
appropriately ethnic) food. 
Discuss with the client the necessary travel  documents for him or her and the child.  
Check that no documents will expire during the expected stay in the United States.  Recommend that the client gather telephone numbers for fa mily members, employer, and co-workers back 
home in case of emergencies and contact informa tion for relatives in the United States in the 
event that the child has been moved.  Remind the c lient to refill all prescriptions and to bring an 
adequate supply for longer than is expected.  Th e client should bring a credit card (if possible) 
and cash (to be changed into United States currency before arrival). 
Advise the client about expected weather a nd appropriate clothing for court and out-of-
court time for them and the child.  Suggest that th e client bring toys, pict ures, and other favorite 
items that will make the child feel safe and fam iliar.  It will be helpful for the child to have 
objects that evoke good memories and happy moment s, given the change of circumstances and 
situation he or she will be faci ng.  Photos of other family memb ers and friends will be reassuring NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 103 
 to the child and evidence of family and the hom e environment.  A collapsible suitcase or duffel 
should be brought to transport the child’s items upon return. 
Counsel should consider purchasing a disposab le cell phone for the cl ient’s use while in 
the United States.  This ensures that counsel can reach their client at all times, particularly 
because service on the abducting parent and court dates are fluid in thes e cases.  The client 
should have an international ca lling card for communication with family and employers at home. 
Provide the client with a comprehensive list of contacts at counsel’ s law firm, along with 
phone numbers.  Identify, if possible, a liaison to coordinate miscellaneous logistics – preferably 
someone who speaks the client’s language.  Advise  the client who will pick up him or her at the 
airport and, if possible, send a pict ure of that person in advance.  Plan to provide transportation 
to and from court. 
8. Pending The Second Hearing. 
If the child is not recovered when the abduc ting parent is served with the petition, 
consider trying to arrange visitation for the client  and child in a public place prior to the second 
hearing.  While not ideal, the courthouse might serve as a central location.  Other potential 
locations would include a park or a fast-food restau rant.  This will reassure the client and will 
give the child an opportunity to re-familiarize them selves with the left-behind parent.  The value 
of this cannot be underestimated.  Children ofte n are told untrue storie s about the left-behind 
parent, sometimes rising to the level of brainw ashing and alienation, cau sing children to fear 
returning with those parents.  Depending on the ag e of the child at abdu ction, the child may not 
have clear memories of the other parent or speak the left-behind parent’s language.  If the child is 
an appropriate age, the court may hear their wishes regarding retu rn to his or her home country, 
and the opportunity to reconnect with the left-beh ind parent will assist in a positive resolution.  NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 104 
 NCMEC or the State Department also can arrang e referrals for reunification specialists who can 
assist in reuniting the left-b ehind parent and the child. 
During this time, it is importa nt that the client understand  the timetable and what to 
expect from the process.  This is particularly difficult when the client has no family or friends 
nearby while the case is pending in court.  To the ex tent that there are cult ural, religious, or other 
communities in which the client might feel co mfortable, consider making the appropriate 
introduction. 
9. Court Order. 
Counsel should provide the court with an or der for return immediately or as soon as 
possible after the hearing.  The order should provide  specific information for the child to travel 
internationally with his or her pa rent – this will be sufficient in most circumstances.  NCMEC or 
the State Department can provide sample orders that  counsel can review.  It may be helpful to get 
an apostille (an international recognition) from the court in English and the client’s foreign 
language.  Regardless of whether th e jurisdiction considers the return  of the child to the foreign 
country to moot a subsequent appeal, it always ma kes sense to move quickly to get the client and 
the child out of the United Stat es.  Be aware that several abdu cting parents have absconded with 
the children a second time after the court issued a return order.  Take precautions to secure the 
child leading up to his or her return to the home country. 
10. Mediation. 
Mediation is another option to resolve the dispute between the abducting and left-behind 
parents.  An objective mediation, even after an  international abductio n, can lead to a quick 
resolution that benefits both  the parents and the child.  An effective mediation is: 
(1) Expedient; (2) Inexpensive; NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 105 
 (3) Less invasive for the child and the parents; and 
(4) Effective because the results are tail ored to the situation and circumstances 
affecting the child. 
Disadvantages of a mediation occur when a mediat ion is used as a tactic to delay or prevent 
parents’ access to the United Stat es courts or when parents fail to receive a court order binding 
the parties to the mediation. 
Upon a request of the parties or  based on the jurisdiction’s local  rules, a court could order 
the parties to participate in a mediation.  This option ensures that, if the mediation is successful, 
the court will issue an order binding  the parties to the resolution.  If  the court asks the parties to 
provide a list of suggested medi ators, NCMEC or the State Depart ment are resources to provide 
information concerning attorneys or judges who are familiar with Hague Convention cases.  If 
clients decide to participate in a mediation, be  sure to set or request a time limit for the 
discussions to avoid any delay tactics by the abduc ting parent.  If the mediation is not successful, 
the client needs to rely on the judicial process. 
In light of the potential advantages, it is not surprising that research and interest in 
international child abduction medi ation has been expanding in rece nt years.  Although the U.S. 
does not yet have a nationwide mediation mech anism in place, a number of academics and 
practitioners have explored th e topic of mediating Hague Conve ntion cases.  The U.S. State 
Department also has explored  mediation at length and, among other helpful guidance, 
recommends that parties seeking a long-term solu tion take special efforts to create an agreement 
that is enforceable in ea ch country of residence. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 106 
 V. THE UNIFORM CHILD CUSTODY J URISDICTION AND ENFORCEMENT 
ACT. 
Although the Hague Convention provides a we ll-established civil legal process for 
international child abduction cas es, practitioners also should be  aware of the Uniform Child 
Custody Jurisdiction and Enfo rcement Act (“UCCJEA”),429 which can supplement the Hague 
Convention and provide alternativ e options for responding to family abductions into the United 
States.  Drafted in 1997430 to address the practical inconsis tencies of its predecessor statute,431 
the UCCJEA432 also reconciled the ov erlapping federal PKPA433 and provided a substantial 
enforcement mechanism for intersta te custody decrees.  Most importa ntly for the purposes of this 
guide, the UCCJEA expressly applies to internat ional cases by mandating that a foreign country 
shall be treated as if it were a state of the Unite d States for all general and jurisdictional purposes 
(UCCJEA Articles 1 and 2).434  For enforcement purposes (UCCJ EA Article 3), a foreign child 
custody order that substantially conforms to th e UCCJEA’s jurisdictiona l standards shall be 
recognized and enforced in the same manner as if issued by a U.S. state.435  Finally, the UCCJEA 
                                                 
429 UNIF. CHILD CUSTODY JURISDICTION & ENFORCEMENT ACT (1997), 9(1A) U.L.A. 657 (1999). 
430 The UCCJEA has been enacted by all states, wi th the exception of Massachusetts where adopting 
legislation is pending, and also has been enacted in Guam, USVI, and DC.  Adopting legislation is 
pending in Puerto Rico. 
431 For a discussion of the UCCJEA’s relationship to prior statutes see Patricia M. Hoff, The ABC’s of the 
UCCJEA: Interstate Child Custody Practice Under the New Act , 32 Fam. L. Q. 267 (1998). 
432 For the specific location and citation of the UCCJ EA as adopted by each state, refer to the legal 
appendix in NCMEC’s Guidebook, Patricia M. Hoff, F AMILY ABDUCTION : PREVENTION AND RESPONSE  
(6th ed. 2009), http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC75.pdf . 
433  28 U.S.C. § 1738A . 
434 UCCJEA § 105(a). 
435 Id. at § 105(b). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 107 
 contains an “escape clause” that allows a court to  refuse to apply the Act if the child custody law 
of the foreign country in question “violate s fundamental principles of human rights.”436 
The UCCJEA’s international component makes it applicable to several common factual 
scenarios faced by attorneys in Hague Convention cases, including: 
1) The UCCJEA as an alternative mechan ism when the Hague Convention may not 
fully apply. 
2) The UCCJEA as a strategic alternativ e mechanism, even when the Hague 
Convention does apply. 
3) The UCCJEA as a supplement to the Hague Convention’s remedies, especially for 
pick-up remedies. 
A. WHEN THE HAGUE CONVENTION DOES NOT APPLY . 
The preceding sections described many of the limits of the Hague Convention but, in 
some situations, the UCCJEA’s provisions may a llow a left-behind parent to seek relief beyond 
these limits.  For example, a left-behind pare nt may have a custody de cree that was issued after  
the child was taken (a “chasing order”), which grants  them substantial custody rights. As 
discussed previously, the rights of custody pr otected by the Hague Convention do not include 
those obtained after the abduction took place. Th e parent still may have a remedy under the 
Convention based upon his or her operation of law custody rights,  but the UCCJEA provides an 
alternative method to enforce the complete ra nge of a left-behind parent’s custody rights. 
Article 3 of the UCCJEA lays out the proce ss for registering and seeking enforcement of 
a foreign child custody order.  To register an out-of-state custody determ ination, a party simply 
                                                 
436 Id. at § 105(c).  For a lengthy discussion and comment on the merits of this provision see Marianne D. 
Blair, International Application of the U CCJEA: Scrutinizing the Escape Clause , 38 Fam. L.Q. 547 
(2004). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 108 
 files a request for registration with a court in the receiving state along with certified copies of the 
foreign child custody determination and other verifi ed information. Typically, the court then files 
the order as a foreign judgment and serves notice on any parent or person who is awarded 
custody or visitation in the order, or otherwise entitled to notice.  Any parent who opposes the 
registration then has twenty days to request a hearing to contest th e order.  If the parent does not 
timely request a hearing, then the order is confirmed as a matter of  law, and the registered order 
may be enforced by any means available to enforce a domestic order. 
If the registration is contested, on ly three defenses are available: 
1. The issuing court l acked jurisdiction; 
2. The underlying custody order ha s been vacated, stayed or 
 modified; and 
3. Lack of notice.437 
For appropriate circumstances, the UCCJEA also provides an e xpedited enforcement 
process.438  In addition, if the child is in immine nt danger of serious physical harm or is 
imminently likely to be removed from the ju risdiction, the UCCJEA provides a mechanism for 
petitioning parents to apply for a warrant authorizing law enfor cement to take physical custody 
of the child simultaneously or prior to service upon the taking parent.439 
B. STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVE TO THE HAGUE CONVENTION . 
There may be situations where parents fully entitled to relief unde r the Hague Convention 
choose instead to pursue action in state court under the UCCJEA.  For example, the UCCJEA 
provides a vehicle for enforcement of a pre-existi ng custody order held by a left-behind parent if 
that custody order resulted from an agreement between the parties or a judicial proceeding in 
                                                 
437 UCCJEA § 305. 
438 Id. at § 308. 
439 Id. at § 311. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 109 
 which all parties were served and had an opport unity to be heard.  A standard or expedited 
UCCJEA proceeding also may provide a more sp eedy resolution than a Hague Convention return 
case in federal court.  Additiona lly, the affirmative defenses avai lable to abducting parents in 
Hague Convention return cases are not availa ble under the UCCJEA.  With one exception, only 
challenges regarding the providence of the fore ign custody order may be raised by the taking 
parent during the UCCJEA registration process; ch allenges regarding the substance of the order 
itself or other factual is sues may not be raised.440  As noted above, howev er, a court can decline 
to recognize or grant enforcemen t assistance to a foreign order th at was issued in a jurisdiction 
whose child custody laws violate “funda mental principles of human rights.”441 
C. SUPPLEMENT TO THE HAGUE CONVENTION . 
In addition to providing alternative remedies  to the Hague Convention, the UCCJEA also 
was designed to complement the Hague Conventi on by allowing state courts to assist with 
enforcement of a Hague return order as if it were  a child custody order subject to the UCCJEA’s 
usual enforcement provisions. 442  The UCCJEA, as drafted a nd adopted in some states,443 gives 
prosecutors the power to enforce custody or visitation orders and gives law enforcement officers 
the power to locate children and follow instructions from prosecutors.444  Section 315 of the 
UCCJEA grants prosecutors statutory authority to  take action to locate children or see that 
children are returned or enforce a child custody determination.  A prosecutor may act if one of 
the following exists: 
                                                 
440 Id. at § 105(c). 
441 Id. at § 105(b). 
442 Id. at § 302. 
443 Not every state has adopted the “Prosecutor or P ublic Official” portion of the UCCJEA.  For a listing 
and statutory citation for any states that have adopt ed this section, refer to the legal appendix in 
NCMEC’s Guidebook, supra  note 433. 
444 UCCJEA §  315. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 110 
 1. A prior custody determination has been made; 
2. A request for such action from a court in a pending child 
custody proceeding has been made; 
3. A reasonable belief exists that a criminal statute has been 
violated; or 
4. A reasonable belief exists that the children have been 
wrongfully removed or retained  in violation of the Hague 
Convention.445 
The UCCJEA gives a prosecutor the power to  act in cases aris ing under either the 
UCCJEA or the Hague Convention.446  At the request of a pros ecutor acting under this section, 
the UCCJEA enables law enforcement to take “any lawful action reasonably necessary” to locate 
a child, locate a parent, or assist the prosecutor in fu lfilling their responsibilities.447 
When Hague Convention proceedings end—becau se the treaty no longer applies to a 
child who has reached 16 years old or an order denying the return is issued, for instance—one or 
both parents may wish to seek a custody determinati on from a U.S. court.  In this situation, the 
UCCJEA will pick up where the treaty ends and control the content and jurisdictional elements 
of the child custody case in state court.  Finally, as discussed in the following Section VI , the 
UCCJEA takes center-stage when a request for access is made under the Hague Convention.  A 
petition for access may be filed independently or after a Hague return petition has been denied.

 VI. RIGHTS OF ACCESS 
In wrongful removal cases, the question of parental rights of access—as opposed to 
custody and return—is an area ripe with c onfusion for parents and their legal counsel.448  This 
confusion stems from the scope of the Hague  Convention itself and the federal courts’ 
interpretation of it.  Article 21  of the Convention and the International Child Abduction 
Remedies Act (ICARA) seem to provide for certai n rights of access, but the weight of authority 
from the federal courts is that Article 21  and ICARA offer no tangible remedy.  As a result, the 
federal courts are left with very lit tle power to address and remedy access cases.449  Accordingly, 
access issues are best resolved by the state courts  that traditionally deal with this relatively 
specialized area of the law.  Counsel for parents seeking only  access rights should proceed in the 
state courts to avoid a potential dismissal of the action by a federal court.  State courts also are 
most familiar with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”), 
which is a powerful option to use in access cases.450 
One of the most instructive decisions addressi ng “rights of access” in the context of the 
Hague Convention is Bromley v. Bromley .451  A primary issue addressed in Bromley  was whether 
the court possessed the authority to enforce ri ghts of access under the Convention.  Petitioner 
argued that both his access and vi sitation rights were governed by Article 21  of the Convention.  
The court declined to address the right of access issue, holding that the rights of the petitioner 
                                                 
448 The Hague Convention provides that “rights of access” “include the right to take a child for a limited 
period of time to a place other than the child’s habitual residence.”  Hague Convention, supra  note 2, art. 
5(b). 
449 Jenkins v. Jenkins , 569 F.3d 549, 555 (6th Cir. 2009) (holding that “[u]nder the Convention, the 
remedy of return is available for a wrongful remova l or retention but not for a breach of the right to 
access.”). 
450 See, e.g. , Paillier v. Pence , 50 Cal. Rptr. 3d 459, 461 (Cal. Ct. A pp. 2006) (holding that California trial 
court lacked jurisdiction under the UCCJEA to en force or modify child French visitation order). 
451 30 F. Supp. 2d 857 (E.D. Pa. 1998). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 112 
 “may not be addressed by this court because there is no remedy  under the Convention for 
obstacles to rights of access absent  a ‘wrongful’ removal of a child.”452The court reasoned that 
because Article 21  is limited to filing an application w ith the Central Authorities for access 
rights, it “does not provide the courts with independent author ity to remedy such a situation.”453 
In Bromley , the court drew a clear distinction between Article 21  access rights and the 
Convention’s Article 21  return language.  Acco rding to the court, the “silence of the Convention 
as to any remedy for access rights is in sharp contrast to Article 21  which clearly provides 
authority for judicial authorities to order the return of a chil d ‘wrongfully’ removed.”454In 
support, the Bromley  court cited the State Department’s lega l analysis of the Convention (Public 
Notice 957) addressing remedies for breach of ac cess rights.  The State Department found that: 
“Access rights,” which are synonym ous with “visitation rights,” 
are also protected by the Convention, but to a lesser extent than custody rights.  While the Convent ion preamble and Article 1(b) 
articulate the Convention objective of ensuring that rights of access 
under the law of one state are respec ted in other Contracting States, 
the remedies for breach of acces s rights are those enunciated in 
Article 21 and do not include th e return remedy provided by 
Article 12.
455 
As the Bromley  court noted, state and foreign courts  have reached similar results.  For 
example, in Viragh v. Foldes ,456 the Massachusetts Supreme Judi cial Court held that “the 
Convention does not mandate any specific reme dy when a parent without physical possession 
has established interferen ce with rights of access.”457  Without a breach of custody rights, the

 Convention cannot be invoked because rem oval cannot be considered “wrongful.”458  Similarly, 
in the United Kingdom, Article 21  has been described as toothless because it fails to confer 
jurisdiction on the British courts to determine matters relating to access.459 
After the Bromley  decision and its progeny, advocates turned to the plain language of 
ICARA, thinking that it would pe rmit a federal cause of action ove r access cases.  That hope was 
dashed by the Fourth Circuit in Cantor v. Cohen .460  In holding that ICARA did not confer 
jurisdiction upon federal courts to hear access cases, the Fourth Ci rcuit began its analysis with 
the implementing language of section 11601, in which Congress declared that: 
[t]he Convention and this chapte r empower courts in the United 
States to determine only rights under the Convention and not the 
merits of any underlying child custody claims. 
42 U.S.C. § 11601(b)(4)  (emphasis added).461 
In turning to the Convention, the Cantor  court noted that Article 21  of the Convention 
permitted an application seeking access to be made to the Central Authority of a country, which in the case of the United States, was the State Department and not a court.  The court further 
turned to the languag e of section 11603(b), which provi ded that a part y seeking relief under the 
Convention  for access may commence a proceeding in a court which has jurisdiction over that 
matter and concluded that, under the Convention, a federal court has no such jurisdiction.  Thus, 
in directing applicants for access to the appropri ate state court, the Fourth Circuit makes clear 
                                                
 
458 Id.; see also Wiezel v. Wiezel-Tyrnauer , 388 F. Supp. 2d 206, 211 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (ruling that even 
where a petitioner appropriately seeks to enforce its cu stodial rights, the federal courts will not have 
jurisdiction under the Convention if the ultimate  relief sought is an order of visitation, i.e., a right of 
access). 
459 See Re G (A Minor) (Enforcement of Access Abroad) , [1993] All E.R. 657 (stating that “[t]here are no 
teeth to be found in article 21 and its  provisions have no part to play in the decision to be made by the 
judge”). 
460 442 F.3d 196 (4th Cir. 2006). 
461 Id. at 199. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 114 
 that it considers issues of access to be include d in the umbrella of “underlying child custody 
claims” and distinguishable from return cases , which may not address these custody claims.462 
In Viragh v. Foldes ,463 the court interpreted Article 21  as instructing the court “to 
‘promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and the fulfillment of any conditions to which 
the exercise of those rights may be subject,’ as well as to ‘take steps to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to th e exercise of such rights.’”
464  The Foldes  court recognized that: 
A major purpose of the Convention is to protect the access righ ts of the parent 
without physical possession when the childr en reside in  a contracting nation other 
than where the parent without physical  possession resides.  The Convention 
provides that the parent who has rem oved the children from their habitual 
residence, and made the exercise of access rights more difficult, may be ordered to 
pay the necessary expenses incurred by the parent without physical possession 
effectively to exercise rights of access.”465 
The court went on to craft a visi tation schedule in the United States  to facilitate the petitioner’s 
exercise of his access rights, gi ven the financial burdens associ ated with travel between the 
United States and Hungary.466 
In Abbott v. Abbott ,467 the United States Supreme Court held that the ne exeat  right is a 
custodial right, and therefore, the remedy of return  of the child to his or her country of habitual 
residence is available to  the left-behind parent.468 In its analysis, the Supreme Court 
distinguished between the remedies  available to a parent with a ne exeat  right and those available

 to a parent who merely had rights of access or visitation.469  In doing so, Abbott v. Abbott  
reaffirmed that the United States courts have no authority under th e Convention to order 
abducted children returned to their left-behind count ry when a taking parent  has violated a right 
of access. 
An application for access rights is fundamentally different from an application for return 
because it requires the petitioner to  acknowledge that the child will remain in the United States 
and hence be subject to the jurisdiction of a United States court.  A court therefore is permitted to consider the best interests of the child when cr afting an appropriate visitation schedule, and as a 
practical matter, a United States court has contin uing jurisdiction to make any modifications to 
that visitation agreement at a later date. 
VII. PRACTITIONERS’ CONCLUDING THOUGHTS: WHAT ABOUT THE 
IMPACT ON THE CHILD? 
This Manual was designed to provide a road map for the representation of left-behind 
parents whose children were brought to or retain ed in the United States wrongfully by the other 
parent.  The job of counsel for the left-behind pare nt (in most cases) is to achieve the safe return 
of the child to the client’s c ountry, and we have recommended c ourses of action to  achieve that 
goal first and foremost.  As a matter of law, the child’s best interests are not at issue. 
Yet, while forbidding an analysis of the child ’s best interests, the Hague Convention does 
look to the impact of the abduction and related le gal proceedings on the child.  The well-settled 
defense recognizes the potential harm in uprooti ng a child who has made this country home in a 
significant way, balancing that ag ainst the interests of the pare nt who did not choose to be 
separated from his or her child.  The mature ch ild objection provides a voice to some children.  
The grave risk defense protects a child who would be subjected to intolerable abusive 
                                                
 
469 Id. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 116 
 circumstances upon return, but the practitioners’ e xperience shows that this defense can be 
narrowly interpreted by courts to return a ch ild even when the abducting parent has been 
subjected to domestic violence in the presence of the child.  Couns el for the left-behind parent 
are responsible for advocating to defeat these defenses. 
Practitioners have recognized th at in their advocacy and avoidance of a “best interests” 
analysis, they sometimes lost focus on the impact  of the proceeding on the child.  A child, caught 
in the middle of the parents’ dispute, cannot help  being affected by the adversarial nature of the 
conflict.  The child’s state of mind and perception of the respective roles of the parents in his or 
her life may have been influenced, intentionally or otherwise, by the abducting parent.  This is 
especially true when the child ha s been separated from the left-b ehind parent for many months or 
years.  It is very difficult to judge what effect  this estrangement may ha ve on an impressionable 
child, who may believe that the left-behind parent  has abandoned or does not love him or her. 
When law enforcement picks up a child at school, it ensures that  the child does not 
disappear from the jurisdiction, but this could cause some anxiety fo r the child.  A child is often 
kept out of the courtroom to avoi d exposure to the parents’ dispute,  but the seclusio n also can be 
stressful.  It often is  recommended to rush clie nts and children to the ai rport and thro ugh security 
once a return order is entered because lingering pres ents a danger that an appeal will be filed and 
a stay will be entered.  Yet in doing so, as ofte n occurs with the initia l abduction, the child may 
not have a chance to say goodbye to the other parent  or friends or collect cherished possessions. 
It can be difficult for counsel to balance th eir responsibility to ar gue for the safe and 
efficient return of the child while trying to mi nimize the negative impact on the child.  There are 
no easy answers, but there are op tions.  Mediation, addressed in Section IV.C.10  of this Manual, 
is increasingly available, and an agreed-u pon resolution may be preferable in some NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL    Page 117 
 circumstances.470  Counsel can advise their clients about the impact their past and future actions 
have on their children and suggest ways to ease  the transition.  Counse l can ask the court to 
permit the children to say goodbye to the other pa rent in a private, supervised location.  
Counseling for the children and clients can be facilitated.471  Practitioners can offer to send the 
children’s belongings to them after their return  if the taking parent will allow it.  Also, 
practitioners can suggest that clients strive to keep lines of communication open between the 
other parent and the children af ter the return.  By offering this  guidance and discussing the pros 
and cons of any course of acti on, counsel empower their clients to  make informed decisions for 
themselves and their children.

b) to ensure that ri ghts of custody and of ac cess under the law of one Contracting State are 
effectively respected in the other Contracting States. 
Article 2  
Contracting States shall take all appropriate m easures to secure within their territories the 
implementation of the objects of the Conventi on. For this purpose they  shall use the most 
expeditious procedures available. 
Article 3  
The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where - 
a) it is in breach of rights of  custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, 
either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident 
immediately before the removal or retention; 
and b) at the time of removal or re tention those rights were actually ex ercised, either jointly or alone, 
or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention. 
The rights of custody mentioned in  sub-paragraph a) above, may arise in particular by operation 
of law or by reason of a judici al or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having 
legal effect under the law of that State. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page B-2  
 
 Article 4  
The Convention shall apply to an y child who was habitually resi dent in a Contracting State 
immediately before any breach of custody or access rights. 
The Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years. 
Article 5  
For the purposes of this Convention - 
a) ‘rights of custody’ sh all include rights relating to the care  of the person of the child and, in 
particular, the right to determine the child’s place of residence; 
b) ‘rights of access’ shall include the right to ta ke a child for a limited period of time to a place 
other than the child’s habitual residence. 
CHAPTER II - CENTRAL AUTHORITIES  
Article 6  
A Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are 
imposed by the Convention upon such authorities. 
Federal States, States with more than one system  of law or States having autonomous territorial 
organizations shall be free to appoint more than one Central Authority and to specify the territorial extent of their power s. Where a State has appointed mo re than one Central Authority, 
it shall designate the Central Authority to which applications may be addressed for transmission 
to the appropriate Central Authority within that State. 
Article 7  
Central Authorities shall co- operate with each other and pr omote co-operation amongst the 
competent authorities in their respective States to  secure the prompt return of children and to 
achieve the other object s of this Convention. 
In particular, either directly or  through any intermediary, they sh all take all appropriate measures 
- 
a) to discover the whereabouts of a child w ho has been wrongfully removed or retained; 
b) to prevent further harm to the child or prejudice  to interested parties by  taking or causing to be 
taken provisional measures; 
c) to secure the volunta ry return of the child or to bring about an amicable resolution of the 
issues; 
d) to exchange, where desirable, information re lating to the social background of the child; 
e) to provide information of a general character as  to the law of their Stat e in connection with the 
application of the Convention; NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page B-3  
 
 f) to initiate or facilitate the institution of judi cial or administrative proceedings with a view to 
obtaining the return of the child and, in a proper case, to make  arrangements for organizing or 
securing the effective exerci se of rights of access; 
g) where the circumstances so require, to prov ide or facilitate the pr ovision of legal aid and 
advice, including the participati on of legal counsel and advisers; 
h) to provide such administrative arrangements as may be necessary and appropriate to secure 
the safe return of the child; 
i) to keep each other informed with respect to the operation of this Convention and, as far as 
possible, to eliminate any obs tacles to its application. 
CHAPTER III - RETURN OF CHILDREN  
Article 8  
Any person, institution or other bo dy claiming that a child has b een removed or retained in 
breach of custody rights may apply either to th e Central Authority of the child’s habitual 
residence or to the Central Aut hority of any other Contracting St ate for assistance in securing the 
return of the child. 
The application shall contain - 
a) information concerning the identity of the app licant, of the child and of the person alleged to 
have removed or retained the child; 
b) where available, the da te of birth of the child; 
c) the grounds on which the applicant’s cl aim for return of the child is based; 
d) all available information relating to the wherea bouts of the child and the identity of the person 
with whom the child is presumed to be. 
The application may be accompanied or supplemented by - 
e) an authenticated copy of any relevant decision or agreement; 
f) a certificate or an affidavit emanating from a Central Authority, or other competent authority 
of the State of the child’s habitual residence, or from a qualified person, concerning the relevant 
law of that State; 
g) any other relevant document. 
Article 9  
If the Central Authority which receives an application referred to in Article 8 has reason to 
believe that the child is in anot her Contracting State, it shall directly and without delay transmit 
the application to the Central Authority of th at Contracting State and inform the requesting 
Central Authority, or the appl icant, as the case may be. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page B-4  
 
 Article 10  
The Central Authority of the State where the ch ild is shall take or cause to be taken all 
appropriate measures in order to obta in the voluntary return of the child. 
Article 11  
The judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting Stat es shall act expeditiously in 
proceedings for the return of children. 
If the judicial or administrative authority con cerned has not reached a decision within six weeks 
from the date of commencement of the proceedings , the applicant or the Central Authority of the 
requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, 
shall have the right to request a statement of th e reasons for the delay.  If a reply is received by 
the Central Authority of the requested State, that  Authority shall transmit the reply to the Central 
Authority of the requesting State, or to the applicant, as the case may be. 
Article 12  
Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retain ed in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of 
the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administra tive authority of the 
Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of 
the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child 
forthwith. 
The judicial or administrative authority, even wh ere the proceedings have been commenced after 
the expiration of the period of one  year referred to in  the preceding paragr aph, shall also order 
the return of the child, unless it is demonstr ated that the child is now settled in its new 
environment. 
Where the judicial or ad ministrative authority in the requested State has reason to believe that 
the child has been taken to another State, it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application 
for the return of the child. 
Article 13  
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Ar ticle, the judicial or administrative authority 
of the requested State is not bound to order the re turn of the child if the person, institution or 
other body which opposes its re turn establishes that - 
a) the person, institution or other body having th e care of the person of the child was not actually 
exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or 
subsequently acquiesced in th e removal or retention; or 
b) there is a grave risk that hi s or her return would expose the ch ild to physical or psychological 
harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. 
The judicial or administra tive authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds 
that the child objects to being re turned and has attained an age a nd degree of maturity at which it 
is appropriate to take  account of its views. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page B-5  
 
 In considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, the judicial and administrative 
authorities shall take into account  the information rela ting to the social b ackground of the child 
provided by the Central Authority or  other competent authority of th e child’s habitual residence. 
Article 14  
In ascertaining whether there ha s been a wrongful removal or re tention within the meaning of 
Article 3, the judicial or administ rative authorities of the requested  State may take notice directly 
of the law of, and of judicial or administrative d ecisions, formally recognized or not in the State 
of the habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the speci fic procedures for the proof of 
that law or for the recognition of foreign de cisions which would otherwise be applicable. 
Article 15  
The judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State may, prior to the making of an 
order for the return of the child, request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the State 
of the habitual residence of th e child a decision or  other determination that the removal or 
retention was wrongful with in the meaning of Artic le 3 of the Convention, where such a decision 
or determination may be obtained in  that State. The Central Author ities of the Contracting States 
shall so far as practicable a ssist applicants to obtain such a decision or determination. 
Article 16  
After receiving notice of a wrongful removal or retention of a child in the sense of Article 3, the 
judicial or administrative auth orities of the Contracting Stat e to which the child has been 
removed or in which it has been retained shall not decide on th e merits of rights of custody until 
it has been determined that the child is not to be returned under this C onvention or unless an 
application under this Convention is not lodged w ithin a reasonable time following receipt of the 
notice. 
Article 17  
The sole fact that a decision rela ting to custody has been given in or is entitled to recognition in 
the requested State shall not be a ground for refu sing to return a child under this Convention, but 
the judicial or administrative authorities of th e requested State may take account of the reasons 
for that decision in applying this Convention. 
Article 18  
The provisions of this Chapter do not limit the power  of a judicial or admi nistrative authority to 
order the return of the child at any time. 
Article 19  
A decision under this Convention c oncerning the return of the child  shall not be taken to be 
determination on the merits  of any custody issue. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page B-6  
 
 Article 20  
The return of the child under the provisions of Article 12 may be refused if this would not be 
permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
CHAPTER VI - RIGHTS OF ACCESS  
Article 21  
An application to make arrangements for organi zing or securing the effective exercise of rights 
of access may be presented to the Central Authorit ies of the Contracting St ates in the same way 
as an application for the return of a child. 
The Central Authorities are bound by the obligati ons of co-operation which are set forth in 
Article 7 to promote the peaceful enjoymen t of access rights and th e fulfillment of any

Hague International Child Abduction C onvention; Text and Legal Analysis 
*10494  On October 30, 1985 President Reagan sent  the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil 
Aspects of International Child Abduction to th e U.S. Senate and recommended that the Senate 
give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and accord its advice and consent to 
U.S. ratification.  The text of th e Convention and the President’s Le tter of Transmittal, as well as 
the Secretary of State’s Letter of  Submittal to the President, were  published shortly thereafter in 
Senate Treaty Doc. 99-11.  On January 31, 1986 the Department of State sent to Senator Lugar, 
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Re lations to which the Convention was referred, 
a detailed Legal Analysis of the Convention designed to assist the Committee and the full Senate in their consideration of the Conve ntion.  It is believed that broad availability of the Letters of 
Transmittal and Submittal, the English text of th e Convention and the Legal Analysis will be of 
considerable help also to parents, the bench a nd the bar, as well as federal, State and local 
authorities, in understanding the Convention, and in resorting to or implementing it should the 
United States ultimately ratify it.  Thus, these documents are reproduced below for the 
information of the general public.

The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of In ternational Child Abduction consists of six 
chapters containing forty-five ar ticles.  While not formally inco rporated into the Convention, a NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-2

Private International Law and was recommended fo r use in making application for the return of 
wrongfully removed or retained children.  A copy of  that form is annexed to this Legal Analysis. 
(The form to be used for the return of child ren from the United States may seek additional 
information.)

Guide  to Terminology  Used  in the Legal  Analysis  
“Abduction” as used in the Convention title is not intended in a criminal sense.  That term is 
shorthand for the phrase “wrongful removal or retention” which appear s throughout the text, 
beginning with the preambular language and Artic le 1.  Generally speaking, “wrongful removal” 
refers to the taking of a child from the person who was actually exercisi ng custody of the child. 
“Wrongful retention” refers to the act of keepi ng the child without the consent of the person who 
was actually exercising custody.  The archetype of this conduct is the refu sal by the noncustodial 
parent to return a child at the end of an author ized visitation period. “Wr ongful retention” is not 
intended by this Convention to cover refusal by the custodial parent to  permit visitation by the 
other parent. Such obstruction of visitation ma y be redressed in accordance with Article 21. 
The term “abductor” as used in this analysis refers to the person alleged to have wrongfully 
removed or retained a child.  This person is al so referred to as the “alleged wrongdoer” or the 
“respondent.” 
The term “person” as used in this analysis incl udes the person, institut ion or other body who (or 
which) actually exercised custody prior to the abduction and is seeking the child’s return.  The “person” seeking the child’s return is also referred to as “applican t” and “petitioner.” 
The terms “court” and “judicial au thority” are used througho ut the analysis to mean both judicial 
and administrative bodies empowered to make d ecisions on petitions ma de pursuant to this 
Convention. “Judicial decree” a nd “court order” likewise include decisions made by courts or 
administrative bodies. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-5  
 
 “Country of origin” and “requesting country” refer to the child’s country  (“State”) of habitual 
residence prior to the wrongful re moval or retention. “Country addr essed” refers to the country 
(“State”) where the child is located or the country  to which the child is believed to have been 
taken.  It is in that country that a judicial or administrative proceeding for return would be 
brought. 
“Access rights” correspond to “visitation rights.” 
References to the “reporter” are to Elisa Per ez-Vera, the official Hague Conference reporter for 
the Convention.  Her explanatory report is recogni zed by the Conference as the official history 
and commentary on the Convention and is a source of background on the meaning of the 
provisions of the Convention availabl e to all States becoming parties to it.  It is referred to herein 
as the “Perez-Vera Report.” The Per ez-Vera Report appears in Actes et *10504  documents de la 
Quatorzieme Session (1980), Volume III, Child Abduction, edited by the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, The Hague, Netherlands. (The volume may 
be ordered from the Netherla nds Government Printing and P ublishing Office, 1 Christoffel 
Plantijnstraat, Post-box 20014, 2500 EA The Hague, Netherlands.) 
I. Children Protected by the Convention A fundamental purpose of th e Hague Convention is to pr otect children from wrongful 
international removals or retentions by persons  bent on obtaining their physical and/or legal 
custody.  Children who are wrongfully moved from c ountry to country are deprived of the stable 
relationships which the Convention is designed pr omptly to restore.  Contracting States are 
obliged by Article 2 to take a ll appropriate measures to im plement the objectives of the 
Convention as set forth in Article 1:  (1) To secure the prompt return  of children wrongfully 
removed to or retained in any C ontracting State;  and (2) to ensu re that rights of custody and of 
access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in other Contracting 
States.  While these objectives are universal in their appeal, the Convention does not cover all 
children who might be victims of wrongful takings or retentions.  A threshold inquiry, therefore, 
is whether the child who has been abducted or reta ined is subject to the Convention’s provisions.  
Only if the child falls within the scope of the Convention will the administrative and judicial 
mechanisms of the Convention apply. 
A. Age 
The Convention applies only to children under the ag e of sixteen (16).  Even if a child is under 
sixteen at the time of the wrongful removal or retention as well as wh en the Convention is 
invoked, the Convention ceases to apply when  the child reaches sixteen.  Article 4. 
Absent action by governments to e xpand coverage of the Conventi on to children aged sixteen 
and above pursuant to Article 36, the Convention itself is unavailable as the legal vehicle for 
securing return of a child sixteen  or older.  However, it does not bar return of such child by other 
means. 
Articles 18, 29 and 34 make clear  that the Convention is a none xclusive remedy in cases of 
international child abduction.  Article 18 provide s that the Convention does not limit the power 
of a judicial authority to orde r return of a child at any ti me, presumably under other laws, 
procedures or comity, irrespectiv e of the child’s age.  Article 29 permits the person who claims a 
breach of custody or access rights, as define d by Articles 3 and 21, to bypass the Convention 
completely by invoking any applicable laws or proce dures to secure the child ’s return.  Likewise, NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-6  
 
 Article 34 provides that the Convent ion shall not restrict the applic ation of any law in the State 
addressed for purposes of obtaining the child’s return or for organizing visitation rights. 
Assuming such laws are not restri cted to children under sixteen, a child sixteen or over may be 
returned pursuant to their provisions. 
Notwithstanding the general application of the C onvention to children unde r sixteen, it should be 
noted that the wishes of mature children re garding their return are not ignored by the 
Convention.  Article 13 permits, but does not require,  the judicial authority to refuse to order the 
child returned if the child “objects to being re turned and has attained an age and degree of 
maturity at which it is appropriate to take a ccount of its views.” Th e role of the child’s 
preference in return proceedings is di scussed further at III.I(2)(d), infra. 
B. Residence  
In order for the Convention to apply the child must have been “habitu ally resident in a 
Contracting State immediately before any breach  of custody or access righ ts.” Article 4.  In 
practical terms, the Convention may be invoked only where the child was habitually resident in a 
Contracting State and taken to or  retained in another Contrac ting State.  Accordingly, child 
abduction and retention cases are actionable under the Convention if  they are inte rnational in 
nature (as opposed to interstate), and provide d the Convention has entered into force for both 
countries involved. See discussi on of Article 38, VI.B, infra. 
To illustrate, take the ca se of a child abducted to California from his home in New York. The 
Convention could not be invoked to s ecure the return of such child.  This is true even if one of 
the child’s parents is an American citizen and the other a foreign national.  The Uniform Child 
Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) and/or the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 
domestic state and federal law, re spectively, would govern the return of the child in question.  If 
the same child were removed from New York to  Canada, application und er the Convention could 
be made to secure the child’s return provided the C onvention had entered into force both for the 
United States and the Canadian province to which the child was taken.  An alternative remedy 
might also lie under other Canadian law.  If th e child had been removed from Canada and taken 
to the United States, the aggrieve d custodial parent in Canada c ould seek to secure the child’s 
return by petitioning for enforcement of a Canadi an custody order pursuant to the UCCJA, or by 
invoking the Convention, or both. 
C. Timing/Cases  Covered  
Article 35 states that the Convention shall apply as between Contracting States only to wrongful 
removals or retentions occurring after its entry into force in those States.  Following a strict 
interpretation of that Article, the Convention wi ll not apply to a child who is wrongfully shifted 
from one Contracting State to another if the wr ongful removal or retention occurred before the 
Convention’s entry into force in those States.  However, under a liberal interpretation Article 35 
could be construed to cover wrongful removal or retention cases wh ich began before the 
Convention took effect but which continued a nd were ongoing after it s entry into force. 
D. Effect  of Custody  Order  Concerning  the Child  
1. Existing Custody Orders 
Children who otherwise fa ll within the scope of the Convent ion are not automatically removed 
from its protections by virtue of a judicial d ecision awarding custody to the alleged wrongdoer.  
This is true whether the decision as to custody  was made, or is entitle d to recognition, in the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-7  
 
 State to which the child has been taken.  Under Article 17 that State cannot refuse to return a 
child solely on the basis of a court order awarding custody to the alleged wrongdoer made by one of its own courts or by the courts of another co untry. This provision is in tended to ensure, inter 
alia, that the Convention takes precedence over decrees made in favor of abductors before the 
court had notice of the wrongf ul removal or retention. 
Thus, under Article 17 the person who wrongfully re moves or retains the ch ild in a Contracting 
State cannot insulate the child from the Convent ion’s return provisions merely by obtaining a 
custody order in the country of ne w residence, or by seeking ther e to enforce another country’s 
order.  Nor may the alleged wrongdoer rely upon a stale decree awarding him or her custody, the 
provisions of which have been *10505  derogated from subseque ntly by agreement or 
acquiescence of the parties, to prevent the ch ild’s return under the Convention.  Article 3. 
It should be noted that Article 17 does permit a c ourt to take into account the reasons underlying 
an existing custody decree wh en it applies the Convention. 
12. Pre-Decree Removals or Retentions Children who are wrongfully removed or retained  prior to the entry of a custody order are 
protected by the Conventi on.  There need not be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the 
Convention’s return provisions. Accordingly, under the Convention a child will be ordered 
returned to the person with whom he or she was habitually resident in pre-decree abduction cases 
as well as in cases involving viol ations of existing custody orders. 
Application of the Convention to pre-decree case s comes to grips with the reality that many 
children are abducted or retained long before custody actions have been initiated.  In this manner 
a child is not prejudiced by the legal inaction of  his or her physical cust odian, who may not have 
anticipated the abduction, and the abductor is de nied any legal advantage since the child is 
subject to the return prov isions of the Convention. 
The Convention’s treatment of pre-decree abducti on cases is distinguisha ble from the Council of 
Europe’s Convention on Recognition and Enforcem ent of Decisions Relating to the Custody of 
Children, adopted in Strasbourg, France in Novemb er 1979 (“Strasbourg C onvention”), and from 
domestic law in the United States, specifically the UCCJA and the PKPA, all of which provide 
for enforcement of custody decrees.  Although the UCCJA and PKPA permit enforcement of a 
decree obtained by a parent in the home state after the child has been removed from that state, in the absence of such decree the en forcement provisions of those laws  are inoperative.  In contrast 
to the restoration of the lega l status quo ante brought about by application of the UCCJA, the 
PKPA, and the Strasbourg Conve ntion, the Hague Convention seeks restoration of the factual 
status quo ante and is not contingent on the ex istence of a custody decree.  The Convention is 
premised upon the notion that the ch ild should be promptly restor ed to his or her country of 
habitual residence so that a c ourt there can examine the merits of the cu stody dispute and award 
custody in the child’s best interests. 
Pre-decree abductions are discusse d in greater detail in the s ection dealing with actionable 
conduct. See II.B(2)(c)(i). 
II. Conduct Actionable Under the Convention 
A. “International  Child  Abduction”  not 
Criminal:Hague  Convention  Distinguished  From  
Extradition  Treaties  NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-8  
 
 Despite the use of the term “abduction” in its ti tle, the Hague Convention is not an extradition 
treaty.  The conduct made actionable by the Conve ntion--the wrongful removal or retention of 
children--is wrongful not in a crimin al sense but in a civil sense. 
The Hague Convention establishes civil procedures to secure the return of so-called “abducted” 
children.  Article 12.  In  this manner the Hague Convention seeks to satisfy the overriding 
concern of the aggrieved parent.  The Convention is not concerned with the question of whether 
the person found to have wrongfully removed or reta ined the child returns to the child’s country 
of habitual residence once the ch ild has been returned pursuant to  the Convention.  This is in 
contrast to the criminal extradition process which is designed to secure the return of the fugitive 
wrong-doer.  Indeed, when the fugitive-parent is  extradited for trial or  to serve a criminal 
sentence, there is no guarantee that th e abducted child will also be returned. 
While it is uncertain whether criminal extr adition treaties will be  routinely invoked in 
international custody cases between countries fo r which the Hague Convention is in force, 
nothing in the Convention bars their application or use. 
B. Wrongful  Removal  or Retention  
The Convention’s first stated obje ctive is to secure the prompt  return of children who are 
wrongfully removed from or retained in any Cont racting State. Article 1(a). (The second stated 
objective, i.e., to ensure that  rights of custody and of access unde r the law of one Contracting 
State are effectively exercised in  other Contracting States (Artic le 1(b)), is discussed under the 
heading “Access Rights,” V., infra.) The removal or retention must be wrongful within the 
meaning of Article 3, as further clarified by Article 5(a), in order to trigger the return procedures 
established by the Convention.  Article  3 provides that the removal or retention of a child is to be 
considered wrongful where: 
(a) it is in breach of custody ri ghts attributed to a person, an institution or another body, either 
jointly or alone, under the law of the State in  which the child was habitually resident 
immediately before the removal or retention; and (b) at the time of  the removal or retention those 
rights were actually exercised, either  jointly or alone, or would have  been so exercised but for the 
removal or retention. 
This Article is a cornerstone of the Convention.  It is anal yzed by examining two questions: 
1. Who holds rights protected by the Convention (or,  with respect to whom is the removal or 
retention deemed to be wrongful);  and 
2. What are the factual and legal elements of a wrongful removal or retention 
1. Holders of Rights Protected by the Convention (a) “Person, institution or other body”. While the child is the ultimate beneficiary of the 
Convention’s judicial and administrative mach inery, the child’s role under the Convention is 
passive.  In contrast, it is up to the “person, in stitution or other body” (hereinafter referred to 
simply as “the person”) who “actually exercised”  custody of the child prior to the abduction, or 
who would have exercised custody but for the ab duction, to invoke the Conve ntion to secure the 
child’s return.  Article 3 (a), (b).  It is this person who hol ds the rights protected by the 
Convention and who has the right to s eek relief pursuant to its terms. 
Since the vast majority of abduc tion cases arises in the context of divorce or separation, the 
person envisioned by Article 3(a) most often will be the child’s parent.  The typical scenario NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-9  
 
 would involve one parent taking a child from one Contracting State to an other Contracting State 
over objections of the parent with whom the child had been living. 
However, there may be situations in which a pers on other than a biological  parent has actually 
been exercising custody of the child and is therefore eligible to seek the ch ild’s return pursuant to 
the Convention.  An example would be a grandpa rent who has had physical custody of a child 
following the death of the parent with whom th e child had been residi ng.  If the child is 
subsequently removed from the custody of the gra ndparent by the surviving parent, the aggrieved 
grandparent could invoke the Conven tion to secure the child’s retu rn.  In another situation, the 
child may be in the care of fost er parents.  If  custody rights exercised by  the foster parents are 
breached, for instance, by abduction of the child by its biological parent, the foster parents 
*10506  could invoke the Convention to secure the child’s return. 
In the two foregoing examples (not intended to be exhaustive) a family relationship existed 
between the victim-child and the person who had th e right to seek the child’s return.  However, 
institutions such as public or private child care agencies also may have custody rights the breach 
of which would be remediable under the Conventi on.  If a natural parent relinquishes parental 
rights to a child and the child is subsequently placed in the care of an adoption agency, that 
agency may invoke the Convention to  recover the child if the child  is abducted by its parent(s). 
(b) “Jointly or alone”. Article 3 (a) and (b) recognize that custody rights may be held either 
jointly or alone.  Two persons, typically mother and father, can exercise joint custody, either by 
court order following a custody ad judication, or by operation of la w prior to the entry of a 
decree.  The Convention does not distinguish betw een these two situations , as the commentary of 
the Convention repor ter indicates: 
Now, from the Convention’s sta ndpoint, the removal of a child  by one of the joint holders 
without the consent of the other,  is wrongful, and this wrongfulne ss derives in this particular 
case, not from some action in breach of a particular law, but from the fact that such action has disregarded the rights of the othe r parent which are also protected by law, and has interfered with 
their normal exercise.  The Convention’s true nature is revealed most clearl y in these situations:  
it is not concerned with establishing the person to whom cust ody of the child will belong at some 
point in the future, nor with the situations in which it may prove necessary to modify a decision awarding joint custody on the basis of facts which have subsequent ly changed.  It seeks, more 
simply, to prevent a later decision on the matter being influenced by a change of circumstances 
brought about through unilateral action by one of the parties. Perez-Vera Report, paragraph 71 at 
447-448. 
Article 3(a) ensures the applica tion of the Convention to pre-decr ee abductions, since it protects 
the rights of a parent who was exercising custody of the child jointly with the abductor at the 
time of the abduction, before th e issuance of a custody decree. 
2. “Wrongful Removal or Retention” Defined The obligation to return an a bducted child to the person entitle d to custody arises only if the 
removal or the retention is wrongful within the meaning of the Conventi on.  To be considered 
wrongful, certain factual and lega l elements must be present. 
(a) Breach of “custody rights”. The removal or re tention must be in breach of “custody rights,” 
defined in Article 5(a) as “rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, 
the right to determine the ch ild’s place of  residence.” NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-10  
 
 Accordingly, a parent who sends his or her chil d to live with a caretaker has not relinquished 
custody rights but rather has exer cised them within the meaning of  the Convention.  Likewise, a 
parent hospitalized for a protracted period wh o places the child with grandparents or other 
relatives for the duration of the illn ess has effectively exercised custody. 
(b) “Custody rights” determined by law of child’s habitual residence. In addition to including the 
right to determine the child’s residence (Artic le 5(a)), the term “custody rights” covers a 
collection of rights which take on more specific meaning by refere nce to the law of the country 
in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention.  Article 3(a). Nothing in the Convention limits this “law” to  the internal law of the State of the child’s 
habitual residence.  Consequently, it could includ e the laws of another State if the choice of law 
rules in the State of habitu al residence so indicate. 
If a country has more than one te rritorial unit, the habitual resi dence refers to the particular 
territorial unit in which the child was resident, and the applicable laws are those in effect in that 
territorial unit.  Article 31.  In the United States, the law in force in the state in which a child was 
habitually resident (as possibly preempted by fede ral legislation enacted in connection with U.S. 
ratification of the Convention) w ould be applicable for the determination as to whether a removal 
or retention is wrongful. 
Articles 32 and 33 also control, respectively, how and whether the Convention applies in States 
with more than one legal system.  Per ez-Vera Report, paragraphs 141 and 142 at 470. 
(c) Sources of “custody rights”. Although the Conven tion does not exhaustiv ely list all possible 
sources from which custody rights may derive, it doe s identify three sources .  According to the 
final paragraph of Article 3, custody rights may aris e:  (1) by operation of law;  (2) by reason of 
a judicial or administrative decision;  or (3) by reason of an agreement having legal effect under 
the law of that State. 
i. Custody rights arising by operati on of law. Custody rights which arise by operation of law in 
the State of habitual residence are protected;  th ey need not be conferred by court order to fall 
within the scope of the Convention. Article 3.  Thus, a person whose child is abducted prior to 
the entry of a custody order is not  required to obtain a custody order in the State of the child’s 
habitual residence as a prerequisite to invoking the Convention’s return provisions. 
In the United States, as a general proposition both  parents have equal rights of custody of their 
children prior to the issuance of a court order allocating rights between them.  If one parent 
interferes with the other’s e qual rights by unilaterally removing or retaining the child abroad 
without consent of the other parent, such inte rference could constitute wrongful conduct within 
the meaning of the Convention. (See excerpts fr om Perez-Vera Report quoted at II.B.1(b), 
supra.) Thus, a parent left in th e United States after a pre-decree a bduction could seek return of a 
child from a Contracting State abroad pursuant to the Convention.  In cases involving children 
wrongfully brought to or retained in the United St ates from a Contracting State abroad prior to 
the entry of a decree, in the absence of an agreement between the parties the question of 
wrongfulness would be resolved by looking to the law of the child’s country of habitual 
residence. 
Although a custody decree is not need ed to invoke the Convention, there are two s ituations in 
which the aggrieved parent may nevertheless be nefit by securing a custody order, assuming the 
courts can hear swiftly a petition for custody. First, to the extent that an award of  custody to the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-11  
 
 left-behind parent (or other pers on) is based in part upon an express finding by the court that the 
child’s removal or retention wa s wrongful within the meaning of Article 3, the applicant 
anticipates a possible request by the judicial authority applying the C onvention, pursuant to 
Article 15, for a court determination of wrongfulness.  This may accelerate disposition of a return petition under the Convention.  Second, a pe rson outside the United States who obtains a 
custody decree from a foreign court subsequent  to the child’s abdu ction, after notice and 
opportunity to be heard have been accorded to  the absconding parent, may be able to invoke 
either the Convention or the UCCJA, or both, to s ecure the child’s return from the United States.  
The UCCJA may be preferable inasmuch as its enforcement provisions are not subject to the 
exceptions contained in the Convention. 
ii. Custody rights arising by r eason of judicial or administ rative decision. Custody rights 
embodied in judicial or *10507  administrative decisions fall w ithin the Convent ion’s scope.  
While custody determinations in the United States  are made by state courts, in some Contracting 
States, notably the Scandinavian countries, ad ministrative bodies are empowered to decide 
matters relating to child custody including the allocation of custody and visitation ri ghts.  Hence 
the reference to “administrative decisions” in Article 3. 
The language used in this part of the Conventio n can be misleading.  Even when custody rights 
are conferred by court d ecree, technically speaking the Convention does not mandate recognition 
and enforcement of that decree. Instead, it seek s only to restore the factual custody arrangements 
that existed prior to the wrongful removal or retention (which incidentally in many cases will be 
the same as those specified by court order). 
Finally, the court order need not have been made by a court in th e State of the child’s habitual 
residence.  It could be one or iginating from a third country. As the reporter points out, when 
custody rights were exercised in the State of the child’s habitu al residence on the basis of a 
foreign decree, the Convention does not require th at the decree have been formally recognized.  
Perez-Vera Report, paragraph 69 at 447. 
iii. Custody rights arising by reason of agreement having legal effect. Parties who enter into a 
private agreement concerning a child’s custody have recourse under the Convention if those 
custody rights are breached.  Article 3.  The onl y limitation is that the agreement have legal 
effect under the law of the ch ild’s habitual residence. 
Comments of the United States with respect to language contained in an  earlier draft of the 
Convention (i.e., that the agreemen t “have the force of law”) shed  some light on the meaning of 
the expression “an agreement having legal effect”.  In the U.S. view, the provision should be 
interpreted expansively to cover more than only t hose agreements that have  been incorporated in 
or referred to in a custody judgment. Actes et documents de la Quatorzieme Session, (1980) 
Volume III. Child Abduction, Comments of G overnments at 240. The reporter’s observations 
affirm a broad interpreta tion of this provision: 
As regards the definition of an agreement which ha s “legal effect” in terms of a particular law, it 
seems that there must be included within it any sort of agreement which is  not prohibited by such 
a law and which may provide a basis for presenti ng a legal claim to the competent authorities.  
Perez-Vera Report, paragraph 70 at 447. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-12  
 
 (d) “Actually exercised”. The most predictable fact pattern under the Convention will involve the 
abduction of a child directly from the parent w ho was actually exercising  physical custody at the 
time of the abduction. 
To invoke the Convention, the holder of custody ri ghts must allege that he or she actually 
exercised those rights at the time of the breach or would have exercised them but for the breach.  
Article 3(b).  Under Article 5, cu stody rights are defined to incl ude the right to determine the 
child’s place of residence.   Thus, if a child is abducted from  the physical custody of the person in 
whose care the child has been entrusted by the cu stodial parent who was “actually exercising” 
custody, it is the parent who placed the child who may make application under the Convention 
for the child’s return. 
Very little is required of the a pplicant in support of the alle gation that custody rights have 
actually been or would have been  exercised.  The applicant need only provide some preliminary 
evidence that he or she actually exercised custod y of the child, for instance, took physical care of 
the child.  Perez-Vera Report, paragraph 73 at 4 48.  The Report points out the informal nature of 
the pleading and proof requirement s;  Article 8(c) merely require s a statement in the application 
to the Central Authority as to “the grounds on whic h the applicant’s claim for return of the child 
is based.” Id. 
In the scheme of the Convention it is pres umed that the person who has custody actually 
exercised it.  Article 13 places on the alleged ab ductor the burden of proving the nonexercise of 
custody rights by the applicant as an exception to the return obligation.  Here , again, the 
reporter’s comments are insightful: 
Thus, we may conclude that the Convention, taken as a whole, is built upon the tacit presumption 
that the person who has car e of the child actually exercises cu stody over it.  This idea has to be 
overcome by discharging the burden of proof wh ich has shifted, as is normal with any 
presumption (i.e. discharged by the “abductor” if he  wishes to prevent the return of the child.)  
Perez-Vera Report paragraph 73 at 449. 
III. Judicial Proceedings for Return of Child 
A. Right  To Seek Return  
When a person’s custody rights have been breac hed by the wrongful remova l or retention of the 
child by another, he or she can seek return of th e child pursuant to the Convention.  This right of 
return is the core of the Convention.  The C onvention establishes two means by which the child 
may be returned.  One is through direct applic ation by the aggrieved person to a court in the 
Contracting State to which the chil d has been taken or in which th e child is being kept. Articles 
12, 29.  The other is through appli cation to the Central Authorit y to be established by every 
Contracting State.  Article 8.  Th ese remedies are not mutually ex clusive;  the aggrieved person 
may invoke either or both of them. Moreover, the aggrieved person may also pursue remedies 
outside the Convention. Articles 18, 29 and 34.  This part of the report describes the 
Convention’s judicial remedy in detail.  The ad ministrative remedy is discussed in IV, infra. 
Articles 12 and 29 authorize any person who clai ms a breach of custody rights within the 
meaning of Article 3 to apply for the child’s return directly to the judicial authorities of the 
Contracting State where the child is located. 
A petition for return pursuant to the Convention may be filed any time after the child has been 
removed or retained up until the child reaches  sixteen. While the window of time for filing may NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-13  
 
 be wide in a particular case without threat of t echnically losing rights under the Convention, 
there are numerous reasons to commence a return proceeding promptly if the likelihood of a voluntary return is remote.  The two most crucial reasons are to preclude adjudication of custody 
on the merits in a country other than the child’s habitual residence (see discussion of Article 16, 
infra) and to maximize the chances for the ch ild’s return by reducing the alleged abductor’s 
opportunity to establish th at the child is settled in a new envi ronment (see discussion of Article 
12, infra). 
A petition for return would be made directly to  the appropriate court in the Contracting State 
where the child is located.  If the return proceed ings are commenced less than one year from the 
date of the wrongful removal or retention, Article 12 requires the court to order the return of the 
child forthwith.  If the return proceedings ar e commenced a year or more after the alleged 
wrongful removal or retention, the court remain s obligated by Article 12 to order the child 
returned unless it is demonstrated that the child is settled in its new environment. 
Under Article 29 a person is not precluded from s eeking judicially-ordered return of a child 
pursuant to laws and procedures  other than the Convention.  Indeed, Articles 18 and 34 make 
clear that nothing in th e Convention limits the power of a cour t to return a child  at any time by 
applying *10508  other laws and procedures  conducive to that end. 
Accordingly, a parent seeking re turn of a child from the United States could petition for return 
pursuant to the Convention, or in the alternative or additionally, for enforcement of a foreign 
court order pursuant to the UCCJA.  For instance, an English father could petition courts in New 
York either for return of his child under the Convention and/or for recognition and enforcement 
of his British custody decree pursua nt to the UCCJA.  If he prev ailed in either  situation, the 
respective court could order the child returned to him in England.  The father in this illustration 
may find the UCCJA remedy swifter than invoking the Convention for the child’s return because 
it is not subject to the exceptions set forth in  the Convention, discussed at III.I., infra. 
B. Legal  Advice  and Costs  
Article 25 provides for the extensio n of legal aid and advice to foreign applicants on the same 
basis and subject only to the same eligibility re quirements as for nationals of the country in 
which that aid is sought. 
Article 26 prohibits Central Authorities from chargi ng applicants for the cost and expenses of the 
proceedings or, where applicable, those arising from the participation of legal counsel or 
advisers.  This provision will be of no help to an  applicant, however, if the Contracting State in 
question has made a reservation in  accordance with Articles 26 and 42 declaring that it shall not 
be bound to assume any costs resulting from the pa rticipation of legal c ounsel or advisers or 
from court proceedings, except insofar as those costs may be covered by its system of legal aid and advice. 
It is expected that the United States will ente r a reservation in accordance with Articles 26 and 
42.  This will place at least the initial burden of paying for couns el and legal proceedings on the 
applicant rather than on the federal government.  Because the reservation is nonreciprocal, use of 
it will not automatically operate to deny applicants  from the United States free legal services and 
judicial proceedings in other Cont racting States.  However, if th e Contracting State in which the 
child is located has itself made use of the reservation in questi on, the U.S. applicant will not be 
eligible for cost-free legal representation and c ourt proceedings.  For more information on costs, NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-14  
 
 including the possibility that the petitioner’s cost s may be levied on the abductor if the child is 
ordered returned, see III.J 2 and IV.C (d) of this analysis. 
C. Pleading  Requirements  
The Convention does not expressly set forth pleadi ng requirements that must be satisfied by an 
applicant who commences a judicial return proceedi ng.  In contrast, Article 8 sets forth the basic 
requirements for an application placed before a Central Authority (discussed IV.C(1), infra) for 
the return of the child.  Since the objective is identical--the child’s return--whether relief is 
sought through the courts or through  intercession of the Central Authority, it follows that a court 
should be provided with at  least as much information as a Cent ral Authority is to  be provided in 
a return application filed in compliance with Arti cle 8.  To ensure that all necessary information 
is provided, the applican t may wish to append to the petition to the court a completed copy of the 
recommended model form for return of a child (see Annex A to this analysis). 
In addition to providing the information set forth in  Article 8, the petition for return should allege 
that the child was wrongfully removed or retain ed by the defendant in violation of custody rights 
that were actually being exercised by the petitioner.  The petition should state the source of the custody rights, the date of the wrongful conduct, a nd the child’s age at that time.  In the prayer 
for relief, the petitioner should request the ch ild’s return and an order for payment by the 
abducting or retaining parent of all fees and expenses incurred to secure the child’s return. 
Any return petition filed in a cour t in the United States pursuant  to the Convention must be in 
English.  Any person in the Unit ed States who seeks return of a child from a foreign court must 
likewise follow the requirements of the foreign st ate regarding translation of legal documents.  
See Perez-Vera Report, pa ragraph 132 at page 467. 
D. Admissibility  of Evidence  
Under Article 30, any application submitted to the Central Authority  or petition submitted to the 
judicial authorities of a Contracting State, and any documents  or information appended thereto, 
are admissible in the courts of the State. Mo reover, under Article 23, no legalization or similar 
formalities may be required.  However, authentication of private documents may be required. 
According to the official report, “any requirement  of the internal law of the authorities in 
question that copies or private documents be au thenticated remains outsi de the scope of this 
provision.” Perez-Vera Report,  paragraph 131 at page 467. 
E. Judicial  Promptitude/Status  Report  
Once an application for return has been filed,  the court is required  by Article 11 “to act 
expeditiously in proceedings for the return of chil dren.” To keep matters on the fast track, Article 
11 gives the applicant or the Ce ntral Authority of the requested  State the right to request a 
statement from the court of the reasons for dela y if a decision on the a pplication has not been 
made within six weeks from the co mmencement of the proceedings. 
F. Judicial
 Notice  
In ascertaining whether there has been a wrongful  removal or retention of a child within the 
meaning of Article 3, Article 14 empowers the cour t of the requested State to take notice directly 
of the law and decisions in the State of the child’s  habitual residence.  Standard procedures for 
the proof of foreign law and for recognition of fo reign decisions would not need to be followed 
and compliance with such procedures is not to be required. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-15  
 
 G. Court  Determination  of “Wrongfulness”  
Prior to ordering a child returned pursuant to Article 12, Artic le 15 permits the court to request 
the applicant to obtain from the authorities of the child’s State of habitual  residence a decision or 
other determination that the al leged removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of 
Article 3. Article 15 does not specify which “aut horities” may render such a determination.  It 
therefore could include agencies of government (e.g., stat e attorneys general) and courts. Central 
Authorities shall assist applicants  to obtain such a decision or determination.  This request may 
only be made where such a decision or dete rmination is obtainable in that State. 
This latter point is particularly important becaus e in some countries the absence of the defendant-
abductor and child from the forum makes it legally impossible to proceed with an action for custody brought by the left-behin d parent.  If an adjudication in such an action were a 
prerequisite to obtaining a determination of wrongfulness, it would be impossible for the 
petitioner to comply with an Article 15 request.   For this reason a re quest for a decision or 
determination on wrongfulness can not be made in  such circumstances consistent with the 
limitation in Article 15.  Ev en if local law permits an adjudi cation of custody in the absence of 
the child and defendant (i.e., post-abduction) or would othe rwise allow a petitioner to obtain a 
determination of *10509  wrongfulness, the provisions of Article  15 will probably not be resorted 
to routinely.  That is so because doing so would convert the purpose of the Convention from 
seeking to restore the factual status quo prior to an abduction to empha sizing substantive legal 
relationships. 
A further consideration in deciding whether to reque st an applicant to comply with Article 15 is 
the length of time it will take to obtain the requ ired determination.  In countries where such a 
determination can be made onl y by a court, if judicial doc kets are seriously backlogged, 
compliance with an Article 15 orde r could significantly pr olong disposition of the return petition, 
which in turn would extend the time that the child is kept in a state of le gal and emotional limbo.  
If “wrongfulness” can be establis hed some other way, for instance by taking judicial notice of the 
law of the child’s habitual residence as permitted by Article 14, the objective of Article 15 can be 
satisfied without further prejudice to the child’s welfare or undue delay of the return proceeding.  
This would also be consistent with the Conventi on’s desire for expeditious judicial proceedings 
as evidenced by Article 11. 
In the United States, a left-behi nd parent or other claimant can petition for custody after the child 
has been removed from the forum.  The right of  action is conferred by the UCCJA, which in 
many states also directs courts to hear such  petitions expeditiously .  The result of such 
proceeding is a temporary or permanent custody determination allocating custody and visitation 
rights, or joint custody rights, between the parties.  Howe ver, a custody determination on the 
merits that makes no reference to the Convention may not by itself satisfy an  Article 15 request 
by a foreign court for a determination as to th e wrongfulness of the con duct within the meaning 
of Article 3.  Therefore, to ensure compliance wi th a possible Article 15 re quest the parent in the 
United States would be well-advise d to request an explicit findi ng as to the wrongfulness of the 
alleged removal or retention within the meani ng of Article 3 in addition to seeking custody. 
H. Constraints  Upon  Courts  in Requested  States  in Making  Substantive  Custody  Decisions  
Article 16 bars a court in the count ry to which the child has been taken or in which the child has 
been retained from considering the merits of custody claims once it has received notice of the 
removal or retention of the child.  The constraints continue either until it is determined that the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-16  
 
 child is not to be returned under the Convention,  or it becomes evident that an application under 
the Convention will not be forthc oming within a reasonable time fo llowing receipt of the notice. 
A court may get notice of a wrongful removal or retention in some manne r other than the filing 
of a petition for retu rn, for instance by communication from  a Central Authority, from the 
aggrieved party (either directly or through counsel), or from a co urt in a Contracting State which 
has stayed or dismissed return proceedings upon removal of the child from that State. 
No matter how notice may be given, once the tri bunal has received notice, a formal application 
for the child’s return pursuant to the Conventi on will normally be filed promptly to avoid a 
decision on the merits from being made. If ci rcumstances warrant a delay in filing a return 
petition, for instance pending the outcome of pr ivate negotiations for th e child’s return or 
interventions toward that end by the Central Au thority, or pending determ ination of the location 
of the child and alleged abductor, the aggrieved party may nevertheless wish to notify the court 
as to the reason(s) for the delay so that inacti on is not viewed as a failure to proceed under the 
Convention. 
I. Duty  To Return  not Absolute  
The judicial duty to order return of a wrongfully  removed or retained ch ild is not absolute.  
Temporal qualifications on this duty are set forth in Articles 12, 4 and 35.  Additionally, Articles 
13 and 20 set forth grounds upon which return may be denied. 
1. Temporal Qualifications Articles 4, 35 and 12 place time lim itations on the return obligation. 
(a) Article 4. Pursuant to Article 4, the Conve ntion ceases to apply once the child reaches age 
sixteen.  This is true regardless of when retu rn proceedings were commenced and irrespective of 
their status at the time of the child’ s sixteenth birthday. See I.A., supra. 
(b) Article 35. Article 35 limits application of the Convention to wrongful removals or retentions 
occurring after its entry into force between the two relevant Contracting States. But see I.C., 
supra. 
(c) Article 12. Under Artic le 12, the court is not obligated to return a child when return 
proceedings pursuant to the Convention are commenced a year or more after the alleged removal or retention and it is de monstrated that the child is settled in  its new environment.  The reporter 
indicates that “(T)he provision do es not state how this fact is to be proved, but it would seem 
logical to regard such  a task as falling upon the abducto r or upon the person who opposes the 
return of the child . . .” Perez-Vera Report, paragraph 109 at page 459. 
If the Convention is to succeed in deterring abductions, the alleged abductor must not be 
accorded preferential treatment by c ourts in his or her country of origin, which, in the absence of 
the Convention, might be prone to favor “home fo rum” litigants.  To this end, nothing less than 
substantial evidence of the chil d’s significant connections to th e new country is intended to 
suffice to meet the respondent’s bu rden of proof.  Moreover, any claims made by the person 
resisting the child’s return will be considered in light of evidence presented by the applicant 
concerning the child’s contacts with and ties to his or her State of ha bitual residence.  The reason 
for the passage of time, which may have made it possible for the child to form ties to the new 
country, is also relevant to the ultimate disp osition of the return pe tition.  If the alleged 
wrongdoer concealed the child’s whereabouts from the custodian necessitating a long search for NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-17  
 
 the child and thereby delayed the commencement of a return proceeding by the applicant, it is 
highly questionable whether the respondent should  be permitted to benefit from such conduct 
absent strong countervailing considerations. 
2. Article 13 Limitations on the Return Obligation (a) Legislative history. In drafting Articles 13 a nd 20, the representatives of countries 
participating in negotiations on th e Convention were aware that a ny exceptions had to be drawn 
very narrowly lest their application undermine the express purposes of th e Convention--to effect 
the prompt return of abducted children.  Furthe r, it was generally believed that courts would 
understand and fulfill the objectives of the Conve ntion by narrowly interpreting the exceptions 
and allowing their use only in clearly mer itorious cases, and only when the person opposing 
return had met the burden of proof.  Importantly, a finding that one or more of the exceptions 
provided by Articles 13 a nd 20 are applicable does not make refusal of a re turn order mandatory.  
The courts retain the discretion to order the child re turned even if they consider that one or more 
of the exceptions applies.  Finally, the word ing of each exception represents a compromise to 
accommodate the different legal systems and te nets of family law in effect in the *10510  
countries negotiating the Convention, the basic purpose in each case being to provide for an 
exception that is narrowly construed. 
(b) Non-exercise of custody right s. Under Article 13(a), the j udicial authority may deny an 
application for the return of a child if the person  having the care  of the child wa s not actually 
exercising the custody rights at the time of the re moval or retention, or  had consented to or 
acquiesced in the removal or retention.  This exception derives from Article 3(b) which makes 
the Convention applicab le to the breach of custo dy rights that were actua lly exercised at the time 
of the removal or retention, or which would have been exercised but for the removal or retention. 
The person opposing return has the burden of pr oving that custody rights were not actually 
exercised at the time of the rem oval or retention, or that the applicant had consented to or 
acquiesced in the removal or retention.  The repor ter points out that proo f that custody was not 
actually exercised does not form an exception to th e duty to return if the dispossessed guardian 
was unable to exercise his rights  precisely because of the action of the abductor.  Perez-Vera 
Report, paragraph 115 at page 461. 
The applicant seeking return need only allege that he or she was actually exercising custody 
rights conferred by the law of the country in which the child was habitually resident immediately 
before the removal or retention.  The statem ent would normally include a recitation of the 
circumstances under which physical custody had b een exercised, i.e., whether by the holder of 
these rights, or by a third person on behalf of  the actual holder of the custody rights.  The 
applicant would append copies of  any relevant legal documents or  court orders to the return 
application. See III. C., supra, and Article 8. 
(c) Grave risk of harm/intolerable situation. Under Article  13(b), a court in it s discretion need not 
order a child returned if there is  a grave risk that return would expose the child to physical harm 
or otherwise place the child in  an intolerable situation. 
This provision was not intended to be used by defenda nts as a vehicle to litigate (or relitigate) the 
child’s best interests.  Only evidence directly es tablishing the existence of a grave risk that would 
expose the child to physical or em otional harm or otherwise pla ce the child in an intolerable NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-18  
 
 situation is material to the c ourt’s determination.  The person  opposing the child’s  return must 
show that the risk to the child  is grave, not merely serious. 
A review of deliberations on the Convention reveals that “intolerable situa tion” was not intended 
to encompass return to a home where money is in short supply, or where educational or other 
opportunities are more limited than in the requested State.  An example of an “intolerable 
situation” is one in which a custodial parent sexually abuses the child.  If the other parent removes or retains the child to safeguard it against further victimization, and the abusive parent then petitions for the child’s return under the Convention, the court may deny the petition.  Such 
action would protect the child from being returned to  an “intolerable situa tion” and subjected to a 
grave risk of psychological harm. 
(d) Child’s preference. The third, unlettered paragr aph of Article 13 permits the court to decline 
to order the child returned if the child objects to being returned and ha s attained an age and 
degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of the child’s views.  As with the other Article 13 exceptions to th e return obligation, th e application of this  exception is not 
mandatory.  This discretionary aspect of Artic le 13 is especially important because of the 
potential for brainwashing of the child by the a lleged abductor.  A child’s objection to being 
returned may be accorded little if any weight if the court believes that the child’s preference is 
the product of the abductor parent ’s undue influence over the child. 
(e) Role of social studies. The final paragraph of Article 13 requi res the court, in considering a 
respondent’s assertion that the child should not be returned, to take into account information 
relating to the child’s social background provide d by the Central Authority or other competent 
authority in the child’s State of habitual re sidence.  This provision has the dual purpose of 
ensuring that the court has a balanced record upon which to determine whether the child is to be 
returned, and preventing the abductor from obtai ning an unfair advantage through his or her own 
forum selection with resulting ready access to evid ence of the child’s living conditions in that 
forum. 
3. Article 20 
Article 20 limits the return obligat ion of Article 12.  It states:  “The return of the child under the 
provisions of Article 12 may be refused if th is would not be permitted by the fundamental 
principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms.” 
The best explanation for this unique formulation is that th e Convention might never have been 
adopted without it.  The negotiati ng countries were divided on th e inclusion of a public policy 
exception in the Convention.  Thos e favoring a public policy exce ption believed that under some 
extreme circumstances not covere d by the exceptions of  Article 13 a court should be excused 
from returning a child to the country of habitu al residence.  In cont rast, opponents of a public 
policy exception felt that such an exception could be interpreted so broadly as to undermine the 
fabric of the entire Convention. 
A public policy clause was nevert heless adopted at one point by a margin of one vote.  That 
clause provided:  “Contracting States may reserv e the right not to return the child when such 
return would be manifestly inco mpatible with the fundamental pr inciples of the law relating to 
the family and children in the St ate addressed.” To prevent immine nt collapse of the negotiating 
process engendered by the adoption of this clause , there was a swift and determined move to NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-19  
 
 devise a different provision that could be invo ked on the rare occasion th at return of a child 
would utterly shock the consci ence of the court or offend al l notions of due process. 
The resulting language of Article 20 has no known precedent in other international agreements to 
serve as a guide in its interpretation.  However,  it should be emphasized that this exception, like 
the others, was intended to be restrictively inte rpreted and applied, and is not to be used, for 
example, as a vehicle for litigating custody on the merits or for passing ju dgment on the political 
system of the country from which the child was re moved.  Two characterizations of the effect to 
be given Article 20 are r ecited below for illumination. 
The following explanation of Article 20 is exce rpted from paragraph 118 of the Perez-Vera 
Report at pages 461-2: 
It is significant th at the possibility, acknowledge d in article 20, that the child may not be returned 
when its return ‘would not be pe rmitted by the fundamental prin ciples of the requested State 
relating to the protection of huma n rights and fundamental freedoms’ has been placed in the last 
article of the chapter:  it was thus intended to emphasize the always clearly exceptional nature of 
this provision’s application.  As  for the substance of this provision, two comments only are 
required.  Firstly, even if its literal meaning is  strongly reminiscent of the terminology used in 
international texts c oncerning the protection *10511  of human rights, this particular rule is not 
directed at developments which have occurred on  the international level,  but is concerned only 
with the principles accepted by the law of the requested State, either through general 
international law and treaty law, or through internal  legislation. Consequently, so as to be able to 
refuse to return a child on the basis of this ar ticle, it will be necess ary to show that the 
fundamental principles of the requested State concerning the subject-ma tter of the Convention do 
not permit it;  it will not be sufficient to show me rely that its return would be incompatible, even 
manifestly incompatible, with these principles.  Secondly, such principles must not be invoked 
any more frequently, nor must their invocation be more readily admissible th an they w ould be in 
their application to purely internal matters.  Othe rwise, the provision would be discriminatory in 
itself, and opposed to one of the most widely rec ognized fundamental principles in internal laws.  
A study of the case law of different countries s hows that the applicatio n by ordinary judges of 
the laws on human rights and fundamental freedom s is undertaken with a care which one must 
expect to see maintained in the internationa l situations which the Convention has in view. 
A.E. Anton, Chairman of the Commission on the Hague Conference of Priv ate International Law 
that drafted the Convention, expl ained Article 20 in his articl e, “The Hague Convention on 
International Child Abduction,” 30 I.C. L.Q. 537, 551-2 (July, 1981), as follows: 
Its acceptance may in part have been due to the f act that it states a rule which many States would 
have been bound to apply in any event, for example,  by reason of the terms of their constitutions.  
The reference in this pr ovision to “the fundamental principles  of the requested State” make it 
clear that the reference is not one  to international conventions or declarations concerned with the 
protection of human rights and fundamental free doms which have been ratified or accepted by 
Contracting States.  It is rather to the fundament al provisions of the law of the requested State in 
such matters . . .  If the United Kingdom decide s to ratify the Hague Convention, it will, of 
course, be for the implementing legislation or th e courts to specify wh at provisions of United 
kingdom law come within the scop e of Article 20.  The Article, however, is merely permissive 
and it is to be hoped that States will exerci se restraint in availing themselves of it. 
4. Custody Order no Defense to Return NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-20  
 
 See I.D.1, supra, for discussion of Article 17. 
J. Return  of the Child  
Assuming the court has determined that the re moval or retention of the child was wrongful 
within the meaning of the Convent ion and that no exceptions to th e return obligation have been 
satisfactorily established by the respondent, Article 12 provides that “the authority concerned 
shall order the return of  the child forthwith.” The Conventio n does not technica lly require that 
the child be returned  to his or her State of habitual re sidence, although in the classic abduction 
case this will occur.  If the petitioner has moved from the child’s State of habitual residence the 
child will be returned to the petitioner,  not the State of habitual residence. 
1. Return Order not on Custody merits Under Article 19, a decision under th e Convention concerning the retu rn of the child shall not be 
taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.  It follows that once the factual 
status quo ante has been restored, litigation concerning custody or vi sitation issues could 
proceed.  Typically this will occur in th e child’s State of habitual residence. 
2. Costs, Fees and Expenses Shifted to Abductor In connection with the return order, Article 26 permits the court to direct the person who 
removed or retained the child to pay necessary expenses incurred by  or on behalf of the applicant 
to secure the child’s return, in cluding expenses, costs incurred or  payments made for locating the 
child, costs of legal representati on of the applicant,  and those of return ing the child.  The 
purposes underlying Article 26 are to restore the applicant to the financial position he or she 
would have been in had there been no removal or  retention, as well as to deter such conduct from 
happening in the first place.  This fee shifting provision has counterparts in the UCCJA (sections 
7(g), 8(c), 15(b)) and the PKPA ( 28 U.S.C. 1738A
 note). 
IV. Central Authority In addition to creating a judi cial remedy for cases of wrongf ul removal and retention, the 
Convention requires each Contract ing State to establish a Centra l Authority (hereinafter “CA”) 
with the broad mandate of assist ing applicants to secure the return of their children or the 
effective exercise of their vis itation rights.  Articles 1, 10, 21.  Th e CA is expressly directed by 
Article 10 to take all appropriate measures to obt ain the voluntary return of children.  The role of 
the CA with respect to visitation rights is discussed in V., infra. 
A. Establishment  of Central  Authority  
Article 6 requires each Contracting State to design ate a Central Authority to discharge the duties 
enumerated in Articles 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 21, 26, 27, and 28. 
In France, the Central Authority is located with in the Ministry of Justice.  Switzerland has 
designated its Federal Justice Offi ce as CA, and Canada has designate d its Department of Justice.  
However, each Canadian province and territory in whic h the Convention has come into force has 
directed its Attorney General to serve as local CA for cases involving that jurisdiction. 
In the United States it is very unlikely that the volume of cases will warrant the establishment of 
a new agency or office to fulfill Convention responsib ilities.  Rather, the du ties of the CA will be 
carried out by an existing agency of the federa l government with experi ence in dealing with 
authorities of other countries. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-21  
 
 The Department of State’s Office of Citizens C onsular Services (CCS) within its Bureau of 
Consular Affairs will most likely serve as  CA under the Hague Conve ntion.  CCS presently 
assists parents here and abroad with child cu stody-related problems within the framework of 
existing laws and procedures. The Convention s hould systematize and expedite CCS handling of 
requests from abroad for assistance in securing the return of children wr ongfully abducted to or 
retained in the United States, and will provide additional tools with whic h CCS can help parents 
in the United States who are seeking return of their children from abroad. 
The establishment of an interagency coordina ting body is envisioned to assist the State 
Department in executing its functions as CA. Th is body is to include representatives of the 
Departments of State, Justice, and Health and Human Services. 
In addition to the mandatory establishment of  a CA in the national government, Contracting 
States are free to appoint similar entities in poli tical subdivisions through out the country.  Rather 
than mandating the establishment of a CA in every st ate, it is expected th at state governments in 
the United States will be requested on a case-by- case basis to render specified assistance, 
consistent with the Convention, aimed at resolvin g international custody and visitation disputes 
with regard to children locat ed within their jurisdiction. 
B. Duties  
Article 7 enumerates the majority of the tasks to  be carried out either directly by the CA or 
through an intermediary.  The CA is to take  “all appropriate measur es” to execute these 
responsibilities.  Although they  are free to do so, the Conventi on does not obligate Contracting 
States to amend their internal laws to discharge *10512  Convention tasks mo re efficaciously. See 
Perez-Vera Report, pa ragraph 63 at page 444. 
The following paragraphs of subsections of Articl e 7 of the Convention are couched in terms of 
the tasks and functions of the United States CA. The correspondi ng tasks and functions of the 
CA’s in other States party to the Convention w ill be carried out somewhat differently in the 
context of each country’s legal system. 
Article 7(a). When the CA in the United States is  asked to locate a child  abducted from a foreign 
contracting State to this country, it would u tilize all existing tools for determining the 
whereabouts of missing persons.  Federal resources availabl e for locating missing persons 
include the FBI-operated National Crime Informati on Center (NCIC) computer (pursuant to Pub. 
L. No. 97- 292, the Missing Children Act), the Fe deral Parent Locator Service (pursuant to 
section 9 of Pub. L. No. 96-611, the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act) and the National 
Center for Missing and Exploite d Children.  If the abductor’s lo cation is known or suspected, the 
relevant state’s Parent Locator Service or Mo tor Vehicle Bureau and the Internal Revenue 
Service, Attorney General and Secretary of Edu cation may be requested to conduct field and/or 
record searches.  Also at the state level, public or private welfare agenci es can be called upon to 
verify discreetly any address information about the abductor that may be discovered. 
Article 7(b). To prevent further harm to the child, the CA would normally call upon the state 
welfare agency to take whatever protective meas ures are appropriate and available consistent 
with that state’s child abuse and neglect laws.  Th e CA, either directly or with the help of state 
authorities, may seek a written agreement from the abductor (and possibly from the applicant as 
well) not to remove the child from the jurisdic tion pending procedures aimed at return of the 
child.  Bonds or other forms of security may be required. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-22  
 
 Article 7(c). The CA, either directly or throug h local public or private mediators, attorneys, 
social workers, or other profe ssionals, would attempt to devel op an agreement for the child’s 
voluntary return and/or resolution of other outstanding issues.  The obligation of the CA to take 
or cause to be taken all appropr iate measures to obtain the volunt ary return of the child is so 
fundamental a purpose of this Conve ntion that it is restated in Ar ticle 10. However, overtures to 
secure the voluntary return of a child may not be  advisable if advance aw areness by the abductor 
that the Convention has been invoked is likely to prompt further flight and concealment of the 
child.  If the CA and state authorities are succe ssful in facilitating a vol untary agreement between 
the parties, the appli cant would have no need to invoke or pursue the Convention’s judicial 
remedy. 
Article 7(d). The CA in the United States woul d rely upon court personnel or social service 
agencies in the child’s state of habitual reside nce to compile information on the child’s social 
background for the use of courts considering excepti ons to a return petition in another country in 
which an abducted or retained ch ild is located. See Article 13. 
Article 7(e). The CA in the United States woul d call upon U.S. state authorities to prepare (or 
have prepared) general statements about the law of the state of th e child’s habitual residence for 
purposes of application of the Convention in th e country where the child is located, i.e., to 
determine whether a removal or retention was wrongful. 
Articles 7 (f) and (g). In the United States the federal CA will not act as legal advocate for the 
applicant.  Rather, in concert w ith state authorities and interested  family law attorneys, the CA, 
through state or local bodies, will  assist the applican t in identifying competent private legal 
counsel or, if eligible, in securing representati on by a Legal Aid or Legal Services lawyer. In 
some states, however, the Attorney General or local District Attorney may be empowered under 
state law to intervene on behalf  of the applicant-parent to secure the child’s return. 
In some foreign Contracting States, the CA may act  as the legal representative of the applicant 
for all purposes unde r the Convention. 
Article 28 permits the CA to require written au thorization empowering it to  act on behalf of the 
applicant, or to designate a repr esentative to act in such capacity. 
Article 7(h). Travel arrangements for the return of  a child from the United States would be made 
by the CA or by state authorities closest to the case in cooperation with the petitioner and/or 
interested foreign author ities.  If it is necessary  to provide short-term care for the child pending 
his or her return, the CA presumably will arrange for the temporary placement of the child in the 
care of the person designated for that purpose by th e applicant, or, faili ng that, request local 
authorities to appoint a guardian, foster parent, et c.  The costs of transp orting the child are borne 
by the applicant unless the court, pursuant to Article 26, orders the wrongdoer to pay. 
Article 7(i). The CA will monito r all cases in which its assistan ce has been sought.  It will 
maintain files on the procedures followed in each case and the ultimate disposition thereof.  Complete records will aid in determining how  frequently the Convention is invoked and how 
well it is working. 
C. Other  Tasks  
1. Processing Applications NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-23  
 
 Article 8 sets forth the required contents of a return application submitted to a CA, all of which 
are incorporated into the model form recomme nded for use when seeking a child’s return 
pursuant to the Convention (see Anne x A of this analysis).  Artic le 8 further provides that an 
application for assistance in securing the return of  a child may be submitted to a CA in either the 
country of the child’s habitual residence or in a ny other Contracting State.  If a CA receives an 
application with respect to a child whom it believe s to be located in anot her Contracting State, 
pursuant to Article 9 it is to transmit the applica tion directly to the appropriate CA and inform 
the requesting CA or applicant of the transmittal. 
It is likely that an applicant who knows the child’s wh ereabouts can expedite the return process 
by electing to file a return appli cation with the CA in the country in which the child is located.  
The applicant who pursues this course of action may also choose to file a duplicate copy of the 
application for information purposes with the CA  in his or her own country . Of course, the 
applicant may prefer to apply di rectly to the CA in his or her own country even when the 
abductor’s location is known, and rely upon the CA to transfer documents and communicate with 
the foreign CA on his or her behalf. An app licant who does not know the whereabouts of the 
child will most likely file the return applicati on with the CA in the child’s State of habitual 
residence. 
Under Article 27, a CA may reject an application if  “it is manifest that the requirements of the 
Convention are not fulfilled or th at the application is otherwise not well founded.” The CA must 
promptly inform the CA in the requesting State, or the applicant directly, of its reasons for such rejection.  Consistent with the spirit of the C onvention and in the absenc e of any prohibition on 
doing so, the applicant should be allowed to co rrect the defects and re file the application. 
Under Article 28, a CA may require the applicant to furnish a written *10513  authorization 
empowering it to act on behalf of  the applicant, or designating a representative so to act. 
2. Assistance in Connection With Judicial Proceedings (a) Request for status report. When an action ha s been commenced in court for the return of a 
child and no decision has been reached by the end of six weeks, Article 11 authorizes the 
applicant or the CA of the requested State to as k the judge for a statemen t of the reasons for the 
delay.  The CA in the country where the child is located may make such a request on its own 
initiative, or upon request of the CA of another C ontracting State.  Replies received by the CA in 
the requested State are to be transmitted to the CA in the requesting State or directly to the 
applicant, depending upon w ho initiated the request. 
(b) Social studies/background reports. Informati on relating to the child ’s social background 
collected by the CA in the child ’s State of habitual residence pursuant to Article 7(d) may be 
submitted for consideration by the court in connec tion with a judicial re turn proceeding.  Under 
the last paragraph of Article 13, the court must consider home studies and other social 
background reports provided by the CA or other competent authori ties in the child’s State of 
habitual residence. 
(c) Determination of “wrongfulne ss”. If a court requests an app licant to obtain a determination 
from the authorities of the child’s State of hab itual residence that the removal or retention was 
wrongful, Central Authoritie s are to assist applicants, so far as practicable, to  obtain such a 
determination. Article 15. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-24  
 
 (d) Costs. Under Article 26, each CA bears its ow n costs in applying the Convention.  The actual 
operating expenses under the C onvention will vary from one Co ntracting State to the next 
depending upon the volume of incoming and outgoing requests and the number and nature of the 
procedures available under internal law to carry out specified Convention tasks. 
Subject to limited exceptions noted in the next paragraph, the Central Authority and other public 
services are prohibited from imposing any charge s in relation to applications submitted under the 
Convention.  Neither the applicant nor the CA in  the requesting State may be required to pay for 
the services rendered directly or indir ectly by the CA of the requested State. 
The exceptions relate to transpor tation and legal expenses to secure the child’s return.  With 
respect to transportation, the CA in the requested State is under no obligation to pay for the 
child’s return.  The applicant can therefore be re quired to pay the costs of transporting the child.  
With respect to legal expenses, if the requested  State enters a reserva tion in accordance with 
Articles 26 and 42, the applicant can be required to pay all costs and expenses of the legal 
proceedings, and those arising from the participati on of legal counsel or advisers.  However, see 
III. J 2 of this analysis discussing the possibility that the court ordering the child’s return will 
levy these and other costs upon the abductor.  Even if the reservation unde r Articles 26 and 42 is 
entered, under Article 22 no security, bond or depos it can be required to guarantee the payment 
of costs and expenses of the judi cial or administrative proceedings  falling within the Convention. 
Under the last paragraph of Article 26 the CA may be able to recover some of its expenses from 
the person who engaged in the wrongful conduct.  For instance, a court that orders a child 
returned may also order the pe rson who removed or retained the child to pay the expenses 
incurred by or on behalf of the petitioner, includi ng costs of court proceedings and legal fees of 
the petitioner.  Likewise, a court that issues an  order concerning visitation may direct the person 
who prevented the exercise of vi sitation rights to pay necessary expenses incurred by or on 
behalf of the petitioner.  In such cases, the pe titioner could recover his or her expenses, and the 
CA could recover its outlays on behalf of the pe titioner, including costs associated with, or 
payments made for, locating the child and the legal representati on of the petitioner. 
V. Access Rights--Article 21 
A. Remedies  for Breach  
Up to this point this analysis has focussed on  judicial and administ rative remedies for the 
removal or retention of child ren in breach of custody ri ghts. “Access rights,” which are 
synonymous with “visitation rights”, are also protect ed by the Convention, but to a lesser extent 
than custody rights.  While the Convention preamb le and Article 1(b) articulate the Convention 
objective of ensuring that rights of access under the law of one state are respected in other 
Contracting States, the remedies for breach of access rights are those enunciated in Article 21 
and do not include the return remedy provided by Article 12. 
B. Defined  
Article 5(b) defines “acc ess rights” as including “t he right to take a child for a limited period of 
time to a place other than the child’s habitual residence.” 
A parent who takes a child from the country of it s habitual residence to another country party to 
the Convention for a summer visit pursuant to eith er a tacit agreement be tween the parents or a 
court order is thus exercising his or her access rights .  Should that parent fail to return the child at 
the end of the agreed upon visita tion period, the retention would be  wrongful and could give rise NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-25  
 
 to a petition for return under Article 12.  If, on the other ha nd, a custodial parent resists 
permitting the child to travel abroad  to visit the noncustodial parent , perhaps out of fear that the 
child will not be returned at th e end of the visit, this interfe rence with access rights does not 
constitute a wrongful retention within the meani ng of Article 3 of the Convention.  The parent 
whose access rights have been infringed is no t entitled under the Convention to the child’s 
“return,” but may request the Cent ral Authority to assist in securing the exercise of his or her 
access rights pursuant to Article 21. 
Article 21 may also be invoked as a precautionary measure by a custodial parent who anticipates 
a problem in getting the child back  at the end of a visit abroad.  That parent may apply to the CA 
of the country where the child is to visit the noncus todial parent for steps to ensure the return of 
the child at the end of the vi sit--for example, through approp riate imposition of a performance 
bond or other security. 
C. Procedure  for Obtaining  Relief  
Procedurally Article 21 authorizes a person compla ining of, or seeking to prevent, a breach of 
access rights to apply to the CA of a Contracti ng State in the same way as a person seeking 
return of the child.  The application would cont ain the information descri bed in Article 8, except 
that information provided under paragraph (c) would be the grounds upon which the claim is 
made for assistance in organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access. 
Once the CA receives such applicat ion, it is to take all appropriate  measures pursuant to Article 7 
to promote the peaceful enjoymen t of access rights and the fulfillm ent of any conditions to which 
the exercise of those rights is subject. This in cludes initiating or facilitating the institution of 
proceedings, either directly or through intermediaries, to organize or protect access rights and to secure respect for conditions to which these rights are subject. 
*10514  If legal proceedings are instituted in the Contracting State in wh ich the noncustodial 
parent resides, Article 21 may not be used by th e noncustodial parent to evade the jurisdiction of 
the courts of the child’s habitual residence, whic h retain authority to de fine and/or condition the 
exercise of visitation right s.  A parent who has a child abroad for a visit is not to be allowed to 
exploit the presence of the child as a means for securing from the CA (or court) in that country 
more liberal visitation rights than those set fort h in a court order agreed upon in advance of the 
visit.  Such result would be tantamount to sanctioning forum-shoppi ng contrary to the intent of 
the Convention.  Any such application should be denied and the parent directed back to the 
appropriate authorities in the State of the child ’s habitual residence fo r consideration of the 
desired modification.  Pending an y such modification, once the la wful visitation period has 
expired, the custodial parent w ould have the right to seek th e child’s return under Article 3. 
The Perez-Vera Report gives some limited guidance as to how CA’s are to cooperate to secure 
the exercise of access rights: 
. . . it would be advisable that the child’s name not appear on th e passport of th e holder of the 
right of access, whilst in ‘trans frontier’ access cases it would be se nsible for the holder of the 
access rights to give an undertaking to the Central Authority of the child’s habitual residence to 
return the child on a particular da te and to indicate also the places  where he intends to stay with 
the child.  A copy of such an unde rtaking would then be sent to  the Central Authority of the 
habitual residence of the holder of the access right s, as well as to the Central Authority of the 
State in which he has stated hi s intention of staying with the child.  This would enable the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-26  
 
 authorities to know the whereabouts of the child at any time and to set in motion proceedings for 
bringing about its return, as s oon as the stated time-limit has e xpired.  Of course, none of the 
measures could by itself ensure that access rights are exercised properly, but in any event we believe that this Report can go no further:  the specific measures which the Central Authorities 
concerned are able to take will depend on the ci rcumstances of each case and on the capacity to 
act enjoyed by each Central Authority. Perez- Vera Report, paragraph 128 at page 466. 
D. Alternative  Remedies  
In addition to or in lieu of  invoking Article 21 to resolve visitation-re lated problems, under 
Articles 18, 29 and 34 an aggrieved parent whose access rights have been violated may bypass 
the CA and the Convention and apply directly to the judicial authorities of a Contracting State 
for relief under othe r applicable laws. 
In at least one case it is foreseeable that a pare nt abroad will opt in favor of local U.S. law 
instead of the Convention.  A noncustodial pare nt abroad whose visi tation rights are being 
thwarted by the custodial  parent resident in the United Stat es could invoke the UCCJA to seek 
enforcement of an existing foreign court orde r conferring visitation ri ghts.  Pursuant to section 
23 of the UCCJA , a state court in the United States coul d order the custodial parent to comply 
with the prescribed visitation peri od by sending the child to the parent outside the United States.  
This remedy is potentially broader and more me aningful than the Convention remedy, since the 
latter does not include the right of return when a custodial pa rent obstructs the noncustodial 
parent’s visitation rights, i.e., by refusing to allow th e other parent to exercise  those rights.  It is 
possible that a parent in the Unite d States seeking to exercise access rights with regard to a child 
habitually resident abroad ma y similarly find greater relief under foreign law than under the 
Convention. 
VI. Miscellaneous and Final Clauses 
A. Article  36 
Article 36 permits Contracting States to limit the restrictions to which a child’s return may be 
subject under the Conventi on, i.e., expand the return obligation or cases to which the Convention 
will apply.  For instance, two or more countries may agree to extend coverage of the Convention 
to children beyond their sixteent h birthdays, thus expanding upon Article 4.  Or, countries may 
agree to apply the Convention retroactively to wr ongful removal and retention cases arising prior 
to its entry into force for those countries. Such agreemen t would remove any ambiguity 
concerning the scope of Article 35. The Departme nt of State is not proposing that the United 
States make use of this Article. 
B. Articles  37 and 38 
Chapter VI of the Hague Conventio n consists of nine final clau ses concerned with procedural 
aspects of the treaty, most of which are self-e xplanatory. Article 37 provi des that states which 
were members of the Hague Conference on Priv ate International Law at the time of the 
Fourteenth Session (October 1980) may sign and become parties to the Convention by ratification, acceptance or approva l. Significantly, under Article 38  the Convention is open to 
accession by non-member States, but enters into force only between those States and member 
Contracting States which specifically accept their accession to the C onvention.  Article 38. 
C. Articles  43 and 44 NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-27  
 
 In Article 43 the Convention provi des that it enters into for ce on the first day of the third 
calendar month after the third country has depos ited its instrument of ratification, acceptance, 
approval or accession.  For countries that become  parties to the Convention subsequently, the 
Convention enters into force on the first day of  the third calendar month following the deposit of 
the instrument of ratification.  Pursuant to Article 43, the C onvention entered into force on 
December 1, 1983 among France, Portugal and five pr ovinces of Canada, and on January 1, 1984 
for Switzerland.  As of January, 1986 it is in for ce for all provinces and territories of Canada 
with the exception of Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Prince Edward Island and Sasketchewan. 
The Convention enters into force in ratifying countries subject to such declarations or 
reservations pursuant to Artic les 39, 40, 24 and 26 (third paragr aph) as may be made by each 
ratifying country in accor dance with Article 42. 
The Convention remains in force for five years fr om the date it first ente red into force (i.e., 
December 1, 1983), and is renewed tacitly every five years absent denunciations notified in 
accordance with Article 44. 
D. Articles  39 and 40 
Article 39 authorizes a C ontracting State to declar e that the Convention exte nds to some or all of 
the territories for the conduct of whose international relations  it is responsible. 
Under Article 40, countries with two or more te rritorial units having different systems of law 
relative to custody and visitation rights may declare that the Convention extends  to all or some of 
them.  This federal state clause was included at  the request of Canada  to take account of 
Canada’s special constitutional situation.  The Department of State is not proposing that the 
United States make use of this provision.  Thus, if the United States ratifies the Convention, it 
would come into force throughout the United States as the supreme law of the land in every state 
and other jurisdiction. 
E. Article  41 
Article 41 is another provision in serted at the request of one c ountry, and is best understood by 
reciting the reporter’s explanatory comments: 
Finally a word should be said on Article 41, si nce it contains a who lly novel provision in *10515  
Hague Conventions.  It also appears in the othe r Conventions adopted at the Fourteenth Session, 
i.e., the Convention on International Access to Jus tice, at the express reque st of the Australian 
delegation. 
This article seeks to make it cl ear that ratification of the Convention by a State will carry no 
implication as to the internal distribution of ex ecutive, judicial and legislative powers in that 
State. 
This may seem self-evident, and this is the po int which the head of the Canadian delegation 
made during the debates of the Fourth Commi ssion where it was decide d to insert such a 
provision in both Conventions (s ee P.-v.  No. 4 of the Plen ary Session).  The Canadian 
delegation, openly expressing the opinion of a la rge number of delegations, regarded the 
insertion of this article in the two Conventi ons as unnecessary.  Nevertheless, Article 41 was 
adopted, largely to satisfy the Australian delega tion, for which the absenc e of such a provision NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page E-28  
 
 would apparently have created insuperable constitutional difficulties.  Perez-Vera Report, 
paragraph 149 at page 472. 
F. Article  45 
Article 45 vests the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Ne therlands, as depository 
for the Convention, with the res ponsibility to notify Hague Conf erence member States and other 
States party to the Convention of all actions material to the operat ion of the Convention. 
Annex A The following model form was recommended by the Fourteenth Session of the Hague 
Conference on Private Internationa l Law (1980) for use in making a pplications pursuant to the 
1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Inte rnational Child Abduction for the return of 
wrongfully removed or retained children.  The vers ion of the form to be used for requesting the 
return of such children from the United States  will probably seek additional information, in 
particular to help authorities in  the United States in efforts to  find a child whose whereabouts are 
not known to the applicant.

 EXHIBIT F—PEREZ-VERA REPORT 
(See: http://www.hcch.net/upload/expl28.pdf ) 
Explanatory Report by Elisa Pérez-Vera 
TRANSLATION OF THE PERMANENT BUREAU 
Introduction 
I Results of the work of the Hague C onference on private international law 
1 The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Ch ild Abduction was adopted on 24 
October 1980 by the Fourteenth Session of the Ha gue Conference on private international law in 
Plenary Session, and by unanimous vote of the States which were present.1 On 25 October 1980, 
the delegates signed the Final Act of the Fourt eenth Session which contained the text of the 
Convention and a Recommendation containing the model form which is to be used in 
applications for the return of children who have been wrongfully abducted or retained. 
On this occasion, the Hague Conference departed  from its usual practice, draft Conventions 
adopted during the Fourteenth Session being made  available for signatur e by States immediately 
after the Closing Session. Four States signed the Convention then (Canada, France, Greece and 
Switzerland), which thus b ears the date 25 October 1980. 
2 As regards the starting point of the proceed ings which resulted in the adoption of the 
Convention, as well as the matter of existing conventions on the s ubject or those di rectly related 
to it, we shall refer to the introduction to the Report of the Special Commission.2 
3 The Fourteenth Session of the Conference, which took place between 6 and 25 October 
1980, entrusted the task of preparing the Conven tion to its First Commission, the Chairman of 
which was Professor A. E. Anton (United Kingdom) and the Vice-Chairman Dean Leal 
(Canada), who had already been Chairman a nd Vice-Chairman respectively of the Special 
Commission. Professor Elisa Pérez-Vera was conf irmed in her position as Reporter. Mr Adair 
Dyer, First Secretary of the Permanent Bureau, who had prepared import ant documents for the 
Conference proceedings, was in charge of th e scientific work of the secretariat. 
4 In the course of thirteen sittings, the First Commission gave a first reading to the 
Preliminary Draft drawn up by th e Special Commission. At the same  time, it named the members 
                                                 
1 Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslova kia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Ireland, Japan, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United 
Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. 
Representatives of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Israel and Italy did not participate in the vote, despite 
having played an active part in the proceedings of  the First Commission. Moro cco, the Holy See and the 
Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics sent observe rs. In the course of the proceedings, the First 
Commission also had at its disposal the invaluable assistance of observers from the Council of Europe, 
the Commonwealth Secretariat and International Social Service. 
2 Report of the Special Commission, Nos 3 and 7 to 15. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-2  
 of a Drafting Committee which drafted the text concurrently with the progress of the main 
proceedings.3 Seven other sittings were devoted to a discussion of the te xt prepared by the 
Drafting Committee,4 as well as of clauses re lating to the application of  the Convention to States 
with non-unified legal systems (‘Applica tion Clauses’) and of the model form5 drafted by ad hoc  
Committees.6 The final clauses had been suggeste d by the Permanent Bureau and were 
incorporated into the preliminary draft Convention drawn up by the Drafting Committee. 
II Aim and structure of this Report 
5 The Explanatory Report on a text which is destined to become positive law, that is to say 
a text which will require to be cited and applied, must fulfill at least tw o essential aims. On the 
one hand, it must throw into relief, as accurately as possible, the principles which form the basis 
of the Convention and, wherever necessary, the development of those ideas which led to such 
principles being chosen from amongst existing op tions. It is certainly not necessary to take 
exhaustive account of the vari ous attitudes adopted  throughout the period during which the 
Convention was being drawn up, but the point of view reflected in the Convention will 
sometimes be more easily grasped by being se t opposite other ideas which were put forward. 
Now, given the fact that the preliminary draf t Convention prepared by the Special Commission 
enjoyed widespread support7 and that the final text essen tially preserves the structure and 
fundamental principles of the Preliminary Draft, th is final Report and in particular its first part, 
repeats certain passages in the Report of the Sp ecial Commission prepared in April 1980, for the 
Fourteenth Session.8 
6 This final Report must also fulfill another purpose, viz. to supply those who have to apply 
the Convention with a detailed commentary on its provisions. Since this commentary is designed 
in principle to throw light upon the literal terms of these provisions, it will be concerned much 
less with tracing their origins than w ith stating their co ntent accurately. 
                                                 
3 The Drafting Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Leal as Vice-Chairman of the First 
Commission, included Messrs Savolainen (Finland), Ch atin (France), Jones (United Kingdom) and the 
Reporter. Mr Dyer and several recording secretarie s provided the Committee with extremely valuable 
assistance. 
4 Working Documents Nos 45, 66, 75, 78, 79 and 83. 
5 Working Document No 59, supplemented by the prop osal of the Secretariat in Working Document No. 
71. The—Subcommittee on ‘Application Clauses’ decide d against changing the terms of the articles on 
this topic which had been prepared by th e Special Commission (Proces-verbal No 12). 
6 The ‘Model Forms’ Subcommittee, under the chai rmanship of Professor Muller-Freienfels (Federal 
Republic of Germany) comprised Me ssrs Deschenaux (Switzerland), He rgen (United States), Barbosa 
(Portugal), Minami (Japan) and Miss Pripp (Swe den). The Subcommittee on ‘Application Clauses’, 
chaired by Mr van Boeschoten (Netherlands), was made  up of Messrs Hetu (Canada), Hjorth (Denmark), 
Creswell (Australia), Salem (Egypt) and Miss Selby (United States).

 7 We can conclude from the foregoing consid erations that these tw o objectives must be 
clearly distinguished and that even the methods of  analysis used cannot be the same for each of 
them. Nevertheless, the need to refer in both cases  to the one text, that of the Convention, implies 
that a certain amount of repetitio n will be necessary and indeed inevitable. Despite this risk and 
in view of the emphasis which is placed on a doubl e objective, the Report has been divided into 
two parts, the first being devoted to a study of  the general principles underlying the Convention, 
the second containing an examinati on of the text, article by article. 
8 Finally, as Professor von Overbeck emphasized in 1977,9 it would be as well to 
remember that this Report was prepared at  the end of the Fourteenth Session, from the procès-
verbaux  and the Reporter’s notes. Thus it has not been approved by the Conference, and it is 
possible that, despite the Rapporter’s efforts to remain objective, certain passages reflect a 
viewpoint which is in part subjective. 
First Part — General characte ristics of the Convention 
9 The Convention reflects on the whole a comp romise between two concepts, different in 
part, concerning the end to be achieved. In fact  one can see in the preliminary proceedings a 
potential conflict between the desi re to protect factual situations  altered by the wrongful removal 
or retention of a child, and that of guaranteeing, in particular, re spect for the legal relationships 
which may underlie such situations. The Convention has struck a rather de licate balance in this 
regard. On the one hand, it is clear that the Convention is not essentially concerned with the 
merits of custody rights (article 19), but on the other hand it is equally clear that the 
characterization of the removal or  retention of a child as wro ngful is made conditional upon the 
existence of a right of custody which gives lega l content to a situati on which was modified by 
those very actions which it is intended to prevent. 
I OBJECT OF THE CONVENTION 
10 The title of this chapter alludes as much to  the problem addressed by the Convention as to 
the objectives by which it seeks to  counter the increase in a bductions. After tackling both of 
these points, we shall deal with other connected questions which appreciably affect the scope of 
the Convention’s objectives, and in particular  the importance which has been placed on the 
interest of the child and on the possible exceptions to the rule re quiring the prompt return of 
children who have been wrongf ully removed or retained. 
A A Definition of the Convention’s subject-matter 
11 With regard to the definition of the Convention’s subject-matter,10 we need only remind 
ourselves very briefly that the situations envisa ged are those which derive from the use of force

Prel. Doc. No 6, May 1980, supra , pp. 172-173. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-4  
 to establish artificial jurisdictional links on an international level, with a view to obtaining 
custody of a child. The variety of different circumstances which can  combine in a particular case 
makes it impossible to arrive at a more precise definition in legal terms. However, two elements 
are invariably present in all cases which have be en examined and confirm the approximate nature 
of the foregoing characterization. 
12 Firstly, we are confronted in each case with the removal from its habitual environment of 
a child whose custody had been entrusted to and lawfully exercised by a natural or legal person. Naturally, a refusal to restore a child to its own environment after a stay abroad to which the person exercising the right of cu stody had consented must be put  in the same category. In both 
cases, the outcome is in fact the same: the child is  taken out of the family and social environment 
in which its life has developed. What is more, in  this context the type of legal title which 
underlies the exercise of custody rights over the child matters li ttle, since whether or not a 
decision on custody exists in no way alters the soci ological realities of the problem. 
13 Secondly, the person who removes the child (o r who is responsible for its removal, where 
the act of removal is un dertaken by a third party) hopes to obtain a right of custody from the 
authorities of the country to which the child ha s been taken. The problem  therefore concerns a 
person who, broadly speaking, belongs to the family ci rcle of the child; indee d, in the majority of 
cases, the person concerned is the father or mother. 
14 It frequently happens that the person retaining the child tries to obtain a judicial or 
administrative decision in the State of refuge, which would legalize the factual situation which 
he has just brought about. Howeve r, if he is uncertain  about the way in wh ich the decision will 
go, he is just as likely to opt for inaction, leaving it up to  the dispossessed party to take the 
initiative. Now, even if the latter acts quickly, th at is to say manages to  avoid the consolidation 
through lapse of time of the situation brought abou t by the removal of the child, the abductor will 
hold the advantage, since it is he who has chosen the forum in which the case is to be decided, a 
forum which, in principle, he regards as more favourable to his own claims. 
15 To conclude, it can firmly be stated that  the problem with which the Convention deals — 
together with all the drama implicit in the fact th at it is concerned with the protection of children 
in international relations — derives all of its le gal importance from the po ssibility of individuals 
establishing legal and jurisdictional links which are more or less artificial. In fact, resorting to this expedient, an individual can change the applicable law and obtai n a judicial decision 
favourable to him. Admittedly, such a decision, especially one coexisting with others to the 
opposite effect issued by the other forum, will enjoy only a limited geogra phical validity, but in 
any event it bears a legal title sufficient to ‘lega lize’ a factual situation which none of the legal 
systems involved wished to see brought about. 
B The objectives of the Convention 
16 The Convention’s objects, which appear in article 1, can be summarized as follows: since 
one factor characteristic of the situations under  consideration consists in the fact that the 
abductor claims that his action has been rendered lawful by the competent au thorities of the State 
of refuge, one effective way of de terring him would be to deprive his actions of any practical or 
juridical consequences. The Convention, in order to  bring this about, places at the head of its NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-5  
 objectives the restoration of the status quo , by means of ‘the prom pt return of children 
wrongfully removed to or retained in any C ontracting State’. The in surmountable difficulties 
encountered in establishing, w ithin the framework of the C onvention, directly applicable 
jurisdictional rules11 indeed resulted in this route being followed which, although an indirect one, 
will tend in most cases to allow a final decision  on custody to be taken by the authorities of the 
child’s habitual residence prior to its removal. 
17 Besides, although the object stated in sub-paragraph b, ‘to ensure that rights of custody 
and of access under the law of one Contracting St ate are effectively respected in the other 
Contracting States’ appears to st and by itself, its teleological c onnection with the ‘return of the 
child’ object is no less evident. In reality, it can be regarded as one singl e object considered at 
two different times; whilst the prompt return of th e child answers to the de sire to re-establish a 
situation unilaterally and forcibly altered by the abductor, effective respect for rights of custody 
and of access belongs on the preventive level, in so  far as it must lead to the disappearance of 
one of the most frequent causes of child abductions. 
Now, since the Convention does not specify the m eans to be employed by each State in bringing 
about respect for rights of  custody which exist in another Cont racting State, one must conclude 
that, with the exception of the i ndirect means of protecting cust ody rights which is implied by the 
obligation to return the child to  the holder of the right of cu stody, respect for custody rights falls 
almost entirely out with the scope of the Conve ntion. On the other hand, rights of access form 
the subject of a rule which, although undoubtedly incomplete, nevertheless is indicative of the 
interest shown in ensuring regul ar contact between parents and children, even when custody has 
been entrusted to one of the parents or to a third party. 
18 If the preceding considerati ons are well-founded, it must be concluded that any attempt to 
establish a hierarchy of objects of the Conventi on could have only a symbolic significance. In 
fact, it would seem almost impossible to create  a hierarchy as between two objects which spring 
from the same concern. For at the end of the day, promoting the return of the child or taking the 
measures necessary to avoid such rem oval amount to almost the same thing. 
Now, as will be seen below, the one matter whic h the Convention has tried to regulate in any 
depth is that of the return of children wrongfully  removed or retained. The reason for this seems 
clear: the most distressing situa tions arise only after the unlawful retention of a child and they are 
situations which, while requiring particularly urge nt solutions, cannot be re solved unilaterally by 
any one of the legal systems concerned. Taken as a whole, all these circumstances justify, in our 
opinion, the Convention’s development of rules for regulating the return of  the child, whilst at 
the same time they give in principle a certain prio rity to that object. T hus, although theoretically 
the two above-mentioned objects ha ve to be placed on the same le vel, in practice the desire to 
guarantee the re-establishment of  the status quo disturbed by the actions of the abductor has 
prevailed in the Convention. 
                                                 
11 Such an option was rejected in the course of  the first meeting of the Special Commission. Cf. 
Conclusions drawn from the discussions of the Special Commission of March 1979  on legal kidnapping, 
prepared by the Permanent Bureau , Prel. Doc. No 5, June 1979, supra , pp. 163-164. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-6  
 19 In a final attempt to clarify the objects of the Convention, it would be advisable to 
underline the fact that, as is show n particularly in the provisions of article 1, the Convention does 
not seek to regulate the problem of the award of  custody rights. On this matter, the Convention 
rests implicitly upon the principle that a ny debate on the merits of the question, i.e. of custody 
rights, should take place before  the competent authorities in th e State where the child had its 
habitual residence prior to its removal; this applie s as much to a removal which occurred prior to 
any decision on custody being taken — in which cas e the violated custody rights were exercised 
ex lege  — as to a removal in breach of  a pre-existing custody decision. 
C Importance attached to the interest of the child 
20 Above all, one has to jus tify the reasons for including an  examination of this matter 
within the context of a consideration of the Convention’s objects.  These reasons will appear 
clearly if one considers, on the one hand, that the interests of the child are often invoked in this 
regard, and on the other hand, that it might be argu ed that the Convention’ s object in securing the 
return of the child ought always to be subordinated to a consideration of th e child’s interests. 
21 In this regard, one fact has rightly been highlighted, viz. that ‘the legal standard ‘the best 
interests of the child’ is at first view of such va gueness that it seems to resemble more closely a 
sociological paradigm than a co ncrete juridical standard. How can  one put flesh on its bare bones 
without delving into the assumptions concerning the ultimate  interests of a child which are 
derived from the moral framework of a particular  culture? The word ‘ultimate’ gives rise to 
immediate problems when it is inserted into th e equation since the general statement of the 
standard does not make it clear whether the ‘interes ts’ of the child to be served are those of the 
immediate aftermath of the decision, of the adolescence of the child, of young adulthood, 
maturity, senescence or old age’.12 
22 On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that  it is by invoking ‘the best interests of the 
child’ that internal jurisdictions have in the pa st often finally awarded the custody in question to 
the person who wrongfully removed or retained th e child. It can happen th at such a decision is 
the most just, but we cannot ignore  the fact that recourse by intern al authorities to  such a notion 
involves the risk of their expressi ng particular cultural, social etc. attitudes which themselves 
derive from a given national community and thus  basically imposing their own subjective value 
judgments upon the national community from which the child has recently been snatched. 
23 For these reasons, among others, the dispos itive part of the Convention contains no 
explicit reference to the interests of the child to the extent of their qualifying the Convention’s 
stated object, which is to secure the prompt return of children who have been wrongfully 
removed or retained. However, its silence on this  point ought not to lead  one to the conclusion 
that the Convention ignores the so cial paradigm which declares th e necessity of considering the 
interests of children in regulat ing all the problems which concer n them. On the contrary, right 
from the start the signatory States  declare themselves to be ‘firmly  convinced that the interests of 
children are of paramount importance in matters re lating to their custody’; it is precisely because 
of this conviction that they drew up the Convent ion, ‘desiring to protect children internationally 
from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention’. 
                                                 
12 Dyer Report, supra , pp. 22-23. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-7  
 24 These two paragraphs in the preamble reflect quite clearly the philosophy of the 
Convention in this regard. It ca n be defined as follows: the str uggle against the gr eat increase in 
international child abductions must always be inspired by the desire to protect children and 
should be based upon an interpretation of their true interests. Now, the right  not to be removed or 
retained in the name of more or less arguabl e rights concerning its person is one of the most 
objective examples of what constitu tes the interests of the child. In this regard it would be as well 
to refer to Recommendation 874(1979) of the Par liamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, 
the first general principle of whic h states that ‘children must no longer be regarded as parents’ 
property, but must be recognised as indivi duals with their ow n rights and needs’.13 
In fact, as Mr Dyer has emphasized, in the litera ture devoted to a study of this problem, ‘the 
presumption generally stated is th at the true victim of the ‘chi ldnapping’ is the child himself, 
who suffers from the sudden upsetting of his stab ility, the traumatic loss of contact with the 
parent who has been in charge of his upbringing, the uncertainty and frustration which come with 
the necessity to adapt to a strange language, unf amiliar cultural conditions and unknown teachers 
and relatives’.14 
25 It is thus legitimate to assert that the tw o objects of the Convention — the one preventive, 
the other designed to secure th e immediate reintegration of the child into its habitual 
environment — both correspond to a specific idea of what constitutes the ‘best interests of the child’. However, even when viewing from this perspective, it has to be admitted that the removal of the child can sometimes be justified by objective reasons which have to do either with its person, or with the environmen t with which it is most cl osely connected. Therefore the 
Convention recognizes the need fo r certain exceptions to the ge neral obligations assumed by 
States to secure the prompt re turn of children who have been unlawfully removed or retained. 
For the most part, these exceptions are only concrete illustrations of the overly vague principle whereby the interests of the child are stated  to be the guiding crit erion in this area. 
26 What is more, the rule concerning access ri ghts also reflects the concern to provide 
children with family relationships which are as comprehensive as possible, so as to encourage 
the development of a stable personality. Howe ver, opinions differ on this, a fact which once 
again throws into relief the ambi guous nature of this principle of  the interests of the child. In 
fact, there exists a school of thought opposed to the test which has been accepted by the 
Convention, which maintains that it is better for th e child not to ha ve contact with both parents 
where the couple are separa ted in law or in fact. As to this, the Conference was aw are of the fact 
that such a solution could sometimes prove to be the most appropriate. Whilst safeguarding the 
element of judicial discretion in individual cases, th e Conference nevertheless chose the other 
alternative, and the Convention upholds unequivocally the idea that  access rights are the natural 
counterpart of custody rights, a counterpart which must in principle be acknowledged as 
belonging to the parent who does not have custody of the child. 
D Exceptions to the duty to secure the prompt return of children 
                                                
 
13 Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. 31st Ordinary Session, Recommendation on a 
European Charter on the Rights of the Child . Text adopted on 4 October 1979. 
14 Dyer Report, supra , p. 21. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-8  
 27 Since the return of the child is to some extent the basic pr inciple of the Convention, the 
exceptions to the general duty to secure it form an important element in understanding the exact 
extent of this duty. It is not of course nece ssary to examine in detail the provisions which 
constitute these exceptions, but merely to sketch  their role in outline, while at the same time 
stressing in particular the reasons  for their inclusion in the Conve ntion. From this vantage point 
can be seen those exceptions which derive thei r justification from three different principles. 
28 On the one hand, article 13 a accepts that the judicial or ad ministrative authorities of the 
requested State are not bound to order the return of  the child if the pers on requesting its return 
was not actually exercising, prior to the allegedl y unlawful removal, the rights of custody which 
he now seeks to invoke, or if he had subsequen tly consented to the act which he now seeks to 
attack. Consequently, the situations envisaged are those in wh ich either the conditions prevailing 
prior to the removal of the ch ild do not contain one of the elements essential to those 
relationships which the Conventio n seeks to protect (that of th e actual exercise  of custody 
rights), or else the subsequent behaviour of the dispossessed pa rent shows his acceptance of the 
new situation thus brought about, which ma kes it more difficult for him to challenge. 
29 On the other hand, paragraphs l b and 2 of the said article 13 contain exceptions which 
clearly derive from a considera tion of the interests of  the child. Now, as we pointed out above, 
the Convention invests this notion with definite content. Thus, th e interest of the child in not 
being removed from its habitual residence without sufficient guarantees of its stability in the new 
environment, gives way before the primary interest of any pe rson in not be ing exposed to 
physical or psychological da nger or being placed in an intolerabl e situation. 
30 In addition, the Convention al so provides that the child’s views concerning the essential 
question of its return or retention may be conc lusive, provided it has, according to the competent 
authorities, attained an age and degree of maturity sufficient fo r its views to be taken into 
account. In this way, the Convention gives childre n the possibility of interpreting their own 
interests. Of course, this pr ovision could prove dangerous if it were applied by means of the 
direct questioning of young people who may admittedly have a clear grasp of the situation but 
who may also suffer serious psychological harm if  they think they are being forced to choose 
between two parents. However, su ch a provision is absolutely necessary given the fact that the 
Convention applies, ratione personae , to all children under the age of  sixteen; the fact must be 
acknowledged that it would be very difficult to accept that a child of, for example, fifteen years 
of age, should be returned against its will. Moreover , as regards this particular point, all efforts to 
agree on a minimum age at which the views of the child could be taken in to account failed, since 
all the ages suggested seemed artific ial, even arbitrary. It seemed best to leave the application of 
this clause to the discretion of the competent authorities. 
31 Thirdly, there is no obligation to return a ch ild when, in terms of article 20, its return 
‘would not be permitted by the fundamental princi ples of the requested State relating to the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms’. Here, we  are concerned with a provision 
which is rather unusual in conventions involving pr ivate international law, and the exact scope of 
which is difficult to define. Although we shall refer to the commentary on article 20 for the purpose of defining such scope, it is particularly inte resting to consider its origins here. This rule 
was the result of a compromise between those de legations which favoured, and those which were 
opposed to, the inclusion in the Conv ention of a ‘public policy’ clause. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-9  
 The inclusion of such a clause was debated at  length by the First Comm ission, under different 
formulations. Finally, after four votes against inclusion, the Commission accepted, by a majority 
of only one, that an application for the return of a child could be refused, by reference to a 
reservation which took into acc ount the public policy ex ception by way of a restrictive formula 
concerning the laws governing the family and child ren in the requested State. The reservation 
provided for was formulated exactl y as follows: ‘Contracting States may reserve the right not to 
return the child when such re turn would be manifestly inco mpatible with the fundamental 
principles of the law relating to the family and children in the State addressed’.15 The adoption of 
this text caused a serious breach in the consensus which basically had prevailed up to this point in the Conference proceedings. That is why all th e delegations, aware of th e fact that a solution 
commanding wide acceptance had to be found, em barked upon this road which provided the 
surest guarantee of the success of the Convention. 
32 The matter under debate was par ticularly important since to so me extent it reflected two 
partly different concepts concer ning the Convention’s objects as re gards the return of the child. 
Actually, up to now the text drawn up by the Fi rst Commission (like the Preliminary Draft drawn 
up by the Special Commission) had limited the po ssible exceptions to the rule concerning the 
return of the child to a consideration of factual si tuations and of the conduc t of the parties or to a 
specific evaluation of the interest s of the child. On the other ha nd, the reservation just accepted 
implicitly permitted the possibility of the return of a child being refused on the basis of purely 
legal arguments drawn from the internal law of th e requested State, an internal law which could 
come into play in the context of  the quoted provision either to ‘e valuate’ the right claimed by the 
dispossessed parent or to assess whether the action of the abductor wa s well-founded in law. 
Now, such consequences would alter considerably  the structure of the Convention which is based 
on the idea that the forcible denial of jurisdic tion ordinarily possessed by the authorities of the 
child’s habitual residence should be avoided. 
33 In this situation, the adoption by a comforting majority
16 of the formula which appears in 
article 20 of the Convention represents a la udable attempt to compromise between opposing 
points of view, the role given to the internal law of the State of refuge having been considerably 
diminished. On the one hand, the reference to  the fundamental principles concerning the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms relates to an area of law in which there are 
numerous international agreements. On the other hand, the rule in article 20 goes further than the 
traditional formulation of ‘public policy’ clauses as  regards the extent of incompatibility between 
the right claimed and the action envisaged. In fact, th e authority concerned, in order to be able to 
refuse to order the retu rn of the child by invoki ng the grounds which app ear in this provision, 
must show not only that such a contradiction exists, but also th at the protective principles of 
human rights prohibit th e return requested. 
34 To conclude our consideration of the problem s with which this paragraph deals, it would 
seem necessary to underline the fa ct that the three type s of exception to the rule concerning the 
return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all 
that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the C onvention is not to become a dead 
                                                 
15 See P.-v. No 9 and associated Working Documents. 
16 The text was adopted with 14 votes in favor, 6 against and 4 abstentions, see P. -v. No 13. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-10  
 letter. In fact, the Convention as  a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon 
of illegal child removals and upon the conviction that the best way to combat them at an 
international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practic al application of this 
principle requires that the signa tory States be convinced th at they belong, despite their 
differences, to the same legal community within  which the authorities of each State acknowledge 
that the authorities of one of th em — those of the child’s habitual residence — are in principle 
best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation 
of the said exceptions, substituting the forum c hosen by the abductor for that of the child’s 
residence, would lead to the co llapse of the whole structure of  the Convention by depriving it of 
the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration. 
II NATURE OF THE CONVENTION 
A A convention of co-operation among authorities 
35 By defining the ends pursued by the Contra cting States, a conven tion’s objects in the 
final analysis determine its natu re. Thus, the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International 
Child Abduction is above all a convention which s eeks to prevent the inte rnational removal of 
children by creating a system of close co-operation among the judicial and administrative 
authorities of the Contracting States. Such coll aboration has a bearing on the two objects just 
examined, viz. on the one hand, obtaining the prompt return  of the child to th e environment from 
which it was removed, and on the other hand the effective respect for rights of custody and 
access which exist in one of  the Contracting States. 
36 This description of the Conve ntion can also be drawn in a negative way. Thus, it can be 
said at the outset that the Conve ntion is not concerned with the law applicable to the custody of 
children. In fact, the references to the law of th e State of the child’s habitual residence are of 
limited significance, since the law in question is ta ken into consideration only so as to establish 
the wrongful nature of the rem oval (see, for example, article 3). Secondly, the Convention is 
certainly not a treaty on the recognition and enfo rcement of decisions on custody. This option, 
which gave rise to lengthy debates during th e first meeting of the Special Commission, was 
deliberately rejected. Due to the substantive cons equences which flow from the recognition of a 
foreign judgment, such a treaty is ordinarily  hedged around by guarantee s and exceptions which 
can prolong the proceedings. Now, where the removal of a child is concerne d, the time factor is 
of decisive importance. In fact , the psychological problems which a child may suffer as a result 
of its removal could reappear if a decision on its return were to be taken only after some delay. 
37 Once it is accepted that we are dealing with a convention which is centred upon the idea 
of co-operation amongst authorities, it must also be  made clear that it is designed to regulate only 
those situations that come with in its scope and which involve tw o or more Contracting States. 
Indeed, the idea of a ‘universalist’ convention ( i.e. a convention which applies in every 
international case) is difficult to sustain outwith  the realm of conventions on applicable law. In 
this regard, we must remember that the systems which have been designed either to return children or to secure the actua l exercise of access rights, depend largely on co-operation among 
the Central Authorities, a co-ope ration which itself rests upon the notion of recipr ocal rights and 
duties. In the same way, when individuals, by invoking the provisions of  the Convention, apply 
directly to the judicial or admini strative authorities of a Contracti ng State, the applicability of the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-11  
 Convention’s benefits will itse lf depend on the concept of r eciprocity which in principle 
excludes its being extended to nationals of third countries. 
What is more, although the Convention attain s its objectives in full only as among the 
Contracting States, the authorities in each of those States have th e absolute right to be guided by 
the provisions of the Convention when d ealing with other, similar situations. 
B The autonomous nature of the Convention 
38 The Convention, centred as it  is upon the notion of co-ope ration among authorities with a 
view to attaining its stated obj ects, is autonomous as regards ex isting conventions concerning the 
protection of minors or custody ri ghts. Thus, one of the first decisions taken by the Special 
Commission was to direct its proceedings toward s the drawing up of an independent Convention, 
rather than the preparation of a protocol to the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning 
the powers of authorities and the law app licable to the protection of minors . Seen from this 
perspective, the Convention could not possibly be confined within th e framework provided by 
the conventions on the recognition and enforcement of custody decisions, including that of the 
Council of Europe Convention.17 
39 This autonomous character do es not mean that the provisi ons purport to re gulate all the 
problems arising out of international child abductions. On the contrary, to the extent that the Convention’s aims, although ambitious, are given concrete expression, the basic problem of 
custody rights is not to be found within the scope of the Convention. The Convention must 
necessarily coexist with the rules of each C ontracting State on applicable law and on the 
recognition and enforcement of foreign decrees, qu ite apart from the fact  that such rules are 
derived from internal law or from treaty provisions. 
On the other hand, even within its own sphere of  application, the Convention does not purport to 
be applied in an exclusive way. It seeks, above all,  to carry into effect th e aims of the Convention 
and so explicitly recognizes th e possibility of a part y invoking, along with th e provisions of the 
Convention, any other lega l rule which may allow him to obtai n the return of a child wrongfully 
removed or retained, or to orga nize access rights (article 34). 
C Relations with other conventions 
40 The Convention is designed as a means for bringing about speedy solutions so as to 
prevent the consolidation in la w of initially unlawful factua l situations, br ought about by the 
removal or retention of a child. In as much as it does not seek to deci de upon the merits of the 
rights of parties, its compatibility with other co nventions must be considered. Nonetheless, such 
compatibility can be achieved only by ensuring th at priority is given to  those provisions which 
are likely to bring about a speedy and, to some ex tent, temporary solution. In  fact it is only after 
the return of the child to its habitual residen ce that questions of custody rights will arise before 
                                                
 
17 The European Convention on Recogn ition and Enforcement of Decisi ons Concerning Custody of 
Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children , adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the 
Council of Europe on 30 November 1979 and opened fo r signing by the Member States at Luxemburg on 
20 May 1980. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-12  
 the competent tribunals. On this point, article 34 states that ‘This Conven tion shall take  priority 
in matters within its scope over the Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of 
authorities and the law applicable in re spect of the protection of minors , as between Parties to 
both Conventions.’ Moreover, sinc e one is trying to avoid delays  in the application of the 
Convention’s provisions caused by claims concerni ng the merits of custody rights, the principle 
in article 34 ought to be extended to any pr ovision which has a bearing upon custody rights, 
whatever the reason. On the other hand, as has just  been emphasized in the preceding paragraph, 
the parties may have recourse to  any rule which promotes the realization of the Convention’s 
aims. 
D Opening of the Convention to States not Members of the Hague Conference 
41 On this point also, by virtue of the deci sion that it be of a ‘semi-open’ type, the 
Convention is shown to be one of co-operati on. In principle, any State can accede to the 
Convention, but its accession ‘will have effect only as regards the relations between the acceding 
State and such Contracting States as will have de clared their acceptance of the accession’ (article 
38). The Contracting States, by this means, sought  to maintain the requ isite balance between a 
desire for universality and the belief that a syst em based on co-operation c ould work only if there 
existed amongst the Contracting Parties a sufficient degree of mutual confidence. 
What is more, the choice of a system based on the express acceptance of accession by each 
Member State, by which such acceptance becomes effective as amongst themselves,18 in 
preference to a more open system by which a ccession has effect except as regards Member 
States which raise objections thereto within a certain period of time,19 demonstrates the 
importance which the States attached to the selec tion of their co-signatori es in those questions 
which form the subject-matter of the Convention. 
III INSTRUMENTS FOR APPLYI NG THE CONVENTION 
A The Central Authorities 
42 A convention based on co-operation such as the one which concerns us here can in theory 
point in two different directi ons; it can impose dir ect co-operation among competent internal 
authorities, in the sphere of the Convention’s application, or it can ac t through the creation of 
Central Authorities in each Contra cting State, so as to coordinate and ‘channel’ the desired co-
operation. The Preliminary Draft drawn up by the Special Commission expr essed quite clearly 
the choice made in favour of the second option, and the Convention itself was also built in large 
measure upon the intervention and powers of Central Authorities. 
43 Nevertheless, the unequivocal acceptance of  the possibility for individuals to apply 
directly to the judicial or administrative author ities which have power to apply the provisions of 
the Convention (article 29), incr eases the importance of the duty of co-operation laid upon them, 
                                                 
18 As in article 39 of the Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or 
Commercial Matters , see P.-v. No 13. 
19 The system adopted, among others, by the Convention on International Access to Justice , also adopted 
during the Fourteenth Session of the Conference. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-13  
 so much so that the system adopted by the C onvention could be characterized as a ‘mixed 
system’, due to the fact that, aside from th e duties imposed upon the Central Authorities, it 
creates other obligations which are peculiar to  judicial or administ rative authorities. 
44 What is more, it would be a mistake to clai m to have constructed a convention to counter 
international child abduction wit hout taking account of the important  role played by the internal 
judicial or administrative authorities in all matte rs concerning the protec tion of minors. In this 
context, references to administrative authorities must be understood as a simple reflection of the 
fact that, in certain Member States , the task in question is entruste d to such authorities, while in 
the majority of legal systems jurisdicti on belongs to the judi cial authorities. In fine , it is for the 
appropriate authorities within each  State to decide questions of custody and protection of minors; 
it is to them that the Convention has entrusted the responsib ility of solving the problems which 
arise, whether they involve the return of a child  wrongfully removed or retained or organizing 
the exercise of access rights. Thus, the Convent ion adopts the demand for legal certainty which 
inspires all internal la ws in this regard. In fact, although decisions concerni ng the return of 
children in no way prejudge the mer its of any custody issue (see ar ticle 19), they will in large 
measure influence children’s lives; such decision s and such responsibili ties necessarily belong 
ultimately to the authorities which ordinarily have jurisdiction according to internal law. 
45 However, the application of the Convention, both in its br oad outline and in the great 
majority of cases, will depend on the working of the instruments which we re brought into being 
for this purpose, i.e. the Central Authorities. So far as their regulation by the Convention is 
concerned, the first point to be made is th at the Conference was aware of the profound 
differences which existed as regards the internal organization of the Contra cting States. That is 
why the Convention does not define the structure and capacity to act of the Central Authorities, 
both of which are necessarily governed by the inte rnal law of each Contra cting State. Acceptance 
of this premise is shown in the Convention by its recognition of the fact that the tasks 
specifically assigned to Central Au thorities can be performed eith er by themselves, or with the 
assistance of intermediaries (article 7). For ex ample, it is clear that discovering a child’s 
whereabouts may require the intervention of the police; similarly, the adoption of provisional 
measures or the institution of legal proceedings  concerning private relatio nships may fall outwith 
the scope of those powers which can be devolve d upon administrative aut horities in terms of 
some internal laws. Nonetheless, the Central Authority in every case remains the repository of those duties which the Convention imposes upon it, to the extent of its being the ‘engine’ for the 
desired co-operation which is designed to counter  the wrongful removal of children. On the other 
hand, it is so as to take account of the peculiarities of different legal systems that the Convention 
allows a Central Authority to require that ap plications addressed to it be accompanied by a 
‘written authorization empowering it to act on behalf of the applicant, or to designate a 
representative so to act’ (article 28). 
46 In other respects, the Convention follows a long-established trad ition of the Hague 
Conference,20 by providing that States with more th an one system of law or which have 
autonomous territorial organizations , as well as Federal States, ar e free to appoint more than one 
                                                 
20 Compare, for example, article 18(3) of the Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of 
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters . Also, articles 24 and 25 of the 
Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-14  
 Central Authority. However, the problems encount ered in the practical application of those 
Conventions which provide for seve ral Central Authorities within th e territory of a single State, 
as well as, in particular, the sp ecial characteristics of the subj ect-matter of this Convention, led 
the Conference to adopt the text previously es tablished by the Special Commission and take a 
step towards creating a sort of ‘hierarchy’ of Central Authorities in those States. In fact, by 
confining our discussion to the latter point, we can see that if the pe rson responsible for the 
removal or retention of a child avails himself of the excellent means of communication within a 
particular State, the applicant or  Central Authority of the requestin g State could be forced to re-
apply several times in order to obtain the return of the child. Moreover, it is still possible that, 
even if there are valid reasons for believing that th e child is in a Contracti ng State, the territorial 
unit of the child’s resi dence will be ignored. 
47 The Convention supplies a solu tion to these and other situat ions by providing that States 
which establish more than one Central Authority should at the same time designate ‘the Central 
Authority to which applications may be addres sed for transmission to the appropriate Central 
Authority within that State’ (article 6). The matter is important, because the Convention imposes 
a time-limit upon the duty of judicial or administra tive authorities in the requested State for the 
prompt return of the child;21 a mistaken choice as to the requested Central Authority could 
therefore have decisive consequences  for the claims of the parties. Now, so as to prevent a factor 
which was not provided for in the Convention modifying the Convention’s normal application, 
this type of ‘supe r-Central Authority’ envi saged in article 6 will have to adopt a positive 
approach. As a matter of fact, if it is to act as a bridge between on the one hand the Central 
Authority of its own State which has jurisdiction in each particular case, and on the other hand 
the Central Authorities of the other Contracting States, it w ill find itself obliged to choose 
between proceeding to locate a child in order to  transmit the matter to the appropriate Central 
Authority, and transmitting a copy of the applicati on to all the Central Authorities of the State 
concerned, which would inevitably cause a great incr ease in administrative duties. However it is 
undoubtedly the case that such a Central Author ity will play a fundamental role in the 
application of the Convention in regard to relations affecting the aforementioned States. 
B The model form 
48 Following the decision taken by the Speci al Commission at it s second meeting, the 
Fourteenth Session. of the C onference adopted simultaneously  with its adoption of the 
Convention, a Recommendation co ntaining a model form for app lications for the return of 
children wrongfully removed or retained. Two comments are appropr iate here. The first concerns 
the legal force of this Recommenda tion. In drawing it up, it seemed advisable to have recourse to 
the general law governing internat ional organizations. Now, viewed from this perspective, a 
recommendation is in substance a non-obligator y invitation addressed by one international 
organization to one, several or al l Member States. Consequently, St ates are not strictly required 
to make use of the model form contained in the Recommendation; inde ed, the Commission took 
care to avoid presenting the form  as an annex to the Convention. 
The reasons for this are clear. Mo st importantly, given the lack of  prior international experience 
in this field, it can well be imagined that, after a number of years, the pract ical application of the 
                                                 
21 Cf infra , the commentary on article 12 of the Convention. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-15  
 Convention’s provisions will result in certain m odifications to the present form being thought 
advisable. Now, it seems better not to subject fu ture revisions of the text to the formalities 
required by public interna tional law for the revision of interna tional treaties. Besides, it could be 
said, in connection with any future concerted action by the Conference in this regard, that 
adaptation of the form which was recommended to  States should also be a matter for bilateral 
negotiations between Central Authorities, in implementation of their general obligation contained in article 7(2)(i). 
On the other hand, a direct conseq uence of the decision not to ma ke the use of the model form 
obligatory is the catalogue of details which every application to a Central Authority must contain 
(article 8). 
49 The second comment bears upon the sphere  of application a nd the terms of the 
recommended form. Although the Convention also governs important matters concerning access 
rights, the model form proposed is  merely a model application for the return of the child. This 
demonstrates the concentration of interest with in the Conference on th e resolution of problems 
arising out of the removal of a child, whilst at the same time thro wing into relief the novelty of 
the means chosen to resolve them. It is precis ely because the means are new that it was thought 
advisable to include some indication of the way in wh ich they should be used. 
50 The actual terms of the form narrate preci sely those points requi red by the Convention 
itself. We should however like to draw attenti on to two minor points. Firstly, the phrase ‘date 
and place of marriage’ of the parents of the child in  question: in as much as it is not followed, in 
parentheses, by the words ‘if any’, it would seem to treat natural children in an exceptional and 
discriminatory fashion. Moreover, the absence of the same phrase alongsid e the reference to the 
date and place of birth of the child compares badly with the precision shown by article 8 of the 
Convention which adds, referring to the date  of birth, the words ‘where available’. 
51 Secondly, there is an inconsistency between the French and English texts regarding the 
‘information concerning the person alleged to have removed or retained the child’. It would be 
advisable to follow the English text here, since it is more comprehensive, especially as regards 
its reference to the nationality of the allege d abductor, a fact which will sometimes prove 
decisive in efforts to locate the child. 
IV STRUCTURE AND TERMINOLOGY 
A The structure of the Convention 
52 Articles 1, 2, 3 and 5 define the Convention’s scope with regard to its subject-matter, by 
specifying its aims and the criteria by which the re moval or retention of a child can be regarded 
as wrongful. Article 4 concerns the persons to whom the Conven tion applies, while article 35 
determines its temporal application. Articles 6 a nd 7 are devoted to the creation of the Central 
Authorities and their duties. Arti cles 8, 27 and 28 are concerned with applications to Central 
Authorities and the documents which may accom pany or supplement an application to them. 
Articles 9 to 12, and 14 to 19, deal with the va rious means established for bringing about the 
return of a child, as well as the legal significance of a decree to that effect. Articles 13 and 20 NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-16  
 concern the exceptions to the general rule for th e return of the child. Article 21 lays down the 
specific duties which the States have taken upon themselves with regard to access rights. 
Articles 22 to 26 and 30 (like the aforementioned articles 27 and 28) deal with certain technical 
matters regarding proceedings and the costs which can result from applications submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Convention. Arti cles 29 and 36 reflect th e ‘non-exclusive’ view 
which prevailed during the preparation of the Convention in stating, on the one hand, that 
applications may be submitted directly by individuals  to the judicial or administrative authorities 
of the Contracting States, outwith the framework of the provisions of the Convention, and on the 
other hand that Contracting Stat es have the acknowledged right to derogate by agreement from 
the restrictions which th e present Convention allows to be im posed upon the return  of the child. 
Articles 31 to 34 refer to States with more th an one system of law and to the Convention’s 
relations with other conventions. Lastly, ar ticles 37 to 45 contain the Final Clauses. 
B Terminology used in the Convention 
53 Following a long-established tradition of th e Hague Conference, the Convention avoided 
defining its terms, with the exception of those in article 5 concerning custody and access rights, 
where it was absolutely necessary to establis h the scope of the Convention’s subject-matter. 
These will be examined in their context. At this point we wish merely to consider one aspect of 
the terminology used which in our opinion merits a brief comment. It has to do with lack of 
correspondence between the title of  the Convention and the terms used in the text. Whilst the 
former uses the phrase ‘international child abdu ction’, the provisions of the Convention avail 
themselves of circumlocutions or at any even t of less evocative turn s of phrase, such as 
‘removal’ or ‘retention’. The reason for this is  quite in keeping with the Convention’s limited 
scope. As was stressed above (see Nos 12 to 16), studies of the topic w ith which the Convention 
deals show clearly that, with regard both to the relationship which normally exists between 
‘abductor’ and ‘child’ and to the intentions of the former, we  are far removed from the offences 
associated with the terms ‘kidnapping’, ‘ enlevement ’ or ‘ secuestro ’. Since one is far removed 
from problems peculiar to the criminal law, the use in the text of th e Convention of possibly 
ambiguous terms was avoided. 
On the other hand, it was felt desirable to keep the term ‘a bduction’ in the title of the 
Convention, owing to its habitual  use by the ‘mass media’ and its resonance in the public mind. 
Nonetheless, so as to avoid any ambiguity, the same title, as in the Preliminary Draft, states clearly that the Convention only  aims to regulate the ‘civil aspects’ of this particular 
phenomenon. If, in the course of this Report, expressions such as ‘abduction’ or ‘abductor’ are 
used from time to time, and one will find them also in the model form, that is because they sometimes permit of easier drafting;  but at all events, they will have to be understood to contain 
nuances which their application to the specific problem with which the Convention deals may 
call for. 
Second Part — Commentary on the specific articles of the Convention 
CHAPTER 1 - SCOPE OF THE CONVENTION NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-17  
 54 The first chapter defines the scope of the C onvention as regards its subject-matter and the 
persons concerned (its scope ratione materiae  and ratione personae ). However, so as to have an 
overall picture of the Convention’s scope, one must  consider also article 34 which deals with the 
Convention’s relationship with other conventions , article 35 which concerns the Convention’s 
temporal application, and articles 31 to 33 which relate to the application of the Convention in 
States with more than one legal system. 
Article I — The aims of the Convention 
a  General observations 
55 This article sets out in two paragraphs  the objects of the C onvention which were 
discussed in broad terms in the first part of this  Report. It is therefore clear that the lack of 
correspondence between the title and the spec ific provisions of the Convention is more than 
merely a matter of terminology.22 In any event, it must be realized  that the terms used in the title, 
while lacking legal exactitude, possess an evocative pow er and force which attract attention, and 
this is essential. 
56 As for the nature of the matters regulated by the Convent ion, one general comment is 
required. Although the Convention does not contai n any provision which expressly states the 
international nature of the situat ions envisaged, such a conclusion derives as much from its title 
as from its various articles. Now, in the presen t case, the international nature of the Convention 
arises out of a factual situati on, that is to say the dispersal of members of a family among 
different countries. A situation which was purely inte rnal to start with can therefore come within 
the scope of the Convention thr ough, for example, one of the members of the family going 
abroad with the child, or through a desire to exercise access rights in  a country other than that in 
which the person who claims thos e rights lives. On the other ha nd, the fact that  the persons 
concerned hold different nationali ty does not necessarily mean that the international type of case 
to which the Convention applies automatically w ill arise, although it woul d clearly indicate the 
possibility of its becoming ‘inter national’ in the sense described. 
b Sub-paragraph a 
57 The aim of ensuring the prompt return of children wrongfully rem oved or retained has 
already been dealt with at leng th. Besides, the Fourteenth Sessi on in no way altered the literal 
meaning of the wording devised by the Special  Commission. Thus only two brief points by way 
of explanation will be put forward here. The first concerns the characterization of the behaviour which the realization of this objective seeks to prevent. To sum up, as we know, the conduct 
concerned is that which changes the family re lationships which existed before or after any 
judicial decision, by using a child a nd thus turning it into an inst rument and principal victim of 
the situation. In this context, the reference to children ‘wrongfully retained’ is meant to cover 
those cases where the child, with the consent of  the person who normall y has custody, is in a 
place other than its place of habitual residence and is not returned by the person with whom it 
was staying. This is the typical situation which comes about when the removal of the child results from the wrongful exercise of access rights. 
                                                
 
22 See the Report of the Special Commission, No 52. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-18  
 58 Secondly, the text states clearly  that the children whose return  it is sought to secure are 
those who have been removed to, or retained in , ‘any Contracting State’. This wording is doubly 
significant. On the one hand, th e provision in article 4 limits  the scope of the Convention ratione 
personae  to those children who, while be ing habitually resident in one of the Contracting States, 
are removed to or retained in, the te rritory of another Contracting State. 
59 But these same words also have a quite diferent meaning. In fact, through this 
formulation this particular object  of the Convention, whether consid ered in its ow n right or in 
relation to article 2, becomes indi rectly a general one, applicab le to all children who, in the 
circumstances set forth, are in any Contracting Stat e. However, there will always be a difference 
between the legal position of those children who, prior to their removal, were habitually resident 
in another Contracting State, and that of othe r children. The position of the former will have to 
be resolved by the direct appli cation of the provisions of the C onvention. On the other hand, the 
duty of States towards the other ch ildren is less clear (leaving aside provisions of internal law) in 
so far as it derives from the obligation stated in article 2, which could be described as a duty to 
take appropriate measures to prevent their terr itory being turned into a place of refuge for 
potential ‘abductors’. 
c Sub-paragraph b 
60 The aim of the Convention contained in this sub-paragraph was clarified in the course of 
drafting at the Fourteenth Session.23 So far as its scope is concerned, it is now clear that the 
situations under cons ideration are the same as those to whic h the Convention applies, that is to 
say international situations whic h involve two or more Contrac ting States. It should not be 
thought that precision in this matter is unnecessary, es pecially when one considers that the text of 
the Preliminary Draft allowed of other interpretati ons, and in particular a reference to internal 
situations. 
61 As for knowing the desired meaning of the ai m stated therein, it is necessary to draw a 
distinction between custody rights and access rights. With regard to custody rights, it can be said 
that the Convention has not attempted to deal with them separately. It is thus within the general 
obligation stated in article 2, and the regulatio n governing the return of the child — which is 
based, as we shall see in the commentary on ar ticle 3, upon respect for custody rights actually 
exercised and attributed under the law of the chil d’s habitual residence — that one must look in 
order to find the consequences of the provision  which concerns us here. On the other hand, 
access rights are treated more favourably, and the foundations upon which respect for their 
effective exercise seem fixed, at least in br oad outline, within the context of article 21. 
Article 2 — General obligati on of Contracting States 
62 Closely related to the objects stated in  broad and flexible fashion in article l b is the fact 
that this article sets forth a general duty incumbent upon Contracting States . It is t hus a duty 
which, unlike obligations to achieve a result wh ich are normally to be found in conventions, does 
not require that actual results be achieved but merely  the adoption of an attitude designed to lead 
to such results. In the present cas e, the attitude and behaviour requ ired of States is expressed in 
                                                 
23 Cf. Working Document No 2 (Proposal of the United Kingdom delegation) and P.-v. No 2. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-19  
 the requirement to ‘take all appropriate measur es to secure within their territories the 
implementation of the objects of the Conv ention’. The Convention also seeks, while 
safeguarding the ‘self-executing’ character of its other articles, to encour age Contracting States 
to draw inspiration from these rules in resolving problems similar to those with which the Convention deals, but which do not fall within its scope ratione personae  or ratione temporis. On 
the one hand, this should lead to careful examina tion of the Convention’s rules whenever a State 
contemplates changing its own internal laws on rights of custody or acce ss; on the other hand, 
extending the Convention’s objects  to cases which are not covere d by its own provi sions should 
influence courts and be shown in a decreasing use of the public policy exception when questions 
concerning international relations which are ou twith the scope of the Convention fall to be 
decided. 
63 Moreover, the last sentence of the article spec ified one of the partic ular means envisaged, 
while stressing also the importance placed by the Convention on the use of speedy procedures in 
matters of custody or access rights. However, this provision does not impose an obligation upon 
States to bring new procedures into their in ternal law, and the correspondence now existing 
between the French and English texts rightly se eks to avoid such an interpretation, which the 
original French text made possible. It is theref ore limited to requesting C ontracting States, in any 
question concerning the subjec t-matter of the Convention, to use the most expeditious 
procedures available in their own law. 
Article 3 — The unlawful nature of a removal or retention 
a General observations 
64 Article 3 as a whole constitutes one of the key provisions of the Convention, since the 
setting in motion of the Convention’s machiner y for the return of the child depends upon its 
application. In fact, the duty to re turn a child arises only if its re moval or retention is considered 
wrongful in terms of the Convention. Now, in laying down the conditions which have to be met for any unilateral change in the status quo to be  regarded as wrongful, this article indirectly 
brings into clear focus those relationships which the Convention seeks to protect. Those 
relationships are based upon the exis tence of two facts, firstly, th e existence of rights of custody 
attributed by the State of the ch ild’s habitual residence and, sec ondly, the actual exercise of such 
custody prior to the child’s removal. Let us exam ine more closely the import of these conditions. 
b  The juridical element 
65 As for what could be termed the juridical element present in these situations, the 
Convention is intended to defend th ose relationships which are alr eady protected, at any rate by 
virtue of an apparent right to custody in the State of the child’s habitual residence, i.e. by virtue 
of the law of the State where the child’s rela tionships developed prio r to its removal. The 
foregoing remark requires further explanation in tw o respects. The first poi nt to be considered 
concerns the law, a breach of which determines whether a removal or re tention is wrongful, in 
the Convention sense. As we have just said, this is a matter of custody rights. Although the 
problems which can arise from a breach of access rights, especially where the child is taken 
abroad by its custodian, were raised during the Fourteenth Session, the majority view was that 
such situations could not be put  in the same category as the wr ongful removals wh ich it is sought NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-20  
 to prevent.24 This example, and others like it wher e breach of access right s profoundly upsets the 
equilibrium established by a judi cial or administrati ve decision, certainl y demonstrate that 
decisions concerning the custody of children should always be open to review. This problem 
however defied all efforts of the Hague Confer ence to co-ordinate views thereon. A questionable 
result would have been attain ed had the applicati on of the Convention, by granting the same 
degree of protection to custody an d access rights, led ultimately to the substitution of the holders 
of one type of right by those who held the other. 
66 The second question which should be examined concerns the law which is chosen to 
govern the initial validity of the claim. We shall not dwell at this  point upon the notion of 
habitual residence, a well-established concept in the Hague Conference, which regards it as a question of pure fact, differing in that respect from  domicile. Moreover, the choice of the law of 
habitual residence as the factor which is to determine the lawfulness of the situation flouted by the abduction is logica l. In actual fact, to th e arguments in favour of its being accorded a pre-
eminent role in the protection of minors, as in  the Hague Convention of  1961, must be added the 
very nature of th e Convention itself, viz. its limited scope. In this regard, two points must be 
made: on the one hand, the Convent ion does not seek to  govern definitively questions concerning 
the custody of children, a fact which weaken s considerably those arguments favouring the 
application of national law; on the other hand, th e rules of the Convention rest largely upon the 
underlying idea that there exists a ty pe of jurisdiction which by its na ture belongs to the courts of 
a child’s habitual residence in cases involving its custody. 
From a different viewpoint, our attention should also be drawn to the fact that the Convention 
speaks of the ‘law’ of the State of habitual re sidence, thus breaking with a long-established 
tradition of Hague Conventions on a pplicable law since 1955, which re fer to a particular internal 
law to govern the matters with whic h they deal. Of course, in such cases, the word ‘law’ has to 
be understood in its widest se nse, as embracing both written and customary rules of law —
whatever their relative importance might be — and the interpretations placed upon them by case-
law. However, the adjective ‘internal’ implies the exclusion of all reference to the conflict of law 
rules of the particular legal sy stem. Therefore, since the Conven tion has abandoned its traditional 
formulation by speaking of ‘the law of the habitual  residence’, this differe nce cannot be regarded 
as just a matter of terminology. In fact, as th e preliminary proceedings  of the Commission 
demonstrate,
25 it was intended right from the start to e xpand considerably the range of provisions 
which have to be considered in this cont ext. Actually, a proposal  was made during the 
Fourteenth Session that this artic le should make it clear that the reference to the law of the 
habitual residence extends also to the rules of private international law. The fact that this 
proposal was rejected was due to the Conference’ s view that its inclusion was unnecessary and 
became implicit anyway once the text neither di rectly nor indirectly excluded the rules in 
question.26 
67 The foregoing considerations show that the law of the child’s habitual residence is 
invoked in the widest possible se nse. Likewise, the sources from  which the custody rights which 
                                                 
24 Cf. Working Document No 5 (Proposal of the. Canadian delegation) and P.-v. No 3. 
25 Cf the Special Commission Report, No 62, supra , p. 90. 
26 Cf. Working Document No 2 (Proposal of the United Kingdom delegation), and P.-v. No 2. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-21  
 it is sought to protect derive, ar e all those upon which a claim can be  based within the context of 
the legal system concerned. In this regard, paragr aph 2 of article 3 takes into consideration some 
— no doubt the most important — of those sour ces, while emphasizing that the list is not 
exhaustive. This paragraph provides that ‘the  rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph a 
above may arise in particular’, th us underlining the fact that othe r sorts of rights may exist which 
are not contained within the text itself. Now, as  we shall see in the following paragraphs, these 
sources cover a vast juridical area, and the fact that they are not exhaustively set out must be 
understood as favouring a flexible interpretation of the terms use d, which allows the greatest 
possible number of cases to be  brought into consideration. 
68 The first source referred to in article 3 is law,  where it is stated that custody ‘may arise . . 
. by operation of law’. That leads us to stress one of the char acteristics of this Convention, 
namely its application to the protection of cu stody rights which were ex ercised prior to any 
decision thereon. This is importa nt, since one cannot forget that , in terms of statistics, the 
number of cases in which a child  is removed prior to a decision on its custody are quite frequent. 
Moreover, the possibility of the dispossessed pare nt being able to recover the child in such 
circumstances, except within the Convention’s fr amework, is practically non-existent, unless he 
in his turn resorts to force, a course of action which is always  harmful to the child. In this 
respect, by including such cases within its scope, the Conventi on has taken a significant step 
towards resolving the real problems which in the past largely escaped the control of the 
traditional mechanisms of private international law. 
As for knowing the legal system which, according to  the Convention, is to attribute the custody 
rights, which it is desired to prot ect, it is necessary to go back to the considerations developed in 
the previous paragraph. Thus, custody ex lege  can be based either on the internal law of the State 
of the child’s habitual residence, or on the law de signated by the conflict ru les of that State. The 
scope of the first option is quite clear; the seco nd implies, for example, that the removal by its 
French father of a child born out  of wedlock which had its habitu al residence in Spain where it 
lived with its mother, both mother  and child being of French na tionality, should be considered 
wrongful in the Convention sense,  by means of the application of French law designated as 
applicable by the Spanish conflict rule on questi ons of custody, quite independently of the fact 
that application of internal Spanish law w ould probably have led to  a different result. 
69 The second source of custody rights contained in article 3 is a judicial or administrative 
decision. Since the Convention does not expand upon this, it must be deemed, on the one hand, 
that the word ‘decision’ is used in its widest  sense, and embraces any decision or part of a 
decision (judicial or administ rative) on a child’s custody and, on the other hand, that these 
decisions may have been issued by the courts of the State of the child’s habitual residence as well as by the courts of a third country.
27 Now, in the latter case, that is to say when custody 
rights were exercised in the State of the child’s  habitual residence on the basis of a foreign 
decree, the Convention does not require that the decree had been formally recognized. 
Consequently, in order to have th e effect described, it is sufficien t that the decision be regarded 
as such by the State of  habitual residence, i.e. that it contain in principle certain minimum 
characteristics which are necessary for setting in motion the means by which it may be 
                                                 
27 This interpretation is based upon the deliberations of the Special Commission which led to its adopting 
a similar text to the current one See Report of the Special Commission, No 64, supra . pp. 191-192. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-22  
 confirmed or recognized.28 This wide interpretation is more over confirmed by the whole tenor of 
article 14. 
70 Lastly, custody rights may arise according to article 3, ‘by reason of  an agreement having 
legal effect under the law of that State’. In principle, the agreem ents in question may be simple 
private transactions between the parties concerni ng the custody of their children. The condition 
that they have ‘legal effect’ acco rding to the law of the State of habitual residence was inserted 
during the Fourteenth Session in place of a requireme nt that it have the ‘force of law’, as stated 
in the Preliminary Draft. The change was made  in response to a desi re that the conditions 
imposed upon the acceptance of agreements govern ing matters of custody which the Convention 
seeks to protect should be made as clear and as flexible as possible. As regards the definition of 
an agreement which has ‘legal effect’ in terms of  a particular law, it seems that there must be 
included within it any sort of agreement which is not prohibited by such a law and which may 
provide a basis for presenting a le gal claim to the competent author ities. Now, to go back to the 
wide interpretation given by article 3 to the notion of ‘the  law of the State of the child’s habitual 
residence’, the law concerned can equally as well be the internal law of that State as the law 
which is indicated as applicable by its conflict rules. It is for the authorities of the State 
concerned to choose between the two alternatives , although the spirit of the Convention appears 
to point to the choice of the one which, in each particular case, would recognize that custody had 
actually been exercised. On the other hand, the C onvention does not state, in substance or form, 
the conditions which these agreements must fulfil , since these will change  according to the terms 
of the law concerned. 
71 Leaving aside a consideration of those pe rsons who can hold rights of custody, until the 
commentary on article 4 which concer ns the scope of the Convention ratione personae , it should 
be stressed now that the intention is to protect  all the ways in which custody of children can be 
exercised. Actually, in terms of article 3, custo dy rights may have been awarded to the person 
who demands that their exercise be respected, and to that person in his own right or jointly. It 
cannot be otherwise in an era when types of join t custody, regarded as be st suited to the general 
principle of sexual non-discrimination, are gradua lly being introduced into internal law. Joint 
custody is, moreover, not always custody ex lege , in as much as courts are increasingly showing 
themselves to be in favour, where circumstances permit, of dividing the responsibilities inherent 
in custody rights between both parents. Now, from  the Convention’s standpoint, the removal of a 
child by one of the joint holders without the cons ent of the other, is equally wrongful, and this 
wrongfulness derives in this particular case, not fr om some action in breach of a particular law, 
but from the fact that such action has disregarde d the rights of the other parent which are also 
protected by law, and has interf ered with their normal exercise. The Convention’s true nature is 
revealed most clearly in these situations: it is not concerned with establishing the person to 
whom custody of the child will belong at some poi nt in the future, nor w ith the situ ations in 
which it may prove necessary to modify a decision awarding joint custody on the basis of facts which have subsequently changed. It seeks, more simply, to prevent a later decision on the matter being influenced by a change of circum stances brought about th rough unilateral action by 
one of the parties. 
                                                
 
28 See Working Document No 58, ‘ Document de clarification presente  par la delegation italienne,’ for 
the desirability of including such a case in the Convention. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-23  
 c The factual element 
72 The second element characterizing those relati onships protected by the Convention is that 
the custody rights which it is claimed have been breached by the child’s removal were actually 
exercised by the holder. In fact , as soon as an approach to th e subject-matter of the Convention 
was adopted which deviated from the pure and si mple international recognition of custody rights 
attributed to parents, the Conven tion put its emphasis on protecting the right of children to have 
the stability which is so vital to  them respected. In other words, the Convention protects the right 
of children not to have the emo tional, social etc. aspects of their lives altered, unless legal 
arguments exist which would guarantee their stab ility in a new situation. This approach is 
reflected in the scope of the C onvention, which is limited to cust ody rights actually exercised. 
What is more, such a notion is justified within the framework of international relations by a complementary argument which concerns the fact  that contradictory decisions arise quite 
frequently in this particular context, decisions which are basically of little use in protecting the stability of a child’s life. 
73 Actually, this idea was not opposed to any extent. However, several proposals
29 were put 
forward for the deletion from artic le 3 of any reference to the act ual exercise of custody rights. 
The reason for this was that its retention c ould place on the applicant the burden of proving a 
point which would sometimes be difficult to establish. The situation became even more 
complicated when account was taken of the fact  that article 13, which concerns the possible 
exceptions to the obligation to or der the return of the child, requi res the ‘abductor’ this time to 
prove that the dispossessed party had not actua lly exercised the custody rights he now claims. 
Now, it is indeed by considering both provisions toge ther that the true nature of the condition set 
forth in article 3 can be seen clearly. This condition, by defining the scope of the Convention, 
requires that the applicant provide only some pr eliminary evidence that he actually took physical 
care of the child, a fact which normally will be relatively easy to demonstrate. Besides, the informal nature of this requirement is highlighted in article 8 which simply includes, in sub-
paragraph c, ‘the grounds on which the applican t’s claim for return of the child is based’, 
amongst the facts which it requires  to be contained in applications to the Central Authorities. 
On the other hand, article 13 of the Convention (12 in the Preliminary Draft) shows us the real 
extent of the burden of proof placed upon the ‘abducto r’: it is for him to show, if he wishes to 
prevent the return of the child, that the guardian had not actually exercised his righ ts of custody. 
Thus, we may conclude that the Convention, taken as a whole, is built upon the tacit presumption 
that the person who has car e of the child actually exercises cu stody over it. This idea has to be 
overcome by discharging the burden of proof wh ich has shifted, as is normal with any 
presumption ( i.e. discharged by the ‘abductor’ if he wishes  to prevent the retu rn of the child). 
74 However, there is expressly included amongst the matters which the Convention is 
intended to protect the situation which arises when actual custody cannot be exercised precisely 
because of the removal of the child;  that is the situation envisaged in  the last alternative set out in 
article 3 b. Theoretically, the underlying idea is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the 
Convention, and it is therefore from a practical point of view that it may be wondered whether 
                                                
 
29 Working Documents Nos 1 (Proposal of the United States delegation) and 10 (Proposal of the Finnish 
delegation), and also P.-v. No 3. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-24  
 such a provision needed to be added.30 From this viewpoint, the hypo thetical situations which 
this provision is designed to prot ect are of two types, one of whic h falls clearly within the scope 
of the Convention, while the other, failing this rule, would probably require too strained an 
interpretation of its provisions. On the one ha nd, there are cases where an initial decision on 
custody is rendered worthless by the removal of the child. In so far as such a description follows 
the disruption of normal family life after a reasonab le lapse of time, the ho lder of the rights could 
be regarded as having exercised them from the out set, so that the situation described fulfils all 
the conditions laid down within the scope of th e Convention. However, if a decision on custody 
by the courts of the child’s habi tual residence is considered, wh ich modifies a prior decision and 
cannot be enforced because of the action of the a bductor, it could be that the new holder of the 
right to custody has not exercised it within the extended time-limit. The difficulties which would 
be encountered in seeking to apply the Convention to such situations and perhaps to others not 
herein mentioned, are obvious. To conclude, alt hough this provision must not be expected to 
come into play very often, it has to be said fi nally that its inclusion in the Convention might 
prove to be useful. 
Article 4 — Convention’s scope ratione personae 
75 This article concerns only the Convention’s scope ratione personae  as regards the 
children who are to be protected. However, for the sake of completeness, we shall also deal with 
the other aspects of the problem in  their proper context, that is to say those potential holders of 
custody and access rights and those who could be regarded as ‘abductors’, within the terms of the Convention. 
a The children protected 
76 The Convention applies to children of le ss than sixteen years of age, who were 
‘habitually resident in a Contr acting State immediately before any breach of custody or access 
rights’. As regards the requirement that they be ha bitually resident, refere nce must again be made 
to those considerations previously expressed ab out the nature of the C onvention, which lead to 
the conclusion that a convention based on co-ope ration among authorities can  only become fully 
operational after the relationships  envisaged come into existen ce as among Contracting States. 
77 The age limit for application of the Conven tion raises two important questions. Firstly, 
the matter of age in the strict se nse gave rise to virtually no dis pute. The Convention kept the age 
at sixteen, and therefore held to a concept of ‘t he child’ which is more restrictive than that 
accepted by other Hague Conventions.
31 The reason for this derives from the objects of the 
Convention themselves; indeed, a person of more than sixteen years of age generally has a mind 
                                                 
30 Cf. Working Document No 2 (Proposal of the United Kingdom delegation) and th e debate on this point 
in P.-v. Nos 3 and 13. 
31 For example: Convention of 24 October 1956 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations in 
Respect of Children (article 1); Convention of 15 April 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of 
Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations in Respect of Children (article I) ; Convention of 5 
October 1961 Concerning the Powers of Authorities and the Law Applicable in Respect of the Protection 
of Minors (article 12) ; Convention of 15 November 1965 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and 
Recognition of Decisions Relating to Adoptions  (article 1). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-25  
 of his own which cannot easily  be ignored either by one  or both of his parents,  or by a judicial or 
administrative authority. 
As for deciding upon the point at which this ag e should exclude the C onvention’s application, 
the most restrictive of the various options  available was retained by the Convention. 
Consequently, no action or decision based upon th e Convention’s provisions can be taken with 
regard to a child afte r its sixteenth birthday. 
78 The second problem deals with the situati on of children under sixteen years of age who 
have the right to choose their own place of residen ce. Considering that this right to choose one’s 
residence generally forms part of the right to custody, a proposal was put forward to the effect 
that the Convention should not apply in such cases.32 However, this propos al was rejected on 
various grounds, inter alia  the following: (1) the difficulty of choosing the legal system which 
should determine whether such a possibility exists , since there are at leas t three different laws 
which could be applicable, namely, national law, th e law of habitual residence prior to the child’s 
removal, and the law of the State of refuge; (2 ) the excessive restricti on which this proposal 
would place upon the scope of the Convention, particularly with re gard to access rights; (3) the 
fact that the right to decide a child’s place of residence is only one possible element of the right 
to custody which does not itself deprive it of all content. On the other hand, the decision taken in 
this regard cannot be isolated from the provision in  article 13, second paragraph, which allows 
the competent authorities to have regard to the opinion of the child as to its return, once it has 
reached an appropriate age and degr ee of maturity. Indeed, this rule leaves it open to judicial or 
administrative authorities, whenever they are faced with the possibility of returning a minor legally entitled to decide on his place of residence,  to take the view that the opinion of the child 
should always be the decisive factor. The point  could therefore be reached where an optional 
provision of the Convention be comes automatically applicable, but such a result seems 
preferable to an overall reduc tion in the Convention’s scope. 
b The holders of custody and access rights 
79 The problems raised by both of these rights in  this regard are quite  different. Firstly, as 
regards access rights, it is obvious, by  the very nature of things, that  they will alwa ys be held by 
individuals, whose identity will depend on the law which applies to the organizing of these rights. These persons will as a rule be close relati ves of the child, and norma lly will be either its 
father or mother. 
80 On the other hand, legal persons can also, in terms of the Conve ntion, hold rights of 
custody. Article 3 envisages the possibility of cust ody rights being attributed to ‘an institution or 
any other body’, and is expressed in deliberatel y vague and wide terms. In fact, during the 
Fourteenth Session, the inclusion w ithin the scope of the Conventio n of situations in which the 
child is entrusted to an instit ution was not challenged. Now, si nce there are bodies other than 
institutions which have children in  their care, the term used was extended so as to  apply equally 
to those bodies with legal personality and to those which, as an arm of the State, lack separate personality. 
                                                
 
32 Cf. Working Document No 4 (Proposition de la delegation beige) and P.-v. No 4. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-26  
 c  The potential ‘abductors’ 
81 The Convention contains no express prov ision on this matter. Nevertheless, two 
comments may be drawn from the text as a whole, which shed light upon this  question in relation 
to the Convention’s scope ratione personae . The first concerns the physical persons who may be 
responsible for the removal or re tention of a child. On this, th e Convention upholds the point of 
view adopted by the Special Commi ssion by not attributi ng such acts exclusiv ely to one of the 
parents.33 Since the idea of ‘family’ was more or le ss wide, depending on the different cultural 
conceptions which surround it, it wa s felt better to hold a wide view which would, for example, 
allow removals by a grandfather or adoptive fath er to be characterized  as child abduction, in 
accordance with the Convention’s use of that term. 
82 The second comment relates to the possibility of an ‘institution or any other body’ acting 
as an ‘abductor’. In this regard, it is diffi cult to imagine how any body whatever could remove, 
either by force or by deception, a child from a foreign country to its ow n land. On the other hand, 
if a child were entrusted, by virtue of a judicial or administrative decision ( i.e. compulsory 
placement of the child) to such a body in the count ry of its habitual residence, the parent who 
sought to obtain the actu al enjoyment of custody ri ghts would stand little ch ance of being able to 
invoke the provisions of the Convent ion. In fact, by virtue of the f act that such bodies would as a 
rule exercise jurisdiction, except as regards the possible recognition of parental authority,34 such 
a claim would not come within the scope of  the Convention, since custody, in the sense 
understood by the Convention, would belong to the body in question. 
Article 5 — Certain terms used in the Convention 
83 The Convention, following a long-established tradition of the Hague Conference, does 
not define the legal concepts used by it. However,  in this article, it does make clear the sense in 
which the notions of custody and access rights are us ed, since an incorrect interpretation of their 
meaning would risk compromi sing the Convention’s objects. 
84 As regards custody rights, the Convention mere ly emphasizes the fact that it includes in 
the term ‘rights relating to the care of the person of  the child’, leaving aside the possible ways of 
protecting the child’s prope rty. It is therefore a more limited c oncept than that of ‘protection of 
minors’,35 despite attempts made during the Fourteenth Session to introduce the idea of 
‘protection’ so as to include in  particular those cases where child ren are entrusted to institutions 
or bodies. But since all efforts to define custody rights in regard to those particular situations 
failed, one has to rest content with the general description given above. The Convention seeks to 
be more precise by emphasizing, as an example of  the ‘care’ referred to, the right to determine 
                                                 
33 A more restrictive approach was to be found initia lly in the Dyer Report, referred to above, entitled 
Report on international child abduction by one parent . 
34 See the Judgment of the International Court of  Justice, dated 28 November 1958, on the case 
concerning the application of the Convention of 1902 for regulating the guardianship of minors, ICJ 
Reports  1958, p. 55 et seq . 
35 See, for example, the Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the 
applicable law in respect of the protection of minors . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-27  
 the child’s place of residence. However, if the child, although still a minor  at law, has the right 
itself to determine its own place of residence, the substance of the custody rights will have to be determined in the context of other righ ts concerning the person of the child. 
On the other hand, although nothing is said in this ar ticle about the possibi lity of custody rights 
being exercised singly or jointly, such a possibility is cl early envisaged. In f act, a classic rule of 
treaty law requires that a treaty’s terms be inte rpreted in their context and by taking into account 
the objective and end sought by the treaty,
36 and the whole tenor of article 3 leaves no room for 
doubt that the Convention seeks to protect join t custody as well. As for knowing when joint 
custody exists, that is  a question which must be decided in each particular  case, and in the light 
of the law of the child’s habitual residence. 
85 As regards access rights, sub-paragraph b of this article merely  points out that they 
include ‘the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child’s 
habitual residence’. Clearly, therefore, it is not intended that the Conve ntion exclude all other 
ways of exercising access rights. Quite simply, it seeks to emphasize that access rights extend 
also to what is called ‘resident ial access’, that aspect of access rights about which the person who 
has custody of the child is  particularly apprehensi ve. Moreover, since this  explanatory provision 
in no way qualifies this ‘other place’ to which the child may be taken, one must conclude that 
access rights, in terms of the Convention, al so include the right of access across national 
frontiers. 
86 A proposal was made to include in this article a definition of the judicial or 
administrative authorities mentioned throughout the Convention’s rules.37 The difficulties 
encountered as much in reaching a systematic vi ewpoint on this as in devising a definition wide 
enough to encompass all possible contingencies ma de for its exclusion. Now, as was mentioned 
earlier,38 it is clear that these are the authorities who ha ve the power, according to the internal 
law of each Contracting State, to determine que stions concerning a child’s custody or protection. 
Besides, it is precisely because of differences amongst these laws that reference is always made 
to ‘judicial or administrative’ authorities, so as to embrace all authorities which have jurisdiction 
in the matter, without regard to thei r legal characterization in each State. 
CHAPTER II - CENTRAL AUTHORITIES 
Article 6 — Creation of Central Authorities 
87 The role played by the Central Authorities, cruc ial factors as they are in the application of 
the Convention, has already been dealt with at length.39 As for those States  which may appoint 
more than one Central Authority, the idea which prevailed was that the de termining factor should 
be the existence of several terr itorial organizations for the protection of minors. Thus there was 
                                                 
36 See article 31(1) of the Vienna Conventi on of 23 May 1969 on the law of treaties. 
37 See Working Document No 7 (Proposal of the United States delegation) and P.-v. Nos 4 and 14. 
38 See supra , No 45. 
39 See supra , Nos 43 to 48. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-28  
 added to those cases of Federal States and States w ith more than one system of law that of States 
‘having autonomous territorial organizations’, a term which is to be interpreted broadly. 
Article 7 — Obligations of Central Authorities 
88 This article summarizes the role played by Ce ntral Authorities in bringing into play the 
system established by the Convention. The article is  structured in two paragraphs, the first of 
which, drafted in general terms, sets out an overa ll duty of co-operation, while the second lists, 
from sub-paragraphs a to i, some of the principal functions wh ich the Central Authorities have to 
discharge. Both result from a compromise be tween, on the one hand, t hose delegations which 
wanted strong Central Authoritie s with wide-ranging powers of action and initiative, and on the 
other hand those which saw these Authorities as straightforward administrative mechanisms for 
promoting action by the parties. Now, since these diverse attitudes reflected most of the deep 
differences which existed amongst the systems re presented at the Conf erence, the ultimate 
solution had to be flexible, and such as would allow each Central Authority to act according to 
the law within which it has to operate. Therefor e, although the Conventi on clearly sets out the 
principal obligations laid upon the Central Authorities, it lets each Contra cting State decide upon 
the appropriate means for discharging them. And it is  in this sense that th e sentence occurring at 
the beginning of the second paragraph must be understood, which states that the Central 
Authorities are to discharge their listed functions ‘either directly, or through any intermediary’. It 
is for each Central Authority to choose one or the other options, while working within the 
context of its own internal law and within the sp irit of the general duty of co-operation imposed 
upon it by the first paragraph. 
89 As we have just said, the rule in the first paragraph  sets out the general duty of Central 
Authorities to co-operate, so as to ensure  the Convention’s objects are achieved. Such co-
operation has to develop on two levels: the Central Authorities must firstly co-operate with each 
other; however, in addition, they must promote co-operation among the aut horities competent for 
the matters dealt with within their respective States. Whether this co-operation is promoted 
effectively will depend to a larg e extent on the freedom of action which each internal law confers 
upon the Central Authorities. 
90 The functions listed in the second paragraph  seek to trace, in broad outline, the different 
stages of intervention by Central Authorities in the typical case of child removal. Nonetheless, it 
is clear that this list is not e xhaustive. For example, since the intervention of Central Authorities 
necessarily depends on their having  been initially seized of the matter, either directly by the 
applicant or by the Central Authority of a Contrac ting State, then in the latter case the Central 
Authority initially seized will have to send the app lication to the Central Authority of the State in 
which the child is thought to be. Now, this obliga tion is not spelled out in article 7, but later, in 
the context of article 9. On the other hand, it is  also clear that the Central Authorities are not 
obliged to fulfil, in every specific case, all the duties listed in this article. In fact, the 
circumstances of each particular case will dictate the steps which are to be taken by the Central 
Authorities; for example, it cannot be maintained  that every Central Authority must discover the 
whereabouts of a child when the ap plicant knows full well where it is. 
91 In addition to finding the whereabouts of  the child, where necessary (sub-paragraph a), 
the Central Authority must take or cause to be taken any provisional measures which could help NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-29  
 prevent ‘further harm to the child or prej udice to interested pa rties’ (sub-paragraph b). The 
drafting of this sub-paragraph cl early brings out once again a f act which was emphasized above, 
namely, that the ability of Central Authorities to act will vary from one State to another. 
Basically, the provisional measur es envisaged are designed in particular to avoid another 
removal of the child. 
92 Sub-paragraph c sets out the duty of Central Authori ties to try to find an extrajudicial 
solution. In actual fact, in the light of experien ce as spoken to by some delegates, a considerable 
number of cases can be settled without any need to  have recourse to the courts. But, once again, 
it is the Central Authorities which, in those stages preceding the possible judicial or 
administrative proceedings, will dir ect the development of the problem;  it is therefore for them to 
decide when the attempts to secure the ‘volunta ry return’ of the child or to bring about an 
‘amicable resolution’, have failed. 
93 Sub-paragraph d relates to the exchange of information about the social background of 
the child. This duty is made subj ect to the criteria a dopted by the Central Au thorities involved in 
a particular case. Indeed, the inse rtion of the phrase ‘w here desirable’ demonstrates that there is 
no wish to impose an inflexible obligation here: the possibility of there being no information to 
provide, as well as the fear that reference to th is provision might be used by the parties as a 
delaying tactic, are some of the arguments whic h prompted this approach. On the other hand, a 
proposal which would have made the transmi ssion of certain information conditional upon its 
remaining confidential, was rejected.40 
94 The obligation laid upon Centra l Authorities to provide information on the content of the 
law in their own States for the application of the Convention appe ars in sub-paragraph e. This 
duty applies in particular to two situations. Firstly, where the removal occurs prior to any 
decision as to the custody of the child, the Centra l Authority of the State of the child’s habitual 
residence is to produce, for th e purposes of the Convention’s ap plication, a cert ificate on the 
relevant law of that State. S econdly, the Central Authority must  inform the individuals about 
how the Convention works and about the Central Authorities, as well as about the procedures 
available. On the other hand, the possibility of going further, by obliging the Central Authorities 
to give legal advice in individual cas es, is not envisaged by this rule. 
95 When it is necessary, in order to obtain the child’s return, for the judicial or 
administrative authorities of the State in which it  is located to intervene, the Central Authority 
must itself initiate proceedings (if that can be done under its inte rnal law) or facilitate the 
institution of proceedings. This duty also extends to proceedings which prove to be necessary for 
organizing or securing the effective exer cise of rights of access (sub-paragraph f). 
96 Where the Central Authority is not able to apply directly to  the competent authorities in 
its own State, it must provide or facilitate the pr ovision of legal aid and a dvice for the applicant, 
in terms of article 25 (sub-paragraph g). It is appropriate to point out here very briefly that the 
phrase ‘where the circumstances so require’ in this sub-paragraph refe rs to the applicant’s lack of 
economic resources, as determined by the criteri a laid down by the law of the State in which 
                                                 
40 See Working Document No 9 (Proposal of the United Kingdom delegation) and P.-v. No 5. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-30  
 such assistance is sought, and that it does not theref ore refer to abstract c onsiderations as to the 
convenience or otherwise of granting legal aid. 
97 Following the method adopted by this paragraph, sub-paragraph h includes among the 
Central Authorities’ obligations the bringing in to play in each case of such administrative 
arrangements as may be necessa ry and appropriate to secure the safe return of the child. 
98 Finally, sub-paragraph i sets forth an obligation on the pa rt of Central Authorities which 
does not directly concern individua ls but only the Convention itself.  It is the duty ‘to keep each 
other informed with respect to  the operation of the Conventi on, and, as far as possible, to 
eliminate any obstacles to its application’. This  obligation is to opera te on two complementary 
levels, firstly at the leve l of bilateral relations between States  which are Party to the Convention, 
and secondly on a multilateral level, through par ticipating when required  in commissions called 
for this purpose by the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference. 
CHAPTER III - RETURN OF THE CHILD 
Article 8 — Applications to Central Authorities 
99 In terms of the first paragraph , an application for the return of a child can be addressed to 
any Central Authority which, from that point, w ill be bound by all the obligations laid down by 
the Convention. This demonstrates that the appli cant is free to apply to the Central Authority 
which in his opinion is the most appropriate. Ho wever, for reasons of efficiency, the Central 
Authority of the child’s habitual residence is expr essly mentioned in the text, but this must not be 
understood as signifying that applica tions directed to other Central Authorities are to be regarded 
as exceptional. 
100 Since use of the model form is merely recommended, it was necessary to include in the 
text of the Convention the elements which any a pplication submitted to a Central Authority must 
contain in order to be admissibl e, as well as the optional do cuments which may accompany or 
supplement such an application. The elements wh ich every application to a Central Authority 
must contain, in this context, are those listed in the second paragraph  of article 8. In particular, 
they are facts which allow the child and interested parties to be identified, such as those which 
may be able to help in locating the child (sub-paragraphs a, b, and d). As regards information on 
the child’s date of birth, the Convention makes it clear that this should be supplied only ‘where 
available’. This provision is inte nded to favour action by an applic ant who is ignorant of such a 
fact but who will, however, always have to supp ly precise information on the age of the child, 
since the provisions of article 4 ma y result in his application bei ng rejected, in terms of article 
27. 
Moreover, the application must c ontain ‘the grounds on which the ap plicant’s claim for return of 
the child is based’ (sub-paragraph c). This requirement is logical, in that it allows the application 
of article 27 concerning the right of Central Authorities to re ject applications which are clearly 
not well-founded. The grounds must in principle re fer to the two elements , legal and factual, 
contained in article 3. Now, since the legal elem ent in particular may depend on the provisions of 
the law of the child’s habitual residence, or upon a decision or agreement, it might have been expected that documentary suppo rt would be required at this initial stage. However, the NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-31  
 Convention chose to follow a different route and placed this evidence amongst those documents 
which may, optionally, accompany or supplement the application. The reason for this is that 
obtaining the documents in question is sometimes  difficult and, what is more, could take up 
precious time better spent in speedily discov ering the whereabouts of the child. Moreover, 
whenever a Central Authority suc ceeds in bringing about  the voluntary return of the child or an 
amicable resolution of the affair, such requirements may seem merely accessory. 
101 Understood thus, the first two sub-paragraphs of the third paragraph , dealing with the 
optional provision of documents which may accom pany or supplement applic ations, are seen to 
refer to documents which are fundamental to a cl aim for the return of the child. It must be 
emphasized firstly that the requirement that copies  of any decision or agreement be authenticated 
in no way contradicts the provision in article 23 that ‘no legalizati on or similar formality may be 
required in the context of this Convention’. It  is simply a matter of verifying what were 
originally copies or private documents so as to guarantee that they co rrespond to the originals 
and thus to secure their free circulation. 
Secondly, proof of the substantive law of the St ate of the child’s habitual residence may be 
established by either certificates or affidavits, that is to say documents which include solemn statements for which those who make them assu me responsibility. As regards those persons who 
may adduce such statements, the Convention chose to define them widely, a fact which must 
make the task of the app licant easier (sub-paragraph f). Thus, they may emanate from any 
qualified person — for example, an attorney, solicitor, or barrister or research institution — as 
well as from the Central Authorities and the ot her competent authorities of the State of the 
child’s habitual residence. 
On the other hand, it should be stressed that at a la ter stage, when the judi cial or administrative 
authorities of the State of refuge have been call ed upon to intervene, they may, in terms of article 
15, request the production of certain  documents which were consider ed to be optional at the time 
of application to the Central Authorities. 
Lastly, the Convention acknowledges that the application may be accompanied or supplemented 
by ‘any other relevant doc ument’ (sub-paragraph g). In theory, since it is the dispossessed 
guardian of the child who brings the application, it is for him to provide these supplementary 
documents. This does not preclude the Central Aut hority to which the application was originally 
made, where the application is sent to a nother Central Authority, from accompanying the 
application by, inter alia , information concerning the social background of the child (if it has 
such information at its disposal a nd considers it to be useful), by virtue of the task laid upon it by 
article 7, paragraph 2d. 
Article 9 — Transmission of the application to the Central Authority of the State where the child 
is located 
102 A direct consequence of the applicant’s right to apply to the Central Authority of his 
choice is the duty imposed on the latter to transmit the application to the Central Authority of the 
State in which it has reason to believe the child is located; this duty arises also when the Central 
Authority which is informed of a case by anothe r Central Authority reaches the conclusion that 
the child is in fact located in a different countr y. This is a task which supplements the framework NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-32  
 of duties outlined in article 7, si nce it relates directly to the duty of co-operation amongst Central 
Authorities established by the first paragraph of that article. 
Now, although the meaning of article  9 may be clear, -it has not b een very artfully drafted. The 
‘requesting Central Authority’ to which this arti cle refers exists only where the application 
submitted in accordance with artic le 8 has been transmitted to another  Central Authority in terms 
of article 9 itself. Consequently, the duty to in form a ‘requesting Central Authority’ exists only 
when the application has been transmitted to a third Central Authority, the child not being located in the State of the second Central Authority  to which the application was sent. But on the 
other hand, the duty to transmit an applicati on in terms of this article devolves upon any Central 
Authority, independently of the fact that it was se ized of the matter either directly or through the 
intervention of another Central Authority, since this provision must be understood as applying to 
both of the cases it is meant to cover. 
Article 10 — Voluntary return of the child 
103 The duty of Central Authorities, stated in arti cle 7(2)(c), to ‘take a ll appropriate measures 
to secure the voluntary return of the child’, is gi ven preferential treatment in this article, which 
highlights the interest of the Convention in seeing parties have  recourse to this way of 
proceeding. The phrase ‘before the institution of any legal or administrative proceedings’ which 
preceded this provision in the Preliminary Draft, a nd restricted the duty in cluded within it to a 
particular point in time, was deleted from the te xt of the Convention. The reason for this deletion 
is the difficulty experienced by some legal system s in accepting that a public authority, such as a 
Central Authority, could act before an applic ation had been brought before the competent 
authorities; however, the whole teno r of the provision shows that th e Central Authorities of other 
States are not precluded from acting in that way. On the other hand, it is in no way an inflexible 
obligation, for two reasons: firstly, efforts to secu re the voluntary return of the child which were 
begun prior to the referral of the matter to the judicial or administrative authorities may be 
pursued thereafter, and secondly, in so far as the in itiative for the return of  the child has not been 
transferred to those authorities, it is for the Cent ral Authority to decide whether the attempts to 
achieve this objective have failed. 
Moreover, the measures envisaged in this articl e are not intended to prejudice the efforts of 
Central Authorities to prevent further removals of the child, pursuant to article 7(2)(b). 
Article 11 — The use of expeditious procedures  by judicial or administrative authorities 
104 The importance throughout the Convention of the time factor appears again in this article. 
Whereas article 2 of the Convention imposes upon Contracting States the duty to use expeditious 
procedures, the first paragraph  of this article restates the oblig ation, this time with  regard to the 
authorities of the State to which the child has be en taken and which are to  decide upon its return. 
There is a double aspect to this duty: firstly, the use of the most speedy procedures known to 
their legal system; secondly, that applications are, so far as possible, to be granted priority 
treatment. 
105 The second paragraph , so as to prompt internal authorities to accord maximum priority 
to dealing with the problems arising out of th e international removal of children, lays down a NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-33  
 non-obligatory time-limit of six weeks, after whic h the applicant or Cent ral Authority of the 
requested State may request a statement of reas ons for the delay. Moreover, after the Central 
Authority of the requested State receives the re ply, it is once more under a duty to inform, a duty 
owed either to the Central Authority of the requ esting State or to the applicant who has applied 
to it directly. In short, the provision’s impor tance cannot be measured in terms of the 
requirements of the obligations imposed by it, but by the very fact that it draws the attention of 
the competent authorities to the decisive nature of  the time factor in such situations and that it 
determines the maximum period of time within which a decision on this matter should be taken. 
Articles 12 and 18 — Duty to return the child 
106 These two articles can be examined togeth er since they complement each other to a 
certain extent, despite their different character. 
Article 12 forms an essential part of the Conven tion, specifying as it does those situations in 
which the judicial or administrative authorities of  the State where the child is located are obliged 
to order its return. That is w hy it is appropriate to emphasize  once again the fact that the 
compulsory return of the child depends, in terms of the Convention, on a decision having been 
taken by the competent authorities of the requested  State. Consequently, th e obligation to return 
a child with which this article deals is laid upon these authorities. To this end, the article 
highlights two cases; firstly, the duty of author ities where proceedings have begun within one 
year of the wrongful rem oval or retention of a child and, sec ondly, the conditions which attach to 
this duty where an application is submitted after the aforementioned time-limit. 
107 In the first paragraph, the ar ticle brings a unique solution to bear upon the problem of 
determining the period during which the authorities concerned must order th e return of the child 
forthwith. The problem is an important one since, in  so far as the return of the child is regarded 
as being in its interests, it is clear that after a child has become settled in its new environment, its 
return should take place only after an examinati on of the merits of the custody rights exercised 
over it — something which is outside the scope  of the Convention. Now, the difficulties 
encountered in any attempt to state this test of ‘integration of the child’  as an objective rule 
resulted in a time-limit being fixed which, althou gh perhaps arbitrary, nevertheless proved to be 
the ‘least bad’ answer to the concerns  which were voiced in this regard. 
108 Several questions had to be faced as a result of this approach: firstly, the date from which 
the time-limit was to begin to run; secondly, ex tension of the time-limit; thirdly, the date of 
expiry of the time-limit. As regards the first point, i.e. how to determine the date on which the 
time-limit should begin to run, the article refers to  the wrongful removal or  retention. The fixing 
of the decisive date in cases of wrongful rete ntion should be understood as that on which the 
child ought to have been returned to its custodians or on which th e holder of the right of custody 
refused to agree to an extension of the child’s stay in a place other than that of its habitual 
residence. Secondly, the establishment of a singl e time-limit of one year (putting on one side the 
difficulties encountered in establishing the child ’s whereabouts) is a substantial improvement on 
the system envisaged in articl e 11 of the Preliminary Draft dr awn up by the Special Commission. 
In fact, the application of the Convention was thus clarified, since the inherent difficulty in having to prove the existence of those problems which can surround the locating of the child was 
eliminated. Thirdly, as regards the terminus ad quem , the article has retained the date on which NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-34  
 proceedings were commenced, instead of the date of  decree, so that potential delays in acting on 
the part of the competent authorities will not harm the interests of parties protected by the Convention. 
To sum up, whenever the circumstances just examin ed are found to be present in a specific case, 
the judicial or administrative aut horities must order the return of the child forthwith, unless they 
aver the existence of one of  the exceptions provided fo r in the Convention itself. 
109 The second paragraph answered to the n eed, felt strongly throughout the preliminary 
proceedings,
41 to lessen the consequences which would flow from the adoption of an inflexible 
time-limit beyond which the provisions of the C onvention could not be invoked. The solution 
finally adopted42 plainly extends the Convention’s scope by maintaining indefinitely a real 
obligation to return the child. In any event, it can not be denied that such  an obligation disappears 
whenever it can be shown that ‘the child is now settled in its new e nvironment’. The provision 
does not state how this fact is to be proved, but it would seem logical to regard such a task as 
falling upon the abductor or upon the person who oppos es the return of the child, whilst at the 
same time preserving the contingent discretionary power of internal authorities in this regard. In 
any case, the proof or verification of a child’s establishment in a new environment opens up the 
possibility of longer proceedings than those en visaged in the first pa ragraph. Finally, and as 
much for these reasons as for the fact that the return will, in th e very nature of things, always 
occur much later than one year after the abduction, the Convention does not speak in this context 
of return ‘forthwith’ but merely of return. 
110 One problem common to both of thes e situations was determining the place  to which the 
child had to be returned. The Conve ntion did not accept a proposal to the effect that the return of 
the child should always be to the State of its ha bitual residence before its removal. Admittedly, 
one of the underlying reasons for requiring the return of the child was the desire to prevent the 
‘natural’ jurisdiction of the cour ts of the State of the child’s residence being evaded with 
impunity, by force. However, including such a pr ovision in the Convention would have made its 
application so inflexible as to be useless. In fact, we must not forget that it  is the right of children 
not to be removed from a particular environm ent which sometimes is a basically family one, 
which the fight against internati onal child abductions seeks to prot ect. Now, when the applicant 
no longer lives in what was the State of the child’ s habitual residence prio r to its removal, the 
return of the child to that State might cause  practical problems which would be difficult to 
resolve. The Convention’s silence on this matte r must therefore be und erstood as allowing the 
authorities of the State of refuge to return the child directly to the applicant, regardless of the 
latter’s present pl ace of residence. 
111 The third paragraph of article 12 introduces  a perfectly logical provision, inspired by 
considerations of procedural economy, by virtue of which the authorities which are acquainted 
with a case can stay the proceedings or dism iss the application, where they have reason to 
believe that the child has been taken to anothe r State. The reasons by which they may come to 
                                                 
41 See Report of the Special Commission, No 92. 
42 See Working Document No 25 (P roposal of the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany) and 
P.-v. Nos 7 and 10. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-35  
 such a conclusion are not stated in the article, and will therefore depend on the internal law of the 
State in question. 
112  Finally, article  18 indicates that nothing in this chapter limits the power of a judicial or 
administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time. This provision, which was 
drafted on the basis of articl e -15 of the Preliminary Draft, and which imposes no duty, 
underlines the non-exhaustive and complementary natu re of the Convention. In  fact, it authorizes 
the competent authorities to or der the return of the child by  invoking other provisions more 
favourable to the attainment of this end. This ma y happen particularly in the situations envisaged 
in the second paragraph of article 12, i.e. where, as a result of an application being made to the 
authority after more than one year has elapsed si nce the removal, the return of the child may be 
refused if it has become settled in its  new social and family environment. 
Articles 13 and 20 — Possible exceptions  to the return of the child 
113 In the first part of this Re port we commented at length upo n the reasons for, the origins 
and scope of, the exceptions contai ned in the articles concerned.43 We shall restrict ourselves at 
this point to making some observations on their liter al meaning. In general, it is appropriate to 
emphasize that the exceptions in these two articles  do not apply automatically, in that they do not 
invariably result in the child’s retention; nevertheless, the very nature of these exceptions gives 
judges a discretion — and does not impose upon them a duty — to refuse to return a child in 
certain circumstances. 
114 With regard to article 13 , the introductory part of the fi rst paragraph highlights the fact 
that the burden of proving the fa cts stated in sub-paragraphs a and b is imposed on the person 
who opposes the return of the child, be he a physic al person, an institution or an organization, 
that person not necessarily being the abductor. The solution adopted is indeed limited to stating 
the general legal maxim that he who avers a fact (or a right) must prove it, but in making this 
choice, the Convention intended to put the dispossessed person in as good a position as the 
abductor who in theory has chosen what is for him the most convenient forum. 
115 The exceptions contained in a arise out of th e fact that the conduct of the person claiming 
to be the guardian of the child raises doubts as to whether a wrongful removal or retention, in 
terms of the Convention, has taken place. On th e one hand, there are situations in which the 
person who had the care of the child did not actua lly exercise custody rights at the time of the 
removal or retention. The Convention includes no  definition of ‘actual exercise’ of custody, but 
this provision expressly refers to the care of the child. Thus, if the text of  this provision is 
compared with that of article 5 which contains a definition of custody rights, it can be seen that 
custody is exercised effectively when the custodia n is concerned with th e care of the child’s 
person, even if, for perfectly valid reasons (illness, educat ion, etc.) in a particular case, the child 
and its guardian do not live together. It follows fro m this that the questio n of whether custody is 
actually exercised or not must be determin ed by the individual judge, according to the 
circumstances of each particular case. 
                                                 
43 See supra , Nos 28 to 35. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-36  
 Moreover, by relating this paragraph to the defin ition of wrongful removal or retention in article 
3, one must conclude that proof that custody was not actually exercised does not form an 
exception to the duty to return the child if th e dispossessed guardian was unable actually to 
exercise his rights precisely becau se of the action of the abductor. In fact, the categorization of 
protected situations, containe d in article 3, governs the w hole Convention, and cannot be 
contradicted by a contrary interpreta tion of any of the other articles. 
On the other hand, the guardian’s conduct can also  alter the characteriza tion of the abductor’s 
action, in cases where he has agreed to, or th ereafter acquiesced in, th e removal which he now 
seeks to challenge. This fact allowed the deleti on of any reference to the exercise of custody 
rights ‘in good faith’, and at th e same time prevented the Convention from being used as a 
vehicle for possible ‘bargaining’ between the parties. 
116 The exceptions contained in b deal with situations where international child abduction 
has indeed occurred, but where the return of the ch ild would be contrary to its interests, as that 
phrase is understood in this sub-pa ragraph. Each of the terms used in this provision is the result 
of a fragile compromise reache d during the deliberations of the Special Commission and has 
been kept unaltered. Thus it cannot be inferred, a contrario , from the rejection during the 
Fourteenth Session of proposals favour ing the inclusion of an expre ss provision stat ing that this 
exception could not be invoked if the return of th e child might harm its economic or educational 
prospects,44 that the exceptions are to receive a wide interpretation. 
117 Nothing requires to be added to the pr eceding commentary on the second paragraph of 
this article (notably in No 31, supra . 
The third paragraph contains a very  different provision which is in fact procedural in nature and 
seeks on the one hand to compensate for the burden of proof placed on the person who opposes the return of the child, and on the other hand to increase the usefulness of information supplied 
by the authorities of the State of  the child’s habitual residence. Such information, emanating 
from either the Central Authority or any other co mpetent authority, may be particularly valuable 
in allowing the requested authorities to determ ine the existence of those circumstances which 
underlie the exceptions contained in the first two paragraphs  of this article. 
118 It is significant that th e possibility, acknowledged in article 20 , that the child may not be 
returned when its return ‘would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms’ has been placed in 
the last article of the chapter: it was thus in tended to emphasize the al ways clearly exceptional 
nature of this provision’s application. As for the substance of this provision, two comments only 
are required. Firstly, even if its literal meaning is strongly reminiscen t of the terminology used in 
international texts concerning the pr otection of human rights, this part icular rule is not directed at 
developments which have occurred on the internat ional level, but is c oncerned only with the 
principles accepted by the law of the requested State, either through ge neral international law 
and treaty law, or through internal legislation. Consequently, so as to be able to refuse to return a 
child on the basis of this article, it will be nece ssary to show that the fundamental principles of 
                                                
 
44 See Working Documents Nos 12 (Proposal of the United States delegation) and 42 ( Proposition de la 
delegation hellenique ), and also P.-v. No 8. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-37  
 the requested State concerning th e subject-matter of the Conven tion do not permit it; it will not 
be sufficient to show merely that its return woul d be incompatible, even manifestly incompatible, 
with these principles. Secondly, such principles  must not be invoked any more frequently, nor 
must their invocation be more readily admissible than they would be in  their application to 
purely internal matters. Otherwise,  the provision would be discri minatory in itself, and opposed 
to one of the most widely recognized fundamental principles in internal laws. A study of the case 
law of different countries shows that the applic ation by ordinary judges of the laws on human 
rights and fundamental freedoms is undertaken w ith a care which one must expect to see 
maintained in the interna tional situations which th e Convention has in view. 
Article 14 — Relaxation of the requi rements of proof of foreign law 
119 Since the wrongful nature of  a child’s removal is made to depend, in terms of the 
Convention, on its having occurred as the result of a br each of the actual exercise of custody 
rights conferred by the law of the child’s habitual re sidence, it is clear that the authorities of the 
requested State will have to take this law in to consideration when deciding whether the child 
should be returned. In this sense, the prov ision in article 13 of the preliminary draft 
Convention,45 that the authorities ‘shall have regard to’ the law of the child’s habitual residence, 
could be regarded as superfl uous. However, such a provision would on the one hand underline 
the fact that there is no question of applying th at law, but merely of using it as a means of 
evaluating the conduct of th e parties, while on the ot her hand, in so far as it applied to decisions 
which could underlie the custody rights that had been breached, it would make the Convention 
appear to be a sort of lex specialis , according to which those decisions would receive effect 
indirectly in the requested State, an effect which would not be made conditional on the obtaining 
of an exequatur  or any other method of recognition of foreign judgments. 
Since the first aspect of article 14 necessarily derives from other provisi ons of the Convention, 
the actual purport of article 14 is concerned onl y with the second. The article therefore appears 
as an optional provision for proving the law of the child’s residence and according to which the 
authority concerned ‘may take no tice directly of the law of, and of judici al or administrative 
decisions, formally recognized or not in the Stat e of habitual residen ce of the child, without 
recourse to the specific proce dures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign 
decisions which would otherwise be applicable’. There is no n eed to stress the practical 
importance this rule may have in leading to th e speedy decisions which are fundamental to the 
working of the Convention. 
Article 15 — The possibility of requesting a decisi on or other determinatio n from the authorities 
of the child’s habitual residence 
120 This article answers to the difficulties which the competent authorities of the requested 
State might experience in reaching a decision on an application for the return of a child through 
being uncertain of how the law of the child’s hab itual residence will apply in a particular case. 
Where this is so, the authorities concerned ca n request ‘that the app licant obtain from the 
authorities of the State of the habitual residenc e of the child a decision or other determination’. 
Only two comments will be made here. The first c oncerns the voluntary nature of the request, in 
                                                 
45 See Report of the Special Commission, Nos 102-103. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-38  
 the sense that the return of the child cannot be made conditional upon such decision or other 
determination being provided. This conclusion arises in fact as mu ch from the actu al terms of the 
article (which speaks of ‘requestin g’ and not ‘requiring ’) as from the fact acknowledged in the 
same provision, that it may be impossible to obtai n the requested documents  in the State of the 
child’s residence. Now, with regard to this  last point, the duty which the article places upon 
Central Authorities to help the applicant obtain the decision or de termination must make his task 
easier, since the Central Authority  can provide a certificate concerni ng its relevant law in terms 
of article 8(3)( f). Secondly, the contents of the decisi on or certificate must have a bearing upon 
the wrongful nature, in the Convent ion sense, of the removal or retention. This means, in our 
opinion, that one or the other will have to contai n a decision on the two elements in article 3, and 
thus establish that the removal wa s in breach of custody rights which, prima facie , were being 
exercised legitimately and in actual fact, in terms of the law of the child’s habitual residence. 
Article 16 — Prohibition against deciding upon the merits of custody rights 
121 This article, so as to promote the realizat ion of the Convention’s objects regarding the 
return of the child, seeks to prevent a decision on the merits of the right to custody being taken in 
the State of refuge. To this end, the competent authorities in this State are forbidden to adjudicate 
on the matter when they have been informed that the child in question has been, in terms of the 
Convention, wrongfully removed or retained. Th is prohibition will disappear when it is shown 
that, according to the Convention, it is not appropri ate to return the child, or where a reasonable 
period of time has elapsed wit hout an application under the C onvention having been lodged. The 
two sets of circumstances which can put an end to the duty cont ained in the article are very 
different, both in the reasons behind them and in  their consequences. In  fact, it is perfectly 
logical to provide that this obligation will cease as  soon as it is established that the conditions for 
a child’s return have not been met, either be cause the parties have come to an amicable 
arrangement or because it is appr opriate to consider on the exceptions provided for in articles 13 
and 20. Moreover, in such cases, the decision on the merits of the custody rights will finally 
dispose of the case. 
On the other hand, since the ‘no tice’ which may justify the prohi bition against deciding upon the 
merits of the case must derive either from an application for the return of the child which is submitted directly by the applicant, or from an official communication from the Central Authority of the same State, it is difficult to see how cases in which the notice is not followed by 
an application would not be contai ned within the first hypothesis. Mo reover, if such situations do 
exist, the ambiguity in the phrase ‘reasonable time ’ could lead to decisions being taken before 
the period of one year, contained in article 12, firs t paragraph, has expired; in such a case, this 
decision would coexist alongside the duty to return the ch ild, in accordance w ith the Convention, 
thus giving rise to a problem wh ich is dealt with in article 17. 
Article 17 — The existence of a decisi on on custody in the requested State 
122 The origins of this article clearly dem onstrate the end pursued. The First Commission 
initially adopted a provision which gave absolute priority to the applicat ion of the Convention, 
by making the duty to return the child prevail over any other decisi on on custody, which had 
been issued or was likely to be issued in the requested State. At the same time, it accepted the 
possibility of a reservation allowing the return of the child to be refused, when its return was NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-39  
 shown to be incompatible with a decision existing in the State of refuge, prior to the 
‘abduction’.46 The current text is therefore the result of a compromise which was reached in 
order to eliminate a reservation in the Conventi on, without at the same time reducing the extent 
of its acceptability to the States.47 In this way, the original provision was recast by emphasizing 
that the sole fact that a decision existed would no t of itself prevent the return of the child, and by 
allowing judges to take into consideration the reasons for this decision in coming to a decision 
themselves on the application for the child’s return. 
123 The solution contained in this article accords perfectly with the object of the Convention, 
which is to discourage potential abductors, who will not be able to defend their action by means 
either of a ‘dead’ decision taken prior to the rem oval but never put into effect, or of a decision 
obtained subsequently, which will, in the majority  of cases, be vitiate d by fraud. Consequently, 
the competent authority of the requested State will have to regard the application for the child’s 
return as proof of the fact that a new factor has been introduced which obliges it to reconsider a 
decision which has not been put into effect, or  which was taken on the basis of exorbitant 
grounds of jurisdiction, or else fail ed to have regard to the right of all the parties concerned to 
state their case. Moreover, since the decision on th e return of the child is not concerned with the 
merits of custody rights, the reasons for the deci sion which may be taken into consideration are 
limited to those which concern ‘the application of  the Convention’. A situation brought about by 
a decision issued by the authori ties of the State of a child’s habitual residence prior to its 
‘abduction’ and which granted cu stody to the ‘abductor’, would normally be resolved by 
applying article 3 of the Conventio n, since the existence of a clai med right to custody must be 
understood in accordance with the law of that State. 
Article 19 — Scope of the decisi ons on the return of the child 
124 This provision expresses an  idea which underlies the whol e of the Convention; as a 
matter of fact, in this Report we  have already been concerned on several occasions as much with 
the reasons for it as with commenting upon it. This article is restricted to  stating the scope of 
decisions taken regarding the re turn of the child which the C onvention seeks to guarantee, a 
return which, so as to be ‘forth with’ or ‘speedy’, must not prej udge the merits of custody rights; 
this provision seeks to prevent a later decision on  these rights being influenced by a change of 
circumstances brought about by the unilate ral action of one of the parties. 
CHAPTER IV - RIGHTS OF ACCESS 
Article 21 
125 Above all, it must be rec ognized that the Conv ention does not seek to regulate access 
rights in an exhaustive manner;  this would undoubtedly go beyond the scope of the Convention’s 
                                                 
46 Working Documents Nos 53, paragraph 2 (Proposal  of the United Kingdom delegation), 32, article XG 
(Proposal of the Netherlands delegation), and 19 (Pr oposal of the Japanese delegation), as well as P.-v. 
No 12. 
47 See Working Document No 77 (Proposal of the Chairman, supported by the Rapporteur and the 
delegations of Australia, Canada, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Spain, 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and P.-v. No 17. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-40  
 objectives. Indeed, even if the attention which has been paid to access rights results from the 
belief that they are the normal corollary of custody ri ghts, it sufficed at the Convention level 
merely to secure co-operation among Central Author ities as regards either their organization or 
the protection of their actu al exercise. In other re spects, the best indication of the high level of 
agreement reached regarding access rights is the particularly short amount of time devoted to 
them by the First Commission. 
126 As we have just pointed out , the article as a whole rest s upon co-operation among Central 
Authorities. A proposal which sought to insert  a provision in a new paragraph that both the 
authorities and the law of the State of the child’s habitual residence should have exclusive 
jurisdiction in questions of access right s, was rejected by a large majority.48 The organizing and 
securing of the actual exercise of access rights wa s thus always seen by the Convention as an 
essential function of the Central Authorities. U nderstood thus, the first paragraph contains two 
important points: in the first place, the freedom of  individuals to apply to the Central Authority 
of their choice, and secondly the fact that the purpose of the app lication to the Central Authority 
can be either the organi zation of access rights, i.e. their establishment, or the protection of the 
exercise of previously determined access rights. Now, recourse to legal proceedings will arise very frequently, especially when the applica tion seeks to organize rights which are merely 
claimed or when their exercise runs up agains t opposition from the holder of the rights of 
custody. With this in view, the article’s third paragraph envisages the possibility of Central 
Authorities initiating or assisting in such proceed ings, either directly, or through intermediaries. 
127 The nature of the problems t ackled in the second paragraph is  very different. Here it is a 
question of securing the peaceful enjoyment of  access rights without endangering custody rights. 
This provision therefore contains important elemen ts for the attainment of  this end. Once again, 
co-operation among Central Authorities is placed, of  necessity, in the very centre of the picture, 
and it is a co-operation designed as much to prom ote the exercise of access rights as to guarantee 
the fulfilment of any conditions to wh ich their exercise may be subject. 
Of all the specific ways of securing the exerci se of access rights, article 21 contains only one, 
where it points out that the Central Authority must try ‘to remove, as far as  possible, all obstacles 
to the exercise of such rights’, obstacles whic h may be legal ones or ma y originate in possible 
criminal liability. The rest is left up to th e co-operation among Central Authorities, which is 
regarded as the best means of ensuring respec t for the conditions imposed upon the exercise of 
access rights. In fact, such respect is the only m eans of guaranteeing to the custodian that their 
exercise will not harm his own rights. 
128 The Convention gives no examples of how Ce ntral Authorities are to organize this co-
operation so as to secure the ‘innocent’ exercise of access rights, since such examples could have 
been interpreted restrictively. Mention could how ever be made purely indicatively as in the 
Report of the preliminary draft Convention,
49 of the fact that it would be advisable that the 
child’s name not appear on the passport of th e holder of the right of access, whilst in 
‘transfrontier’ access cases it woul d be sensible for the holder of  the access rights to give an 
                                                 
48 See Working Document No 31 (Proposal of the Danish delegation) and P.-v. No 13. 
49 See Report of the Special Commission. No 110. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-41  
 undertaking to the Central Authority of the child’s  habitual residence to return the child on a 
particular date and to indicate al so the places where he  intends to stay with  the child. A copy of 
such an undertaking would then be sent to the Ce ntral Authority of the habitual residence of the 
holder of the access rights, as well as  to the Central Author ity of the State in which he has stated 
his intention of staying with the child. This  would enable the au thorities to know the 
whereabouts of the child at any time and to se t in motion proceedings for bringing about its 
return, as soon as the stated time-limit has expired. Of course , none of the measures could by 
itself ensure that access rights ar e exercised properly, but in any .event we believe that this 
Report can go no further: the specific measures wh ich the Central Authorities concerned are able 
to take will depend on the circum stances of each case and on the capacity to act enjoyed by each 
Central Authority. 
CHAPTER V - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
129 This chapter contains a series of provisi ons which differ according to the topics with 
which they deal, and which had to  be dealt with outside the fram ework of the foregoing chapters. 
On the one hand, there are certai n procedural provisions common bot h to the proceedings for the 
return of the child and to the organization of access rights, and on the other hand there are 
provisions for regulating the problems arising out of  the Convention’s applic ation in States with 
more than one system of law, as well as th ose which concern its re lationship with other 
conventions and its scope ratione temporis . 
Article 22 — ‘Cautio judicatum solvi’ 
130 Following a marked tendency to favour the de letion from the Convention of procedural 
measures which discriminated against foreigners, this article declares that no security, bond or 
deposit, however described, shall be required within the context of the Convention. Two short 
comments are in order here. The first conc erns the scope of the stated prohibition ratione 
personae ; on this point, an extremely liberal soluti on was arrived at, such as was required by a 
convention built upon the basic id ea of protecting children.50 Secondly, the security, bond or 
deposit from which foreigners are exempt are t hose which, in any legal system and howsoever 
described, are meant to guarantee respect for d ecisions on the payment of costs and expenses 
arising out of legal proceedings. The article, in its  concern for coherence, states that the rule will 
apply only to those ‘judicial or administrativ e proceedings falling within the scope of the 
Convention’, and avoids a wider formulation whic h could have been interpreted as applicable, 
for example, to proceedings raised directly for a decision on the merits of custody rights. On the 
other hand, it can clearly be inferred from the preceding observations that it does not prevent 
other types of security, bond or deposit being required, particular ly those which are imposed so 
as to guarantee the proper exercise of access rights. 
Article 23 — Exemption from legalization 
131 This article repeats word for word the text of the equivalent artic le in the preliminary 
draft Convention, which merely set forth in a sepa rate provision an idea wh ich is to be found in 
                                                 
50 See the more restrictive construction which was incorporated in article 14 of the Convention on 
International Access to Justice , also adopted during the Fourteenth Session of the Conference. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-42  
 all Hague Conventions, involving the transmission of documents among Contracting States. The 
fact that it has been drafted in wide terms mean s that not only ‘diplomatic  legalization’, but also 
any other similar sort of requirement, is forbidde n. However, any requirement of the internal law 
of the authorities in question that copies or pr ivate documents be authenticated remains outside 
the scope of th is provision. 
Article 24 — Translation of documents 
132 As regards the languages which are to be used as among Central Authorities, the 
Convention upheld the approach in the Preliminary Draft, by which documents are to be sent in their original language, accompanied by a translati on into one of the official languages of the 
requested State or, where that is not feasib le, a translation into French or English.
51 In this 
matter, the Convention also allows  a reservation to be made in terms of article 42, under which a 
Contracting State can object to th e use of one or other of the substitute languages, but this 
reservation cannot of course excl ude the use of both. Finally, it must be emphasized firstly that 
the scheme which has been chosen offers only a minimal  facility and may be improved upon by 
other conventions which exclude any requirement of  translation as among States which are Party 
to them, and secondly that it governs onl y communications among Central Authorities. 
Consequently, applications and other documents sent to internal judicial or administrative 
authorities will have to conform to the rules re garding translation laid down by the law of each 
State. 
Article 25 — Legal aid and advice 
133 The relevant provision here enlarges the scop e of legal aid in two respects. Firstly, it 
includes among the possible beneficiaries persons ha bitually resident in a Contracting State as 
well as that State’s own nationals. Secondly, the legal aid available is extended to cover legal 
advice as well, which is not invariably included in the various systems of legal aid operated by 
States.52 
Article 26 — Costs arising out of the Conventi on’s application 
134 The principle enunciated in the first paragraph, under which each Central Authority bears 
its own costs in applying the Convention, met no opposition. Quite simply, it means that a Central Authority cannot claim costs from an other Central Authority. It must however be 
admitted that the costs envisaged will depend on the actual services provided by each Central Authority, according to the freedom of action c onferred upon it by the internal law of the State 
concerned. 
135 On the other hand, the second paragraph refers  to one of the most controversial matters 
dealt with by the Fourteenth Session, a matter which in the end had to be resolved by accepting 
the reservation in the third paragraph of the same article. In fact, the argument between those 
                                                
 
51 A somewhat different approach is found in article 7 of the Convention on International Access to 
Justice , referred to supra . 
52 See, in similar vein, articles I and 2 of the Convention on International Access to Justice , referred to 
supra . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-43  
 delegations which wanted the applic ant to be exempt from all cost s arising out of the application 
of the Convention (including exem ption from all costs and expens es not covered by the legal aid 
and advice system such as those which arise out of legal proceedings or, where applicable, the 
participation of counsel or le gal advisers), and those which favoured the opposi te solution 
adopted by the preliminary draft Convention,53 was resolved only by including a reservation 
favouring the latter’s point of view. The reason fo r this was that, since different criteria for the 
granting of legal aid were rooted in the very  structure of the legal systems concerned, any 
attempt to make one approach prevail absolutely over the others would have led to the automatic 
exclusion of certain States from the Convention, a result which no one wanted.54 However, there 
was total agreement as regards the rule containe d in the last sentence of the second paragraph, 
authorizing the Central Authorities to ‘require th e payment of the expenses incurred or to be 
incurred in implementing the return of the child’. 
136 The fourth paragraph contains a quite diffe rent type of provision, by which the competent 
internal authorities may direct the ‘abductor’ or  the person who prevented the exercise of access 
rights, to pay necessary expenses  incurred by or on behalf of th e applicant, including ‘travel 
expenses, any costs incurred or payments made  for locating the child, the costs of legal 
representation of the applicant, a nd those of returning the child’. But since this rule is only an 
optional provision, which recognizes the discretion which may be exercised by the courts in each 
case, its scope would seem to be particularly sy mbolic, a possible deterrent to behaviour which is 
contrary to the objec ts of the Convention. 
Article 27 — Possible rejection of an application 
137 Common sense would indicate that Centra l Authorities cannot be obliged to accept 
applications which belong outside the scope of  the Convention or are manifestly without 
foundation. In such cases, the only duty of Centra l Authorities is to ‘inform forthwith the 
applicant or the Central Authority through whic h the application was submitted, as the case may 
be, of its reasons’. This means th at an application may be reject ed by the Central Authority to 
which the applicant applied directly as well as  by a Central Authority which was initially brought 
into the case by another Central Authority. 
Article 28 — Authorization requi red by the Central Authority 
138 The provision in this article is merely anot her example of the Conven tion’s attitude to the 
organization and powers of Central Authorities. Si nce the aim is to avoid requiring States to 
change their own law in order to be able to accept the Convention, the Convention takes into 
consideration the fact that, in terms of the law of various Member States of the Conference the 
Central Authority would have the power to requir e some authorization from the applicant. As a 
matter of fact, the ‘model form’, as an example of the documents which might be attached to an 
application (see note to No IX),  brings in a reference to ‘the authorization empowering the 
Central Authority to act on beha lf of the applicant’, an aut horization which, every time it is 
                                                 
53 Article 22(2)(a) of the Preliminary Draf t prepared by the Special Commission. 
54 See Working Documents Nos 51 and 61 ( Propositions de la delegation beige ) and Nos 57 and 67 
(Proposals of the Canadian, Netherlands and United States delegations) and also P.-v. Nos 11 and 14. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-44  
 required by a Central Authority, will  have to accompany those matte rs listed in article 8 and the 
applications submitted under article 21. 
Article 29 - Direct application to  competent inte rnal authorities 
139 The Convention does not seek to  establish a system for the return of children which is 
exclusively for the benefit of the Contracting Stat es. It is put forward ra ther as an additional 
means for helping persons whose custody or a ccess rights have been breached. Consequently, 
those persons can either have recourse to the Central Authorities — in other words, use the 
means provided in the Convention — or else pursue a direct action before the competent 
authorities in matters of custody and access in the State where the child is located. In the latter 
case, whenever the persons concerned opt to apply directly to the relevant  authorities, a second 
choice is open to them in that they can subm it their application ‘whe ther or not under the 
provisions of this Convention’. In the latter case the authorities are not of course obliged to apply 
the provisions of the Convention, un less the State has incorp orated them into its internal law, in 
terms of article 2 of the Convention. 
Article 30 — Admissibility of documents 
140 This provision was intended to resolve the problem which ex isted in some Member States 
regarding the admissibility of documents. It merely seeks to facilitate admission before the 
judicial or administrative author ities of Contracting States of applications submitted either 
directly or through the intervention of a Centra l Authority, as well as documents which may be 
attached or supplied by the Central Authorities. In fact, this article mu st not be understood to 
contain a rule on the evidential value which is  to be placed on these documents, since that 
problem falls quite outwith the scope of the Convention.55 
Articles 31 to 33 — Application of  the Convention in relation to States with more than one 
system of law 
141 These three articles govern th e Convention’s application to States with non-unitary legal 
systems. As in recent conventions of the Ha gue Conference, a distinction has been drawn 
between States which have several systems of law applicable in different territorial units, and 
those with several systems of la w applicable to different categ ories of persons. To be more 
precise, the solution adopted received its inspirat ion from that reached by the conventions drawn 
up during the Thirteenth Session of the Conference.56 
As regards the first group of St ates, article 31 explains how refe rences to the child’s habitual 
residence and to the law of the State of its habitual re sidence are to be understood. 
As regards the second type, article 32 leaves the determination of the applicable law to the rules 
in force in each State. 
                                                 
55 See article 26 of the preliminary draft Convention, Working Document No 49 (Proposal of the United 
States delegation) and P.-v. No 11. 
56 See in particular Mr von Overbeck’s Report on the Convention on the Law Applicable to Matrimonial 
Property Regimes, in Acts and Documents of the Thirteenth Session , Book II, p. 374 et seq . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-45  
 Finally, it must be emphasized th at the substantive provisions of these two articles are not 
restricted to the States directly concerned. In actu al fact, the relevant rule s are to be taken into 
consideration by all Contracting States in their re lations with each other, for example whenever a 
child is removed from one of those States to another State with a unified or non-unified legal 
system. 
142 On the other hand, article 33 limits the occasions  where States with more than one system 
of law are obliged to apply the Convention, by excluding  those in which a State with a unified 
system of law would not be bound to do so. Put shortly, this article me rely states that the 
Convention applies only at the inte rnational level and at the same time characterize s as internal 
all those relationships which arise within a State,  whether or not that State has more than one 
system of law. 
Article 34 — Relationship to other conventions 
143 This article was commented upon in the fi rst part of the Report (Nos 39 and 40). 
Article 35 — Scope of the C onvention ratione temporis 
144 The question as to whether the Conventi on should apply to abductions involving two 
States and which occurred prior to its entry into force or only to those occurring ther eafter, was 
met with different proposed solutions during the Fourteenth Session. The first proposal was 
undoubtedly the most liberal, since it envisaged the Convention’s applying to all ‘abductions’, 
irrespective of when it came into effect.57 However, this decision was followed by acceptance of 
the idea that any Contracting State could decl are that the Convention would apply only to 
‘abductions’ which occurred after its entry into force in that State.58 The situation therefore 
remained largely unresolved, with each State, wher e it deemed this necessary, being able to limit 
the Convention’s application. It was clear that the operation of such declarations within a 
convention which is clearly bilateral in its appli cation would create some technical problems, to 
alleviate which the First Commissi on finally pronounced itself in  favour of the opposite solution 
to that first adopted, i.e. the more restrictive. It is seen  therefore in article 35, by which the 
Convention is to apply as among Contracting Stat es ‘only to wrongful removals or retentions 
occurring after its entry in to force in those States’.59 On the other hand, the inference must be 
drawn from the Convention’s provisions as a whole (and in particul ar article 12, second 
paragraph) that no time-limit is imposed on the su bmission of applicati ons, provided the child 
has not reached sixteen years of age, in terms of article 4. In fact, the commencement of an 
action after the expiry of the one year period stat ed in the first paragraph of article 12, merely 
lessens the obligation to cause the child to be retu rned, whilst it is recognized that the obligation 
will not arise if the child is shown to have  become settled in its new environment. 
                                                 
57 See Working Document No 53 (Proposal of the United Kingdom delegation) and P. -v. No 13. 
58 See Working Document No 68 (Proposal of the Canadian delegation) and P.-v. No 15. 
59 See Working Document No 81 (Pr oposal of the Chairman with the consent of the delegations of 
Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany. Switzer land and the United Kingdom) and P.-v. No 18. An 
oral proposal of the Reporter that the Convention be  extended to cover situations which occurred during 
the year prior to its entry into force was not accepted. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-46  
 145 The provision certainly has the merit of being clear. However, it cannot be denied that its 
application is fated to frustrate the legitimate expectations of the in dividuals concerned. But 
since in the last resort it is a limitation on the duty to return the child, it in no way prevents two 
or more States agreeing amongst themselves to  derogate from it in terms of article 36, by 
agreeing to apply the Convention retroactively. 
Moreover, the provision concerns only those provis ions in the Convention re garding the return of 
the child. In actual fact, the provision of th e Convention governing access rights can, in the 
nature of things, only be invoked wh ere their exercise is refused or  continues to be refused after 
the Convention has come into force. 
Article 36 — Possibility of limi ting by agreement the restrictions  on the return of the child 
146 This article, conform to the general pr inciples underlying the Convention, which are 
based on the experience derived from other Hague Conventions,60 allows two or more 
Contracting States to agree to derogate as am ongst themselves from any of the Convention’s 
provisions which may involve restri ctions on the return of the child , in particular those contained 
in articles 13 and 20. This demonstrates, on the one hand, the compromise character of some of 
the Convention’s provisions and th e possibility that cr iteria more favourable to the principal 
object of the Convention may be adopted to govern  relationships among Stat es which share very 
similar legal concepts, while on the other han d, as we have emphasized on several occasions 
throughout this Report, the Conventi on is not to be regard ed as in any way ex clusive in its scope. 
Now, if such supplementary conventions see the light of day, one negative consequence, feared 
by some delegations, will have to  be avoided, namely that beyond the geographical limits of such 
agreements, the States concerned will be tempte d to interpret the limitations contained in the 
Convention in a wide sense, thus weakening its scope.61 
CHAPTER VI- FINAL CLAUSES 
147 The final clauses in articles 37 to 45 of th e Convention have been drafted in accordance 
with similar provisions adopted by the most recent sessions of the Hague Conference. No 
detailed commentary is therefore necessary an d we shall make only a few brief comments on 
them. 
Firstly, the adaptation of the fi nal clauses to the decision wh ich was taken on the conditional 
opening of the Convention to non-Member States . This point has been dealt with earlier,62 and it 
is sufficient merely to emphasize here that the ‘semi- closed’ character of the Convention derives 
from the means by which States Parties may declare their acceptance and not from any 
restriction placed on the States wh ich may accede to it (article 38). 
                                                 
60 See, for example, the Convention of 1 March 1954 on civil procedure . 
61 See Working Documents Nos 70 ( Proposition des delegations beige,  francaise et luxembourgeoise ) 
and 80 (Proposal of the United States delegation) as well as P.-v. Nos 16 and 18. 
62 See supra , No 42. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page F-47  
 148 With regard to the ‘degree’  of acceptance of the Conventi on by States which contain two 
or more territorial units in which different system s of law are applicable to matters dealt with in 
this Convention, article 40 provides that they may declare — at the time of  signature, ratification, 
acceptance, approval or accession — that the Conventi on shall extend to all its territorial units or 
only to one or more of them. Such a declaratio n can be modified at any time by another more 
extensive declaration. Actuall y, any modification of a declar ation which tends to limit the 
applicability of th e Convention ought to be regarded as a partial denunciation in terms of article 
44, third paragraph. 
Under article 39, the same result will occur with re gard to States which are responsible for the 
international relations of other te rritories. Although such situati ons are meant to disappear as a 
logical consequence of the progressive applicati on of the principle which proclaims the right of 
peoples to self-determination, the Conference felt it  advisable to keep a clause which might yet 
prove to be useful. 
149 Finally, a word should be said on article 41, since it contains a wholly novel provision in 
Hague Conventions. It also appe ars in the other Convention adopt ed at the Fourteenth Session, 
i.e. the Convention on International Access to Justice , at the express request  of the Australian 
delegation. 
This article seeks to make it cl ear that ratification of the Convention by a State will carry no 
implication as to the internal distribution of ex ecutive, judicial and legislative powers in that 
State. 
This may seem self-evident, and this is the po int which the head of the Canadian delegation 
made during the debates of the Fourth Commi ssion where it was decide d to insert such a 
provision in both C onventions (see P.  -v. No 4 of the Plenary Session ). The Canadian delegation, 
openly expressing the opinion of a large number of delegations, regarded the insertion of this 
article in the two Conventions as  unnecessary. Nevertheless, arti cle 41 was adopted, largely to 
satisfy the Australian delegation, for which the absence of such a provision would apparently 
have created insuperable c onstitutional difficulties. 
150 On the question of reservations, the Conventio n allows only those prov ided for in articles 
24 and 26. No other reservation is permitted. Moreover, article 42 sets forth the customary provision whereby a State can ‘at any time withdraw a reserva tion it has made’. 
151 Finally, the importance placed on the duty which was assumed by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Kingdom of the Neth erlands (article 45) to notify Member States and Contracting 
States should be emphasized, particularly in view of the role played by declarations of 
acceptance of future accessions in  a convention such as this.

AMENDED ORDER GRANTING EX PARTE  TRO AND EMERGENCY EQUITABLE RELIEF 
THRASH, J. 
*1 Plaintiff/Petitioner Isaac Robles Antonio (“Petitioner”), having filed his “EX PARTE  MOTION UNDER THE 
HAGUE CONVENTION FOR ENTRY OF A TRO, APPLICATION FOR WARRANT SEEKING PHYSICAL 
CUSTODY OF CHILD, AND SCHEDULING OF AN EXPEDITED HEARING” (“Motion”), and the Court having 
conducted a hearing on the Motion on Tuesday, June 1, 2004, and after considering the arguments of Petitioner’s 
counsel and the entire r ecord, and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 , the Court hereby GRANTS the 
Motion, ruling as follows: 
(1) This Court finds that ex parte  emergency relief is necessary to prevent irreparable injury. Specifically, the 
evidence of record shows that on November 29, 2 003, Defendant/Respondent Josefina Barrios Bello 
(“Respondent”), who is currently married to Petitioner, wr ongfully removed their seven-year-old daughter, Itzel 
Ameyalli Robles Barrios, without Petitioner’s acquiescence or consent, from their familial home in Mexico and smuggled the child into the United States. Given that Re spondent has already abducted the child and herself faces 
the risk of apprehension here, there exists a clear risk th at Respondent will further secret the child and herself, in 
violation of the Hague Convention, and not appear before this Court to resolve the claim presented by Petitioner. 
Accordingly, and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)
, the Court finds it necessary to grant this Order 
without notice. 
(2) Respondent is hereby prohibited from removing Petitioner’s daughter, Itzel Ameyalli Robles Barrios, from the 
jurisdiction of this Court pending a hearing on the merits of  the Verified Complaint, and no person acting in concert 
or participating with Respondent (including, without limitation, Respondent’s brother, Santiago Barrios Bello, and 
her boyfriend, Cesar Guillermo Erasto Partida) shall take an y action to remove the child from the jurisdiction of this 
Court pending a determination on the merits of this Petition. 
(3) A preliminary injunction hearing on the merits of the Verified Complaint is hereby scheduled to be held on 
Friday, June 4, 2004, at 9 a.m. in Courtroom 2108 of this United States District Court, 75 Spring Street, Atlanta, 
Georgia 30303. 
(4) Respondent is hereby directed to show cause at the hearing scheduled in paragraph (3) above why the child 
should not be returned to Mexico, accompanied by Petiti oner, where an appropriate custody determination can be 
made under Mexican law, and why the other relief requeste d in the Verified Complaint should not be granted. 
(5) The Court hereby orders that the trial of this acti on on the merits be advanced and consolidated with the 
preliminary injunction hearing scheduled in paragraph (3) above. 
(6) The Court hereby orders the United States Marshals Service to take physical custody of the child, 7-year old Itzel 
Ameyalli Robles Barrios, and bring the child to a United States Magistrate Judge. The United States Marshals 
Service shall notify Petitioner’s counsel of the date and ti me that Itzel Ameyalli Robles Barrios will be brought NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page G-2  
 
 before a Magistrate Judge, and Petitioner is hereby ordered to appear before the Magistrate Judge at that date and 
time. The Magistrate Judge shall ther eupon arrange for the child to be pl aced in Petitioner’s temporary physical 
custody and otherwise set conditions consistent with this. Order to guarantee that both Petitioner and the child will 
attend the preliminary injunction hearing scheduled in this case. 
*2 (7) Pending the hearing, Petitioner’s daughter will be pl aced and remain in his temporary custody. Petitioner is 
hereby ordered to bring the child and himself to the preliminary injunction hearing scheduled in this case. 
(8) The United States Marshals Service is further directed to serve Respondent with this Order, as well as the 
pleadings filed by Petitioner in this case. 
(9) To execute this Order, the United States Marshals Se rvice may enlist the assistance  of other law enforcement 
authorities, including the local police. 
(10) The “Order Granting Ex Parte  TRO and Emergency Equitable Relief” entered by this Court at 11 a.m. on June 
1, 2004 is hereby superseded by this Amended Order. 
SO ORDERED.

ORDER GRANTING RELIEF UNDER THE HAGUE CONVENTION AND THE INTERNATIONAL CHILD 
ABDUCTION REMEDIES ACT 
THRASH, J. 
*1 On May 28, 2004, Plaintiff/Petitione r Isaac Robles Antonio (“ Petitioner”) filed a “Verified Complaint/Petition 
under the Hague Convention for Return of Child to Plaintiff/Petitioner in Mexico, Including Provisional Orders, an Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order, Application for Warrant Seeking Physical Custody and an Expedited 
Hearing” (“Complaint”), seeking the return of his seven- year-old daughter, Itzel Ameyalli Robles Barrios (“Itzel”), 
who Petitioner asserts was wrongfully removed from their familial home in Mexico by his wife, 
Defendant/Respondent Josefina Barrios Bello (“Respondent”). On June 4, 2004, a preliminary injunction hearing 
was held before the Court which was, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2)
, consolidated with a trial 
on the merits. After considering the evidence submitted at the hearing, the arguments of counsel, and the entire 
record, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: 
FINDINGS  OF FACT  
1. Itzel is the natural child of Petitioner and Respondent. Respondent is Petitioner’s wife. From the time of Itzel’s birth until November 29, 2003, she lived with Petitioner and Respondent at their home in Mexico. 
2. On November 29, 2003, Respondent wrongfully removed Itzel from her home and habitual residence in Mexico 
and brought her to the United States. 
3. Up until the time Respondent wrongfully removed the child from Mexico, Petitioner and Respondent had joint 
legal and physical custody of the ch ild under Mexican law. This removal breached Petitioner’s custody rights under 
Mexican law, which rights the Petitioner exerci sed at the time of the child’s removal. 
4. Respondent brought both herself and Itzel to this country illegally. 
5. Petitioner has filed for divorce in Mexico, seeking cust ody of Itzel. The Court finds that the court in Mexico 
should determine whether Petitioner or Respondent should have custody of Itzel and does not by this order make a 
custody determination. 
6. The Court appointed a guardian ad litem for Itzel, Vionnette Reyes, who made a report and recommendation to 
the Court at the hearing. The guardian ad litem interviewed the child, Petitioner and Respondent. According to the 
guardian ad litem, there is no evidence that the Petitioner ever abused Itzel. The guardian ad litem further 
recommended that the child should be returned to Mexico  for an appropriate custody determination by the Mexican 
court, especially given that the child is in this country  illegally. The guardian ad litem further stated that, in her 
opinion and based on her investigation, Itzel was in no physical or psychological danger while in the custody of her 
father (Petitioner). NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page G-5  
 
 7. While Respondent testified at the hearing that Petitioner had physically abused her during the marriage, she made 
no claim and submitted no evidence that Petitioner had ever harmed Itzel. 
8. Respondent did not prove that any of the exceptions provided in the Hague Convention applies in this case. 
CONCLUSIONS  OF LAW  
*2 1. “A petitioner establishes a prima facie case of wrongful  removal by demonstrating by a preponderance of the 
evidence that: 1) the habitual residence of the child immediately before the date of the alleged wrongful removal 
was in the foreign country; 2) the re moval breached the petitioner’s custody righ ts under the foreign country’s law; 
and 3) the petitioner exercised custody of the child at the time of her alleged removal.” Gil v. Rodriguez,  184 
F.Supp.2d 1221, 1224 (M.D.Fla.2002) (citations omitted). 
2. “A respondent may avoid returning the child to petitioner if respondent can demonstrate by clear and convincing 
evidence that: 1) return would ‘expose th e child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an 
intolerable situation’ or; 2) if the child objects to return and is of sufficient age and maturity to do so; or 3) if return 
would not be permitted by fundamental American principles concerning the protection of human rights and 
freedoms. Furthermore, to avoid return, a respondent may demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that: 1) 
more than one year has elapsed since the child’s removal and the child is settled in her new environment or; 2) the petitioner does not really have custody rights; or 3) petitioner has consented or acquiesced to the removal.” Id.
 
(citations omitted). 
3. Petitioner has met his burden by establishing that: 1) Itzel habitually resided in Mexico prior to her removal on 
November 29, 2003; 2) by removing Itzel, Respondent br eached Petitioner’s custodial ri ghts under Mexican law; 
and 3) Petitioner possessed custodial rights at the time of Itzel’s removal. 
4. Respondent has not proved that any of the exceptions to the Hague Convention apply. 5. Accordingly, the Court hereby orders that Itzel must be returned to Mexico by her father pending a custody 
determination by the courts of Mexico. 
This Order and the Court’s verbal order of June 4, 2004, are stayed pursuant to the order of the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit until further order of that Court.

2004  WL 1895127  (N.D.Ga.)  
United States District Court, 
N.D. Georgia, Atlanta Division. 
Isaac ROBLES ANTONIO, Plaintiff, 
v. 
Josefina BARRIOS BELLO, Defendant. 
No. Civ.A.1:04-CV-1555-T.  
June 7, 2004. 
James Francis Bogan, III, Kilpatrick Stockton, Richard Allen Horder, Kilpatrick Stockton, Atlanta, GA, for Plaintiff.

ORDER  
THRASH, J. 
*1 This is an action under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the 
International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11601 -11610 . The Petitioner seeks to have his seven-
year-old daughter returned to Mexico. It is before the Court on the Respondent’s Motion to Stay the Order granting the relief requested in the Petition. 
The Petitioner and the Respondent are the natural parents of Itzel Ameyalli Robles Barrios. Until November 29, 
2003, the child lived with her parents in their home in Mexico. On that date, while Petitioner was at work, the Respondent fled with the child. She left a note telling Petitioner not to look for them. Through relatives and others, 
the Petitioner learned that the Respondent had smuggled herself and the child into the United States and was living 
at an address on Buford Highway in Atlanta, Georgi a. The Petitioner filed an action for divorce in Mexico. 
This action was filed on May 28, 2004. On June 1, 2004, I held an ex parte hearing and entered an order directing 
the United States Marshals to take custody of the child and bring her before a Magistrate Judge. The Order also 
directed the United States Marshals to serve the Responde nt with the Petition and notify her of a hearing on the 
Petition to be held on June 4, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. The Respondent was served on June 2, 2004. The child was brought 
before Magistrate Judge Scofield who appointed Vionnette Reyes, a Spanish-speaking attorney, as her guardian ad 
litem. The Magistrate Judge released the child into the custody of the Petitioner with conditions to assure their appearance at the hearing on June 4, 2004. 
On June 2, 2004, I started the jury trial of United  States  v. Joseph  Ryan.  On the second day of trial, at 4:30 p.m., I 
interrupted the trial to have a conference call in this case . During the conference call, an  attorney for the Respondent 
requested postponement of the June 4 hearing because he said he needed mo re time to prepare. I stated that because 
of my trial schedule, it would probably be a month before I could reschedule the hearing. Counsel for the Petitioner 
objected to postponement of the hearing under these circumstances. I then told counsel for the Respondent that the 
hearing would have to proceed as scheduled. 
On June 4, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., I held a hearing on th e merits of the Petition. The Petitioner was represented by 
lawyers from the law firm of Kilpatrick Stockton. The Respondent was present and represented by lawyers from the 
law firm of King & Spalding. The Petitioner and the Respondent testified at the hearing. She testified that he had hit 
her, locked her in a room and raped her. He denied that . There was no testimony that the Petitioner had ever abused 
or mistreated the child. I heard argument from counsel fo r both parties. The guardian ad litem recommended that the 
child be returned to Mexico with her father with the ultima te custody decision to be made by the courts in Mexico. I 
followed that recommendation and granted the relief requested in the Petition. 
*2 The Respondent moved for an order staying the Order granting the Petition. I denied the Respondent’s motion to 
stay for the following reasons. First, the likelihood of success on appeal is low. It is undisputed that the Respondent NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page G-7  
 
 smuggled herself and the child from Me xico into this co untry and that they were living here illegally. It is 
undisputed that she did that in violation of the Petitione r’s custody rights under Mexi can law. The Respondent was 
subject to arrest, detention and deportation at any time. Ther e was no evidence in the hearin g or in the report of the 
guardian ad litem that returning the child to the Petitioner and returning her to Mexico would result in any harm to the child. The testimony of spousal abuse was legally insuff icient to establish an exception to the mandate of the 
Hague Convention. Under these circumstances, not granting the relief requested would have been an abuse of 
discretion. This is not a close case. 
The Respondent may raise procedural issues on appeal. Certainly, under other circumstances, I would have given the 
Respondent more notice of the hearing and counsel more ti me to prepare, Unfortunately, this matter came up in the 
middle of a lengthy criminal jury trial of a detained defendant. Because of th at trial and other matters, it may have 
been weeks before I could have rescheduled the hearing for a time when all of the parties and the guardian ad litem 
were available. If the hearing had to be  delayed, I could not give the child ba ck to the Respondent because of the 
substantial risk that she would again take the child and flee, or be arrested on immigration charges. If the Petitioner 
(a factory worker) was forced by economi c necessity to return to Mexico, the child would ha ve to be placed in the 
custody of the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services which I hope to avoid. Under these difficult circumstances, I think that I had the discretion to deny the request for a continuance in the best interest of the child. 
I refused the request for a stay for the same reasons. If I had grante d a stay, there is a high probability that the child 
would have ended up in the custody of the Georgia Depa rtment of Family and Children Services. In addition, 
denying the request for a stay only means that the Respondent has to go back to Mexico to adjudicate her custody 
rights to the child in the courts of that country. Balancing the hardships to the parties and considering the best 
interest of the child, it seemed to me that the request for a stay should be denied. 
SO ORDERED.

2004  WL 1895123  (11th  Cir.(Ga.))  
United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. 
Isaac ROBLES ANTONIO, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v. 
Josefina BARRIOS BELLO, Defendant-Appellant. 
No. 04-12794-GG.  
June 10, 2004. 
On Appeal from the United States District Co urt for the Northern District of Georgia. 
William A. Clineburg, Jr. , Thomas Edward Vanderbloemen , King & Spalding, Atlanta, GA, for Appellant. 
James F. Bogan, III , Kilpatrick Stockton, Atlanta, GA, for Appellee. 
Before HULL , MARCUS  and PRYOR , Circuit Judges. 
BY THE COURT: PER CURIAM. 
*1 The Appellant, Josefina Barrios Bello, has filed with this Court an Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal 
from a Judgment of the United States Dist rict Court for the Northern District of Georgia--entered on June 4, 2004 
after an evidentiary hearing on that same day--gra nting the Verified Complaint/Petition Under the Hague 
Convention for Return of a Child (Itzel Ameyalli Robles Barrios) to Mexico, filed by  Appellee, Isaac Robles 
Antonio. Also in her Emergency Motion, Appellant states that on June 4, 2004, the district court denied her Motion to Stay the Order granting the relief requested in the Verified Complaint/Petition. Appellant has also filed a 
Consolidated Motion for leave to file a supplemental brief to her Emergency Motion for Stay and leave to file a 
reply brief to Appellee’s Response to the Emergency Motion for Stay. 
On June 4, 2004, this Court entered an Order that temporarily granted Appellant’s Motion for Stay and temporarily 
enjoined the removal of the child from the jurisdiction of the United States District Court of the Northern District of 
Georgia. Also in that Order, we dir ected the Court Reporter to transcribe, and Appellant’s counsel to furnish this 
Court with a transcript of the June 4, 2004 hearing in the district court. We further ordered Appellant’s counsel to 
furnish copies of any exhibits which we re filed and received in evidence by th e District Court at the aforementioned 
hearing and the Clerk of the United States District Court to  file with this Court any materials filed under seal or 
received in camera  by the District Court. 
After thorough review of the foregoing materials, as  well as careful considera tion of the parties’ written 
submissions, we now VACATE our June 4, 2004 Order and DENY Appellant’s Motion for Stay Pending Appeal. 
We GRANT IN PART Appellant’s Consolidated Motion. We grant Appellant leave to file the supplemental brief 
she filed with the Consolidated Motion and deny Appe llant leave to file a reply to Appellee’s Response. 
The grant of an emergency motion to stay a district cour t’s order is an exceptional remedy, which will be granted 
only upon a showing that: (1) the movant is likely to prevail on the merits on appeal; (2) absent a stay, the movant 
will suffer irreparable damage; (3) the non-movant will suffer no substantial ha rm from the issuance of the stay; and 
(4) the public interest will be served by issuing the stay. Garcia-Mir  v. Meese,
 781 F.2d 1450, 1453 (11th Cir.1986) . 
Ordinarily, the first factor is the most important and, in order to find a likelihood of success on the merits, we must 
find that the district court’s decision was clear ly erroneous. See id. Absent being able to establish the first factor, a 
movant for emergency stay relief must establish that the th ree remaining factors for stay relief, the “equities,” tend 
strongly in her favor. See id. at 1454; see also Gonzalez  v. Reno,  2000 WL 381901, *1 (11th Cir. Apr.19, 2000) . NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page G-9  
 
 *2 In his petition brought under the Internati onal Child Abduction Remedies Act (“ICARA”), 42 U.S.C. § 11601  et 
seq., [FN1]  Appellee, a citizen of Mexico, alleged that Appellant, also a citizen of Mexico, had wrongfully removed 
their seven-year-old daughter, without his acquiescence or consent, from their family home in Mexico. Pursuant to 
ICARA, Appellee requested that the child be returned to Me xico for a determination of her custody there, where the 
parties are currently underg oing divorce proceedings. 
FN1.  In 1980, Congress enacted ICARA to implement the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction, 19 I.L.M. 1501 (1980) , a treaty to which the United States and Mexico are 
signatories. See 42 U.S.C. § 11601(b)(1) . 
The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on th e petition at which both partie s testified. The court also 
appointed a guardian  ad litem  who interviewed the child, Appellant, and Appellee, and made a report and 
recommendation to the court. Based on the parties’ testimony, the recommendation of the guardian  ad litem,  [FN2] 
and documentary evidence, the district co urt found the following: (1) since her birth, the child, Itzel, has lived with 
both parents at their familial home in Mexico; (2) on November 29, 2003, Appellant wrongfully removed Itzel from 
her home and habitual residence in Mexico and brought both the child and herself to the United States illegally; (3) 
prior to Itzel’s removal, Appellant and Appellee had joint legal and physical custody of Itzel under Mexican law; and (4) Itzel’s removal breached Appellee’s custody rights under Mexican law, which rights Appellee had exercised 
at the time of the child’s removal. 
FN2.
 The guardian  ad litem  specifically recommended that the ch ild be returned to Mexico for the 
determination of custody, especially since the child is in this country illegally. In the guardian  ad litem’  s 
opinion, based on her interviews with both parties and Itzel, there was no physical or psychological danger 
to Itzel if she was returned to Me xico in the custody of her father. 
Based on these factual findings, the district court conc luded a court in Mexico was the appropriate venue to 
determine whether Appellant or Appellee should have custody of Itzel. [FN3]  Thus, the district court granted 
Appellee’s Petition and ordered that Itzel be returned to Mexico by her father pending a custody determination by the courts of Mexico. 
FN3.
 The court noted that Appellant had testified at the hearing that she had been physically abused by 
Appellee during their marriage, but had made no clai m and presented no evidence that Appellee had ever 
harmed Itzel. From our de novo  review of the record, we also have found no such evidence or claim. 
In reviewing a district court’s order on an ICARA petition, we review a district court’s findings of fact for clear 
error and its conclusions of law de novo.  See Lops  v. Lops,  362 F.3d 702, 710 (11th Cir.2004) .534 
The district court also denied Appellant’s motion for a stay of the Order granting ICARA relief. In its order denying 
a stay, the court observed that “[t]here was no testimony  that the Petitioner had ever abused or mistreated the 
child.... It is undisputed that the respondent smuggled herself and the child from Mexico into this country and they 
are living here illegally. It is undisputed that she did th at in violation of petitioner’s custody rights under Mexican 
law.” The district court further explained that it had denied Appellant’s prior request to continue the hearing and her motion for stay of the Order granting Appellee’s IC ARA petition based on the following considerations, inter  alia:  
(1) if the hearing was postponed and Appellant given temporary custody, the court was concerned that Appellant 
might again flee with Itzel and leave the court’s jurisdiction; (2) if Appellee had to return to Mexico prior to the re-scheduled hearing, since Appellant was subject to deportati on based on her illegal status, there was the real prospect 
that Itzel would have to be placed in the care of Georgia Department of Family  and Children Services; and (3) denial 
of the stay meant only that Appellant must return to Mexi co to adjudicate her parental rights there. We can find no 
abuse of discretion in the district co urt’s denial of a continuance based on the reasons enumerated by the district 
court in its Order denying appellant’s Motion for a Stay. See United  States  v. Bowe,
 221 F.3d 1183, 1189 (11th 
Cir.2000)  (reviewing district court’s decision on motion to continue trial for abuse of discretion; observing that 
district court enjoys “broad discretion” in deciding such motions). 
                                                 
534 Note that the Court’s reference to Lops v. Lops was apparently incorrect and should have been to 
Furnes v. Reeves , which appears at 362 F.3d 702. NCMEC  TRAINING MANUAL  Page G-10  
 
 *3 In denying Appellant’s motion for a stay pending appeal, the district court concluded that Appellant’s “likelihood 
of success on appeal was low.” We ag ree. As we recently outlined in Furnes  v. Reeves,  362 F.3d 702, 712 (11th 
Cir.2004) , to state an ICARA violation based on the wrongful removal or retention of a child, a petitioner must show 
by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the child has been removed or retained in violation of the petitioner’s rights of custody, and (2) “at the time of removal or reten tion those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or 
alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.” Id.
 (citation omitted). In the district court, 
it was undisputed that these two factors were met. Moreover, Appellant could not show that one of the recognized 
affirmative defenses to an ICARA violation applied. This conclusion was also based, in large part, on undisputed 
facts. See id. (outlining these defenses). On this record, we can find no error in the district court’s conclusion that 
Appellant’s likelihood of success on the merits of her ap peal from the grant of Appellee’s ICARA petition is “low.” 
Moreover, the Appellant has also failed to establish that th e other three factors for stay relief (the “equities”) tend 
strongly in her favor. See Garcia-Mir,  781 F.2d at 1454 . Again, these factors consider whether denial of the stay will 
result in irreparable damage to the movant, whether grant of the stay will cause substantial harm to the non-movant, 
and whether the public interest will be served by issuing the stay. See id. at 1453.  As for irreparable harm to the 
Appellant, the district court found that denial of the stay meant only that the Appellant, who is here illegally and is subject to deportation in any event, has to go back to Me xico to adjudicate her custod y rights to the child in the 
courts of that country. [FN4]
 Moreover, on the harm to Appellee, the distri ct court found that if a stay was entered, 
Appellee (a factory worker in Mexico) may be forced by ec onomic necessity to return to work and Itzel could then 
be placed in state protective custody. Finally, the district court noted the public interest would not be served by 
placing Itzel in state protective custody. The return order also furthers the public interest in complying with this 
country’s treaty obligations, as implemented by ICARA, and in doing so expeditiously. [FN5]  
FN4.  The irreparable harm from not granting a stay is not, as Appellant suggests, that she will lose her 
child. The return order does not effect any change in custody since Appellant is free to accompany Itzel 
back to Mexico and assert her custody rights there. See Furnes,  362 F.3d at 717 . 
FN5.  One of the stated purposes of the Hague Convention is “ ‘to establish procedures to ensure [that 
children wrongfully removed are] prompt[ly] return[ed] to the State of their habitual residence.” ‘ Furnes,  
362 F.3d at 716 (citation omitted). 
We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in its factual findings. Moreover, based on our de novo  review of 
the entire record, we also conclude that Appellant is not entitled to the exceptional remedy of an emergency stay. 
Should the child be removed from the jurisdiction of this Co urt while the appeal is pending, Appellee’s counsel shall 
advise this Court and file any appropriate motions. See Bekier  v. Bekier,  248 F.3d 1051 (11th Cir.2001) .
