TheIstanbul Protocol outlines international legalstandards on protection against torture and sets out specific principles and guidelineson how effective legal and clinical investigations into allegations of tortureand ill treatment should be conducted.The Istanbul Protocol became an official United Nations document in 1999 and has been recognized by a number of human rights bodies, including the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the UN Committee Against Torture, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, and regional human rights bodies. In his annual report to the UN General Assembly in October 2014, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Méndez, recognized the critical role of forensic and medical sciences in the investigation and prevention of torture and other ill-treatment. “The Istanbul Protocol serves as a standard for medical evidence given by experts, for benchmarking the effectiveness of the evidence, and for establishing redress for victims,” he said. “Quality forensic reports are revolutionizing investigations of torture.” Such recognition represents a significant factor in the widespread use and acceptance of the Istanbul Protocol and its standards in medical-legal and other contexts worldwide.The Istanbul Protocolhas been routinely used by state and non-state actors to guide theirinvestigations into torture and ill-treatment. The Protocol is now translatedinto more than 20 languages, and many countries as well as intergovernmentalbodies have taken steps to incorporate it into their legal or policyframeworks.Torture and otherforms of ill-treatment are heinous crimes committed by state officials that areoften concealed to effectively preclude justice, accountability, and redress.The Istanbul Protocol is a tool that empowers civil society to prevent tortureand ill-treatment, hold perpetrators accountable, and afford victims theredress and rehabilitation that they deserve. The strength of the IstanbulProtocol lies in the global consensus that it represents and the power of the medical-legalevidence that it employs.Duringthe past two years, representativesof four civil society organizations (Physicians for Human Rights, theInternational Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, the Human RightsFoundation of Turkey, and REDRESS) and the four principal UN anti-torturebodies (the UN Committee against Torture, the UN Subcommittee for thePrevention of Torture, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, and the UNVoluntary Fund for Victims of Torture) have led a large-scale project to strengthen the Istanbul Protocol involving morethan 180 experts in 51 countries. The 2020 edition of the Protocol will include updates and clarifications that address the role of health professionalsin different documentation contexts and provide guidance to states on implementationof the Istanbul Protocol.The 2020 edition of the Istanbul Protocol will include updates and clarifications that address the role of health professionals in different documentation contexts and provide guidance to states on implementation of the Istanbul Protocol.On this solemn day of support for victims oftorture, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has announcedher unequivocal support for the Istanbul Protocol and the plan to publish anupdated and strengthened 2020 edition of the document.We at PHR are proud to be among the many participantsin this extraordinary effort to take critical action in support of victims oftorture to ensure the most fundamental right of all people – to live in a worldwithout torture.Photo by Robert LisakAuthorsVincent Iacopino, MD, PhDAdjunct Professor of Medicine with the University of Minnesota Medical SchoolRelatedWebinarNext Steps for the Global Anti-Torture Movement: Istanbul Protocol 2022Press ReleaseAnti-Torture Experts Launch updated ‘Istanbul Protocol,’ the New Global Standards for Investigation and Documentation of TortureReport“Part of my heart was torn away”: What the U.S. Government Owes the Tortured Survivors of Family SeparationDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
