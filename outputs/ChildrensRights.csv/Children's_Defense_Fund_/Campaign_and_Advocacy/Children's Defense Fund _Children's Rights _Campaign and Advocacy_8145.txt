My most authentic answer (which some found insufficient) was, “I don’t have a vision. Right now, I’m working to get a view.”What I needed was the time, opportunity, and ability to see — the state of our movement and institution at a moment in time. With a clear view, I would be able to develop an informed opinion (or point of view). At best, I had a sense of our call. Vision becomes clear as one gains perspective and sight. Vision is shaped through discernment in community. Vision is OURS, not mine. So, I’m grateful for the time members of this community invested over the last year to discern a collective vision and develop our organizational strategy.The Children’s Defense Fund envisions a nation where marginalized children flourish, leaders prioritize their well-being, and communities wield the power to ensure they thrive.The Board clarified organizational direction. Partners and stakeholders gave interviews and important perspective. The staff team completed assessments and recommendations through task forces on culture, operational efficiency, and program strategy. Facilitators, consultants, and subject matter researchers guided us through the journey. Every person lived the wisdom to “keep the baby in the center of the table.” Thank you.The following pages reflect our collective vision and strategy for the coming years. To realize our vision, we will pursue a movement-building and institutional growth strategy to build power for child-centered public policy, informed by racial equity and the lived experience of children and youth. This three-year evolution will complement CDF’s well-regarded public policy legacy and leverage milestones of the 25th anniversary of CDF Freedom Schools® marked in 2020, the 30th anniversary of the Black Community Crusade for Children in 2021, and CDF’s 50th anniversary in 2023.I hope this gives you a view of how we work for 74 million children and youth across the country…and you can see yourself in the plan.For our children,Rev.
