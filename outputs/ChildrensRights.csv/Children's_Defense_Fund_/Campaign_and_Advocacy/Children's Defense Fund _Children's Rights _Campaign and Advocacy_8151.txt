Children’s early experiences and environments build the foundation for future health, education and life outcomes. Unfortunately, the odds are stacked against the more than 3.6 million children under 6 living in poverty who too often face unsafe and stressful environments that can damage or delay their development. While high-quality early childhood programs can play an important role in buffering the negative impacts of early childhood poverty, too few poor children have access to affordable, high-quality opportunities.Early Head Start served less than 8% of eligible infants and toddlers in 2019Only 34% of 4-year-olds were enrolled in state-funded preschool programs during the 2018-2019 school yearCenter-based infant care costs more than public college tuition in 28 states and DC in 2019Our VisionWe envision an America where every child regardless of race, gender or family income has access to a continuum of high-quality, comprehensive early childhood opportunities that meet their needs and the needs of their families. Providing every child this Head Start with the help of caring families and communities is necessary to guarantee a successful passage to adulthood.The SolutionWe work with policymakers and community leaders to ensure every child a high-quality, early childhood education that builds a strong developmental foundation for the rest of their lives. To ensure all children a head start, we must build a high-quality continuum of early childhood opportunities for every child, including:Paid Family Leave so families welcoming a new child into their homes can bond with and support that child’s development before they have to return to work.Voluntary Home Visiting so new parents can understand the supports and resources available to them.Quality, Affordable Child Care so children’s development can be nurtured while their parents are at work.Early Head Start and Head Start for the poorest children and families so that their early needs can be met in a comprehensive way.Quality Preschool so children enter school ready to learn.Full-Day Kindergarten so children do not miss the critical step between preschool and first grade.Jump to a Policy:SelectChild PovertyHealthEarly ChildhoodEducationChild WelfareYouth JusticeGun Violence PreventionThe ProblemOur VisionThe SolutionRecent BlogsNational Paid Family and Medical Leave is an Important Promise to ChildrenNovember 18th, 2021Being there isn’t negotiable. National paid family and medical leave is one building block in a stack of policies, including the Child Tax Credit and high-quality, affordable child care, that create a solid foundation for children to grow and thrive. Congress must raise the pillars of stronger, better, and more inclusive national paid family and medical leave in Build Back Better–and beyond.What the Build Back Better Compromise Means for Children and FamiliesNovember 2nd, 2021The compromise bill includes important generational investments to boost families’ economic stability and reduce racial inequities in income, housing, education, and health care that disproportionately harm Black, Latino, and Indigenous children. However, it leaves out important investments to ensure children and families have what they need to thrive.What President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Means for Our Nation’s Children and FamiliesJune 4th, 2021President Biden recently released his Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Budget request to Congress to strengthen the economy, address longstanding racial disparities, and ensure a more equitable future for our children. After a year marked by such dramatic change and drastic negative impact on children’s lives, we need meaningful investments in supports for children and families. President Biden’s FY22 budget request starts to do just that.What’s NewLearn MoreTake ActionExplore Our Policy PrioritiesChild PovertyChild HealthEducationChild WelfareEarly Childhood DevelopmentYouth JusticeGun Violence PreventionYour support mattersA gift today helps children get the help they needDonate NowAbout UsPolicy PrioritiesCareersRequests for ProposalsInternshipsFinancial ReportsTransparency in Coverage RuleContact UsSupport UsDonate NowStoreCDF Freedom Schools® ShopResourcesReportsPress ReleasesJoin Our Email ListSPEAKER REQUEST FORMSStarsky WilsonState OfficesCaliforniaMinnesotaNew YorkOhioSouthern Regional OfficeTexasThe Children’s Defense Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
