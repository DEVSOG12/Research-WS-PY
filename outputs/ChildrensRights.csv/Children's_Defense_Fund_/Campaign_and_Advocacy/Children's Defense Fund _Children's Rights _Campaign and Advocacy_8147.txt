States Must Ensure These Children Don’t Lose Coverage.February 25th, 2022Any gaps in health coverage are harmful for children and their families. Our partners at Georgetown University Center for Children and Families (CCF) just released a new report with strategies for states to ensure children don’t lose coverage when the Medicaid continuous coverage requirement ends.National Paid Family and Medical Leave is an Important Promise to ChildrenNovember 18th, 2021Being there isn’t negotiable. National paid family and medical leave is one building block in a stack of policies, including the Child Tax Credit and high-quality, affordable child care, that create a solid foundation for children to grow and thrive. Congress must raise the pillars of stronger, better, and more inclusive national paid family and medical leave in Build Back Better–and beyond.Sound the Alarm for KidsNovember 17th, 2021Children’s emotional and behavioral health was a concern even before the pandemic, but the ongoing public health emergency has made a bad situation worse.
