New York and North Carolina are the only two states in the nation that continue to treat 16- and 17-year-old youths as adults.“On this day of remembrance of Martin Luther King, Jr. — I commend New York State, Governor Cuomo and the Commission for proposing a package of reforms that bends toward justice for children and youths by treating them as children and youths and ensuring that they have the chance to turn their lives around and become productive citizens,” said Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children’s Defense Fund. “The Governor and state Legislature now have the opportunity to enact this long-overdue proposal, which would make New York State a leader in juvenile justice.”###The Children’s Defense Fund Leave No Child Behind® mission is to ensure every child a Healthy Start, a Head Start, a Fair Start, a Safe Start and a Moral Startin life and successful passage to adulthood with the help of caring families and communities.Your support mattersA gift today helps children get the help they needDonate NowAbout UsPolicy PrioritiesCareersRequests for ProposalsInternshipsFinancial ReportsTransparency in Coverage RuleContact UsSupport UsDonate NowStoreCDF Freedom Schools® ShopResourcesReportsPress ReleasesJoin Our Email ListSPEAKER REQUEST FORMSStarsky WilsonState OfficesCaliforniaMinnesotaNew YorkOhioSouthern Regional OfficeTexasThe Children’s Defense Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
