The administration has appealed a federal court’s rejection of its attempt to supplant legal protections for immigrant children in U.S. custody with new and problematic regulations. If the appeal is successful, the government would be able to detain families indefinitely.Any amount of time is too long for children to be held in a prison-like detention center. The research is crystal clear on this. Detention harms children’s healthy development and ability to learn. It compounds the trauma children and families have already suffered in their home countries and causes physical and mental harm that can follow children throughout their path to adulthood and beyond.What’s more, the family detention setting undermines the parent-child relationship by stripping parents of their agency to make decisions about their children’s care. From decisions related to diet and feeding to medical care and education, parents’ caregiving must take a backseat to DHS authority.There is no safe way to detain children and families. This administration’s attempt to expand family detention is dangerous, and the Children’s Defense Fund will continue to fight its cruelty.Read the full article here.Mina Dixon Davis2020-03-03T10:43:17-05:00December 16th, 2019|Your support mattersA gift today helps children get the help they needDonate NowAbout UsPolicy PrioritiesCareersRequests for ProposalsInternshipsFinancial ReportsTransparency in Coverage RuleContact UsSupport UsDonate NowStoreCDF Freedom Schools® ShopResourcesReportsPress ReleasesJoin Our Email ListSPEAKER REQUEST FORMSStarsky WilsonState OfficesCaliforniaMinnesotaNew YorkOhioSouthern Regional OfficeTexasThe Children’s Defense Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
