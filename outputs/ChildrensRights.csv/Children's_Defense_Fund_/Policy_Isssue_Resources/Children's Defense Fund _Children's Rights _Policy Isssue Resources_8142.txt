40+ Years of Vigilance  
 
March 2018   
 
Since 1973, the Children’s Defense Fund has convened and participated in many coalitions and worked 
with numerous organizations, policymakers and community networks to help build bipartisan support in 
enacting laws and policies that have helped millions of children escape poverty and receive needed 
health care, nutrition, Head Start and Early Head Start, child care, e ducation, special education, family 
support services, adoption assistance, protections for children in the child welfare and juvenile justice 
systems, and protection from gun violence. Children do not come in pieces and need a comprehensive 
quality continu um of care from birth to adulthood. Through careful research, public education, policy 
development, implementation and monitoring, and grassroots organizing we have tried to help build a 
national house, where every child is healthy, safe and educated, room  by room.
