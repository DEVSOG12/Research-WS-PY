Progress on child and teen gun  
deaths  has stalled  
 
December 12, 2014  
According to the most recent data from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention , 
progress made in reducing child and teen gun deaths in the second half of the 2000s ground to 
a near halt in 2011 and 2012. B etween 2006 and 2010, gun deaths of children and teens  ages 
0-19 decreased an average of 123 death s every year, for a total reduction of 490 fewer deaths 
in 2010, a 15 percent reduction . Since 2010, gun deaths in children a nd teens have decreased 
only by 18 deaths a year, an 85 percent reduction in the previous rate of decrease .  
 
 
 
Guns remain  the second leading cause of death among children and teens ages 1 -19 and 
the number one cause among Black children and teens.  
 Only motor vehicle accidents kill more children and teens every year. More than twice as 
many children and teens  die from guns than by drowning.  
 Overall, children and teens ages 1 -19 are 40 percent more likely to die in a car accident 
than from a gun injury. Black children and teens are more than twice as likely  to die from a 
gun as in a car accident.  
 
U.S. children and teens ar e 18 times more likely to die from a gun than their peers in 25 
other high -income countries.  
 U.S. children and teens made up 43 percent of all children and teens in these 26 countries 
but were 93 percent  of all children and teens killed by guns.  3,1843,0422,9472,7932,694 2,674 2,658

2  Gun death ra tes for children and teens in the U.S. were nearly four times higher than in 
Finland, the country with the next highest rate, more than 14 times higher than in France, 
and over 67 times higher than in the United Kingdom.  
A child or teen dies from a gun eve ry 3 hours and 18 minutes.  
 2,658 children and teens died from guns in the United States in 2012 , or one every 3 hours 
and 18 minutes.   
 The children and teens who died from guns in 2012 would fill nearly 133 classrooms of 20 
children.  
 More children and teen s died from guns every three days in 2012 than died in the Newtown 
massacre.  
 
Child and teen gun death rates remain  higher than in the early 1960s.  
 The risk of a child or teen dying from a gun now is 34  percent higher than in 1963, the 
earliest year of data available . 
 While Black childre n and teens have been disproportionately likely to die from guns since 
the early 1960s, over half the deaths since 1963 were among White children and teens . 
 Between 1963 and 2012, 61,433  Black children and teens were killed by guns  — nearly 18 
times the re corded lynchings of Black people of all ages in the 86 years from 1882 to 1968.  
 
Since 1963, over three times more children and teens died from guns on American soil 
than U.S. soldiers kille d in action in wars abroad.  
 171,933  children and teens died from guns on American soil between 1963 and 2012, while 
52,816  U.S. soldiers were killed in action in the Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq 
wars during that same period.  
 On average 3,4 39 children and teens  — 172 classrooms of 20 children  — were killed by 
guns every year  from 1963 to 2012.  
 
A child or teen is injured with a gun  every 3 5 minutes.  
 15,045  children and teens were injured by  guns in 201 3, or one every 35 minutes.  
 
Total gun deaths and injuries in 2010 cost the U.S. $174.1 billio n, or 1.15 percent of our 
gross domestic product.  
 The 105,177 gun deaths and injuries to children, teens and adults that occurred in 2010 cost 
the nation $8.4 billion in medical and other direct costs, $52.5 billion in lost productivity and 
lost wages, and  $113.3 billion in lost enjoyment of life.  
 
Black and  American Indian and Alaska Native children and te ens are disproportionately 
more likely to die from  a gun . 
 In 2012,  43 percent of gun deaths were among Black children and teens, although they 
were  only 14 percent of all children and teens.  
 Black children and teens were 4  times as likely to die from a gun  as White children and 
teens and 14 times as likely to die from a gun as Asian and Pacific Islander children and 
teens.  
 American Indian or Alaska N ative children and teens were nearly twice as likely to die from a 
gun as White children and teens, and 6 times as likely to die from a gun as Asian and 
Pacific Islander children.  
 American Indian and  Alaska Native children and teens were the most likely to  die from a gun 
suicide , followed by White children and teens.  
 
  
3 The U.S. has as many guns as people.  
 The U.S. accounts for less than 5 percent of the global population, but owns an estimated 
35 to 50 percent of all civilian -owned guns in the world.  
 The mos t recent estimate of U.S. civilian gun ownership is as high as 310 million, about one 
gun per person. In contrast, U.S. military and law enforcement agencies possess 4 million 
guns.  
 American companies manufacture enough bullets each year to fire 31 rounds into every one 
of our citizens.  
 
A gun in the home increases the risk of homicide, suicide and accidental death.  
 A gun in the home makes the likelihood of homicide three times higher, suicide three to five 
times higher, and accidental death four times high er. For every time a gun in the home 
injures or kills in self -defense, there are 11 completed and attempted gun suicides, seven 
criminal assaults and homicides with a gun, and four unintentional shooting deaths or 
injuries.  
 More than half of youth who comm itted suicide with a gun obtained the gun from their home, 
usually a parent’s gun.
