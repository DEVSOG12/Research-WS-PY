  Children’s Defense FundABOUT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND
The Children’s Defense Fund envisions a nation where marginalized children flourish, leaders 
prioritize their well-being and communities wield the power to assure they thrive. To realize this 
vision, we pursue a movement-building and institutional growth strategy to build power for child-
centered public policy, informed by racial equity and the lived experience of children and youth.
Our Leave No Child Behind® mission is to ensure every child a Healthy Start , a Head Start , a Fair 
Start , a Safe Start  and a Moral Start  in life and successful passage to adulthood with the help of 
caring families and communities.
We serve and advocate for the largest, most diverse generation in America: the 73 million children 
and youth under the age of 18 and 30 million young adults under the age of 25, with particular 
attention to those living in poverty and communities of color.

The State of America’s Children® 2021iiiA Note about Using  
The State of America’s Children® 2021
The Children’s Defense Fund fights for the largest, most diverse generation in America. We know that 
to succeed, children need stable homes, quality health care, ample nutritious food, good schools, safe 
neighborhoods, and access to resources and opportunities that enable them to reach their potential. 
But the fact is that for too many of our children, these basic building blocks for success are out of reach. 
As we urge policymakers to prioritize child-centered solutions that create equitable conditions in which 
all young people can thrive, our work must be grounded in data and facts. As our children continue to 
suffer from the harmful impacts of our country’s health, economic, and racial disparities, which are now 
magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges facing our young people are more daunting in 
every area. 
This year’s State of America’s Children® report is unique in that the majority of the data included in the 
report reflect realities prior to the pandemic. The report is undergirded by specific data that were vital in 
reducing child poverty and taking other steps towards improving child well-being  before  the devastation 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while also reflecting the deep racial and economic disparities that 
have long plagued our nation. To bridge the gap between the available data and current realities, each 
chapter includes a special section highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 public health and economic 
crisis on children. Taken as a whole, the report underscores the need for government data reporting 
agencies and other organizations to conduct more real-time data collection, reporting, and information 
dissemination if we as a nation are to meet the challenges facing our children and families. Throughout 
the report terms of race, identity, and experience reflect the original data source’s language. This means 
from chapter to chapter, language usage may vary depending on the source of the data.
The State of America’s Children® 2021 and corresponding state fact sheets provide an overview of 
how America’s children are faring to inform conversations and improve policies to ensure no child is 
left behind. 
•   The State of America’s Children® 2021 summarizes the status of America’s children in 12 areas: child 
population, child poverty, income and wealth inequality, housing and homelessness, child hunger 
and nutrition, child health, early childhood, education, child welfare, youth justice, gun violence and 
immigration. For each area, we compiled the most recent, available national and state-level data. 
The report includes key findings as well as data tables, which are useful for comparing how children 
are faring in different states.
•   Using data from the tables in The State of America’s Children® 2021, our national and state 
factsheets each provide a one-page summary of how children are doing in all 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, and nationwide. Whether you identify as a teacher, child advocate, policymaker, policy 
wonk, college professor, faith leader, parent or grandparent, a millennial eager to make life better 
for your younger siblings, or a member of the media, we ask you to use The State of America’s 
Children® 2021 to inform your conversations and effectively make the case for policies, programs, 
and strategies to improve the odds for children in your state and nationwide. We must keep 
moving forward in the fight for America’s children.1

INEQUALITYINTRODUCTION
The year since the last publication of the Children’s Defense Fund’s State of America’s Children  report 
has felt more like a decade. Consequential changes in the nation’s health, wealth, and leadership have 
occurred in ways that make the whole world seem different.
Shortly after last year’s release, we were forced to respond to the most significant health pandemic in a 
century, which has now taken more than 500,000 American lives. The advent of COVID-19 initiated an 
economic crisis and restructuring from Wall Street to each of our homes. Shelter-in-place orders, mask 
mandates, and mandatory shifts to telecommuting have altered whole industries and impacted the trajectory 
of the future of work.
Meanwhile, last summer brought with it a racial reckoning years in the making. The largest mass mobilization 
for social justice in recent memory occurred as a historic presidential campaign took shape. More than 155 
million citizens voted in an atmosphere infused with white nationalism and culminating in an attempted siege 
of the U.S. Capitol. The protracted struggle for democracy led to a change in partisan control of the federal 
government and a first in executive leadership for women, Black, and South Asian Americans.  
Every aspect of American life in the social sector has been impacted by these shifts more quickly than data can 
track; even the most recent available data sets do not fully encompass how this past year has shaped our lives. 
This, of course, includes our 2021 State of America’s Children  report. Because, as one element of the report 
makes clear “Our Children are Not Immune.”
Young People are Not Immune
Children are being impacted at every level: physically, economically, academically, socially, and psychologically.  
As we consider child well-being in this country, this year’s report gives special attention to the various impacts of  
the pandemic. 
•   As of February 25, 2021, 3,168,274 total child COVID-19 cases had been reported, representing  
13.1 percent of all cases.
•   October 2020 data analysis by the Center on Poverty & Social Policy (CPSP) at Columbia University 
showed that an additional 8 million Americans—including 2.5 million children—have fallen into  
poverty since May 2020.
•   As of February 2021, more than 1 in 7 adults with children (14.5 percent) reported that their children  
were not getting enough to eat—more than five times the pre-pandemic rate.
Chief among concerns more difficult to measure and monitor are the impacts on how our children are 
processing this dramatic change. But a  November 2020 report  from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) paints an important picture. By examining emergency room visits for mental health, the  
CDC found increases of between 24 and 31 percent for people under the age of eighteen, compared to the same 
period in 2019. Unfortunately, policies regarding reimbursement for services, coverage inequities, and cultural 
stigma have contributed to emergency departments being the frontline of support for children’s mental health.
While more than 3 million children and youth have contracted the novel coronavirus in the United States, 
all 73 million are impacted by the sense of uncertainty and disruption of routine it has caused. Even the 
improvements in the second school year of online learning have not resolved concerns of social isolation and 
the loss of important life milestones, like graduation and the high school prom. This loss of certainty, consistent 
routine, and connection is leading to increased levels of depression and despair among our children and youth.INTRODUCTION

Black youth are especially vulnerable to 2020’s converging crises. COVID-19 and racial uprisings swept into 
Black communities wrestling with spiking child suicide rates. In December 2019, the Congressional Black 
Caucus’s Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health released Ring the Alarm . The report 
found that Black youth under 13 are twice as likely to die by suicide than their white counterparts and the 
suicide death rate for Black youth is increasing faster than any other racial or ethnic group. 
Time for Healing, Imagination, and Action
A year marked by such dramatic change and drastic negative impact on children’s lives must be followed 
by one of healing and restoration. This healing will require disciplined reflection, radical imagination, and 
bold action. Throughout the tumult of 2020, two of my most valued thought partners were the late writer 
and activist James Baldwin (with whom I share a deep intellectual resonance and a birthday) and Princeton 
professor Dr. Eddie Glaude, Jr.
Glaude reflected powerfully on “Jimmy’s” life in his 2020 book, Begin Again: James Baldwin’s America and 
Its Urgent Lessons for our Own . A revelation of critical import to me is Glaude’s highlighting Baldwin’s insight 
that times of reckoning and crisis call us to “do our first works over.” This is an invitation to re-examine our 
foundational commitments, values, and stories to faithfully craft a future.
The Children’s Defense Fund is walking this path of examination. The board and staff entered the year in 
discernment about the first leadership transition in our history. After having made the decision, we initiated 
a process of organizational, programmatic, and operational planning holding our “first works” and children’s 
needs in conversation.
As a result, even in what President Biden has called a “dark winter” considering the pandemic, the Children’s 
Defense Fund envisions a nation where marginalized children flourish, leaders prioritize their well-being, 
and communities wield the power to ensure they thrive . From where we currently stand, this is a radical 
vision. Yet, we are committed to work – with you – to make it happen.
Join us. Allow this data, compiled by our extraordinary public policy team, to inform your disciplined reflection. 
But don’t stop there. Pause and imagine a country where flourishing children smile, sing, and dance. Talk to 
young people about what they desire for their lives. Then gather your neighbors, friends, and colleagues to 
work together and improve the state of America’s children. We will be with you every step of the way.
  
 For our children,

INCOME AND WEALTH  
INEQUALITY  Children’s Defense Fund6OVERVIEW
CHILD POPULATION: America’s children are more diverse than ever.  
•   There were 73 million children in the U.S. in 2019—22 percent of our nation’s population. 
•   In 2019, children of color made up 49.8 percent of all children and the majority of children under 5. 
CHILD POVERTY: Children remain the poorest age group in America, with children of color and 
young children suffering the highest poverty rates.
•   Nearly 1 in 7 children—10.5 million—were poor in 2019. Nearly 71 percent of poor children were children of 
color. More than 1 in 4 Black children and more than 1 in 5 Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native children were poor compared with 1 in 12 white children.
•   The youngest children are the poorest. Nearly 1 in 6 children under 6 were poor and almost half lived in extreme poverty below half the poverty line. 
INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY: Income and wealth inequality are growing and harming 
children in low-income, Black and Brown families.
•   The share of all wealth held by the top one percent of Americans grew from 30 to 37 percent and the share held by the bottom 90 percent fell from 33 to 23 percent between 1989 and 2019.
•   Today, a member of the top 10 percent of income earners makes about 39 times as much as the average earner in the bottom 90 percent.
•   In 2019, the median family income of white households with children ($95,700) was more than double that of Black ($43,900), and Hispanic households with children ($52,300).
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS: The lack of affordable housing and federal rental assistance 
leaves millions of children homeless or at risk of homelessness.
•   More than 1 in 3 children live in households burdened by housing costs, meaning more than 30 percent of their family income goes toward housing.
•
   More than 1.5 million children enrolled in public schools experienced homelessness during the 2017-2018 school year.
•
   74 percent of unhoused students during the 2017-2018 school year were living temporarily with family  
or friends.
CHILD HUNGER AND NUTRITION:  Millions of children live in food-insecure households, lacking 
reliable access to safe, sufficient, and nutritious food.
•   More than 1 in 7 children—10.7 million—were food insecure, meaning they lived in households where not everyone had enough to eat. Black and Hispanic children were twice as likely to live in food-insecure households as white children.
•
   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helped feed 17 million children in Fiscal Year 2018—nearly a quarter of all children in America.
•
   Half of all families that received SNAP in 2019 were not able to get enough healthy food, however, because SNAP benefits were too low. Among households with children, monthly SNAP benefits averaged just $118 a person—or less than $4 a day.The State of America’s Children® 2021OVERVIEWINCOME AND WEALTH  
INEQUALITYINCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY 
The State of America’s Children® 2021 7OVERVIEW
CHILD HEALTH: Our children have lost the health coverage they need to survive and thrive at 
an alarming rate.
•   An estimated 4.4 million children under age 19, were uninsured—an increase of 320,000 more children 
without health insurance since 2018.
•   Disparities in health insurance coverage persist. The rates of uninsured children are especially high 
among Hispanic children, undocumented children, children living in the South, and children in families 
with lower incomes.
•   Medicaid and CHIP are the foundation of the nation's health insurance system for children. In 2019, 
nearly 36 million children under 19 received comprehensive, pediatric-appropriate and affordable health 
coverage through Medicaid and CHIP. 
EARLY CHILDHOOD:  The high cost of child care and lack of early childhood investments leaves 
many children without quality care during critical years of brain development.
•   Center-based child care for an infant cost more than public college tuition in 28 states and the District of 
Columbia in 2019. More than 80 percent of two-child families were paying more for child care than for rent.
•   During the 2018-2019 school year, only 34 percent of 4-year-olds and 6 percent of 3-year-olds were 
enrolled in a state-funded preschool program.
EDUCATION: America’s schools continue to slip backwards into patterns of deep racial and 
socioeconomic segregation, perpetuating achievement gaps.
•   During the 2017-2018 school year, 19 percent of Black, 21 percent of Hispanic, and more than 26 percent 
of American Indian/Alaska Native public school students did not graduate on time compared with only 11 
percent of white students.
•   More than 77 percent of Hispanic and more than 79 percent of Black fourth and eighth grade public 
school students were not proficient in reading or math in 2019, compared with less than 60 percent of 
white students.
•   In 2017, 60 percent of Black children attended high-poverty schools with a high share of students of color 
while fewer than 9 percent of white children did.
CHILD WELFARE:  For the first time since 2012, the number of children in the child welfare 
system fell, but too many children wind up in foster care because of poverty. 
•   Black and American Indian/Alaska Native families are disproportionately impacted by the child welfare 
system. Nationally, Black and AI/AN children are represented in foster care at a rate 1.66 and 2.84 times 
their portion of the overall population, respectively.
•   After steadily declining since 2008, the number of children aging out of the foster care system jumped 
by more than 14 percent in 2019, with 20,445 youth reaching adulthood without a permanent family. 
YOUTH JUSTICE: A disproportionate number of children of color are incarcerated in the  
juvenile justice and/or adult criminal justice systems, placing them at risk of physical and 
psychological harm.
•   Despite a 67 percent reduction in child arrests between 2009 and 2019, 530,581 children were arrested in 
the U.S and a child or teen was arrested every 59 seconds. 
•   Black children were 2.4 times more likely to be arrested and American Indian children were 1.5 times 
more likely to be arrested than white children.OVERVIEW
•   Black youth represented less than 15 percent of the total youth population but 52 percent of youth 
prosecuted in adult criminal court in 2018. Black youth are nine times more likely than white youth to 
receive an adult prison sentence, American Indian/Alaska Native youth are almost two times more likely, 
and Hispanic youth are 40 percent more likely.
GUN VIOLENCE:  Child and teen gun deaths hit a 19-year high in 2017 and have remained 
elevated since.
•   Gun violence was the leading cause of death for children and teens ages 1-19 in 2018, surpassing motor 
vehicle accidents for the first time.
•   In 2019, 3,371 children and teens were killed with guns—one every 2 hours and 36 minutes.
•   Black children and teens had the highest gun death rate, followed by American Indian/Alaska Native 
children and teens. Black children and teens were 4 times more likely to die from gun violence than  
their white peers.
•   The United States has more guns than people—and nearly 1 in 5 are sold without background checks. 
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN:  Family separation and anti-immigrant policies are dangerous to 
children’s health, development, and well-being.
•   Nearly 1 in 4, approximately 18 million, U.S. children lived with at least one immigrant parent in 2018.
•   More than 1 in 4 immigrant children did not have health coverage in 2019, 25.5 percent compared to  
5.1 percent of native-born citizen children.
•   An estimated 6.9 million children lived with undocumented parents. Chronic uncertainty and distress 
about the threat of enforcement activity destroy children’s sense of safety and their mental health.

2020
In 2019, there were over 73 million children in the United States—making up 22 percent of our  
nation’s population.1 
The U.S.—and especially our youngest generation—is reaching a critical moment in racial and ethnic diversity. 
We need policies and programs that recognize and celebrate this growing diversity.
•     In 2019, children of color made up 49.8 percent of all children.
•     More than half of the 19.6 million children under five in America in 2019 were children of color.2
•     The majority of children under 18 were children of color in 14 states—Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, 
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Texas—
and the District of Columbia (see Table 1 ).
•     In 2019, 36.7 million children were white (50.2 percent); 18.7 million were Hispanic (25.6 percent); 10 million 
were Black (13.7 percent); 3.7 million were Asian (5.0 percent); 615,950 were American Indian/Alaska Native 
(<1 percent); and 147,057 were Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (<1 percent).3
•     Previous estimates suggest the majority of all U.S. children are children of color as of 2020 and the  
U.S. population will continue to become more racially and ethnically diverse.4
The U.S. is also graying and approaching a tipping point in age, with older adults set to outnumber children.
•     While the proportion of the population that is younger than 18 has been gradually decreasing  
(from 24.0 percent in 2010 and 22.3 percent in 2019), the proportion of the population that is 65 or  
older continues to steadily increase (from 13.1 percent in 2010 and 16.5 percent in 2019).5
•     Given current trends, it is expected that the share of seniors will continue to grow and there will be  
more seniors than children by 2040.6
•     We must prepare our nation to support its aging population, but also plan ahead to ensure our 
increasingly diverse child population is set from birth on a path to a productive and successful future 
with the foundation necessary to support future generations. 
Our current federal spending reflects our nation’s skewed priorities: Our children are our future but are not 
getting the investments they need to thrive.
•   Despite children making up such a large portion of our population, less than 7.5 percent of federal 
spending went towards children in FY2020.7 
•     Although Congress raised statutory caps on discretionary spending in FY2018-FY2020, children didn’t 
receive their fair share of those increases and children’s share of total federal spending has continued to 
decline between FY2016 and FY2020.8THE YEAR CHILDREN OF COLOR

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only disrupted the everyday lives of our children, it has also exacerbated our 
nation’s greatest moral disgrace: child poverty. Even before the pandemic, children, particularly children  
of color and very young children, were the poorest Americans. More than 10 million children—nearly 1 in 7  
(14.4 percent)—lived in poverty in 2019, the most recent year for which U.S. Census Poverty Data are available.1  
The child poverty rate is one-and-a-half times higher than that for adults ages 18-64 (9.4 percent) and adults 
65 and older (8.9 percent) (see Table 2 ). In 2019, a family of four was considered poor if their annual income fell 
below $26,172, which amounts to $2,181 a month, $503 a week, or less than $72 a day (see Table 3 ). Almost half 
of all children living in poverty lived in extreme poverty, which is defined as half the poverty threshold or an 
annual income of $13,086 for a family of four. 
Historical, systemic racism and institutional barriers mean that children of color have been particularly 
vulnerable to child poverty. Black and Hispanic children experience some of the highest poverty rates in  
the country, and 71 percent of children in poverty in 2019 were children of color.
•   Nearly 1 in 5 children of color in America (20.5 percent) were poor. Children of color were 2.5 times  
more likely to be poor than their white, non-Hispanic peers.2 
•   3.6 million children under six were living in poverty in 2019. Nearly 1 in 6 infants, toddlers, and 
preschoolers ages 0-5 were poor (15.4 percent).3
•   More than 1 in 4 Black children (26.5 percent) and 1 in 5 Hispanic children (20.8 percent) and American 
Indian/Alaska Native children (20.6 percent) were poor, compared with 1 in 12 white, non-Hispanic 
children (8.3 percent) and 1 in 14 Asian, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander children  
(7.7 percent) (see Tables 4-5 ).4
 Our youngest Americans are being hit hardest during their years of greatest development. 
•   Nearly 1 in 6 children under six were poor in 2019 and almost half of them lived in extreme poverty  
(see Table 6 ).
Children’s chances of being poor are also a result of the lottery of geography—with some states and regions 
having higher rates of poverty and inequality than others—as well as dramatic differences in services and 
support for children in families with low-incomes.
•   More than 25 percent of Black children were poor in 39 states and the District of Columbia in 2019; 
Hispanic children, in 22 states; and American Indian/Alaska Native children, in 24 states.
•   No states had white child poverty rates 20 percent or higher (see Table 6 ).
•   Black children are more likely than white children to live in states where benefits from Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the nation’s core cash assistance program, are lowest.5 State-
level decisions about benefit allocation and amounts are too often rooted in historical racism and have 
disparate impacts on Black families.6
This pandemic has exposed how unequal our pre-COVID economy was: families were working to take care of 
their children, but the unjust and unequal economy built by our political leaders was not working for them 
and left millions of children behind. More than two-thirds of poor children (70.1 percent) had at least one family 
member who worked in 2019, and more than one-third (33.7 percent) had at least one family member who 
worked full-time year-round.

We know what works when children and families are in financial crisis.7 Mountains of evidence show the 
benefit of government assistance programs,8 which help curb the negative effects poverty has on children, 
families, and the economy. Investing in children and their healthy development not only helps our economy, 
but helps reduce racial disparities and improve opportunities for children in the long run.
•   In 2019, more than four million children were lifted out of poverty with the help of the Child Tax Credit 
(CTC) and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); more than 1.4 million with Social Security; nearly 1 million 
with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); 763,000 with housing subsidies; 661,000 with 
the National School Lunch Program; 536,000 with the Supplemental Social Insurance (SSI); 160,000 with 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and general assistance; 133,00 with Unemployment 
Insurance and 127,000 with the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC).9
Child poverty and racial disparities will worsen if we do not continue to ensure relief for families and expand 
basic needs programs to help all children learn, grow, and thrive during this pandemic and beyond. Cash 
assistance, child allowances, rental and housing support, SNAP, and unemployment insurance are all relief 
measures that must be boosted in the short and long term to help families. 
Each September, the U.S. Census Bureau releases income, poverty, and health insurance statistics 
from the prior year. The official poverty estimates and poverty thresholds released by the Census 
Bureau inform important policy choices, yet they fail to fully and meaningfully capture who is 
experiencing poverty and what a family requires to survive and thrive in the 21st century economy. 
Additionally, as economic conditions have changed dramatically this year, the available data 
inadequately depicts the challenges that children and families are experiencing due to the impacts 
of COVID-19. Official Census Bureau measures of poverty are based on a family’s annual resources, 
which means this data is not only outdated, but creates a lag that makes it hard to spot trends in 
poverty or measure the impact of policy responses in real time. 
However, an October 2020 data analysis by the Center on Poverty & Social Policy (CPSP) at 
Columbia University monitored monthly  poverty estimates, which showed that an additional eight 
million Americans—including 2.5 million children—have fallen into poverty since May 2020.10  
The findings revealed that poverty rose beyond pre-COVID levels after Congress allowed COVID 
relief to expire. Although the stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits included in 
the CARES Act initially prevented a rise in poverty, keeping as many as 18 million Americans out 
of poverty in April and May of 2020, CPSP found much of this progress was reversed throughout 
the summer after cash assistance ended in June and the $600 weekly extra unemployment 
benefits expired in July.11 By September 2020, the poverty reduction impact of the relief legislation 
had fallen dramatically and poverty rates had risen among all groups, according to Columbia’s 
analysis.12 Columbia’s work underscores the importance of frequently updated data to inform wise 
policy choices, and a forthcoming February 2021 report will update the monthly poverty estimates 
at a crucial time when a new Congress and administration will be in place.
Advocates and policymakers need consistent, non-partisan, evidence-based, statistically and 
economically relevant and timely data on child poverty and family income to better respond to this 
economic crisis and protect children and families from harm. COVID-19 and the Need for Real-Time Data and Updated Measures of PovertyINCOME AND WEALTH  
INEQUALITY
INCOME AND WEALTH  
INEQUALITY
IN 2019 THE MEDIAN WHITE FAMILY HAD ALMOST
 EIGHT TIMES   MORE WEALTH THAN THE MEDIAN BLACK FAMILY AND
FIVE TIMES MORE THAN THE MEDIAN HISPANIC FAMILY.
A    family’s income is critical to ensuring basic needs are met for a child’s life. Income, which is the revenue a 
family receives, either from work or return on investment, helps a family put food on the table and keep 
a roof over their heads. Income inequality is the extent to which income is concentrated among the wealthiest 
few rather than shared equally among all earners. In the U.S., our economic rules have favored the rich at the 
expense of our communities’ well-being, especially communities of color. People are working harder than ever, 
but a powerful and wealthy few CEOs, corporations, and billionaires reap the benefits, raking in record profits 
off lower-income workers’ production while their families struggle to get by.
On the surface, data tells a rosy story about incomes in America; median household income grew by 4.5 
percent between 2018 and 2019 to $65,712, the highest level in history.1 But in recent decades, incomes have 
grown very quickly for the rich, and relatively slowly for everyone else. Since 1979, incomes for the top 1 percent 
of earners have grown by 261 percent, compared with only 49 percent for the middle 60 percent of earners.2 
These unequal growth rates have produced some astonishing present-day income disparities:
•   The top 20 percent of households earn, on average, about 14 times more than households in the bottom 
20 percent.3 In 1975, the average household income of the top 20 percent of Americans was 10 times that 
of the bottom 20 percent.4
•   A member of the top 10 percent of income earners makes about 39 times 
as much as the average earner in the bottom 90 percent; the average 
member of the richest 0.1 percent of the population earns about 196 
times more than an average earner in the bottom 90 percent.5
•   In 2019, the share of total income going to the top 10 percent was 
almost 50 percent and the share going to the top 1 percent was  
19 percent (see Figure 1 ).6
In short, incomes have exploded for the rich, while creeping up slowly for 
the vast majority of earners, a fact that has corrosive effects on the American 
Dream. Slow-growing family income means that economic mobility is on 
the decline and children born into low-income families may grow up to 
make less money than their parents.7
Income inequality contributes to another runaway economic problem: 
wealth inequality. Wealth or net worth refers to the total value of a person 
or family’s money, property, and other assets minus any debt they hold; 
wealth inequality is the disproportionate concentration of wealth among 
the richest few. Like income inequality, wealth inequality has increased for 
decades and reached levels not seen for almost a century. Today, wealth is 
even more concentrated than income.8
•   In 2019, compared to 1989, the share of wealth held by the top one 
percent of Americans grew from 30 to 37 percent of all wealth and 
the share held by the bottom 90 percent fell from 33 to 23 percent.9 
The top 10 percent of Americans owned more than 75 percent of all wealth in 2019 (see Figure 2 ).10
•   In total, the richest five percent own more than two-thirds of the country’s wealth. The richest one 
percent own more than half of the stock owned by private Americans, but hold just five percent of the 
same group’s debt.11

The State of America’s Children® 2021•   In 2018, the three richest men in the United States—Jeff Bezos,  
Bill Gates and Warren Buffet—held as much wealth as the entire 
bottom half of Americans.12
This is not by chance. For centuries, our nation’s policies have been 
intentionally constructed in a way that has disproportionately denied 
families with low incomes, especially families of color, the opportunity 
to build wealth. Racist housing policies, for example, led to differences 
in homeownership rates that today account for nearly one-third of the 
racial wealth gap.13 As a result of such policies, racial income and wealth 
inequality in our nation is staggering. For example: 
•   In 2019, the median income of Black ($43,900), Hispanic ($52,300), 
and American Indian ($48,000) families with children was about half the median income of white 
families with children ($95,700) (see Table 7 ).
•   For every $1 earned by the median white household in 2019, the median Black household only earned  
61 cents and the median Hispanic household, 74 cents.14
•   In 2019, the median net worth of white families ($188,200) was almost eight times more than Black 
families ($24,100) and five times more than Hispanic families ($36,100).15
•   Today’s median Black family owns $3,600—just 2 percent of the median white family’s wealth.  
The median Latino family owns $6,600—only 4 percent of that of the median white family.16 
•   The 400 richest people in the U.S. hold more wealth than every Black household plus a quarter  
of Hispanic households combined.17 
Inequality is a global phenomenon, but the U.S. does not fare well even when compared with other 
industrialized countries. In 2019, the U.S. held the largest share of the world’s wealth (nearly 30 percent).18 
Studies suggest, however, that the U.S. has the highest level of wealth inequality and one of the highest levels 
of income inequality among developed countries.19INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY

As the COVID-19 pandemic raged and millions of families lost jobs, a familiar pattern accelerated: the 
rich got richer, while everyone else suffered.
The pandemic, and the corresponding economic recession, hit low-income workers hardest with lost 
jobs, wages, and livelihoods. Low-income workers experienced the highest job loss rate during the 
pandemic, but comparatively few of the highest-income workers lost their jobs.20 In all, more than ten 
percent of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 lost their jobs during the pandemic.21 Over half of 
families with children experienced a job loss or loss of income during the pandemic, with those losses 
concentrated at the lower-end of the income distribution.22
While low-income workers were laid off at staggering rates, the wealthiest few saw their fortunes 
expand dramatically. According to an Institute for Policy Studies analysis, the combined wealth of 
all U.S. billionaires increased by more than $1 trillion between March and December 2020, from 
approximately $3 trillion to about $4 trillion.23 Elon Musk’s net worth increased by about $100 billion 
during the pandemic.24 Jeff Bezos’s fortune grew by about $70 trillion.25 Although the stock market, 
took an initial hit in the spring, it has since recovered and remains near an all-time high.
Racial inequality has continued to widen during the pandemic as well. Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous 
communities were more likely to get sick and die from COVID-19 in addition to having greater chances 
of becoming unemployed during the pandemic, despite being overrepresented among “essential 
workers.”26 As the economic recovery progressed, job and income losses for white people bounced 
back much more quickly than for Black or Hispanic people.27COVID-19 Made the Rich Even Richer and Widened InequalityHOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS
CHILDREN ENROLLED IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS EXPERIENCED 
HOMELESSNESS DURING THE 2017-2018 SCHOOL YEAR.
Having a safe, stable home is a basic need for all children. Homelessness, unstable housing, and the 
unavailability of affordable housing have dire consequences for children’s health, education, and future 
earning potential. Yet, the right to a decent, safe, and affordable home was out of reach even before the 
COVID-19 crisis for far too many children and families—but particularly for Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous 
families. Access to housing is a racial justice issue as families of color, especially Black families, are more likely 
to experience eviction, homelessness, and segregated housing and neighborhoods due to racist policies built 
deep into our housing system.
The affordable housing crisis has deep and racist roots, but stems largely from policymakers’ intentional 
divestment from affordable housing and rental assistance programs. 
•   Federal investment in housing was gutted in the 1970s and 80s and the number of unhoused children 
and families skyrocketed. The crisis deepened after the 2008 financial crisis as foreclosures forced  
9 million new families into the rental market.1
•   As more families sought affordable and safe rental housing, construction failed to keep pace with 
growing demand, and the new units built were mostly luxury units in big cities. Rents rose and  
working-class wages remained stagnant, leaving many families unable to find suitable housing.2
•   By 2020, rents were so high that a person working full-time, year-round at minimum wage could 
not afford the monthly Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom rental unit in any state or the District of 
Columbia and still have enough money for food, utilities, and other necessities.3 To afford this rent,  
a single person working full-time would have to make almost $24 an hour, more than three times the 
federal minimum wage (see Table 8 ).4
These barriers to prosperity and disinvestment in federal housing programs have put decent, affordable 
housing out of reach for millions of people and disproportionately impacted Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous 
communities. Families with children are hit especially hard by the affordable housing crisis.
•   More than 1 in 3 children live in households burdened by housing costs, meaning more than 30 percent 
of their family income goes toward housing.5 Sixty-one percent of children in low-income households are 
rent-burdened.6
•   Nearly 2.6 million families with children experience “worst-case housing needs,” meaning they are 
extremely rent-burdened, their income is at or below the poverty line, they spend half of their income on 
housing, and receive no housing assistance from the government.7
•   Twenty percent of Black households, 17 percent of American Indian or Alaska Native households, 15 
percent of Hispanic households, and 10 percent of Asian households (compared to just six percent of 
white households), are extremely low-income renters and are often locked out of affordable housing due 
to systemic and structural racism and decades of racist policies.8
The affordable housing crisis is the primary reason so many families are unhoused. Children made up 
107,069—nearly 1 in 5—of the nearly 568,000 people who were unhoused on a single night in January 2019.9
•   Thirty percent of people who were unhoused were in families with children, and half of all families who 
are unhoused with children lived in just three states: California, Massachusetts, and New York. Family 
homelessness declined by 5 percent between 2018 and 2019 and by 27 percent between 2007 and 2019.10
•   In 2019, more than half of individuals in families who were unhoused were Black.11 Black youth are  
83 percent more likely than youth of other races to be unhoused.12
•   More than 1.3 million children under six were unhoused in 2017.13

The State of America’s Children® 2021HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS
More than 1.5 million unhoused children were enrolled in public schools during the 2017-2018 school year, 
according to the Department of Education, excluding younger children and youth not enrolled in school  
(see Table 9 ).14
•   The number of unhoused students has increased by 15 percent since the 2015-2016 school year.15
•   Seventy-four percent of unhoused students during the 2017-2018 school year were living temporarily  
with family or friends; 12 percent were in shelters or transitional housing; 7 percent were in hotels or 
motels; and 7 percent were unsheltered, often living in abandoned buildings or cars.16
•   Access to school for unhoused children is complicated by economic mobility and the lack of school 
supplies and clothes, funds for transportation, and necessary records to enroll in a new school.  
The trauma, poor physical and mental health, hunger, and fatigue many experience continue to 
challenge these children when they get to school.
•   In addition to school-aged public school students, 4.2 million teens and young adults experienced 
homelessness during 2016 and 2017.17 Black and Hispanic youth, youth living in poverty, and young 
adults; youth with less than a high school diploma or GED; young parents; youth aging out of foster care; 
and LGBTQ youth were all at especially high risk of homelessness.
Housing insecurity and homelessness are exacerbated by a lack of accessible federal assistance. This assistance 
is extremely effective, but these programs do not come close to meeting families’ needs because they are 
woefully underfunded.
•   Families with children make up 60 percent of those helped by federal rental assistance.
•   Although federal rental assistance can help reduce homelessness, housing instability, and overcrowding, 
only 1 in 4 eligible households receive it.18
•   Housing vouchers can help families move from areas of concentrated poverty to lower-poverty 
neighborhoods. Children who moved from concentrated poverty neighborhoods before age 13 have 
been shown to have higher earnings as 26-year-old adults when compared with those who did not leave 
the neighborhoods.19
•   Vouchers for unhoused families with children reduce foster care placements by more than half and also 
reduce school moves and other hardships.20
The pandemic has accelerated the nationwide affordable housing crisis and the racial inequities in 
housing. By February 2021, the hardship facing renter families with children was staggering. More than 
a quarter of renter families with children were behind on their rent.21 In February, nearly 4 in 10 of those 
families reported little or no confidence in their ability to pay the next month’s rent.22 Most shocking 
of all, almost half of renter families with children said it was either somewhat or very likely that they 
would lose their home within the next two months due to eviction.23
Though evictions were banned in many states and localities for much of 2020 and banned nationwide 
beginning in September by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many evictions slipped 
through the patchwork of legal protections and became a major driver of the spread of COVID-19. Evictions 
that took place between the beginning of the pandemic and the CDC’s national eviction moratorium 
in September led to 433,700 excess COVID-19 cases and 10,700 additional deaths.24
If the CDC's eviction moratorium is allowed to expire before renters receive adequate assistance from 
Congress, 30 to 40 million renters are at risk of losing their home due to eviction.25 The fallout from 
such a wave of evictions would be devastating, a crisis primed by the nation's failure to address its 
underlying affordable housing crisis.COVID-19 Has Pushed Millions of Children and Families to the Brink of EvictionChildren need healthy food to grow, learn, and thrive. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, however, 
children in America went hungry at alarming rates. Institutional racism, low wages, and other inequities 
made it impossible for many families—especially Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous families—to put food on the 
table. At the same time, policymakers have refused to adequately fund nutrition programs to reach and feed 
all children in need. Millions of children entered this crisis without consistent access to nutritious food, leaving 
them especially vulnerable to hunger and harm.
In 2019, more than 1 in 7 children—10.7 million—were food insecure, meaning they lived in households where 
not everyone had enough to eat (see Table 10 ). These households struggled to afford and access healthy 
meals, forcing them to rely on low-cost food to feed their children, skip meals, or even go hungry.
•   Black and Hispanic children were twice as likely to live in food-insecure households as white children. 
Nearly 1 in 4 Black children (24.1 percent) and 1 in 5 Hispanic children (19.2 percent) lived in households 
that didn’t get enough food to eat in 2019, compared with 1 in 9 white children (11.0 percent).1
•   Younger children also faced a greater risk of hunger. Households with children under 6 were more likely 
to lack access to healthy food than households with children under 18.2
•   The majority of households experiencing hunger struggle to put food on the table even with full- or  
part-time employment. In 2019, 61 percent of households experiencing hunger were in the labor force;  
51 percent had at least one full-time worker.3 With living expenses rising, wages stagnating, and systemic 
racism, food and other basic necessities are becoming increasingly out of reach for working families. 
•   Lack of nutritious and healthy food is linked to low birth weight and birth defects, physical and mental 
health problems, oral health problems, and poor educational outcomes.4
School meal programs like the National School Lunch Program (NLSP) and the National School Breakfast Program 
(SBP) are a critical source of nutritious food for children experiencing hunger and poverty. Many children typically 
consume up to two full meals a day at school and too often, these are the only meals they can count on. 
•   Nearly half of all public school students rely on free or reduced-price school meals to meet their daily 
nutritional needs.5 During the 2018-2019 school year, more than 21.6 million children received free or 
reduced-price school lunch, and 12.4 million received free or reduced-price breakfast (see Table 11 ).
•   While most schools are now serving free meals to all children regardless of income in response to 
COVID-19, a growing number offered universal meals through the Community Eligibility Provision 
(CEP) prior to the pandemic. During the 2019-2020 school year, nearly 30,700 schools serving 14.9 
million children participated in community eligibility,6 allowing them to offer free meals to every 
student without processing applications or collecting meal fees. This is up from nearly 28,800 schools 
that participated during the previous school year. Serving meals to all students at no charge reduces 
administrative burdens and costs, enabling schools to invest time and resources in building stronger 
nutrition programs that reach more children. 
Even during traditional school years, however, most children who receive free or reduced-price school meals 
cannot access them when schools are closed after school, on weekends, and over the summer. Prolonged 
school closures due to COVID-19 are now exacerbating the systemic gaps in federal nutrition support, leaving 
children without reliable access to healthy meals year round.
CHILD HUNGER AND NUTRITION

The State of America’s Children® 2021CHILD HUNGER AND NUTRITION
•   Only 1 in 15 eligible children received after school suppers through the At-Risk Afterschool Meals 
component of the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) on an average weekday in October 2019.7
•   In summer 2019, the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the Seamless Summer Option (SSO) 
through the NSLP reached only 1 in 7 children (13 percent) who received free or reduced-price lunch 
during the 2018-2019 school year (see Table 11 ). This marks the fourth year in a row that participation in 
summer nutrition programs declined.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—our nation’s largest federal nutrition program—  
helps connect children to healthy meals to supplement food budgets, improve health, and reduce poverty.  
Due to limited funding, however, SNAP benefits fall far short of meeting the need—and that need has only 
grown since the pandemic began.
•   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helped feed 17 million children in Fiscal Year 
2018—nearly a quarter of all children in America (see Table 12 ). SNAP participation is linked to improved 
health and educational outcomes .8
•   SNAP lifted nearly one million children out of poverty in 2019 and helps more children escape deep 
poverty than any other government program.9
•   In FY2018, 3.8 million households had no income except SNAP benefits, including 1.2 million households 
with children.10
•   Half of all families that received SNAP in 2019 were not able to get enough healthy food,11 however, 
because SNAP benefits were too low. Among households with children, monthly SNAP benefits 
averaged just $118 a person—or less than $4 a day.12
Federal nutrition programs like SNAP must be strengthened and expanded to support children’s well-being 
and success. 
•    Calculating SNAP benefits using the Low Cost Food Plan rather than the current Thrifty Food Plan would 
increase SNAP benefits by 31 percent, improve SNAP’s anti-hunger impact, and lift 1.5 million children out 
of poverty.13
•     Boosting SNAP is smart economic policy, especially during recessions. Every $1 invested in SNAP 
generates $1.50 to $1.80 in economic activity and creates jobs.14
Child hunger was a crisis long before the COVID-19 pandemic—and it has only worsened since. 
Widespread school and child care closures have left millions of children without reliable access to 
affordable meals, while record job losses have made it even harder for families to keep food on the 
table at home. Now, child hunger is reaching dangerous new heights. As of February 2021, more 
than 1 in 7 adults with children (14.5 percent) reported that their children were not getting enough 
to eat15—more than five times the pre-pandemic rate (3 percent).16 
Due to historic and systemic racism, children of color are going hungry at even higher rates.  
As of February 2021, more than 1 in 5 Black and Hispanic adults with children (22.8 percent and 20.6 
percent, respectively) said their households were not getting enough to eat compared with 1 in 10 
white adults with children (10.4 percent).17 If unemployment and poverty rates remain elevated, as 
many as 1 in 4 children—18 million in total—could be at risk of going hungry as a result of COVID-19.18 
Without continued and expanded nutrition assistance during the pandemic and beyond, rising child 
hunger will devastate our children’s development and community success for years to come.COVID-19 is Deepening America’s Longstanding Hunger Crisis CHILDREN LOST HEALTH INSURANCE BETWEEN 2016 AND 2019.726,000  
All children need access to comprehensive, affordable health coverage that is easy to get and to keep. 
Yet, even before our country began facing a devastating pandemic that has left more than 28 million 
Americans infected with the coronavirus, including more than 3 million children, our children were losing 
access to the health coverage they need to survive and thrive at an alarming rate.1
Decades of hard-fought progress to expand access to comprehensive, affordable health and mental health 
coverage through expansions of Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable 
Care Act brought the rate of uninsured children in America to an historic low. However, over the course of the 
last three years, our nation has shamefully reversed course and the number of uninsured children in America 
continues to steadily  increase .2 
•   In 2019, an estimated 5.7 percent of children under age 19 (nearly 4.4 million) were uninsured—an increase 
of 320,000 more children without health insurance since 2018 (see Table 13 ). This is the third year in a row 
the number of uninsured children has grown and it is the largest annual increase in more than a decade.3 
•   This data also highlights continued and worsening disparities in health insurance coverage. The rates 
of uninsured children were especially high among Hispanic children, undocumented children, children 
living in the South, and children in families with lower incomes; and these children were among those 
that experienced some of the greatest increases in uninsured rates between 2018 and 2019.4
•   This means millions of children and families lacked health insurance even before the rapid spread of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the beginning of the economic crisis where many parents became unemployed 
and lost access to job-based health insurance. While fortunately, some of these children may be eligible 
for Medicaid and CHIP, it is but certain that many of them are going uninsured.5 In 2018, more than half 
(57.4 percent) of uninsured children were eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, demonstrating the critical need for 
outreach and enrollment efforts.6 
Unfortunately, this is far from surprising given sustained efforts over the last four years by the Trump 
administration to undermine the public health insurance system, including Medicaid and CHIP, which form 
the backbone of the health insurance system for children in low- to middle-income families, as well as the 
administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies which have led many families to remove their eligible 
children—many of them U.S. citizens—from the health coverage they need out of fear of repercussions.7
•   In 2019, Medicaid and CHIP provided comprehensive, pediatric-appropriate and affordable health 
coverage to more than 36 million children under 19 (see Table 14 ).
•   More than half of American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, multi-racial, and Hispanic children rely on 
Medicaid and CHIP as their source of health coverage.8
•   Following steady increases in child enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP since 2007, 2017 was the first 
year to not see an increase despite a strong economy—and those numbers have only gotten worse in 
subsequent years. Child enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP decreased by 821,000 between 2017 and 2018 
and decreased by 224,000 between 2018 and 2019.9
•   Children in low-income families are far more likely to be covered by Medicaid and CHIP than private 
insurance. In 2019, 72 percent of children in low-income families had public health insurance coverage, 
including Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, and TRI-CARE.10
•   These health insurance programs provide lifelong benefits that far outweigh the short-term costs.  
The National Bureau of Economic Research compared children eligible for Medicaid during childhood 
with those not eligible and found Medicaid-eligible children were more likely to attend college and make 
greater contributions as adult taxpayers.11

CHILD HEALTHINCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY23
 
The State of America’s Children® 2021We know that children with health coverage are more likely to receive the preventive services they need, 
including immunizations; miss fewer days of school and have better educational outcomes; and grow up to be 
more economically secure and more likely to contribute to their communities.12 As children are losing coverage 
at staggering rates, there will be long-term consequences for their health and well-being.  
When parents have health coverage, their children are more likely to have health coverage. 
•   A child is eight times more likely to have public health insurance if their parent has it.13
•   States that have expanded Medicaid coverage to parents have higher Medicaid participation among children. 
For example, Massachusetts’ coverage expansion for parents cut the rate of uninsured children in half.14
•   While 33 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid to very low-income parents and 
adults under the ACA’s expansion option, 12 states have not done so as of October 2020 (see Table 15 ).
•   States that have not expanded Medicaid to parents and other adults under the Affordable Care Act have 
seen increases in their rate of uninsured children nearly three times as large as states that have.15
•   Lack of health coverage—as well as inequities in our healthcare system and disparities in social 
determinants of health—have devastating impacts on our nation’s infants and mothers.16 The maternal 
mortality rate is higher now than it was decades ago, and Black women are bearing the brunt of this 
crisis.17 What’s more, for every 1,000 infants born in 2018, six died before their first birthday (see Table 16 ). 
Continuing to expand coverage to low-income parents through the ACA’s Medicaid expansion would 
help decrease the number of uninsured children as well as ensure more women access to essential 
prenatal care to help reduce both maternal and infant mortality.18CHILD HEALTH
Although COVID-19 infection and death rates may be lower for children when compared to adults,  
our children are certainly not immune—to the virus itself or the racial inequities it is magnifying. 
•   As of February 25, 2021, 3,168,274 total child COVID-19 cases have been reported, representing  
13.1 percent of all cases. Children were 0 to 0.19 percent of all COVID-19 deaths in the states that 
provided data (Note: only 43 states provided data on the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths).19
•   CDC reports show that between February and July 2020, 78 percent of children who died from 
COVID-19 were Hispanic, Black, and American Indian children, though they represent only  
41 percent of the population.20
These disparities mirror the disparities we see among adults and reflect decades of structural racism 
and injustice that have created a long history of social and economic inequities.21 Long before COVID-
19, children of color were more likely to experience harmful environmental factors and toxic stress, 
grow up with underlying health conditions, and experience inequitable health care into adulthood 
including racial bias, discrimination, and inadequate treatment.22 Amid the pandemic, children of color 
are more likely to live with essential workers; experience crowded housing conditions, food insecurity, 
and wealth gaps; and face additional barriers to accessing high-quality, non-discriminatory health 
care—inequities that put the health and well-being of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian children  
at risk during a public health crisis.23
In addition to COVID-19 cases, the pandemic has created further child health concerns as well. 
Children are missing routine well-child visits that include important developmental screenings and 
vaccinations: compared to March through May 2019, there have been 3.2 million fewer child screening 
services, 6.9 million fewer outpatient mental health services, and 1.7 million fewer vaccinations for 
children ages zero to two through Medicaid and CHIP.24 Even with the need to continue to social 
distance and limit potential exposure, ensuring children have access to preventative services is 
critical in order to prevent further health concerns. Vaccines save lives and are critical in order to keep 
children safe from preventable diseases and ensure against the added crisis of a preventable outbreak 
amid the ongoing pandemic.Children Are Not Immune24IN 2019, CENTER-BASED CHILD CARE FOR AN INFANT  
COST MORE THAN PUBLIC COLLEGE TUITION IN
28 STATES  AND DC.
The first five years of a child’s life are a time of both great opportunity and risk as their brain develops 
more rapidly than at any other point. Children who grow up in supportive environments are more likely 
to develop self-confidence, an increased desire to learn, and better impulse control as well as improved 
achievement in school and throughout their life.1 Unfortunately, COVID-19 has upended a system that was 
already not adequately serving children and families: even before the pandemic, children—especially the  
3.6 million children under six living in poverty—lacked access to a meaningful continuum of care and supports 
during this critical period of development.2
A full continuum of high-quality early childhood development and learning opportunities from birth to age five 
have been proven to buffer the negative impacts of poverty and other stressors, improve outcomes throughout 
a child’s life, and yield great societal returns on investment. 
•   Head Start and Early Head Start are federally-funded, high-quality early childhood programs that provide 
comprehensive services including child care, mental health, nutritional, and other developmental 
services and connect poor children and families with other community resources when needed. Children 
who participate in the Head Start program are able to pay better attention in school and engage in 
learning; perform better in cognitive and language development; and have better pre-reading, pre-
writing, and vocabulary skills making them more prepared for kindergarten and school.3 The Maternal, 
Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program similarly promotes child development and 
school readiness.4 Gaps in opportunity and outcomes based on race and income exist from the start 
of school, but access to high-quality early childhood programs can give children the skills they need to 
thrive in school and close these gaps.5 
•   Studies show children who attend high-quality early childhood programs are more likely to graduate 
from high school and hold a job, make more money, and are less likely to have contact with the criminal 
justice system than peers who do not. Programs that directly target children’s health outcomes, like 
Head Start, have been shown to increase child health insurance, child immunization, and receipt of 
primary care.6
•   Research estimates the lifelong return on investment for quality early childhood programs is more than 
13 percent a year for every dollar invested.7
High-quality, affordable child care that meets children’s developmental needs is a critical part of the early childhood 
continuum and essential for working families, but the cost of high-quality child care is a barrier for many.
•   Center-based child care for an infant cost more than public college tuition in 28 states and the District 
of Columbia in 2019 (see Table 17 ). In one study, more than 80 percent of two-child families were paying 
more for child care than for rent.8
•   The Child Care and Development Fund, which provides subsidies to help families with child care costs, 
served just 15 percent of all federally-eligible children in 2016.9
•   The number of children receiving publicly-funded child care subsidies has decreased by more than 
430,000 since 2006 (see  Table 18 ). Access to high-quality child care is not guaranteed even for families 
who do receive subsidies as care costs increase.10
•   A well-trained, competitively-compensated workforce is necessary to ensure the child care provided is 
high-quality and our children are supported during their most critical years of development. However, in 
2019, child care workers in 42 states were paid less than half of a living wage for a single parent with one 
child (see Table 19 ). 
While many existing early childhood development and education programs are effective, they often fall far 
short of serving and supporting all children in need.
EARLY CHILDHOOD
  Children’s Defense Fund25
 
The State of America’s Children® 2021EARLY CHILDHOOD
•   Voluntary, evidence-based home visiting programs provide impressive short- and long-term gains for 
children and families who participate. However, in FY2019, the MIECHV Program served only a small 
portion of parents and children across the country.11
•   Due to underfunding, Head Start served less than 57 percent of eligible three and four-year-olds and 
Early Head Start served less than 8 percent of eligible infants and toddlers in 2019.12
•   Other quality preschool programs for three and four-year-olds are also a key part of the continuum. Yet, 
according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), during the 2018-2019 school 
year, only 34 percent of four-year-olds and 6 percent of three-year-olds were enrolled in a state-funded 
preschool program. Only four states operated a program that met all ten of NIEER’s evidence-based 
quality standards (see Table 20 ). 
•   While total state funding for preschool increased by 3.6 percent during the 2018-2019 school year, the 
increase was small compared to high growth years and spending per child was essentially flat after 
adjusting for inflation.13
•   Full-day kindergarten boosts students’ academic achievement as well as their social and emotional skills. 
Studies show full-day kindergarten can produce long-term educational gains, especially for children 
of color and children from families with low incomes.14 The majority of five-year-olds (82.7 percent) 
in kindergarten are enrolled in a full-day program; however, access to full-day kindergarten is only 
guaranteed in 17 states and the District of Columbia.15
The high cost of child care and lack of early childhood investments leave many children without quality 
care during critical years of brain development. We must ensure every child has the head start they need 
through access to a continuum of high-quality, comprehensive early childhood opportunities starting at birth. 
To do this, Congress must ensure child care providers have the immediate support needed to keep from 
permanently closing during the pandemic and states have the long-term funding needed to reconstruct a 
child care infrastructure that better serves all children and families. 
In May 2020, Cristina Guajardo of Austin, TX, was let go from her job and unable to start a new job until 
her two-year-old’s subsidized daycare was able to reopen. Cristina turned down job opportunities as 
bills continued to pile up and was forced into the impossible decision between caring for her child and 
beginning a much-needed new job.16
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that child care providers are not only essential for the 
development and education of our next generation, but for parents like Cristina who have been 
forced to choose between working to keep food on the table and provide for their families and staying 
home to care for their children as many child care providers don’t have the resources they need to 
safely stay open. Child care is also essential for our healthcare workers, United States Postal Service 
(USPS) workers, and other workers providing essential services we all depend on to keep our economy 
running. This burden has fallen especially hard on our nation’s mothers as 2.2 million women have left 
the workforce since the pandemic began, largely due to caregiving responsibilities;17 mothers could 
face $64.5 billion in lost wages and economic activity with continued inaction.18 
With months-long child care closures and little federal relief to date, as many as 4.5 million child care 
slots could be permanently lost due to the pandemic—a loss that is estimated to impact at least 2.25 
million families.19 Many child care providers—including those that have contributed their own funds 
and faced growing debt to ensure they have the resources they need to stay safe while caring for our 
children—continue to face economic destabilization and permanent closures.20 Our child care system 
was struggling long before the pandemic and we must ensure the system is strengthened and has the 
necessary funding and support that recognizes it as the as the necessity it is for families, businesses, 
and our economy. The Child Care Crisis Creates Impossible Decisions for Families  Children’s Defense Fund26EDUCATION
STUDENTS ATTEND SCHOOLS WITH POLICE BUT NO 
COUNSELOR, NURSE, PSYCHOLOGIST, OR SOCIAL WORKER.14 MILLION  
All children deserve to attend diverse, well-funded schools where they feel safe and protected, where they 
have access to high-quality educators and resources, and where their education is culturally responsive, 
developmentally appropriate, and intellectually stimulating. They have a right to the robust enforcement of 
our nation’s civil rights and education laws and their education must be free from discrimination. 
Unfortunately, this is not the reality for too many students. While COVID-19 has crippled our country’s public 
education system even further, America’s schools were deeply segregated and inequitable long before the 
pandemic. Poor children and children of color are likely to already be behind their wealthier and white peers 
when they start school, and as they progress through schools with smaller budgets and fewer educational 
resources, it is too often impossible to catch up. 
•   Less than half of children born into household and neighborhood poverty are ready for school at age  
five compared with 78 percent of their wealthier peers.1
•   More than 75 percent of lower-income fourth and eighth grade public school students were not proficient  
in reading or math in 2019, compared with less than 50 percent of higher-income fourth grade and less than 
55 percent of higher-income eighth grade students (see  Table 21 ).
•   More than 77 percent of Hispanic and more than 79 percent of Black fourth and eighth grade public 
school students were not proficient in reading or math in 2019 compared with less than 60 percent of 
white students (see Tables 22-23 ).
•   During the 2017-2018 school year, 19 percent of Black, 21 percent of Hispanic, and more than 26 percent 
of American Indian/Alaska Native public school students did not graduate on time compared with  
only 11 percent of white students (see  Table 24 ).
Students of color in schools that are highly segregated along racial and economic lines have significantly 
less access to highly-qualified and experienced teachers and high-quality educational resources. Academic 
indicators such as standardized test scores and graduation rates indicate that learning suffers accordingly.
•   Only 1 in 8 white students attends a school where the majority of students are Black, Hispanic, Asian,  
or American Indian, whereas nearly 7 in 10 Black children attend such schools.2
•   Every school district in the U.S. where segregation is high or even moderate has a large achievement gap.3
•   In 2017, 60 percent of Black children attended high-poverty schools with a high share of students of  
color while fewer than 9 percent of white children did.4
Large disparities in school funding mean that children living in lower-wealth areas—often children of color 
and children growing up in poverty—also attend under-funded schools that have fewer high-quality teachers, 
fewer curricular resources, larger class sizes, and less student support.
•   As of 2015, only 12 states distributed more funding to high-poverty school districts than low-poverty 
districts. In many states, the wealthiest districts spend as much as two-to-three times what poorer 
districts spend per pupil.5
•   Many states cut funding for education due to the Great Recession in 2008, and as of 2017, K-12 funding  
in 22 states and the District of Columbia remained below pre-recession levels.6
•   Studies suggest that a 25 percent increase in per-pupil spending during all 12 years of a child’s education 
could eliminate the average secondary education achievement gap between lower-income and higher-
income children.7
INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY27
 
The State of America’s Children® 2021EDUCATION
Too many students, especially students of color, face exclusionary discipline policies that threaten to derail 
their education or over-policed schools that put their very safety at risk.8 Over the last decade, schools have 
increased investment in school policing under the guise of making them safer for students. However, police 
in schools do not necessarily make children safer, but rather contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline 
and continue to disproportionately deny Black children, Latino children, and children with disabilities the 
opportunity to succeed.9
•   During the 2015-2016 school year, the suspension rate for Black students in public school was more than 
four times that for white students (see Table 26 ).
•   Fourteen million students attend schools with police but no counselor, nurse, psychologist, or social 
worker. This is despite evidence that schools with these types of supports “see improved attendance 
rates, better academic achievement, and higher graduation rates, as well as lower rates of suspension, 
expulsion, and other disciplinary incidents.”10
•   While students with disabilities made up only 12 percent of students during the 2015-2016 school year, 
they comprised 26 percent of students who received out-of-school suspensions.11
Children who are experiencing homelessness, in foster care, or returning from juvenile detention are especially 
likely to be educationally disadvantaged and are less likely to graduate from high school.
•   The estimated national graduation rate for students experiencing homelessness is only 67.5 percent, as 
compared to the overall national average for all students which is 85.3 percent.12
•   Because of the lack of adequate supports, students in foster care are more likely to be suspended or expelled, 
to score lower on standardized tests in reading and math, to be involved in special education, and to have 
higher rates of grade retention and drop out, and are less likely to attend and graduate from college.13
•   Without adequate educational resources, young people in juvenile justice facilities are chronically behind 
in school and make no meaningful progress in academic achievement while incarcerated. Approximately 
2 in 3 drop out of school after exiting the juvenile justice system.14
When we deny our children the education to which they have every right, we deny them the chance they 
deserve to have a bright future. We must continue to work to equitably distribute educational resources, 
eliminate segregation and gross inequities in school funding, and eliminate discriminatory education policies 
that undermine equal opportunities for all students.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an education crisis that will impact this generation of students for 
the rest of their lives. While many school districts provided some distance learning opportunities during 
the 2019-2020 school year, children with disabilities, children from low-income and unemployed families, 
children living in rural communities, and children of color faced many barriers to accessing this modified 
education—including insufficient internet access, lack of support for online learning due to parent work 
schedules, and inability to effectively learn via modified formats, among others. 
Too many students could not access modified education or lived in districts where no instruction was 
offered after schools closed for the last several months of the 2019-2020 school year.15 A survey of close to 
1,600 families found that parents with low incomes were “10 times more likely to say their kids are doing 
little or no remote learning,” and children with Individualized Educational Program accommodations 
(which includes many students with disabilities) are “twice as likely as their peers to be doing little or no 
remote learning.”16 This untenable situation has carried into the 2020-2021 school year in districts across 
the country.COVID-19 Leaves Marginalized Students Disconnected and Behind  Children’s Defense Fund28CHILD WELFARE
A CHILD IS REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME 
AND PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE
  EVERY TWO MINUTES .
 
The child welfare system is in the midst of a paradigm shift that recognizes the critical 
importance of supporting families so children can remain safely at home and foster 
care is used only as a last resort. With the historic passage of the Family First Prevention 
Services Act (Family First) in 2018, states and tribes can now utilize guaranteed child welfare funds to provide 
certain evidence-based services and programs to stabilize families and prevent the need for foster care.1 
However, Family First, which is still in early stages of implementation, is just the first step to ensure children 
can thrive with their families. 
The U.S. has deeply underinvested in the upstream services that support families and keep them strong, 
services that extend well beyond the bounds of the formal child welfare system and into housing, economic 
support, and other critical services, and this was exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. By investing 
in keeping families strong, we can prevent child maltreatment and give all children the opportunity to thrive. 
In 2019, 651,505 children were victims of abuse or neglect, a decrease of 21,643 compared to the previous year 
(see Table 27 ). That means, on average, a child is abused or neglected every 48 seconds in America, 1,785 each 
day.2 More than half of all child maltreatment cases in 2019 involved children who were six years old or younger, 
with 14.9 percent of cases involving infants under one.3 Of these children, 251,359 entered foster care.4 
•   Neglect, often a proxy for the consequences of poverty, was the most common reason for children 
entering the child welfare system. Neglect was associated with a child’s removal in 63 percent of cases. 
Issues related to unsafe or substandard housing were associated with 10 percent of child removals.5
•   After steadily rising every year since 2008, the proportion of child removals in which parental drug abuse 
played a role declined in 2019. Parental drug abuse is partly responsible for 34 percent of child removals, 
while alcohol abuse played a role in 5 percent of child removals.6
•   A common misconception is that physical and sexual abuse are the primary drivers of child welfare 
involvement, though these serious forms of abuse factor into a smaller portion of cases. Physical abuse 
was associated with 13 percent of removals and sexual abuse four percent.7
Children in foster care are among the most vulnerable children in America. There were 423,997 children in 
care in 2019 (see Table 28 ), 41 percent of whom were under the age of six.8 These children spend an average 
of 19.6 months in foster care, with 14 percent spending more than three years in the system.9 Children of color, 
particularly Black and American Indian/Alaska Native children, are dramatically overrepresented in the child 
welfare system. Of every 1,000 white children in the United States, 5.2 are in foster care, compared with 9.9 of 
every 1,000 Black children and 16.9 of every 1,000 American Indian/Alaska Native children.10
•   Nationally, Black children, are represented in foster care at a rate that is 1.66 times their portion of the 
overall population, and in 18 states at a rate that is more than double (see  Table 29 ).
•   American Indian/Alaska Native children are represented in foster care at a rate that is 2.84 times their 
portion of the population nationally. This disproportionality varies by state, with 11 states where the 
percent of the foster care population that is American Indian/Alaska Native is more than double the 
percent of the overall child population that is American Indian/Alaska Native, including one state where it 
is more than 15 times as high (see Table 29 ). 
Children do best when placed with families, preferably their own relatives, but some require a level of mental 
or behavioral health treatment that can only be provided in a congregate (non-family) setting, such as a group 
home or child care institution. Congregate care is meant to be temporary treatment, but children are often 
inappropriately placed in these settings without a clinical need or are held long after their clinical needs are met. 29
 
The State of America’s Children® 2021CHILD WELFARE CHILD WELFARE
•   Nationally, 11 percent of children in foster care are placed in congregate care settings, with up to 27 percent 
of children in congregate care in certain states (see Table 30 ). While this number has been steadily 
decreasing, the number of children in congregate care increased in 19 states between 2017 and 2018.11
•   More than 2.6 million children live in households headed by grandparents or other relatives without 
their parents present.12 Approximately 133,000 children in foster care are placed with relatives, and 
the remainder of these kinship placements occur outside of the child welfare system with little or no 
government support.13
Foster care is intended to be temporary, with the ultimate goal of returning children safely home to their 
families. When this is not possible, children must be placed into permanent homes, either through adoption, 
guardianship, or other arrangements with relatives. In 2019, 248,669 children left foster care after an average of  
20 months in care.14 
•   In 2019, only 47 percent of children exiting foster care were reunified with their families, the lowest 
percentage ever recorded (see Table 31 ).
•   In 2019, 64,415 (26 percent) children were adopted out of the child welfare system, the highest number 
recorded,15 and 122,216 children were waiting to be adopted.16
•   After steadily declining since 2008, the number of children aging out of foster care jumped by more 
than 14 percent in 2019, with 20,445 youth reaching adulthood without a permanent family.17 When 
the system fails to find permanent homes for youth, they are significantly more likely to experience 
homelessness, unemployment, and incarceration. 
More resources are needed to ensure that every child can grow up in a safe, stable, and loving family.  
By dramatically increasing investments in family support, we can keep families strong and prevent the need 
for foster care. Making this early investment will free up necessary resources to improve the child welfare 
system for the families that do need it, including specialized treatment services to help children heal from the 
trauma they have experienced and robust supports to help families reunify safely. 
Stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that are detailed throughout this report —economic, 
housing, and food insecurity, school and child care closures, and decreased access to services and 
supports—are testing the resilience of families. Stress directly impacts the ability of parents to safely 
care for their children and an overload of stressors without sufficient support contributes to child 
maltreatment.18 As the pandemic places unprecedented stress on families, it also made it more 
difficult for them to access the services that help them to remain strong. In response, the child welfare 
system has had to rapidly adapt to help children remain safe with their families.
The pandemic weighed especially heavily on older youth in extended foster care and on youth who 
have recently aged out as they often lack the resources and connections that other young people have 
relied on to weather this crisis and face staggering levels of job loss and food insecurity.19 Additionally, 
kin caregivers, especially the approximately 2.5 million kin caregivers raising children outside the formal 
child welfare system, have been made particularly vulnerable as they are disproportionately older and 
at high risk from the virus.20
The pandemic has laid bare the fact that too many families were in a precarious position before the 
pandemic began. It has made clear that we must invest in the strong families and communities that 
keep children safe.COVID-19 Places Unprecedented Stresses on Children,   
Families, and the Child Welfare System  YOUTH JUSTICE
CHILDREN ARE ARRESTED EACH DAY IN THE U.S. 1,909 
The number of children arrested and incarcerated has declined over the past decade, largely due to positive 
changes in policy and practice. However, America’s children continue to be criminalized at alarming rates 
and disparities have persisted. Many children—particularly children in poverty; children of color; children with disabilities; children with mental health and substance abuse challenges; children subjected to neglect, abuse, 
and/or other violence; children in foster care; and LGBTQ children—are pushed out of their schools and homes 
into the juvenile justice or adult criminal justice systems. 
•   In 2019, 696,620 children were arrested in the U.S. (see Table 32). A child or teen was arrested every  
45 seconds despite a 62 percent reduction in child arrests between 2009 and 2019.1 
•   During the 2015-2016 school year alone, there were over 61,000 school arrests and 230,000 referrals to law enforcement, largely overrepresented by students with disabilities, Black students, and Indigenous 
students. The prioritization of police over mental health professionals in schools often leads to the 
criminalization of typical adolescent behavior and fuels the school-to-prison pipeline. Today, 14 million 
students attend schools with police but no counselor, nurse, psychologist, or social worker.
2
•   Although the number of children in the juvenile justice system has been cut in half since 2007, 43,580 
children and youth were held in residential placement on a given night in 2017. Nearly 2 in 3 were placed 
in the most restrictive facilities.3 
•   Another 653 children were incarcerated in adult prisons on any given night in 2019—down from 2,743  
in 2009 (see Table 33). 
•   Despite research showing that young people’s brains continue to develop and mature through 
their late teens and into their mid-twenties,4 young adults do not often have access to the age- and 
developmentally- appropriate policies and resources they need. Adolescents and young adults often 
“age out” of offending; however, as of 2021, 46 states and the District of Columbia automatically 
prosecute 18-year-olds as adults and 3 states automatically prosecute 17-year-olds as adults (Vermont is 
the first and only state to expand juvenile court jurisdiction to 18). All states also allow or require younger 
children charged with certain offenses to be prosecuted in adult court.5 
Even as child arrests and detentions have fallen, extreme racial disparities have persisted across the 
juvenile and adult criminal justice systems. Children of color, particularly Black children, continue to be 
overcriminalized and overrepresented at every point—from school discipline and arrest to sentencing and 
post-adjudication placements. 
•   Although 63 percent of children arrested in the U.S. were white, American Indian children were 1.5 times 
more likely to be arrested and Black children were 2.4 times more likely to be arrested than white children.6 
•   In 2017, the residential placement rate for children of color was two times higher than that of white children nationwide: Hispanic children were 1.4 times more likely, American Indian children were 2.8 
times more likely, and Black children were 4.6 times more likely to be committed or detained than white 
children. In 18 states and the District of Columbia, the residential placement rate for children of color was 
four times higher than that of white children.
7
•   Two-thirds (67 percent) of children in the juvenile justice system were children of color: 41 percent were 
Black and 21 percent were Hispanic (see Table 34). 
•   Children of color are also disproportionately transferred to the adult criminal justice system, where they are tried and prosecuted as adults. In 2018, Black youth represented less than 15 percent of the total 
youth population but 52 percent of youth prosecuted in adult criminal court.
8 Black youth are nine times 
more likely than white youth to receive an adult prison sentence, American Indian/Alaska Native youth are almost two times more likely, and Hispanic youth are 40 percent more likely.

The State of America’s Children® 2021YOUTH JUSTICE
Boys, youth with disabilities, and LGBTQ youth also come into disproportionate contact with the juvenile and 
adult criminal justice systems. 
•   In 2017, the residential placement rate for boys was more than five times that for girls. Eighty-five percent 
of children in residential placement were male.10 
•   At least 1 in 3 youth in the juvenile justice system has a disability qualifying them for special education 
services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)—nearly four times the rate of youth 
in public schools. However, less than half receive special education services while in custody.11
•   The percent of LGBTQ children in the juvenile justice system (20 percent) is more than two times that of 
LGBTQ youth in the general population (7-9 percent); 85 percent are LGBTQ children of color.12
Children do not belong in prisons. Incarceration does not support the growth and development of our children; 
it places them at risk and limits their access to resources.
•   While incarcerated, children are often provided with inadequate education instruction, health care, 
and counseling services and they are at greater risk of maltreatment, physical and psychological abuse, 
sexual assault, and suicide.13 
•   The use of solitary confinement further deprives them of social interaction, mental stimulation, and key 
services during a critical time of adolescent brain development. Youth of color and LGBTQ youth are at 
heightened risk of being placed in solitary confinement and youth with disabilities are often placed in 
isolation due to lack of available services or accommodations—when no child should be placed in solitary 
confinement regardless of identity.14
•   Risks are heightened for children in the adult criminal justice system, which is even more focused on 
punishment rather than rehabilitation and treatment. Children in adult jails are more likely to suffer 
permanent trauma and are five times more likely to die by suicide than children held in juvenile 
detention centers.15
As youth crime and arrest rates continue to decline, now is the time to re-imagine youth justice. We have better 
choices than incarceration: diversion, treatment, after school programs, and family support programs support 
children, keep communities safe, and save taxpayer dollars. It is time to end the criminalization of children and 
provide every child time and space for learning, mistakes, and restorative support from caring adults. 
With continued reliance on criminalization and incarceration, our nation’s children—especially Black 
children—are being put at risk of lasting harm to their health, development, and well-being instead of 
receiving the resources and supports they need. This is especially true amid the ongoing pandemic.
Latoyia Porter of Louisiana is filing early release papers for her son, Treyjon. “We can do more for him 
on this side of the facility. He’s already served five years for vehicular theft, a non-violent crime,” she 
said. “With no rehabilitation services, what’s the point of having him in there?” Treyjon and other young 
people detained in Louisiana have had their rehabilitation services suspended; have been pepper 
sprayed by untrained temps; and have been denied COVID-19 tests despite having symptoms.  
“It’s really hard for a mother not to be in control of her child’s healthcare,” Latoyia explains.16
Living in congregate care settings with inadequate resources puts children like Treyjon at great risk 
of COVID-19. As of late February 2021, more than 3,750 young people in juvenile facilities and even 
more staff have been diagnosed with coronavirus across 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico.17 The roughly 44,000 incarcerated children across the country are living in fear of COVID-19 and 
are facing solitary confinement as a form of social distancing, limited access to PPE, limited or no 
visitations or contact with loved ones, and limited educational and recreational activities. To date, their 
needs have largely been ignored by federal lawmakers as they have crafted legislation to respond to 
the crisis. COVID-19 Magnifies the Harms of IncarcerationGUN VIOLENCE
IN 2019, A CHILD OR TEEN WAS KILLED  
WITH A GUN EVERY  
2 HOURS AND  
36 MINUTES .
Even before COVID-19, another epidemic was killing our children at higher rates: gun violence.  
Gun violence was the leading cause of death for all children and teens ages 1-19 in 2018, surpassing 
motor vehicle accidents for the first time in history.1 Children and teens are far more likely to die from 
gunfire than COVID-19,2 yet our leaders continue to allow gun violence to go uncurbed and gun laws to 
go unchanged. 
After years of congressional inaction, a growing number of children are paying with their lives. In 2019, 
3,371 American children and teens were killed with guns—enough to fill more than 168 classrooms of  
20 (see Table 3 5). 
•    Child and teen gun deaths hit a 19-year high in 2017 and have remained elevated since.3 
•    In 2019, nine children and teens were killed with guns each day in America—one every 2 hours  
and 36 minutes.4
•    Guns killed more children and teens than cancer, pneumonia, influenza, asthma, HIV/AIDs, and 
opioids combined.5 
•    While mass shootings grabbed fleeting public and policymaker attention, routine gunfire took 
the lives of more children and teens every week than the Parkland, Sandy Hook, and Columbine 
massacres combined.
•    Since 1963, nearly 193,000 children and teens have been killed with guns on American soil—
more than four times the number of U.S. soldiers killed in action in the Vietnam, Persian Gulf, 
Afghanistan, and Iraq wars combined.6
Shamefully, gun deaths reflect only part of the devastating toll of America’s growing gun violence 
epidemic. Many more children and teens are injured than killed with guns each day in our nation.
•    For every child or teen fatally shot, another 5 suffered non-fatal gunshot wounds.7
•    An estimated 16,644 children and teens were injured with guns in 2018—one every 32 minutes.8
Gun violence affects all children, but children of color, boys, and older youth are at greatest risk. 
•    Black children and teens had the highest gun death rate in 2019 (11.9 per 100,000) followed by 
American Indian/Alaska Native children and teens (6.4 per 100,000).9
•    Although Black children and teens made up only 14 percent of all children and teens in 2019, they 
accounted for 43 percent of child and teen gun deaths.10
•    Black children and teens were four times more likely to be killed with guns than their white peers.11
•    Eighty-six percent of children and teens who died from gunfire in 2019 were boys. Boys were six 
times more likely than girls to die in gun homicides. Black boys were 18 times more likely to be 
killed in gun homicides than white boys.12 
•    Eighty-five percent of child and teen gun deaths occurred among 15- to 19-year-olds, but infants 
and toddlers were far from immune. Guns killed more preschoolers than law enforcement officers 
in the line of duty. In 2019, 86 children under 5 were killed with guns compared with 51 law 
enforcement officers in the line of duty.13 
No child is safe in a nation with easy access to deadly weapons. Even before the pandemic drove up fear 
and gun sales, there were too many firearms in our homes and streets—and a shocking number were 
sold without background checks.
•    As of 2017, American civilians owned 393 million firearms—more than one gun per person.  
In contrast, U.S. military and law enforcement agencies possessed 5.5 million.14
  Children’s Defense Fund32INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY33
 
The State of America’s Children® 2021GUN VIOLENCE
•    Americans accounted for less than five percent of the global population, but owned nearly half  
(46 percent) of all civilian guns in the world.15
•    Nearly 1 in 5 guns are sold without a background check due to a loophole in federal law exempting 
sales at gun shows, online, or between private individuals.16
Children are learning there are no safe spaces in our gun-saturated nation. Many children even live 
in homes with loaded, unlocked guns and know where they are kept. Too often, this leads to tragic 
accidents and preventable deaths. With a growing number of children learning and playing at home 
during COVID-related closures, the risk of gun accidents and suicides has only increased. 
•    A third of households with children have a gun and nearly half of gun-owning households with 
children do not store all of their firearms safely.17
•    An estimated 4.6 million children live in homes with at least one unlocked and loaded gun—and 
most children know where these guns are kept.18 About 3 in 4 children ages 5-14 with gun-owning 
parents know where firearms are stored and more than 1 in 5 have handled a gun in the home 
without their parents’ knowledge.19 
•    Guns in the home are more likely to endanger than protect loved ones. The presence of a gun in 
the home makes the likelihood of homicide three times higher, suicide three to five times higher, 
and accidental death four times higher.20
•    Eight children and teens are killed or injured in accidental shootings involving an improperly stored 
gun each day in America.21 
It is long past time for leaders to end America’s gun violence epidemic. Congress must urgently pass 
common-sense gun safety measures like universal background checks and child access prevention laws 
to protect children from firearms in their homes, schools, and communities. All children deserve the 
chance to live, learn, and play safely—free from violence and fear.  
The pandemic has created and exacerbated so many crises for children and families and gun 
violence is no exception. Unprecedented increases in gun sales—coupled with financial insecurity, 
social isolation, and other stressors—are magnifying America’s gun violence crisis. 
•    Nearly two million guns were sold in March 2020 alone—the second highest number of 
guns ever sold in a single month—and this disturbing trend continued in the months  
that followed.22
•    Even with much of the country on lockdown, mass shootings hit a record high in 2020. 
Children witnessed, suffered, or died in 611 mass shootings in 2020—up from 417 in 2019.23
•    Gun accidents in the home have also surged during the pandemic. School and child care 
closures have exacerbated children’s risk of dying in gun accidents at home. Between March 
and May 2020, accidental gun deaths by children increased by 30 percent relative to rates 
over the past three years.24
•    The pandemic has also intensified factors that contribute to gun-related domestic violence 
and community violence: job losses and financial insecurities have left victims of domestic 
violence more vulnerable to harm as well as fueling community gun violence.25
The COVID-19 crisis has exposed the consequences of our nation’s longstanding failure to pass 
policies to keep children safe where they live and learn. Our leaders must not only advance 
meaningful solutions to address the COVID-19 crisis but also the ongoing gun violence crisis in 
America. We cannot allow children to die at the hands of these crises.COVID-19 is Magnifying Our Gun Violence Epidemic and  
Highlighting the Need for Immediate ReformIMMIGRANT CHILDREN

CHILDREN IN THE U.S.— APPROXIMATELY 18 
MILLION—ARE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS.
34   Children’s Defense FundImmigrants are a part of our families, workplaces, and houses of worship. They are friends and neighbors 
woven into the fabric of our communities. Critically, they are parents tucking children into bed each night.1 
More than 1 in 4 (26 percent), or approximately 18 million, U.S. children lived with at least one immigrant parent 
in 2018.2 For America to flourish and prosper, we must commit to policies that promote all children’s well-being 
and center children of immigrants in these policies.
In direct opposition to children’s well-being, the Trump administration's four-year legacy of dangerous, reckless 
policy choices has created a climate of confusion, fear, and impossible choices. The administration continuously 
attacked family unity, a foundational principle of child welfare protected by the U.S. Constitution.3
•   Family separation is dangerous to children’s health, development, and well-being.4 Yet during the 
enforcement of the administration’s Zero Tolerance policy between April and June 2018, the government 
took 4,500 children from their parents.5 Although a court order forced the administration to end the policy 
in June 2018, 1,100 more children were taken from their parents between June 2018 and November 2019.6 
As of October 2020, the parents of 545 children taken from their families cannot be found.7 
•   Family separation is still happening. Today, there are fresh threats of separations due to the Remain in 
Mexico program, which has trapped nearly 60,000 people in terrible conditions at the U.S. border as they 
are forced to wait for their immigration proceedings in Mexico.8 Parents are faced with the impossible 
choice between an indefinite wait in dangerous tent camps and sending their children alone across the 
border.9
•   Parents detained together with their children in the U.S. have also faced family separation. In May 2020, 
families told their lawyers that ICE officers asked them to make the unconscionable choice of either 
separating from their children or staying in indefinite detention during a global pandemic.10 
Family separation as well as the battle over the border wall and who will pay for it have been highly visible 
horrors, but the Trump administration’s less visible shifts in regulatory and executive action also erected barriers 
to critical, life-saving benefits and services, affecting the lives of millions in the U.S.11 What does that “invisible 
wall” look like?
A hungry child. 
•   Fear and confusion—known as the chilling effect—over intentionally complex Trump administration 
“public charge” regulations are causing families to disenroll or forgo health care, nutrition, public service, 
and other economic support programs.12 For example, between 2016-2019, Texas experienced a precipitous 
drop in enrollment in benefit programs,13 including a 13.5 percent drop in SNAP enrollment between 
December 2017 and April 2019.14 A qualitative study of 32 geographically diverse organizations in Texas by 
CDF-Texas found that anti-immigrant policies such as public charge caused many mixed-status families  
to fear enrolling even their citizen children.15
•   A nationally representative survey found that 11.4 percent of adults in immigrant families with children 
reported they or a family member avoided a nutrition program (SNAP or WIC) in 2019.1635
 
The State of America’s Children® 2021IMMIGRANT CHILDREN 
A child without access to health care. 
•   More than 1 in 4 immigrant children did not have health coverage in 2019 (25.5 percent compared to  
5.1 percent of native-born citizen children).17 
•   As of January 2020, 35 states and the District of Columbia provided health coverage to lawfully residing 
immigrant children without a five-year wait,18 and as of July 2019, six states and the District of Columbia 
use state-only funds to provide Medicaid coverage to income-eligible children regardless of immigration 
status.19
A scared child. 
•   Children’s feelings of personal safety are linked to the perceived safety of those who care for them.20 
Chronic uncertainty and distress about the threat of enforcement activity destroy children’s sense of 
safety and their mental health.21 The Trump administration’s aggressive enforcement choices, including 
continuous threats to DACA, heightened fears of deportation. 
•   More than 250,000 children in the U.S. have at least one parent who is a DACA recipient.22 
•   An estimated 6.9 million children lived with undocumented parents.23
Beyond tearing down the harmful policies that separate families and chill access to critical services, we must 
lean forward and build a permanent solution to this nation’s immigration crisis so that every child has the 
opportunity to grow up in a safe, stable, and loving family and community. 
 
Right now, immigrant workers are at the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis, keeping all of us healthy, fed, 
and cared for in health care, retail, manufacturing, and other essential industries.24 In recognition of 
the critical role immigrant families play in our communities, Congress must ensure that COVID relief 
packages are inclusive of our immigrant children and families.25 
For example, our leaders have the opportunity to make economic stimulus payments inclusive and 
fair. Immigrants and their families must be included in any new COVID stimulus payments and receive 
retroactive stimulus from when they were cut out of relief last year—regardless of the kind of taxpayer 
identification they use. 
COVID relief, including economic stimulus payments, help families make ends meet during this 
crisis, and it is well established that cash assistance also supports children’s well-being and healthy 
development.26 Our leaders must act swiftly to ensure the next COVID relief package is the most robust 
and inclusive yet. Immigrant Families are Essential Members of Our Communities  
and Must Be Prioritized in COVID-19 ReliefINCOME AND WEALTH

Notes: A family of four was considered poor in 2019 with an annual income below $26,370 and extremely poor with an income below half that amount 
($13,185). Poverty estimates differ based on the source of the Census data. Census data on poverty is collected through both the American Community 
Survey (ACS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS provides the most accurate national data on poverty and is therefore the official source 
of national poverty estimates. The ACS uses a larger sample size and is therefore preferred for state-level poverty data. All racial categories exclude 
children of Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic children can be of any race.

The federal government uses different guidelines for determining who  
is considered poor and who is eligible for public benefits. In 2019, a family  
of four was considered poor if their annual income fell below $26,172  
and extremely poor if their income fell below half that amount.  
A family of four was considered eligible for public benefits if  
their annual income fell below $25,750.

a   The federal poverty thresholds are used to calculate those who are considered poor and extremely poor. The poverty threshold numbers in the table 
are weighted averages of the actual thresholds. The actual poverty thresholds vary slightly based on the number of children and, for households of size 
one and two, whether the houshold includes someone over 64. Except for Alaska and Hawaii, which have slightly higher thresholds, no adjustments are 
made for differences in living costs from state to state. Extreme poverty is defined as half of the poverty thresholds. 
b  The federal poverty guidelines (also called the Federal Poverty Level) are a simplification of the poverty thresholds used to determine eligibility for public 
benefits and are adjusted annually to account for inflation.

Notes: Poverty estimates differ based on the source of Census data. Census data on poverty is collected through both the American Community Survey 
(ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS provides the most accurate national data on poverty and is therefore the official source of national 
poverty estimates. The ACS uses a larger sample size and is preferred for state-level poverty data. For national estimates, all racial categories exclude 
children of Hispanic ethnicity. For state estimates, only the "White" racial category excludes children of Hispanic ethnicity. Hispanic children can be of 
any race. The racial categories Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander are combined because disaggregated data were not available for most 
states. "N/A" means data were not available.

a The National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) defines a state preschool program as one serving 3- and 4- year olds that is funded, controlled, and 
directed by the state. Its primary focus must be early childhood education and it must offer a group learning experience to children at least two days each a week.  
It may serve children with disabilities but cannot be primarily designed to serve these children. State-funded preschool may be coordinated and integrated with the 
child care subsidy system in the state. State supplements for Head Start constitute state preschool if they substantially increase the number of children served and 
involve some state administrative responsibility. NIEER uses 10 benchmarks to measure the quality of state preschool programs: 1) comprehensive early learning and 
development standards that are horizontally and vertically aligned, supported, and culturally sensitive; 2) supports for curriculum implementation; 3) teachers with 
bachelor's degrees and 4) specialization in early childhood; 5) assistant teachers with child development associate's or equivalent degrees; 6) at least 15 hours/year of 
professional development, individualized plans and professional development plans, and coaching for lead and assistant teachers; 7) a maximum class size of 20; 8) 
child-staff ratios of no more than 10:1; 9) comprehensive vision, hearing, and health screenings; and 10) continuous quality improvement system. 
Note: “n/a” means no program.

Notes: “n/a” means the category is not reported by state. Percents add up to over 100 percent as some cases involved multiple types of maltreatment. Due to
