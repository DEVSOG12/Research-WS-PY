In Episode 5, we dig into an important part of the system — Commutation and the Board of Pardons. Hear from Naomi Blount-Wilson, a woman who spent 37 years in Pennsylvania’s prison system on a sentence to life without parole. Now she’s free and a voice of hope for many. We also hear from Lily Rorick, a leader in the campaign to change the commutation process, about what ordinary people have been doing to Move It Forward.Listen to Move It Forward Episode 5 on Spotify, Stitcher, Apple Podcasts or Google Podcasts or through the player below!RelatedNew Podcast Ep: What Happened to Our Communities when Gun Control FailedOctober 25, 2022Gun sales in Philadelphia have basically doubled over the course of the pandemic.
