In the article, the victim’s identity was modified, and the victim was either a sex worker, prostitute, social worker, or no title (simply woman).After reading the article, participants filled out a survey to measure their empathy for the victim and blaming of the victim and perpetrator, called a Victim Empathy Scale. They also filled out a survey to gauge whether the article had emotionally affected them, called a Positive and Negative Affective Schedule, or PANAS.The study found that respondents were slightly less likely to empathize with, and slightly more likely to victim-blame when the individual had a sex worker identity.Learn more by checking out the community research summary, or full article linked above!By Swop USA|2017-05-10T03:04:39+00:00March 28th, 2017|Blogs, Print Outs, Research Summary|Comments Off on Research Summary: The Role of Sex Work Stigma in Victim Blaming and Empathy of Sexual Assault SurvivorsShare This Story, Choose Your Platform!FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInWhatsAppTumblrPinterestVkEmailAbout the Author: 						Swop USARelated PostsStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)Staff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)Staff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)Moral Panic Monthly: Super Bowl Anti Sex-Trafficking Campaign Harms Minnesota Sex WorkersGalleryMoral Panic Monthly: Super Bowl Anti Sex-Trafficking Campaign Harms Minnesota Sex WorkersResearch Summaries: CanadaResearch Summaries: CanadaSearch for:Subscribe to our mailing list-->CategoriesAnnouncementsBillsBlogsCall to actionDays of ObservanceEducationalEventsFact SheetsFund RaisingHear Our VoiceInformationLegislationNewsPrint OutsResearchResearch SummaryUncategorizedArchivesAugust 2020June 2020March 2020January 2020November 2019October 2019August 2019June 2019May 2019March 2019February 2019September 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014Find us on FacebookPopularRecentCommentsMale Sex Workers Condemn Raid on RentBoy.comAugust 28th, 2015Trans Day of Remembrance Statement & Fact SheetNovember 12th, 2015PEPFAR Consultation – Urgent Feedback from Sex Worker Stakeholders Needed!November 15th, 2015SWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsAugust 24th, 2020Call To Action!
