As this report outlines, more work remains. EJI currently is seeking to end the adult prosecution of any child under age 14; to end the placement of any juvenile under age 18 in an adult jail or prison; and to abolish life imprisonment without parole and other excessive sentences imposed on children.Read the report (PDF)How to citeEqual Justice Initiative, “All Children Are Children: Challenging Abusive Punishment of Juveniles” (2017).Explore more reportsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
