Last week, just two days after Mr. Mullins was killed, prison officials did an intensive large-scale contraband search at St. Clair — a search that advocates have been seeking for over a year. ADOC publicized their contraband search but did not report the stabbing death of Mr. Mullins until nearly a week later.In the days and weeks before his murder, ADOC received numerous reports that Steven Mullins was at risk, had been threatened with violence, and could not live safely without protective housing. Rather than place him in a protective unit, he was placed in a dorm known for violence and serious assaults, commonly referred to as the “hot bay.” On Monday, February 25, Mr. Mullins reported to ADOC officials that he had been threatened with stabbing and sexual assault and that he needed immediate assistance from prison officials. No action was taken. He was stabbed to death the next day.EJI filed a lawsuit against St. Clair Correctional Facility in 2014 after ADOC failed to address dangerous conditions and an extraordinarily high rate of violence, including six homicides in the preceding 36 months. ADOC signed a settlement agreement in federal court in November 2017 that mandated the implementation of reforms to improve the safety of officers and inmates. In June 2018, EJI notified the federal court that ADOC has not complied with the agreement and has failed to implement those reforms.St. Clair has experienced three escapes since December 2017. Two of the men escaped using firearms. In the past year, five men were stabbed to death and dozens of other incarcerated people have been seriously assaulted, raped, and beaten. EJI has asserted that these problems are largely the result of insufficient management, training, staffing, and classification, and of oversight issues that will not be solved with a new prison, which has been ADOC’s primary focus.EJI has called on the ADOC Commissioner and Alabama’s governor to declare that emergency action is needed to prevent further violence in the state’s prisons.Tags:Prison ConditionsRelated ResourcesAlabama's Prisons Are Deadliest in the NationEqual Justice InitiativeAlabama's Prison Crisis Claims Another Life: Second Homicide in Three WeeksEqual Justice InitiativeAlabama Reaches New Record High Number of Prison HomicidesEqual Justice InitiativeAlabama's Failure to Respond to Prison Crisis Claims Another LifeEqual Justice InitiativeRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
