These private phone companies have long charged exorbitant rates to families of incarcerated people for talking to their loved ones in prison, and they have fought hard against FCC regulations that would limit rates and eliminate extra fees for prison phone calls.Rates are set by contracts between these companies and state and local governments, who often receive “commissions” or kickbacks for each jail or prison. Securus’s lawsuit claims that the Florida DOC’s invitation to negotiate for the new phone contract “explicitly prohibited” the vendor to remit a portion of the revenue from the contract back to the agency as a “commission.”Without having to pay commissions, the suit says, “vendors can provide lower inmate telephone call rates to inmates’ families and friends. Keeping call rates lower promotes inmates’ contact with family and friends, increasing eventual re-unification and re-entry and reducing recidivism.”But instead of negotiating for lower rates, the department instead asked vendors to compete over providing “value-added” goods and services that were “wholly unrelated” to the procurement process.The lawsuit argues that the Department violated the Florida Constitution because it exercised budgeting and appropriation powers that are exclusively granted to the legislature when it used the procurement process to obtain goods and services that were not allocated by the legislature.Tags:PovertyPrison ConditionsRe-EntryRelated ResourcesPrison Phone Provider Accuses Florida Dept. of Corrections of Using Inmates' Families as a Slush FundThe Florida Times-UnionRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
