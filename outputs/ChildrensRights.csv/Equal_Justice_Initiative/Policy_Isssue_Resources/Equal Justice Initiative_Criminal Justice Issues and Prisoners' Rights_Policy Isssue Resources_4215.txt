One in five women said they had recently experienced psychological distress in prison, compared to one in seven men.Similarly, 68 percent of women in jail reported a history of mental illness, compared to 41 percent of men.The study does not address the reasons for this gender disparity. Ron Honberg, senior policy adviser at the National Alliance for Mental Illness, told the Marshall Project that one possible factor is “that incarcerated women have experienced sexual trauma before their imprisonment at a much higher rate than men. They are also likely more inclined to report psychological distress to the prison mental health services than male inmates.”Justice Department researchers also found that more than half of white men and women in prison reported a diagnosis of a mental disorder, which was nearly double the rate for Hispanics and more than 1.6 times higher than for Black people. Dr. Robert Cohen, a member of the New York City Board of Correction, cited a recent study on jail mental health services at Rikers Island that found that “older white men were directed towards mental health services, while younger Black and Hispanic men were directed to solitary confinement, and self harm.” He told the Marshall Project, “I don’t think that fact reflects different rates of mental illness, I think it demonstrates racial bias.”A new study found that incarcerated women report mental health problems at a much higher rate than incarcerated men.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesIndicators of Mental Health Problems Reported by Prisoners and Jail Inmates, 2011-12documentU.S. Department of JusticeThe Mental Health Crisis Facing Women in PrisonMarshall ProjectRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
