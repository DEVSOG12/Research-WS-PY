Roger Willmore, chairman of the resolutions committee.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesEJI Report on Alabama PrisonsdocumentWSFA EditorialObviousAL.com EditorialLatest Report on Alabama Prison Abuses Implies System Cruel to its CoreAL.comAlabama Baptists Call for Prison Reform, Noting Overcrowding and Sex AbuseRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
