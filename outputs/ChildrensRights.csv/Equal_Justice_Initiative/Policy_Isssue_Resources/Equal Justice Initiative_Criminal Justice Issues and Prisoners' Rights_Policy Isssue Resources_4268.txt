In interviews with more than 50 women incarcerated at Tutwiler, EJI had uncovered evidence of frequent and severe officer-on-inmate sexual violence. The Department of Justice has now launched a formal investigation into conditions at Tutwiler.In response to EJI’s complaint, officials from the Alabama Department of Corrections publicly announced intentions to invite independent auditors to assess the facility’s operations. However, as EJI attorney Charlotte Morrison informed the commission, DOC has made no changes in leadership at the prison.Holding leadership accountable is one of four practices EJI suggested the commission should adopt. “In the face of documented and repeated criminal misconduct and institutional misreporting,” Ms. Morrison testified, “the legislature should demand substantive changes in the leadership at Tutwiler prison. The continuing and documented incidence of sexual abuse and corroborating statements from facility staff illustrates that the current leadership’s response thus far has been wholly inadequate.”EJI also recommended that prison and Department of Corrections officials be required to report incidents of sexual misconduct involving staff to the commission and proposed the immediate creation of specific, mandatory standards for investigating allegations of abuse. The commission should end Tutwiler’s practice of putting women into punitive segregation when they reported being victims or witnesses of sexual abuse.While an independent audit is a positive first step, EJI suggested that independent reporters with authority to make unannounced visits to the prison, tour all areas and review all documents, and conduct confidential interviews with both incarcerated women and facility staff should be employed to oversee adherence to new anti-abuse procedures.The Commission on Girls and Women in the Criminal Justice System was created by the Alabama Legislature to develop and implement a comprehensive, research-based, best practices model regarding women in prison that ensures their safety and welfare.Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Kim Thomas said he will work to employ the recommendations from EJI, in addition to others from the federal government across Alabama’s entire prison system.Tags:Prison ConditionsRelated ResourcesChanges Proposed for Embattled Tutwiler Women's PrisonPDFWSFA NewsRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
