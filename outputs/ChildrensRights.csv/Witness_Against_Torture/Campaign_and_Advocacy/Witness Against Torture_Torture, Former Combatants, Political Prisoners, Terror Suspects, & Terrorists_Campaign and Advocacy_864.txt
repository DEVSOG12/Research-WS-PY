Below you'll find details, but also stay tuned as our Coalition partners announce their 20th year events.Also in this newsletter you'll find an opportunity to endorse the prisoners' open letter to Biden, an invitation to hear our own Maha Hilal discuss her upcoming book (this Thursday), an announcement about the release from prison of all the KBP7, and a couple of thoughtful articles about the war on terror.And once again it's time to ask for your help to keep WAT going, so we've included a link for making a donation.In peace and solidarity,WAT Organizing TeamActions:Endorse the Guantanamo prisoners' Open Letter to BidenMany of you followed the Open Letter to Biden, published in the New York Review of Books.  As campaigners against Guantanamo, we in WAT are each being asked by CAGE to endorse the Call to Close Guantanamo spearheaded by former political prisoners and also former guards, activists, lawyers, leaders and civil society organizations.Email your Senator(s) -- again!The Senate is -- finally -- bringing the NDAA up for debate and a vote.  The Senate version includes language prohibiting Biden from bringing Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. for trial or medical treatment. NRCAT makes it easy to write to your Members of Congress to tell them to pass the House version of the NDAA that doesn't restrict detainee transfers out of Guantanamo.WAT Book GroupWhat: We're discussing Mansoor Adayfi's new memoir, Don’t Forget Us Here: Lost and Found at Guantánamo.When: Tuesdays Nov 30, Dec 14 and 28, Jan 4 at 7 ETSign up: To join our calls, email witnesstorture@gmail.com with subject "Mansoor Book Group."Dr. Maha Hilal book talk: Thursday December 2 at NoonWe look forward to reading Dr. Maha Hilal‘s forthcoming book Innocent Until Proven Muslim when it comes out on January 26, 2022.  Meanwhile, register to join Maha  by Zoom on Dec 2 as she talks with Khury Petersen-Smith at IPS about Islamophobia and solidarity against the domestic and overseas aspects of the War on Terror.  Her book is a guide and an urgent response to Islamophobia after two decades of the War on Terror.Where WAT will be on January 11Yes! The 20th year of the War on Terror demands a reckoning.  On January 11, Witness Against Torture will stand with the Muslim men still in locked in Guantanamo, and we'll stand from coast to coast. Stalwarts from Maine to a remote island off the shores of Vancouver will witness in orange jump suits in their communities.  Message YOUR local action (with or without jump suits!) to the WAT Facebook page and we'll post it.Some of us will be in DC in front of the White House at noon, in orange jump suits and hoods.  Local folks and those of you from afar are welcome (already Iowa and Wisconsin are represented), but we're still in pandemic mode, so you're on your own for housing and we ask you to be vaccinated and wear a mask. We'll livestream it for everyone who can't be there.Fasting for JusticeWe won't be gathering in DC this year, but some of us will fast at home, starting on Friday January 7th and ending on Monday January 10th, with a Zoom gathering at each end.  (Hint: you don't have to be fasting to join us!).  To get the Zoom call link, send an email to witnesstorture@gmail.com with subject line "Fast Jan 2022."A conversation between Mansoor Adayfi and James YeeDate and time TBA, but likely Sunday or Monday Jan 9th or 10th.  We'll keep you posted.Background: Mansoor wrote a letter of solidarity from the prisoners to Chaplain Yee after he was vilified as a Muslim by the military.  The military never sent the letter to him, even after they honorably discharged him.  James didn't know until this year of the men's solidarity with him.Other War on Terror January EventsOur Coalition partners are organizing events for January, so stay tuned.  WAT is co-sponsoring the Tea Project's event, Reparations Now and Onwards: Voices of Survivors, Advocates, and Next Steps, on Sat, January 8, 2022 from noon to 2 pm ET.Donate to Witness Against Torture!Join Christopher Spicer, who says:I donate to Witness Against Torture because it is such an effective frontline impact organization. We refuse to accept the world-destroying tyranny of torture.  Former prisoner Shaker Aamer said, “We never hunger strike to die, we did it to show we are human beings.”  We have witnessed the humanity and agency of the men: using only their bodies, they discredit US policy, undermine Guantanamo’s legitimacy, establish political community, build bonds of solidarity and demand freedom from ill treatment.  I donate to Witness Against Torture because we live in the question of our conscience everyday, in solidarity with the self determination of the men in Guantanamo.News and Food for ThoughtKings Bay Plowshares 7 prison sentences have ended, but not their burdensRejoice! All prison sentences are complete. As of yesterday the KBP7 -- which includes several longstanding WAT members -- have finished their home confinement after prison terms, but the government isn't done with them.  We welcome all of you back into the community, and commend your ongoing resistance.20 years after Patriot Act, surveillance of Arabs and Muslims is relentlessNadine Naber in Truthout, Nov 14, 2021The U.S. is now more than 20 years beyond the Patriot Act of October 2001. The immediate aftermath of 9/11 brought a heavy U.S. state focus on Arabs and Muslims in the U.S., rationalizing an expansion of policing and surveillance activities against them. It also inspired the convergence of shared struggles for liberation out of a growing consensus that we cannot abolish policing without abolishing U.S. militarism and empire building. Read moreWhen the World Becomes Your BattlefieldMaha Hilal in Inkstick, Sep 29, 2021On Sept. 20, 2001, just nine days after the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush used the phrase “War on Terror” for the first time. Addressing a joint session of Congress — and the nation — Bush sketched a vision for what would become a sprawling global apparatus of state violence and warfare with myriad echoes in domestic policy. Two decades after the GWOT was launched, there appears to be no end in sight.  Read moreDonate to support our workPlease consider a donation to help fund our annual Fast for Justice this January.  We are completely volunteer-driven and run. We have no paid staff; all of the money you donate goes to funding the work we do together.  Click here to donate.Who we areWitness Against Torture was formed in 2005 when 25 Americans went to Guantánamo Bay and attempted to visit the detention facility. They began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, end indefinite detention and torture and call out Islamophobia. During our demonstrations, we lift up the words of the detainees themselves, bringing them to public spaces they are not permitted to access. Witness Against Torture will carry on in its activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.www.witnessagainsttorture.comCopyright © 2021 Witness Against Torture, All rights reserved.Want to change how you receive these emails?You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.
