Several of them met when they participated in the “Walk for Healing and Peace” from Washington, D.C. to New York City in late 2001 organized by Kathy Kelly of Voices in the Wilderness.20 Years Later, a virtual film festival, centers the theme of peace and justice. Each film is paired with a live panel featuring producers, directors, 9/11 family members, and/or subjects of the film, open to audience questions.The movies:We Are Many (when 30 million people protested against the war on Iraq);No Responders Left Behind (activists demanding relief for ill First Responders);In Our Son's Name (victims whose parents choose reconciliation);Finding Our Voices (Americans living their conscience by patriotic dissent);The Outsider (struggle by Director of National 9/11 Museum to keep his vision of the painful, personal story of 9/11 alive);The Mauritanian (Mohamedou Slahi's agonizing years at Guantanamo and his ultimate release).International Witness Campaign: September 11 to January 11Since 2001, when Bush announced the launch of a “crusade”, we have witnessed 20 years of illegal wars, carpet bombings, drone assassinations, arbitrary detention, torture and mass displacement in the Muslim world.  Western democracies have also enacted countless legislations and policies targeting Muslim communities and undermining the rule of law for all.The International Witness Campaign includes over 40 international partners (including WAT) who will each commemorate some aspect of the two decades of the war on Terror, its impact, its failures and its future, while promoting solidarity, justice and dialogue.  Over the span of the next four months, from September 11, 2021 to January 11, 2022, groups around the world will hold events that will be posted on the IWC website. The website is live, and events will be posted in the coming weeks so keep checking back.  Meanwhile, here are some Sep events for you:20 Years Later: The True Costs of Our Post-9/11 Wars  (Wed, Sep 1, 10:30 am ET) Dr. Neta Crawford, Dr. Maha Hilal, Senator Jack Reed, and Representatives Barbara Lee, David Cicilline, and Ro Khanna.Indefinite Detention: Examining Guantanamo 20 Years After 9/11 (Thu, Sep 9, 4 pm ET)20 Years After September 11: Lessons in Solidarity (Tue, Sep 14, 3 pm ET)Expect other events on dates like Sep 18 (AUMF was signed into law) and Oct 7 (US invaded Afghanistan)Publication of Innocent Until Proven Muslim, Islamophobia, the War on Terror, and the Muslim Experience Since 9/11By Dr. Maha HilalIn her new book being released in October, scholar, organizer and WAT leader Dr.Maha Hilal tells the powerful story of two decades of the War on Terror.  She explores how the official narrative has justified a sprawling apparatus of state violence rooted in Islamophobia and excused its worst abuses. Hilal provides an overview of the many iterations of the War on Terror in law and policy.  She examines how Muslim Americans have internalized oppression; how some influential Muslim Americans have perpetuated collective responsibility; how the lived experiences of Muslim Americans reflect what it means to live as part of a "suspect" community.  Along the way, this marginalized community gives voice to lessons that we can all learn from their experiences, and to what it would take to create a better future.Book launch October 26 (details coming soon)WAT Reading Group Nov/Dec We will meet weekly in November and December, with Maha joining us for one of those meetings.  The October eBlast will include how to sign up for the reading group(s).  You can pre-order the book now or buy it in October.  And if the idea of a WAT reading group is popular, we can choose another book to study after this one!Donate to support our workPlease consider a donation to help fund our annual Fast for Justice this January.  We are completely volunteer driven and run.

They began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantánamo, end indefinite detention and torture and call out Islamophobia. During our demonstrations, we lift up the words of the detainees themselves, bringing them to public spaces they are not permitted to access. Witness Against Torture will carry on in its activities until torture is decisively ended, its victims are fully acknowledged, Guantánamo and similar facilities are closed, and those who ordered and committed torture are held to account.www.witnessagainsttorture.comCopyright © 2021 Witness Against Torture, All rights reserved.Want to change how you receive these emails?You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list.
