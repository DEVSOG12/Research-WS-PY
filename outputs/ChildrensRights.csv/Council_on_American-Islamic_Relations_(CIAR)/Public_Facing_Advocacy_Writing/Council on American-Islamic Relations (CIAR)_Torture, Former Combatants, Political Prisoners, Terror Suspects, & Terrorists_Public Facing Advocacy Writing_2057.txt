The letter was also signed by Fikre’s attorney Thomas Nelson.[MEDIA ADVISORY: Yonas Fikre will take part in a news conference about his case on April 18 in Stockholm, Sweden, at 4 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. For more information, contact Thomas Nelson, 503-709-6397, E-Mail: nelson@thnelson.com or CAIR Staff Attorney Gadeir Abbas, 202-742-6410, 720-251-0425, E-Mail: gabbas@cair.com]Fikre reports that he was “beaten on the soles of his feet, kicked and punched, and held in stress positions while interrogators demanded he ‘cooperate’ and barked questions that were eerily similar to those posed to him not long before by FBI agents and other American officials who had requested a meeting with him.” According to Fikre’s lawyer: “When Yonas [first] asked whether the FBI was behind his detention, he was beaten for asking the question. Toward the end, the interrogator indicated that indeed the FBI had been involved.”Fikre said he had previously rejected an FBI demand that he act as an informant. He is currently seeking asylum in Sweden because he fears what U.S. officials may do to him if he returns.CAIR: American Muslim Alleges FBI Had a Hand in His Torture“This disturbing case fits a pattern of proxy detention in which American Muslims are detained in other nations or prevented from returning home in a manner that is clearly designed to circumvent their constitutional rights,” said CAIR Staff Attorney Gadeir Abbas and Thomas Nelson in their letter to the DOJ.The letter also seeks assurances from the FBI that Fikre’s constitutional right to counsel be respected and his safety guaranteed should he return to the United States. Abbas noted that earlier this year, CAIR called on the DOJ to investigate acts of “coercion and intimidation” allegedly used by the FBI’s Portland Field Office to pressure Muslim citizens into giving up their constitutional rights if they wished to return to the United States from overseas. Fikre is originally from Portland.CAIR Asks DOJ to Probe Oregon FBI’s ‘Coercion’ of Muslim Citizens Video: CAIR Says Portland FBI is Coercing Muslims to Give Up Rights Last year, CAIR filed a lawsuit against the DOJ and the FBI seeking a court order to allow a Virginia Muslim teenager who had been detained in Kuwait and placed on a U.S. government no-fly list to return to the United States.
