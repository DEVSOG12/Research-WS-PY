Yesterday, three judges–two appointed by President Trump, and one appointed by President Bush–overturned that ruling.SEE: Appeals court upholds constitutionality of terror watchlist (AP)Appeals court upholds constitutionality of FBI terror watch list (Washington Post)https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/appeals-court-upholds-constitutionality-of-fbi-terror-watch-list/ar-BB1f8sSwIn a statement, CAIR Senior Litigation Attorney Gadeir Abbas said:“When CAIR began our nationwide litigation campaign to end the government’s Orwellian and unconstitutional watchlist program more than a decade ago, we knew that there would be victories and defeats along the way.Our strategy reflects this reality, with cases pending in courts across the country — from Oregon to Maryland to Michigan to Texas.“Yesterday, a three-judge panel on the Fourth Circuit reversed a historic district court decision that declared the entirety of the watchlist unconstitutional. In doing so, the judges ignored the dire consequences experienced by American citizens placed on the watchlist and took a dim view of what the Constitution requires. We are disappointed in this decision, but we remain undeterred. The fight is not over.“CAIR will now ask the entire Fourth Circuit to review the case. We hope that the entire slate of 15 Fourth Circuit judges will correct the errors of the panel of three circuit judges who issued yesterday’s decision. National security can never justify anti-Muslim bigotry.“And whatever the outcome, CAIR’s legal strategy has never relied on any single case. Today, CAIR has cases pending in courts within the Ninth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, and even other kinds of watchlist challenges in the Fourth Circuit. Altogether, we currently represent almost 50 Muslims in other court cases. And so long as one of those cases succeeds, inshallah, our entire community will benefit.”SEE: NJ Man sues in Texashttps://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2018/02/11/paterson-man-landed-no-fly-listno-fly-terror-watch-list-upended-paterson-mans-life-now-hes-suing-fed/1079702001/Oregon Man’s No Fly List case can proceedhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-civilliberties/muslim-american-can-sue-over-no-fly-list-u-s-appeals-court-idUSKCN1M02RUMaryland Judge Allows Watchlist Case to AdvanceMaryland Judge Allows Challenge To Terrorist Watchlist To Move AheadMuslim man’s lawsuit over border torture can continuehttps://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/03/05/muslim-dearborn-man-anas-elhady-lawsuit-ambassador-bridge-detention/3065915002/BACKGROUNDER:In January, CAIR attorneys argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in support of the Muslim civil rights organization’s constitutional challenge to the federal government’s Terrorism Screening Database that anchors the watchlisting system.LISTEN TO CAIR’S ORAL ARGUMENTS:LISTEN: CAIR Offers Oral Arguments in Defense of Federal Court’s Decision Declaring the Terror Watchlist IllegalIn September 2019, a lower court judge held that the watchlisting system is broadly illegal and violates the rights of the 23 Muslims who CAIR represents in the case.JUDGE’S OPINION: https://tinyurl.com/WatchlistOpinionSEE: Secret Terrorism Watchlist Found Unconstitutional in Historic Decisionhttps://theintercept.com/2019/09/06/terrorism-watchlist-lawsuit-ruling/CAIR’s position is supported by a broad and ideologically diverse group of amici (friends of the court), including the CATO Institute, ACLU, the Brennan Center for Justice, the Firearm Policy Coalition, Korematsu Center, Rutherford Institute, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.SEE: Diverse Coalition Supports Ruling Declaring Watchlisting System IllegalDiverse Coalition Files Amicus Briefs in Support of CAIR’s Watchlist ChallengeCAIR’s mission is to enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.La misión de CAIR es proteger las libertades civiles, mejorar la comprensión del Islam, promover la justicia, y empoderar a los musulmanes en los Estados Unidos.ENDCONTACT: Senior Litigation Attorney Gadeir Abbas, 720-251-0425, gabbas@cair.com; National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper, 202-744-7726, ihooper@cair.comFacebookTwitterLatest Press ReleasesAlmost 100 Community Members Take Part in 5th Annual Pennsylvania Muslim Capitol Day in HarrisburgOctober 26, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-OK, Community Partners Host Candidate Open HouseOctober 26, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Condemns Racist Vandalism at Iowa CollegeOctober 26, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Resignation of North Carolina Sheriff Over Racist CommentsOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR, Jetpac Release First National Directory of Local, State and Federal Elected Muslim Officials and JudgesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesVideo: CAIR-MN Director Jaylani Hussein Responds to Fargo Muslim Cemetery VandalismOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesContact info453 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20003Tel: (202) 488-8787Fax: (202) 488-0833www.cair.comMore contact infoAbout UsVision, Mission, Core PrinciplesCAIR at a GlanceCAIR: Who We AreNational Board of DirectorsDepartment DirectorsAnnual Reports and FinancialsEndorsements, Awards, RecognitionsCAIR ChaptersDispelling Rumors About CAIRWorking with Law EnforcementNews & MediaMedia ContactsPress ReleasesOp-edsBookable SpeakersVideosMedia ResearchCAIR LogosPhotosGet involvedCareersInternVolunteerEventsBecome an AllyUse Your VoiceResourcesKnow Your RightsCivil Rights ReportsWays to GiveGuides and toolkitsGuides to Muslim Religious PracticesBook a CAIR WorkshopRequest a SpeakerRegister to VoteGovernment Affairs ReportsTake ActionReport an incidentAction AlertsScroll to TopPrivacy PolicyLegalVolunteerJoin our Email ListEventsContact UsFacebook-fTwitterInstagramYoutube© 2022 Council on American-Islamic Relations.Website designed by INTELLIPLANS
