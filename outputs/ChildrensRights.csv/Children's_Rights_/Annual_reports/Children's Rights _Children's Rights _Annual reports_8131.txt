Of Counsel:Stephen Dixon Elizabeth Pitman Gretter Eric Thompson 3Protecting Children and Transforming 
Young Lives 
Over the last 20 years, Children’s Rights has transformed the lives of over 1 million children in 
15 states. 
But the need for our work—and your support—is all the more urgent. Right now, over half a 
million children in the United States are living in the care of governments. These numbers are climbing as states struggle to keep up with a surge of children entering the foster care system, due in large part to the opioid epidemic. 
Far too many of these kids are being harmed by the very systems set up to protect them. 
They are removed from their homes only to be uprooted again and again, often with their life’s belongings stuffed into a trash bag. These children are powerless to defend themselves within systems that function out of public view. 
Children’s Rights exists to make life better for children. In just the past few months, our 
unique model of strategic advocacy and legal action has continued to transform lives: 
 •  Fighting Back Against Cruel Immigration Policies: Children’s Rights continues to 
oppose government policies that hurt kids. Our voice has been prominent in advocating 
against practices that inflict potentially life-long harm on immigrant children separated from their parents or held in detention under inhumane, illegal conditions. 
 •  Stopping the Overmedication of Kids: A groundbreaking settlement in Missouri will stop the dangerous practice of giving children powerful psychotropic drugs without proper oversight and monitoring, often as chemical straightjackets to control behavior. Our case sets a legal precedent that has the potential to address this practice in child welfare systems nationwide. 
 •  Disrupting Systems that Make Kids Homeless: In a huge victory for children in Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, Florida has agreed to address a lack of housing so extreme that kids move from place to place 40, 50, 70 or more times and are effectively rendered homeless while under the care of the state. 
 •  Proving Child Welfare Systems Can Work: Our Tennessee case officially closed earlier this year. The reforms it engendered have transformed the state’s foster care system into a model for the nation. Today, children in Tennessee are more likely to be reunified with their families, adopted more quickly, and not put in group homes. The case is the subject of a powerful documentary hosted by actor Sam Waterston that is airing now on public television stations across the U.S. 
 •  Securing Access to Loving Homes: We are spearheading a national interfaith coalition created to fight a growing wave of government policies that allow taxpayer-funded foster care agencies to turn away otherwise qualified prospective foster parents simply because they do not pass an agency’s religious or moral litmus test—denying children in foster care the chance for a loving, forever home. 
Thanks to you, we are transforming young lives at a truly outsized scale. And with your continued support, we are poised to protect more children. Thank you for believing in us and the children we serve. 
Sincerely,
Megan Shattuck
