Of Counsel:
Stephen DixonEric Thompson3Protecting Kids. Providing Hope.
That is what Children’s Rights has done for more than 20 years—and it is your generous 
support that allows us to shine a light on the young people who need it most. 
T ogether we have been able to change the life trajectory of kids who are adversely affected in 
this country’s failing foster care systems. And while our impact is clear, now more than ever—with our social safety net increasingly at risk—youth are falling through the cracks. That is why Children’s Rights is proud to announce our expanding mission: Through relentless strategic advocacy and legal action, we will hold governments accountable for keeping kids safe and healthy , not only in this nation’s foster care systems, but in our juvenile justice, education and healthcare systems as well.
This allows us to shine a light on Michael*, 14. In and out of Missouri foster care since he 
was small, he has been prescribed an extensive, complicated and risky array of psychotropic medications. He arrived at one home without his medical records—the foster mother was simply handed a brown paper bag with his drugs. This is unacceptable, and why we have filed a federal class action in the state to ensure the drugs are only used with proper oversight.
And Lydia, a nineteen-year-old transgender woman in a long-term secure juvenile justice 
facility . Staff discriminated against her, and her peers harassed and assaulted her. “While I was in the facilities, I wasn’t able to focus on my classes and what I needed to learn. I was always more focused on who was out to fight me and who was going to jump me today ,” she told CR in our 
groundbreaking report, Safe Havens, which we published with our partners at Lambda Legal and Center for the Study of Social Policy .
And then there is Gary , a 16-year-old boy in the Boys State T raining School in Eldora, Iowa. 
Placed on suicide watch at least 27 times, he is only receiving brief telephonic counseling “sessions.” He has been given at least six psychotropic medications in a little over a year, without appropriate controls or consent, and was restrained for 77 hours in a seven-month period—including 67 hours in a full body restraint. W e recently filed suit to change practices at Eldora, whose mission is to rehabilitate, not harm.
Our passion to do right by all children is what drives us. W e have made lasting change, 
protecting hundreds of thousands of vulnerable youth, and we are poised to help millions more. Our dedicated staff will fight to protect our nation’s most valuable resource, day in and day out. W e hope you will do the same. Our children are depending on us…and you.
Sincerely ,
Megan Shattuck
