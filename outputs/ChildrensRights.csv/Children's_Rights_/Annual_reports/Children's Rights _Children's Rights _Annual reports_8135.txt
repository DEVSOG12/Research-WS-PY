Children’s Rights is on a mission.
W e are determined to build upon our past success, and protect even more abused and 
neglected kids when child welfare systems fail to do so. Meaningful reform takes time — 
but with 640,000 children living in foster care every year, we are acting with urgency to 
ensure vital, life-altering changes occur.
Over the past year, Children’s Rights made sure children in Connecticut moved out  
of institutions and into family homes, kids in metropolitan Atlanta regularly visited with their caseworkers and young people in Michigan were adopted into loving families 
more quickly . 
W e continued to fight on behalf of children in Rhode Island, too many of whom live in 
group homes and shelters; in Massachusetts, where kids are being maltreated in state 
care at a high rate; and in Texas , where thousands of children languish in care as their 
hopes for permanent families dwindle. 
W e also sought justice for an 11-year-old South Carolina boy who was sexually assaulted 
by another boy in a poorly-supervised group home, then denied the mental health services 
he desperately needed to heal. Our fierce advocacy led to a settlement, and in the wake of 
our lawsuit the group home, which had a history of child-on-child abuse, closed its doors.
The case exposed a child welfare system operating with a shocking lack of safety and 
oversight. It revealed a dangerous policy — at one point the state did not even require 
staff to be awake in some group homes — and highlighted a severe shortage of foster family homes, a factor that pushes too many South Carolina children into unsafe group 
homes and institutions. 
Over nearly two decades, our team has shown time and again that we are experts in foster 
care reform. In years to come, we will continue to confront pressing child welfare issues 
and target areas where our law and policy skills, and our ability to push concerns to the forefront, can best leverage widespread change. 
Children’s Rights knows thousands of kids are depending on us to ensure they are safe 
and have the care they need. W e are resolved to remain the vigilant, smart, passionate 
advocates they deserve and the leading national voice for foster care reform. 22013 FINANCeS
