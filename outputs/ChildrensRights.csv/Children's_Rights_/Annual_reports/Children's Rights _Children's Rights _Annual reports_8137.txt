REPOR T We are often asked, 
“ How do you ﬁnd the energy to 
ﬁght for foster kids year after year? It’s such difﬁcult work.” 
Yes, our jobs can be intense. E ven grueling. So where do we 
ﬁnd the will to press on? 
In the children whose rights we defend. 
Jarod Stites, above, is also pictured on the cover with his brothers Jaquan, Jeremiah and 
Moses. 
Take Jarod Stites, one of nine children represented in our 
class action lawsuit to reform O klahoma’s child welfare 
system. For years the agency operated without standards or 
accountability — repeatedly garnering one of the worst rates of abuse in care in the nation.1Jarod was one of many who suffered.  He was shunted between at 
least 20 placements in eight years. He hardly knew his caseworkers. One foster mother 
beat him with switches. He changed schools constantly , falling behind in his education. And his brothers’ early lives were just as tragic. Jaquan, Moses, Jeremiah and Jarod often were separated from one another as they bounced between unsafe foster placements, institutions and the abusive home of their biological mother. 
Children’s Rights never gave up on the Stites brothers or any of the 8,000 other children 
in Oklahoma’s foster care system. Not the 5-month-old infant who suffered a skull fracture when he was dropped by a worker holding two babies in an overcrowded shelter. Not the 5-year-old boy , who after being cycled through nine placements in less than a year, tried to jump out of a moving car so he could “go to God.” 
W e pressed on with our work, because we know that the lives of children can be transformed. And in early 2012, after four years of intense advocacy , we won a court-ordered reform that ensures Oklahoma ofﬁcials will revamp their dangerous foster care system. Now thousands of kids in Oklahoma will ﬁnally be given the protection they need and deserve.
The Stites brothers are ﬂourishing. They were adopted into a loving, stable home, and their 
family is giving the boys the foundation they need to pursue their own dreams. According to their mother Deborah: Jarod has won awards in his ROTC program; Jaquan made the football team; Moses is earning A ’s and B’s in school; and Jeremiah plays trumpet in the band. 
In the almost 20 years we’ve spent using comprehensive legal campaigns and policy work to reform over a dozen foster care systems throughout the U.S., we’ve witnessed the foundations of children’s lives being rebuilt — and their resiliency shining through. Remarkable young people like Jarod, Jaquan, Moses, and Jeremiah propel us forward. They drive us to shine light on the darkest corners of American foster care, to expose harm inﬂicted on children, and compel the reforms that help protect them. 
W e know unsafe systems can be ﬁxed. W e’ve made it happen. While we’ve made 
tremendous headway , we must press on for the 650,000 children spending time in U.S. foster care every year. With your support we can reach even more kids — repair even  more foster care systems — and ensure even more children are given the foundations  they need to thrive.

2Failing child welfare systems can be transformed  
to protect the children whose lives depend on 
them — we’ve proved this through tough legal action that compels system-wide reform. 
With the help of dedicated child 
advocates and experts in the ﬁeld, Children’s Rights investigates dangerous systems and builds airtight legal cases that expose consistent harm inﬂicted on children. W e develop long-term solutions and secure court orders that mandate top-to-bottom change. W e ensure that these orders are fully implemented so children in foster care are safe, even if it takes years. Nothing less is acceptable.
It is this attention to detail, combined with the passion and commitment of our enormously talented staff, which has led to Children’s Rights’ impressive track record:  we have won 15 out of 17 cases, producing real, measurable improvements in the lives of abused and neglected children.
Most recently , our reforms have brought hope to Oklahoma, where we won an 
extraordinary settlement in our long-fought effort to improve foster care. For four years we advocated that the system be revamped for the babies who stayed too long in shelters; for the kids moved too many times between foster care placements; and for the workers spread thin by overwhelming caseloads. Our landmark settlement agreement yielded a roadmap for independent child welfare experts to ensure Oklahoma reduces child abuse and neglect in care, boosts the number of available foster homes, lowers caseloads and ultimately increases the number of children who ﬁnd permanent families. 
Though this massive effort in Oklahoma involved most of our legal staff and strained  
our resources, we weren’t content to focus on one case. In 2010 and 2011 Children’s Rights ﬁled class-action suits in three new states, and for good reason. T oo many of T exas’ 30,000-plus foster children languish as permanent wards of the state with little hope of having a permanent home. Massachusetts’ foster care system consistently is one of the  10 worst in the nation for child abuse and neglect in care. And Rhode Island’s foster children are too often placed in orphanage-like institutions rather than homes with families. These are just a few of the troubling issues in these states that Children’s Rights is ﬁghting to address.CHILDRE N’S RIGHTS  
REFO RM CAMP AIGNS
Children’s Rights is also monitoring progress 
where we’ve already won substantial reform. In 2011-2012: 
MILWA UKEE  cut the occurrence of abuse and neglect in foster care to an all-time low , 
and reduced caseloads to 15.7 children per worker, another record low . 
WASHING TON, DC  ensured new staff are prepared to work with children and families  
by training 94 percent of social workers within three months of being hired.
CONNECTICUT  reduced by more than half the number of kids under 13 years old living in 
institutions since the beginning of 2011, and at the same time cut the number of children 
sent to out-of-state institutions by 64 percent, from 364 to 131.
MICHIGAN  introduced a university-based training program to prepare new caseworkers  
for their role in assuring child safety , and replaced 83 county-based child abuse hotlines  with one centralized intake system to ensure abuse and neglect reports are addressed timely and consistently . 
NEW JERSEY  recruited and licensed nearly 1,500 foster families in 2011, and began to 
implement its quality review system – giving management an in-depth look at individual cases and allowing staff to review and improve upon their work with families. 
MISSISSIPPI  agreed to a revised settlement plan requiring the child welfare agency to 
take concrete steps to protect children from maltreatment in foster care, improve abuse investigations, and place kids in permanent homes quickly .
My buddy Rocco was adopted by loving 
parents. Thousands of foster kids across the country aren’t so lucky. Children’s Rights knows how to harness the power of the courts to change entire systems for the better, and I’m proud to stand with them.”

with national advocacy, conducting studies 
and issuing major reports to show how better public policy can bring improvements to the lives of children in foster care.
Recent policy projects include:
What Works in Child Welfare Reform: Reducing Reliance  on Congregate Care in Tennessee
 – a comprehensive 2011 study focused 
on T ennessee’s effort to increase the number of children in foster care living with families 
rather than in institutions — such as shelters, group homes, and residential treatment centers. The report shows that the state’s child welfare system has greatly improved its ability to reserve institutional care only for youth with severe mental and behavioral health needs.
Ensuring High-Quality Kinship Care for Children in Wisconsin  –  
a report on Wisconsin’s recent effort to license and train relatives to care for children in state custody , following a legislative change in 2009 requiring relatives caring for foster youth to apply for a foster home license. The report offers speciﬁc recommendations to help ensure that foster youth living with relatives are just as safe as those living with unrelated foster parents. Since it was issued, Wisconsin has committed to evaluate its Level of Care system, which includes the statewide conversion of unlicensed kinship caregivers to licensed kinship foster parents addressed in the report.
