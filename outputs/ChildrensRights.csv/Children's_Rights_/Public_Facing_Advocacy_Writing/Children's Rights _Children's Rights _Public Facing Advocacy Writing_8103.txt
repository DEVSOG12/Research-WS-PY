For youth already in detention, agencies should immediately conduct a case-by-case assessment of every child to determine whether there is a family home where they can be placed, with supportive services, and if the answer is yes, that child should be moved there as quickly as possible. For youth in the foster care system, no new children should be entering group homes or residential treatment facilities, unless there is an acute health need. For children already in group homes and residential facilities, the same case-by-case assessment protocol should be followed. In these times, children need the support of adults who can care for them with love and compassion. It’s got to be families over facilities—now more than ever.”NewsroomPress ReleasesMedia KitPublicationsFact SheetsAging OutChild Abuse and NeglectChild Mental HealthChild Sex TraffickingFinding Permanent FamiliesFoster CareBlogVideosOur MissionWhat We DoYour RightsJoin UsTake ActionDonate NowStay in the KnowStoreNYC BenefitMediaBlogPress ReleasesIn the NewsPublicationsVideosOur Impact2021 Impact ReportClass ActionsOur StoriesTales of Strength & LoveAbout UsEmploymentAnnual Report and Privacy PolicyContact UsDonate NowFacebook Twitter YouTubeDonate Now© 2022 Children’s Rights.
