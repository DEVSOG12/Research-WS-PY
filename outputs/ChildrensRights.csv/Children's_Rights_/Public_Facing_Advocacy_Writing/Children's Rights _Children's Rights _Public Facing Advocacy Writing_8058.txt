A few states — Connecticut, Illinois, California, Rhode Island, Michigan, Ohio, and South Carolina— have already put policies in place to stop youth from aging out during the crisis. Governors who have not yet acted must follow their lead, and do it now.We need the power of your voice to ensure every governor hears the message! Join us in telling governors older youth must not age out.Add Your VoiceToday, Children’s Rights joined national advocates in urging Congress to take action to help older foster youth in and aging out of foster care. Many of these young people have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis, and are at risk of becoming homeless and losing services and supports at a time that they need them the most. In this letter, advocates ask Congress to include in its next COVID-19 relief bill provisions that would provide support for these young people so they can make it through this crisis, stay healthy and thrive.We ask that the following reforms are included:Increase Chafee Funding by $500 millionExtend the Age of Eligibility for Chafee Aftercare Services to Age 23 for All YouthSuspend Participation Requirements for Young People in Extended Foster CarePlace a Moratorium on Discharges from the Foster Care System for Youth Ages 18-21Allow States to Draw Down Title IV-E funds until a Young Person Reaches Age 22We are aware that many young people are suffering from financial hardship at this time. However, unlike their peers, many foster youth have no family or support network to turn to for help navigating these challenges. We ask that you not forget them as you move forward in supporting our nation’s recovery from COVID.Annie Blackledge, The Mockingbird SocietyCeleste Bodner, FosterClubSixto Cancel, Think of UsAlexandra Citrin, Center for the Study of Social PolicySerita Cox, iFosterApril Curtis, Foster Care Alumni of AmericaLisa Dickson & Doris Edelmann, ACTION OhioChristen Glickman, Youth VillagesJessica Haspel, Children NowAmy Harfield & Melanie Delgado, Children’s Advocacy InstituteSherry Lachman.
