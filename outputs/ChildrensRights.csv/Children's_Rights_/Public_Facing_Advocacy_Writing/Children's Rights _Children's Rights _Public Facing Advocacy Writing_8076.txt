The policy would blatantly violate US law and ignore a body of clinical findings that child incarceration leads to potentially irreparable emotional and physical harm to young bodies and minds.”Children’s Rights will continue to hold this government accountable and advocate for the rights of detained children. We must ensure that they receive the safe and humane treatment they deserve.Read Sandy Santana speaking out against this policy proposal in La Opinión.Learn more about Children’s Rights’ legal action and strategic advocacy to reunite migrant children and families here.Sign up for newsletter updates from Children’s Rights:Please leave this field emptyNewsroomPress ReleasesMedia KitPublicationsFact SheetsAging OutChild Abuse and NeglectChild Mental HealthChild Sex TraffickingFinding Permanent FamiliesFoster CareBlogVideosOur MissionWhat We DoYour RightsJoin UsTake ActionDonate NowStay in the KnowStoreNYC BenefitMediaBlogPress ReleasesIn the NewsPublicationsVideosOur Impact2021 Impact ReportClass ActionsOur StoriesTales of Strength & LoveAbout UsEmploymentAnnual Report and Privacy PolicyContact UsDonate NowFacebook Twitter YouTubeDonate Now© 2022 Children’s Rights.
