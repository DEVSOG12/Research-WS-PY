Lack of funding is not a license to flout the Flores settlement and regulations and laws that require the government to promote the health and safety of children in its custody. But more importantly, these are children who have already experienced severe trauma and hardship. The facilities where they are being detained are already prison-like. Now we are telling them they cannot go to school, run in the playground or access a lawyer. We are telling them, yes, you are in jail. Congress and the administration need to work together to provide funding for these vital services and the administration must move quickly place children with sponsors – and stop traumatizing innocent children.”###Stay informed about our fight for neglected and abused children across the nation—join our e-mail list for updates.NewsroomPress ReleasesMedia KitPublicationsFact SheetsAging OutChild Abuse and NeglectChild Mental HealthChild Sex TraffickingFinding Permanent FamiliesFoster CareBlogVideosOur MissionWhat We DoYour RightsJoin UsTake ActionDonate NowStay in the KnowStoreNYC BenefitMediaBlogPress ReleasesIn the NewsPublicationsVideosOur Impact2021 Impact ReportClass ActionsOur StoriesTales of Strength & LoveAbout UsEmploymentAnnual Report and Privacy PolicyContact UsDonate NowFacebook Twitter YouTubeDonate Now© 2022 Children’s Rights.
