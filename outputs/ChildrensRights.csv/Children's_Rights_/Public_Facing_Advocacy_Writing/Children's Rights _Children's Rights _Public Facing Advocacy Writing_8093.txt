This is the latest effort by Gov. Abbott to criminalize medical care for transgender youth.Daniele Gerard, Senior Staff Attorney at Children’s Rights, issued a statement in response:“Children’s Rights condemns this abhorrent, discriminatory directive from the Governor of Texas that risks causing irreparable harm to the entire transgender community in Texas. This calculated political ploy to identify and punish so-called “child abuse” is also deeply hypocritical, given that for years Texas state officials, including Governor Abbott, have knowingly operated a child welfare system that inflicts abuse on the very children it is charged with protecting. If Governor Abbott and other Texas leaders really cared about children, they would focus their efforts on repairing the egregious harm they cause every day, rather than cruelly penalizing transgender children and their families for seeking affirming healthcare. Children’s Rights will continue to advocate for these children to ensure that LGBTQ youth are connected with safe and loving homes and have access to the resources they need.”###ABOUT CHILDREN’S RIGHTSEvery day, children are harmed in America’s broken child welfare, juvenile justice, education, and healthcare systems.
