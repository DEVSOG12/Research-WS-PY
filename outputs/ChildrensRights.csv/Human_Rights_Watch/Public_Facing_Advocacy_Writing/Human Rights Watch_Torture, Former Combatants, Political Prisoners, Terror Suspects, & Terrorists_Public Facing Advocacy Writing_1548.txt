And we understand your concern about reaction to them overseas.  But suppressing information to prevent public anger is inconsistent with democratic principles. The Pentagon should release the photos while reaffirming to the world that the U.S. repudiates such barbaric behavior and is committed to dismantling the culture that allowed it to occur. In the end, full disclosure of the crimes committed by our government will make us all safer.The last eight years have demonstrated all too painfully that excessive secrecy creates a fertile environment for grave abuses.  Those abuses have tarnished our nation's reputation and damaged its security.  We will restore our standing as a leader on human rights not by hiding images of our failures, but by demonstrating that those failures will not go unpunished.As you yourself have stated, "the Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears."   Suppressing photographs of abuse places your administration on the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of history.  We hope you will reconsider your decision.Sincerely,Alliance for JusticeAmerican Civil Liberties UnionAmnesty InternationalBill of Rights Defense CommitteeCenter for Constitutional RightsCenter for Human Rights and Global Justice, NYU School of LawCenter for the Study of Human Rights in the AmericasCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)CREDO MobileElectronic Frontier FoundationFeminists for Free ExpressionGovernment Accountability ProjectHuman Rights WatchInternational Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ)Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action (JALSA)Leitner Center for International Law and Justice at Fordham Law SchoolNational Security ArchiveOMB WatchOpenTheGovernment.orgPEN American CenterPhysicians for Human RightsProgressive Librarians Guild (PLG)Reporters Without BordersThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the PressUnited Methodist Church, General Board of Church and SocietyVeterans for Common SenseVeterans For PeaceYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism TortureRelated content2009_CT_torturephotosltr.pdfMore ReadingMay 13, 2009News ReleaseUS: Reversal on Torture Photos a Blow to Openness, AccountabilityMay 13, 2009Q & AAccountability for TortureReportsFebruary 5, 2020ReportDeported to DangerUnited States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and AbuseJuly 25, 2017Report“I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me”Medically Unnecessary Surgeries on Intersex Children in the USMore ReadingMay 13, 2009News ReleaseUS: Reversal on Torture Photos a Blow to Openness, AccountabilityMay 13, 2009Q & AAccountability for TortureMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
