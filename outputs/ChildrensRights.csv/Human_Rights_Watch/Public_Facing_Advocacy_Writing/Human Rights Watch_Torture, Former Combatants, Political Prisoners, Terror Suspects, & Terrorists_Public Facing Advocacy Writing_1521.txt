The interim report of the Detainee Inquiry, which highlights that the evidence it received indicates UK agents were aware of abuse of some detainees by other governments and that the UK government may have been involved in rendition and outlines 27 separate issues that should be subject to further investigation, only strengthens this call.  We urge the government to make its replies to these 27 issues public.We believe that the ISC is wholly unsuited to the task of carrying out an investigation of these issues and that as a result, any investigation it conducts is unlikely to get to the truth. We are therefore seeking clarity as to how the government believes it is possible to reconcile the limitations inherent in the ISC’s mandate and powers with the obligation under international law that the government conduct an independent, effective, thorough and impartial investigation into serious human rights violations that would be open to public scrutiny and allow for adequate victim participation.Our previous objection to the Detainee Inquiry was that it fell short of the UK's international human rights obligations and domestic obligations under the Human Rights Act to fully and independently investigate allegations of UK involvement in torture and other ill-treatment. The most concerning aspects of its design were that the government retained final say on what material could be disclosed to the public and that the protocol did not provide for an independent mechanism to decide on disclosure of national security material.These concerns remain – indeed are all the more obvious – with respect to the ISC. Although the Justice and Security Act 2013 provided the ISC with some further powers, the membership and activities of the ISC remain under the control of the Prime Minister, who holds an absolute veto over who sits on the committee and what information it is allowed to see and publish. For example, the government retains the right to withhold information considered to be “sensitive” or on grounds of national security.[iii] The definition of what constitutes sensitive information is extremely broad and notably includes information provided by a foreign intelligence agency which can object to further disclosure of that information.[iv]Moreover, one of the issues that should be subject to investigation is the effectiveness of the oversight of the UK intelligence and security agencies during the relevant period. This would presumably include the role of the ISC and its previous failure to investigate these allegations in an effective and transparent manner when, in 2007, it reported that there was “no evidence that the UK Agencies were complicit in any ‘Extraordinary Rendition’ operations.”[v]We note that the government has left open the possibility of a judge-led inquiry in the future, following the ISC investigation and the conclusion of select criminal investigations, providing that such an inquiry would add “further information of value to future policy making and the national interest”.However, this does not address the concerns that we have regarding the ISC investigation highlighted above.Furthermore, we do not see any compelling reason why the process of establishing and commencing the work of an independent judicial inquiry cannot run parallel to current criminal investigations. The inquiry would address a broader range of issues than the criminal investigations and could begin work solely on those issues until the criminal investigations are concluded.We are sharing a copy of this letter, as indicated below, with the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee.We would be grateful for a response to the concerns raised in this letter and look forward to your reply.
