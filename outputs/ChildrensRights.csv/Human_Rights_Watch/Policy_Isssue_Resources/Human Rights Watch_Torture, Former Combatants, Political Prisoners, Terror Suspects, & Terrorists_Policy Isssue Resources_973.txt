The government had taken significant steps to curtail the use oftorture and other ill-treatment by its security officials, and reports of suchpractices became a rarity. This report concludes, however, that since the endof 2007, officials again have used torture and ill-treatment, particularlyduring the interrogation of security suspects.  Human Rights Watch’sconclusion is based on interviews with former detainees and others, as well as itsreview of government documents.This reversion to past practices came as political tensions rosein Bahrain. Street demonstrations involving young men from the country’smajority Shia Muslim community protesting alleged discrimination by theSunni-dominated government deteriorated with increasing regularity intoconfrontations, sometimes violent, with security forces. Arrests oftenfollowed. Security officials appear to have utilized a specific repertoire oftechniques against many of those arrested designed to inflict pain and elicitconfessions.These techniques included the use of electro-shock devices,suspension in painful positions, beating the soles of the feet (falaka), and beatings of the head, torso,and limbs. Some detainees also reported that security officials had threatenedto kill them or to rape them or members of their families. Many detainees weresubjected to more than one of these practices. The use of these techniques,separately and in combination, violates Bahrain’s obligations as a stateparty to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumanor Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention against Torture) and otherinternational treaties, as well as the prohibition of torture in Bahraini law.* * *For many years, government opponentshave chosen December 16—Bahrain’s National Day—and the daysleading up to it as an opportune time to mount street protests. December2007 saw protests in a number of Shia neighborhoods and villages around thecapital, Manama. When a young protestor died—opposition activists chargehe was asphyxiated by security forces’ excessive use of tear gas, whileofficials claim he died of natural causes—the confrontations intensified.In one village, Jidhafs, protestors torched a security forces vehicle andallegedly stole from it an assault rifle and ammunition. Scores of arrestsfollowed, and in subsequent weeks Bahraini human rights activists reportedclaims from detainees, relayed by family members and later by defense lawyers,that security forces had subjected those arrested to severe beatings,electro-shock devices, prolonged suspension in painful positions, and otherforms of abuse that amounted to torture or otherwise illegal treatment.Officials categorically denied that security forces committed any such acts.The large-scale arrests in response to the December 2007events led to further cycles of protest and arrest. In March 2008, securityforces arrested at least eight young men from around the village of Karzakan,about 20 kilometers south of Manama, following what officials claimed was anarson attack on nearby property belonging to a member of the ruling Al Khalifafamily (specifically, a former head of the National Security Agency, or NSA,the security service most directly involved in suppressing the street protests).Security forces arrested some 30 young men in the same area a month later, whenclashes between protestors and security forces left an NSA vehicle in flamesand a Pakistani NSA officer dead, although the circumstances of his deathbecame the subject of some dispute. Further allegations of torture andill-treatment were made by these detainees, followed by further governmentdenials.December 2008 saw additional arrests, this time ofapproximately 35 men who, the authorities claimed, had traveled to Syria toreceive training in the use of explosives and other forms of sabotage, or hadbeen recruited by the leaders of the opposition Haq Movement for Liberty andDemocracy to carry out attacks on property and foment violence. These detaineestoo, through family members and defense lawyers, complained that they had beensubjected to torture and ill-treatment. The Public Prosecution Office broadcasta program on state-run television in which 11 of these detainees madestatements that purported to be confessions confirming the government’sallegations and implicating leaders of the Haq Movement as the organizers of aplanned campaign to stage violent protests and destroy property. Three HaqMovement leaders were also arrested, but did not allege that they themselveshad been subjected to physical abuse.At court hearings involving many of those arrested inconnection with the above-described incidents, defendants raised allegations oftorture.  In several cases the court ordered that government doctorsconduct medical examinations of those who complained of torture; in a goodnumber of instances, the government doctors found evidence of injuriesconsistent with the detainees’ allegations.On April 11, 2009, government officials announced that Bahrain’sruler, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, had granted a “pardon” to178 persons then in custody, including many who had been detained in connectionwith the aforementioned incidents. Those subject to the pardon included personsalready convicted and persons whose trials were ongoing. Although governmentofficials, and the Bahraini media, referred to the king’s initiative as apardon, it was never published in the Official Gazette and it appears to havebeen more of a suspension of sentences and court proceedings, which mightbe—and for some individuals were—subsequently reinstated.However conditional the pardon may have been, the release ofthese detainees presented an opportunity for Human Rights Watch to interviewthem regarding their treatment in detention and particularly duringinterrogation. Two Human Rights Watch researchers visited Bahrain from June 6to June 15, 2009, and met with 20 former detainees: 10 from the December 2007incidents in Jidhafs; three from February, March and April 2008 incidents inand around Karzakan; and seven who had been arrested in December 2008. A numberof other former detainees indicated that they did not feel comfortable meetingwith Human Rights Watch. According to Bahraini human rights and oppositionactivists, authorities had warned former detainees that there might berepercussions for speaking with media or outside investigators.Human Rights Watch also met with defense lawyers, localhuman rights activists, local journalists, and government officials. In addition,Human Rights Watch acquired medical reports written by Bahraini governmentdoctors regarding the physical condition of detainees, court documents, andreports generated by the security services and prosecutors.Most of the former detainees who spoke with Human RightsWatch said that they had been subjected to torture and ill-treatment at theheadquarters of the Ministry of Interior’s General Directorate ofCriminal Investigation (CID) in Adliya, a neighborhood of the capital; at theMinistry of Interior’s Short-Term Detention Unit, also known as Dry Dockbecause of its proximity to a ship repair yard; and/or at the offices of theNSA, also on the grounds of the Ministry of Interior. The NSA and the Ministryof Interior both report to the Supreme Defense Council, a 14-member body thatis drawn entirely from the ruling family and headed by the prime minister.Several of the detainees had also been brought in front ofprosecutors who failed to respond appropriately to their complaints of ill-treatment.In a number of instances prosecutors failed to record complaints, orderforensic medical examinations, or launch any investigation into adetainee’s allegations. In some cases, prosecutors returned detainees tothe custody of the same security officers allegedly responsible for the abusein the first place. Other prosecutors did appropriately send detainees formedical exams when the detainees complained of torture.Officials with the Ministry of Interior and the PublicProsecution Office, in separate meetings with Human Rights Watch, denied thattorture had been employed against those detained in connection with theincidents referenced above. They said the consistency in the accounts of theformer detainees, as discussed below, reflected the fact that the detainees hadbeen imprisoned together and had consulted the same defense lawyers. In theopinion of these officials, the consistency of the allegations was evidencethat the allegations had been fabricated. The public prosecutor told HumanRights Watch that, as far as he could recall, he had not referred anycomplaints of torture to the Ministry of Interior for consideration in relationto the former detainees whose cases are described here. At this writing, inJanuary 2010, Human Rights Watch had received no response to letters to theMinistry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior raising detailed questionsabout government policies with regard to torture and ill-treatment. (Theseletters are reproduced in the appendix to this report.)Human Rights Watch found the accounts of torture andill-treatment documented in this report to be credible. These accounts wereconsistent as to the specific techniques employed by security services, whichsupports their credibility. Further, the accounts of abuse provided to HumanRights Watch matched those that detainees had offered earlier in courtproceedings and to their defense counsel. In addition, contrary to theassertions of government officials, there is evidence that some if not alldetainees had been held in solitary confinement at the time they first reportedabuse, reducing the opportunities for them to fabricate accounts prior to makingsuch reports; with respect to the December 2008 detainees, a court ordered thatthey be removed from solitary confinement in March 2009, after they already hadcomplained to the court and their lawyers about abuse. The detainees alsodescribed in consistent terms various interrogation techniques that, whiledeceptive, did not constitute torture or ill-treatment. None alleged, moreover,that they suffered abuse continuously, and for the most part they did notallege that abuse took place other than in connection with interrogations (orin some cases at the point of arrest).Most significantly, the medical reports of governmentdoctors, along with various court papers, provided the strongest corroborationof the former detainees’ allegations. In fact, the court in one of theKarzakan cases acquitted all defendants on all charges in part because itconcluded—on the basis of medical reports—that the defendants hadbeen physically coerced into confessing.* * *Bahrain undertook significant reforms after Shaikh Hamadsucceeded his father as ruler (amir, or prince) in 1999. Not the least of thesewere reforms affecting the security services and the administration of justice.Shaikh Hamad freed thousands of political prisoners and invited the return ofhundreds of citizens who had been forcibly exiled. Structural changes includedmoving the Public Prosecution Office from the jurisdiction of the Ministry ofInterior to that of the Ministry of Justice. Perhaps the most significant reformwas the abolition of the State Security Court that the government had used forthe previous quarter-century to imprison political opponents following closedtrials that did not meet international fair trial standards. The State SecurityCourt, which lacked any independence from the executive branch, typicallyrelied on confessions obtained by physical coercion. Beyond these reforms, thegovernment ratified the Convention against Torture, and invited a delegation ofthe UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions to visit the country.A more negative development was the October 2002 decree issuedby Shaikh Hamad (who in the meantime had promoted himself to king) effectivelygranting amnesty from criminal investigation or prosecution to officialsalleged to have ordered or carried out serious crimes such as torture.Nonetheless, while Bahrain had been notorious between 1975 and1999 as a country where torture was a serious and systemic problem (as HumanRights Watch and other international human rights organizations documented),reports of torture or ill-treatment in detention were scarce after 1999. By 2005,when Bahrain belatedly presented its first report to the UN Committee againstTorture (international experts who review the compliance of state parties tothe Convention against Torture), it seemed that the government couldlegitimately claim to have ceased the practice of torture. Indeed, while HumanRights Watch did document serious abuses over the last decade, such as beatingsby security forces at the point of arrest, complaints of torture in detentionor during interrogation had grown quite rare—until recently.It should be noted that while Bahraini government agentsbegan to employ torture again in late 2007, the fact that government doctors arenow able to provide corroboration of torture and ill-treatment marks a major improvementfrom the era of routine torture that characterized Bahrain in the 1980s and1990s.  During those years, doctors were intimidated from issuing reportsthat corroborated allegations of abuse, if medical examinations were conductedat all.* * *Human Rights Watch urges the government of Bahrain to takeprompt action to ensure that torture and ill-treatment are once againeradicated from the practices of security officials. The government should conductprompt and impartial investigations into all allegations of torture orill-treatment by security officials of any rank in the CID or the NSA (or othersecurity services), and prosecute any offenders to the full extent of the lawin a court meeting international fair trial standards. More specifically, suchprosecutions should occur before an independent civilian court, rather than thePolice Court of the Ministry of Interior, where such prosecutions—to theextent they occur at all—now take place.HumanRights Watch also urges the government to suspend immediately any securityofficial if credible evidence exists that such official ordered, carried out,or condoned acts of torture or ill-treatment. The government shouldfurther commence investigations into whether prosecutors, including those namedin this report, responded appropriately to allegations of torture or whethertheir actions rendered them complicit in acts of abuse. If there is credibleevidence that a prosecutor or other state agent was complicit in torture orill-treatment, the government should pursue appropriate sanctions.Human Rights Watch also calls on theUnited States, France, and the United Kingdom, countries with significantsecurity links to Bahrain, to urge the government of Bahrain to take immediateand measurable steps to end the use of torture by the country’s securityforces. France and the United Kingdom in particular have training andassistance arrangements with Bahrain’s NSA and the Ministry of Interior,respectively. Thus, these countries may riskbeing implicated in prohibited practices and violating their own legalobligations if they cooperate with law enforcement forces they know or shouldknow are employing torture or other ill-treatment.KeyRecommendationsTo the Government of BahrainInvestigate promptly and impartially all allegations oftorture or ill-treatment by security or law enforcement officials of anyrank, and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law, in a court thatmeets international fair trial standards, any official found responsiblefor ordering, carrying out, or acquiescing in torture or ill-treatment.Immediately suspend any security or law enforcementofficial when credible evidence exists showing that such official ordered,carried out, or acquiesced in acts of torture or ill-treatment.Ensure that victims of torture or ill-treatment receiveappropriate compensation from the government and those officialsresponsible in accordance with Bahraini law.To the Member States of the Arab LeagueCall upon Bahrain to respect and comply with article 8 ofthe Arab Charter on Human Rights, which prohibits subjecting any person totorture or cruel, degrading, humiliating, or inhuman treatment. To the Governments of theUnited States, France, and the United KingdomUrge Bahrain to enact and comply with the recommendationsof this report. Bearing in mind their own legal obligations with respectto the absolute prohibition of torture, make clear that close relationswith Bahrain, including the provision of training to Bahraini securityforces, will depend on the Bahraini government’s taking measurablesteps to stop torture in places of detention and to end impunity for thoseofficials who order, carry out, or acquiesce in such acts. To the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human RightsRequest an invitation from the government to visit Bahrainto discuss allegations of torture and other issues of concern. To the Member States of theUnited Nations Human Rights CouncilQuestion thegovernment of Bahrain on reported cases of torture or ill-treatment inlight of the government’s statement during its Universal PeriodicReview in April 2008 that there are no cases of torture in the country. I. MethodologyHuman Rights Watch visited Bahrain in June 2009 andinterviewed 20 individuals who had been detained by Bahraini security forcesover the prior 18 months, beginning in December 2007. Mostof those interviewed had been released in mid-April 2009, when the king issueda pardon freeing 178 persons who had been detained on security-related charges.[1]Of the 20 individuals interviewed, 10 had been detained inconnection with violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces inJidhafs village in December 2007 (Jidhafs case). Two had been detained inconnection with incidents in March and April 2008 in and around Karzakanvillage (Karzakan case).Human Rights Watch also interviewed a detainee who had beenarrested in February near Karzakan in connection with a separate incident. Theremaining seven had been detained in connection with a case known asal-Hujaira, the name of a district in Damascus, Syria, where the defendants hadallegedly gone to train in making explosives (al-Hujaira case). The cases areexplained in more detail in the next chapter.The majority of the individuals interviewed had beeninvolved with committees or groups—such as the Unemployment and LowIncome Committee, and the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy—that areassociated with the opposition movement and whose members are drawn largelyfrom the country’s majority Shia Muslim population. Some individuals had notbeen involved with such committees or groups, but regularly attended oppositionrallies and protests. Observant to varying degrees, all 20 individualsinterviewed are Shia Muslims.Human Rights Watch attempted to meet with other individualsdetained in connection with these cases, but many did not speak with us forfear of retribution. Several of those we did meet with spoke to us on thecondition that we not identify them. Many of those we interviewed said thatBahraini officials had warned them not to speak about their treatment incustody.Human Rights Watch also spoke with several of the defenseattorneys in the Jidhafs, Karzakan, and Hujaira cases as well as Bahrainijournalists and human rights activists. In addition, Human Rights Watchinterviewed officials from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry ofInterior.Human Rights Watch conducted all interviews in English, orin Arabic with the assistance of a translator.Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents and recordsgenerated by the Bahraini courts, the Public Prosecution Office, and securityforces. Further, Human Rights Watch examined medical reports authored bygovernment doctors regarding complaints of mistreatment by individuals detainedin connection with these cases.[2]II.BackgroundBahrain, a small island nation, lies along the Persian Gulfcoast of the Arabian Peninsula, linked to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia by a25-kilometer causeway. The current population is approximately 800,000, ofwhich just under half are Bahraini nationals, with the remainder comprisingworkers and professionals from abroad (mostly from other Arab countries orSouth Asia).[3]Bahraini nationals are almost all Muslims; while approximately 60 percent ofthem are Shia, the ruling Al Khalifa family is Sunni, and political control,including the security forces, is solidly in Sunni hands.Bahrain was the site of the first Persian Gulf commercialoil discovery, in 1932. Bahrain’s production capacity is extremely modestcompared with that of its neighbors, but its oil revenues (and longtime role asthe eastern gateway to Saudi Arabia) allowed for the creation of a modern stateapparatus prior to that of most neighboring states. In recent decades Bahrainhas played a role as a financial services center, in competition with Dubai andother near neighbors.Britain ruled Bahrain from 1868 until 1971, and Bahrainserved as a base for the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. Today Bahrain isthe headquarters of the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet and is a supportbase for US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.The Shia-Sunni sectarian divide is a major element in thecountry’s political dynamic. Shia spokespersons charge that although theyare a solid majority of the citizenry they have been largely excluded frompositions of significant authority, particularly in the political and securityrealms. The authorities dispute claims of systemic discrimination, but also areopenly suspicious regarding the national loyalties of many Shia.[4]Notably, the internal security services are comprised of a high proportion ofnon-Bahrainis—Jordanians, Egyptians, and other Arabs as well asPakistanis—almost all of whom are Sunni. Also, the Shia oppositionclaims, and the government denies, that Bahraini authorities recruit these (andother) non-Bahraini Sunnis to become citizens in an effort to alter thesectarian population balance.[5]Bahrain’s political system is distinctlyauthoritarian. Following independence, a partially elected constituent assemblydrew up a constitution, promulgated in 1972, that established a NationalAssembly, which was two-thirds elected. The country’s first electionswere held in 1973. But just two years later, in 1975, the then-ruler, ShaikhIsa, dissolved the National Assembly after it refused to endorse a draconian statesecurity law that, among other things, permitted arbitrary arrests andincommunicado detention, and created a State Security Court that effectivelysuspended those portions of the constitution guaranteeing due process rights.In the midst of a subsequent political crisis in the 1990s, arising mainly fromopposition demands to reinstate the National Assembly, the Bahraini informationminister said that the National Assembly had been dissolved because it“hindered the government.”[6]Bahrain undertook significant political reforms after ShaikhHamad bin Isa Al Khalifa succeeded his father as ruler in March 1999.[7]These included abolishing the State Security Court, freeing more than 1,300persons detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression andassociation, and inviting scores of citizens forcibly exiled for politicalreasons to return. At least one returning exile later became a cabinetminister, and another the editor of the country’s first independent dailynewspaper. Authorities also showed a greater tolerance for publicdemonstrations protesting government policies.In February 2001, Bahrainis, inoverwhelming numbers, approved by referendum a National Charter proposed byShaikh Hamad that elevated his title from amir (prince) to king andendorsed an elected National Assembly.[8]But exactly a year later the king unilaterally decreed a revised constitutionthat established an appointed Shura (consultative) Council alongside, andenjoying essentially co-equal powers with, the elected Assembly. Theopposition, Shia and Sunni alike, considered this move a betrayal of theNational Charter.[9]In 2002, Bahrain held its first elections to the National Assembly in more thana quarter-century, but most of the opposition refused to contest the electionand many boycotted the vote.[10]Many Bahrainis remained unhappy with the king’speremptory and unilateral revisions to the country’s constitution, andthe very limited prerogatives of their elected representatives.[11]There was also a failure to institutionalize many reforms in law. However,during much of the past decade, it at least had become possible in Bahrain toprotest publicly, and in association with others, as well as to advocate foradditional reforms—a state of affairs that had not existed for the prior25 years.Not the least of the reforms implemented by the Bahrainigovernment since 1999 was ending the routine practice of torturing detainees—particularlypolitical detainees—during interrogation. Torture and arbitrary detentionhad become routine beginning in 1975, when the ruling Al Khalifa familysuspended the 1973 constitution and conducted mass arrests of its critics. Afterthe Iranian revolution of 1979 the situation grew increasingly polarized alongsectarian lines between the majority Shia population and the Sunni minority,which, as discussed, included the Al Khalifa family, the heads of the varioussecurity services, and the courts.Repression intensified further in 1981, when the governmentconducted widespread arrests of Shia after it said it had uncovered a plot toreplace the Al Khalifa rulers with an Islamic republic modeled on Iran. Anotherwave of repression began in late 1994, when demonstrations and unrest beganerupting regularly in Shia neighborhoods and villages around demands to restorethe 1973 constitution and partially-elected parliament, as well as demands forjobs.In an investigation published in 1997, based on interviewswith former detainees as well as defense lawyers, Human Rights Watch found that“[s]ystematic beating as well as other forms of physical andpsychological abuse of detainees are pervasive in Bahrain.”[12]Between 1994 and 1998, Human Rights Watch received reports of at least sevendeaths in custody due to torture, mistreatment, or medical neglect.[13]These episodes occurred despite the fact that Bahrain’s constitution andpenal code categorically prohibited any use of torture. Indeed, governmentofficials at the time asserted that allegations of torture were “simplynot true, and propagandist in nature,” and that there were“internal procedures for the investigation of complaints about thepolice.”[14]Nonetheless, at no point are Bahraini authorities known to have conducted aninvestigation into alleged torture, or disciplined or punished any official inconnection with such allegations.[15]Several developments beginning in 1998 indicated thatBahrain’s rulers had decided to address directly the problem of tortureand mistreatment. That year the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)conducted prison visits for the first time.[16]Also in 1998 the government ratified the Convention against Torture, and agreedto a visit by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which took place in2001.In a related (but negative) development, Shaikh Hamad issuedDecree 56 in July 2002. The government characterized this decree as providing a“general amnesty” for the purpose of “closing a chapter onthe past and helping to create a climate conducive to the enjoyment of publicfreedoms.”[17]The primary effect of Decree 56/2002 was to confer on present and formergovernment officials immunity from criminal investigation or prosecution foralleged acts of torture or other serious human rights abuses.[18]The king issued the decree prior to the opening of the new National Assembly,with the intent of preempting any attempts by newly elected representatives todelve into such matters. The UN Committee Against Torture subsequentlycriticized the amnesty decree as well as the inadequate availability ofcompensation and rehabilitation for victims of torture. The Committee AgainstTorture also took issue with the absence of data on complaints of torture andill-treatment, and the absence of data regarding investigations andprosecutions undertaken in response to such complaints.[19]Notwithstanding the issues raisedby the Committee Against Torture, there were few complaints of torture indetention in Bahrain between 2000 and the end of 2007 (although Bahraini humanrights defenders did report incidents during this period in which protestorswere beaten at demonstrations or at the point of arrest). Since December 2007,however, reports of abusive interrogation and detention practices haveincreased. For example, in July2008, Human Rights Watch noted credible allegations that a group of politicalactivists arrested in December 2007 had been convicted of crimes (in theJidhafs case) on the basis of coerced confessions.[20]Specifically, the activists alleged that security officials had subjected themto torture, including sexual assault. The US State Department’s report onhuman rights practices in Bahrain in 2008 reported widespread arrests atprotests and that those arrested alleged they were subjected to abuses indetention.[21]In addition, Bahraini human rights activists began to report an increase incomplaints of serious abuse and torture from certain detainees.In response to increasing complaints of torture andill-treatment in 2008, the Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS), alegally-recognized association, requested permission from the PublicProsecution Office to visit the detention facilities of the General Directorateof Criminal Investigation (CID). The CID is housed at a Ministry of Interiorcompound in the Adliya district of Manama. Abdulla al-Derazi, who heads theBHRS, told Human Rights Watch that the Public Prosecution Office respondedpositively in January 2008 to its request, but then withdrew permission whenthe BHRS insisted that physicians be part of the team to visit Adliya. Derazisaid that the BHRS has since made periodic requests to visit detention sitesimmediately after learning of arrests, but to date permission has not beenforthcoming. “They usually don’t respond,” Derazi said.[22]Bahrain’sSecurity Forces and Law Enforcement ApparatusThe CID is an agency of the Ministry of Interior, whichcomprises directorates of Criminal Investigation, Forensic Evidence, EconomicCrimes Prevention, and Narcotics Prevention. The office of theinspector-general of the Ministry of Interior includes a Directorate ofComplaints and Human Rights.[23]There is also an Office of Public Security, which supervises regular police.The Ministry of Interior administers jails and other placesof detention under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice. The formerdetainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report testified that forthe most part abuse occurred at CID headquarters in Adliya, where authoritieshold persons suspected of serious crimes pending investigations, and in theShort-Term Detention Unit, which Bahrainis commonly refer to as Dry Dock.[24]Several former detainees told Human Rights Watch that theyhad been arrested by Special Forces, referring to the Special Security Forcesunder the command of the National Security Agency (NSA).[25]Shaikh Hamad issued Decree 14 in May 2002, by which the NSA replaced theGeneral Directorate for State Security Investigations, in the Ministry ofInterior. The NSA, while not formally part of the Ministry of Interior, hasoffices in Interior Ministry headquarters. Its director, currently Khalifa bin Abdullah Al Khalifa,has cabinet rank and is a member, along with the minister of interior, of theSupreme Defense Council, headed by the prime minister, Shaikh Khalifa binSalman Al Khalifa.According to the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), theNSA has arrested numerous political activists and engaged in attacks ondemonstrators.[26]In late 2008 the king amended Decree 14/2002 to give NSA forces equivalentstatus to public security forces and to make military courts the only venue forprosecuting NSA personnel.[27]This made it impossible, for instance, for someone to file a civil or criminalcomplaint against the NSA or any of its forces.Special Security Forces take persons they have arrested toone of several possible sites for pre-investigation detention, including theCID detention site in Adliya and the Manama Police Fort, which is on thegrounds of the Ministry of Interior headquarters. Several former detainees toldHuman Rights Watch that Special Security Forces officers subjected them totorture and abuse at an NSA facility.[28]The great majority of Special Security Forces are reportedly recruited fromother Arab countries and Pakistan;[29]the BCHR claims that there are no Bahraini Shia in the ranks of the SpecialSecurity Forces, and that the only Bahraini Shia working for the NSA are asmall number of informants and persons holding low-level positions.[30]We note that Bahrain’s minister of interior, ShaikhRashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, during a visit to France in late November 2007signed a cooperation agreement under which French police officers working withthe Compagnie Republicaine de Securite (CRS) have provided training for theSpecial Security Forces in controlling street demonstrations.[31]Moreover, the United Kingdom, whose nationals had once been deeplyimplicated in abuses by Bahraini security forces, today provides threefull-time advisors from Bramshill, the UK police staff college, in the areas ofcriminal investigation, forensic science, and community policing.[32]Bahrain’s security relationship with the United States mainly involvesthe US’s provision of training and equipment for the Bahrain DefenseForces, which have not been involved in suppressing demonstrations or otherinternal security matters. Bahrain is headquarters for the US Navy’sFifth Fleet, and in 2003 the US designated Bahrain as a major non-NATO ally.Cases Giving Rise to Torture ComplaintsThe former detainees whom Human Rights Watch interviewedwere among those detained in the Jidhafs, Karzakan, and Hujaira cases, the circumstances of whichare detailed below. As mentioned in the previous chapter, most of theseindividuals had been released as a result of a pardon issued by the king inApril 2009. As the procedural history of the Karzakan case makes clear, thepardon did not constitute an amnesty or preclude the prosecution of criminalcases, but rather suspended certain proceedings and allowed for the releasefrom custody of certain individuals at least temporarily.[33]According to one of the defense attorneys in the Hujaira case, the authoritiescan reinstate the suspended proceedings at any time.[34]In fact, the trial of certain defendants in the Karzakan case recommenced afterbeing suspended on the basis of the pardon and concluded on October 13, 2009,with the dismissal of all charges against the defendants, as discussed ingreater detail below.[35]JidhafscaseIn mid-December 2007 protestors held a series ofdemonstrations in and around Manama, including in the largely Shia village ofJidhafs, in response to alleged abuses by security forces. On December 17 AliJassim Makki, a protestor, died following one confrontation betweendemonstrators and security forces, and clashes involving protestors andsecurity forces grew more intense.[36]During clashes on December 21, protestors apparently set fire to an emptypolice vehicle and allegedly stole a weapon from the vehicle.[37]In a statement on December 26, the Ministry of Interiordescribed the incidents as “a cycle of unlicensed and unauthorizedrallies” that “tended to quickly degenerate into violence andvandalism.” The statement added that there were “very fewarrests,” and that those arrested would face charges of arson andvandalism.[38]According to the opposition Haq Movement, authorities detained 48 personsbetween December 17 and December 27.[39]In July 2008, the First Supreme Criminal Court sentenced 11 of the 15individuals who ultimately had been charged in the Jidhafs case to jail termsfor offenses that included illegal assembly, arson, attacking security forces,and illegal possession of weapons.[40]Those who had been imprisoned on the basis of these convictions were freedpursuant to the king’s pardon.KarzakancaseThere were two events near the village of Karzakan that forjudicial purposes were initially treated as related. The first, on March 6,2008, involved a fire allegedly set on the farm of Shaikh Abd al-AzizAttiyatallah Al Khalifa, a ruling family member and the head of the NSA fromits establishment in 2002 until September 2005. The other incident, on April 9,involved clashes between demonstrators and security forces in which an unmarkedpolice vehicle was set afire. A plainclothes Pakistani officer with the NSA,Majid Asghar Ali, died, although apparently not as a result of being trapped inthe burning vehicle, as authorities claimed. The Public Prosecution Officecharged 15 individuals in connection with the alleged arson on the farm, and 19in connection with the torching of the police vehicle and the death of thePakistani officer. The charges included arson and participation in illegalgatherings.[41]Although the First Supreme Criminal Court initiallyconsolidated the two cases, the matters were ultimately severed. The caseinvolving the alleged arson attack on the farm was suspended on April 12, 2009pursuant to the king’s pardon and has not recommenced. Also on April 12,2009, the court suspended the case concerning the death of the NSA officer.[42]However, that matter resumed in May 2009 and, as mentioned, concluded inOctober 2009 with the acquittal of all defendants on all charges.[43]One of the individuals Human Rights Watch interviewed, aresident of a village near Karzakan, had been detained in early February 2008in connection with an alleged earlier arson attack against property belongingto another member of the ruling family. He was released following an initialcourt hearing that was not part of the Karzakan case.Al-HujairacaseDuring the last two weeks of December 2008, security forcesarrested approximately 35 individuals, including prominent opposition leadersHassan Mushaima and Shaikh Muhammad Habib al-Moqdad.[44]The Public Prosecution Office accused these individuals of establishing anillegal group for the purpose of undermining the constitution of Bahrain,hindering public authorities from performing their duties, and violating therights of citizens, including through terrorism. The defendants were alsocharged with unauthorized weapons and explosives training.[45]Authorities asserted that many of the defendants had received this training inal-Hujaira, Damascus.[46]On December 28, 2008, state-controlled television broadcasta compilation of excerpts from taped conversations in which 11 of thedefendants appeared to admit to involvement in a range of allegedlyterrorism-related activities and to carrying out violent acts at an oppositionrally earlier in December.[47]The broadcast assembled brief elements of the statements, shifting from onedefendant to another and back again, without at any point naming thedefendants, although their faces were shown. The broadcast also included scenesof rioting and voice-over commentary about the threat of terrorism.[48]Two daily newspapers, the pro-government Al-Ayyamand the independent Al-Waqt,printed what appear to be complete transcripts of the program the next day,December 29, and named those defendants who allegedly confessed.[49]In their broadcast statements, the defendants talked about their putativerecruitment, preparation, and training, and said that attacks were planned tocoincide with important national holidays. They also implicated Hassan Mushaimaas being responsible for inciting such activities and violence.[50]A Bahraini court discontinued the prosecution of this caseindefinitely (and before verdict) on April 28, 2009, based upon theking’s pardon.[51]III.Legal FrameworkBahrain is party to three treaties that prohibit torture aswell as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: the Convention against Torture;[52]the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);[53]and the revised Arab Charter on Human Rights (the Arab Charter).[54]Bahrain’s constitution, penal code, and code of criminal procedure alsoforbid the use of torture or other conduct that violates human dignity.Conventionagainst TortureThe Convention against Torture, to which Bahrain acceded onFebruary 18, 1998, states,[T]orture means any act bywhich severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionallyinflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third personinformation or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person hascommitted or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing himor a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, whensuch pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with theconsent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in anofficial capacity.[55]Under the Convention against Torture, a state must“take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measuresto prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.”[56]Authorities must also systematically review custodial and interrogationpractices and procedures with a view to preventing torture.[57]Furthermore, the Convention against Torture requires a state party to conduct aprompt and impartial investigation “wherever there is reasonable groundto believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under itsjurisdiction.”[58]A state must also ensure that any victim of torture“obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequatecompensation....”[59]Particularly relevant to this report, statements extracted by torture shall notbe used as evidence in any proceeding “except against a person accused oftorture as evidence that the statement was made.”[60]The Convention against Torture also requires states to takemeasures to prevent acts that fall short of torture but that amount to“cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”[61]InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political RightsBahrain acceded to the ICCPR on September 20, 2006.[62]The ICCPR provides that “[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or tocruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”[63]Further, arrestees and detainees “shall be treated with humanity and withrespect for the inherent dignity of the human person.”[64]The ICCPR requires that states undertake efforts “to respect and toensure to all individuals ... the rights recognized in the present Covenant,without distinction of any kind....”[65]ArabCharter on Human RightsBahrain ratified the Arab Charter in 2006,[66]and the treaty entered into force on March 15, 2008. With regard to torture andill-treatment, the Arab Charter mirrors the ICCPR, and provides that“[n]o one shall be subjected to physical or psychological torture or tocruel, degrading, humiliating or inhuman treatment.”[67]The charter obliges states to criminalize such acts, and to guarantee legalredress, rehabilitation, and compensation for torture victims.[68]The Arab Charter further provides that “[a]ll persons deprived of theirliberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherentdignity of the human person.”[69]BahrainiLawAs required by international treaties to which it is aparty, Bahrain has implemented legislation that forbids torture.[70]More specifically, Bahrain’s constitution provides that “[n]operson shall be subjected to physical or mental torture, or inducement, orundignified treatment....”[71]Furthermore, a person accused of a crime may not be harmed physically ormentally.[72]Bahrain’spenal code criminalizes the use of “torture, force or threats, eitherpersonally or through a third party, against an accused person, witness orexpert” in order to induce a person to confess to an offense or to offerstatements or related information.[73]It also provides that civil servants (and any other persons) who engage intorture shall be subjected to a term of imprisonment.[74]The code of criminal procedure provides that anyone arrestedor detained must be treated “in such a manner as to maintain his humandignity and shall not be subjected to any bodily or psychological harm.”[75]Further, the law requires that interrogations of those detained be conducted bythe Public Prosecution Office in the presence of the accused person’slawyer.[76]As a remedy for violations of these provisions,Bahrain’s constitution provides that “[a]ny statement or confessionproved to have been made under torture, inducement, or such treatment, or thethreat thereof, shall be null and void.”[77]Bahraini law requires that suspects be presented to thePublic Prosecution Office within 48 hours of arrest.[78]When the Public Prosecution Office issues a summons or an arrest warrant, thearresting authority must present the suspect to them “immediately”or, if not feasible, within 24 hours.[79]The Public Prosecution Office must decide whether to charge the suspect with acriminal offense and, if the individual is charged, whether to continue hisdetention or order his release.[80]A person may be held for up to seven days in pretrial detention, after which acourt may authorize additional pretrial detention of up to six months.[81]The Public Prosecution Office, however, has the power to extend pretrialdetention for up to a total of 45 days for offenses found in the special sectionof the penal code pertaining to national security crimes.[82]The High Criminal Court must approve any pretrial detention exceeding 45 daysin the context of national security crimes.[83]The Public Prosecution Office is charged with investigatingand prosecuting all crimes, which would include torture.[84]The Public Prosecution Office can also demand that law enforcement agenciesinvestigate and punish breaches of duty by their officers.[85]Ministry of Interior officials told Human Rights Watch that the Ministry ofInterior’s inspector-general investigates all complaints of torture and,if warranted, refers such complaints to the Police Court within the Ministry ofInterior.[86]Civil servants, medical professionals, and other civilians are required toreport crimes to the Public Prosecution Office or other relevant authorities.[87]Under Bahraini law victims of torture can also seek redressthrough a civil action.[88]However, Decree 56/2002, discussed above, confers immunity from investigationor prosecution on government officials alleged to be responsible for torture orother serious human rights abuses committed prior to 2001.[89]These provisions, on their face, appear to violate the Convention againstTorture.IV.Allegations of Torture or Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading TreatmentBased upon its interviews and review of the documentaryrecord, Human Rights Watch has concluded that there is credible evidencedemonstrating that, since December 2007, Bahraini security forces[90]have:used electro-shock devices against detainees;suspended detainees in painful positions;beat detainees’ feet with rubber hoses and/orbatons;slapped, punched, and kicked detainees, and beaten themwith implements;forced detainees to stand for prolonged periods of time;andthreatened detainees with death and rape.The use of these techniques, separately and in combination,violates Bahrain’s obligations under international and national law, asreference to any number of authorities makes plain. For example, internationalcourts have repeatedly classified the use of electro-shock devices as tortureor cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.[91]Similarly, courts have found that suspending victims by their arms and legsconstitutes torture.[92]Further, courts have characterized the beating of feet as torture,[93]and have deemed other forms of beating to be torture or cruel, inhuman ordegrading treatment.[94]International tribunals have also concluded that standing for great lengths oftime amounts to torture or inhuman treatment.[95]In addition, threats to torture, rape and/or kill have been found to constitutetorture and/or inhuman treatment.[96]The testimonies that follow are organized by the types oftorture and abuse that were reported to Human Rights Watch. In many cases, thesame individual alleged that he was subjected to two or more types of tortureor abuse. We provide some background on each individual the first time adetailed portion of his account appears.Seventeen ofthe men also identified one or more of the officers from the CID or NSA whothey claimed participated in their torture. The officers named were MajorYusuf al-Arabi, Captain Fahd Fadalah, Captain Bassam al-Muraj, and LieutenantIsa al-Majali of the CID and First Lieutenant Badr al-Ghaith of the NSA. HumanRights Watch was able to confirm that all these men are in fact officersworking for the Ministry of the Interior or the NSA.  However, at thiswriting, in January 2010, Human Rights Watch has received no response toletters addressed to the Minister of Justice and the ministry of interiorinquiring as to whether complaints of torture or ill-treatment had been madeagainst these officers, or whether their superiors had ever questioned themabout the treatment of detainees.[97]Useof Electro-Shock DevicesEleven of the 20 former detainees Human Rights Watchinterviewed for this report said that security forces had subjected them toelectro-shock devices. From the descriptions offered, these devices likely werestun guns (shaped like an electric shaver) or—in at least oneinstance—a cattle prod (shaped like a stick).[98]When held against a nerve cluster for several seconds, a stun gun immobilizesthe victim’s body. If applied for shorter periods, a stun gun will createthe sensation of a powerful punch or kick.[99]Although when used properly stun guns leave little in the way of marks (seebelow), it is not uncommon for the application of a stun gun to leave small,short-term burns that form thin scabs before disappearing within a week or two.[100]The individuals interviewed reported that security forcesemployed electro-shock devices, by and large, during the early stages ofdetention while interrogations were ongoing.Yassin Ali Ahmad MushaimaOn December 20, 2008, YassinMushaima, an unemployed single 21-year-old, went to the NSA headquarters at the Manama Police Fort after learningthat security forces had been looking for him at his home. There, officersarrested Mushaima and interrogated him about pipes that they said he used forbomb-making.[101]Mushaima was also questioned as to whether prominent Shia oppositionleaders—specifically, Hassan Mushaima and Shaikh Muhammad Habibal-Moqdad—were funding illegal activities.[102]“I was standing with my hands cuffed in front ofme,” Mushaima said. “They said I should confess or they would hitme. I heard something that sounded like a bug zapper; they were trying tofrighten me. They put a device on my hand for a second which made meshiver.” Mushaima reported that after 10 to 15 minutes of additionalquestioning, the officers applied the device to his stomach, causing him tofall. “They kicked me until I stood up and then they started slapping myface and hitting my legs,” he said. “Maybe 30 minutes later theyput the device on my penis for just one shot. I was wearing pants, but it mademe feel lost and numb.” According to Mushaima, during an interrogationthe following day, agents took off his clothes and put the electro-shock deviceon his penis again.Mushaima told Human Rights Watch that he was later taken toDry Dock. There officers applied an electro-shock device to his genitals andother parts of his body on four or five occasions during interrogations overthe course of Mushaima’s first 15 days at the facility. Mushaima saidthat the electro-shock devices left temporary dark marks on his hands, feet,chest, and penis. At a court hearing on February 22, Mushaima said, he told thejudge that he was innocent and had been subjected to torture. According toMushaima, the judge said he did not want to hear the details.Mushaima was one of the Hujaira defendants whose purportedconfession was broadcast on Bahraini television. He claimed that an officerwith an Egyptian accent told him that if he spoke with “the shaikh”he would be freed the next day. “They took me to a villa,” Mushaimatold Human Rights Watch. “I sat down in one place but they said I shouldsit over in another place. They removed my blindfold. The shaikh was sittingacross from me. He kept asking me to speak more loudly, although others in theroom were speaking normally. The officers had told me what to say, so when heasked how I was being treated, I said, ‘Very good, OK.’ My face wasswollen, and my shirt had sleeves to cover the scars. I only learned many dayslater that this was on television.”[103]Muhammad al-HamadiMuhammad al-Hamadi is a 29-year-old single man who works asa hospital cashier. Security forces arrested him on December 16, 2008, at hishome and took him to the CID compound in Adliya. Hamadi reported that atAdliya, officers with Egyptian accents (al-Hamadi was blindfolded, but said herecognized Egyptian accents) told him that he had been arrested because he wasa bomb maker in a terrorist group. When al-Hamadi replied that he knew nothingabout bomb making, one of the officers with an Egyptian accent said,“We’ll help you remember.”“They ripped my pants andshirt, and tore off all my clothes,” al-Hamadi said. “They made melie on my side on the floor. I was handcuffed and they held my legs down. AnEgyptian was holding an electric device and he put it on my sexual parts. Heput it on and off many times.”[104]Al-Hamadi reported that the device was never placed on his body for more than asecond or two.Al-Hamadi said that, later, officers pulled his hands (stillcuffed) in front of his knees, and secured a bar behind his knees.  Theyput the ends of the bar on chairs so that al-Hamadi was suspended upside down(see Muhammad al-Singace’s detailed description of this“parrot” suspension position in the next section). While asking himabout the location of bombs, officers again applied the electro-shock device. Al-Hamadireported that he was subjected to electro-shock devices periodically during hisfirst three days in detention. After approximately a week, he said, he wasmoved to Dry Dock. There he reported that an officer with the NSA applied an electro-shockdevice to his genitals twice.Al-Hamadi was another al-Hujaira defendant whose“confession” was broadcast on television. According to al-Hamadi,an officer came to him in Dry Dock and said, “You will meet an importantperson today. He will be your link to the king. You must admit that you madebombs and that Hassan Mushaima incited you to do it. Then, the king willamnesty you.”Al-Hamadi said he was then brought to a “villa”in which he was introduced to the director of the NSA.[105]Al-Hamadi said that the director then introduced him to a “shaikh”and instructed al-Hamadi to say that he had been involved with bomb making atthe instigation of Hassan Mushaima, Shaikh Muhammad Habib al-Moqdad, andAbdul-Jalil al-Singace (all prominent opposition figures). Al-Hamadi said thathe sat on a couch with the NSA director on one side of him and the shaikh onthe other, repeating everything that the director told him to say.[106]Muhsin Ahmad al-GassabMuhsin al-Gassab, 32, works in human resources for a private company. He ismarried and has a daughter. On December 23, 2008, plainclothes security forcesarrested al-Gassab at his home at 5 a.m. and took him in an unmarked car to DryDock; he said it was only after his family visited him a month later that helearned he was being held in the Dry Dock facility. “I asked where I wasbut they would not even tell me the time,” he told Human Rights Watch.In Dry Dock, an officer who said he was from the NSAquestioned al-Gassab. “When I asked what this was about, the officerreplied, ‘You should tell me,’” al-Gassab said. He reportedthat most of the questioning concerned trips he had taken to Syria and Turkey;the officer asserted that he had received “terrorist training” inSyria. Al-Gassab said he was punched and beaten during the first interrogationsession.On one occasion, al-Gassab said, guards cuffed his handsbehind his back and removed his clothing. “They stripped me completelynaked except the blindfold,” he said. “When I resisted them takingoff my pants, they slapped me on the head until I stopped. Then I heard thesound of sparks, like when you use jumper cables to start a car.” Theguards applied an electro-shock device to al-Gassab’s genitals, hands,stomach, back, legs and feet. More specifically, the guards applied the devicefor a second before removing it and pausing for a moment. Then, they appliedthe device to another part of al-Gassab’s body for a second beforeremoving it again. On a few occasions, guards put the device on al-Gassab forseveral seconds, which caused him to fall.[107]Al-Gassab reported that this pattern was repeated for what seemed like hours(with sporadic breaks) and that he was repeatedly told to confess to havingtrained in Syria. Al-Gassab said that his tormentors told him that others hadalready confessed. “There are people stronger than you who talked,”al-Gassab said they told him. “If you don’t you’ll suffer thefate of those before you.”After this first session, according to al-Gassab, officersused the electro-shock device on his arm several times on each of threeadditional days. The device was not used following al-Gassab’s first weekof detention. Al-Gassab stated that the device left temporary black marks onhis bicep, sternum, thigh, and penis.Al-Gassab said that when officers took him to the PublicProsecution Office on his fourth day of detention, his blindfold was removed.“There I saw [myself in] a mirror for the first time,” he said.“I had a swollen eye, all red, and dried blood around my nose.” Hesaid the prosecutor asked him if he had been beaten or subjected to abuse, andthat he showed the prosecutor marks on his thigh from the electro-shock device.The prosecutor agreed to a request from al-Gassab’s lawyer for anexamination by a forensic doctor. Al-Gassab said he saw the doctor several dayslater and that the doctor took photos of the marks on his body with a mobilephone. According to al-Gassab, the doctor said that the photos would be sent tothe prosecutor, but al-Gassab does not believe that the photographs are in hisofficial file.[108]A report by a doctor with the Public Prosecution Office stated that al-Gassabhad bruises on his leg and stomach as of December 27, 2008.[109]Al-Gassab said he was held forabout 100 days, all but the last 10 days in solitary confinement.[110]Hassan Jassim Muhammad MakkiHassan Makki is a married, 29-year-old father of one who hadworked as a bus driver prior to his arrest. It was Makki’s brother, Ali,whose death on December 17, 2007, led to violent clashes between protestors andsecurity forces in Jidhafs and other Shia villages and neighborhoods. OnDecember 18, 2008, Makki went to see his lawyer after learning that securityforces had been looking for him; he was arrested before reaching hislawyer’s office. Security forces took Makki to the NSA headquarters atthe Manama Police Fort.According to Makki, officers at the Police Fort taunted himupon his arrival, saying, “Welcome to the brother of the martyr.”The officers handcuffed and blindfolded Makki before removing his clothes. Theythen applied an electro-shock device to his genitals for a second or two beforeremoving it. This process was repeated for several minutes before two officers withEgyptian accents told Makki to confess. Makki reported that over the next twodays agents applied the electro-shock device to him intermittently duringsessions that typically lasted 10 minutes, usually focusing on the genitals.The agents continually asked about the location of bombs while applying thedevice. Makki reported that after two days he was taken to Dry Dock, whereofficers applied the electro-shock device every day ortwo, generally over the course of five-minute periods with an hour’sbreak in between. The device left temporary black marks on his penis, Makkisaid.[111]Naji Ali Hassan FateelNaji Fateel is a 35-year-old, married father of three whoearns a living by performing maintenance work. Fateel was arrested on December21, 2007 at his home at 8 a.m. Officers took Fateel to Adliya, where theyforced him to stand in the CID compound’s yard until 7 p.m.Later authorities moved Fateel to an office where heencountered Isa al-Majali.[112]Al-Majali accused him of setting fire to a Special Forces jeep and stealing a weapon from the vehicle during the December 21 Jidhafs clashes.[113]Fateel denied the accusations. According to Fateel, al-Majali “startedcalm, but then got angry.” Two agents, who Fateel said had been standingbehind him, kicked him in the back of the knee and the lower back, and punchedhim. Then, he said, they used two separate devices to inflict electro-shocks onhis torso and neck; one of the devices had the shape of a stick, he said, andthe other looked like an electric shaver with two small electrodes sticking outof it.[114]Fateel reported that the agents applied the devices to him in response tosubtle signs that al-Majali made, such as moving an ashtray on his desk.[115]Later that evening, while Fateel was suspended from the ceiling (as discussedbelow), officers applied an electro-shock device to him with a particularemphasis on his genitals. Fateel lost consciousness at times during thisepisode. According to Fateel, the electro-shock device left temporary burnmarks on his body.Fateel told Human Rights Watch that officers took him to thePublic Prosecution Office around midnight on the day of his arrest. He reportedthat he met for approximately an hour with a prosecutor who questioned himabout the burning of a police jeep and the alleged theft of a weapon inJidhafs. Fateel told the prosecutor about the abuse that he had suffered. Amedical examiner in the Public Prosecution Office examined Fateel approximatelya week after he had first been detained. According to Fateel, during this10-minute examination the doctor saw burn marks from an electro-shock device,but said simply that they were minor injuries. The doctor did not comment onthe bruises and swelling that Fateel said were evident on his face at the time.[116]Muhammad Makki HamadMuhammad Hamad, a 20-year-old unemployed high-schoolgraduate from Sanabis, told Human Rights Watch that he had been active with theUnemployment and Low Income Committee. He told Human Rights Watch that he wasarrested at about 3 a.m. on December 24, 2007, and detained for approximatelyseven months. He said that during interrogation sessions in the initial periodof his detention security officials badly beat him. On the second night of hisdetention, he said, while he was suspended naked by his wrists, officerssubjected him to an electro-shock device, applying the device to his underarmsand his penis. Hamad said that one officer who appeared to be in charge, acaptain with the CID, had also been among the group of officers who arrestedhim and beat him while transporting him to the CID compound. Hamad told HumanRights Watch that the same man participated in the interrogation session,although he did not think he was present during the electro-shock torture.[117]Other detaineesFive other former detainees—Maytham al-Shaikh, IsaAbdullah Isa, Ahmad Abd al-Hadi, and two who requested they not be named—toldHuman Rights Watch that security forces subjected them to electro-shock devicesduring the initial periods of their detentions.[118]In addition, Ahmad Jaffer Muhammad reported that an officershowed him a black device that looked like an electric shaver (evidently a stungun), and threatened to use it, but ultimately did not.[119]Another individual, who did not wish to be named, also said that officers threatenedto subject him to an electro-shock device, but did not do so.[120]Documentary evidenceHuman Rights Watch reviewed several documents that appearedto corroborate allegations regarding the use of electro-shock devices. For example, a report by Ministry of Health doctors regardingMuhammad Tarif (whom Human Rights Watch was not able to interview) statesthat bruises on Tarif’s hand may have been the result of burns.[121]As discussed, stun guns can cause short-term burns that form scabs.[122]Further, public prosecutor minutes regarding the interrogation of Abd al-Redaal-Saffar note an injury to al-Saffar’s left leg, which al-Saffar toldprosecutors resulted from an electro-shock.[123]The absence of substantial documentary evidence ofelectro-shock torture is not particularly probative because, when usedcarefully, stun guns (the electro-shock device described by former detainees inalmost all instances) leave few marks and such marks typically heal quickly.[124]Indeed, torturers employ electro-shock devices in part because, while theapplications are extremely painful, their surface physical effects aredifficult if not impossible to detect afterwards.[125]Suspension in PainfulPositionsOf the 20 former detainees whom Human Rights Watch interviewed,16 reported being suspended in painful positions in one manner or another. Morespecifically, the former detainees described:being suspended by their wrists with their hands pulledover their heads;being laid on their stomachs and then suspended off theground with their ankles and wrists tied together behind their backs; and/orbeing suspended by a bar or pole affixed under the kneesand raised onto supports.[126]Several former detainees also reported that security forcescuffed their hands behind their backs, pulled their hands up, and attached thehandcuffs to the grate covering a window air conditioner.Ahmad Jaffer MuhammadAhmad Muhammad, 35, is married with two daughters. He doesadministrative work for a major international bank. He told Human Rights Watchthat Special Security Forces arrested him in the early morning hours ofDecember 28, 2007, and brought him to the CID compound in Adliya. There,Muhammad was blindfolded before being taken to a dark room where someone toldhim that he had no rights under unspecified new terrorism laws in Bahrain. Someoneelse said to Muhammad, who was working as a clerk in the Interior Ministry atthe time, “You work for us, but really you are against us.”According to Muhammad, guards took him to another room andplaced pieces of cloth around his wrists before placing handcuffs on the piecesof cloth and cuffing his hands in front of him. Muhammad said that the guardsthen lifted him and put the chain of the handcuffs over an object above hishead that he believes was a pipe. When the guards released Muhammad, he wasfully suspended in the air. Muhammad estimates that he remained suspended for 10to 15 minutes while officers hit him with what felt like a rubber hose andkicked him. “I was moving frantically because of the pain in my wristsand shoulder,” Muhammad said. “I bloodied my toes kicking themagainst the wall without shoes on. They still hurt now.” One of theguards or interrogators told Muhammad to disclose the whereabouts of “thegun.” Muhammad said that he knew nothing about a weapon.Eventually, the guards lowered Muhammad to the floor andbrought him to an office, where his blindfold was removed. A supervisoryofficer asked, “Was that enough to talk about the rifle?” WhenMuhammad said again that he knew nothing about a weapon, guards took him backto the same room and suspended him in the same way. Later that night, guardstook Muhammad to a stairwell where they cuffed his hands (with no cloth) andplaced the chain of the handcuffs over a rail above his head. Muhammad, whocould barely touch the floor, estimates that he remained in this position foran hour.Muhammad told Human Rights Watch that officers brought himto the Public Prosecution Office after midnight, approximately 24 hours followinghis arrest. There he met with Wael Boualay, a prosecutor. According toMuhammad, Boualay accused him of having stolen a rifle from a police car afterthreatening a police officer who was in the car with a machete, causing theofficer to flee. Muhammad asked how he could have threatened an armed officer, allegedlybefore he stole the gun at issue. Boualay simply repeated the accusations,Muhammad said. Muhammad told Boualay that he had been suspended off the floorand showed Boualay a bruise on his leg that he said was the result of beingkicked. Boualay had no response. After a meeting that lasted several hours,Muhammad signed a statement without reading it, feeling that he had no choicebut to sign.Muhammad told Human Rights Watchthat at the first court proceeding in the Jidhafs case, he and others relatedthe abuses they had suffered to the court.[127]Ministry of Health doctors later examined Muhammad upon the court’sdirection and found healed wounds on Muhammad’s wrist that they concludedcould have resulted from pressure applied by handcuffs.[128]Ahmad Abd al-HadiOn December 22, 2007, security forces arrested Ahmad Abdal-Hadi, then 17 years old; at the time Human Rights Watch spoke with him, Abdal-Hadi was 19 and had just finished high school. Abd al-Hadi had been indetention for approximately five days when he was taken outside at the CIDcompound (after being subjected to electro-shocks). There, he said, an officer askedhim where “the gun” was and he replied that he did not know.Someone then told Abd al-Hadi, “I advise you to confess before you hang,because people cannot bear it.” When Abd al-Hadi said that he had nothingto confess, the officer told him, “If you bring me the gun, I will takeyou to your examination [for high school] tomorrow.” Abd al-Hadi saidthat he would disclose information if he had any.Abd al-Hadi stated that the guardsthen took him inside to a stairwell. They cuffed his hands after wrappingpieces of cloth around his wrists. They made him stand on a chair, and someonereaching from above pulled his hands over his head before attaching a secondpair of cuffs to those Abd al-Hadi was already wearing. The guards thenattached the second pair to a handrail on the stairs. A guard said, “Thisis your last chance.”Someone kicked the chair away and Abd al-Hadi was suspendedin the air with his feet not touching ground. When he screamed “Get medown,” a guard hit him in the stomach, saying “Don’t yell.Tell me where the gun is.” Abd al-Hadi screamed in pain nonetheless. Aftera few minutes, he said, guards detached the cuffs from the rail and he fell tothe ground. A few moments after that, the guards suspended Abd al-Hadi again inthe same manner, this time for perhaps 10 minutes. They repeated the process athird time after which Abd al-Hadi overheard someone say, “If he hadanything to say, he would have said it.” Guards then took Abd al-Hadi toan office, where, he said, an officer remarked, “He doesn’t knowanything.” Abd al-Hadi was not subjected to any significant abusethereafter.Abd al-Hadi told Human Rights Watchthat during the Jidhafs case court proceedings in 2008 (and after approximatelythree-and-a-half months of detention), he was examined by a Dr. al-Arady and other physicians fromthe Ministry of Health. Abd al-Hadi said that he reported the abuse he hadsuffered to these doctors, including the suspension and use of electro-shockdevices. According to Abd al-Hadi, Dr. al-Arady noted the pain in Abdal-Hadi’s joints and that Abd al-Hadi had a burn that was healing.[129]Human Rights Watch reviewed areport by Dr. Ali al-Arady and two other physicians that was submitted to thecourt. The report noted that Abd al-Hadi complained of “hanging”and of being “electrocuted.” The report statedfurther that Abd al-Hadi had painful limitations to his shoulder mobility whichcould have been caused by “wrist hanging,” and a healed wound thatcould indicate he had suffered from a burn.[130]Maytham Badr Jassim al-ShaikhMaytham al-Shaikh, a 33-year-old married father of two,worked as a safety officer for a construction company until he was arrested byCID forces in his father’s home at approximately 4 a.m. on December 21,2007. Officers brought al-Shaikh to CID headquarters at Adliya upon his arrest;after four days, he was told that he was being charged with stealing an assaultrifle from a police car.Shortly after al-Shaikh’s arrival in Adliya, guardstook him to a stairwell. They placed his handcuffs on a rail above his head andlet him hang in the air for what he said felt like hours. Al-Shaikh reportedthat when he was released he had no feeling in his hands. Guards repeated thisprocess later that day.Al-Shaikh said that officers took him to the PublicProsecution Office at 4 a.m. on the fourth day of his detention (and after hehad been subjected to electro-shock devices and suspension, as discussed above,as well as beatings, as will be discussed below). There, al-Shaikh met with Ahmad Bucceri, a prosecutor. Al-Shaikhsaid he requested a lawyer, but Bucceri told him that no lawyer was availableand began questioning him about events in Jidhafs. According to al-Shaikh, whenhe said that he had not been at the protests, Bucceri told him to sign a paper,without allowing him to read it.When al-Shaikh attempted instead to describe the abuses hehad suffered, he said Bucceri responded, “Do not tell me aboutthat.” Al-Shaikh was then taken to another room where officers beat hisstomach, his back, and the back of his head with their hands and feet;according to al-Shaikh the officers seemed to take care not to hit his face. Theofficers returned al-Shaikh to Bucceri’s office. Bucceri smiled andpointed to the paper. Al-Shaikh signed the document, which he said containedfalse information, in the hope of avoiding further abuse. Al-Shaikh was made tostand near a wall in the CID compound after returning there and to his surprise—inlight of his “confession”—guards periodically hit him as theywalked by.Al-Shaikh said that an Egyptian doctor working for the PublicProsecution Office examined him approximately one month after he was arrested. Al-Shaikhtold the doctor about having been suspended. According to al-Shaikh, the doctorsaid, “Bahrainis learned about hanging from the Egyptians.” Thedoctor told al-Shaikh that he had injuries consistent with being suspended.Al-Shaikh also reported to HumanRights Watch that during the Jidhafs case proceedings, his lawyers requested anindependent medical examination, which the court ordered to be conducted.[131]Ministry of Health doctors concluded in a written report provided to the courtthat al-Shaikh had a “circular bruise around the wrists, probably causedby handcuffs around the wrists, and pressure on them during hanging.” Inaddition, X-rays found a sprain in al-Shaikh’s left shoulder joint.[132]Naji Ali Hassan FateelNaji Fateel told Human Rights Watch that after he wassubjected to an electro-shock device following his December 2007 arrest, asdiscussed above, guards blindfolded him and brought him to a room. There, theykicked and punched him until he was bleeding. “Then they handcuffed meand attached my handcuffs to a rope that was hanging down,” Fateel said. “Theypulled me off the ground so my feet were not touching.” Fateel reportedthat guards hit him with a baton and employed an electro-shock device while hewas suspended. “They kept telling me to cooperate,” Fateelelaborated. “Later they took me back to Isa al-Majali’s office andI sat down. I couldn’t stand because of the pain. Al-Majali told me tosign a paper. I said I wanted to read it, but al-Majali said, ‘No.’Eventually, I signed it during that meeting.”Fateel told Human Rights Watch that doctors from SalmaniyyaHospital examined him four months later, after he had appeared in court.[133]Human Rights Watch reviewed the report submitted to the court by Ministry ofHealth doctors from Salmaniyya Hospital, which stated that Fateel suffered fromlimited shoulder mobility and pain that “confirmed [Fateel’s]claims of being hung from the ceiling, as such symptoms are rare at that ageexcept when the patient is exposed to such an injury.” The doctors alsowrote that there were dark bruises on Fateel’s legs that could haveresulted from beatings.[134]Unnamed detaineeHuman Rights Watch interviewed several individuals who saidthat they were subjected to suspension, but who wished to remain anonymous. Onereported that two days after his December 2007 arrest, he was taken to astairwell in the CID compound (he wore a blindfold, but heard someone walkingon the stairs). There, guards wrapped cloth around his wrists before cuffinghis hands in front of him. A guard then attached the handcuffs to somethingover this individual’s head, pulling him up so that only his toes weretouching the ground. For approximately 20 minutes the individual remained inthat position while guards beat his shins and feet, and swung his body.Approximately two weeks later, he said, guards repeated the process.[135]This individual showed Human Rights Watch indentations onhis shins that he attributed to the described beatings. In addition, Ministryof Health doctors noted scars and bruises on this individual’s leg aswell as a circular scar on his wrist that the doctors concluded could have beencaused by a handcuff.[136]Isa Abdullah IsaIsa Isa is a married 27-year-old with one son. He works as acourier for a private company. Security forces arrested Isa at a roadblock onDecember 23, 2007, and took him to CID headquarters.Isa told Human Rights Watch that at one point guards tookhim to a “portacabin” where they tightly wrapped strips of blanketaround his wrists and bound his hands closely together using a third strip ofblanket; they then attached a metal handcuff to the piece of blanket bindinghis hands together. Two guards then lifted Isa so that he was standing on achair. One guard attached the open cuff to a metal bar on the stairs andanother guard kicked the chair away. They suspended Isa for a period that heestimated to be 30 minutes, during which they swung his body back and forth.After releasing him, guards made Isa run in circles and move his fingers to gethis blood circulating.[137]They then repeated the process.The next day, Isa said, he was suspended again. During thisepisode, a guard told him, “We want you to go inside and say, ‘Yes,I gave him the weapon.’” Guards then took Isa to a room where heheard the sobbing voice of a person he knew. According to Isa, an officer said,“Isa, tell me about this person.” Isa reported that he replied,“I saw him take the weapon from the car,” falsely implicating hisfriend because he simply “needed to rest” and intended to retracthis statement later.Isa told Human Rights Watch that a doctor with the Ministryof Interior examined him toward the end of December 2007. According to Isa, thedoctor must have observed a number of injuries to Isa’s face and body,but said nothing. At the end of February 2008, Isa reported, a doctor with anEgyptian accent working for the Public Prosecution Office examined him forapproximately five minutes. Isa said that this doctor must have observedvarious scars and bruises, but told Isa that he saw nothing,Isa said that doctors from Salmaniyya Hospital, includingDr. al-Arady, examined him at the court’s direction toward the end ofMarch 2008; Isa noted that three weeks passed between the court’smandating the exam and the actual exam.[138]In contrast to the findings of the doctors who had examined Isa earlier, theMinistry of Health doctors testified during the trial of the Jidhafs case thatthey had observed injuries to Isa’s person that could have been caused bythe abuse that he alleged.[139]A report written by these doctors noted that Isa had circular wounds to hisleft wrist and concluded that those wounds “could have been caused byhandcuff pressure.” The report also stated that Isa’s“shoulder pain and stiffening, and wounds around the wrist may indicatethat [he had] been hung from his wrists to the roof.”[140]At the time of his interview with Human Rights Watch, Isa had visible scars onhis wrist that he attributed to having been suspended in this manner.Ali Muhammad Habib AshoorAli Ashoor is a married 30-year-oldwho is presently unemployed. He was detained at his home on April 9, 2008, at 3a.m. Authorities at CID headquarters in Adliya interrogated Ashoor with regardto the alleged arson attack on a farm in Karzakan that belonged to the formerhead of the NSA.Eventually, Ashoor told Human Rights Watch, guards took himto a stairwell with high ceilings where they wrapped his wrists together withstrips of cloth and attached one loop of a set of handcuffs to the cloth. Theguards put Ashoor on a chair and attached the second loop of the handcuffs tosomething in the ceiling. Ashoor said that the guards kicked the chair away,leaving him suspended in the air with his feet not touching the ground. Ashoorsaid that a guard hung on him to increase the weight on his arms and wrists,and beat him with a stick in the area of his kidneys and on his toes. After asecond suspension episode, Ashoor told Human Rights Watch, he was “readyto sign anything.” He then confessed to setting the fire and to a rangeof related details that were provided to him by an officer who, he said,introduced himself as Isa al-Majali.Ashoor was taken at around midnight to the PublicProsecution Office where he met with prosecutor Ahmad Bucceri. Ashoor said thathe told Bucceri that he had been beaten and Bucceri replied, “It’sgood that they did that. Just shut up.” Ashoor asked for a lawyer andBucceri said that the hour was too late for a lawyer to come. Bucceri then readfrom a document that contained statements similar to those Ashoor had made atthe CID compound. Ashoor signed the document.[141]Said Hadi Hamid AdnanSaid Adnan, 28, was returning from work on March 27, 2008(it was his second day as a bus driver), when security forces called him andtold him to report to a local police station. There, two CID officers pulledAdnan’s shirt over his head and handcuffed him before driving him to CIDheadquarters at around 9 p.m.Adnan told Human Rights Watch that on the first day of hisdetention guards tied his hands together with cloth in the manner described byIsa and Ashoor, made him stand on a chair, and then suspended him. “Myarms were being pulled up in a way that made me feel like I was choking,”he said. “Someone saw that I was having trouble breathing and quicklysaid to get me down.”Adnan said that guards then brought him outside. Accordingto Adnan, a supervisory officer approached him and said, “Confess or youwill not be able to cope.” Adnan replied, “Tell me what to say andI will confess.” When the officer said that he wanted to know aboutAdnan’s role in the arson at the farm in Karzakan, Adnan replied,“I don’t have anything I can say.” Adnan told Human RightsWatch that the officer responded, “Take him back inside.”“They suspended me again in the same way,” Adnansaid. “I screamed and cried. I felt hopeless. I said, ‘Tell me whatyou want,’ and they took me down.” Adnan reported that thesupervisory officer came to him a few minutes later and said, “You knowwhat you have to confess about.”Adnan told Human Rights Watch that the following dayofficers brought him to see Ahmad Bucceri at the Public Prosecution Office. Adnansaid that he told Bucceri about some of the abuse that he had suffered. Bucceritold Adnan that someone had confessed to the arson and also implicated Adnan. Guardsthen brought in a man whom Adnan knew from Karzakan.  This man said thathe had telephoned Adnan to make arrangements for starting the fire, that he andAdnan had brought gas to the farm, and that they had broken a lock on a gate tofacilitate the entry of co-conspirators. When Adnan said he had never spoken tothis man on the telephone, Bucceri countered that he had a recording of theconversation. Adnan said that he replied, “Bring the recording now and Iwill confess.” In response, Bucceri said, “You call yourself a man.Go back to CID for three days and if you can withstand it, I will call you aman.”Adnan said that officers brought him back to CID and that onthe fifth day of his detention, and after being suspended repeatedly, heconfessed to starting the fire. According to Adnan, he was brought again to thePublic Prosecution Office where he signed a confession.[142]Nadr Ali Ahmad al-SalatneNadr al-Salatne, 36, works for a private interior designcompany. Security forces arrested him at his home on December 23, 2007 at 2:30a.m. While officers drove al-Salatne to CID headquarters in Adliya, one said tohim, “You should be a Sunni, not a kafir.”[143]At Adliya, an officer asked al-Salatne about the location of “thegun,” saying that others had already given statements indicating thatal-Salatne had it. When al-Salatne said he did not know anything about a gun,the officer told him, “You Shia want to change the government, butwe’re going back to the 1990s.”According to al-Salatne, guards brought him to a room. “Theymade me lie face down,” al-Salatne said. “They tied my ankles and wrists together behind my back and put a bar through myarms. They lifted me off the ground—I was screaming. They said,‘Now, you will talk,’ but I lost consciousness.” Al-Salatnesaid he awoke on the ground when someone threw water on him. He reported thatduring his first seven days of detention, all of them at CID headquarters, guardssuspended him in this manner approximately five more times. On one occasion,they suspended him by putting a bar under his knees and then lifting it up.Al-Salatne told Human Rights Watch that on the third day ofhis detention, officers took him to the Public Prosecution Office at aroundnoon where he met with a prosecutor, Ahmad Bucceri. Al-Salatne asked for alawyer, but Bucceri replied that no lawyer had come to represent al-Salatne(echoing comments attributed to Bucceri by Maytham al-Shaikh and Ali Ashoor).Bucceri told al-Salatne that he had been identified by others as one of theJidhafs demonstrators and asked al-Salatne about the Bahraini Youth Society forHuman Rights (of which al-Salatne is a member) and the Haq Movement. Al-Salatnesaid that he reported the abuse he had suffered to Bucceri, who cut him off,saying, “I’m not interested.” After approximately 21 days indetention, authorities released al-Salatne without charge; al-Salatne neverappeared in court or reported his abuse to judicial authorities.[144]Muhammad al-HamadiMuhammad al-Hamadi reported that after his December 2008arrest guards made him sit on the floor with his knees pulled into his chest. Theythen wrapped pieces of his pants around his wrists (the pants had been torn offpreviously) and pulled his hands in front of his knees, securing them withhandcuffs. A long bar was then placed under al-Hamadi’s knees. Guards puteach end of the bar on a chair, suspending al-Hamadi between the chairs.According to al-Hamadi, he remained suspended forapproximately 30 minutes while officers with Egyptian and Bahraini accentsrepeatedly asked, “Where are the bombs?” Eventually, al-Hamadisaid, he confessed falsely to keeping bombs at a laundry in his village, andthe guards brought him down. After being given some water, al-Hamadi statedthat in fact he did not have any bombs, at which point the guards suspended himagain. When the pain caused al-Hamadi to say that he would confess to where thebombs really were, someone in the room replied, “We don’t want toknow anymore.”Al-Hamadi was later held at Dry Dock. He said that there, onone occasion, guards cuffed his hands behind his back and pulled them up overhis head, attaching them to an air conditioning grate. Al-Hamadi estimates thathe remained in this position for approximately 40 minutes.[145]Muhammad Abdullah al-SingaceMuhammad al-Singace, 44, is a chemical technician with theMinistry of Works. He told Human Rights Watch that security forces arrested himat his father’s house on December 27, 2007, several nights after theincident in Jidhafs village. Al-Singace said that he was blindfolded andhandcuffed upon his arrest, and taken to CID headquarters in Adliya whereofficers questioned him about the whereabouts of the gun that had reportedlybeen taken by protestors. Al-Singace said that the police claimed to have founda box of ammunition when they later searched his house; according toal-Singace, the authorities had planted it there. For the first several nightshis captors forced him to stand, and handcuffed him in a way that made itpainful to sit.On the third night of his detention, al-Singace said,officers took him into a room where they bound his hands in front of his kneesin a sitting position and then hoisted him off the ground with a stick placedbehind his knees—he referred to it as the “parrot” position. Theofficers beat the soles of his feet with a stick for approximately half anhour. Guards then made him stand against a wall, despite his numb and swollenlegs, and several times kicked him when he slumped to the ground.The following night, he said, guards took him to an upstairsroom, laid him on his stomach, and bound his arms and legs together behind hisback, causing excruciating pain. On the fifth night, he said, he was againbrought upstairs and suspended for about 15 minutes by his arms, which werepulled up behind him. Before and after these sessions, he said, officersquestioned him about his activities and the whereabouts of the allegedlymissing gun. On the sixth night, al-Singace reported, he was brought to the PublicProsecution Office. There, he acknowledged being at the site of the Jidhafsprotest, but said that he knew nothing about the gun or any ammunition.Al-Singace told Human Rights Watch that prior to his firstcourt appearance he was kept mostly in solitary confinement. His lawyers raisedhis torture complaints at the hearings, he said, and the judge ordered that heget a forensic medical examination at Salmaniyya Hospital.[146]He received a five-year prison term that was suspended with the king’spardon of April 11, 2009. Al-Singace said he was unable to return to his jobuntil he signed a commitment to halt all involvement in political protests.[147]Muhammad Makki HamadMuhammad Hamad told Human Rights Watch that, on the secondnight of his detention at CID headquarters in Adliya in December 2007, guardstook him to a stairwell connecting the ground floor with the second floor. Theguards stripped him naked and removed a blindfold he had been wearing. Theysuspended him by a chain attached to his cuffed hands that was then attached alsoto a metal pipe or bar extended from a stair, he said. Hamad reported that hewas suspended like this for what seemed to be nearly an hour. For about 10minutes of this period, he said, an officer asked him about the whereabouts ofthe gun allegedly taken from the police car in the Jidhafs incident. Hamad saidthere were about 10 others present, wearing black masks and street clothes. Hamadsaid that in addition to subjecting him to electric shocks his captors beat himabout the trunk of his body with rubber hoses. “Then [the officer] cameback and told them to take me down,” he said.Later that night, Hamad said, he (like others) was forced tosign a piece of paper indicating that he had been at the Jidhafs demonstrationand had taken the allegedly stolen gun. Hamad said that in a subsequent meetingwith a prosecutor, he told the prosecutor of the torture, showing scars on hiswrist, but the prosecutor wrote that he saw nothing wrong. When Hamad said theconfession he had signed was false, the prosecutor tore it up. Hamad said thatseveral officers then beat and kicked him in a courtyard.[148]Ali SalmanAli Salman, a 23-year-old law student at the University of Bahrain,is an activist with the Detainees’ Committee. Salman told Human RightsWatch that authorities arrested him at his home at about 3 a.m. on February 4,2008. When he arrived at CID headquarters in Adliya, he said, guardsblindfolded him and beat him on the back of his head with their hands.Salman said he was forced to stand against a wall,blindfolded, for four days, except for periods when he was allowed to eat,pray, and use the bathroom. Salman’s interrogation began on the fifthnight. His questioners accused him of starting a fire on the property of amember of the ruling family, which he denied (this was an incident separatefrom and prior to the alleged arson attack near Karzakan in March 2008). Salmantold Human Rights Watch that around midnight Isa al-Majali said that he,al-Majali, had denied requests from other interrogators to subject Salman torough treatment. “I said, ‘No, let him speak,’” Salmanquoted al-Majali as saying, “‘But now I say take him, I need tohear his shouts.’”[149]Several officers took Salman to a room where they made himstand on a chair. They removed his handcuffs, wrapped his wrists with strips ofcloth, and bound his wrists together with another strip. They clasped one loopof a set of handcuffs to the strip binding Salman’s wrists together andattached the other loop to the ceiling, about six inches above his head. “Thenthey kicked out the chair,” Salman said. He reported that guardsinterrogated him while he was suspended for a period of between 15 and 30minutes. “Whenever I said something they wanted to hear, the chair comesback. When not, the chair goes. This happened three times. Then they kicked thechair far away.” When guards took him down, Salman said, his hands werevery swollen and one of his thumbs had turned black. He was told to flex hishands to regain circulation, and guards took him to see al-Majali. “Ijust said yes to all his questions about the attack and I signed thestatement,” Salman said.When officers took him to the Public Prosecution Office thenext night, Salman said, his hands were still swollen. There, he met with Hamadal-Buainain, a prosecutor, who, Salman claims, told him, “Say the samething [as in the written statement] or go back to the same [treatment].” Regardingthe abuse he suffered, Salman said, “I told him nothing, but he could seemy hands. Still, he wrote, ‘No signs of abuse.’ I just gave him theanswers he wanted.”Approximately a week later, Salman said, he had his firstcourt appearance and pleaded not guilty to the charge of starting the fire.When a judge asked why he had confessed, Salman described the torture he hadsuffered. On March 29, 2008, Salman was released. He told Human Rights Watchthat he did not know whether he still faced charges in connection with the case.[150]Unnamed detaineeA second former detainee who requested anonymity told HumanRights Watch that during his initial detention in late December 2008, securityofficers forced him to stand on a chair and bound his wrists with wire to theceiling. Then, the officers removed the chair and suspended this individual forabout five minutes. The pain made him cry, he said, at which point histormentors replaced the wire attached to his wrists with cloth strips andsuspended him for a longer period during which he was also beaten with a hose.He said that he told both the prosecutor who interviewed him and later thecourt about the abuse. When he raised the matter in court, he said, “Thejudge would not let us go into detail, saying, ‘We have mothershere.’”[151]Medical reports and courtdocumentsHuman Rights Watch reviewed medical reports and otherdocumentary evidence relevant to allegations of suspension, additional to thenumerous medical reports referenced above in this section. For example,Ministry of Health doctors prepared a report regarding 28 suspects in theKarzakan case in which they reported that 10 of the detainees had scarsconsistent with physical abuse and—notable with respect to allegations ofsuspension—that five individuals had scars (or bruises) on their wrists.According to the report, these injuries were caused by “handcuffing thisarea or being hung from the ceiling as most suspects testify.”[152]Human Rights Watch also reviewed court minutes reflectingthe testimony of Ministry of Health doctors in the Jidhafs case. According tothe doctors, there were rings or scars around the wrists of certain defendants,which resulted from the “tightening” of an item around the wristsand not from the normal use of handcuffs. The doctors also found that certaindefendants had limited shoulder joint mobility and irregularities of theclavicle joint. The doctors testified that it was “probable” thatthese defendants had been “suspended from the ceiling.”[153]Ministry of Health physicians wrote in a separate reportthat Muhammad Tarif (whom Human Rights Watch was not able to interview) hadcircular bruises around his wrists, indicating that he had been handcuffed in away that caused pressure such as would result from being suspended. They alsonoted that Tarif suffered from pain and stiffness in his shoulders that couldbe traced to Tarif’s having been suspended by his wrists.[154]Beatingof Soles of Feet (Falaka)Eleven of the 20 individuals interviewed by Human RightsWatch reported that security personnel had beaten their feet with rubber hosesand/or batons. The practice of beating the soles of the feet is sometimesreferred to as “falaka,” as mentioned. The soles of the feet arenot thickly muscled, and beating them causes excruciating pain.[155]Isa Abdullah IsaIsa Isa reported that after being suspended, as discussedabove, he was taken to the office of a supervisory officer. There, guards puthim face down on the ground and cuffed his hands behind his back (Isa was notblindfolded at that point). One guard put his foot on Isa’s head andanother guard put his foot on Isa’s back. Someone pulled Isa’s barefeet up at a 90 degree angle from the floor. Two guards stood at the ready withrubber hoses that were perhaps a meter in length. The supervisory officerordered the guards to beat Isa’s feet. One guard beat Isa’s rightfoot and the second guard beat his left foot. Isa screamed and his mouth wentdry “like wood.” He cried out for water. The supervisory officerdripped water from a bottle on the floor, telling Isa to have a “doggydrink.” The officers then brought Isa outside and made him run.[156]Yassin Ali Ahmad MushaimaYassin Mushaima said that at CID headquarters in Adliya onthe day of his arrest, officers forced him to lie on his stomach and lift hisfeet into the air. The officers beat Mushaima’s feet with what could havebeen a baton (it was a hard object and Mushaima was blindfolded). Afterstriking his feet approximately 10 times, the officers made Mushaima jump upand down perhaps 15 times until his blindfold fell from his face. The officersaccused Mushaima of having taken it off and slapped him.[157]Muhammad al-HamadiMuhammad al-Hamadi stated that after subjecting him to anelectro-shock device at CID headquarters in Adliya, guards put him face down onthe floor. A guard stood with one foot on al-Hamadi’s back. A secondguard pulled al-Hamadi’s feet into the air and a third guard beat themwith what seemed to be a rubber hose or a baton. Guards interspersed thistactic with the use of an electro-shock device for a period that al-Hamadiestimates to have been an hour.[158]AhmadAbd al-HadiAhmad Abd al-Hadi reported that on the day of his arrest, asupervisory CID officer showed him photographs of several people at theDecember 2007 Jidhafs protest who were wearing masks. The officer said that heknew one of them was Abd al-Hadi and if Abd al-Hadi did not confess to being atthe protest he would be taken to the “black room.” Abd al-Hadi saidthat he had not been at the protest and the officer ordered him taken toanother room.There, at the direction of the same supervisory officer,guards made the blindfolded Abd al-Hadi lie on his stomach. They bound hisankles together and tied them behind his back to handcuffs that were on hiswrists. Then Abd al-Hadi felt his feet, which were bare, being beaten while thesupervisory officer urged him to confess to having been at the protest. Afterperhaps five minutes, Abd al-Hadi could not bear the pain and yelled,“Stop, I’ll talk.” He said that while he had not gone to theprotest, he had visited the family of Ali Jassim Makki, the protestor who haddied on December 17, 2007. The supervisory officer replied, “You think Iwill accept only that?” and the beating on Abd al-Hadi’s feet beganagain. Abd al-Hadi cried out that he had seen Abd al-Hadi al-Khawaja speak atthe protest, and the beating stopped again.[159]Guards untied Abd al-Hadi’s ankles from his handcuffs, leaving him lyingcuffed on the floor.Abd al-Hadi toldHuman Rights Watch that, later the same night, he was taken to the PublicProsecution Office where he met with a prosecutor. The prosecutor asked for Abdal-Hadi’s age and Abd al-Hadi replied that he was 17. The prosecutorshowed Abd al-Hadi a document, saying, “This paper says that you were atthe Jidhafs protests.” Abd al-Hadi said he “told the police thatbecause they were beating me.” The prosecutor repeated that Abd al-Hadihad confessed and said, “If you don’t tell the truth here you willgo back to CID and then you will return to me and tell the truth.”Abd al-Hadi told Human Rights Watch that after this threatwas repeated, he said to the prosecutor that he had been at the protests. Theprosecutor then gave Abd al-Hadi a list of names and asked Abd al-Hadi whetherhe knew any of them. When Abd al-Hadi said that he only knew one, theprosecutor said, “This is your last chance or you will go back toAdliya.” After Abd al-Hadi insisted that he did not know the others,officers brought him back to CID headquarters. There, Abd al-Hadi said, he wassubjected to additional beating, electro-shock devices, and suspension (asdescribed above).[160]Hassan Jassim Muhammad MakkiHassan Makki reported that on the day of his arrest at theNSA headquarters in the Manama Police Fort, guards suspended him upside down bymeans of a bar placed underneath his knees; Makki’s hands were boundaround his shins. While Makki was in that position—with the soles of hisfeet facing up—guards hit the bottoms of his feet for approximately 30minutes while telling him to confess. Makki cried and yelled from the pain, hesaid. Makki said that while at Dry Dock guards beat his feet, typically whenthey employed electro-shock devices against him.[161]Other casesFour other individuals reported that on at least oneoccasion officers beat the soles of their feet, in some cases while they wereheld in place by other officers.[162]An additional two individuals (one of whom wished to remain anonymous) reportedthat the tops of their feet were beaten while they were suspended with theirhands over their heads.[163]Human Rights Watch did not find medical documentationconcerning injuries that necessarily resulted from the beating of feet,although one medical report did note a scar on a detainee’s foot.[164]The lack of such documentation is not particularly surprising because thistactic, as employed by careful practitioners who wish to escape detection,typically leaves no broken bones, skin lesions, or permanent marks.[165]SevereBeatingsOf the 20 people interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 18 reportedthat security forces had punched, kicked, or slapped them. Of these, allreported that guards subjected them to some degree of assault at the time ofarrest or while they were being transported to the various compounds at whichthey were detained; a few reported that there were no notable beatingsthereafter. Most individuals reported that guards beat them duringinterrogations at CID headquarters in Adliya or other facilities during theinitial periods of their detention.Muhsin Ahmad al-GassabMuhsin al-Gassab told Human Rights Watch that he wasquestioned at Dry Dock on the day of his arrest about allegedly receivingtraining in Syria. Two officers with Jordanian accents (al-Gassab wasblindfolded, but said he recognized their accents as Jordanian) ordered guardsto punch al-Gassab in the face repeatedly, causing him to bleed from the noseand mouth. A final punch to al-Gassab’s eye made him fall against a walland then to the ground. On the second day of his detention, officers toldal-Gassab to confess to receiving training in Syria while they punched him inthe back of the head and hit him in the head with a hose. Al-Gassab reportedthat guards also beat him during subsequent interrogations.[166]Muhammad al-HamadiMuhammad al-Hamadi reported that while he was held at CIDheadquarters in Adliya, guards slapped his face, his ears, and the back of hishead. After al-Hamadi was taken to Dry Dock, guards hit him in the legs with ahose on a number of occasions. On two occasions, he said, an NSA officer broughtal-Hamadi to a location in the Dry Dock yard where there were insects. Theofficer told al-Hamadi to “separate the male and female insects.”When al-Hamadi was (naturally) unable to do this, the officer punched him inthe kidney area.[167]Naji Ali Hassan FateelNaji Fateel told Human Rights Watch that he was forced tostand for hours outside in the CID compound on the day of his arrest. Officerspassing by slapped and punched him. Also on that first day, a supervisoryofficer questioned Fateel in his office about the jeep-burning and allegedtheft of an assault rifle during the Jidhafs protest. When Fateel deniedinvolvement in these events, two guards standing behind him kicked him in the backof the knees and the lower back. With open hands they hit Fateel’s earsand used fists to hit the back of his head. The officers took Fateel to anotherroom and there, when he did not agree to “cooperate,” they kickedand punched him until he fell, at which point they stepped on him.The following night, guards broughtFateel to the same office in which he had initially been questioned foradditional interrogation. When Fateel’s answers to questions about peoplehe knew were unsatisfactory, two guards standing behind Fateel (who was alsostanding) kicked him in the back, the back of his legs, and his groin (throughhis legs). Fateel said that similar although less intense episodes continuedfor the first two weeks of his detention.[168]As noted above, Ministry of Health doctors reported finding dark bruises onFateel’s legs that they concluded could have resulted from beatings.[169]Nadr Ali Ahmad al-SalatneSecurity forces kept Nadr al-Salatne in a car outside hishouse for 35 minutes following his arrest. In the car, al-Salatne said,officers slapped and punched the back of his head, his face and his body. Al-Salatnereported that a supervisory officer interrogated him several times in the firstfew days of his detention. At those meetings, if the officer did not likeal-Salatne’s answers, he looked at two guards who stood behindal-Salatne; the guards then hit al-Salatne.One night in the CID compound—after al-Salatne hadvisited the Public Prosecution Office—guards took him to a room withother detainees who had also been interrogated by prosecutors. Guards hit andkicked al-Salatne and the others, including with a baton. Al-Salatne reportedthat he fell down at certain points, which brought blows of greater intensity.Over the following few days a pattern emerged by which al-Salatne was held in aparticular office during regular working hours and then taken to another roomat 11 p.m. where officers questioned him regarding the allegedly stolen gun,street protests, and the Haq Movement. Al-Salatne stated that guards oftenpunched or slapped him during these sessions.[170]Ali Muhammad Habib AshoorAli Ashoor told Human Rights Watch that at the CID compoundofficers made him stand by a wall for approximately five hours. While he stoodthere, guards who passed by hit him.At one point during his detention, guards brought Ashoor toIsa al-Majali’s office where al-Majali said, “We have a way forhumans and a way for animals. You choose.”[171]Ashoor told al-Majali that he chose the “human way.” Al-Majaliasked Ashoor why he had set fire to the farm of the former NSA head. WhenAshoor said that he did not know anything about the incident, guards standingbehind him blindfolded him and hit the back of his head until he fell on atable. The guards then hit Ashoor with what he believes was a rubber hose onthe back of his legs.[172]Isa Abdullah IsaOn the day of his arrest, Isa Isa was put in the corner of aroom at the CID compound where guards formed a semi-circle around him, punchingand kicking him. An officer of superior rank came into the room and told theguards to stop. He said to Isa, “Now, no one can help you. I will ask youone question and if you don’t answer it this is your last day on earth. Whereis the weapon?” Isa responded, “What weapon?” The officerthen ordered the guards to continue hitting Isa. Isa said that after what heestimated to be 10 minutes, he felt as if he was going to die and confessedfalsely to hiding a weapon in a cemetery in the village of Sanabis.According to Isa, after a search for the weapon provedfruitless, someone said to him, “Do not tell me anything. We don’twant the gun. We are just going to beat you.” There were several guardsstanding by Isa, and they kicked and punched him as he begged for mercy. Laterthat day, a guard poured water in Isa’s ear. Another guard hit the earfive or six times with an open hand.[173]Ministry of Health doctors found injuries to Isa’s hand that theyconcluded were “possibly caused by beating” as well as a wound tohis ankle.[174]Muhammad Makki HamadMuhammad Hamad told Human RightsWatch that officers beat him with fists and sticks when arresting him, hittinghim in the groin and face while demanding that he “surrender theweapon.” At CID headquarters, he said, guards took him to the office of asupervisory officer. The officer questioned him for perhaps 10 minutes; eachtime Hamad denied having or knowing the whereabouts of “the gun,”someone slapped him on the head from behind. Then, Hamad said, the officer andothers took him out to a paved yard where they forced him to kneel. The officersaid to him, “Just confess to where the weapon is. Otherwise these guyswill hurt you.” Someone kicked Hamad, knocking him over. Someone else ranat him and kicked him in the jaw, causing his mouth to bleed. “They tookme to the clinic there in the headquarters and stopped the bleeding,”Hamad said, “and then took me outside again. It was very cold and I onlywas dressed in a T-shirt. I had to stand in front of a wall blindfolded from 4to 6 a.m.”[175]Medical reports and courtdocumentsHuman Rights Watch reviewed a number of documents beyondthose referenced in the Fateel and Isa cases, which recorded injuriesconsistent with allegations of general physical abuse. For example, Ministry ofHealth doctors found that Muhammad Tarif (whom we were not able to interview)had jaw injuries that could have been caused by “direct beating on thejaw.”[176]In court proceedings, these doctors reiterated that this was likely the causeof Tarif’s injury.[177]In another instance, the chief medicalexaminer of the Public Prosecution Office found that Abd al-Reda al-Saffar(whom we were not able to interview) had shoulder bruises and injuries to thebottom of his leg that had been caused by contact between an object and thoseparts of al-Saffar’s body. The chief medical examiner also noted thatal-Saffar had injuries to his body that resulted from contact with a floor, awall, and handcuffs.[178]Similarly, a medical examiner at the Public Prosecution Office concluded thatHassan Ali Fateil (whom we were not able to interview) had suffered injuries tohis head, arms, and legs that were caused by contact with some manner of roughobject.[179]Perhaps most significant among the documents that HumanRights Watch reviewed with respect to general beatings was the report byMinistry of Health doctors regarding those detained in the Karzakan case.According to this report, 12 of the 28 examined defendants had bruises orscrapes. Ten of these individuals also had scars that could not be explained bypre-detention incidents (additional individuals had scars from incidents priorto detention). While the doctors noted that too much time had passed from thetime of injury to offer definitive conclusions, they opined that the scars andbruises could have been caused by beatings. These forensic doctors noted thatone individual also had irregularities in his ribs that could have“resulted from beatings.”[180]Threatsto Rape and KillHuman Rights Watch interviewed a number of individuals whoreported that security forces threatened to kill or rape them or theirfamilies. These threats were made during the interrogation process.Threats to RapeNaji Ali Hassan Fateel reported that while being suspendedwith his hands above his head officers told him that he had to cooperate.Otherwise, one of the officers told Fateel, security forces would arrestFateel’s wife and put her with a Pakistani guard who would rape her. Theofficer said that the Pakistani’s regular “job” was to rapeboys.[181]On the day of his arrest, Yassin Ali Ahmad Mushaima wasbeing questioned regarding pipe bombs. When Mushaima said he knew nothing aboutbombs, guards removed his clothing and threatened to rape him. They also saidthat they would rape his sister and mother.[182]At CID headquarters in Adliya, an officer taunted AhmadJaffer Muhammad by saying that he was going to have sex with Muhammad.Muhammad, who was blindfolded at the time, told Human Rights Watch that thethreat terrified him.[183]Isa Abdullah Isa told Human Rights Watch that an officersaid to him, “If you don’t confess, I will bring your wife and letall the guards have her, I swear to God.” Isa heard the officer tellsomeone to “start the car” before saying to Isa that he was goingto get Isa’s wife. Isa said he then falsely confessed to giving a gun toanother individual.[184]Threats to KillYassin Ali Ahmad Mushaima reported that on the second day ofhis detention a guard put a heavy object in his hand, saying, “Feelthis.” Mushaima, who was blindfolded, realized that it was a gun. Theguard took the gun back from Mushaima, covered Mushaima’s mouth with hishand and put the gun to Mushaima’s head. Mushaima then heard the voice ofa friend who was being brought into the room. The friend said that he andMushaima had thrown Molotov cocktails together, seeming not to know thatMushaima was in the room. After the friend was taken away, the guard removedthe gun from Mushaima’s head.[185]Abdullah Muhsin Abdullah Muhsin is a 32-year-old employee ofa real estate company. He reported that on the day of his arrest, someone put acircular metal object to his head that he took to be the barrel of a gun. Anofficer then threatened to bring Muhsin’s mother and brother to Adliyaunless Muhsin revealed the location of the gun that protestors had allegedlytaken in the Jidhafs incident.[186]Forced StandingOf the 20 individuals interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 13reported that they were made to stand for extended periods of time, typicallyoutside in the courtyard of the CID compound during the night.  Somereported that guards forced them to stand for many nights in a row.Others reported that they were made to stand outside for hours when they firstarrived at the CID.Some individuals described being forced to stand as a matterof course during the day when they were held in small offices at the CIDcompound.   Others reported that this practice was employed at DryDock as well.   Those who complained of this abuse reported that, attimes, officers forced them to stand for long periods in response to theirrefusals to confess.[187]Abuseof a Sexual NatureTwo of the individuals we interviewed described episodes ofserious sexual abuse or degradation.Isa Abdullah Isa reported that while he was blindfolded in aroom at Adliya, guards tied a plastic flexible handcuff around his penis andforced him to drink a bottle of water. Every 15 to 30 minutes, the guardsforced him to drink more water and Isa began to feel a strong urge to urinate.He cried out, asking to use the toilet, but the guards refused. Isa said heconsidered urinating where he stood, but the flexicuff prevented him from doingso. Eventually, a guard removed the flexicuff, but Isa still was not permittedto use the bathroom. He urinated on himself.[188]As discussed above, Maytham Badr Jassim al-Shaikh reportedthat on the first day of his detention he was suspended by his wrists twice.During the second session, officers told al-Shaikh that they knew he had taken“the gun” and demanded to know where it was. When al-Shaikh, whowas blindfolded, said that he knew nothing about a gun, the officers removed hisclothes and pulled his legs apart. Then, al-Shaikh said, they inserted what hebelieves was a baton into his anus for a few seconds. One of the officers said,“If you want to pretend to be a real man, we’ll show you how to bea real man.”[189]V.Bahraini Government Officials’ DenialsWhile visiting Manama, Human Rights Watch met with a groupof officials at the Ministry of Interior, including deputy minister BrigadierTariq bin Zina and inspector general Brigadier Ibrahim al-Ghaith.[190]The officials denied that torture had taken place in the cases documented hereand claimed that the consistency in the accounts of abuse reflected the factthat the individuals Human Rights Watch interviewed had been imprisonedtogether and had consulted the same group of defense lawyers. In the statedopinion of these officials, the consistency of the specific allegations ofabuse was evidence that the allegations had been fabricated. The officials alsosaid that the former detainees who alleged abuse were trying to arouse politicalsympathy.When Human Rights Watch pointed outthat many of the victims said they had been kept apart from other prisoners formuch of their detentions, the officials said this was not true, and that evenin the CID headquarters the detainees were confined in groups of three or fourpersons. We note, however, that at least in the Hujaira case, the court orderedthe end of solitary confinement for the defendants more than a month after theyhad made specific allegations of abuse to the court.[191]Human Rights Watch told the officials that much of thealleged abuse occurred during interrogation and that in the Jidhafs case, forexample, interrogations seemed to focus on finding the weapon that protestorshad allegedly taken from a police vehicle. Inspector general al-Ghaith saidthat videos in the possession of the authorities allowed them to identifyexactly who took the weapon, making it unnecessary to coerce such information.[192]The officials acknowledged that abuse of detainees had beena problem in the past, referring to the period before Shaikh Hamad assumedpower in 1999, but said that the Ministry of Interior now has an appropriatesystem in place to investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment.“Abuses happen,” one official said, “but we are serious aboutprosecuting.” The officials told Human Rights Watch that inspector generalal-Ghaith—in conjunction with the Internal Affairs Department—wasresponsible for carrying out such investigations and reporting to the chief ofpolice.The officials also said that some cases of abuse bygovernment agents have gone to the Police Court, an arm of the Ministry ofInterior.[193]The officials told Human Rights Watch that between July 1, 2007, and June 12,2009, 163 investigations had been completed, 17 of which resulted inconvictions. The officials said that there had been no convictions for tortureor ill-treatment arising from complaints of detainees in the Jidhafs, Karzakanor Hujaira cases. Col. Muhammad Buhamad, assistant undersecretary for legal affairsand a former prosecutor, said he had sent his officers to the CID “tolook for the alleged instruments [of torture], but they didn’t findany.”Human Rights Watch also met with Ali Fadhul al-Buainain,head of the Public Prosecution Office, which is under the jurisdiction of theMinistry of Justice.[194]Al-Buainain told Human Rights Watch that, by law, suspects are brought to meetwith a prosecutor within 48 hours of arrest, except in counterterrorism cases.He said that in meetings with prosecutors, suspects are accompanied by counsel.He also said that a prosecutor will ask a suspect whether he has sufferedbeatings or any coercion, and look for signs of abuse. If the suspect complainsof abuse, according to al-Buainain, the prosecutor continues the interview, butthen refers the case to “our forensic doctors.” Some who complainof abuse nevertheless confess, al-Buainain said, but such confessions, by law,have to be ignored and the prosecutor must rely on other evidence to prove thecase in court. Some defendants, he said, only raise allegations of abuse whenthey get to court.Al-Buainain confirmed that torture complaints are referredback to the Ministry of Interior, which conducts an investigation and dealswith the accused officer in the Police Court. He said that, as far as he couldrecall, he had not referred any such cases to the Ministry of Interior sinceDecember 2007, when the first of the incidents documented in this reportoccurred. Bahraini law gives the Ministry of Interior the responsibility forinvestigating allegations of torture and ill-treatment by security officials,al-Buainain said, and his office follows up with the Ministry of Interior.Like the officials with whom Human Rights Watch met at theMinistry of Interior, al-Buainain said that the consistency of the allegationsof abuse by detainees was a reason why, for him, they “do not ringtrue.” He acknowledged that there may have been some “individualmistakes,” but not the kind of systematic abuse that had been alleged.VI.Credibility of Witness AccountsHuman Rights Watch found the above-described accounts oftorture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment credible for a number ofreasons.Consistency of AccountsThe consistency of the accounts provided to Human RightsWatch lends them significant credibility. More specifically, those interviewedoffered consistent descriptions of a finite set of techniques rather thandiverse lists of abusive tactics. As discussed, the individuals we interviewedspoke about being subjected to electro-shock devices, suspension, beatings ofthe feet, beatings generally, and grave threats to bodily integrity. While manyof the former detainees we interviewed reported being subjected to several ofthese methods, very few said that they had been subjected to all of them.Moreover, there was a high degree of consistency andspecificity with respect to the testimony we heard as to how these techniqueswere employed. For example, the former detainees who alleged that they had beentortured with electro-shock devices stated that the devices were generallyapplied for only an instant. The former detainees also offered similardescriptions of the electro-shock devices themselves and the small temporarymarks that the devices caused—a result typical of such implements. Further,the few victims who reported being subjected to electro-shock devices forlonger than a second stated that they fell down following such applications.These accounts are consistent with the fact that, as discussed, stun guns willincapacitate an individual if applied for three to four seconds—not adesirable result during an interrogation—while shorter applications causesevere localized pain.Many of those who reported being suspended said that theseepisodes occurred in a stairwell. Many of these individuals stated that stripsof cloth were used to tie their hands together or that blankets were placed ontheir wrists underneath handcuffs, evidently to prevent visible injuries frombeing sustained. Additional examples of consistent and detailed testimonyregarding various tactics can be found throughout this report.We recognize, of course, that the individuals interviewed byHuman Rights Watch could have colluded to offer false (and similar) accounts ofabuse—as Bahraini officials contend—or influenced eachother’s accounts by discussing together their time in custody.However, the former detainees had reported specific detailsregarding their abuse during their initial interviews with defense counsel at atime when they said they were being held in isolation.[195]Moreover, the reports of abuse given to defense counsel matched those given toHuman Rights Watch. For example, Muhsin Ahmad al-Gassab reported to his lawyersthat he had been subjected to electric shocks, including on his penis, and usedterms to describe his beatings that were quite similar to the terms he usedwith us. Yassin Ali Ahmad Mushaima reported to his lawyers that he had beensubjected to electro-shock devices and beaten with a baton, fists, and feet. Neitherreported to his defense counsel that he had been suspended and neither madesuch a report to us.[196]The detainees also reported the use of illegal interrogationtechniques to the court while still being held in solitary confinement. Forexample, in a February 23, 2009 court session, the defendants in the Hujairacase testified that they had been subjected to electro-shock devices, beatings,and threats.[197]As noted, it was more than a month later that the court ordered thesedefendants to be removed from solitary confinement.[198]Beyond counsel meetings and court sessions, the detainees also complained aboutabuses similar to those they reported to us while being interrogated byprosecutors and examined by doctors, as official documents establish. Finally,it is significant that the former detainees Human Rights Watch interviewed wereinvolved in three distinct cases and said that they did not know many of theother former detainees.Further bolstering the general credibility of those weinterviewed is the fact that the former detainees described in consistent termsvarious deceptive interrogation techniques that were not necessarily abusive. Forexample, many individuals stated that officers showed them photographs ofdemonstrations and asserted that they were identifiable in the photographsregardless of whether they bore any resemblance to those pictured. In manyinstances, officers told those being interrogated that their friends hadimplicated them in allegedly criminal activity. In other instances, securityforces brought detainees together and made one (usually blindfolded) implicateanother in a particular crime without knowing that the implicated person waspresent. There would be little reason to coordinate testimony regardingnon-abusive techniques as part of a conspiracy to fabricate stories of torture.As such, the former detainees’ accounts of these techniques areinstructive with respect to their reliability in general.In addition, the individualsHuman Rights Watch interviewed offered consistent testimony regarding lessdramatic aspects of their detentions that were not necessarily related tointerrogation. For example, nearly all those interviewed stated that securityforces pulled their shirts over their heads while they were being driven togovernment compounds after arrest. Nearly all described having their headspushed down in the cars that took them to security compounds upon arrest so asto keep them out of sight. It is unlikely that these smaller details would bethe subject of a conspiratorial agreement because they are not crucial in andof themselves.Finally, Human Rights Watch conducted intensive separateinterviews with 20 individuals that typically lasted several hours. No materialinconsistencies emerged; rather, the descriptions of abuse that we heard weremarked by substantial similarities as to the techniques employed and the mannerin which those techniques were employed.Declining to Exaggerateor Embellish TestimonyNo detainee interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated thatabuse continued unabated throughout his entire period of detention. Rather, theformer detainees typically said that they were subjected to abusive tactics forparticular periods of time, which ranged from a few days or weeks (mostcommonly) to a month or more (more unusually). They most frequently reportedthat abuses occurred during periods of active interrogation rather than as acondition of detention generally. Furthermore, those interviewed did not takeadvantage of leading questions—intentionally asked—to assert thatthey had been subjected to abusive techniques beyond those they described orfor periods longer than they specified.An example of this dynamic was the interview of AbdullahMuhsin Abdullah Muhsin.According to Muhsin—who is quite overweight—guards took him to astairwell in the CID compound where they made him stand on a chair and tied hiswrists together with fabric. One end of a rope was then attached to the fabricand the other end was attached to the stairwell. After a guard kicked away thechair on which Muhsin stood, the rope snapped under the pressure ofMuhsin’s weight, and Muhsin fell a short distance to the ground, unhurt.Guards attempted this maneuver a second time with the same result, at whichpoint, according to Muhsin, someone said, “That’s enough.” Inresponse to repeated questions, Muhsin reported that he was not subjected toany further abuse during his eight months’ detention; eventually thecourt acquitted Muhsin.[199]Muhsin’s testimony could hardly be characterized as embellished. Rather,it is credible and also bolsters the accounts of others who described beingsuspended in a stairwell in a similar fashion.Likewise, Ahmad Jaffer Muhammad reported that a supervisoryofficer threatened to apply a black electrical device that looked like anelectric shaver to him if he did not confess. According to Muhammad, theofficer did not turn the device on or ultimately apply it to him.[200]Similarly, another former detainee, who requested not to be identified, toldHuman Rights Watch that during an interrogation session he heard the sound ofan electric device being turned on. He said that after he told the guards hesuffered from a chronic health condition, he was not subjected to the device orother abuse.[201]Someone who wished to mislead an investigator regarding the use ofelectro-shock devices would not offer an account that omits any mention of theuse of such devices. As such, these testimonies are credible and corroboratethose of other individuals regarding the presence (and type) of electro-shockdevices at various security compounds.Moreover, those interviewed by Human Rights Watch candidlyadmitted when certain information was beyond their knowledge. For example,these individuals stated that they did not know who had utilized certaintechniques against them when, for example, they had been blindfolded or simply hadnot known the identity of a perpetrator. In other instances, the formerdetainees openly said that they could not estimate the length of time duringwhich certain techniques were employed or the locations in which suchtechniques were used. That an individual declines to fabricate testimony undersuch circumstances enhances his credibility.Documentary Evidence, includingMedical ReportsUltimately, the documentary evidence Human Rights Watchreviewed, that is, reports generated by government doctors, prosecutors and thesecurity services as well as court papers, provided the strongest corroborationof the former detainees’ accounts. Government doctors—primarilyfrom the Ministry of Health—reported in many cases that the detaineesthey examined bore injuries that could have been caused by the abusivetechniques described here. In most instances, the doctors stated that theycould not conclusively determine the causes of the relevant injuries becausethose injuries had been sustained months earlier. Nonetheless, the fact thatgovernment doctors concluded that numerous detainees suffered from injuriesthat could have been caused by the practices of which the detainees complainedis quite significant.[202]For example, Ministry of Health doctors testified in courtregarding the results of their examinations of defendants in the Jidhafs case.The doctors had found “rings” or scars around the wrists of certaindefendants, which they believed resulted from the tightening of an item aroundthe wrists (not handcuffs used in the normal course of detention or restraint).The doctors also found irregularities in the shoulders and clavicle joints ofcertain defendants. According to the doctors, it was “probable”that these defendants had been “suspended from the ceiling.” Thedoctors, when asked how they explained the “pains, burns and scars in thesame places over all the suspects’ bodies,” testified that thecause could be “their exposure to hanging, beating, torture orhandcuffs.”[203]Ministry of Health doctors also prepared a report regarding28 suspects in the Karzakan case. The doctors found that 17 of these suspectshad scars, bruises, or both. Moreover, five of the suspects had scars orbruises on their wrists that, according to the doctors, were caused by“handcuffing this area or being hung from the ceiling as most suspectstestify.” The doctors further concluded that the other scars and bruisescould have “resulted from beating.”[204]Most significantly, in October 2009, the court in aproceeding that was part of the Karzakan case dismissed all charges against alldefendants, in part based upon the doctors’ report. More specifically,the prosecution had argued that 18 of the 19 defendants confessed to attackinga police car (thereby leading to the death of an officer). Notably, CaptainFahd Fadalah of the CID, one of the officers named by a number of the detaineesHuman Rights Watch interviewed, testified that these defendants had confessed.The court, however, wrote that it saw “the statementsof the defendants and their confessions at the prosecution office [as being]taken by semi-coercion” in that the defendants “said they werephysically coerced and intimidated during criminal investigations ... if theydidn’t confess....” Further, the court stated that it “foundit to be true that the medical committee ... found that [the defendants] havebruises on their wrists which the defendants said are because of hanging fromthe ceiling, beside that the report of the committee found the presence ofbruises and traces of wounds....” Because the court “[was] notcomfortable with the confessions attributed to the defendants, and [had] doubtsthat the confessions were voluntary and by their choosing,” the courtelected to “annul all confessions.”[205]Beyond the reports regarding groups of defendants discussedin this section, Bahraini government doctors also issued reports regarding manyindividual detainees which found that those detainees had injuries consistentwith their accounts of abuse, as discussed above.Human Rights Watch also interviewed attorneys who had beencounsel to certain of the defendants in the Jidhafs case, the Hujaira case,and/or the Karzakan case. These counsel reported observing various signs ofphysical abuse on their clients such as bruises and cuts during their initialattorney-client meetings.[206]While not documentary evidence, these reports were telling as well.In sum, doctors employed by the Bahraini government foundnumerous detainees to have injuries consistent with the detainees’allegations of abuse. These findings constitute highly significant—andsomewhat unusual—corroboration of the accounts that the former detaineesprovided to Human Rights Watch. Indeed, given the prevalence of the injuriesreported by the doctors—for example, 17 of 28 defendants in the Karzakancase were found to have bruises or scars—it would be difficult to reachany conclusion other than that the detainees had been subjected to abuses ofthe sort reported.[207]In fact, this is precisely the conclusion reached by a Bahraini court in theKarzakan case.VII. Detailed RecommendationsTo the Government ofBahrainInvestigate promptly and impartially all allegations oftorture or ill-treatment by security or law enforcement officials of anyrank, and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law, in a court thatmeets international fair trial standards, any official found responsiblefor ordering, carrying out, or acquiescing in torture or ill-treatment.Immediately suspend any security or law enforcementofficial when credible evidence exists showing that such official ordered,carried out, or acquiesced in acts of torture or ill-treatment.Appoint a special independent public prosecutor toinvestigate allegations of torture or ill-treatment in detention bysecurity or law enforcement officials as documented in this report,including in the Ministry of Interior’s General Directorate ofCriminal Investigation (CID), and the National Security Agency (NSA). Suchinvestigations should include an investigation into the allegedresponsibility of Major Yusuf al-Arabi, Captain Fahd Fadalah, CaptainBassam al-Muraj, Lieutenant Isa al-Majali, and First Lieutenant Badral-Ghaith for acts of torture or ill-treatment. The special prosecutorshould be empowered to report his findings publicly and to bring criminalcharges, if warranted, against any officials identified as responsible forordering, carrying out, or acquiescing in acts of torture or ill-treatment.This independent investigation should also determine theextent to which public prosecutors failed to respond properly to detaineecomplaints of torture or ill-treatment, or when detainees with visibleinjuries were brought to their offices, and recommend appropriatesanctions or criminal charges.Issue and publicize widely a directive from the king,Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, stating unequivocally that the governmentwill not tolerate acts of torture or ill-treatment by security and lawenforcement officials, will investigate allegations of torture orill-treatment promptly and thoroughly, and will criminally prosecuteofficials suspected of such acts.Ensure that allegations of torture or ill-treatment by CIDor other Ministry of Interior officials are thoroughly investigated and,if warranted, prosecuted before an independent civilian court, and ensurethat victims of torture or ill-treatment receive appropriate compensationfrom the government and those officials responsible in accordance withBahraini law.Ensure that allegations of torture or ill-treatment by NSAofficials are thoroughly investigated and, if warranted, prosecuted beforean independent civilian court, and amend Decree 14/2002 to ensure thatvictims of torture or ill-treatment are able to file civil or criminalcomplaints against the NSA or any of its forces and receive appropriatecompensation from the government and those officials responsible inaccordance with Bahraini law prohibiting torture.Establish an independent civilian authority to receivecomplaints of torture or ill-treatment by security or law enforcementofficials, to monitor investigations and prosecutions in response tocomplaints, and to make public the numbers and types of complaints, andthe results of any investigations and prosecutions.Ensure that administrative and judicial proceedingsregarding alleged acts of torture or ill-treatment are subject to publicscrutiny.Enact legislation, consistent with Bahrain’sobligations as a state party to the United Nations Convention againstTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment(Convention against Torture), clarifying that Decree 56/2002, providing ageneral amnesty for offenses committed prior to 2001, does not preclude theinvestigation or prosecution of persons alleged to have committed tortureor ill-treatment and does not eliminate the opportunity for redress or anenforceable right to fair and adequate compensation by victims of tortureor ill-treatment.Amend the penal code by adopting a definition of tortureconsistent with article 1 of the Convention against Torture in order toensure that all acts of torture are criminal offenses under the law andthat penalties reflect the grave nature of such offenses.Invite the UN special rapporteur on torture and othercruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to visit and report onconditions in Bahrain.Ratify without delay the Optional Protocol to theConvention against Torture to allow independent international experts toconduct regular visits to places of detention in Bahrain.Allow nongovernmental human rights organizations,including medical professionals, access to all places of detention.To the Members of theLeague of Arab StatesCall upon Bahrain to respect and comply with article 8 ofthe Arab Charter on Human Rights, which prohibits subjecting any person totorture or cruel, degrading, humiliating or inhuman treatment. To the Governments ofthe United States, France, and the United KingdomUrge Bahrain to enact and comply with the recommendationsof this report. Bearing in mind their own legal obligations with respectto the absolute prohibition of torture, make clear that close relationswith Bahrain, including the provision of training to Bahraini securityforces, will depend on the Bahraini government’s taking measurablesteps to stop torture in places of detention and to end impunity for thoseofficials who order, carry out, or acquiesce in such acts. To the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human RightsRequest an invitation from the government to visit Bahrainto discuss allegations of torture and other issues of concern. To the Member States ofthe United Nations Human Rights CouncilQuestion the government of Bahrain on reported cases oftorture or ill-treatment in light of the government’s statementduring its Universal Periodic Review in April 2008 that there are no casesof torture in the country.AcknowledgmentsJoshua Colangelo-Bryan, a consultant with Human Rights Watchand senior attorney in the New York office of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, researchedand wrote this report, with assistance from Joe Stork, deputy director of HumanRights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa Division.

As you are aware from ourmeeting in June, Human Rights Watch has been investigating allegations oftorture and other serious abuse by individuals held in official custody onsecurity-related charges in the period between December 2007 and April 2009. Atthe conclusion of our meeting it was suggested that I should address furtherinquiries and concerns to you.As I mentioned at the time we met, my colleague and I spokewith numerous individuals who had been among those detained in connection withthe Jidhafs clashes of December 2007 (the Jidhafs case), the fire allegedly seton the property of Shaikh Abd al-Aziz Attiyatallah Al Khalifa near the villageof Karzakhan in April 2008 (the Karzakhan case), and the group, detained inDecember 2008 on charges that they had received arms and explosives training inthe Syrian town of al-Hujaira (the al-Hujaira case).We also met with government officials, including yourself, in order toobtain the views of the government on this matter. In addition, we revieweddocuments, including Ministry of Health reports and court papers, pertaining tothe question of alleged abuse in detention.As a result of our inquiry, we feel we have credibleallegations, in some cases supported by documentary evidence, that Bahrainisecurity forces employed a variety of techniques against detainees during theperiod under consideration that amount to torture or cruel, inhuman ordegrading treatment. These abusive techniques include the use of electro-shockweapons and devices, suspending detainees in painful positions, beating thesoles of detainees’ feet, severe beatings generally, forced standing, andin several cases, threats of rape or other grave physical harm. We thinkyou would agree that these are techniques that, when used separately or incombination, constitute torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, asdefined by the UN Convention Against Torture.These abuses, according to the persons we interviewed, tookplace for the most part in the compound of the General Directorate of CriminalInvestigation (CID) in Adlia, and at the Short-Term Detention Center (whichdetainees referred to as Dry Dock because of its close proximity to the ArabShipbuilding and Repair Yard, or ASRY). We understand that both of these sitesare run by the Ministry of Interior.We are aware of the court opinion handed down recently, onOctober 14, in which the court dismissed all charges against 19 defendants whowere being tried on charges in connection with an alleged attack on a securityforces vehicle in the Karzakhan area in April 2008, and the death of a memberof the security forces. While the court raised a number of reasons for itsdecision, a key one was the conclusion that defendants’ confessions mayhave been coerced, and that the prosecution had produced insufficient evidenceto convict other than the tainted confessions.The court’s conclusion rested in part on the findingsof Ministry of Health doctors contained in a September 2008 report producedpursuant to a court request. In this report, the doctors noted that of 28examined defendants, 10 had scars consistent with physical abuse, includingfive who had scars on their wrists. According to the report, these scars werecaused by “handcuffing this area or being hung from the ceiling as mostsuspects testify.” Moreover, the Ministry of Health doctors found that 12of the defendants had bruises that could have been caused by beatings.Ministry of Health doctors also testified in the Jidhafscase. According to court minutes, the doctors testified that there were ringsor scars around the wrists of some defendants which were apparently caused bythe tightening of an item around the wrists (and not from the normal use ofhandcuffs). The doctors also found that certain defendants had limited shoulderjoint mobility and irregularities of the clavicle joint. The doctors testifiedthat it was “probable” that these defendants had been“suspended from the ceiling.” Further, when asked how theyexplained the “pains, burns and scars in the same places over all thesuspects’ bodies,” the doctors testified that the cause could havebeen the suspects’ “exposure to hanging, beating, torture orhandcuffs.”In addition, Human Rights Watch has reviewed separatereports by Bahraini government doctors regarding individual defendants in thereferenced cases, which found that those defendants suffered from a range ofinjuries consistent with the abuse alleged by the defendants.The use of torture and ill-treatment in order to secureconfessions, or for any other purpose, would clearly violate Bahrain'sobligations under international human rights law as well as Bahrain’sConstitution and national laws. Under international law, it is theresponsibility of the authorities to conduct impartial and thorough investigations,and to hold accountable those found responsible for ordering or carrying outsuch abuse, or failing to stop it.We will, of course, reflect the view that you and otherofficers expressed when we met, namely, that allegations of torture are false,and that the Ministry of Interior has a system in place to detect and punishsuch offences if and when they are committed.Before publishing our findings, we solicit your comments onrelated matters. In particular, we ask that you respond to the followinginquiries:When we met, you stated that complaints of torture or abusecoming to your attention are investigated internally, under your authority asinspector-general, and that if warranted the person(s) alleged to beresponsible would be referred to the Police Court, within the Ministry ofInterior, for adjudication and possible disciplinary action. Should weunderstand this to mean that the Public Prosecutor refers back to the Ministryof Interior any credible allegations of torture or abuse by Ministry ofInterior officials, or on Ministry of Interior premises, and that no judicialauthority outside of the Ministry of Interior would necessarily investigate oradjudicate the allegations?Is the Ministry of Interior also responsible forinvestigating complaints of torture or abuse made against members of theNational Security Apparatus?When we met, you stated that between July 1, 2007 and June12, 2009, your office had completed 163 investigations, which resulted in 17convictions. Could you please tell us how many of those investigations andconvictions, if any, concerned findings of torture or abuse?Could you indicate how many (if any) officers with the CIDor other forces under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior facedcriminal prosecution in Bahrain’s criminal justice system, as distinctfrom the Police Court within the Ministry, and, if so, for what offenses?According to my notes, Col. Muhammad Buhamad stated duringour meeting that there have been no criminal investigations or convictions inconnection with the complaints made by defendants in the Jidhafs, Karzakhan,and al-Hujaira cases. Could you please confirm if this remains the case?Has the Ministry of Interior conducted any manner ofinvestigation regarding complaints of torture or abuse made by defendants inthe Jidhafs, Karzakhan and Al-Hujaira cases? If not, please explain why no suchinvestigation has occurred. If any investigation has occurred with respect tothese cases, please describe the specific investigative measures taken and thefindings of such investigation.Has the Ministry of Interior reviewed the medical reportsand court minutes referenced above regarding the injuries suffered bydefendants in the Jidhafs, Karzakhan and al-Hujaira cases? If not, please explainthe reason(s) why no such review has occurred.If the Ministry of Interior has reviewed the medical reportsand court minutes referenced above regarding the injuries suffered bydefendants in the Jidhafs, Karzakhan and al-Hujaira cases, please state whetherthe Ministry of Interior believes that these documents support the credibilityof detainee allegations of illegal treatment. Please also indicate the basisfor the Ministry of Interior’s position as to whether or not thesedocuments constitute credible allegations of illegal treatment. Please describethe actions, if any, that the Ministry of Interior has taken in response to anyreview of these documents that it has undertaken.When we met, you and your colleagues said that theconsistency in the specific allegations of torture and abuse by the defendantsin the Jidhafs, Karzakhan and al-Hujaira cases indicated that these defendantshad together, and with their lawyers, fabricated their accounts. Is it theMinistry of Interior’s position that all of the defendants in these threecases were detained together, and shared the same legal counsel, and thereforehad the opportunity to construct similar allegations? Is it the Ministry ofInterior’s position that the defense lawyers in these cases conspiredwith the defendants with respect to the fabrication of testimony?During our meeting you stated that the Ministry of Interiorhad a video of the Jidhafs events enabling authorities to identify theindividual who allegedly took a weapon from a police vehicle during thoseevents (you also played that video for me). Was this video introduced intoevidence during the trial of the defendants in the Jidhafs case? What is theidentity of the individual allegedly shown on the video to be taking the policeweapon?When suspects are arrested by the forces of the NationalSecurity Apparatus, are they brought to the CID compound in Adlia forquestioning?Once a suspect is brought before the Public Prosecutor, isit common for that person to be brought to the CID compound in Adliathereafter? What determines whether a person is taken to the CID compound aftervisiting the Public Prosecutor or is referred to another place of detention,such as the Short-Term Detention Center (Dry Dock)?Could you please inform us regarding the composition andresponsibilities of the Police Court within the Ministry of Interior? Does ithave the authority to conduct independent investigations? Is the Police Courtempowered to impose custodial sentences, in addition to disciplinary measures?Are the rulings of the Police Court subject to review or appeal?If your office were to uncover evidence that Ministry ofInterior officials were responsible for ordering, condoning, or carrying outtorture or abuse, would such a case be handled by the Police Court only orwould it also be referred to the Public Prosecutor and the criminal justicesystem? We look forward to your responses to these questions and any otherinformation you believe relevant. We would appreciate it very much if we couldhave your response by November 12, 2009 in order that we may reflect thegovernment’s views in our report.

As you are aware from ourbrief meeting in June, Human Rights Watch has been investigating allegations oftorture and other serious abuse by individuals held in official custody onsecurity-related charges in the period between December 2007 and April 2009.As I mentioned at the time we met, my colleague and I spokewith numerous individuals who had been among those detained in connection withthe Jidhafs clashes of December 2007 (the Jidhafs case), the fire allegedly seton the property of Shaikh Abd al-Aziz Attiyatallah Al Khalifa, near the villageof Karzakhan in April 2008 (the Karzakhan case), and the group detained inDecember 2008 on charges that they had received arms and explosives training inthe Syrian town of al-Hujaira (the al-Hujaira case).We also met with government officials in addition toyourself, including Attorney General Ali Fadhul al-Buainain, in order to obtainthe views of the government on this matter.

In response to complaints from al-Wifaq, the largestopposition bloc in the National Assembly, which represents mainly Shiaconstituents, the government conducted an investigation that reportedly clearedofficials of negligence or manipulation of the data. Al-Wifaq dismissed thereport as a whitewash. See “Bahrain Shia MPs walk out over populationrow,” Reuters, May 14, 2008. See also Hassan M.

Documenting such findings would have beeninconceivable before 1999, when Shaikh Hamad took power.[203]Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs, Courts’Administration, Case No. 7/2008/797, May 11, 2008.[204]Ministry of Health, Report toMinister of Health from Committee Assigned to Examine Suspects Upon Court Order(First Supreme Criminal Court), September 1, 2008.[205]Ministryof Justice and Islamic Affairs, Courts’ Administration, Case No.7/2008/03252, Verdict, October 13, 2009.[206]HumanRights Watch interviews with Jalila Sayed and Hafudh Ali Mohammed, June 11,2009.[207]Giventhe prevalence and nature of the injuries reported, it would be far-fetched tocontend that it was simply by chance that the detainees suffered from theseailments. Further, there would be no basis to assert that the reported injuriesoccurred prior to detention because the government doctors distinguishedbetween pre- and post-custody injuries.
