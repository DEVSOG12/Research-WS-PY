Fifty-nine men are on trial for leading an armed uprising on October 13, 2005 in Kabardino-Balkaria, in Russia's unstable Northern Caucasus region. At least 12 of them have alleged that they were tortured and then forced to sign self-incriminating statements. Medical documentation indicates that more than half were beaten.On February 5 the judge presiding over their trial, which is still in the preliminary phase, will rule on whether these testimonies may be admitted as evidence.The uprising reportedly resulted in more than 140 deaths, including 35 law enforcement officers, 15 civilians, and at least 92 of those involved in the uprising. The 59 defendants were charged with terrorism and other crimes, including hostage-taking, murder, and blackmail.Many of the defendants told their lawyers they were tortured until they signed alleged confessions.Human Rights Watch reviewed forensic examination reports for all 59 defendants. The examinations were conducted by authorities and document severe injuries that many of the defendants sustained during and after their arrest. Injuries included concussions and severe bruising, in some cases, covering their entire bodies. In most cases the causes of the injuries are noted as "blows caused by a blunt hard object at close range." The reports strongly indicate that the majority of the defendants were brutally beaten. One examination called for the detainee to be referred for an expert examination due to life-threatening injuries.Some of the defendants have complained about the torture to the prosecutor's office and asked for the alleged confessions to be excluded from the case. The prosecutor's office conducted inquiries, but despite the forensic medical evidence, has taken at face value law enforcement officials' claims that they acted within the framework of the law. To date, it has refused to open a criminal investigation.Russia is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Under all three treaties Russia has obligations to prohibit all forms of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, to punish those who resort to such actions, and to ensure that no evidence obtained in violation of the prohibition can be used in courts.Below are photos of four of the defendants and summaries of their forensic medical examinations:Rasul Kudaev  "R.
