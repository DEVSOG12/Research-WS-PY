Letter to the Russian prosecutor general's officeMap of RussiaClick to expand Image2007 John EmersonSummaryThe people now being released from the US detention facility in GuantanamoBayhave already been deprived of theirfreedom without due process. In sending them back to their home countries, the USgovernment has evidently concludedthat they have not, after all, committed any crimesagainst the United States,or that they possess no useful information about terrorism,or that there is insufficient evidence to prove their criminalintent. Or perhaps, just that keeping them at Guantanamo is more trouble than they areworth.For seven citizens of Russia,being released from GuantanamoBay in 2004 was far fromthe end of their troubles. Despite promises to the USgovernment to treat the men humanely upon their return, the Russian authorities have variouslyharassed, detained, mistreated, and beaten the former Guantanamo detainees since theyreturned.At this writing, two of them have been tortured and are in prison after investigations and trials that did not meet international fair trial standards; one has been tortured and is in prison awaiting trial;the other four are either abroad or in hiding.Taken together, their storiesamount to a powerful indictment of the inept and abusive practices of the Russian criminaljustice system.But their storiesamount to something more: they also expose the harmful consequences of transferring terroristsuspects to countries where they areat risk of torture.Previous Human Rights Watch reports, as well as the work ofmany other human rights andinternational organizations, have extensively documented the cruelty of Russiancriminal justice.Torture and the denial of the right to a fair trialare endemic in Russian police investigations and trials,and in many ways the treatment of the seven former Guantanamo detainees doesnot differ significantly from that of many other Russian Muslims who are caughtup in the wide dragnet of Russia's counterterrorism campaign-or indeed, the treatment of anyoneunlucky enough to be suspected of a crimein Russia. The experience of theseseven men should be viewed in light of Russia's problematic conduct of theso-called "war on terror," and its highly abusive criminaljustice system. But as seven men marked by the "stamp of Guantanamo" (in the words of one of them),they have endured a particularly harrowing odyssey at the hands of Russian lawenforcement.This report uses the Russian example to reveal the hollownature of the "diplomatic assurances" that the USgovernment is seeking as it transfers Guantanamodetainees back to their countries oforigin, many of which have welldocumented records of torture.Under theUnited Nations (UN) Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman orDegrading Treatment or Punishment,as well as domestic law, the UnitedStates is prohibited from returning peopleto countries where there aresubstantial grounds for believing they would face a danger of torture.So the US government-like a growing numberof others-is asking governments for "diplomatic assurances" that they will nottorture or mistreat terroristsuspects upon return.Such an assurance was sought and obtained from the Russiangovernment in 2004, before the seven detainees were flown home.Both the US and Russian governments declinedto release any substantive information to Human Rights Watch about their 2004agreement to return the seven detainees.Each government issued only the sketchiest of statements on March 1, 2004, the day thedetainees landed at Moscow'sSheremetyevo international airport. What agreements the two governments reallymade remains opaque.But one fact remains blindingly clear and is extensivelydocumented in this report: Russian law enforcement agents hounded and abusedthese seven hapless men almost continuously after their return from Guantanamo, ending finallyin the arrest or flight of almost all of them.Some endured mistreatment in detention that amounted to torture.Whatever promises of fair treatment were madeby the Russian authorities, theyclearly have been broken.The USgovernment has triply wronged thesemen: first by detaining them without due process, second by returning them to Russiain violation of international law, and third by failing to follow and protesttheir mistreatment by Russian authoritiesafter their return. In this last aspect, the Russian government of course bearsthe greatest and most immediateresponsibility. But by branding these seven men "terroristsuspects," the USgovernment certainly rendered them more vulnerable targets for Russian abuse.In this sad post-Guantanamo tale, both the US and Russian governments have agreat deal to answer for.Recommendationsto the US governmentHaltimmediately the use ofdiplomatic assurances against torture for the transfer of any person in UScustody who is at risk of suchabuse upon return, and urge other governments to do the same.Ensurethat any decision to transfer is made in full compliance with the US'sdomestic and international obligation not to return any person to a placewhere there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would beat risk of being subjected totorture.Ensure that any person subject to transfer from GuantanamoBay to his home or a third countryhas an effective opportunity to challenge his transfer before an impartialbody, including the reliabilityof any diplomatic assurances, based on fear of torture upon return.Refrain from urging other governments todetain and prosecute Guantanamodetainees unless there is adequate public evidence to support a prima facie case that the detainees areresponsible for criminal acts.Protestpublicly and at the diplomatic level the mistreatment of former GuantanamoBay detainees when evidence of suchabuse is revealed.Urgethe Russian government and the governments of all nationals returned fromGuantanamo Bay to permit visits to their countriesin the form of universal access andconfidential visits to all detainees, includingformer Guantanamo inmates by independent, internationally reputable nongovernmental or humanitarianorganizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross; and UNspecial mechanisms (such as thespecial rapporteur on torture).Recommendations to the Russian governmentStopthe persecution of former Guantanamodetainees and promptly restore to them all national identity papers andinternal passports; international passports should also be granted unlessreasonable grounds exist to deny them and opportunities are made availableto challenge those denials.Halt immediatelythe use of diplomatic assurances against torture for the transfer (whetherto or from Russia)of any person who is at risk ofsuch abuse upon return.Fullyand fairly investigate the claims of torture and ill-treatment of RasulKudaev, Timur Ishmuratov, and Ravil Gumarov, and hold accountable anyonefound responsible for it; make the results of the investigations publiclyavailable.Allowindividual complaints of torture to be heard by oversight bodiesestablished under international treaties. This would entail declaring under Article 22 of the Convention againstTorture that the Committee against Torture could receive individualcomplaints against Russia,as well as acceding to the 1976 Optional Protocol to the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.Permitinternational monitoring of alldetainees in Russiaunder conditions of confidentiality and universal access, including visits with former Guantanamo detainees, by:oissuinga standing invitation to all UN special mechanisms,in particular the special rapporteur on torture, ensuring unfetteredaccess in full conformity with that mandate's long-established terms ofreference.oaccedingto the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which provides forvisits by international and national groups to monitor detainee treatment; andopermittingaccess by international humanitarianorganizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross; permittingaccess by reputable independent nongovernmentalorganizations, both national and international.MethodologyThis report draws on Human Rights Watch interviews withthree of the former detaineesone in person, although he declined to give a fullinterview, and two by telephone. In some citations the time and place of HumanRights Watch's interview have been withheld to protect the interviewee. Inaddition, Human Rights Watch spoke with several of the detainees' family members, lawyers, and human rightsactivists, and examined official court papers, taped testimony to other human rights organizations, photographs, and media accounts, to document the human rights abuses suffered by these seven men after theygot back to Russia.[1]One of the former detainees, Airat Vakhitov,agreed to speak with Human Rights Watch, he said, because he felt the story ofthe Russian detainees' experiencesback home had not yet been told.[2]BackgroundAll seven Russian inmates who were returned to Russia-RustamAkhmiarov, Ravil Gumarov, TimurIshmuratov, Shamil Khazhiev, Rasul Kudaev, Ruslan Odizhev, and Airat Vakhitov[3]-wereoriginally detained by US forces inAfghanistan or Pakistan.Although it is difficult to generalize aboutseven men of different ages from different regions of Russia, they shared some commontraits.All of them are not of Russianethnicity, and come from ethnic minoritiesin Russiathat have traditionally been Muslim.Ingeneral they did not come from privilegedor well-to-do families, though at least two of them had received highereducation and spoke several languages, such as Arabic.[4]Although they embraced different levels of piety, at least some ofthem claim they went to Afghanistan as areligious undertaking, either to learn more about Islamic government under theTaliban or to study Islam.[5]Several said they fell prisoner to General Dostum, the Uzbek warlord in thenorth who had long battled the Taliban, and were survivors of a prison massacre at Qala-e Jangi, a fortresscontrolled by Dostum, in late 2001.All of them came into UScustody, one way or another, not long after the USinvasion of Afghanistan,and were transferred through detention facilities in Afghanistan before ending up at GuantanamoBay on variousdates during 2002.In statements to theBritish human rightsorganization Reprieve, which ishelping to prepare lawsuits against US officials for torture and ill-treatmentsuffered by detainees at Guantanamo, six of the seven detainees described their treatment at US bases in Kunduz, Bagram,and especially Kandahar and Guantanamo Bay.[6]The statements all reflected that mistreatment by US forces in Afghanistan, and especially at Kandahar, was especiallysevere: beatings; deliberately inflicting seriouspain upon the wounded (by deliberately letting stretchers drop, forexample); forcing detainees to kneel on smallrocks for hours with their hands behind their heads;exposing detainees to the elements,especially cold; denying medical treatment, especially for the wounded; jumpingand landing with the knees on the backs of detainees' heads; depriving detainees of sleep; forcing detainees to runwhile shackled in painful positions; threatening detainees with dogs;desecrating the Koran and interferingwith daily prayers; and at least initially, failing to honor the dietary restrictions of Muslims. Some said bright lights were shone on their faces throughoutthe night; others described crudeand degrading attempts at sexual humiliation.All the detainees interviewed by Reprieveuniformly described the transport toGuantanamo as particularly painful: the flight lasted more than 24 hours, during which time each detainee was tightly shackledat the ankles and wrists and notallowed to move, not even to rest his body against a neighbor. The detaineeswore masks through which it was difficult to breathe, as well as goggles andearmuffs that clamped painfully on the sides of the head.No bathroom breaks were allowed.At GuantanamoBay the detaineesreceived different kinds of treatment. None of the six who spoke to Reprieve said they were beaten. But all complained ofintense psychological pressure, includinglong periods in solitaryconfinement, sexual humiliation inflicted by female staff, sleep deprivation, and the spraying of a pepper gas that insome cases may have caused long-term damage to the eyes. Many complained ofbeing put in a freezing cold room for several hours, sometimes after beingallowed to "shower" but given no towel to dry off, apparently to worsen theexperience of cold.All of them were given injections withoutinformation about what the syringescontained, and some said they felt seriouslyill afterward.Several complained ofextreme disorientation and despairin not knowing when or if they would ever be released.[7]Despite this litany of mistreatment, when he was asked tocompare his treatment at the hands of the Americansand at the hands of the Russians after his return, Ravil Gumarov told HumanRights Watch, "In the final analysis, the Russians were worse."[8]The detainees' experience in Russiais the focus of this report.US Refoulement to Russia: A Violation of the Prohibition againstTortureThe prohibition against torture is absolute. War, nationalemergency, the imminent threat of terroristattack-none may be invoked to justify torture.[9]Many international declarations and treaties[10]have repeated this prohibition, which findsits fullest articulation in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment.The same absolute prohibition applies to sending people backto countries where they will be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.The Convention against Torture forbids the"refoulement" of a person to countries"where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in dangerof being subjected to torture."[11]The US government reaffirmed that principle in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, which states in Section 1242, "Itshall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwiseeffect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there aresubstantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of beingsubjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present inthe United States."[12]Although the Bush administrationhas recently attempted (unsuccessfully) to redefine torture, it has notdirectly challenged this principleof nonrefoulement for torture. Instead, the US government has attempted toevade this important legal obligation by obtaining "diplomatic assurances" ofhumane treatment from governments with a record of torture.[13]Diplomatic AssurancesParticularly since the attacks of September11, 2001 in the United States, the US and other governments have increasinglysought to return alleged terroristsuspects to countries where theyface a risk of torture by obtainingfrom their governments "diplomatic assurances" that the suspects will betreated humanely back home.Diplomatic assurances take a varietyof forms. Some are simply oral promises. Others are writtendocuments, in some cases signed by officials of both governments. The contentof the assurances also varies, andassurances against torture are sometimes packaged with other promises, such asa commitment to a fair trial. Someassurances do no more than reiterate that the receiving government will respectits domestic law or its obligations under international human rights law.Governments that have transferred or triedto transfer suspects with such "assurances" includeAustria,Canada, Georgia, Germany,the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden,Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The receiving countries have includedChina, Egypt, Jordan,Morocco, Russia, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Yemen, all of which have welldocumented records of torture. The USgovernment has been particularly eager to use such "assurances" as it begins torepatriate detainees from GuantanamoBay.Human Rights Watch opposes the use of "diplomatic assurances"in returning suspects to countrieswhere they are at risk of torture.Governments that engage in torture routinely deny it and refuse to investigateallegations of torture.A governmentthat is already violating its international obligation not to torture cannot betrusted to abide by a further "assurance" that it will not torture.This report provides evidence of preciselythat fact, in the case of Russia.The bankrupt nature of "diplomatic assurances" has receivedlittle attention in part because none of the governments involved want to admitto it.The receiving countries deny that they practicetorture and do not want to concede further that they broke a bilateral promiseof humane treatment.The sending countries, meanwhile, have no incentive to admit that thepromises of humane treatment they received accomplished nothing and that theytherefore violated their obligations under international law.In response to a query from Human Rights Watch, the USgovernment said in an email: "[T]he U.S. government has made clear on numerousoccasions that it reviews humane treatment concerns relating to transfers outof Guantanamo and will not transfer an individual to a country where thatindividual is more likely than not to be tortured. Where necessary inorder to address humane treatment concerns, the U.S. seeks assurances from thereceiving government. This framework applied with respect to the transferof the seven Russian nationals." [14]Some sending governments have negotiated agreements to monitorthe treatment of the suspects after they have been returned to their home countries.HumanRights Watch has documented elsewhere that such monitoringagreements have not ensured humane treatment.[15]Moreover, by its very nature, torture is practiced in secret,often using techniques that defy easy detection (for example, mock drowning,sexual assault, and psychological abuse).In some countries medicalpersonnel in detention facilities monitor the abuse to ensure that the tortureis not easily detected.And detaineessubjected to torture are often afraid to complain to anyone for fear of reprisals against them or their family members.[16]Lack of confidentiality makes it virtually impossible tomonitor an isolated detainee. If observershave access to all detainees in a facility, and are able to speak withdetainees privately, a detainee canreport an incident of abuse to them without fear that he or she will beidentified by the authorities, andsubject to reprisals. Suchconfidentiality cannot be provided when only one detainee or a small group isbeing monitored.In the case of Russia,the US government appears tohave made no attempt to either monitor or protest the inhumane treatment of theseven ex-Guantanamo detainees in Russia,despite the fact that it was aware of Russia's pattern of abusivetreatment.USofficials told Human Rights Watch in July 2006 that they were not making anyeffort to monitor the treatment of former Guantanamodetainees in Russia.[17]Simply monitoringa detainee's treatment after he returns home will not guarantee that he willnot be tortured. But that does not mean the USgovernment should simply ignore the fate of the detainees it has rendered to Russia.Such has been its policy until now.To protest the treatment of the detainees in Russia would certainly open the USgovernment to charges of hypocrisy.But the US failure to investigate andprotest their ill-treatment means that the Russian government has so far feltno pressure, no spotlight, no brake of any kind on its abuse of the sevenex-Guantanamo detainees. Although the US should never have returned the detainees to Russiain the first place, it ought to reverse course and seize the opportunity toprotest their ill-treatment now.The Risk of Torture and Ill-Treatment in RussiaAt the time these Russian citizens were sent back from Guantanamo, the USgovernment was clearly aware that evidence of the riskof torture in Russiawas abundant. The US State Department's own human rightsreport for 2003, the most recent volume at the time of their refoulement, saidabout Russia, "There were credible reports that law enforcement personnelfrequently engaged in torture, violence, and other brutal or humiliatingtreatment and often did so with impunity."[18]In June 2002, the United Nations Committee against Torture, the bodyresponsible for monitoring stateparty compliance with the Convention against Torture, had voiced its strongconcern at the "[n]umerous and consistent allegations of widespread torture andother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentof detainees committed by [Russia's] law enforcement personnel, commonly with aview to obtaining confessions."[19]The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited Russiain December 2001 and published itsreport about the continuing problem of torture on June 30, 2003, citing a "disturbing number ofallegations of physical ill-treatment" by police.[20]In addition to governmental and intergovernmental sources ofinformation about torture in Russia,international human rights groupshave also written extensively aboutthe widespread torture and mistreatment of criminalsuspects in police custody in Russia.[21]As Human Rights Watch reported in 1999, torture and ill-treatment of detaineesgenerally occurs at the time of and immediatelyafter arrest, often through police beatings, near-asphyxiations, and theapplication of electroshock in the pursuit of confessions or testimony incriminating others. Aside from a very fewhigh-profile cases in which officershave been punished for suchmistreatment, the Russian police carry out torture with almost completeimpunity. Provincial and federal prosecutors close their eyes to evidence ofabuse. The courts commonly accept forced confessions at face value, and usethem as a basis for convictions.Despite overwhelming evidence that torture has become an integral part ofpolice practice, the Russiangovernment and law enforcement agencies generally-with some notableexceptions-deny that torture or ill-treatment is a problem, and are not takingany measures to end these abusive practices.[22]Russiaextensively used torture against Muslim detainees, especially Chechens accusedof "terrorism," before September 11. But the advent of the international "waron terror" appears to have hardened the Russian government's treatment of suchsuspects. The Russian human rightsorganization Memorial stated inFebruary 2006, "We haveextensive evidence to suggest that under the pretext of fighting 'Islamicextremism' and 'international terrorism,'a large-scale campaign of persecution of Muslim followers of so-called'unconventional' Islamic sects has been launched in Russia."[23]Memorial estimates that torture wasused in more than 40 percent of the cases involving Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamist organization with an internationalpresence that has been banned in Russia.[24]Given the massive evidence about torture in Russia, it is virtually impossible to imaginethat US officials were not cognizant of the riskthat the Guantanamodetainees would be tortured, or that they did not understand the extent of the risk.Two of the Russian detainees told Human Rights Watch that USinterrogators at GuantanamoBay were clearly awarethat they would face torture and mistreatment back home.Indeed, interrogators used the threat ofreturn as a pressure tactic in interrogations: "The Americansfrightened us with return to Russia, [and] said that in Russia, we will be tortured,"[25]Airat Vakhitov told Human RightsWatch. "There was constant blackmail," Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch."They kept saying, 'We'll send you to Russia,' that 'They'll string you up there' and that kind of thing."[26]Rasul Kudaev told interviewers from Reprieve, the Britishhuman rights organization,They said, "If you don't tell us the truth, we'll send youto Afghanistan,and if after Afghanistananything is left of you, you will besent to Russiawhere you will be tortured, you will have no fingers left."[27]Certainly the detainees themselves knew what probably awaitedthem if they were sent home. Most of them had had some dealings with Russianlaw enforcement before they went to Afghanistan,and a few of them had been seriouslymistreated.According to the mother ofRuslan Odizhev, for example, her son went to Afghanistan in part because he hadbeen extensively tortured by Russian FSB (securityservice) officersin 2000 and did not think he could continue to live in Russia without danger to hisphysical well-being.[28]Airat Vakhitovsaid he was beaten in 1999 while in detention for two months on suspicion ofparticipating in illegal armed formations in Chechnya (he was nevercharged).After that experience he decided to leave the country."I knew my life wouldn't work out in Russia,"he told Human Rights Watch.[29]The detainees themselves say they repeatedly asked USofficials and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Crossat GuantanamoBaynot to be returned to Russia."We all asked not to be returned to Russia because we were afraid oftorture," Airat Vakhitov told HumanRights Watch.[30]Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch, "Wewere asking to be sent to a third country, we didn't want to go to Russia.We said it to the Red Cross too, that we wanted to go to a third country, anyIslamic country. And we were saying it to the Americans,that we weren't about to go back to Russia." According to thedetainees, both the USofficials and the Red Cross said they could not influence the decision. "Theysaid, 'That's all being decided at higher levels, we don't knowanything.'The Red Cross said, 'Wecan't do anything.' Their hands were tied."[31]Shamil Khazhiev told Human Rights Watch, "All of us asked the Red Cross overand over again not to be sent back to Russia. I didn't bother asking theAmericans because it seemeduseless."[32]Alexandra Zernova, a human rights activist working with Reprieve, interviewed six of the seven detainees[33]in early October 2005.She affirmed thatall of them had told her they had not wanted to be sent back to Russia,and had told US officials so.[34]According to the detainees, representatives of the Russiangovernment who visited the detainees at Guantanamotold them they would certainly be sent back to Russia.Airat Vakhitovsaid a senior investigator for the ProcuracyGeneral, Yuri Tkachev, visited himat Guantanamo and said, "We're going to returnyou to Russiaanyway. It's going to be much worse for you there. We're going to show you."[35]In contrast, however, Ravil Gumarov claimedthat Tkachev told him he'd be better off in Russia,saying, "In Americayou'll be in [prison] for life, in Russiawe'll give you a few years."[36]Vakhitov toldHuman Rights Watch that he continued trying to avoid being sent back to Russiaright up until the last minute:I asked the Red Cross for the last time just before ourreturn to the homeland. I asked, "Are there any alternatives?" and they saidno, and it would be better if we didn't say that we didn't want to go [On February 28, 2004, the daythe detainees were repatriated] Irefused to go to the airport, and they [the Americans]brought in a stretcher to take me out.But when I saw the stretcher, I agreed to go on my own.[37]Return to RussiaOn March1, 2004, just after the detainees landed in Russia, the US State Departmentreleased a brief statement, whichread in part,The United Stateshas transferred seven Russian nationals detained at Guantanamo to the control of the Governmentof Russia to face criminal chargesrelating to their terroristactivities during an armed conflict.The transfer is the result of discussions between our two governments over thepast year, including assurances thatthe individuals will be detained, investigated and prosecuted, as appropriate, under Russian law and will be treatedhumanely in accordance with Russian law and obligations.[38]Asked whether he had heard that the US government received adiplomatic assurance that he would not be mistreated after he returned toRussia, Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch, "I didn't exactly know [aboutthe assurance]; I understood the opposite, that they gave a guarantee to put usaway in Russia."[39]Also on March 1, the ProcuracyGeneral of the RussianFederation released a similarly terse statement, which read in part,Charges have been brought against seven citizens of Russia detained at a USmilitary base in Guantanamoand turned over to the Russian side All these people were recruited byrepresentatives of radical Islamic organizations and later sent over to Afghanistan,where they fought on the side of the Taliban.[40]After their return to Russiathe seven detainees were transferred to a jail in Pyatigorsk, in southern Russia, andcharged with participation in a criminalconspiracy (article 210.2 of the criminal code) and unlawful crossing of the nationalfrontier (article 322.2).However, theywere released on June 22,2004, because of lack of evidence.According to the Russian daily Kommersant,Russian prosecutors had no proof that the seven men had actually participatedin the fighting in Afghanistan.[41]Vakhitov told Human Rights Watchthat during nearly four months inthe detention facility in Pyatigorsk, he was visited only once by aninvestigator, who appeared to be making little effort to build a case againsthim.Instead, the investigator told himthat "we have obligations [to the Americans]to keep you."[42]Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch thatRussian officials made it clear that the detainees were in Pyatigorsk only tosatisfy the Americans, and that theMinistry of Foreign Affairs wasintent on releasing them to defy the United States: "They said, 'We're lettingyou out to spite the Americans.'"[43]While (as has been noted above) the actual substance ofagreements between the USand Russian governments, written orunwritten, could not be ascertained,Human Rights Watch's research has confirmed that the Russian authorities indeed mistreated the ex-Guantanamodetainees.Post-Return Abuses by RussiaRussian government abuses of the ex-Guantanamo detaineesfell into three main categories:torture; harassment; and denial of the rightto a fair trial.Detainees, detainees' relatives, lawyers, andother individuals with whom Human Rights Watch spoke reported that lawenforcement officers left a clear impression of intending to "get" ("ustroit") the detainees or "hang" ("povesit") a crimeon them.Over the course of severalrun-ins with law enforcement, Airat Vakhitovsaid, "I was told many times that after my time in Guantanamo, it wasn't necessary to prove Iwas a terrorist. That any one of uscould be thrown in jail because we were terrorists."[44]The two law enforcement agencies describedas most abusive by those whom Human Rights Watch interviewed were the FederalSecurity Service,or "FSB" in Russian; and the Organized CrimeDepartment of the Ministry of theInterior, a police unit known by itsRussian acronym "UBOP."[45]Some detainees also complained of abuse byinvestigators from the procuracy,who were responsible for building criminalcases.Often local and regional FSB andUBOP conducted interrogations together.Sometimes the men who beat or detained them did not wear any identifyinginsignia.In addition to being seriousviolations of human rights for whichthe Russian government is primarily responsible, incidents of torture are alsoevidence that the USgovernment violated the Convention against Torture by returning the sevendetainees to Russia.The fact that all the ex-detainees were frequently harassed by law enforcement,and two of them were denied a fair trial,is part of the general pattern of abuse they suffered. But the harassment andunfair trials also clearly had theobjective of returning the ex-detainees to state custody. These measurestherefore put the ex-detainees at greater riskof torture as well.Torture and Ill-TreatmentThe mistreatment of the former Guantanamo detainees began from the momentthey touched down on Russian soil.AiratVakhitov told Human Rights Watch,When we [first] got to Russia they didn't torture us, theyjust dealt with us very roughly, they beat us when we touched down atSheremetyevo ... at the airport, they dragged us down the runway by our feetthrough the snow and kicked us. When they brought us on the plane [for theonward journey to Pyatigorsk] they kicked us again. They asked who among us waswounded, and whoever said they were wounded got kicked on their wounds.[46]Ravil Gumarov did not rememberspecific abuse, but told Human Rights Watch he thought officials were trying toact tough by treating the seven men like terrorists,putting masks on them, tying their hands, and laying them down on the floor ofthe airplane.[47]Vakhitov toldHuman Rights Watch that he was only once formally interrogated in prison in Pyatigorsk: he was asked to provide achronology of his activities in Afghanistan.Although he was never tortured, on oneoccasion while he was praying he was told to get up onto his knees and pray notto Allah but to Jesus Christ.When he refused, he was rolled over and hisclothes were burned with the ends of cigarettes.[48]Other detainees told lawyer Alexandra Zernovathat the facility in Pyatigorsk was "very quiet" compared to what they hadendured in Guantanamo-andwhat some of them endured afterwards.[49]Rasul KudaevRasul Kudaev presents the strongest case of mistreatment inRussian detention because eyewitness testimony, photographic evidence, andofficial medical documents exist to prove it.Kudaev returned from Guantanamoin poor health. According to his mother, he suffered from hepatitis, stomachulcers, the after-effects of a bullet he received in the hip in Afghanistanthat was never removed, seriousheadaches, high blood pressure, and other ailments.These medical problems rendered him unable towork and to walk without a crutch and a profound limp.[50]On October13, 2005, several groups of armed men attacked government buildingsin Nalchik, the republican capital ofKabardino-Balkaria in southern Russia.Kudaev lived in the villageof Khasania on the outskirts of Nalchik with his motherand brother.Approximately 150 peopledied in the attacks, including atleast 94 people reported to have been attackers, 35 policemen, and 12civilians.[51]His mother claims that Kudaev was home on the day of the attack, as he wasevery day, due to his health. Ten days later, on October 23, as part of a sweepof dozens of arrests in connection with the attack, a group of agents picked upKudaev at his home.According to his mother, Fatimat Tekaeva, who was home withhim at the time of the arrest, about two dozen men dressed in camouflage andmasks arrived in armored vehicles,cars, and trucks, armed with automatic weapons and sniper rifles, and swarmed onto the property.They beat Kudaev as they handcuffed him andhustled him across the yard.[52]In a statement she wrote on December 28, 2005, in connection with an appeal to theEuropean Court of Human Rights, Tekaeva said she screamed to her neighbors tocome and witness the fact that her son was walking on his own, because she wasafraid that he would be beaten in custody until he was no longer capable ofwalking.In response, she said, an officer of the local UBOP, R. Kiarov, said, "We're not going to beat him here, all will start atthe UBOP."[53]Several pieces of evidence make it clear that, indeed,Kudaev was very seriously beaten inthe days immediately after hisarrest.On October 24 lawyer IrinaKomissarova gained access to Kudaev at the UBOP, also known as the "SixthDepartment." She described thescene:Upon arrival atthe Sixth Department I saw Kudaev R.V., who was sitting on a stool, in acontorted position, holding his stomach. There were a large bruise and manyscratches on the right side of hisface near the eye.Apart from theinvestigator, there were many other persons in the office(three to five people). Investigator Artemenko A., who had worked with him thatday, gave me the record of the interrogation of suspect Kudaev R.V. toread.After reading the document, Iasked Kudaev R.V. whether he had indeed given the testimony.In response, he expressed the wish to talk tome aloneIn our conversation, Kudaev R.V. told me that he had beentortured and beaten after he was brought to the Sixth Department.The testimony in the interrogation record wasnot his, it had been made up, and it was not correct...When Kudaev R.V. informed the investigator that he wouldnot sign the interrogation record all hell broke loose!!!From all sides people in the office gathered around (by the way, none introducedthemselves) and everyone started issuing threats at Kudaev R.V.In the end, he could no longer stand it andsaid that he would sign the interrogation record because he was afraid thatafter I left they would beat himagain.Someone in the room told me "youare free to go, we don't need your servicesany more."The fear expressed by Kudaev R.V. that he would againbe beaten I saw as realistic.[54]On October 25 Kudaev was taken before a Nalchik City Courtjudge, who authorized his continueddetention on suspicion of terrorism,participation in an illegal armed formation, attempt on the life of a lawenforcement official, and murder.[55]After the hearinghe was transferred to a pretrialdetention facility, or SIZO, where he was evidently beaten again.[56]Komissarova gained access to him the following day:They almost carriedhim in because he could not walk without outside help.In my conversation with him, he told me thathe had been subjected to physical violence.That is, he was beaten when he was delivered to the building of the UBOPon 23 October 2005,and he was also brutally beaten at the time of his arrivalat the SIZO on 25 October2005.He was beaten in thearea of the lower back and on the heels.One could see that he could not straighten out because of the pain, theleg that he could not stand on twitched, there were bruises on his face.[57]Komissarova describedother details of Kudaev's wounds to a local journalist:When I came to the pre-trialdetention centre to talk to Rasul, two men carriedhim to me because he couldn't walk. Rasul couldn't hold up his head. On the right side of his face there was a large haematoma,his eye was full of blood, his head was a strange shape and size, his right leg was broken and he had open wounds on hishands.[58]On October 27 Komissarova lodged a formal request for aforensic medical examination of Kudaev. Later, Kudaev told Komissarova that hewas beaten again on the following day, October 28.[59]On November 9,despite her objections, Komissarova was interrogated as a witness in herclient's case. The following day an investigator issued a decision removingKomissarova as Kudaev's lawyer because she had given witness testimony.[60]Kudaev was also denied necessary medicines, which may havecontributed to his suffering. Despite daily pleadings from his mother, onlyeight days after his arrest did officials on duty at the detention facilityaccept packages of medicine that his mother said he required on a daily basis.[61]In November 2005photographs of several people detained after the October 13 events, including Rasul Kudaev, began circulating on theinternet. They were all headshots showing the subjects covered with bruises,sores, and swelling. All of them except the photograph of Kudaev showed the prisoner's number at the bottom of the image, makingit clear that they had come from official investigations.[62]The photograph of Rasul Kudaev resemblesthe others in quality and in the background visible behind the detainees'heads. Although it is not possible to officially authenticate its provenance,the preponderance of other evidence of mistreatment of Kudaev suggests that itis genuine.-2005 RFE/RLClick to expand Image2006 RFE/RLPhotographs of Rasul Kudaev, before and afterhe was detained, circulated widely on the internet.Although the photographs were not widely published in localor national newspapers, which are generally controlled by the authorities, they circulated quickly in cyberspace and contributedto local uproar about the way the detainees were being treated.The uproar led the presidentof Kabardino-Balkaria, ArsenKanokov, and the special envoy of the Russian presidentto the Northern Caucasus, DmitriKozak, to visit in early Decemberthe detention facility in Nalchikwhere Kudaev and others were being held.The two officials were reportedly angry at what they saw and heard andordered the facility opened to journalists. Ultimately, the facility was openon December 8, 2005, but only toRussian a state-run television crew.Rasul Kudaev was able to speak to the camera.In a letter to his mother, he briefly describedhis meeting with Kozak and Kanokov, and said that when he told the two menabout his mistreatment, "the veins on [Kanokov's] neck swelled up with fury. Heleft here very angry."[63]However, it appears that neither man tookaction against the perpetrators of the abuse of Kudaev or any other of thedetainees.In addition to the statement by his former lawyer and thephotographs, medical documents also attest to the mistreatment of Kudaev indetention. The families of detainees who are beaten and tortured often have difficultiesobtaining such medical documents because the authoritiesare, for obvious reasons, reluctant to allow independent medical examiners intoRussian detention facilities.Some medical records that are believed to document Kudaev'scondition have not yet been released to his family and lawyers. But onehas:a note from the ambulance service station in Nalchik, dated November 1,2005, and signed by the head doctor, Kh.Kh. Sheribov. It states that an ambulance was called at23:20 on October 23, 2005, to attend to Kudaev. The note doesnot specify who called the ambulance or where the ambulance went, although bythat hour Kudaev was already in the custody of the UBOP. The note states thatKudaev was diagnosed that night as having "psycho-motor excitement,hypertension in the arteries, andnumerous bruises."[64]The local procuracyrefused to accept a petition filed by Kudaev's lawyer to open a criminal investigation of Kudaev's mistreatment, andon July 6, 2006,Nalchik City Court upheld the procuracy'sdecision.But in a decision that surprised Kudaev's family and local human rights organizations, on August 25, 2006, the Supreme Court ofKabardino-Balkaria overruled thecity court and ordered it to reconsider its ruling.[65]The case is now pending again before NalchikCity Court.Rasul Kudaev has submitted documents to the European Courtof Human Rights claiming that he wastortured.Timur IshmuratovTimur Ishmuratov also experiencedbeatings at the hands of the FSB and the UBOP.He remembered that justbefore the detainees were released from Pyatigorsk, a high-ranking FSB officialmet with all of them and told them that "the Russian government has nocomplaints against you." According to Ishmuratov, "[The official said that] ifyou live according to the law, then you won't have any harassment. He cited theRussian leadership. I believed him."[66]Ishmuratov was wrong.In the early morning of January 8, 2005, an explosion occurred on asmall pipeline delivering homeheating fuel to a residential section of Bugulma, a city in southern Tatarstan,several hundred kilometers east of Moscow.Ishmuratov and his wife lived in a small town not far away. There were nocasualties in the explosion. After several months of being called in forincreasingly aggressive questioning and harassment (documented later in thisreport), Ishmuratov was taken into custody on April1, 2005, from the Bugulma mosque where he worked as a guard.On April13, he described the initial period of his detention in a four-page handwritten statement that was later smuggled out of theAlmetevsk detention facility. His statement said that duringthe first few days of interrogations he refused to confess to the crime. But on April5, he was brought for the first time to the FSB, where the interrogation turnedviolent. He wrote,At around 3 p.m.,they took me to the FSB, into a room for visitors where two employees of thepolice organized crime unit [UBOP]named Farid and Damir forced me totake off my clothes.I stripped to my underwear; the window was open and itwas very cold.Then they started to beatme up.They punched me in my head andface, knocked me on the floor and kicked me.Kuzmin [Nikolai A. Kuzmin, head of the Bugulma City Internal AffairsDepartment] and Engalychev [Ravil Rinatovich,head of the Bugulma branch of the FSB] were present.Kuzmin also hit me a few times.They demanded that I give a confession of myparticipation in the pipeline explosion.During all this theythreatened to call in my mother and my pregnant wife for questioning.They also brought in a copy of the Koran andwere throwing it around and coveringit with cigarette ashes, which put strong pressure on my religiousfeelings.Kuzmin said he'd already"worked over" Ildar Valiev and my brother Rustam Khamidullin and that they'dgiven the necessary testimony.Kuzminsaid, "Your brother lasted two days, how long will you hold out?" Around 11 p.m. I agreed to give them thetestimony they needed.I agreed to give[it], being unable to withstand the physical and psychological pressure, andalso out of concern for my wife and unborn child They warned me that I had tostick to the testimony in all my interrogations, otherwise they'd beat me upagain.[67]Ishmuratov's mother told Human Rights Watch that security serviceofficers brought Ishmuratov inhandcuffs to the maternity hospital, where his wife had just delivered a baby,to put pressure on his family not to hire a lawyer to pursue complaints ofabuse.[68]Ishmuratov's lawyer told Human Rights Watchthat his client knew that his brother had been taken into custody, and thisadded to the psychological pressure on Ishmuratov.[69](Ishmuratov's brother, Rustam Khamidullin, told Human Rights Watch that policefrom the Tatarstan republic-level UBOP detained him at his aunt's house inNefteyugansk, Khanti-Mansiisk districtin western Siberia,on March 31, 2005. Police held him for several days at the Nefteyugansk policestation and beat him while he was handcuffed to a radiator to coerce him toadmit that he had witnessed preparations for the crime.Police then took him by train to Tatarstan. Khamidullin told Human Rights Watchthat he was kept in a regular compartment of a passenger train and beaten onthe head and body during the two-daytrain journey.[70])Ishmuratov later recanted his confession in both his 2005 trial and 2006 retrial.Ishmuratov's April13 statement asked for a criminalcase to be opened against the men who had beaten him in detention and endedwith two stark sentences: "I ask you to help me escape from torture and obtainjustice. I'm a former prisoner ofthe American camp at Guantanamo, where I endured the bullying of the American military, and now I'm treated even worse bythe special forces and law enforcement authoritiesof Russia."[71]No investigation of his allegations of mistreatment was ever undertaken. He wasultimately sentenced to 11 years and one month in prison,in part on the basis of the confession that he says he was beaten andthreatened into giving.Ravil GumarovRavil Gumarov was detained on April1, 2005, on suspicion of participating with Ishmuratov in the Bugulma pipelineexplosion.According to Gumarov heconfessed to the pipeline explosion as a result of torture by FSB and UBOPofficials, even though he later recanted that confession in courttestimony.He was convicted and sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment.Toward the end of January 2005 Rustam Garifullin, the deputy director of the UBOP inNaberezhnyi Chelni, Tatarstan, had summoned Gumarov to ask him whether he wasinvolved in the pipeline incident, but did not arrest him. Then on April 1 Garifullindetained Gumarov at his mother's apartment, supposedly just to ask a fewquestions. The next time she saw her son was in court several months later.[72]Gumarov told Human Rights Watch that he was deprived of sleep for seven or eight days after hisarrest in Naberezhnyi Chelny. He was kept in a tiny cage, about one meter byhalf a meter, where he was allowed to sit on a tiny bench during the day while being interrogated, but at nighthe was fastened by one handcuff to the bars of the cage over his head.He was continually asked to confess to thepipeline explosion.After a week or 10days he was transferred to a room in the administrativebuilding housing the FSB in Bugulma.There he was tortured using a common technique of Russian lawenforcement:a gas mask is put over thedetainee's head and then the oxygen is turned off, producing the beginnings ofasphyxiation and a sense of panic.[73]This form of torture is known in Russia as "little elephant," or "slonik," because the tube dangling fromthe front of the mask resembles thetrunk of an elephant.Gumarov told Human Rights Watch that investigators alsopulled hairs from his beard, and on one occasion poured an entire bottle of vodkadown his throat, a particularly offensive form of mistreatment for an observantMuslim."I hadn't had any alcohol forseven years, they poured a bottle in me and I was out of it," he told HumanRights Watch.[74]Gumarov told a Moscowpress conference that at one point, while he was being beaten on his back toforce a confession, he said, "What are you doing? This is like 1937 [the heightof Stalin's repression]," and they answered, "If this were 1937, you'd havebeen shot a long time ago."[75]He told his mother that investigators had drugged him with a special kind oftea to get him to sign a confession. Eventually, he did. In a handwritten letter that was smuggled out of the detentionfacility in Bugulma and brought to his mother, Gumarov wrote,Mama, don't listen to the authorities,no matter what they say about me My nerves gave in, I couldn't take it. Ispoke against myself and the worst thing is that I spoke against others.Everyone has a limit for what theycan take, and many break sooner or later. They broke me too. It seems I'mdestined to serve time for something I didn't do.[76]Harassment and Arbitrary DetentionFaced with the return of seven former detainees from Guantanamo, Russian lawenforcement might legitimately have been expected to keep an eye on whether themen were engaged in any suspicious activity after they got home. Suchsurveillance could have been conducted while also respecting the ex-detainees'human rights. It was not.The detainees and their family membersuniformly complained of being frequently called, followed, and threatened bythe FSB, UBOP, and other police officials after their return.Some family membersreported that their homes were searched without warrants, in violation ofRussian and international law.Somereported, in fact, that their homes were so frequently searched that they wereunable to provide exact dates of those searches.Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch that officials fromthe FSB and UBOP called him at least once a week, beginning right away after he returned home from thePyatigorsk prison to NaberezhnyiChelny. They frequently requested that he come down to their offices for questioning, and a car followed hisevery movement outside the home for about a month after he returned.[77]Two investigators from the FSB and the UBOPcalled so often that Gumarov's mother recognized their voices and knew theirnames and telephone numbers."Theycalled Ravil in all the time, whenever anything happened There was a shootingsomewhere, and they called him in; somebody committed a murder somewhere, andagain they called him in."[78]After being released from Pyatigorsk in June 2004, RuslanOdizhev returned to his family's home in Nalchik.According to his mother the harassment beganimmediately: "They came all thetime, threatening, calling him all the time to the department, the firstdepartment, the sixth department [the UBOP, which was] well-known to us, theGestapo."She drew aside the curtain atthe apartment's window to point out to Human Rights Watch researchers where amodest, unmarked car used to be always parked, so the FSB could keep an eye ontheir movements.[79]For other former Guantanamodetainees the harassment did not begin rightaway.Timur Ishmuratov said he believedthe words of the high-ranking FSB official who told all the detainees, as theywere preparing to leave the Russiandetention facility in Pyatigorsk, that if they lived within the law they wouldnot face any harassment."I believedhim, I got out, tried to build apersonal life, got married, tried to find work," he said.[80]He moved to the small town of Urussu, near Bugulma,where he found temporary jobs on construction sites and working for amosque.But in mid-January 2005, about aweek after the explosion on a local gas pipeline (describedabove), his mother called from Bugulma to say securityoperatives were looking for him.Ishmuratov went into Bugulma voluntarily,thinking he could easily demonstrate his innocence, and found a large group ofofficials from the FSB and the UBOP waiting for him.They interrogated him for six hours.To his surprise,although they asked a few questions about where he had been on January 8 (theday of the explosion) and the day before, most of the questions were about Guantanamo, Islam, theRussian officials he had spoken with in Pyatigorsk, and who figured in hiscurrent circle of acquaintances.Afterthat he was called in for questioning often, sometimes two to three times aweek.And although the earlyinterrogations were mostly respectful, over time they grew increasinglyaggressive and vulgar.Ishmuratov wasparticularly offended by the interrogators' use of curse words, since he hadnot used such words in the five years since he had become an observantMuslim."I thought because I was innocent,it would stop," he said of the harassment.[81]After his release from Pyatigorsk, Shamil Khazhiev returnedto Uchali, a small town in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan,where his family lived. Human rightsactivist Alexandra Zernova, who met with Khazhiev on several occasions, saidthat he was repeatedly questioned by local FSB and UBOP officials after hisreturn, and was briefly detained in Ufa, the Bashkortostancapital, in December 2004, onsuspicion of membership in Hizbut-Tahrir. He was released withoutcharge. In September 2005, while riding on a train, he was questioned by UBOPofficials from Samara.According toZernova, Khazhiev has been unable to secure employment since his return from Guantanamo.[82]He left Russiain March 2007.Airat Vakhitovtold Human Rights Watch that he was subjected to constant police harassment andmistreatment over the course of nearly two years after his release frompost-Guantanamo detention in Pyatigorsk."They constantly called me in for interrogation and told me they werefollowing me, so that I mustn't think I'd be at liberty for long," Vakhitov told Human Rights Watch.He moved around constantly, sleeping indifferent places, because "I'm afraid to stay in one place in Russia."[83]In early April2005, acquaintances at UBOP in Tatarstan, where Vakhitovwas from, warned him he should go into hiding."I was in hiding for several months in variousapartments, giving my tailers the slip. There was always a tail."[84]During this periodthe authorities called Vakhitov on his cell phone and told him that hisrequest for a passport for foreign travel had been granted.When he went into the passport office in Kazan,"the boss of the passport desk placed a call to [law enforcement] operativesand started stalling for time.Iunderstood that they were going to arrest me. In fact my passport wasn't readyyet; they had tricked me.I stood in the corridorand saw the group of goons, and then quietly I got out of there."[85]Vakhitov moved toMoscow, wherehe was joined by fellow ex-Guantanamo detainee Rustam Akhmiarov.On August 27, 2005, Vakhitovand Akhmiarov were seized from theapartment of Islamic activist[86]Gaidar Jemal by unidentified men, whom Vakhitovbelieves were from the UBOP.Beforebeing removed from the apartment, Vakhitovand Akhmiarov managed to call ajournalist and soon the news of their seizure was being relayed over EkhoMoskvy , an independent radio station broadcasting in the Russiancapital.These radio reports may haveprompted a sudden phone call to their two captors as Vakhitovand Akhmiarov were being driven outside Moscowalong a lonely road surrounded by forest.Vakhitov told Human RightsWatch that the caller appeared to have told the captors that they had to changeplans; the car turned around and headed for Sheremetyevo airport instead, andfrom there Vakhitov and Akhmiarov were flown to a detention facility in Kazan.According to Vakhitovthey were not mistreated in detention, although an official of the Tatarstanprocuracy describedthem publicly as terrorists, withoutproviding any evidence.In violation ofRussian law, neither man was present duringa court hearing that sanctionedtheir continued detention.[87]On August 30 Amnesty International issued anurgent action appeal on their behalf, while Alexandra Zernova gave severalinterviews from Londonand called Russian authorities toprotest the detention. The two men were not formally charged, and were releasedin Naberezhnyi Chelny on September 2, 2005.[88]Rasul Kudaev was also the target of frequent harassment andthreats by law enforcement personnel, sometimes in uniform and sometimes not,after his release from post-Guantanamo detention in Pyatigorsk.Sometimes they came to speak to him at hishome in Khasania.Sometimes they tookhim away for questioning.For example,in June 2005 authorities visited himand threatened to arrest him for evading military servicein the Russian army and falsifying documents. On August 15, 2005, two men in masks and twowithout masks came to his home and said they wanted to speak with him aboutRuslan Odizhev, the other former Guantanamodetainee who lived nearby.Theseunidentified agents took him to the officesof the UBOP and interrogated him for several hours, without presenting anyidentification, warrants, or other documentation."From the moment he returned home in '04, when the Americans turned him over from the Guantanamo camp,we've been under continuous pressure from law enforcement and special forces,trying repeatedly to fabricate criminal charges against him," Kudaev's mother,Fatimat Tekaeva, told Human Rights Watch.[89]In addition to threats, phone calls, visits, and repeateddetentions for questioning by law enforcement, the former Guantanamo detainees suffered from a moresubtle, but highly disruptive, form of harassment: the difficulty of gettingRussian authorities to return theirbasic identity documents.Without suchdocuments, the former detainees experiencedgreat difficulty in finding a job, housing, and medical treatment.The lack of official identity papers posed a particularly serious problem for Rasul Kudaev, who had received serious injuriesin Afghanistan and wasstill suffering the aftereffects,according to his mother.The familynegotiated with a hospital to remove a bullet from Kudaev's hip that wascausing him pain and impeding his movement, but they were unable to get thepersonal identity documents that the hospital required before it could treathim.Kudaev's mother told Human RightsWatch,The fact was, we couldn't get a copy of his birthcertificate for half a year!Every daywe drove around the district: threehours here, three hours there.And wherewas I supposed to get money for all this? They wouldn't give us the documentsHow much my nerves suffered, how much my health, and how much money I spent onthis, only Allah knows.And then we got[the document], and then we had to get a passport, and then we needed a medicalinsurance policy, because you can't get [medical] treatment in Russiawithout that.We'd just gotten thepassport, and a month later the events [of October 13, and Kudaev's arrest]happened.We just didn't make it in timefor the operation.[90]Although obtaining official documents from the Russianbureaucracy can be a trying experience for anyone, not only a former detainee of Guantanamo, such anextremely attenuated process is highly unusual.Ruslan Odizhev was also unable to obtain his internalpassport (national identity document), which was necessary to obtain formalwork.His mother believes that pressurefrom the FSB kept the local police from giving him the document because it wasonly through the intervention of a friendlyFSB officer that Odizhev finally didreceive his passport in spring 2005.However, he went into hiding soon thereafter, never having had a formal jobafter his release from Guantanamo.[91]Ravil Gumarov found it difficult to find work, even once hisidentity papers had been returned to him. "It's like there's a stamp on us," hesaid at a Moscowpress conference in October 2005. "We're like, out of Guantanamo, and they stamp you and no onewill hire you, it's impossible to set yourself up anywhere."[92]He later told Human Rights Watch, "Even friendswon't give you work [after Guantanamo]because they're afraid of the FSB."[93]Criminal Investigations and ProsecutionGumarov and Ishmuratov have stood trialtwice (in 2005 and 2006) and gone through an appeal hearingfor the Bugulma pipeline explosion. The trialswere riddled with proceduralirregularities that call into serious question whether their rightto a fair trial was respected.Those irregularitiesstarted with neither man being given immediateaccess to a lawyer, although both asked for them. Ishmuratov said that he beganasking for a lawyer on April 1, theday he was detained.[94]In September 2005a jury at the Tatarstan Supreme Court in Kazanunanimously acquitted Gumarov, Ishmuratov, and a third defendant, Fanis Shaikhutdinov,of the pipeline explosion.The event washailed in the media as "the firsttime in Russia a not-guiltyverdict is reached in a terrorismcase," and the three men gave a press conference in Moscow describingtheir mistreatment in detention.[95]Prosecutors submitted a request to the Supreme Court ofRussia to "annul" the acquittal, a request that was granted on January 17, 2006.Annulments of jury verdicts are not uncommonin Russia,despite the prohibition on double jeopardy under both Russian and internationallaw. The procurator general of Tatarstan, Kafil Amirov, insisted that the secondtrial did not constitute doublejeopardy because the first verdict had been "annulled" ["otmenyon"], as though it had never existed. He said, "We think thejurors took this case too lightly. They didn't fully understand they're simplepeople."[96]Gumarov and Shaikhutdinovwent into hiding in Moscow,where they were rearrested in the apartment of Airat Vakhitov.Ishmuratov fled to Ukraineon January 27 and attempted to claim political asylum. His request was deniedand he was deported back to Russiaon February 6.[97]The second trial,also a jury trial in the TatarstanSupreme Court, ended on May 5, 2006, with a unanimous vote to convict all three defendants of terrorism (article 205 of the Russian Criminal Code) and illegal possession of weapons orexplosives (article 222). They were also ordered to pay the equivalent of aboutUS$2,000 in property damages.On May 12the court sentenced Gumarov to 13 years of imprisonment,and Ishmuratov to 11 years and one month; FanisShakhutdinov was sentenced to 15years and five months.Lawyers and relatives of the accused expressed suspicionthat two juries could reach suchdiametrically different verdicts,and believe that the second jury was pressured to convict.Defense lawyers appealed the case to the Russian Supreme Court in July 2006,arguing that the case should be retrieddue to procedural irregularities,including the prosecution'sintroduction of new witnesses without any opportunity for pretrial cross-examination, as required by Russian law.The three-judge panel of the Supreme Court returned its decision on November29, 2006, after half an hour of deliberation. The panel reduced thesentences of each of the three defendants, without making any change to theverdicts (although the harshness of the sentences had not been a feature of theappeals, which were rejected in full).[98]In July 2006 Human Rights Watch found a signed confession tothe Bugulma pipeline explosion in the case file of another criminal investigation. The five-page confession wassigned by Vilsur Khairullin, who was accused of conspiringto blow up key industrial targets inTatarstan in 2005. According to the document, the interrogation was conductedby an investigator in the serious crimes division of the Tatarstan procuracy, V.A. Maksimov, on July 7, 2005, between 10:10 a.m. and 1 p.m. In the confession,Khairullin says that he planned and executed the explosion alone.[99]Gumarov and Ishmuratov were in custody at the timeKhairullin made his confession, awaiting trialfor the same crime. Yet prosecutorsnever mentioned the confession to lawyers for either defendant. InvestigatorMaksimov told the Washington Postthat he took Khairullin to the scene of the crime, but Khairullin was unable to identify theexact location of the explosion, so they did not feel it necessary to informdefense lawyers for Gumarov, Ishmuratov, and Shaikhutdinovabout his confession.[100]Given the record of torture among Russian investigators, itseems entirely possible that Khairullin's confession was not genuine. But as amatter of due process, such potentially exculpatory evidence should have beenmade available to the defendants.And ifthe confession was not genuine, it raises the question of what methods Russianinvestigators might have used to extractit.Rasul Kudaev, the other ex-Guantanamo detainee currently indetention, has not yet been formally indicted or prosecuted, more than one yearafter his arrest in Nalchik.Kudaev's extensive torture by Russian authoritieswas detailed above.In addition,Kudayev's right under Russian andinternational law to be represented by a lawyer was compromised when Irina Komissarova, his originallawyer, was removed from the case.ConclusionThe motivations of the Russian government in thispost-Guantanamo story remain obscure.The Procuracy General, whichnegotiated the detainees' return with the Americans,supposedly pledged to prosecute them for terrorism.Yet Russian officials made at best desultory attempts to build cases againstthe seven men. Both Gumarov and Vakhitovtold Human Rights Watch that while in detention in Pyatigorsk they wereinterrogated only once, and even then somewhat haphazardly. Gumarov told HumanRights Watch that his interrogator seemed to be trying to figure out if he,Gumarov, had actually been sent to Afghanistanfor Russian intelligence.[101]Later, when they were released, the detaineeswere given the impression that the Russian Ministryof Foreign Affairs intervened on their behalf, to spite the Americans. But at that time they did not encounter officials from any ministrywho seemed truly keen to prosecute. Moreover, the decision to release suchinternationally significant prisonerswould likely have been taken at a higher level than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the moment of release,according to Gumarov, Russian officials were portraying themselves to thedetainees in a positive light. "The Americanswanted to put you away, but we're letting you out, we're such good guys,"Gumarov quoted Russian officials as saying.[102]Local Russian officials were the ones who tortured,harassed, and mistreated the ex-Guantanamo detainees. There is no evidence tosuggest that they did so according to a specific directive from the nationalgovernment. But this does not absolve Moscowof responsibility for the fate of these seven men. The obligation not totolerate torture stems from the Russian government's signature and ratificationof the Convention against Torture, as well as many other international treatiesand agreements.This obligation was not, in fact, derivedfrom the flimsy, non-binding agreement that the Russian and American governments mentioned at the time of thedetainees' transfer. Indeed, the evidence of torture and mistreatment presentedin this report demonstrates the fundamental powerlessness of such a "diplomaticassurance." When a government is failing to honor its basic obligation not totorture suspects in its custody-when it is violating its own promises underinternational law-unenforceable bilateral agreements about torture do notprovide any additional safeguards for detainees.Nor do such agreements lift any legal obligations for thecountry sending the detainee back home.Since September 11, 2001, the US government has advanced severalnovel and pernicious interpretations of international law, including the law on torture. The Bush administration's attack on the Geneva Conventions, forexample, has ignited a storm of criticismworldwide. Unfortunately, the USgovernment's novel and pernicious use of "diplomatic assurances" has not beenas widely condemned by the international community-in large part because othergovernments, particularly Western European states and Canada, are using them too. Thesegovernments have played, therefore, an indirect role in the shameless use of"diplomatic assurances" that is describedin this report.Immediateresponsibility for the suffering ofthese seven Russian men lies of course with the Russian government.But the US government must bear its shareof the blame as well. Given the commonplace nature of torture by Russian lawenforcement, it seems implausible that the Americanscould have sent home these seven men, branded as they were by the "stamp of Guantanamo," and expectedthem to suffer anything less than the misery that they have, in fact, endured.AcknowledgementsThis report was writtenby Carroll Bogert, associatedirector of Human Rights Watch, and researched together with the deputydirector of Human Rights Watch's Moscowoffice, Alexander Petrov, and Moscowofficedirector Allison Gill.

Letter to the US officialsSeptember 27, 2006Sandy HodgkinsonU.S. Department of State2201 C Street NWWashington, DC20520Dear Ms.Hodgkinson:I am writing to youfor information about the seven Russian citizens who were repatriated to the Russian Federation from the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,on February 28, 2004.Russian and U.S.media have provided somewhat contradictory accounts of this repatriation, so Ihope to ascertain the facts by turning directly to you. Human Rights Watch iscurrently preparing a report on the treatment of former Guantanamodetainees after the return to Russia,and this information will be critical to providing a full account of theirexperience.As you may know,Human Rights Watch is an international human rights research and advocacyorganization, working in more than 70 countries around the world. For theaccuracy and credibility of our reports, we seek information about human rightsabuse from a wide variety of sources, including governments.In particular, weare interested in the following information:1)The U.S. State Department's statement on March1, 2004 says that "The transfer is the result of discussions between our twogovernments over the past year, including assurances that the individuals willbe detained, investigated and prosecuted, as appropriate, under Russian law andwill be treated humanely in accordance with Russian law and obligations." Whatwas the substance of these assurances? Were they made in written or oral form?If written form, could a copy of them be provided to Human Rights Watch?2)The detainees with whom I spoke said that theytalked to both US officialsand the ICRC about their fears of being returned to Russia. Did anyone in the USgovernment respond formally to the detainees' concerns? Did the ICRC convey thedetainees' concerns to the USgovernment, and if so, how did the US government respond to them?3)Did the U.S. government put in place anymonitoring mechanism to determine if the detainees were, in fact, treatedhumanely by the Russians after their return?4)The March 1, 2004 statement of the GeneralProcuracy of the RussianFederation stated that "charges had beenfiled" against all seven detainees. Did the U.S. government provide case fileson the detainees to the Russian government to substantiate such charges?5)Why was Russian citizen Ravil Mingazov not partof the agreement that secured the release of the other seven detainees? Is theRussian government currently attempting to secure his release from Guantanamo?6)Did the Russian government give advance noticeto the U.S.government that it intended to release the seven men on June 22, 2004? If not,how did the U.S.government learn of their release? Did the U.S. government raise anyobjections to their release, either before or after June 22, 2004?Thank you inadvance for your assistance. If you have any questions, please do not hesitateto contact me at 212-216-1244.Sincerely,Carroll BogertAssociate DirectorHuman Rights WatchAppendix II.

For this reason we turn to you with a request for reliableinformation.As you may know, Human Rights Watch is a neutral,international, non-governmental human rights organization with headquarters inthe United States andoffices in London, Geneva,Brussels, Moscowand Tashkent.We have written a great deal about human rights abuses at GuantanamoBay,and wish to supplement this work with information about the return of former Guantanamo detainees totheir home countries. We are also turning to the U.S. authorities for suchinformation.In particular, we are interested in the followinginformation:1)The 1 March statement of the General Procuracyof the Russian Federationstated that charges had been filed against all seven detainees. What were thosecharges? On what date were those charges dropped? Why were they dropped?2)The 1 March statement also says that"All these people were recruited byrepresentatives of radical Islamic organizations and later sent over to Afghanistan,where they fought on the side of the Taliban."Does the General Procuracy still believe this to be the case? Whatevidence did the Russian government have for that assertion at the time? Didthe U.S.government provide case files on the detainees to substantiate such charges?Had all seven individuals come to the attention of Russian law enforcementbefore they left Russia for Afghanistan?3)The 1 March statement by the U.S. StateDepartment says that "The transfer is the result of discussions between our twogovernments over the past year, including assurances that the individuals willbe detained, investigated and prosecuted, as appropriate, under Russian law andwill be treated humanely in accordance with Russian law and obligations." Whatwas the substance of these assurances? Were they made in written or oral form?If written form, could a copy of them be provided to Human Rights Watch?4)As part of those assurances, did the Russiangovernment provide any kind of regular updates on the detainees' status to the U.S.authorities? Did U.S.authorities ever make any formal subsequent inquiries about the detainees'condition?5)Why was Russian citizen Ravil Mingazov not partof the agreement that secured the release of the other seven detainees? Is theRussian government currently attempting to secure his release from Guantanamo?Thank you in advance for your assistance in this regard. Ifyou need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact our Moscow office at 737-8955.With best regards,Carroll BogertAssociate DirectorHuman Right Watch[1] An eighth Russian citizen,Ravil Mingazov, remains in custody in Guantanamoat this writing.[2] Human Rights Watch telephoneinterview with Airat Vakhitov, September 7, 2006.[3] Their names have beenspelled differently in different databases and some detainees have even beenlisted under different names. For example, Rasul Kudaev is referred to asAbdullah Kafkas in one US Department of Defense list. This report uses standardtransliteration from Cyrillic of thedetainees' names as they were commonly known in Russian.[4] Many of them spoke anotherlocal language such as Tatar, in addition to Russian.[5] Rasul Kudaev told reportersthat he did not support Islamic government because he had seen how such agovernment operates in Afghanistan, and"there's war there all the time." See "Rasul Kudaev, arrested inKabardino-Balkaria, has not turnedup in Pyatigorsk prison" ("Rasula Kadaeva, arestovanogo vKabardino-Balkarii, v pyatigorskoityurme ne okazalos"), Caucasian KnotNews, January 20, 2006,http://www.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/news/id/922021.html(accessed July 22, 2006). At least three of the detainees said they went to Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic bordering on Afghanistan, because of repressionagainst Muslims in Russia.They claim they were seized there by fighters for the Islamic Movement ofUzbekistan and taken to Afghanistan, wherethey were imprisoned.[6] Ruslan Odizhev was notinterviewed by Reprieve because hequickly went into hiding after his return to Russia. Interviews with Reprieve on file with Human Rights Watch.[7] Although the Russiandetainees' allegations were taken in the context of preparinglitigation, their accounts are consistent with numerous other accounts ofdetainee abuse at Guantanamo collected by Human Rights Watch in its research inAfghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, SaudiArabia, and the UK and other accounts and reports collected for the DetaineeAbuse and Accountability Project, a joint project of Human Rights Watch, HumanRights First, and the New York University Center for Human Rights and GlobalJustice.
