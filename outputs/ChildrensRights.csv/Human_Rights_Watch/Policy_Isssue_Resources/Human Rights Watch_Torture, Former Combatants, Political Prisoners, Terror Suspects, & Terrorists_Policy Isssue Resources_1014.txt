Authorities have detained and often prosecuted people for expressing views critical of the government, taking part in peaceful activism or human rights work, or associating with members of the former opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) by “eating Khmer noodles.” The dissolution of the CNRP by the government-controlled Supreme Court prior to the July 2018 elections assured that the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) would win all 125 seats in the national parliament, effectively making Cambodia a one-party state.A series of repressive laws and amendments to existing laws adopted in recent years have provided the authorities with legal tools to arbitrarily arrest and detain individuals for the expression of their opinions, including online, associating with others in groups, or conducting peaceful public assemblies.Unlike after previous elections in 2008 and 2013, Prime Minister Hun Sen’s threatening political rhetoric towards dissidents and political opponents has not cooled off one year later. With the help of its politicized and corrupt judiciary, the Cambodian government stepped up its harassment of former CNRP officials and activists. Kem Sokha, the CNRP leader, remains under indefinite house arrest linked to fabricated treason charges. Sam Rainsy and other senior CNRP leaders are in self-imposed exile, and face arrest warrants if they return. Sam Rainsy’s announcement that he and other CNRP exiles would return to Cambodia in November has prompted the government to allege the CNRP is plotting a coup. Since the CNRP announcement on August 16, the government has threatened charges against more than 50 former CNRP members and detained at least 30 of them.Civil society activists, human rights defenders, journalists, and ordinary citizens expressing critical opinions online and offline are regular targets of the government. Trials are conducted in complete disregard of international fair trial standards, with government-controlled judges reaching verdicts in advance of the trials.Concerned governments and donors should respond to the Cambodian government’s widespread human rights violations by strengthening public criticism and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and others held for the peaceful exercise of their basic rights.POLITICAL PRISONERSChao VeasnaChao Veasna, 54Sentenced: 5 yearsChao Veasna, an ethnic Khmer Krom, was a Poipet commune council deputy chief from the Candlelight Party (renamed from the Sam Rainsy Party after the law changed to ban the use of a person’s name in the name of a political party). During an anti-government protest outside the Poipet customs office in May 2015 at which Veasna was not present, military police fired warning shots to disperse protesters and seriously beat one protester. With commune elections scheduled for June 2017, on February 16, 2017, a Banteay Meanchey Provincial Court investigating judge questioned Veasna for four hours and sent him to Banteay Meanchey provincial prison in connection with the May 2015 protest. Veasna was charged with inciting the commission of a felony (articles 494 and 495 of the Criminal Code) and, as an accomplice, with intentional damage with aggravating circumstances (general aggravation and in relation to status of the victim) (articles 29, 410, 411 and 412), as well as with intentional damage with aggravating circumstances (using dangerous means and causing injury) (articles 413 and 414). On June 7, 2018, the Provincial Court convicted and sentenced Veasna to five years’ imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay a total of approximately US$15,000 for damages to the customs office building and several cars.Thun ChanthaThun Chantha, 44On February 26, 2021, police arrested Thun Chantha, a former commune chief for the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Phnom Penh’s Toul Kork district.On February 28, the Phnom Penh court charged him with “incitement to commit a felony” (articles 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) and sent him to pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Correctional Center 1 (CC1).On February 18, Chantha had expressed criticism on his Facebook page of Cambodia’s use of the Chinese-made Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, stating that Cambodians were being forced to take the vaccine even though they did not want to be vaccinated. The vaccine has been widely viewed with skepticism in Cambodia.Mey SophornMey Sophorn, 43On February 27, 2021, police arrested Mey Sophorn, an activist of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) and a member of a group of relatives of detained opposition activists (“Satrey Khlarhann,” or “Brave Women”) who organize regular Friday protests calling for the release of their relatives.On February 28, the Phnom Penh court charged her with “incitement to commit a felony” (articles 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) and sent her to pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Correctional Center 2 (CC2).On February 9, Sophorn had expressed criticism on her Facebook page of Cambodia’s use of the Chinese-made Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine. She said: “Why is the one-party government rushing to call on the Cambodian people to be injected by Chinese vaccines, which have not yet been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO)?”Kong MasKong Mas, 37On December 31, 2020, police arrested Kong Mas, a youth member of the arbitrarily dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in Svay Rieng province, after he joined a protest in front of a Phnom Penh court calling for the release of detained CNRP members and trade union leader Rong Chhun. The same day, the Phnom Penh municipal court charged him with “conspiracy” (article 453 of Cambodia’s penal code) and ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Correctional Center 1 (Prey Sar) prison. Police had previously arrested Kong Meas on January 16, 2019, after he posted on Facebook that the EU was planning to impose a tariff on Cambodian rice. On January 19, the investigating judge sent him to pre-trial detention after charging him with public insult and incitement to commit a felony (articles 307 and 495 of Cambodia’s Penal Code). On October 18, a Phnom Penh court convicted him of incitement to commit a felony and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. After serving his 18-month prison sentence, which included time served in pre-trial detention between January and October 2019, the authorities released Kong Mas on July 23, 2020. Kong Mas is a known government critic who in the past organized and assisted with distribution of information, including political fliers, produced by acting head of the CNRP, Sam Rainsy.Sou YeanSou Yean, 45On October 22, 2020, the authorities arrested Sou Yean, a former provincial party chief of the of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in Prey Treak village, Teak commune, Memot district, Tbong Khmum province. On October 3, the authorities arrested and questioned three CNRP activists wearing t-shirts with Khmer imprint, saying “Thank you for peace, but respect Article 2 of the Constitution.” Article 2 upholds the territorial integrity of Cambodia. One of the activists, Sou Yean’s nephew, said that they acquired the t-shirts from Sou Yean. The authorities released the activists after signing pledges that they will stop from engaging in similar protest activities again – a common tactic by the authorities to stifle dissent. On October 23, the investigating judge of the Tbong Khmum provincial court charged Sou Yean with incitement to commit a felony (article 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) and ordered his pre-trial detention at Kampong Cham provincial prison. There is speculation his arrest may be related to his calls for activists to join protests on October 23, organized to mark the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, in front of Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh. Authorities previously arrested Sou Yean on April 22, 2019, and charged him with “incitement to commit a felony” based on his comments levelled at Prime Minister Hun Sen in a private message on Facebook. His message stated Hun Sen was not keeping his promises such as protecting Cambodia’s forests and fighting corruption and that “Hun Sen is just blind in one eye, while his supporters are blind in both eyes, and deaf too.” The private message was leaked and Pankhem Buthan, deputy chief of the prime minister’s cabinet and president of the Youth Federation of Senaneak, filed a legal complaint against Sou Yean. Upon serving his one-year prison sentence, the authorities released him on April 23, 2020.Ismail Pin OsmanClick to expand ImageIsmail Pin Osman, 45Ismail Pin Osman was a reserve National Assembly candidate for the CNRP in Kampong Cham province in the 2013 national election. He is a member of the ethnic Cham Muslim community. He was arrested by anti-trafficking police in Phnom Penh’s Russey Keo district on February 9, 2018, after returning from Thailand, where he had fled under pressure from authorities to defect to the ruling CPP. He is currently in pre-trial detention on charges of unlawfully removing female workers for cross-border transfer (article 11 of the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation). If convicted, he faces from 7 to 15 years in prison. On August 13, 2019, the Phnom Penh court convicted him and sentenced him to the maximum 15 years in prison. The court also convicted his uncle Ahmad Yahya, former Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation secretary of state, for the same offense and sentenced him to 15 years in prison.Sun Chan NoeurnSun Chan Noeurn, 34On April 8, 2017, a group of military police and soldiers arrested Net Sao, a former CNRP Krayear commune councilor in Kampong Thom province, along with land rights activist and local CNRP supporter, Sun Chan Noeurn.On April 9, Kampong Thom provincial court formally charged Sun Chan Noeurn and Net Sao and sent both to pre-trial detention. On January 24, 2018, the same court convicted Sun Chan Noeurn and Net Sao of obstructing deliberate duties and operations of officials (article 100 of the Forestry Law) and intentional violence (article 217 of the Cambodian Criminal Code) and sentenced both to three years in prison. On July 19, the Court of Appeal upheld the verdict.Net Sao ran as a commune chief candidate for the CNRP during the June 2017 commune council elections. He also intervened on behalf of several communities affected by land disputes in Krayear commune.Sok OudomSok OudomOn May 13, 2020, Kampong Chhnang police arrested Sok Oudom, owner of the Rithysen Radio station in Kampong Chhnang province, alleging he committed  “incitement to commit a felony” (article 495 of Cambodia’s penal code).Local police questioned him before sending him on May 14 to the Kampong Chhnang provincial court for further questioning. The police claimed that there was a complaint against the radio station but did not elaborate who the complainant was or what the allegations were about. The police argued that Sok Oudom’s broadcasts encouraged people to occupy state land at Phnom Oral Wildlife Sanctuary in Kampong Chhnang province. Oudom is held in pre-trial detention at Kampong Chnnang provincial prison, awaiting his trial.On May 12, the Ministry of Information revoked the media license for Rithysen Radio Station’s broadcasting on FM99.75 and the radio station’s website. The ministry claimed, but provided no evidence, that the station was “publishing information which is exaggerated information, contains incitement to violence, provocation to commit discrimination and provocation to cause social insecurity and chaos.”Oudom regularly reported on longstanding land disputes between local farming communities and powerful district officials. Local human rights NGO monitors said about the radio owner that “he always cares a lot about injustice in the society, the destruction of public property and abuses by the powerful .”Kak KomphearKak Komphear, 54On May 31, 2020, police arrested Kak Komphear, a former senior CNRP member in Phnom Penh, while he was fleeing to Takeo province. According to the arrest warrant, the authorities ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar Correctional Center (CC1) based on charges of “plotting” and “incitement to commit to a felony” (articles 453, 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) in a case file dated February 20, 2019 (Case file no. 1140).In a separate case (Case file no. 354) dated January 18, 2019, the Phnom Penh municipal court had convicted Komphear in absentia of instigating insult and incitement to commit a felony (articles 28, 494, 495 and 502 of Cambodia’s penal code) and sentenced him to one year and eight months in prison. As a result of staying in hiding, he has not yet served this prison sentence. The charges were based on allegations that he had participated in the government-labelled “Clean Finger” election boycott campaign around which the government manufactured a bogus narrative that the campaign was a coup by the opposition against the government.CNRP leader Mu Sochua  told VOD News that Komphear had been in hiding for over a year out of fear of being arrested. Before his arrest, he had received a phone call from an unidentified man asking him to identify himself on the phone. Later he noticed a man on a motorbike parked in front of his house in Phnom Penh, suspecting that he was going to be arrested. Thereupon, Komphear fled to Takeo by car but the authorities stopped his car and arrested him.Case no. 354 also involves CNRP figures Sam Rainsy and Ho Vann. In October 2019, the court convicted and sentenced them to the same degree as Komphear; however, both remain in exile and therefore have not served their prison sentences. On October 18, 2019, the authorities also tried an opposition activist, Kong Mas , based on insult and incitement charges and sentenced him to 18 months in prison.Pheat MabPheat Mab, 49On May 27, 2020, police arrested Pheat Mab, a former CNRP council member in Dom Tek commune, Sonikum district, in Siem Reap province. He is also a member of the Cambodian Independent Teachers' Association (CITA).Police took him to court the same day and the Phnom Penh municipal court charged Mab with “plotting,” “incitement to commit a felony,” and “inciting military personnel to disobedience” (articles 453, 494, 495 and 471 of Cambodia’s penal code). The authorities ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar Correctional Center (CC1).The authorities allege that the basis of his arrest is a phone conversation about the current microfinance debt crisis. It is unclear how the authorities learned of his private conversation and whether his phone was tapped – a practice that has resulted in previous arbitrary arrests of government critics.Sun ThunSun ThunOn June 1, 2020, four police officers arrested Sun Thun without an arrest warrant . He is a former elected CNRP council member in Thmey village, Treal commune, Tangkok district, in Kampong Thom province. He is also a member of the Cambodian Independent Teachers' Association (CITA).After a few hours of being held in custody at the Ministry of Interior, the authorities placed him in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar Correctional Center (CC1).The authorities took him to court the same day of his arrest, where the court charged him with “plotting,” “incitement to commit a felony,” and “inciting military personnel to disobedience” (articles 453, 494, 495 and 471 of Cambodia’s penal code).In June 2019, four unidentified men beat Thun while guiding them to go see a plot of land about which they had expressed interest. He reported that they had persuaded him to go with them to talk to the landowner. Thun claimed the attack was an act of “political retribution or intimidation” because he was a former senior CNRP official. He submitted a police complaint against the four men, whom he said he did not know, for attempted murder. Police claimed to be investigating but no arrests were ever made.Thun lost his political post along with all other elected CNRP officials upon the arbitrary dissolution of the party in November 2017. The Ministry of Education did not allow him to resume his teaching position, and he filed a complaint against that decision. In 2019, Thun had openly supported the announced return of exiled CNRP leadership in November that year.Thun’s arrest came hours before Prime Minister Hun Sen “vowed during a speech in Preah Sihanouk to arrest those he claimed intended to overthrow the government and sow social disorder .”Heng ChansothyHeng Chansothy, 56On the morning of June 5, 2020, police detained Heng Chansothy, a former CNRP deputy chief of Pur Sunchey district in Phnom Penh and sent him for pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar Correctional Center (CC1).Authorities previously arrested and charged Chansothy on November 6, 2019 with conspiracy and incitement to commit a felony (articles 453, 495, and 494 of Cambodia’s penal code). His detention occurred amidst a wave of arbitrary arrests of opposition members ahead of the announced return of exiled CNRP figures on November 9. A little more a week later, on November 15, the authorities released Chansothy on bail.On June 3, 2020, the authorities alleged he had violated his bail terms requiring him to report to the police station on a regular basis. Chansothy’s lawyer rejected  the allegation, stating that Chansothy had not received such orders to report from the court.On December 21, 2019, Chansothy was seriously injured near a gas station in Trapang Tea village, Trapang Krasang commune, Pursenchey district, Phnom Penh when two unidentified persons wearing helmets and driving a motorcycle hit him on the head with a metal pipe. The attack occurred at around 5:30 p.m. while he was driving his motorbike, coming from Kandal province. There were factory workers and other witnesses at the site when the attack happened. His son filed a complaint at the Trapang Krasang commune police station. Chansothy feared for his safety after the incident. The police never investigated the attack and no arrests were ever made.Khut ChroekKhut ChroekOn March 10, 2020, Preah Sdech district police arrested Khut Chroek (49 years old), a senior member of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Boeung Dol commune, Preah Sdach district, Prey Veng province. The authorities arrested him based on a critical Facebook post related to COVID-19, which authorities alleged was false information on the coronavirus. On March 11, the authorities charged him with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453 and 495 of Cambodia’s criminal code) and put him in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison.Ngin KheanNgin KheanOn March 17, 2020 at approximately 3 p.m., Phnom Penh police arrested Ngin Khean (29 years old) in Phnom Penh’s Steung Meanchey commune. He is the head of the youth wing of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Preah Sdach district of Prey Veng province. The authorities arrested him based on allegations he posted “fake news” about the coronavirus on his Facebook profile page. On the same day, the authorities charged him with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453 and 495 of Cambodia’s criminal code) and sent him to pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison facility. Ngin Khean is the brother-in-law of Khut Chroeuk, who was arrested in Prey Veng on March 10.Keo ThaiKeo ThaiOn March 26, 2020, Kampong Chhnang police arrested Keo Thai (50 years old), who is a former senior member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Por Pel commune, Bory Bo district, Kampong Chhnang province, and a member of the Cambodia Independent Teachers Association (CITA). Police surrounded his daughter’s house as part of their search for him. Police transported Thai to Phnom Penh and detained him at Prey Sar prison facility. According to his family, police arrested him without a warrant while confiscating his mobile phone, and the phones of his wife and daughter. The authorities charged Keo Thai with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code). On March 27, National Police Commission spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun alleged that Keo Thai “was on the court’s [black] list but was spared any legal action [with regard to other cases] by the government. Instead, he was put under court observation. After he was forgiven, he did not seem to change. He even created more problems by producing inciteful news, which means he did not change.” Earlier, in March 2020, police attempted to arrest Keo Thai for criticizing the government on Facebook, but he fled before police arrived. His daughter told Radio Free Asia that she was not sure why her father had been detained at this time because he had merely conducted online teaching after schools had been shut on March 16 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Keo Thai’s lawyer informed Radio Free Asia that he suffers from high blood pressure and must take medication daily.Thai SokuntheaThai SokuntheaOn March 26, 2020, Kampong Chhnang police arrested Thai Sokunthea, an activist of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Kampong Chnnang province. On March 29, the authorities charged Thai Sokunthea with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) and placed him in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar correctional facility. The reasons for his arrest are not clear but it appears connected to past arbitrary and politically motivated charges being reactivated against him. It appears that Thai Sokunthea has not made any critical Facebook postings in relation to the Cambodian government’s Covid-19 response.Yim SarethYim SarethOn March 27, 2020, Phnom Penh police arrested Yim Sareth (52 years old), a former commune councilor of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Romeas Hak district, Svay Rieng province. The authorities alleged he spread “fake news” about Covid-19 on his Facebook page. However, the only Facebook post that can be found is one from March 20 when he stated that he wears a mask to protect himself from dirt and cement dust, but his real fear is the coronavirus. The Phnom Penh municipal court charged him with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) and placed him in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar correctional facility. His lawyer informed Radio Free Asia that Yim Sareth suffers from high blood pressure and must take medication daily. Similar to other recently arrested former CNRP activists, the charges against Sareth consist of fabricated and politically motivated charges being reactivated against him as part of a wider crackdown against the opposition.Kheum PheanaKheum PheanaOn April 2, 2020, Phnom Penh police arrested Kheum Pheana (52 years old), a former senior member of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Phnom Penh. On April 3, the Phnom Penh court charged him with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code). The authorities ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar correctional center. The rationale for the charges is unclear because it appears that Pheana did not make any critical Facebook post in relation to the Cambodian government’s Covid-19 response.Chum ChanChum ChanOn April 13, 2020, police arrested Chum Chan (52 years old), a former council member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Prek Khser Khor commune, Peam Ro district, Prey Veng province. He is also a member of the Cambodian Independent Teachers Association in Prey Veng province. The authorities charged him with “plotting,” “inciting military personnel to disobedience” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 471, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) and ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar correctional center. These charges are based on an introductory submission issued by the prosecutor of the Phnom Penh municipal court dated July 11, 2018, approximately two weeks before the general elections on July 29, 2018.The authorities had told Chum Chan to come to a district police station in Prey Veng’s Peam Ro district for questioning, failing to mention the basis for questioning and the possibility of arrest. The authorities seized his two mobile phones, which he was carrying with him. His wife told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that she only found out two days after Chan’s arrest that he had been taken to Phnom Penh when he called her from inside the prison to ask for money to spend for basic needs in prison. A local human rights group, the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC), told RFA that Chan had been a teacher but was removed from the Ministry of Education’s list of registered teachers on January 30, 2018 due to his affiliation with the CNRP.Nhem VeanNhem VeanOn April 15, 2020, Banteay Meanchey police and national Ministry of Interior police arrested Nhem Vean (50 years old) in Poi Pet city, Banteay Meanchey province, at the border with Thailand. Nhem Vean is a former senior member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Svay Rieng province. The authorities charged him with “plotting,” “inciting military personnel to disobedience” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 471, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code). These allegations are old, reactivated charges imposed amidst a wider crackdown on the political opposition in 2018. He is currently held in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar correctional center. It appears that Vean has not posted any critical messages on his Facebook about the government’s Covid-19 response.Sok ChanthaSok ChanthaOn April 20, 2020, police arrested Sok Chantha (55 years old), a former senior member of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Kram village, Prey Veng province. The village chief allegedly invited Chantha to come to the commune council office to discuss a possible reduction in his debt payment with a microfinance institution in response to financial challenges caused by Covid-19. At the commune council office, police seized Chantha’s phone, arrested him and took him to Phnom Penh. The authorities failed to present an arrest warrant. The authorities took him to the Ministry of Interior and General Commissariat of National Police in Phnom Penh for further questioning without a lawyer present. The authorities charged him with “plotting,” “inciting military personnel to disobedience” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453, 471, 494, and 495 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) and, on April 22, placed him in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar correctional facility. The basis for his arrest is unknown. It appears that Chantha has not posted any critical messages on his Facebook about the government’s Covid-19 response.Ros SokhetRos SokhetOn June 25, 2020, the Phnom Penh municipal police’s Cybercrime Bureau arrested Ros Sokhet, the publisher of Cheat Khmer (“Khmer Nation”) newspaper, based on two posts on his Facebook page on June 24. The first post questioned Prime Minister Hun Sen’s declaration of intent to name Hun Manet, his eldest son, as his successor. The second post criticized the lack of government response to Cambodians who unable to pay off their micro-loan debts due to the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.On June 28, the Phnom Penh municipal court charged him with “incitement to commit a felony” (articles 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) based on allegations that the Facebook posts constituted “incitement to provoke serious chaos in social security.” If convicted, he could face up to two years in prison. Sokhet is in pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison.The Ministry of Information provided Cheat Khmer with its media licence in April 2020. However, at the time of his arrest, Ros Sokhet had not yet made any publications. After his arrest, the ministry announced it would review the license and might revoke it. If revoked, this would be the fourth time the authorities have revoked a media license granted to a local media outlet since the outbreak of Covid-19.Ros Sokhet has a history of publicly criticizing the government. In 2009, the authorities arrested and a court later convicted Ros Sokhet based on allegations of disinformation against a media personality, Soy Sopheap, the publisher of Deum Ampil newspaper.Since the pandemic, Cambodian authorities have detained two other journalists, Sok Oudom and Sovann Rithy, based on fabricated incitement charges. They are currently awaiting their trials.Ouk ChhumOuk Chhum, 74On July 10, 2020, police arrested Ouk Chhum, former elected Khlaeng Meas commune council chief for the disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in Battambang province. On July 8, Chhum allegedly had a phone conversation with another former local CNRP member, Lous Chenglay, with whom he discussed a YouTube video saying that a “fortune teller told the guy [Prime Minister Hun Sen] that he would die without a coffin and his wife would starve to death in 2023, and then the guy’s [Hun Sen’s] bodyguards killed the fortune teller.”The Phnom Penh municipal court charged Chhum with incitement to commit a felony (article 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) and ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison.It is unclear how the authorities learned about the private phone conversation since neither participant posted any information about the conversation. However, Cambodian authorities have engaged in unauthorized phone tapping against members of the political opposition members and civil society activists.Lous ChenglayLous Chenglay, 51On July 10, 2020, police arrested Lous Chenglay, former Bavel district party chief for the disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) ), in Battambang province. On July 8, Chenglay allegedly had a phone conversation with another former local CNRP member, Ouk Chhum , who told him about a YouTube video saying that a “fortune teller told the guy [Prime Minister Hun Sen] that he would die without a coffin and his wife would starve to death in 2023, and then the guy’s [Hun Sen’s] bodyguards killed the fortune teller.”The Phnom Penh municipal court charged Chenglay with incitement to commit a felony (article 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) and ordered his pre-trial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison.It is unclear how the authorities learned about the private phone conversation since neither participant posted any information about the conversation. However, Cambodian authorities have engaged in unauthorized phone tapping against members of the political opposition and civil society activists.In 2019, Chenglay had fled to Thailand due to fear of arrest amidst a crackdown on the political opposition. He had returned to Cambodia in early 2020.Long PharyLong PharyOn March 18, 2020, Phnom Penh police arrested Long Phary at Phnom Penh’s O’Russey market. He is a senior member of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Kampong Trabeik district, Prey Veng province. The authorities said that they arrested him based on a phone conversation he had about COVID-19, and alleged he was spreading what the government labelled as “fake news.” The authorities did not clarify how they learned about the contents of the conversation. On the same day, the authorities charged him with “plotting” and “incitement to commit felony” (articles 453 and 495 of Cambodia’s criminal code) and sent him to Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison.

Eight Prime Minister bodyguard unit officers led a contingent of more than 100 police to carry out the arrest. In a highly unusual move, authorities immediately sent him to the remote Trapeang Phlong prison (Correctional Center 3), in Tbaung Khmom province near the border with Vietnam. On the basis of a false allegation that he had committed a crime in flagrante delicto (caught in the act of committing a crime), the National Assembly stripped him of his parliamentary immunity.On September 5, 2017, prosecutors charged him with conspiring with a foreign power (article 443 of the Criminal Code). If convicted, he faces 15-30 years in prison. Sokha’s arrest came after Hun Sen accused him of plotting to topple the government with support from the United States based on a highly edited videotape of a speech Sokha gave in Australia in 2013. On May 26, 2018, the court summoned eight individuals – including members of nongovernmental organizations – to appear for questioning as witnesses in Sokha’s case.On April 19, 2018, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its Opinion No. 9/2018 declared Kem Sokha’s detention “arbitrary” and “politically motivated.”Sokha had been previously convicted in 2016 on politically motivated charges for failure to appear as a witness against two CNRP parliamentary members detained in a fabricated prostitution case. The court sentenced him to five months in prison, but he remained under de facto house arrest, surrounded by CNRP supporters and police outside CNRP headquarters until December 2016, when he received a royal pardon.On September 10, 2018, Sokha was released from prison and placed under house arrest. The court order specifically bans Sokha from meeting with “former officials of the Cambodian National Rescue Party… foreigners, especially those who may be involved in this case” and orders him to “refrain from a political meeting or other political activities…” Treason charges remain in force.On March 3, 2019, Kem Sokha had been detained for 18-months. Under Cambodian law, the investigating judge has 18 months to determine whether to release a detained person or to charge and bring them to trial.On March 19, the investigating judge rejected Sokha’s renewed request to drop the charges against him. The judge provided no update or additional information about the completion of his investigation and whether the case would be sent to trial.On November 10, 2019, the investigating judge decided to lift Sokha’s restrictive judicial supervision order that confined him to his residence, based on the condition that he not participate in political activities, not travel abroad, and continue to cooperate with judicial investigators. On December 3, the Phnom Penh court formally closed the investigation and sent the case to trial: “After investigation and questioning, the judge understands that there is enough evidence against the accused Kem Sokha.…” The investigating judge sent the case to trial, but a trial date has not yet been set.Human Rights Watch has repeatedly pressed the Cambodian government to drop the case against Sokha.Mao KungMao Kung, 40On January 28, 2021, police arrested Mao Kung, a Khmer-English translator at an NGO in Bak Ronoas village, Sangkhoar commune, Svay Rieng city, Svay Rieng province.Earlier that morning, police arrested Mao Kung’s 15-year-old son for allegedly having used a slingshot in a fight at school. The authorities arrested the son and sent him to Svay Rieng police station. Mao Kung went to the police station to see his son. He took a photo of his son in police custody and returned home. Shortly after he arrived at his house, 7 or 8 police officers who had followed him then arrested and transported him to the police station where he was held. The authorities confiscated his phone and searched it, discovering photos and video footage with former local opposition party members.On January 31, the Svay Rieng provincial court charged Mao Kung with violation of privacy (recording a person’s image, article 302 of Cambodia’s penal code) and ordered his pre-trial detention at Svay Rieng provincial prison. Meanwhile, his son was charged with intentional violence (article 513 of Cambodia’s penal code) and sent to pre-trial detention at the same prison. The authorities released Mao Kung on bail on February 10 after paying a bond of US$5000 to the court.Before the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), Mao Kung had taken part in CNRP political campaigns and activities; however, he held no formal party position.Kong RayaKong Raya, 28On July 9, 2019, Phnom Penh police arrested a student activist, Kong Raya, his wife, sister, and brother-in-law for printing T-shirts in memory of prominent political commentator Kem Ley, and for selling them on Facebook. On July 10, 2016, Kem Ley had been fatally shot in broad daylight at a gas station in central Phnom Penh. While authorities released Raya’s family members after being forced to sign a “confession” that they would not repeat the act – a requirement that Cambodian authorities frequently impose on released activists – the authorities held Raya overnight at the Phnom Penh police station. On July 11, the Phnom Penh court charged Raya with incitement and sent him to pretrial detention at Phnom Penh’s Correctional Center 1 (CC1). On August 13, 2019, the Phnom Penh court denied Raya bail. On November 4, the Supreme Court upheld the denial of bail.On July 10, a group of Kem Ley supporters gathered at the Caltex gas station where Kem Ley had been killed in 2016. About 50 members of various security forces surrounded them and prevented them from laying floral wreaths or drinking coffee at the station while wearing T-shirts depicting Kem Ley. Those wearing shirts were required to take them off or place other garments over them.In total, authorities detained nine people for marking the third anniversary of Kem Ley’s death.In August 2015, Raya had been convicted of “incitement to commit a felony” for a Facebook post in which he called for a so-called “color revolution” – which the Cambodian government uses as a pretext to silence its critics – and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. Soung Neak Poan, a youth activist who distributed posters calling for an end to extrajudicial killings, was charged on the same day with the same crime as Raya. He spent a little over five months in pretrial detention at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison facility.On November 29, the Phnom Penh court responded to earlier requests by Raya to release him on bail and freed him from pre-trial detention. His charges were not dropped. The court prohibited him from posting any political posts on his Facebook or travel abroad.Prime Minister Hun Sen gave a speech when inaugurating a cement factory in Kampot on November 14 during which he announced the release of 72 political prisoners; however, their criminal charges were not dropped.Long PuthearaLong Putheara, 17On September 7, 2020, police arrested rapper Long Putheara at his house in Phnom Penh.On September 9, the authorities charged him with incitement to commit a felony (articles 494 and 495 of Cambodia’s penal code) and sent him to pre-trial detention at Siem Reap provincial prison.On December 22, the Phnom Penh court convicted him and sentenced him to 5 months in prison, of which he must spend 3 months and 11 days in prison with the remainder suspended. His release was scheduled for the same day as his conviction.The complaints against him filed by the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts. Putheara apologized to the ministry during his trial for releasing a song on social issues.Putheara collaborated with the rapper Kea Sokun, who was arrested on September 4 and charged with incitement because of lyrics in Sokun’s music that critically address social issues in Cambodia.Soung Neak PoanSoung Neak Poan, 29On July 10, 2019, in commemoration of the third anniversary since the killing of prominent political commentator Kem Ley, student activist Soung Neak Poan distributed posters calling for an end to extrajudicial killings. Police arrested Soung Neak Poan as well as two other youth activist twin brothers, Chum Hout and Chum Hour, who had carried a flower wreath to place near the station where Ley was killed. At the Phnom Penh police station, Soung Neak Poan refused to sign a “confession” to refrain from similar activities in the future – a requirement that Cambodian authorities frequently impose on released activists – and thus police held Neak Poan overnight. The two twin brothers were released upon signing the confession. On July 12, Soung Neak Poan was charged with incitement to commit a felony and sent to pretrial detention at Phnom Penh’s Correctional Center 1 (CC1). On August 13, 2019, the Phnom Penh court denied Neak Poan bail.After Prime Minister Hun Sen’s speech inaugurating a cement factory in Kampot on November 14 during which he announced the release of 72 political prisoners, Neak Poan was released on bail on November 15.

At the same time, authorities also arrested Sun Bunthon, who had been the former CNRP commune council member of Baray commune.The authorities alleged he had shared information on Facebook that insulted Prime Minister Hun Sen and promoted information about the planned return of acting CNRP head, Sam Rainsy, to Cambodia.The authorities justified conducting the arrest without an arrest warrant on the grounds that he was caught committing the act (“in flagrante delicto”), a justification commonly used by Cambodian authorities to shortcut judicial protections against arbitrary arrest. The authorities alleged that the information the two had shared on Facebook would cause public harm or constitute a threat of a crime about to be committed.After arrest, the authorities held Phoeun overnight at Kampong Thom police station. On September 2, the Kampong Thom provincial court charged him with defamation, “public insult,” “incitement to commit felony,” and “discrediting a judicial decision” (respectively, articles 305, 307, 494, 495, and 523 of the Cambodian criminal code) as well as continuing to be active on behalf of a political party that had been dissolved by the Supreme Court, an allegation that is based on the repressive amendments of the Law on Political Parties (new article 42).

The judge indefinitely postponed the reading of his verdict because he was “busy.” On November 1, the court sentenced him to eight months in prison.He served four months and 15 days in prison, with the remainder of the sentence suspended. Sovann Chhay was released from prison on November 10, 2021. For the next two years, he will be required to appear before the court whenever summoned; inform the court if he changes his address; and obtain permission to leave the country, among other conditions.In their handling of the case, the authorities have not taken into account that Sovann Chhay is a person with a disability or that he is a child, being under age 18. According to the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Cambodia ratified, the authorities have a duty to make "reasonable accommodations" for persons with disabilities when interrogated by the police, held in police custody and pre-trial detention or prison. At trial, Sovann Chhay’s defense lawyer requested twice that Sovann Chhay's disability and support needs be evaluated, however, the court refused both those requests. The prosecution had argued that Sovann Chhay no longer had a disability. Human Rights Watch received reports that no accommodations were made for Sovann Chhay, either during police custody and questioning or in prison.Before his arrest, an unidentified person contacted him on the mobile Telegram app, asking Sovann Chhay who he was, calling his father a traitor and telling Sovann Chhay that he will be jailed too.This was not the first time Sovann Chhay has been targeted. On October 4, 2020, police had arrested Sovann Chhay and detained him overnight at the police station after he had climbed into the CNRP’s abandoned former headquarters in Phnom Penh to collect flags for his room. The authorities released him two days later after a "confession" was extracted in which he apologized for "causing mischief." Then on April 27, two men attacked Sovann Chhay while he was driving his motorbike, leaving him seriously injured after being hit with a brick. The injury was severe enough that he had to go to the hospital for treatment of a fractured skull. The police never found the two assailants.UN human rights experts expressed that they were “deeply disturbed” by the detention of Sovann Chhay, calling for his release.Chum PuthyClick to expand ImageChum PuthyOn August 4, 2020, police arrested Chum Puthy, a CNRP, a former member of the Svay Rieng provincial executive committee of the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP).

The letter stated the entire editing process of the documentary was done in Russia by Russia Today staff, and not by Mony, who was simply a consultant.These statements contradict the allegations made on June 12 by the trial judge of the municipal court, which indicated that Mony had been involved in the production of the documentary.On March 25, 2019, the investigating judge announced the closure of his judicial investigation and sent the case to trial. On May 30, the Phnom Penh municipal court held the first trial hearing. After three hours, which focused on Rath Rott Mony’s relationship with Moscow’s RT news service and his exact role in the production of “My Mother Sold Me,” the judge postponed the hearing until June 12, citing the absence of the two plaintiffs listed in the complaint, Tep Salin and her daughter Lim Sreyty, who is featured in the documentary. Mony repeated that he was merely providing translations and had no input in the content of the documentary. Mony’s lawyers had objected because they were denied an opportunity to question the plaintiff. On June 12, the two plaintiffs, Tep Salin and Lim Sreyty appeared in court, accusing Mony of promising to help them set up a hairdresser salon and laundry business in Phnom Penh in return for their testimony in the documentary. Changing their story – the mother never sold her daughter – they sought US$10,000 in damages from Mony.On June 26, the court convicted Mony of “incitement to discriminate” (article 496 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) and sentenced him to two years in prison, and imposed a 70 million Cambodian riel (US$17,500) compensation payment that Mony must pay to the two plaintiffs. The verdict was delivered rapidly, in approximately 10 minutes in a courtroom filled with journalists, diplomats, and UN and NGO staffers.In July 2020, the Supreme Court ordered Mony’s retrial, finding that the Appeal Court’s decision in December 2019 to uphold his conviction was “incorrect.”On December 11, 2020, the authorities released him upon completion of his two-year prison sentence. While released, his case remains open pending the judicial appeals process.Chhun SithiChhun SithiSentenced: 1 yearChhun Sithi, a CNRP commune councilor in Stung Kach commune, Pailin province, was arrested on October 24, 2017, a day after he posted a video clip on social media with a message to Prime Minister Hun Sen stating that he would not defect to the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) even if the main opposition party, the CNRP, was dissolved or he was stripped of his position.

Subsequently he stated that he was involved in a traffic stop of a car loaded with 172 kilograms of marijuana traveling from Preah Vihear province.

The case was reopened in mid-July 2018, when national military police spokesman Brigadier General Eng Hy called on the Anti-Corruption Unit to investigate who received the US$300,000 in 2013, with the justification that other military officials may have been involved. He also alleged that Sam Neang had been taken to court several times in the past for other criminal offenses. Provincial military police commander Hang Thol alleged without basis that Sam Neang had “seized more than 100 kilograms of marijuana [… and after] seizing it, he hid the marijuana and did not report the matter hoping to extort money from the traffickers.” He stated that Sam Neang was “punished” later.In 2017, the military dismissed Sam Neang from service, allegedly because of his repeated critical Facebook posts about the military, including documents on the drug case and the disappearance of 90 pieces of luxury rosewood confiscated from an arrested truck driver.

The 13-second video went viral on social media. Sokha fled to Thailand after government called for her arrest. She received refugee status from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). On January 25, 2018, the Kampong Speu Provincial Court convicted her in absentia of insulting a public official and incitement to discriminate (articles 494, 496 and 502 of the Criminal Code) and sentenced her to two years in prison and a fine of 5 million riels (US$1,250).Despite her protected status as a refugee, Thai authorities arrested her and, over UNHCR and diplomatic objections, forcibly returned her to Cambodia on February 8, 2018. On February 9, Cambodian officials transferred her to Kampong Speu provincial prison to start serving her sentence. Sokha filed a motion to seek a retrial in which she would be present, basing her argument on the provisions of article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Kampong Speu provincial court heard her motion on March 15, 2018, and upheld her conviction and prison sentence. She appealed that decision and on May 7, 2019, the Phnom Penh Appeals Court held a hearing in which Sokha and her lawyers were present to argue their case. On May 31, the court of appeal upheld the verdict.In the meantime, in relation to comments Sokha made on Facebook during the time she sought refuge in Bangkok, a Phnom Penh prosecutor pursued additional charges of incitement to discriminate and public insult under articles 307, 494 and 496 of the Criminal Code. The charges arose in connection with a Kampong Speu provincial police commissariat report alleging Sokha had insulted Prime Minister Hun Sen and his wife, Bun Rany. The Kampong Speu provincial court heard the case on December 6, 2018. On January 9, 2019, the court sentenced her to an additional two years in prison, accompanied by a fine of 5 million riel (US$1,250). She appealed this decision, and the Phnom Penh appeal court scheduled a hearing for May 6. However, for some unexplained reason, prison officials failed to transport Sokha to court, leading the judge to postpone her hearing. On May 31, the hearing took place with Sokha and her lawyers present. On June 21, the Phnom Penh appellate court upheld the verdict.On February 10, 2022, the authorities released her from prison, after she served four years in prison. She paid also a fine of US$2,500 upon being released.DECEASED IN CUSTODYTith RornTith Rorn, 37Tith Rorn was an opposition CNRP activist and the son of former CNRP official Eam Tith. He was arrested on April 15, 2019, related to a 13-year-old assault charge, even though the statute of limitations had expired. He died on April 18, 2019, after less than 72 hours in police custody. Visible bruises on his body suggest he was beaten.Cambodian authorities claim Tith Rorn fell in the bathroom of his jail cell due to “being addicted to alcohol,” but they failed to conduct an independent, thorough, and impartial investigation into the cause of death. His father stated that when “my son left home prior to his arrest, there were no bruises or injuries on him, and he wasn’t suffering from any illness.”Activists and Tith Rorn’s family were dismissive of obviously edited video footage publicized by the Phnom Penh Post that was received from Kampong Cham provincial police headquarters. They are demanding a prompt, thorough, and independent investigation into his death.Som BophaSom Bopha, 39On October 30, 2019, Som Bopha, a Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) activist in Svay Rieng province, died after falling from a police officer’s motorbike on her way to the police station after officers arrested her. She had publicly voiced support of the announced return of acting CNRP leader, Sam Rainsy.In mid-October, local officials pressured her father-in-law, Hun Yoap, a former elected CNRP commune councilor in Tnaot commune in Kampong Ro district, Svay Rieng province, to defect to the ruling Cambodian People’s Party. He was later listed as one of the 50 former CNRP members who surrendered to the authorities to avoid charges of plotting a coup (article 454 of Cambodia’s criminal code). After Bopha and her husband had an argument, Hun Yoap had filed a domestic abuse complaint against her with the police. Authorities cited the complaint as the reason they arrived at the house to arrest her, but they did not have an arrest warrant.More than a dozen police officers arrived at her house to arrest her. Bopha told them she was not feeling well. Family members proposed to the police to drive her instead with their car to the police station, but the arresting officers refused. The police arrived in an SUV and seven motorbikes. A video posted on Facebook shows her unconscious after the fall off the motorbike.Tuoy SrosTuoy SrosOn December 28, 2019, more than 30 Banteay Meanchey [gendarmerie police] cracked down on a land protest in front of the Banteay Meanchey provincial hall, upon orders of Col. Sar Bunsoeung, the Banteay Meanchey deputy provincial military police chief. They arrested the land rights activist, Tuoy Sros, and four other protesters – Nov Noeun, Yip Mok, Him Kiri and An Ruon. The authorities held the five men in a cell at the Banteay Meanchey headquarters of the gendarmerie that is commonly used to detain drug users. Upon arrest and thereafter in detention , the provincial gendarmerie officers allegedly beat and kicked the five men, inflicting serious injuries.On December 31, the prosecutor of the Banteay Meanchey provincial court charged all five men with intentional acts of violence on a private property (articles 248 and 253 of Cambodia’s 2001 Land Law), and sent them to pre-trial detention at Banteay Meanchey prison.On January 1, 2020, due to his deteriorating medical condition, authorities transported Sros from jail to the Japan-Cambodia Friendship Hospital in Banteay Meanchey province. On the way to the hospital, Sros died.On January 2, authorities also transferred Nov Noeun, Him Kiri and An Ruon, to the same hospital for medical examination. The three men filed a complaint against the Banteay Meanchey military police about the ill-treatment while in custody.On January 3, authorities granted the four detained protesters release on bail. While the prison released Yip Mok on January 3, the hospital discharged the three men on January 5. The authorities did not drop the charges against the four protesters.On January 14, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that an investigation was to be conducted and that all officials should be held accountable for the ill-treatment against the protesters, including Sros’ death. Hun Sen instructed Sao Sokha, the National Military Police Commander, to establish an investigative committee because “the person who caused injury must be punished without any tolerance.”On January 18, authorities arrested two military police officials, Col. Sar Bunsoeung, and First Lt. Chhoy Rathana, an officer working with the provincial anti-drug office, based on charges of “intentional violence and aggravating circumstances” (articles 218 and 224 of Cambodia’s Criminal Code) after they confessed to being “negligent in their duty.” Both men are currently in pre-trial detention at Banteay Meanchey provincial prison.According to An Ruon, one of the protesters, “Sar Bunsoeung hit the victim [Sros] and pointed a pistol at his temple, threatening to kill him, saying, ‘I took 11 bodies out of this place, do you want to be the 12th?’” On January 1, authorities claimed that Sros had suffered from alcoholism withdrawal, while also denying that they had inflicted any ill-treatment on the detainees, despite physical evidence to the contrary. Sros’ wife, Buy Kimlak, denied that her husband was an alcoholic or had any health issues. When she last visited her husband in prison on December 31, she noticed he was very weak and barely conscious due to the injuries he had suffered.An Ruon also said that Sros had been handcuffed and kicked in the ribs “until he screamed for mercy.” He said that Sros had “screamed all through the night, and they [the police] finally took him to another place, but they [the police] kept beating him until he lost his memory.” Him Kiri, one of the protesters, added that police had ordered drug addicts held in the same cell to beat Sros.RFA reported that authorities had donated 10 million Cambodian riels (US$2,500) to Sros’ wife for funeral expenses and financial support for her children’s school fees.Region / CountryAsia CambodiaTopicFree SpeechProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet Updates On Rights Issues From Around The GlobeSign UpConnect With UsTwitterFacebookYouTubeInstagramFooter menuContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsBlackbaud Security IncidentSite MapChild Safeguarding© 2022 Human Rights WatchHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700Human Rights Watchis a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808Human Rights Watch
