Human Rights Watch's investigations into Kudaev's case found that he was severely beaten soon after his arrest to confess to crimes."If the Pentagon relied on forced confessions for the evidence to prove recidivism, then its conclusions are pretty questionable," said Carroll Bogert, associate director of Human Rights Watch. "Terrorism is a label that is widely abused by many of the governments who have taken back their citizens from Guantanamo."Kudaev is one of seven Russian citizens whom the US government picked up in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001 and sent to Guantanamo. They were returned to Russia in 2004 despite their fears of being tortured and ill-treated back home. Human Rights Watch detailed their harassment and mistreatment by Russian authorities in a 2007 report, "The Stamp of Guantanamo."Human Rights Watch interviewed Kudaev's mother, lawyer, and others familiar with the case in 2006. His mother and others say that Kudaev was at home during the Nalchik uprising and that injuries he sustained while being arrested in Afghanistan, which worsened in detention at Guantanamo, made it impossible for him to leave the house, much less participate in armed conflict."The detainees begged not to be returned to Russia because they knew they would be tortured there," said Bogert. "Kudaev's case doesn't prove that ex-Guantanamo detainees are likely to return to terrorism. It proves that they should not be sent home to countries that routinely use torture."Another Russian former Guantanamo detainee, Ruslan Odizhev, was shot dead in 2007 in what local police claimed was an exchange of small-arms fire in Nalchik. His mother told Human Rights Watch in 2006 that he had been repeatedly and brutally tortured by security officials before he left Russia for Afghanistan, and that after his return from Guantanamo, he disappeared at least partly to avoid further mistreatment.Another Russian former Guantanamo detainee has received political asylum in the Netherlands and is living quietly there. In all, more than 40 former detainees, most of them European citizens or residents, are now living in Europe. None is known to have engaged in militant or other violent activity.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryEurope/Central Asia United States Russia US Foreign PolicyTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism Torture GuantanamoMore ReadingDecember 2, 2008News ReleaseRussia: Ex-Guantanamo Detainee Seriously Ill in JailMarch 28, 2007News ReleaseUS Sent Guantanamo Detainees Home to Torture in RussiaReportsFebruary 5, 2020ReportDeported to DangerUnited States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and AbuseSeptember 17, 2018Report“We Live in Constant Fear”Possession of Extremist Material in KyrgyzstanMore ReadingDecember 2, 2008News ReleaseRussia: Ex-Guantanamo Detainee Seriously Ill in JailMarch 28, 2007News ReleaseUS Sent Guantanamo Detainees Home to Torture in RussiaMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
