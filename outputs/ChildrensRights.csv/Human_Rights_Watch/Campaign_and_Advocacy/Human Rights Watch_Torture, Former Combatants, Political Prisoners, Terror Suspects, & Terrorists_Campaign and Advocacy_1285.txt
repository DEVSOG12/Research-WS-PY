Suspects were held in prolonged incommunicado detention, and faced other violations of their right to due process and a fair trial.“Detainees are on a fast-track to conviction because prosecutors and judges show little interest in how the police obtained their statements,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch’s executive director for the Middle East and North Africa Division. “Their treatment shows that the human rights advances in Morocco have largely bypassed the courts.”The 70-page report, “Human Rights at a Crossroads,” features interviews with the lawyers and family members of Moroccan prisoners who said that their interrogators had subjected them to physical and mental abuse, in some cases amounting to torture, in order to extract confessions or to induce them to sign a statement they had not made. Many were held incommunicado by police beyond the legal time limit and did not have prompt access to defense counsel.Human Rights Watch said that Morocco’s counter-terror legislation, passed quickly in the wake of the Casablanca bombings, erodes rights protections. For example, the legislation extends to 12 days the time police can hold a terror suspect before he is brought before a judge, and to 10 days the time he can be held before consulting a lawyer. The legislation further introduces a sweeping definition of “terrorism” offenses, for which stiffer penalties are applicable.“The problems in Morocco run deeper than any one piece of legislation,” said Whitson. “Even the recent reforms to the criminal justice system have not alleviated the systemic failures to protect rights.”Human Rights Watch said that Moroccan courts should fulfill their role as a bulwark against abuse by rejecting evidence that is tainted by torture, improper coercion, or other serious violations of due process, and by holding the perpetrators of such abuse accountable.The report also examines one of the positive human rights developments in Morocco, the establishment of a commission to document and provide compensation for grave abuses that the state perpetrated against dissidents and others under the rule of the king’s father, Hassan II. The report describes the Equity and Reconciliation Commission as the Arab world’s most serious effort yet to acknowledge and address past abuses, but expresses concern about limitations on the commission’s mandate and powers. The report offers recommendations to help the commission address past abuses in a fashion that contributes more effectively to ending impunity.Human Rights Watch urges the United States and the European Union to integrate respect for human rights in their growing security cooperation with Morocco. The recommendations also include a call for assistance in reforming the Moroccan criminal justice system while pressing the government of Morocco to make judicial independence a reality. The report also urges the United States and European countries not to extradite or otherwise forcibly return to Morocco persons suspected of terrorist offenses unless the government provides verifiable guarantees that such persons will not be subject to torture or other ill-treatment.“The suicide bombings of May 2003 were despicable attacks on innocent civilians,” said Whitson. “But unless authorities fight extremist violence in a way that is consistent with their public commitment to human rights, the rights of all Moroccans are at risk.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa Morocco/Western SaharaTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism TortureMore ReadingJuly 7, 2004News ReleaseMorocco: Bush Should Criticize Backsliding on RightsAugust 10, 2004News ReleaseU.N.: Counterterrorism Body Neglects Human RightsReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 7, 2021Report“Security Forces Dealt with Them”Suspicious Killings and Extrajudicial Executions by Egyptian Security ForcesMore ReadingJuly 7, 2004News ReleaseMorocco: Bush Should Criticize Backsliding on RightsAugust 10, 2004News ReleaseU.N.: Counterterrorism Body Neglects Human RightsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
