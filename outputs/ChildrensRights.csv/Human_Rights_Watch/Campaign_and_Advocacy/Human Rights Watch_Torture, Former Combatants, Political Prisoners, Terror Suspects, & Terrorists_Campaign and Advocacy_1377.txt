Security officers barred Tran Thi Nga’s husband and children from the court, along with supporters and independent journalists.Vietnam has long used vague national security laws to punish critics and stifle dissent. Yet recently the government’s response has grown increasingly severe, with extreme prison sentences and tighter online restrictions.Tran Thi Nga, also known as Thuy Nga, was arrested in January for sharing articles and videos online highlighting ongoing rights abuses tied to environmental crises and political corruption. According to state media, she was indicted for “defaming the administration” and “spreading reactionary ideas.”On the internet, Tran Thi Nga – an outspoken critic of police brutality, land grabbing, and labor abuses – had connected with a far-reaching community of like-minded activists and supporters. Her conviction comes one month after blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, or “Mother Mushroom,” was sentenced to 10 years in prison under the same penal code offense, article 88. As social media fosters a growing pro-democracy forum in Vietnam, the government has ramped up its crackdown on online activity, blocking Facebook during large-scale protests and pressuring multinationals to back censorship.Click to expand ImageTran Thi Nga after being assaulted in Hanoi on May 25, 2014.© 2014 Private/Dan Lam BaoFor a decade, Tran Thi Nga has carried out her fight against injustice despite government intimidation and assault. In August 2015, she was dragged from a bus and beaten by plainclothes police after visiting a recently released political prisoner. A May 2014 targeted attack by five men on the street in Hanoi left her with a broken arm and leg. Yet she was unyielding, continuing to speak out against the assaults and broader state violence.Tran Thi Nga and Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, both prominent figures within activist networks, campaigned regularly for political prisoners throughout the country. Over 100 are currently imprisoned for exercising their basic freedoms.The two women’s sentences serve as retribution for their independence, leadership, and solidarity. But as a threat to other rights defenders, they seem unlikely to have the intended silencing effect. A February petition calling for Tran Thi Nga’s release, signed by about 900 activists, states: “The arrest of Nga will not intimidate people with conscience and bravery.… This will make the democratic and human rights movement stronger.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia VietnamTagsLand RightsTopicFree Speech Technology and RightsMore ReadingJuly 23, 2017News ReleaseVietnam: New Threats to Growing Online CommunityJune 28, 2017News ReleaseVietnam: Free Blogger ‘Mother Mushroom’ReportsJune 18, 2017ReportNo Country for Human Rights ActivistsAssaults on Bloggers and Democracy Campaigners in VietnamJune 22, 2015ReportAt Your Own RiskReprisals against Critics of World Bank Group ProjectsMore ReadingJuly 23, 2017News ReleaseVietnam: New Threats to Growing Online CommunityJune 28, 2017News ReleaseVietnam: Free Blogger ‘Mother Mushroom’Most ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
