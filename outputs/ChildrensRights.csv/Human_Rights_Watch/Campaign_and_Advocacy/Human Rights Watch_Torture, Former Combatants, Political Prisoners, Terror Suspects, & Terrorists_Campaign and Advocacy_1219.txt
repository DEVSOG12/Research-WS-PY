The government has not released any information about the detention."The videotape of this episode shocked the world," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "The report of the arrest was reassuring, but now the government needs to make the details public. Secretive prosecutions will not deter further abuses and torture."The videotape of the attack, aired on ABC News on April 22, 2009, showed the sheik torturing the grain dealer with whips, electric cattle prods, and a wooden plank with protruding nails. It has set off international condemnation.The United Arab Emirates announced on April 29 that the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department would conduct an expeditious and "comprehensive review" of the torture incident. The announcement followed a letter from Human Rights Watch to the UAE president on April 28 urging the government to take action. Previously, the Ministry of Interior had characterized the abuse as an assault that the parties subsequently settled "privately."Human Rights Watch reiterated its call to the UAE government to establish an independent body with authority to inquire more broadly into the prevalence of abuse and torture by UAE police. The UAE government should also ratify the Convention against Torture and publicly and unequivocally renounce the use of torture and physical abuse by the police, others in positions of authority, or private citizens, Human Rights Watch said.Despite international coverage of the incident, media in the UAE have been reluctant to report on it, highlighting the need for the government to revise its draft media law and, among other changes, remove Article 32, which provides a fine of up to 5,000,000 dirhams (US$1,350,000) against anyone who "disparages" senior government personnel or members of the royal family.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa United Arab EmiratesTopicTorture Free SpeechMore ReadingApril 28, 2009News ReleaseUAE: Prosecute Torture by Royal Family MemberApril 28, 2009LetterLetter to the UAE on the Torture of Mohammed Shah PoorReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsJuly 28, 2022Report“They’ll Get You No Matter What”Morocco’s Playbook to Crush DissentMore ReadingApril 28, 2009News ReleaseUAE: Prosecute Torture by Royal Family MemberApril 28, 2009LetterLetter to the UAE on the Torture of Mohammed Shah PoorMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
