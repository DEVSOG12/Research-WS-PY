The chambers were inaugurated by Senegal and the African Union in February 2013 to prosecute the “person or persons” most responsible for international crimes committed in Chad between 1982 and 1990, the period when Habre ruled Chad. The president of the Trial Chamber is Gberdao Gustave Kam of Burkina Faso, who will sit with two senior Senegalese judges, Amady Diouf and Moustapha Ba, and Pape Ousmane Diallo of Senegal as an alternate.The judges were inaugurated on April 23, and Senegal’s minister of justice Sidiki Kaba said that the trial would begin in June.Habré’s trial will be the first in the world in which the courts of one country prosecute the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes. It will also be the first universal jurisdiction case to proceed to trial in Africa. Universal jurisdiction is a legal basis in international law that allows national courts to prosecute the most serious crimes even when committed abroad, by a foreigner and against foreign victims.The question-and-answer document includes information about the history of the case and details about the trial and the Extraordinary African Chambers.Habré is accused of thousands of political killings and systematic torture during his rule, from 1982 to 1990, when he was deposed by the current president, Idriss Déby Itno, and fled to Senegal. After a 22-year campaign by his victims, the chambers indicted Habré in July 2013 for crimes against humanity, torture, and war crimes and placed him in pretrial custody. After a 19-month investigation, judges of the Extraordinary African Chambers found that there was sufficient evidence for Habre to face trial.On March 25, 2015, a court in Chad convicted 20 top security agents of Habré’s government on torture and murder charges.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAfrica Chad SenegalTagsThe Trial of Hissène Habré Hissène HabréTopicInternational Justice TortureRelated content2015_Senegal_Chad_Habré_case_Q&A_2.pdfMore ReadingMay 27, 2022News ReleaseChad: No Reparations for Ex-President’s VictimsAugust 24, 2021DispatchesFormer Chad Dictator Habré’s Dead, Victims Still Await CompensationReportsJune 28, 2016ReportEnabling a DictatorThe United States and Chad’s Hissène Habré 1982-1990January 26, 2007ReportThe Trial of Hissène HabréTime is Running Out for the VictimsMore ReadingMay 27, 2022News ReleaseChad: No Reparations for Ex-President’s VictimsAugust 24, 2021DispatchesFormer Chad Dictator Habré’s Dead, Victims Still Await CompensationMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
