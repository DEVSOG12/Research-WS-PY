Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, formerly the top U.S. commander in Iraq, and Gen. Geoffrey Miller, the former commander of the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cubaincasesofcrimesagainstdetainees. It rejected last week’s report by the Army Inspector General which was said to absolve Gen. Sanchez of responsibility.“General Sanchez gave the troops at Abu Ghraib the green light to use dogs to terrorize detainees, and they did, and we know what happened, said Brody.“And while mayhem went on under his nose for three months, Sanchez didn’t step in to halt it.”HumanRightsWatchalsoexpressedconcernthat,despiteallthedamagethathadbeendonebythedetaineeabusescandal,theUnitedStateshadnotstoppedtheuseofillegalcoerciveinterrogation.InJanuary2005,AttorneyGeneralAlbertoGonzalesclaimedinawrittenresponseduringhisconfirmationhearingsthattheprohibitiononcruel,inhuman,ordegrading(CID)treatmentdoesnotapplytoU.S.personnelinthetreatmentofnon-citizensabroad,indicatingthatnolawwouldprohibittheCIAfromengaginginCIDtreatmentwhenitinterrogatesnon-AmericansoutsidetheUnitedStates.Human
