In particular, the authorities have targeted Muslims who practice their faith outside state-controlled religious institutions.Human Rights Watch documented the recent wave of repression in two letters to Uzbek President Islam Karimov that were made public today. The Uzbek government has yet to reply to the concerns raised in the letters, which were sent on August 18, 2004.“The fight against terrorism doesn’t give the government free reign to violate human rights,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “The state can’t simply dispense with core human rights even if it has legitimate security concerns.”The first letter documents new cases of arbitrary detention, harassment and ill-treatment of Muslim dissidents. A wave of arrests followed explosions directed against police officers in Tashkent and Bukhara in late March and early April. While the government blamed the attacks on “extremists,” its response has broadly targeted “independent Muslims,” who practice their faith outside government-controlled mosques and other religious institutions. The letter also sets out concrete recommendations for tackling government abuses.The second letter details violations of fair trial standards in a recent Supreme Court trial of 15 defendants on terrorism, murder and other charges relating to the March-April violence. On August 24, all 15 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to 18 years. The letter calls on the government to respect due process and fair trial standards in future trials. Uzbekistan lacks an independent judiciary.“Uzbekistan has a terrible track record when it comes to trying terrorism cases,” Denber said. “Unfair trials rob the judicial process of legitimacy, which only undermines the Uzbek government’s struggle against terrorism.”The start of two new terrorism trials in Tashkent and Bukhara on Tuesday, September 7, has given the need for fair trials a particular urgency. In Tashkent, seven men and eight women are being tried in the Akmal-Ikramov district court on multiple charges, including terrorism, murder, inciting religious hatred, fundamentalism, violating freedom of conscience and undermining the constitutional order. Allegations that some of the defendants were illegally detained and denied access to counsel raised questions about the fairness of the proceedings even before the trial began.In Bukhara, the 16 male defendants on trial in the city’s Province Court face multiple charges including terrorism and murder. All 16 reportedly confessed on the first day of the trial. Rukhiddin Komilov, a lawyer representing the defendant Fazliddin Tukhtaev, has been excluded from the proceedings because authorities claimed that he is not the attorney of record, even though he has a copy of the order appointing him to represent Tukhtaev. The authorities have also prevented Komilov from taking part in the investigation and reviewing the case materials.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryEurope/Central Asia UzbekistanTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism Torture Detention without Trial Religious FreedomMore ReadingAugust 17, 2004LetterUzbekistan: Terrorism Trials Should be FairJuly 13, 2004News ReleaseUzbekistan: U.S. Cuts Aid Over Rights ConcernsReportsNovember 3, 2021ReportDismantling DetentionInternational Alternatives to Detaining ImmigrantsSeptember 17, 2018Report“We Live in Constant Fear”Possession of Extremist Material in KyrgyzstanMore ReadingAugust 17, 2004LetterUzbekistan: Terrorism Trials Should be FairJuly 13, 2004News ReleaseUzbekistan: U.S. Cuts Aid Over Rights ConcernsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
