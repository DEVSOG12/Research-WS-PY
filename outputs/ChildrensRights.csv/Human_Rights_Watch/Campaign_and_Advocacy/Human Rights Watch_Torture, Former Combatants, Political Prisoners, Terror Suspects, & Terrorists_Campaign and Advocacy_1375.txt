Human Rights Watch posted a new web page highlighting the cases of 15 of more than 100 people imprisoned for political or religious reasons.International leaders and trade partners attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Da Nang on November 10, 2017, should call on Vietnamese authorities to end the government’s systematic persecution of peaceful critics and ensure the basic rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, and religion for its citizens.“While doing photo-ops and trade deals with the leaders of Vietnam’s one-party state, foreign officials in the country for APEC should not turn a blind eye to the over 100 political prisoners those very same leaders have put behind bars,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “At the same time that Vietnam is playing the role of a friendly host to welcome international delegations, the authorities are intensifying their crackdown on anyone with the courage to speak up for human rights and democracy.”More than 100 political prisoners are currently locked up simply for exercising their basic rights.&#13;Special FeatureSince its formation in 1976, the modern, unified Vietnamese state has imprisoned people for the exercise of basic freedoms. At present, at least 105 peaceful critics (list below) are in prison for expressing critical views of the government, taking part in peaceful protests, participating in religious groups that don’t have the authorities’ approval, or joining civil or political organizations that the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam deem threats to its monopoly on power.On October 25, in the most recent sentencing, the People’s Court of Thai Nguyen sentenced 24-year-old student blogger Phan Kim Khanh to six years in prison for “conducting propaganda against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” Upon release, he will serve an additional four years of probation restricting his movement to his residential ward. The verdict should be quashed and Phan Kim Khanh should be immediately released, Human Rights Watch said.Neither a glittering APEC summit nor new trade deals can cover up the ugly reality that Vietnam still runs a police state that brooks no dissent.Brad AdamsAsia DirectorWithin the past 12 months, the police have arrested at least 28 people for sweeping “national security” offenses that are used to punish critical speech. The most recent arrest was on October 17, when the police detained an environmental activist, Tran Thi Xuan, in Ha Tinh province and charged her with activities aimed at overthrowing the government.Vietnamese rights bloggers and activists face police harassment, intimidation, intrusive surveillance, detention, and interrogation on a daily basis. Many are denounced on state media and national television, and others are subjected to public criticism in their neighborhoods. Police frequently prohibit rights campaigners from leaving the country or place them under temporary house arrest to prevent them from joining a protest or meeting with foreign diplomats. Activists have faced increasing numbers of beatings and assaults by men in civilian clothes operating under the protection of the authorities. Vietnamese activists who are arrested are often placed in lengthy police detention before their trial, without access to legal assistance or family visits.“Neither a glittering APEC summit nor new trade deals can cover up the ugly reality that Vietnam still runs a police state that brooks no dissent,” Adams said. “Any leader of a democracy who goes to APEC but doesn’t take up the cause of Vietnam’s political prisoners should be ashamed at missing the opportunity to do the right thing on a global stage. International donors and trade partners should press Vietnam for systemic change to a more democratic system that respects human rights and the rule of law.”Human Rights Watch List of Political PrisonersOctober 2017The following is a list of people imprisoned in Vietnam for expressing critical views of the government, taking part in peaceful protests, participating in religious groups not approved by the authorities, or joining civil or political organizations that the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam deems threats to its monopoly on power. This list only includes people who have been convicted and remain in prison and does not include the significant number of detainees who have been arrested, are currently facing trial, and have not yet been convicted. It is also almost certainly incomplete, as it only includes convictions that Human Rights Watch has been able to document.Due to difficulties in obtaining information about convictions and sentences in Vietnam, this list may differ from those compiled by other organizations, and such differences do not necessarily reflect inaccuracies. Vietnam should be urged to open its legal system – including case files and proceedings – to public scrutiny.Phan Kim Khánh, born 1993Nguyễn Văn Oai, born 1981Trần Thị Nga, born 1977Nguyễn Ngọc Như Quỳnh (also known as Mẹ Nấm), born 1979Rơ Ma Đaih (Ama Pôn) born 1989Puih Bop (Ama Phun), born 1959Ksor Kam (Ama H’Trưm), born 1965Rơ Lan Kly (Ama Blan), born 1962Đinh Nông (Bă Pol), born 1965Trần Anh Kim, born 1949Lê Thanh Tùng, born 1968Cấn Thị Thêu, born 1962Ksor Phit, born 1970Siu Đik, born 1970Nguyễn Hữu Quốc Duy, born 1985Ksor Púp (Ama Hyung)Siu Đoang, born 1983A Jen, born 1984A Tik, born 1952Đinh Kữ, born 1972Thin, born 1979Gyưn, born 1980Nguyễn Đình Ngọc (also known as Nguyễn Ngọc Già), born 1966Ngô Thị Minh Ước, born 1959Nguyễn Hữu Vinh (also known as Ba Sàm), born 1956Nguyễn Tiến ThịnhHoàng Văn ThuNguyễn Lê Châu BìnhNguyễn Văn Thông, born 1965Kpuih KhuôngRmah KhilRmah BloanhA Kuin (also known as Bă Chăn), born 1974Ngư (also known as Bă Săn), born 1972Điểu B’ré (also known as Bạp Bum), born 1969Điểu By Ơ, born 1967Đinh Yum, born 1963Rơ Mah Plă (also known as Rmah Blă; a.k.a Ama Em), born 1968Siu Tinh (also known as Ama Khâm), born 1978RưnChiĐinh LýĐinh NgoThạch Thươl, born 1985Ngô Hào, born 1948A Tách (also known as Bă Hlôl), born 1959Rung, born 1979Jơnh (also known as Chình), born 1952A Hyum (also known as Bă Kôl), born 1940Byưk, born 1945Đinh Lứ, born 1976Đinh Hrôn, born 1981Đinh Nguyên Kha, born 1988Phan Văn Thu, born 1948Lê Duy Lộc, born 1956Vương Tấn Sơn, born 1953Đoàn Đình Nam, born 1951Nguyễn Kỳ Lạc, born 1951Tạ Khu, born 1947Từ Thiện Lương, born 1950Võ Ngọc Cư, born 1951Võ Thành Lê, born 1955Võ Tiết, born 1952Lê Phúc, born 1951Đoàn Văn Cư, born 1962Nguyễn Dinh, born 1968Phan Thanh Ý, born 1948Đỗ Thị Hồng, born 1957Trần Phi Dũng, born 1966Lê Đức Động, born 1983Lê Trọng Cư, born 1966Lương Nhật Quang, born 1987Nguyễn Thái Bình, born 1986Trần Quân, born 1984Phan Thanh Tường, born 1987Hồ Đức Hòa, born 1974Nguyễn Đặng Minh Mẫn, born 1985Tráng A Chớ, born 1985Kpuil MelKpuil LễSiu Thái (also known as Ama Thương), born 1978Phạm Thị Phượng, born 1945Trần Thị Thúy, born 1971Siu Hlom, born 1967Siu Nheo, born 1955Siu Brơm, born 1967Rah Lan Mlih, born 1966Rơ Mah Pró, born 1964Rah Lan Blom, born 1976Kpă Sinh, born 1959Rơ Mah Klít, born 1946Nguyễn Hoàng Quốc Hùng, born 1981Trần Huỳnh Duy Thức, born 1966Rmah Hlach (also known as Ama Blut), born 1968Siu Kơch (also known as Ama Liên), born 1985Nhi (also known as Bă Tiêm), born 1958Siu Ben (also known as Ama Yôn)Rơ Lan Jú (also known as Ama Suit)Nơh, born 1959Rôh, born 1962Pinh, born 1967Siu WiuBrong, born 1964Y Kur BĐápY Jim ÊbanYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia VietnamTopicFree Speech Technology and Rights Press Freedom Religious FreedomMore ReadingOctober 24, 2017News ReleaseVietnam: Drop Charge Against Student ActivistReportsApril 14, 2022Report“I Could Have Been Next”Stymied Reforms in the MaldivesFebruary 17, 2022Report“Locked Inside Our Home”Movement Restrictions on Rights Activists in VietnamMore ReadingOctober 24, 2017News ReleaseVietnam: Drop Charge Against Student ActivistMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
