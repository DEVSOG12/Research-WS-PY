He said the summary trial was held behind closed doors and that she was denied access to a lawyer. On January 19, authorities transferred Mohammadi, who has been detained since November 2021, to Qarchak prison south of Tehran after she spent 64 days in solitary confinement in Evin prison.“Iranian authorities’ cruel detention and prosecution of Narges Mohammadi only one year after she was released from an earlier prison term and then piling on more unfair prison sentences are clearly intended to crush her into silence at all costs,” said Tara Sepehri Far, senior Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Narges Mohammadi, who has already unjustly been imprisoned for years.”Iranian authorities arrested Mohammadi in Karaj while she was attending a memorial service for Ebrahim Ketabdar, one of the hundreds of people killed during widespread protests in November 2019. The authorities proceeded to transfer her to the 209 ward of Evin prison which is under the supervision of Iran’s Intelligence Ministry. In May 2021, Mohammadi announced that she had been sentenced to 30 months in prison and 80 lashes for “propaganda against the political system … [and] slander and rebellion against the prison administration” relating to allegations against her that led to her filing of a complaint against prison authorities during her previous imprisonment.In a letter published by the Defender of Human Rights Center on January 27, Mohammadi said that the prosecutor informed her of the new accusations on November 22 and she was taken to the prosecutor’s office on December 24 and informed that she would be formally charged. In the letter, Mohammadi said that she requested access to a lawyer in the session, but that the prosecutor denied her request.Rahmani told Human Rights Watch that he understood that on January 12, in a trial that lasted no longer than five minutes, the judge insulted Mohammadi, and specifically mentioned Mohammadi’s recent nomination by two Norwegian parliament members for the Nobel peace prize and her efforts to shed light on the systematic use of prolonged solitary confinement against political prisoners as acts intending to tarnish the reputation of the system. Mohammadi did not have access to a lawyer during the trial.Mohammadi’s letter said that her nomination has been included in the verdict as evidence for her conviction. The sentence also included a two-year ban on membership in political parties and “activities in social and digital platforms” as well as a two-year internal exile in Iran.Mohammadi had been sentenced to 10 years in prison in May 2015 for “establishing an illegal group,” “assembly and collusion to act against national security,” and “propaganda against the state.” Authorities arrested Mohammadi after her meeting with Catherine Ashton, then the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in Tehran. During her imprisonment in Tehran’s Evin Prison, she filed a complaint against prison authorities for physical abuse.Mohammadi, who suffers from a serious neurological disease that causes muscular paralysis, was released from prison in October 2020 after her sentence was reduced but was denied a passport, which effectively barred her from uniting with her family in France. After her release, she and a group of other political prisoners filed a complaint against authorities concerning the prevalent use of solitary confinement against political prisoners.“People like Narges Mohammadi are the ones who work to bring Iranian civil society together,” Sepehri Far said. “Governments that are engaging diplomatically with Iran should make sure to press the government to stop its relentless crackdown against human rights defenders.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa IranMore ReadingJanuary 18, 2022BlogIranian Authorities Send Iranian-French Researcher Back to PrisonJanuary 13, 2022News ReleaseIran: No End to Mounting RepressionReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 8, 2022Report“It Was Really Hard to Protect Myself”Impact of the Armed Conflict in Syria on Children with DisabilitiesMore ReadingJanuary 18, 2022BlogIranian Authorities Send Iranian-French Researcher Back to PrisonJanuary 13, 2022News ReleaseIran: No End to Mounting RepressionMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
