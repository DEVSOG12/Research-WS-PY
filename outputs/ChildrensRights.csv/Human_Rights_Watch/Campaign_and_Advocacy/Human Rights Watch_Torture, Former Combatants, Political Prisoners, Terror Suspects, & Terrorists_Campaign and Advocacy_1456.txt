On Friday morning, he was found dead in his cell, allegedly by hanging.Garaev is survived by his wife, Sona Ballyeva, and three young children. Ms. Ballyeva dismissed the government's allegation that Garaev committed suicide. She reported to Human Rights Watch that when she visited Garaev in June, "he was used to being in solitary confinement. . . . [H]e was in good health, physical and mental. He cheered me up, saying he would fall under the golden amnesty declared by the president of Turkmenistan, and that the whole family would greet the New Year together. Moreover, my relatives received a letter from him on September 6, saying he was alive and well, that everything was fine, and that he was hoping to be out by December.""The circumstances surrounding Garaev's death are extremely suspicious," stated Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. "The Turkmen government has a poor track record with the truth, and from the beginning fabricated outrageous charges against Garaev. So we have no reason to believe its version of Garaev's death."Garaev was linked with former Turkmen vice-president Avdy Kuliev, an archrival to President Saparmurad Niyazov, who currently lives in exile. In 1994, Turkmen security forces arrested Garaev, a Russian citizen, in Uzbekistan. He was brought to Turkmenistan without the formality of an extradition procedure. In 1995, a Turkmen court sentenced him, together with Mukhammetkuli Aimuradov, to twelve and fifteen years, respectively, in a maximum-security labor colony on trumped-up charges of "planning the violent overthrow of the constitutional order of Turkmenistan...and the armed seizure of power." During the investigation Turkmen authorities reportedly severely mistreated Garaev and Aimuradov and prevented them from contacting their lawyers, or from examining evidence or question witnesses against them.In November 1998, the Turkmen government launched new charges against Garaev and Aimuradov, including conspiracy to assassinate the president. The new charges allegedly stemmed from an incident in prison officials falsely told Garaev that his young son had died, causing Garaev to attack the prison guards in a rage. After an international outcry underscored the absurdity of the assassination charges, a court sentenced Garaev to ten additional years on charges of attempted escape."Garaev was political prisoner — he should never have been in prison in the first place," Ms. Cartner continued. "Turkmenistan employs no other way of dealing with dissent other than jailing dissenters."Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryEurope/Central Asia TurkmenistanMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022DispatchesRussia Uses Facial Recognition to Hunt Down Draft EvadersOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsReportsSeptember 21, 2022Report“It’s As If They’re Poisoning Us”The Health Impacts of Plastic Recycling in TurkeySeptember 1, 2022Report“We Had No Choice”“Filtration” and the Crime of Forcibly Transferring Ukrainian Civilians to RussiaMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022DispatchesRussia Uses Facial Recognition to Hunt Down Draft EvadersOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
