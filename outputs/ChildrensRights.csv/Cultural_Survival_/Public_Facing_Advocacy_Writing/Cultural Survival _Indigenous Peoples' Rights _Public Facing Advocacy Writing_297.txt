Changing Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day is a step towards disrupting these oppressive systems and shifts focus to recognize, honor, and celebrate Indigenous Peoples, knowledge, histories, cultures, traditions, and lands. It is an opportunity to learn about the Peoples whose land we occupy and now call home and to take action in supporting the rights and sovereignty of all Indigenous Peoples.1.

The year 2020 represents 400 years since colonizers voyaged on the Mayflower and founded Plymouth Colony as settlers on Native land. This anniversary is a time of reckoning with that history of violence, dispossession, removal.Indigenous Peoples DayIRR Producers Shaldon Ferris (Khoisan) and Avexnim Cojti (Maya K'iche') uncover the history of Indigenous resistance to colonization and the "discovery" narrative that perpetuates the celebration of Columbus and the erasure of Indigenous Peoples.5. Indigenize your music playlistJoin us in celebrating #IndigenousPeoplesDay by listening to some great Native musicians.
