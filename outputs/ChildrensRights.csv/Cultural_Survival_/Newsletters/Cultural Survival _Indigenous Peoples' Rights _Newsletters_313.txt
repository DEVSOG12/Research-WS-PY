All are mountain dwellers living on the fringes of forests they once called home. They and their families were forcefully displaced without compensation. Yet, these communities have strong economic, cultural, and spiritual connections to those lands, which have not been fully granted by the protected area management regimes.Living in Two Worlds in Sápmi: Jannie StaffanssonJannie Staffansson (Saami) is a renowned Indigenous climate change expert. She lives in Jokkmokk, Sápmi, in the north of Sweden, where she works with her partner and her beloved reindeer.A Bridge Between Worlds in Siberia: Tatyana Vassilievna KobezhikovaFor centuries, our ancestors have known how to forecast the weather, predict future harvests, and cure diseases with natural medicines. In our traditional belief systems, the world is inhabited by spirits: the water spirit, the fire spirit, animal spirits, and ancestral spirits. Mother Nature is at the core of our values and belief systems. People feel an overwhelming reverence and respect for these divine powers and carry responsibilities towards these spirits.Balancing Motherhood and Service: Maricela Zurita CruzMaricela Zurita Cruz (ChatNya) hails from San Juan Quiahije, Oaxaca, Mexico. She graduated high school with a scholarship for Indigenous women granted by the Guadalupe Musalem Fund. At the end of her studies, she began to collaborate with Grupo de Estudios sobre la Mujer Rosario Castellanos (GES Mujer), one of Mexico’s oldest women’s rights organizations, which works to improve gender equity and women’s well being through outreach, research, communications, and training in Oaxaca.Head Up, Pencil Down, No Longer Invisible: Being Queer and Indigenous in AcademiaBoozhoo-aaniin, my name is Lindsey Balidoy. I am Bad River Ojibwe and Tiwa Pueblo. I am a scholar and an educator. I am a proud queer woman. I am a daughter, sister, friend, and relative. I am also someone who felt like all of these identities did not belong in the same place at the same time. That is, until I found a community of Indigenous scholars who refused to be invisibilized, teaching me what it means to decolonize my identity through academia.The Radical Healing Power of Indigenous LoveMy mother was a revolutionary. She lived her life authentically, expressing exactly who she was and exactly how she felt—even in moments that society deemed “inappropriate.” And that meant she felt everything as powerfully as the fire that burned inside of her, and she loved as fearlessly as the words that fell from her tongue every day. She was a living, breathing example of all the mothers and grandmothers who have upheld Indigenous insurgence, claiming a place for themselves in systems that were seeking to terminate them.45-1 Indigenous Women: The Strength of Our CommunitiesMarch 2021Read on IssuuBuy a copySubscribeDepartmentsRights in Action#LandBack in South Africa: The Fight for Table MountainExecutive Director's MessageIndigenous Women are Cornerstones of Our CommunitiesBazaar ArtistUsing Art to Inspire: Eva Vasquez ClementeIndigenous KnowledgePlay Ball, Maya Style: Interview with Enrique SalanicEnvironmental DefendersDefending the Sacred in South Texas: Christa ManciasYouth Fellow SpotlightIpiak Slendy Montanhuano UshiguaGrant Partner SpotlightOMIECH: Traditional Maya Midwives Protecting Women’s HealthIndigenous ArtsHere We Are: Reclaiming Indigenous Identity in America2067 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA 02140(617) 441-5400Cultural Survival, Inc. is a non-profit organization with federal 501(c)(3) status.
