The statistical measures of the language crisis are staggering. Scholarly calculations project 90 percent of the globe’s almost 6,800 languages are on a course to fall silent during the lifetime of the children that are now being born into the world. UNESCO has estimated that, on average, a language is being lost every two weeks.Learning to Relate Through Indigenous Science EducationOn a cool, overcast afternoon in late spring, a small group of First Nations, Métis, and non-Indigenous university students work together to erect a mîkiwahp (Plains Cree for tipi) on a plot of land an hour north of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. For most of the students it is their first time setting up a mîkiwahp, but with the guidance of Barry Ahenakew, a nêhiyaw (Plains Cree) knowledge keeper, the students soon have it ready to provide shelter from the coming rain.Battling the Nicaragua CanalThis article contains excerpts from an investigative documentary radio program produced by Cultural Survival Indigenous Rights Radio Producer, Rosy Gonzalez.A Cow Is Life: THE POKOT-TURKANA CONFLICTI was raised in a nomadic pastoralist community; I know firsthand the importance of owning a cow. My parents always reminded me that ‘a cow is life.’ The older I got, the more I started to witness the truth of that advice. In a pastoralist community, cattle are a source of food, pride, prestige, wealth, and status. Men with big herds of cattle hold leadership positions and young men cannot marry unless they have accumulated enough cattle for dowry. In the pastoralist communities, a cow is the source of life and also the cause of death.At a Crossroads: Seeking Justice for Indigenous Human Rights and Environmental Defenders in BelizeOn the outskirts of Santa Cruz village in the Toledo district of Belize stands a small shack on top of a lush green hill. The structure itself is unassuming, barely visible from the southern highway below. Thick forest partially obscures it from view and adds to its perceived insignificance. The average passerby would not think twice about this tiny house, but to the villagers of Santa Cruz it towers like a skyscraper, casting an ominous shadow over their community.CSQ 40-2 Our Cultures, Our Lands, Our RightsPurchase your issue here! http://shop.culturalsurvival.org/products/csq-40-2-our-cultures-our-lands-our-rights40-2 Our Cultures, Our Lands, Our RightsJune 2016Read on IssuuBuy a copySubscribeDepartmentsTake ActionMaximizing the Convention on the Elimination of Racial DiscriminationRights in ActionRural Women’s Right to Free, Prior and Informed ConsentBazaar ArtistLand is the Basis of our Lives: Gina BrooksBoard SpotlightImproving the quality of life of Native communities by promoting core tribal values: Jason CampbellRights in ActionChevron Corp. v.
