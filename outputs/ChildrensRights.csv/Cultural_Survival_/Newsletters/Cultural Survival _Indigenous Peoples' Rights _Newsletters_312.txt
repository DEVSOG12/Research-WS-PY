That’s what my mom used to lovingly tell me when I was being rambunctious as a child. Tsuk wik’a is a Yowlumne phrase meaning be quiet, or shut up. To be fair, I was quite the chatterbox, and honestly, that hasn’t changed much. When my mom first told me tsuk wik’a, I asked her where she learned that phrase, and she told me it was an Indian word that she learned from her dad. He would tell her the same thing as a child. Growing up, it was mentioned within my family that we were Native American, or Indian.The Volcanic Force of María Mercedes CoroyThe scene is set: February 10, 2015.

Coroy greets the audience shyly, but bravely, first in Spanish and then in her native Mayan Kaqchikel language.Sparking the Creative Essence of Youth in South AfricaSouth Africa has been branded as “the Rainbow Nation” because of the diversity of its citizens.

What is becoming more and more apparent lately is the exclusion of the Khoi and San languages, especially from school curricula, radio, and television. Under Apartheid, only English and Afrikaans were official languages. This famously led to the Soweto uprising ofThe Radical Act of BeingMia Beverly (she/they), 22, is a member of the Sandhill Band of Cherokee and Lenape and currently works as a grant writer and manager for the First Foods Program, an Indigenous-led nonprofit based in New York that was created in March of 2020.
