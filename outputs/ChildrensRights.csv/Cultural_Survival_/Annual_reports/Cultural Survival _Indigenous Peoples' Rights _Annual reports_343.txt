Cultural     Survival
ANNUAL REPORT 2009
mong the world’s remote Indigenous communities, the Indigenous Peoples of
Didipio in the Philippines are an inspiration for their courageous struggle to ensuretheir own and their environment’s survival. Didipio’s original Bugkalot Indigenous
residents hunted and gathered in the densely forested mountains; now they and a num-ber of other Indigenous Peoples from the mountain region have been forced out of theirhomelands and have settled in the Didipio Valley. There they collectively manage theirforest resources in a sustainable way. Pure and abundant water tumbles down forestedmountains into the Addalam River, nourishing fertile valleys, making the Didipio Valleyperfect for terraced rice farming. But since 1992, these peoples’ way of life has beenthreatened by mining companies. Staunch Indigenous opposition sent several companiespacking, but the Australian Philippines Mining Company, a subsidiary of OceanaGoldPhilippines Inc (OGPI), has refused to let go of its concession on Mount Dinkidi, and is
now planning to mine neighboring mountains as well. 
Open pit copper and gold mines like that planned by OGPI use huge quantities of water
as well as cyanide and other dangerous chemicals to separate copper and gold fromore. On Mount Dinkidi, mining waste would be dumped into tailings ponds at the top ofthe Addalam River watershed—ponds that would submerge scarce and highly valuedproductive farm land. Managing mine waste in a region prone to torrential rains andtyphoons creates the risk of fish kills, crop failures, and illness in humans and animals.If the pond dams rupture, toxic chemicals, soil, and rock could plunge down the valley,affecting ecosystems and communities for hundreds of miles downstream. 
For the past two decades, determined to protect their water supply, their homes, their
cultures, and their sustainable economy, Didipio’s Indigenous Peoples have resisted themining companies’ bribes and intimidation and instead exercised their constitutionalrights to oppose mines. In return, the Philippine government posted a permanent mili-tary guard to Didipio—not to protect local people, but to make it easier for OGPI tothreaten them, forcibly evict them, and demolish their houses. A climate of violence,fear, discord, and grief now dominates daily life.
Fortunately, the Indigenous Peoples in Didipio have not had to face OGPI alone. Global
Response, a nongovernmental organization based in Boulder, Colorado, has been attheir side, generating letters and publicity to convince the government of thePhilippines to protect their rights and stop the mine. Global Response organizes broadand effective campaigns requested by Indigenous Peoples to protect their ways of lifeand their environments. They boast an experienced campaign staff, an expert team ofenvironmental advisors, and two decades of cultivated relationships with Indigenouscommunities facing exploitation, unwanted interference, or abuse from governmentsand companies that want their resources—at any cost. All of those qualities convincedCultural Survival to take the bold step of merging with Global Response in September2009. As a program of Cultural Survival, Global Response can focus more of its energieson helping more Indigenous communities, and both organizations increase their reachand their effectiveness.

2Adding Global Response advocacy campaigns to our core programs was not the only thing that made 2009 a
banner year for Cultural Survival. Our Endangered Native American Languages Program hosted a LanguageSummit at the National Museum of the American Indian in May, attended by more than 200 Native languageadvocates. Part of the summit was a day devoted to lobbying, the culmination of a long congressional edu-cation effort, with participants visiting congressional offices and appealing for more governmental supportof language programs. That effort paid off when Congress voted to quadruple this year’s federal funding forNative language revitalization, from around $3 million to nearly $12 million! 
Our Guatemala Radio Program—soon to become the Indigenous Community Radio Program—is going interna-
tional. Program director Mark Camp is spending this year in Guatemala almost doubling the number of sta-tions there and laying the groundwork for expanding the network into neighboring countries.   
Our efforts in partnership with the Ngöbe people of Panama paid off this summer when the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights demanded that Panama halt all work on the Changuinola hydroelectric damthat threatens their homes, farmlands, water supply, and way of life. Unfortunately, the fight continues asPanama and the subsidiary of the Virginia-based energy giant AES Corporation that is building the dam, havedefiantly announced they will not comply. Instead, they are trying to manipulate individual Ngöbe and theircommunities into giving up their homelands with no compensation for the abuse they already suffered, andno guarantee of suitable replacement lands. Cultural Survival lawyers are working closely with the Ngöbe toensure that they understand and claim their rights in those negotiations. As this report went to press, welearned that the case has been handed up to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which has the powerto order a halt to the building.
If you haven’t visited our website lately, you are in for a treat. It’s brand new and richer than ever in con-
tent. Please check it out, and return often. It will keep you abreast of all of our work, contains every arti-cle we’ve ever published in the Cultural Survival Quarterly, and has a map showing the many and varied
activities we have undertaken on behalf of Indigenous Peoples around the world over our 38-year history. 
Lastly, I want to thank all of you who make Cultural Survival’s work possible: board members, Program
Council members, advisors, staff, volunteers, members, donors, libraries, foundations, and shoppers at ourCultural Survival Bazaars. You are our lifeblood. You make sure that in the great rush towards globalizationand development, Indigenous Peoples, their cultures, their traditional knowledge, spirituality, and ways oflife, and the environments in which they live are not totally overlooked. We are enormously honored to beworthy of your support.

ANNUAL REPORT 20093CULTURAL SURVIVAL“I see this kind of merger as the
future for many nonprofits. It willmake a world of difference forthe peoples that both organizationsserve while making donors’dollars go further. The combinedCultural Survival and GlobalResponse memberships canbecome an even more powerfulforce for change that benefitsIndigenous Peoples and theenvironment.”
— Roy Young,
founder of Global Response
On May 27, more than 2,000
Indigenous protesters started a blockade of the road between BaguaGrande and Corral Auemado in Peru.Photo by Thomas Quirynen.When Cultural Survival and Global Response
merged in September, Global Response became aprogram within Cultural Survival, but the pro-grammatic partnership functionally started muchearlier, in May. That’s when the two organizationsjoined forces to launch an international letter-writing campaign to halt police and militaryassaults on Indigenous Peoples of the PeruvianAmazon. For months, the Indigenous people hadbeen protesting a series of presidential decreesthat would have opened their territories to min-ing, logging, and oil development without theirconsent. Our international pressure helped con-vince the Peruvian government to repeal two ofthe decrees immediately and initiate furthernegotiations with the Indigenous Peoples andtheir representative organizations. Indigenouscommunities continue to demand the right tofree, prior and informed consent for industrialprojects within their territories.  
Amazonian tribes in Ecuador face similar inva-
sions of their territories, devastation of theirenvironment, and police repression of theirprotests. A Global Response campaign in Octobersupported their demands.  
Another letter-writing campaign urged the presi-
dent of Guatemala to support legislation to legal-ize and regulate Indigenous community radio sta-tions—an action that is critical to the success ofCultural Survival’s Guatemala Radio Program.  
The two major Global Response campaigns since
the merger seek to halt large-scale mining proj-ects in the Philippines and Indonesia, whereIndigenous communities face brutal forced dis-placement, destruction of their agricultural landsand crops, contamination of their rivers andcoastal waters, health problems and police bru-
tality as they struggle to defend their rights andtheir lands. In the Philippines, our campaignhelped convince the Philippines’ NationalCommission on Human Rights to visit the Didipiocommunity for the first time (their report andrecommendations are pending).  
Because so many Indigenous communities face
invasions by mining companies, and because theconsequences are so destructive, Global Responsepublished a 45-page guide that lays out strategiesfor communities to repel or expel mining compa-nies from their lands. Spanish and English editionsof the guide are posted on the Cultural Survivalwebsite and available on request by mail oremail. Communities on every continent areeagerly ordering and using the guide. 
As 2009 closed, Global Response embarked on its
most ambitious program yet. Program directorPaula Palmer and human rights expert Chris Allantraveled to Kenya to investigate reports of policeatrocities and attacks on many Samburu commu-nities. They spent two weeks interviewingIndigenous people in five communities, as well aspoliticians, nonprofit organizations, clergy, andothers involved in the situation. They foundample evidence of gross human rights violationsand crimes by the police, including murder, rape,and wholesale theft. Their full report is now onthe Cultural Survival website at www.cs.org/sam-burureport. Copies of the report were also deliv-ered to the United Nations, the president andattorney general of Kenya, and news agenciesaround the world. As of this writing, the violencehas largely stopped, and Samburu people creditCultural Survival’s investigation as the reason.

ANNUAL REPORT 2009The Ngöbe people living along the Changuinola
River in Panama have been facing the destructionof their villages, farms, food supply, access toclean water, and way of life as a result of the gov-ernment of Panama’s decision to build a hydro-electric dam on their river. The government con-tracted with AES-Changuinola, a subsidiary of theVirginia-based energy giant AES Corporation, tonot only build the dam but also manage the relo-cation of the Ngöbe people whose homelands will
be flooded. Following a series of protests that thegovernment brutally put down, and after exhaustingall domestic remedies, in March 2008 CulturalSurvival and Panamanian partners filed a petition onthe Ngöbe’s behalf in the Inter-AmericanCommission on Human Rights. This past summer, thecommission demanded that Panama cease all workon the dam until the matter was resolved.
Instead, the government stepped up construction.
Both the previous government and the newMartinelli government informed the commission thatthey had no intention of halting construction, andindeed each time the commission calls for an updateor holds a hearing, AES-Changuinola steps up theconstruction pace. All of the Ngöbe are adamant thatconstruction must stop until the case is resolved, buttheir demands are ignored.
In a new tactic, the government is now hand picking
individual Ngöbe to transport to Panama City to dis-cuss a settlement. In an initial accord signed by eightindividuals from three affected communities, two ofwhich have already been virtually destroyed by damconstruction, neither the government nor the com-pany offered any compensation for more than threeyears of trespass, suffering, and abuse. They didoffer relocation, but without any timeline, toremote hillside terrain that is prone to landslides andoffers poor opportunities for establishing new farms.  Another group of Ngöbe has begun conversations
with the government and AES-Changuinola inPanama City. This time, Cultural Survival hired askilled Panamanian lawyer with experience in inter-national human rights law to represent the Ngöbeparticipants. But even in setting up these meetings,the government violated the Ngöbe peoples' humanrights. Both the United Nations Declaration on theRights of Indigenous Peoples and the Inter-AmericanCourt of Human Rights require that negotiations takeplace in Indigenous communities, and in the localIndigenous language, so that all community mem-bers can participate. 
The government and AES-Changuinola's insistence on
negotiations now appear to be a cynical attempt tocomplete dam construction before they are blockedby international interference. It is no accident thatthe talks are occurring on the eve of Panama's dryseason, when sculpting the rest of the dam's lakebedis easiest from a construction point of view. That theearlier accord reached with a handful of individualswas conducted in the capital in complete secrecy,that they were signed by them without any enforce-able commitment to protect the way or life or well-being of the Ngöbe communities they claim to speakfor, and that they did not include any offer thosecommunities compensation for the harm and suffer-ing they already experienced, suggests the nefari-ousness of the government's and the company'sintentions in achieving their hydroelectric powergoals unfettered by their obligations to Panama'sIndigenous citizens.
7STOPPING THE CHANGUINOLA DAM IN PANAMAFrancisco Xico, a Mayan priest
who volunteers at his local stationsays, "The radio helps keep ourculture and language alive." AsCultural Survival staffer AncelmoXunic says, "It is by the communi-ty, for the community." Communityradio volunteer Angelica CuburSul says, "As an Indigenouswoman, community radio is theonly place that I can express myviews and opinions and be surethat they will be heard by the entiretown. The Mayor expresses hisopinion on our radio, so do thepolice, and so do I." 
CULTURAL SURVIVALOn June 27th, a copy of the proposed
telecommunications bill, which wouldlegalize community radio in Guatemala,was personally delivered to PresidentAlvaro Colom Caballeros by radio volun-teers in Palestina de los AltosQuetzaltenango. The President was visitingthe community to inaugurate a social pro-gram "Mi Familia Progresa." Villagers heldsigns saying "My family progresses withcommunity radio and it is my right." Citizensurged the President to support the bill andpromote its passage through Congress. Nonprofit community radio plays a critical role in
the daily lives of hundreds of thousands ofIndigenous people in Guatemala, and the peopleplay a critical role in the stations. The stationsdepend heavily on volunteers who operate stationsin their own villages and keep them on the air six-teen hours a day, seven days a week. They volun-teer their time, usually two hours a day, and arethe lifeblood of community radio. It is throughthese volunteers and the programs that theybroadcast that one million Guatemalans receiveinformation. That’s why we put so much of oureffort into helping them. In 2009, Cultural Survivaltrained 326 community radio volunteers who will,in turn become trainers themselves in their vil-lages. One volunteer, Germán Xet, told us that,"The workshop helped me do a better job when I'mon the air at the radio station, which will help allthe listeners in my town." Demonstrating the suc-cess of our train-the-trainers model, seven of thetrainers who taught workshops this year are grad-uates of Cultural Survival trainings from 2007 and2008.
Cultural Survival's Guatemalan radio pro-
duction staff created a total of 286 radio programsduring the year, encompassing a wide range oftopics including Indigenous rights, environmentalprotection, sustainable agriculture, fair trade,health, and political participation. Programs wererecorded in Spanish, Mam, Kaqchikel, K'iche, Achi,Poqomam, and Tz'utujil. All of these programswere made in cooperation with local doctors, nurs-es, human rights workers, environmentalists,farmers and other experts. The production,
recording, and editing of the radio programs is alldone at local stations. All programs are madeavailable via CD, email attachment, or on theCultural Survival website to our network of 168radio stations. Each radio station is independentlyowned and operated by the local community,which decides which programs they will broadcast.
Despite guarantees made in the
Guatemalan Constitution and the Peace Accords,the Guatemalan telecommunications law does notallow for nonprofit community radio (only com-mercial radio and government-run radio arelicensed). Community members know that theyhave a right to community radio, and they knowthat their communities need the radio stations.They are determined to continue to exercise theirright and remain on the air even though they facethe constant threat of being closed down by thegovernment. At the end of 2008, Cultural Survivalgot the government to restart stalled nationalroundtable discussions. The roundtable resulted ina bill was that was introduced into the GuatemalanCongress in August 2009. This bill, which wouldgrant FM frequencies to nonprofit community radiostations, received a positive recommendation froma Congressional Committee on January 14, 2010.The next step is for the bill to be debated by thefull Congress. Hundreds of citizens from dozens ofcommunities where, only 13 years ago, civil warraged are now engaged in participatory democracyas they lobby their congressional representativesto pass the bill into law.

Revitalization Campaign built a national networkof nearly 1,500 Native American language teach-ers, learners, and advocates. With a tiny cam-paign staff we've established national collabora-tions to bolster and showcase successful Nativelanguage programs, including renowned languageimmersion projects in Alaska, Arizona, California,Hawai‘i, Massachusetts, Montana, New York,North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. Duringthe coming year our campaign will focus on link-ing hundreds of communities through an onlinenetwork, www.languagegathering.org—currentlyunder construction—to be housed as a subplat-form of the Cultural Survival website. Thisurgently needed resource will facilitate sharing ofcurriculum frameworks, instructional materials,and fund-raising resources for isolated programsstruggling to quickly design, fund, and implementlanguage programs while they still have livingspeakers in their communities. With a Decemberaward from the Bay and Paul Foundation weanticipate making our beta (test) site operationalby the end of June. 
In the past year we've also co-hosted
national language summits in Seattle, Milwaukee,and Washington, D.C. In partnership with theLibrary of Congress and the SmithsonianInstitution's National Anthropological Archives andthe National Museum of the American Indian, wehosted fundraising and archival-materials trainingsessions for nearly 300 representatives from trib-al language programs. We also brought tworevered elder statesmen—World War II NativeAmerican Code Talkers Barney Old Coyote (Crow)and Samuel Tso (Navajo)—to Washington to meetwith Congressional appropriators regarding fund-ing for language immersion programs, and toinspire today's generation of frontline languageadvocates.  In addition, we continue to support, pro-
mote, and receive invaluable guidance from fourcritically endangered language communities: theEuchee, Northern Arapaho, Sauk, andWampanoag, whose circumstances are emblemat-ic of those facing all 175 remaining Native lan-guage communities over the next 20 years.  Thisyear, Cultural Survival raised nearly a quarter of amillion dollars in federal funding for the Saukmaster-apprentice program. We also sought thesame funding amount for the Northern Arapahoimmersion school, and hope to submit a success-ful proposal in 2010. We have provided fiscalsponsorship and/or significant funding researchfor all four programs.  
At the national level, we are especially
proud that in substantial part due to our cam-paign work with the National Alliance to SaveNative Languages and the National IndianEducation Association, the U.S. House and Senateappropriations committees and President Obamahave quadrupled the federal dollars targeted forNative language programs in the 2010 U.S. feder-al budget. Finally, we have joined the NationalIndian Education Association's Native LanguagesWhite House Advisory Group, which met with theObama Administration in February on a proposedexecutive order to improve federal programs aid-ing grassroots Native language revitalization ini-tiatives.

Cultural Survival Hosts Crude . 
On November 13, 2009 at the Museum ofFine Arts in Boston, Cultural co-hostedthe screening of Crude, a documentary
film that explores an oil disaster inEcuador. For decades, first Texaco andthen Chevron Oil have desecratedIndigenous Peoples' homelands inEcuador, rendering the water, the soil,and the very air hostile to human life,killing wildlife, fouling watersheds, andwreaking devastation that will affectgenerations to come. Facing unprece-dented rates of birth defects, rare can-cers, and other serious health problems,and losing their traditional lands andlifestyles, these Indigenous communitiesare being forced to fight a transnational
corporation for their very right to exist

a David-and-Goliath story brilliantly
captured by the fiilmmakers. The filmwas followed by a Q&A with the film'sproducer, Michael Bonfiglio, and TedMacdonald, former Cultural Survivalstaffer who worked on this case and wasan eyewitness to many of the events inthe film.Cultural Survival Hosts Media Conference: 
In a typical year, the number of news storiesabout Indigenous Peoples that appear in the New
York Times and National Public Radio news
programs represents less than 1 percent of all thestories they produce. And the vast majority ofthose few Indigenous stories deal with NativeAmericans, ignoring all the other IndigenousPeoples in the world. Cultural Survival has set outto change that equation and took the first step onMarch 12, 2009, when Cultural Survival staffconvened a panel of media experts at the OpenSociety Institute in New York. The meeting wasintended to explore the nature of the problemand to look for strategies that might increasecoverage and understanding of Indigenous issues.The participants included both Indigenous andnon-Indigenous media representatives andcovered both traditional and new media. Therewere experts on film (Sundance Institute,Makepeace Productions), television (CNN,TimeWarner), print and new media (SeattleTimes, Free Range Studios, Red Hand Media,WITNESS), and many others. It was only the firstof what will likely be a series of meetings toaddress the problem, but even in this initialmeeting there were many innovative andconstructive ideas presented.Cultural Survival at the United Nations
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues: During the eighth session of the United NationsPermanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in NewYork, May 18-29, 2009, Cultural Survival hostedtwo special events. “Exercising Rights—GoodPractice” was a session on the implementation ofthe UN Declaration on the Rights of IndigenousPeoples, cosponsored with Lancaster University.“Broadcasting Human Rights to IndigenousCommunities” was a session on the use ofcommunity radio in promoting human rightsinformation, cosponsored with Foundation forAboriginal and Islander Research Action AustralianIndigenous Communications Association.

Cesar Gomez was the lead presenter in thesession focused on community radio. Cesar talkedabout the Guatemala Radio Project and alsoshowed a newly completed documentary about itto the many who attended, including Guatemalangovernment representatives. The breakoutsession's panel, which also included Kenneth Deerand Cultural Survival board member Les Malezer,was very well received. 
OTHER CULTURAL SURVIVAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS
ANNUAL REPORT 200913CULTURAL SURVIVAL
ANNUAL REPORT 200915The past year saw some dramatic changes in
Cultural Survival’s communications efforts. Wehired the top nonprofit web consultants in theUnited States to rework the Cultural Survivalwebsite, which launched in October with newcontent, new organization, and a new platform.We also hired an outreach consultant, and with hishelp we have increased the number of visitors tothe Cultural Survival website to more than 1.6million.  
Cultural Survival’s e-newsletter now
reaches more than 18,000 people each month (upfrom 12,000 at the start of the year) with updateson the organization’s programs and campaigns. 
Cultural Survival Quarterly magazine has
also grown, doubling its circulation in 2009 andcontinuing to hone the quality of the informationand images. It remains the world’s premierpublication about Indigenous Peoples. During theyear we established partnerships with many fairtrade companies, environmental groups, and otherbusinesses and organizations to distribute themagazine and introduce new audiences to theissues that Indigenous Peoples face. And onceagain this year, Cultural Survival Quarterly was
nominated for an Utne Reader independent pressaward. 
The summer issue of the magazine was a
special edition, focused on the Indigenous Peoplesof Brazil’s Cerrado, the savanna region of thecountry. The Cerrado’s Native Peoples are facing
immense threats from rampant agriculturalexpansion and very ambitious i nfrastructure
development. We are preparing a specialPortuguese-language version of that issue as anadvocacy tool for the region’s Indigenous activists, tohelp them reclaim their land and defend their rights. 
Cultural Survival’s merger with Global
Response has had many benefits for bothorganizations and, of course, for Indigenouscommunities around the world. The combinedstrength of the organizations allows CulturalSurvival to mount more campaigns and producemore effective campaign materials, all of whichmeans more communities can fend off mines,logging, dams, and other environmental andcultural threats.
COMMUNICATIONS
MEMBERSHIP
Cultural Survival's members continued to be the organization's greatest single source of support, pro-viding more than half of our annual income. This year, 726 new members joined Cultural Survival.Sixty-three of these members signed up at Cultural Survival Bazaars. As in past years, our memberscome from many countries and a vast variety of backgrounds, but they share a passion for the rightsof Indigenous Peoples. The Cultural Survival bazaars are a series of cultur-
al festivals that give Indigenous artists, their repre-sentatives, and fair trade companies from aroundthe world the chance to sell their work directly tothe American public. They also expose more than35,000 Americans each year to Indigenous art,music, and culture, while giving visitors a chance totalk with Indigenous artists directly. Every year,hundreds of artists and their representatives selltraditional crafts, artwork, clothing, jewelry, car-pets, and accessories from around the world.
Cultural Survival hosted eight bazaars in
2009. We had twelve special guest artisans travel-ing from Zanzibar, Zimbabwe, and Mexico. During2009, bazaars grossed over $430,000. Proceeds sup-ported Indigenous artisans, fair trade companies,and other nonprofit organizations throughout theworld, as well as Cultural Survival's other programwork. CULTURAL SURVIVAL BAZAARS
“Cultural Survival has done so much not
only for us as artists, but for theIndigenous people of the world. AsNative Americans, we have seen somany organizations  who say that theydo good work. Cultural Survival actual-ly does it! The bazaars give us a greatvenue to not only sell our artwork, butalso to talk to the public and educatethem about our culture. Gifts from thebazaars come from hands and heartsinstead of from malls and catalogs.”

spring 2009INTERN PROGRAM
Cultural Survival's work could not be accomplished without
our interns. Interns are involved in all areas of the organi-zation's work and play a vital role in day-to-day operationsat Cultural Survival. This year we hosted 27 interns fromuniversities around the country.
Guatemala Radio Project: Interns assisted in eval-
uating all the radio program episodes, helped write quar-terly reports and grant applications,and  set up speakingengagements about the project for station representatives.
Endangered Languages :  Interns helped organ-
ize materials for hundreds of Native American languageadvocates attending the National Native LanguageRevitalization Summit. Interns also assisted withfundraising, helping research foundations and developdonor files for potential funders for Native Americanlanguage programs.  Interns and graduate volunteersalso helped organize outreach calls and interviews withdozens of tribal language programs across the U.S.Fundraising and Events : Interns contributed to
the success of our expanded bazaars program by edu-cating the public about Indigenous issues and fair trade,setting up and breaking down the bazaars, maintainingsecurity, encouraging attendees to join CulturalSurvival, assisting vendors and performers, selling rugsand crafts, handing out flyers, and directing traffic.Fundraising interns also conducted research and helpedwrite grant proposals and reports to donors.
Publications and Research: Interns wrote or
contributed to articles that were published in theCultural Survival Quarterly and wrote features and
urgent appeals for the website. Cultural Survival is governed by a board of directors that serves as the organization's legal accountability mechanism and
bears all the responsibilities of boards of directors in the United States and in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Theboard works through committees, including an Executive Committee, a Finance Committee, a Fundraising Committee, anda Nominating Committee.
A unique feature of our board is our Program Council, a committee predominantly made up of Indigenous board members
who possess the knowledge, experience, and skills to assist the organization to evaluate current programs, set policy oncomplex program-related issues, and identify potential new programs and opportunities for growth.GOVERNANCE

Communities Threatened by a Panamanian DamProject 
In the early Spring of 2009, James Anaya, the UN
Special Rapporteur on the Situation of HumanRights and Fundamental Freedoms of IndigenousPeoples, toured the areas along the ChanguinolaRiver affected by the construction of thehydroelectric dam by the AES Corporation and thegovernment of Panama, after Cultural Survivalinformed him of this situation. The dam threatensfour Indigenous communities through flooding,including the Ngöbe, who have suffered seriousabuses and human rights violations. The Ngöbewere able to give their testimony to Anaya andwere encouraged by the chance finally to beheard. Isabel Becker, whose case we have writtenabout extensively, was among the people whomet with Anaya. She was held by AES for 12 hoursand forced to put her thumbprint on documentsshe couldn’t read, signing over her land to AES,and later was forcibly removed from her home.Becker's treatment is typical of the violationssuffered by the Ngöbe, whose community is nowsurrounded by a police cordon. Anaya publicizedhis report and put pressure on the Panamaniangovernment to comply with internationalobligations and respect Indigenous rights. TheMay 12 report confirmed Cultural Survival'scomplaints about the actions of the AESCorporation, which is building the dam inpartnership with the government of Panama, andechoed Cultural Survival's recommendations foraction.
