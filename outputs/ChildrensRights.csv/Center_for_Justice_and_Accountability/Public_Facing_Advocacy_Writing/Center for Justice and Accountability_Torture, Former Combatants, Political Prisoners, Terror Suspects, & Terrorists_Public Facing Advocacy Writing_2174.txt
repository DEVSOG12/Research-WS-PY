COURT RULES THAT U.S. GOVERN MENT CANNOT EV ADE SUBPOENAS 
 
U.S. STAT E DEPART MENT IS R EQUIRE D TO  COMP LY WITH SUBPOE NA F OR DOCUMENTS 
IN HUMAN RIGHTS C ASE AGAI NST FO RMER SOMALI PRIME MINISTER 
  
Washington, D.C.: A federal appeals court has  ruled that the U.S. Governm ent is required to com ply 
with subpoenas for docum ents in private lawsuits even  when the governm ent is not  directly involved in 
the case.  In so doing, the court rejected the Bu sh adm inistration’s argum ent that it is not bound by a 
federal rule governing the enforcem ent of subpoenas. 
 
The ruling stem s from a lawsuit f iled by several survivors of hum an rights abuses in Som alia against 
Moham ed Ali Sam antar, who served as Prim e Minist er and Defense Minister of the E ast African 
country during the 1980s.  In December 2004, attorneys from  the Center for Ju stice & Accountability 
(CJA) and Cooley Godward LLP, who are representing the survivors on a pro bono  basis, served a 
subpoena on the State Departm ent requesting U.S. governm ent docum ents relating to hum an rights and 
military is sues in Som alia. 
 
The Departm ent of Just ice, speaking on behalf of th e U.S. Governm ent, objected to attem pts to enforce 
the subpoena, arguing that the governm ent is not a “person” under Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure and therefore did not have to com ply with the subpoena.  The District Cou rt for the District of 
Colum bia agreed, holding that the s ubpoena was invalid.  T his ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the D.C. Circuit overturns that decision and sends th e cas e back to the Dis trict Court to enforce th e 
subpoena. 
 
Chief Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who was appointed to the D.C. Circuit by President Reagan, stated 
that the drafters of the rule on subpoenas “underestim ated the creativit y of the United S tates” when they 
concluded that the rule was “so si mple that it did not need any di scussion.”  He concluded, “That 
creativity notwithstanding, we hold the United States is a ‘p erson’ within  the m eaning of Rule 45 -- as it 
has been held to be under every Rule thus far litigated.” 
 
The lawsuit,  Yousuf, et al. v. Samantar , was f iled in the U.S. District Cou rt for the Ea stern Dis trict of 
Virginia in 2004 by CJA, a San Francisco-based n on-profit organization that works to end im punity by 
bringing to justice perpetrators of hum an rights a buses, and Cooley Godward, a national law firm .  The 
complaint alleges that Sam antar is responsible fo r torture, killings and crim es against hum anity 
comm itted by troops und er his command in Som alia.
