2002 to January 2003.  While at Guantánamo, Dr. Leso co-authored an interrogation policy memorandum that incorporated illegal techniques adapted from methods used by the Chinese and North Korean governments against U.S. prisoners of war.  He recommended a series of increasingly psychologically and physically abusive interrogation techniques to be applied against detainees held by the United States.  Many of the techniques and conditions that Dr. Leso helped put in place were applied to suspected al-Qaeda member Mohammed al Qahtani under Dr. Leso’s direct supervision, as well as to other men and boys held at Guantánamo.  Eventually, similar techniques were also used on prisoners held in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan.Professional AccountabilityDr. John Francis Leso is a licensed
