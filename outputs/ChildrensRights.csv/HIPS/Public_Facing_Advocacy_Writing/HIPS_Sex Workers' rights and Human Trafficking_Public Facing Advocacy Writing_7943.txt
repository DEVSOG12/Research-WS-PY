(Autostraddle)12/13/2019Article By:   ​NEESHA POWELL-TWAGIRUMUKIZA Imagine you’ve grinded for years as a member of a community coalition to get a hearing for a historic bill that will drastically improve your life if passed. A hearing is finally granted, and when the big day arrives, you scramble to get your John Hancock at the top of the list to give testimony.  Once the hearing begins, hours go by without your name being called. Although you signed up before them, representatives of organizations from other parts of the country and from other countries get their time at the mic before you. Worse, their speeches are denouncing the bill that you and other local grassroots organizers have put your blood, sweat, and tears into, labeling it harmful instead of helpful.  This was our reality on October 17th's hearing date.  [Read Article]“A lot of the groups that worked with this movement were put at the trailing end of the hearing, and it was a 14-hour-plus hearing. Those voices should have been heard well ahead of them, and if anything, those that were from out-of-state should have been put at the end. Accommodating them because they’re from out-of-state made absolutely no sense to a movement that is local." ​Tamika Spellman, HIPS Policy & Advocacy AssociateComments are closed.LocationWhat Our Clients Are Saying"I like HIPS because the people are honest and compassionate, they really put themselves on the line for us everyday."Contact UsSubscribeJoin our mailing list today!Join NowAboutMissionHistoryPolicyStaffBoard of DirectorsHIPS in the NewsPartnersImpactSupportersJobs>ID Community Health Worker (ID CHW)MAT Community Health Worker (CHW)Mobile Housing SpecialistHow We Improve LivesResources and Referrals>Abortion ResourcesHarm ReductionTransgender ResourcesOur ServicesHousing ResourcesSyringe ExchangeEmployment ResourcesAdvocacy>Chosen FewSex Worker Advocates Coalition (SWAC)Advisory Neighborhood Commission TrainingMedia InquiriesVideosDream IncubatorGet InvolvedSign on to SupportInternVolunteerSwagPride GearShirts & TanksSweatshirts, Fleece, & OuterwearHatsMugsBags & TotesJewelryPostersDressesAccessoriesDonateEventsNewsContact Us
