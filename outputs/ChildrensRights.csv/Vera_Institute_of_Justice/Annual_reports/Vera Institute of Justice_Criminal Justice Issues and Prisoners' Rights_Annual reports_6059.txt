This report discusses CEP activities in that year such as undergoing an intensive evaluation, launching a remedial education program, and enlarging the CEP's pool of community resources. The CEP was an experimental attempt to intervene in the usual court process just after a defendant's arrest ("pretrial diversion"). It offered defendants counseling and job opportunities and, if the defendant cooperated and showed promise of permanent change, recommended that the prosecutor and the judge dismiss the charges against him without ever deciding whether he was guilty. Thus, the MCEP attempted to convert a participant's arrest from a losing to a winning experience.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
