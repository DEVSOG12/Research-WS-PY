At Vera, we renewed our commitment to fight for justice, one built on the bedrock American values of fairness and human dignity. As always, our success in driving change was built on our strong partnerships with government and community leaders, particularly at the state and local levels. We continued to make great progress in our work to close mass incarceration’s front door, transform life behind bars, and deliver safety, trust, and justice to a more diverse America.From the Board ChairWhat We're Doing to Close Mass Incarceration's Front Door34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
