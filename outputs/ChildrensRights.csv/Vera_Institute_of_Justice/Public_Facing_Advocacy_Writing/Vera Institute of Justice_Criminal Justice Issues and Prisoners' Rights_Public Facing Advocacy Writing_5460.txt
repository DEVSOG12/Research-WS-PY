The governor also proposed other criminal justice reform measures as part of the address, including a law that would protect employers from lawsuits for hiring people with justice system involvement, a constitutional amendment on victims’ rights, and the creation of a home-building program to provide skilled workforce training for incarcerated people."I don't believe that voting rights should be forever stripped, and I don't believe restoration should be in the hands of a single person," Governor Reynolds said in her prepared remarks. Iowa, Kentucky, and Virginia all have lifetime bans in their constitutions, and all currently allow the governor to restore voting rights to individuals.A number of states have worked to restore voting rights for people with conviction histories in recent years. Voters in Florida approved a ballot measure in 2018 that overturned the state’s lifetime voting ban—a move that restored voting rights for an estimated 1.4 million people in that state. In 2017, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed a law that restored the voting rights of thousands of people. At least two states are pushing to restore voting rights for all citizens age 18 and older—including those in prison—which is the current policy in Maine, Puerto Rico, and Vermont. Polls show that a majority of Americans support these measures.RelatedNEWSJurisdictions Should Embrace Voting Rights for All Americans—Including Those Who Are IncarceratedNov 02, 2018NEWSMajority of Americans Say Voting Rights Should be Restored for People with Felony ConvictionsMar 22, 2018NEWSStates Continue to Make Progress on Restoring Voting Rights for People with Conviction HistoriesNov 01, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
