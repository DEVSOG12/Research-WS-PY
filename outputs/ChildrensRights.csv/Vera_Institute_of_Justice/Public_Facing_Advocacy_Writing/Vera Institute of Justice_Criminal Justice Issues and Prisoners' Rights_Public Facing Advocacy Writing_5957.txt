Leah Morgan, the coordinator of Vera’s Ohio Green Prison Project, contributed to this issue with her article, “Green Job Training in Prisons Benefits Everyone.”Many of the articles focus on the benefit to corrections agencies and their budgets of sustainability initiatives. In contrast, Leah’s article demonstrates the importance of green efforts to job training and reentry planning for inmates. Leah describes the importance of Vera’s partnership with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction and the steps that departments of corrections and facilities can take to adopt a greener approach in operations as one part of a green job-training and reentry planning program. This ambitious project has great potential to make facilities more environmentally neutral and provide meaningful job prospects for incarcerated men and women returning to the community.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
