HUD’s guidance, and the president’s support, is a testament to our government partners, including the Housing Authority of New Orleans and the New York City Housing Authority, whose efforts were referenced among the best practices detailed in HUD’s guidance. It is also a testament to the many community advocates for fairer treatment of persons with criminal convictions, whose efforts have been at the forefront of driving the change that is now underway.To help shine a light on the HUD guidance, Vera is partnering with the Sergeant Shriver National Center for Poverty Law to organize a webinar in the coming weeks. In the meantime, take a look at a recent fact sheet produced by Vera’s Family Justice Program to learn about other ways housing authorities are increasing access to people with conviction histories.The president signaled the importance of opening the doors of public housing to people with criminal convictions by including it in a package of policy changes that address the ways government over-punishes people arrested and convicted of crimes. He called for “steps to make our criminal justice system fairer and more effective and to address the vicious cycle of poverty, criminality, and incarceration that traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities.” Rather than continuing punishment, our public housing authorities can play a supportive role in helping people succeed, to the benefit of the entire community. HUD’s guidance provides a helpful framework to the authorities, such as in New York City and New Orleans, who are finding ways to play that role.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
