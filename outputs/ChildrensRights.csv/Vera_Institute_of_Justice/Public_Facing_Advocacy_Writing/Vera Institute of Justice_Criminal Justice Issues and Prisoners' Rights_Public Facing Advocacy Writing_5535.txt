The Voting Restoration Amendment—a proposed constitutional amendment that would automatically restore voting rights for most people convicted of nonviolent crimes—reached the 766,200 signature threshold to be placed on the ballot in November.This Election Day, Americans will go to the polls to cast theirvotes and make their voices heard. But not everyone will be able to vote.Thousands of people who want to vote will be denied this rightbecause of their criminal histories. While laws differ from state to state, anestimated 2.5 percent of Americans—6.1 million voters—are disenfranchised dueto past felony convictions. In many states, this includes people who haveserved their time in prison, yet can’t vote because they are still on probationor parole. In four states—Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Iowa—regaining the right tovote is so onerous that formerly incarcerated people are essentially barred forlife from exercising this civic right.Some states—both red and blue—have started to change this. If wecare about reintegrating people who have been incarcerated into society, we shouldwant more states to follow suit.Stripping people of this basic right is not only bad for thepeople it affects and their communities—it’s also bad for democracy. After all,democracy thrives—and survives—on participation.In 2016, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe individually restored the rights of around 13,000 formerly incarcerated people—with the goal ofrestoring thousands more before the end of his term. And, earlier thisyear, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed a law restoring voting rightsfor thousands of people. Across the country, a total of 49 pieces oflegislation were introduced in 16 states during last year’s legislative sessionto restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated people who have served theirsentences.There is even bipartisan support for reform at the federal level. Republican Rand Paul—along with numerous Democrats—has expressed support for restoring voting rights to people who are formerly incarcerated.Those who have paid their debt to society deserve the opportunity to reintegrate as full participants in civic life.Not only is the restoration of voting rights a benefit to our democracy, it's also a benefit to those who are personally impacted. While community support is essential to a person's successful reentry after incarceration, this support is—in large part—dependent on a person's ability to engage in their community in the first place. One of the most essential ways this can happen is through the ballot box, giving a voice and agency to the person casting a vote. Voting also has the power to bind community members together as a shared civic experience.Formerly incarcerated people already face significant hurdles to reentry, including difficulty finding employment, maintaining stable housing, and reestablishing connections with their families and communities. These barriers can exacerbate feelings of isolation, shame, and frustration—which in turn can lead to increased criminal activity.Rather than compounding barriers to reentry, we must give formerly incarcerated people every opportunity to regain the community and family support necessary to succeed after their release. This is in everyone's interest, given that 95 percent of incarcerated people will eventually return home.The right to vote is a fundamental tenet of democracy. Those who have paid their debt to society deserve the opportunity for a second chance and a chance to reintegrate as full participants in civic life.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
