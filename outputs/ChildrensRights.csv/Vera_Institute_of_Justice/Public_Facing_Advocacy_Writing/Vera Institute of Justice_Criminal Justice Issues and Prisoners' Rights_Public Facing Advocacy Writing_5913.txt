Recidivism is the best measure of a prison system’s effectiveness, and reducing it is the key to public safety. Research shows that the most effective use of corrections dollars is to target moderate-to-high-risk offenders, a concept referred to as the “risk principle.” By concentrating prison and supervision resources on these individuals, using the best available science, Delaware can improve public safety, hold offenders accountable, and contain corrections costs.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
