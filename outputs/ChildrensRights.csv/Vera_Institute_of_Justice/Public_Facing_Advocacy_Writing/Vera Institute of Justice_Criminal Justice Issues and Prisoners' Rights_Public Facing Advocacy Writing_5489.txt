Yesterday, another group joined thecall—a group of 40 business leaders who purchased a full-page ad in the New York Times encouraging New York lawmakersto act before the end of the state legislative session on June 20.The signatories included Ursula Burns, executive chairman of VEON Ltd., RonaldPerelman of MacAndrews and Forbes, and Bill Lauder, executive chairman of theEstée Lauder Companies, along with many others from both sides of the politicalaisle.These business leaders said that “bail reform is in the bestinterest of the individuals, families, and businesses that make up our communities.”They’re right.Using moneyas the key determinant of a person’s liberty is unjust. Earlier this year, a report by the New York City Comptroller found that people in custody lose about$28 million in annual wages because they cannot afford to make bail. The lucky ones—those able to pay a bailbondsman to get out of jail—collectively forfeit between $16 million and $27million a year in nonrefundable fees to the commercial bail industry.The cost of ourbroken bail system to incarcerated people, family members, and taxpayers isunconscionable, especially in the face of research that shows that people don’tneed money at stake to show up to court. For the vast majority of peoplearrested, a reminder of their next court date, transportation to court, andaccess to pretrial services is all they need to safely be at home, in theirjobs, and with their families pending trial. The bipartisan group of businessleaders who signed onto bail reform yesterday recognized that it simply makesgood sense to take money out of the equation when it comes to bail.
