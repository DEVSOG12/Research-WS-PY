All the legislators were thoughtful and asked good questions, and the supporters of the legislation clearly hope that it will be used in a limited and targeted fashion by their (relatively) non-political prosecutors. I tried to make the point that, in the U.S. context at least, these kinds of laws tend to be enforced with broad strokes and sweep huge numbers of low-level users and dealers into state prison systems at huge costs and little to no benefit. My fear is that despite their intent to only use these laws sparingly, street level enforcement will result in many more people being subject to these sentences than the legislators anticipate.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
