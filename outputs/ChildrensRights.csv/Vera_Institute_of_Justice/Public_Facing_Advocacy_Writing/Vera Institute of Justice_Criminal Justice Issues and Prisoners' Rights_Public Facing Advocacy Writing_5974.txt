The U-visa provides legal immigration status for crime victims who cooperate with law enforcement in investigating, prosecuting, and solving cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, and other crimes.Through the National Immigrant Victims’ Access to Justice Partnership, CIJ works with the nonprofit organization Legal Momentum to train law enforcement agencies on using the U-visa. Sergeant Inspector Flores’s substantial experience with the U-visa application process has brought tremendous value to the project, facilitating his ability to assist fellow officers to deepen their understanding of this useful tool.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
