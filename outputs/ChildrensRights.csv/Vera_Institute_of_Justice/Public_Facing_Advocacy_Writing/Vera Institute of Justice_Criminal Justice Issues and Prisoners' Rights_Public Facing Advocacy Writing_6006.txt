Kessler’s trademark approach, known as “evidence-based prosecution,” does not equate to victim safety being compromised in most cases.In fact, for years, advocates in the field of violence against women have been pushing for evidence-based prosecution. Victims are often pressured to recant, but work in the field suggests that they would actually prefer that the prosecutor move forward. Evidence-based prosecution allows this to happen.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
