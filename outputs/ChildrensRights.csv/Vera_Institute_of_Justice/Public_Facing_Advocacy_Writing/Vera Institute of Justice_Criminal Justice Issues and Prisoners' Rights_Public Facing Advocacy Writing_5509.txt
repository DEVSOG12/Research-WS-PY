This consensus spanned the political spectrum.An estimated six million people are currently disenfranchised, with the process for restoring voting rights differing from state to state. Some states automatically restore rights once someone has completed their sentence. Others restore rights as soon as someone is released from incarceration. In four states—Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Iowa—regaining the right to vote is extremely difficult, and often means that certain people with histories of justice involvement never vote again. Alabama recently restored voting rights for thousands of people with felony convictions.Read the full poll results here. And, read how more and more states are acting on public support to restore voting rights.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
