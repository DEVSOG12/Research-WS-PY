We will highlight a number of contributions to the body of research on the relationship between criminal justice and blackness in America—from books on mass incarceration and the War on Drugs to documentaries about the direct path from slavery to incarceration, as well as key reports within Vera’s own body of work that relate to the black community, including an upcoming report on racial disparity in jails across America.We’ll also be sharing quotes, images, and statistics about the state of criminal justice and the black community taken from our own archives—as well as from the Smithsonian’s powerful National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), located on the National Mall in Washington, DC.We’re proud and excited to spend this month highlighting issues that are central to the black community, including work we’ve been doing at Vera since 1961. We’re also determined to keep pushing forward to drive change, in eager anticipation of the day when everyone will have equal justice under the law.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
