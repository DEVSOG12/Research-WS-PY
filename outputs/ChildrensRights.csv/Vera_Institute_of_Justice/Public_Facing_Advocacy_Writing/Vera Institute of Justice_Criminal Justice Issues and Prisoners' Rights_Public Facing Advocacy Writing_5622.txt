Now think aboutnot having a place to stay or family to support you during this time ofhardship. Would you have made it? For people recently convicted of acrime, having a place to stay and the support of family are often themost influential factors in their success. But for decades, housingauthorities across the country have not allowed recently convictedpeople to access public housing, even though many had loved ones wholived there. Today, the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) has changed its rules.New Orleans sends more people to jail and prison than almost anyother place in the country per capita. Thousands of New Orleanians havecriminal convictions and struggle to stay on their feet. Eighty-five percent of people inour jail are black and communities of color are most significantlyimpacted by the obstacles that people with convictions face, such asfinding employment and housing.Going forward HANO will use a set of criteria based on the severityof the crime and the time since conviction to determine if an applicantshould be admitted to HANO-subsidized housing or evaluated further. As aresult, no applicant will be denied housing because of her criminalrecord without consideration of individual and present circumstances.For serious and/or recent convictions, a panel will review theapplication and make a decision based on the person’s criminal history,rehabilitation efforts, community ties, and employment history. This newprocess is in line with best practices recommended by the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But HANO has distinguished itself by becoming the first housing authority in the country to take these steps.It took more than three years to develop and approve this change, butthe process has been as important as the end result. At the urging oflocal advocates, HANO developed the new rules with grassrootsorganizations that represent formerly incarcerated people and publichousing applicants, fair housing advocacy groups, criminal justiceagencies, landlords, and private property managers. This collaborationwas instrumental in developing a model policy that reflects theinterests of people with convictions, their families, their communities,and the broader public housing community.However, the new policy contains a possible exemption for privatemanagers of public housing developments with contracts that allow themto set their own rules. That means public housing applicants withcriminal backgrounds may be denied if they apply to one of these sites.To truly become the model agency it aspires to be, HANO will need tofind a way to apply its new policies to every site so that all NewOrleanians with criminal convictions can access the same opportunitiesfor success.Nonetheless, this policy is an enormous step for HANO towardsensuring more fair and rational access to public housing, a criticalpublic resource. All over the country, too many people with criminalconvictions are kept from stability and the support of their loved ones.Other housing authorities should look to HANO’s example for guidance asthey seek to help people with convictions successfully reenter theircommunities and rejoin their families in public housing.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
