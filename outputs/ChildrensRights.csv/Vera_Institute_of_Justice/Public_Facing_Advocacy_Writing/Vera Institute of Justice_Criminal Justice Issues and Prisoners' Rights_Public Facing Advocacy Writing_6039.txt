Last week the publication was cited in an article profiling the work of the Brewster (New York) Police Department, which is using interpreters at community forums to communicate with its growing Latino community.The July 2009 issue of Community Policing Dispatch also profiled the report. The e-newsletter, published by the US DOJ Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (the COPS Office), aims to educate readers about criminal justice issues that affect community policing and provides law enforcement professionals with resources to help them build partnerships with the communities they serve.To get a free hardcopy of our publication and see what people are talking about, order it online through the COPS Office website.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
