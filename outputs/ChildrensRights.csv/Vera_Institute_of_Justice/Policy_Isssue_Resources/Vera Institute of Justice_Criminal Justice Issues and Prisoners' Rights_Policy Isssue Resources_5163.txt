No detailed agenda was specified, but the following expectations emerged: 1) that a small Vera staff might, by developing a day-to-day collaborative relationship with British statutory agencies (e.g., probation, police and prison services), bring U.S. experience and Vera's action-research approach to bear upon particular problems in the administration of British justice; 2) through sustained working relationships and through periodic visits to the U.S. by British criminal justice representatives, draw upon the relevant British experience, programs, procedures and research to devise innovative approaches to problems in the administration of American justice and, generally, facilitate the transfer of technologies between the jurisdiction; and 3) that this effort might reveal the possibilities and limitations peculiar to technology transfer models of this design.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
