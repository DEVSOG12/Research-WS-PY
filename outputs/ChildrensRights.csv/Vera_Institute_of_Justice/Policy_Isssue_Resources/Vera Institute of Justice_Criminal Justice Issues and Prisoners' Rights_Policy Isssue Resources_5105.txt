Two scheduled events necessitated it; 1) a major reduction of the caseload of Summons Court in March, 1980 due to the transfer of peddler-related cases to the Environmental Control Board and 2) the decentralization of 346 Broadway on April, 1980, which would entail the transfer of remaining summonsable offenses back to criminal courts in individual boroughs.AuthorsMichele Sviridoff34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
