Smith Before the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile DelinquencyOverviewThis 1978 testimony discusses the need for programs and for program-related research targeting serious juvenile delinquents. It also discusses the unpopularity of this issue and the lack of funding available for this kind of work.
