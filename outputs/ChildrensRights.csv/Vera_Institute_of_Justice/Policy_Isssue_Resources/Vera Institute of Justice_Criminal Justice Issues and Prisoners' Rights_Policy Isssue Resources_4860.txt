This is the first study to examine the city’s coordinated ATI system for people convicted of felonies—and one of the only studies nationally to examine the content of alternative sentencing programs as well as their long-term recidivism rates. Vera found that people sent to ATIs showed the same rate of re-offending up to three years later as those in a matched comparison group, despite spending much less time incarcerated during the study period.AuthorsRachel Porter34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
