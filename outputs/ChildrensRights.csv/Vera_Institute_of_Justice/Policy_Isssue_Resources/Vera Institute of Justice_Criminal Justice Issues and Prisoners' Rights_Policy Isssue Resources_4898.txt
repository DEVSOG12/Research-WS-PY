We conducted interviews and observations and obtained information on rates of representation and case outcomes for New York City. We also obtained data for other jurisdictions to see if the experience in New York City was unique or representative of the country as a whole. With this combination of qualitative and quantitative information, we were able to substantially clarify longstanding assumptions about the role and effect of legal counsel in Immigration Court.AuthorsFelinda Mottino34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
