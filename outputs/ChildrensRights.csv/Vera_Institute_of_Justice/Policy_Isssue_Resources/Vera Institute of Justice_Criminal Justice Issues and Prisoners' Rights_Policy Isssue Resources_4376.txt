As a result of local and state campaigns, more than 40 jurisdictions across the country now fund deportation defense programs. With the growing injustices and instability that federal immigration enforcement and the spread of COVID-19 have brought to communities, local and state public investment in deportation defense is needed now more than ever. Vera, along with the National Immigration Law Center and Center for Popular Democracy, has developed Advancing Universal Representation: A Toolkit for Advocates, Organizers, Legal Service Providers, and Policymakers. This fact sheet provides a summary of insights included in its second module.Key TakeawayThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to universal representation campaigns, and strategies must be tailored to local circumstances. But there are many lessons to be learned. Successful campaigns should be grounded in diverse coalitions that are inclusive, intersectional, and led by those directly impacted by detention and the immigration system.Key FactsSuccessful campaigns start with campaign plans anddiverse coalitions.Coalitions should develop a clear strategy and coordinate with intersecting campaigns.Campaigns should usedata and evidenceto explain the need for and scope and importance of legal representation in immigration work, and should empower community members to tell their own stories.Considerframing universal representationnot only as an end goal but also as an important step, and understand the broader context and ultimate movement goals.RelatedARTICLEAdvancing Universal RepresentationDec 10, 2018PUBLICATIONRising to the Moment: Advancing the National Movement for Universal RepresentationDec 15, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
