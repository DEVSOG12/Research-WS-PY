Originally intended to manage people who committed violence within jails and prisons, restrictive housing has become a common tool for responding to all levels of rule violations, from minor to serious; managing challenging populations; and housing people considered vulnerable, especially those living with mental illness.A number of departments of corrections are now taking steps to reduce their reliance on restrictive housing. Through a competitive application process, Vera selected and worked with five sites—Nebraska; Oregon; North Carolina; New York City; and Middlesex County, New Jersey—to study their use of restrictive housing and make recommendations for ways to reduce the practice. This report summarizes Vera’s key findings and recommendations.Explore additional technical reports for these five sites.AuthorsSara SullivanLéon DigardElena VankoKey TakeawayOur partners’ work shows that agencies can take steps to reduce their use of restrictive housing. Other leaders who are serious about rethinking conditions of confinement can benefit from the practical solutions described in this report.Publication HighlightsIn 2014, administrators from 40 state departments of corrections reported that they had recently conducted reviews of their restrictive housing policies; by 2016, many of those jurisdictions had planned or enacted changes to reduce their reliance on this type of custody.Echoing disparities seen throughout the criminal justice system, Vera’s analysis found that people with mental health needs, young men, and people of color were more likely to be held in restrictive housing.Vera recommends that jails and prisons use restrictive housing only as a last resort, as a response to the most serious and threatening behavior, for the shortest time possible, and with the least restrictive conditions possible.Key FactsLow-level nonviolent offenses were amongthe most commondisciplinary infractions to result in disciplinary segregation sanctions.In North Carolina,none of the top 10 infractions resulting in disciplinary segregationwere among the most serious charges.In Nebraska,44 percent of all incarcerated people had been placed in restrictive housing as punishment for an infraction or pending an investigationduring the course of their incarceration.In Oregon,59% of people who entered the most stringent form of administrative segregationspent more than a year in some form of restrictive housing.RelatedPUBLICATIONSolitary ConfinementMay 12, 2015NEWSNon-traditional Allies Reforming Restrictive Housing in UtahApr 26, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
