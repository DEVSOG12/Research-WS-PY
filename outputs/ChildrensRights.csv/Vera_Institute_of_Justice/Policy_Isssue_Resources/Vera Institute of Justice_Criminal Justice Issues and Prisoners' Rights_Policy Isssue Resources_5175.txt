The Argus referral resulted in a marked, although not statistically significant reduction of prison sentences without a concurrent increase in recidivism. It observes that if the Bronx Sentencing-Argus referral system were restricted to defendants with good rehabilitative prospects, Argus might not only reduce prison dispositions but also reduce recidivism. To adequately test this prediction, a repetition of the experiment with certain modifications is recommended.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
