With support from the American Bar Association’s World Justice Project, the Vera Institute of Justice partnered with three fellow Altus Global Alliance members to develop a set of 60 rule of law indicators—concrete measures designed to assess an abstract concept—and test them in four cities: Chandigarh, India; Lagos, Nigeria; Santiago, Chile; and New York City, U.S. This pilot project shows that a single set of indicators can be flexible enough to be used in extremely diverse jurisdictions internationally yet concrete enough to be meaningful to local policy makers, justice system professionals, and members of civil society.AuthorsJim Parsons34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
