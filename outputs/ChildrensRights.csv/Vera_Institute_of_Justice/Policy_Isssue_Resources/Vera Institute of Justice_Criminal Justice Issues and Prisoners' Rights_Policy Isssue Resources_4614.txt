While local governments and legislatures across the country have shown interest in supporting unaccompanied immigrant youth through measures that increase their access to lawyers, schools, and healthcare, a lack of knowledge about their circumstances and needs presents an obstacle to policymaking and improving practical responses.To understand these circumstances and needs, Vera and Fordham Law School’s Feerick Center for Social Justice designed a study to focus on unaccompanied youth living in the New York City metropolitan area. The study further involved these youth as peer researchers, and the results provide a firsthand account oftheir needs and insights into the challenges of interacting with various U.S.systems.AuthorsLaura SimichKaren BerberichKey TakeawayToimprove the life opportunities of these youth, we must recognize that they areresilient and capable; provide community-based services—such as legal services,employment and housing assistance, educational scholarships, and health exams—thatmeet their basic needs; and promote their legal and social acceptance in thecommunity.Publication HighlightsPromoting theparticipation of unaccompanied immigrant youth in the development of thepolicies that affect them is necessary to facilitate successful outcomes.Two overarching themes of the study were identity and discrimination—youth often experienced a loss of identity, discrimination, and stereotyping from the adults and peers they interacted with.Unaccompanied immigrant youth are often forced by circumstances to prioritize finding shelter and work over finding the legal assistance they need.Key FactsBefore October 2011, the number of unaccompanied children taken into federal immigration custody annually averaged between 7,000 and 8,000.By FY 2014, that number soared to68,541In FY 2014,nearly 6,000 unaccompanied youthreunified with adults living in New York StateApproximately85%of children apprehended by federal authorities reunify with a relative or family friend already living in the U.S.Unaccompanied minors who are represented in immigration court, as compared to those without legal representation,have a far better chance of obtaining the legal relief from deportation to which they are entitled.RelatedVIDEOStruggle for Identity and InclusionAug 04, 2015NEWSUnaccompanied youth voice their struggle for identity and inclusionAug 04, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
