In April 2018, the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) developed and launched the Bail Assessment Pilot, a mini-demonstration project in the Bronx and Queens arraignment courts in New York City. The project was designed to challenge the way bail is typically set, which—until the enactment of new legislation in January 2020—does not explicitly require consideration of a person’s ability to pay. As part of the Bail Assessment Pilot, Vera created an ability to pay “calculator” to estimate how much bail someone can afford and in what form. This policy brief provides an overview of the pilot and a description of the calculator’s development and implementation.AuthorsSandra van den HeuvelAnton RobinsonInsha RahmanKey TakeawayThe tools developed through the pilot have immediate potential to change the use of bail nationwide in courtrooms where money bail is imposed daily. Defense attorneys, pretrial services officers, judges, and family members can use Vera’s bail calculator to help assess an individual’s ability to pay bail.Publication HighlightsThe Bail Assessment Pilot was launched to assess the impact of providing individualized information about ability to pay on judges’ bail-setting practices.Incremental fixes such as this pilot and the bail calculator are important steps to making the use of money bail fairer as we work to end its use entirely.Defense attorneys serve as gatekeepers and refer cases to the pilot’s bail specialist only when they believe bail will likely be set, a safeguard to prevent overreach and net widening.Key FactsOne study found that bail was set nearly$10Khigher on average for Black people than for their white counterparts.Between 1990 and 2009, the use of bail for people charged with felonies increased from53%to 72 percent of cases in large urban counties.Over the same period, the median amount of bail for felonies in the U.S.increased to$11,700.RelatedPUBLICATIONNew York, New YorkJul 17, 2019PUBLICATIONAgainst the OddsSep 15, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
