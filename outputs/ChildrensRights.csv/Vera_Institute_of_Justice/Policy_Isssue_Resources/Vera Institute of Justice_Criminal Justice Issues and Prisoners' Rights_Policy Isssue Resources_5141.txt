It describes the deterioration of cases that takes place as they make their way towards final disposition. More importantly, it explores some underlying patterns which tend to explain how and why such deterioration takes place. It attempts to identify and understand the complex factors that have prevented the criminal justice system from having the effect that society desires.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
