The project’s multidisciplinary services provide essential support networks and enable clients to live as independently as possible—regardless of their ability to pay. The COVID-19 pandemic and looming budget cuts are now threatening the lives of Guardianship clients: many have already died, mostly in nursing homes.Key TakeawayWithout city funding for the upcoming fiscal year, Guardianship Project clients are likely to become further institutionalized at a higher cost to taxpayers down the road. By allowing the Guardianship Project to continue supporting vulnerable New Yorkers, renewing city funding to the Guardianship Project will not only save taxpayer dollars, it will also save lives.Publication HighlightsThrough the role of court-appointed guardian, the project humanely addresses the critical needs of highly vulnerable clients, saves public dollars, and allows key institutions to operate more effectively.Project staff include lawyers, social workers, finance associates, property managers, and benefits coordinators, who oversee an array of services and help clients remain independent and engaged in their communities.Without renewed funding, the Guardianship Project cannot continue coordinating clients’ care, monitoring their health, and delivering essential resources. Many clients would be forced to move into nursing homes or institutions.Key FactsThe total cost of the Guardianship Project to the city is only$750,000a year—a tiny fraction of its $89.3 billion annual budget.Health outcomes vary starkly between clients in nursing homes and in community-based care.82%of Guardianship clients who tested positive or were symptomatic of the COVID-19 virus were institutionalized.RelatedPUBLICATIONIncapacitated, Indigent, and AloneAug 08, 2019NEWSGuardians and the End-of-Life Decision Making DilemmaFeb 12, 2018NEWSThe Question of Guardianship: How the Elderly Lose Their RightsNov 27, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
