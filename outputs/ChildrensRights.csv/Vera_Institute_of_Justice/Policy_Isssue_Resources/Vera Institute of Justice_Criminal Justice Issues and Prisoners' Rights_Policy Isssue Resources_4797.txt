Their fear is exacerbated when they continue to be threatened and harassed after an arrest has been made—especially when the defendant is being held without bail. Recognizing this dilemma and its impact on the system of justice, prosecutors in Milwaukee County began using jailhouse telephone recordings and other evidence to prosecute defendants who use threats of violence or intimidation to try to influence witness testimony and case outcomes. This publication explores this practice and includes a DVD highlighting both the problem and the response. It is part of the Judicial Oversight Demonstration Initiative's four-part series Enhancing Responses to Domestic Violence.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
