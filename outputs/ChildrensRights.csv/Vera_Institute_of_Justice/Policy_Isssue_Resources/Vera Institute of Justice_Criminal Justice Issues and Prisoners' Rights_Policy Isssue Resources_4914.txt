Their stories reveal patterns of success and failure in the effort to find a place to live and land a job, to comply and feel satisfied with parole supervision, to reunite with family, to stay away from alcohol and other drugs, and to avoid a return to crime. This study reveals why and how the initial reentry period is so difficult. At the same time, it provides evidence of the strong desire among most recently released individuals to turn their lives around. The report offers concrete suggestions for how to prepare inmates for the predictable challenges they will encounter the moment they return home.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
