In partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), Vera launched a project to explore these issues. This brief presents the project findings. It gives an overview of the latest research on the incidence and prevalence of sexual violence in the lives of men with disabilities and Deaf men, identifies gaps in the field’s knowledge on the subject, and documents the unique barriers both groups face in accessing services. It concludes by looking ahead to how additional research, public policy changes, and educational efforts can contribute to ending the victimization of men with disabilities and Deaf men.AuthorsAllison HastingsSandra HarrellKey TakeawayEnhancements are necessary to victim services and justice-systems responses to ensure that all survivors, including men with disabilities and Deaf men, receive vital healing services.Publication HighlightsMale survivors with disabilities who experience sexual violence face multiple barriers to reaching out and receiving help.The organizations often active in the lives of people with disabilities are not prepared to address victimization in the lives of the people they serve; victim services are not always accessible for people with disabilities; there are few organizations that bridge these gaps.More research is needed to understand how often men with disabilities experience domestic violence and their experiences when seeking help.Key FactsThe 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that men with disabilities and Deaf men weretwiceas likely as their counterparts without disabilities to experience sexual violence other than rape.Researchers found that the prevalence of lifetime sexual violent victimization was14%among men with disabilities/Deaf men, compared to 4 percent among men without disabilities.In a study of 79 Deaf adults, nearly45%of the men reported at least one form of sexual abuse in their lifetime.RelatedPUBLICATIONHow Safe Are Americans with Disabilities?Apr 27, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
