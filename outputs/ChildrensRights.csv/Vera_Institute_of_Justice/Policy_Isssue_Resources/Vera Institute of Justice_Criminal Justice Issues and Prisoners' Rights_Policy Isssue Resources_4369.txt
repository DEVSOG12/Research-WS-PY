The new law mandated pretrial release for the vast majority of nonviolent charges and required that judges consider a person’s ability to pay bail.A comprehensive impact evaluation is necessary to understand the successes and limitations of these reforms, as well as their unintended consequences. The Vera Institute of Justice is conducting a three-and-a-half-year study to examine how front-end reforms at arrest and arraignment impact back-end outcomes, including the use of jails for pretrial detention and other custody types.This jail brief—the first of Vera’s six-part jail brief series—explores the early impact of bail reform on jail populations by examining statewide incarceration trends between January 2018 and June 2020. The brief also explores early impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on jail admissions and populations.AuthorsJaeok KimQuinn HoodElliot ConnorsKey TakeawayBail reform led to a substantial reduction in jail incarceration, driven mainly by a decline in pretrial admissions for low-level and nonviolent charges. However, despite the overall decreased incarceration rate, existing racial disparities may have been aggravated both in New York City and statewide jails.Key FactsBail reform appears to have had abigger impactin counties outside of New York City.The number of people admitted to jails because they could not afford to pay baildecreased substantiallyafter the implementation of bail reform.Although bail reform led to a reduction in the overall number of people incarcerated in New York, it may haveexacerbated racial disparities.RelatedSPECIAL REPORT (SINGLE)The Cost of Incarceration in New York StateDec 15, 2020PUBLICATIONNew York, New YorkJul 17, 2019ARTICLEEmpire State of Incarceration 2021Feb 18, 202134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
