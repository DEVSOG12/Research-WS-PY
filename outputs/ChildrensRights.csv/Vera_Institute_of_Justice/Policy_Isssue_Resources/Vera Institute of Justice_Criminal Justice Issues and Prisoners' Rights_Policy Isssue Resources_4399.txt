Vera’s analysis of the most comprehensive jail data available shows that the number of people in jail in the United States fell by one quarter, mainly over the course of that month.Jail bookings dropped as people who would otherwise have been arrested stayed home, and police and sheriffs made fewer arrests. Simultaneously, many judges and prosecutors used their broad discretion to facilitate the release of people they deemed “safe,” while public defenders filed thousands of motions to secure the release of their clients. But as the United States faces continued outbreaks of COVID-19, it is crucial to recognize that decarceration has still been inadequate, from both a public safety and a public health perspective.Key TakeawayMaintaining recent reductions and further reducing jail populations will make communities safer in the coming months and years by reducing the likelihood and severity of future outbreaks of COVID-19 and enabling reinvestment of state and local dollars into community-based services and resources that support public health and public safety.Publication HighlightsVera studied 1,278 counties. In 527 counties, the number of people in jail declined rapidly and remained stable in the following weeks.In 454 counties, the jail population never decreased substantially.In 270 counties, the jail population initially decreased but then increased quickly, approaching previous levels of incarceration.Key FactsVera’s analysis suggests that nationally there may have been approximately200,000 fewer people in jailat the beginning of June than in mid-March.This estimate means the United States may havereduced its jail population by more than 25%in a matter of months.RelatedNEWSCOVID-19 Imperils People in Rural JailsApr 01, 2020SPOTLIGHTCriminal Justice and the COVID-19 PandemicMay 06, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
