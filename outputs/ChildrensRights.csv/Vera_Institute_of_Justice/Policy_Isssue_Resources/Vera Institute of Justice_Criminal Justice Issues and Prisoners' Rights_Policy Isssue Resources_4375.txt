But spending on jails continues to climb. In 2019, the 57 counties outside New York City collectively spent more than $1.3 billion to staff and run their jails. Counties must cut jail spending and reinvest those savings in communities most impacted by mass incarceration. In this report, Vera shows how if counties keep their incarceration rates as low as they were in June 2020 and reduce their spending on staffing accordingly, they could save up to $638 million annually. By diverting these savings to programming and social services, counties could build safer, more stable communities. To do so, the State first has to amend rules that require each county to maintain its own jail and mandate minimum staffing obligations. The State also should incentivize counties to invest in programs and services that build healthier, safer communities that do not rely on jails.AuthorsLauren JonesSandra van den HeuvelAmanda LawsonKey TakeawayIf New York counties keep their incarceration rates at June 2020 levels and reduce their spending on staffing accordingly, they could save up to $638 million annually.
