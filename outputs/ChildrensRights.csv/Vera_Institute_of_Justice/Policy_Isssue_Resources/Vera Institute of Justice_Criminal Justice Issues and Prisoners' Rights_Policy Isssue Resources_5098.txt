Formed from the Vera Institute of Justice Pretrial Services Agency on August 1, 1977, CJA operates to assist the criminal justice system by: decreasing the number of days in detention by defendants who could safely be released while awaiting trial; reducing the rate of nonappearance in court by defendants released by detention and awaiting trial; and operating a citywide pretrial services agency providing a variety of services to the public, criminal justice agencies and defendants, enabling the pretrial process to operate with greater efficiency and fairness. The evaluation suggests that CJA plays an important and necessary role in criminal case processing in New York City.AuthorsSteven R.
