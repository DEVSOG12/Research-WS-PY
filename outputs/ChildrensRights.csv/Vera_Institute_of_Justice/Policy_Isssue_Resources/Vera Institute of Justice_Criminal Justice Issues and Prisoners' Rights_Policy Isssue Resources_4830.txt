In plain language, the Guide describes how to develop practical and effective indicators in both data-poor and data-rich environments, starting with the desired outcome. Specific chapters explore the role of indicators in measuring progress in the safety and justice sector as a whole, within specific state institutions ranging from law enforcement to prisons, and among the wide variety of non-state justice institutions. Each chapter describes:1. Traditional indicators used to measure performance across the justice sector or within a particular institution; 2. Provides examples of specific policy goals that require new indicators; 3. Suggests innovative indicators capable of reflecting progress towards those goals and possible sources of data; 4. Discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the suggested indicators.AuthorsTodd Foglesong34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
