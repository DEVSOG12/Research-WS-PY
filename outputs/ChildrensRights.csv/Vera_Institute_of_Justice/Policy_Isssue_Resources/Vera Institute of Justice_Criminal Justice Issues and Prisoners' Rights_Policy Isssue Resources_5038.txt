The NYPD ran a demonstration project in the 72nd precinct in Kings County in which nine patrol beats were established. Vera's research department conducted a careful evaluation of its operation, its effects on the community, and its efficacy addressing the major crime and quality-of-life problems in each beat. This progress report focuses on the manner in which the project was implemented, the degree to which officers assigned as CPOs adapted to their new duties, and the initial perception of the effort by community leaders and residents.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
