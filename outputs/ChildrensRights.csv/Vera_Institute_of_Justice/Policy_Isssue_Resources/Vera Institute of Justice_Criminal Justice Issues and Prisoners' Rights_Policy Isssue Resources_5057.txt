Begun in 1978, this program adapted Vera's "supported work" concept to adults with borderline mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. Vera originally developed the paradigm of supported work when it sought to create transitional employment opportunities to help ex-offenders and ex-addicts become acculturated to the world of work and acquire marketable skills. With Job Path, developmentally disabled adults have the opportunity to live as fully-realized adults with real jobs and real independence. Job Path was spun-off from Vera in 1998.AuthorsProject Job Site34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
