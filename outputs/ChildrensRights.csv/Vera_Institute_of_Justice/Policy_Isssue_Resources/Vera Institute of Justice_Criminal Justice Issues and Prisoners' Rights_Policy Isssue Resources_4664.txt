This report looks at existing research to answer three questions:How does zero tolerance discipline affect individual students and the overall school environment?Have these policies helped create a school-to-prison pipeline?If the costs outweigh the benefits, are there more effective alternatives? The evidence concludes that neither adults nor young people have benefited from zero tolerance policies. In fact there is growing consensus that positive reinforcement is more effective, and behavioral problems should be resolved on a case-by-case basis.AuthorsJacob Kang-BrownJennifer TroneJennifer FratelloTarika Daftary-KapurKey TakeawayZero tolerance policies are beneficial for neither teachers nor students. We need alternatives that keep kids safely in school.Publication HighlightsNo studies have proven that an increase in student suspensions has led to a decrease in classroom disruption.Zero tolerance policies were initially designed to respond to possession of a weapon. However, in recent years, only five percent of suspensions or expulsions nationally were for this offense.Policies that require teachers or administrators to push students out of school can have life-long negative effects that severely limit a young person’s future potential.Key FactsThe number of secondaryschool students suspended or expelledin a single year increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 2010.Zero tolerance disproportionately affects minority students.Middle schools expelled black students at four times the rate of white students, and Latino students at two times the rate.Students with disabilities are also at risk.Studies show that high schools suspend or expel students with disabilities at three times the rate of students without disabilities.One longitudinal study showedthat students with one suspensionwere at 68 percent higher risk of dropping out of school than students who had not been suspended.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
