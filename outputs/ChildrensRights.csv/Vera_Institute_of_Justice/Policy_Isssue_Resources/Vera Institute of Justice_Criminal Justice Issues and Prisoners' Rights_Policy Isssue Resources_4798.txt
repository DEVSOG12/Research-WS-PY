Most alleged offenders are released on bail, and many courts lack the ability to ensure that they meet the conditions of release. It is also a time when accused batterers are most likely to try to influence the outcome of the case, often using threats and sometimes violence. This publication examines several steps the Milwaukee County Courts took to ensure that pretrial orders are met and that the safety of the accuser is considered. It is part of the Judicial Oversight Demonstration Initiative's four-part series Enhancing Responses to Domestic Violence.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
