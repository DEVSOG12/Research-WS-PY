Until recently, status offender systems regularly referred these youth to juvenile court, where they were subject to the same punitive interventions as youth charged with criminal activity. Today, a new paradigm for status offender services is emerging: refer at-risk young people and their families to social service programs in their communities and use the juvenile justice system as a last resort. Making Court the Last Resort: A New Focus for Supporting Families in Crisis, describes this new paradigm by highlighting successful status offender system reforms in Florida, New York, and Connecticut.AuthorsSara MogulescuGaspar Caro34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
