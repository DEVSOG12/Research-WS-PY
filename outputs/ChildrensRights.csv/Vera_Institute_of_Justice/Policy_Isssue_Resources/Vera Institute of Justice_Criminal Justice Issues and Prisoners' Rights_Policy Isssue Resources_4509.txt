Analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice and Dr. Jonathan Kringen of the University of New Haven, however, shows that there is no evidence to support claims that a highly-touted example of this tactic—Operation Streamline—had a deterrent effect.AuthorsMichael CorradiniLaura SimichKaren BerberichJonathan KringenMeredith EmighShow MoreKey TakeawayThe analysis reported here found no evidence to suggest that Operation Streamline had any impact on migrants’ decisions to enter the United States. Operation Streamline succeeded only in clogging federal courts, eroding due process, and incarcerating tens of thousands of people.Publication HighlightsPrior to Operation Streamline, federal criminal prosecution was reserved for the most serious immigration-related crimes and for people apprehended reentering the country after previously being deported.Operation Streamline was a policy that required, in most cases, the federal criminal prosecution of immigrants caught entering (even for the first time) or reentering the country without authorization.Under Operation Streamline, federal judges along the Southwest border saw their courts clogged with thousands of Streamline cases, and often conducted hearings with dozens of Streamline defendants at a time, raising serious due process concerns.Key FactsThe federal court system saw a 159 percent increase in total immigration cases between 2005—the first year of Operation Streamline—and 2013.People with legitimate claims to asylum wereprosecuted and deportedthrough Operation Streamline.Policies like Operation Streamline harm the emotional well-being of children,decrease the ability of adults to provide for them,and separate families from each other at significant economic and social cost.RelatedNEWSNew York Immigrant Family Unity Project lays groundwork for constitutional victoryDec 28, 2015PUBLICATIONEvaluation of the New York Immigrant Family Unity ProjectNov 09, 2017PUBLICATIONThe Flow of Unaccompanied Children through the Immigration SystemFeb 29, 201234 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
