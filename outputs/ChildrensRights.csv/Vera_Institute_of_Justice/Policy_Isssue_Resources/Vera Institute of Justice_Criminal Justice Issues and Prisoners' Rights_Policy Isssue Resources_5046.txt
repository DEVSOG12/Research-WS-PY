In 1983-84, Vera collaborated with the Inner London Probation and After-care Service (ILPAS) to develop two pilot projects—a London-based project provided disclosure of the statements of prosecution witnesses, and a Northumbria project focused on disclosure of a summary of the prosecution case. Drawing upon the results to date of the two pilots, and other available information, the paper also sets forth the major policy issues which must be determined in the course of implementing section 48.AuthorsFloyd Feeney34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
