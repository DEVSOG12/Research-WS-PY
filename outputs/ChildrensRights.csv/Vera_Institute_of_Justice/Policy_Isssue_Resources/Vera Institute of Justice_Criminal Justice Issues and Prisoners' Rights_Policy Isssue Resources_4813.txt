An expanding focus of national and multinational assistance involves criminal justice reform in policing, victim's rights, and judicial systems—as part of both development assistance and post-conflict assistance. For a larger study commissioned by the UK government to review existing work in the areas of safety and justice, this paper draws together lessons from the experiences of recent UK-funded policing and justice programs in seven countries: Afghanistan, India, Jamaica, Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
