On any given day, 7,000 people are detained pretrial at Rikers Island and other New York City jails because they cannot make bail. While judges in New York can choose up to nine different forms of bail at arraignment—including “alternative” forms that require little to no upfront payment—most judges choose to impose the two most onerous forms: cash bail and insurance bail bond.This report documents the outcomes of 99 cases in which two of these alternatives—partially secured and unsecured bonds—were set. The results suggest that expanding the use of alternatives forms of bail will offer more New Yorkers the opportunity to await trial without the harm to employment, housing, family, and overall stability that comes from pretrial detention.AuthorsInsha RahmanKey TakeawayVera’s analysis of a small cohort of cases tells a fascinating story of how a change in practice can potentially have a significant impact on reducing the use of pretrial detention without compromising public safety or rates of court appearance.Publication HighlightsVera analyzed 99 cases in which two different forms of alternative bail were set—unsecured and partially secured bond, which require little to no upfront payment to secure release.The analysis tracked all 99 cases over a nine- to 12-month period, documenting bail-making, court appearance, pretrial re-arrest, and final case disposition. Vera also conducted interviews with judges, defenders, and court staff.While 99 cases out of the thousands where bail is set is a miniscule number in the larger scheme of New York City’s bail system, this experiment illustrates the possibility of meaningful culture change.Key Facts68%of cases analyzed in this studymade bail. An additional 5% were released on recognizance.Those released had a combined court appearance rate of88%and a rate of pretrial re-arrest for new felony offenses of 8%.When released pretrial, the majority of cases resolved in a disposition less serious than the initial top charge at arraignment, with fully1/3ending in dismissal and another 20% ending in a non-criminal conviction.RelatedNEWSThere is no magic bullet to fixing bailAug 05, 2016NEWSChipping away at New York City's unjust and misguided bail systemApr 29, 2016PUBLICATIONNew York City's Pretrial Supervised Release ProgramApr 10, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
