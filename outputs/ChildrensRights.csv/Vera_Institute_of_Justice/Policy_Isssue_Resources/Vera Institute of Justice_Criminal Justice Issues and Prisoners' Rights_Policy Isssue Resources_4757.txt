Yet many youth leave more angry, fearful, or violent than when they entered. In September 2008, Governor David A. Paterson created the Task Force on Transforming Juvenile Justice to help the state shift toward a rehabilitative, treatment-focused model of care that promotes public safety, holds youth accountable for their actions, and produces positive outcomes for young people and their families. In this report, the Task Force offers its recommendations for reducing the use of institutional placement and expanding alternatives; eliminating inequities across the system, particularly those that disproportionately impact youth of color; improving the supports and services provided to young people in state custody and upon release; and ensuring system accountability and transparency.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
