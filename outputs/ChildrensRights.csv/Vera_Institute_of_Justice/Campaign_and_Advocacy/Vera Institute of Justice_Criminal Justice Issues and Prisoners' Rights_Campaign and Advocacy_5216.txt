In response to these issues, and with support from the Vera Institute of Justice and staff from the Governor’s Public Safety Subcabinet, Governor Bill Haslam created the Governor’s Task Force on Sentencing and Recidivism. The Vera report is an interim overview and analysis of the work of the task force as of June 2015, including impact projections from the recommendations on the Tennessee Department of Correction’s prison population, where available.AuthorsChristine HerrmanRebecca SilberSara SullivanElena VankoJessa WilcoxFormer Senior Program AssociateShow More34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
