The program began by serving formerly incarcerated transgender women, often of color, who experienced housing instability. While this program continues to focus on providing housing for women, we acknowledge that gender is often not binary in the LGBTQIA2S+ community. After establishing a partnership with local apartment owners, Black & Pink National provides the down payment, as well as two month’s rent for participants, which waives background and credit checks that often act as a barrier.General Inquiries​Black & Pink National is a national 501c3 organization based in Omaha, NE.2406 Fowler Ave Suite 316, Omaha, NE 68111admin@blackandpink.orgFacebook-fTwitterInstagramEnvelopeSign up to connect withBlack & Pink National!Black & Pink National is a prison abolitionist organization dedicated to abolishing the criminal punishment system and liberating LGBTQIA2S+ people and people living with HIV/AIDS who are affected by that system through advocacy, support, and organizing.Authorized Safe Housing Network PartnerCopyright ©2022 Black And Pink | Powered by Catapult Consulting SolutionsPrivacy PolicyTermsSitemapScroll to TopPlease join our annual Holiday Card Campaign & send some love & care to our incarcerated family this holiday season!Head over to this blog post or our PenPal Pairing Site to learn more and register today!
