For an incarcerated LGBTQIA2S+ person, corresponding with someone on a regular basis is itself a harm reduction strategy, giving that person a support network outside of prison.penpal programOur penpal program is where Black & Pink National all began. We have thousands of pairs that have joined us since the program first began in 2005.Check out our PenPal Pairing Site to learn more about how to be an awesome PenPal and to connect with our inside family!Read our release about the importance of our revamped PenPal Pairing Site (new as of November 2020)!Get startedwhy others became a penpalOur LGBTQ youth group wrote to a Black & Pink member and she was incredible. Her letters about organizing queer people in prison inspired the youth in their own organizing efforts. Her positive energy brought light to young people dealing with rejecting families and schools.I can't break prison walls, but I can write letters.As someone with disabilities and health issues that impede my ability to become involved in activism such as protests, I really desired a way to help people and was pointed towards this avenue. I really thought it would be an excellent way to (hopefully) help members of the LGBTQIA+ community who need it most. I grew up with an uncle in prison, and I know how far human connection goes to helping a person keep it together inside.PreviousNextBlack & Pink National NewsletterThe Black & Pink National Newsletter has been distributed free of charge to a rapidly growing list of incarcerated LGBTQIA2S+ members and incarcerated members living with HIV/AIDS around the country since 2010!
