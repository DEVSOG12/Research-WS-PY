In January 2016, the Pamunkey Indian Tribe’s Final Determination became effective as a result of the IBIA’s final dismissal of the request for reconsideration. The IBIA ruled that Stand Up for California, an organization that focuses on gambling issues affecting California, failed to show that it is an “interested party” to the Final Determination within the meaning of the Federal acknowledgment regulations, and was therefore not entitled to seek reconsideration of the Final Determination.The Pamunkey Indian Tribe is the only tribe located in Virginia to have filed a fully documented recognition petition. Established no later than 1646, the Tribe’s Reservation is located next to the Pamunkey River, and adjacent to King William County. The Reservation comprises approximately 1,200 acres and is the oldest inhabited Indian reservation in America. NARF represented the Tribe in this effort from 1988 to 2016.More CasesShareShare on FacebookTweetSend emailSign up for Latest NewsNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.ΔSupport Our workDonate Today!About UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual Reports & FinancialsNewsNARF NewsGet the LatestNARF Legal ReviewIndian Law News BulletinsOur WorkCases & ProjectsIssues & PrioritiesResources & PublicationsNational Indian Law LibrarySUPPORT USDonate OnlinePlanned GivingOnline StoreLog-In to Your AccountContact UsRequest HelpJoin Our TeamNative American Rights FundBoulder, CO (303) 447-8760Anchorage, AK (907) 276-0680Washington, DC (202) 785-4166Connect With UsFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinked InRSS feedDisclaimerPrivacy Policy© 2022 Native American Rights Fund
