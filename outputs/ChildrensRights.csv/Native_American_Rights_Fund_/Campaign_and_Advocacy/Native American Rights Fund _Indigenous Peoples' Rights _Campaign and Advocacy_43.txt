The guidelines were revised for the first time since their initial publication in 1979. With a stronger force of law than the guidelines, the proposed federal regulations explain how the agency intends to interpret the law and clarifies standards of practice that will be enforced. The BIA has never issued substantive regulations that directly pertain to ICWA implementation before this year.  The new guidelines and regulations address issues that states and agencies have grappled with for the past 36 years.NARF fully supports the proposed regulations, and we ask you to support them too.  It is time for you to have your voice heard on this historic issue.Here are four things that you can do help:#1. Submit your comments to the BIA by May 19th.  Comments can be submitted by email at comments@bia.gov.  Be sure to write “ICWA Regulations” in the subject line.
