However, abusive behavior can occur at any stage — including in teen dating relationships. In fact, it is estimated that 10 percent of teens are subjected to sexual violence or physical abuse in dating relationships. This is why February has been designated as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.Raising AwarenessParents, teachers, friends, and teenagers in relationships should all become more informed about the issues surrounding dating violence. There are many resources available to help all age groups, including Preventing and Responding to Teen Dating Violence and the Safety Planning Guide. These and other resources provide more in-depth information related to dating violence, the warning signs of abusive relationships, and how to provide or seek help.How to HelpParents and teachers can make a positive impact by talking with teens about warning signs of physical or emotional abuse, as well as the difference between healthy and abusive relationships. Teens who want to spread awareness in their community can join initiatives like the That’s Not Cool Ambassador Program. If you are concerned that a teen you know might be in an abusive relationship, help them connect with the National Dating Abuse Helpline, which can be reached by calling 1-866-331-9474 or by texting the phrase “loveis” to 77054.Teen dating violence may not be as well-known as other incidents of abusive relationships, but it is still a serious issue affecting all communities. By learning more about this form of sexual violence and taking a stand, you can help protect teens.Share this post:Share on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on EmailFilter By CategoryAbuseAbuse RelationshipAddictionAddiction ServicesCommunityCrisis HotlineDiversity, Equity, and InclusionDomestic AbuseDomestic ViolenceHousing SupportHuman RightsHuman TraffickingMental HealthOneEighty ServicesPreventionRecoverySexual AbuseSexual AssaultStalkingUncategorizedVolunteeringYouth and TeenFilter By CategoryFilter By CategorySelect CategoryAbuseAbuse RelationshipAddictionAddiction ServicesCommunityCrisis HotlineDiversity, Equity, and InclusionDomestic AbuseDomestic ViolenceHousing SupportHuman RightsHuman TraffickingMental HealthOneEighty ServicesPreventionRecoverySexual AbuseSexual AssaultStalkingUncategorizedVolunteeringYouth and TeenNewsletter Sign-UpStay tuned to the latest news, events, and inspiring stories – when you subscribe to the OneEighty Community eNewsletter.Stay Up to DatePosts navigation← Helping to Prevent Human TraffickingRaising Awareness of Alcohol Abuse →Newsletter sign upSignup for our Email NewsletterMake a PaymentMake a PaymentGet HelpAboutResourcesFor ClientsGet InvolvedNavigateGet HelpAboutResourcesFor ClientsGet InvolvedServicesAddiction & Substance UseResidential TreatmentDomestic Violence & Sexual AssaultMental Health CounselingCommunity Relations & PreventionRecovery CoachingHousing & SupportSelect a ServiceAddiction & Substance UseResidential TreatmentDomestic Violence & Sexual AssaultMental Health CounselingCommunity Relations & PreventionRecovery CoachingHousing & SupportLocationsDowntown Wooster104 Spink Street, Wooster, Ohio 44691Call the Wooster Downtown Location330-264-8498Call the Wooster Downtown Location330-264-3777Hearing or speech disabilityHearing or speech disability please call 711 to automatically connect to a telecommunications relay service (TRS) communication assistant.North End Wooster128 E.
