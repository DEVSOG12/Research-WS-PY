Even in Wayne County and Holmes County, these problems are more widespread than many people realize. This is why OneEighty offers prevention and education services — to help the entire community come together and achieve change.As valuable as it is for professional counselors and medical professionals to provide their services to victims of domestic violence and those struggling with addiction, success outside the program is only possible when the community as a whole is willing to lend its support. Quite often, however, this is hindered by false assumptions and negative stigmas.When community members are educated on these serious issues, they become more sympathetic to the plight of those around them. They become better equipped to identify those in need and provide appropriate support. Many even go on to participate in community coalitions, volunteering to serve those in recovery.Addiction and domestic violence aren’t going to disappear anytime soon. But as more people in the community spread awareness and provide support, it will become that much easier for those who are suffering to get treatment and care. Better yet, it will make prevention more achievable — and when this happens, the health and wellness of the entire community will improve.Share this post:Share on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on EmailFilter By CategoryAbuseAbuse RelationshipAddictionAddiction ServicesCommunityCrisis HotlineDiversity, Equity, and InclusionDomestic AbuseDomestic ViolenceHousing SupportHuman RightsHuman TraffickingMental HealthOneEighty ServicesPreventionRecoverySexual AbuseSexual AssaultStalkingUncategorizedVolunteeringYouth and TeenFilter By CategoryFilter By CategorySelect CategoryAbuseAbuse RelationshipAddictionAddiction ServicesCommunityCrisis HotlineDiversity, Equity, and InclusionDomestic AbuseDomestic ViolenceHousing SupportHuman RightsHuman TraffickingMental HealthOneEighty ServicesPreventionRecoverySexual AbuseSexual AssaultStalkingUncategorizedVolunteeringYouth and TeenNewsletter Sign-UpStay tuned to the latest news, events, and inspiring stories – when you subscribe to the OneEighty Community eNewsletter.Stay Up to DatePosts navigation← Knowing the Warning Signs of a StalkerThe Reality of Homelessness in the Winter →Newsletter sign upSignup for our Email NewsletterMake a PaymentMake a PaymentGet HelpAboutResourcesFor ClientsGet InvolvedNavigateGet HelpAboutResourcesFor ClientsGet InvolvedServicesAddiction & Substance UseResidential TreatmentDomestic Violence & Sexual AssaultMental Health CounselingCommunity Relations & PreventionRecovery CoachingHousing & SupportSelect a ServiceAddiction & Substance UseResidential TreatmentDomestic Violence & Sexual AssaultMental Health CounselingCommunity Relations & PreventionRecovery CoachingHousing & SupportLocationsDowntown Wooster104 Spink Street, Wooster, Ohio 44691Call the Wooster Downtown Location330-264-8498Call the Wooster Downtown Location330-264-3777Hearing or speech disabilityHearing or speech disability please call 711 to automatically connect to a telecommunications relay service (TRS) communication assistant.North End Wooster128 E.
