But for those in a violent or abusive relationship, it can be another harsh reminder of feeling boxed in, beat up, or the red marks that remain. We want to take this month to not only answer your questions about domestic violence but also share where help can be found in our community.What is domestic violence?Domestic violence, sometimes called battering, relationship abuse, or intimate partner violence, is a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence.What are the signs of domestic violence?Domestic violence can include physical abuse, emotional abuse, economic abuse, and sexual abuse. Sexual abuse batterers use threats, intimidation, isolation, and other behaviors to maintain power over their victims.Answering yes to any of these questions could be a sure sign of an unhealthy relationship:Are you in an abusive relationship? Are you in danger? Are you afraid of your partner? Does your partner threaten to hurt you? Does your partner control all the money? Has your partner ever pushed you, shoved you, thrown things at you, or forced you to have sex? Does your partner stalk you and show up uninvited at your job or when you’re out with friends?What is the domestic violence hotline?OneEighty Domestic Violence / Sexual Assault: 1-800-686-1122What can I do if I am in this type of relationship?
