By involving volunteers in research, education, and advocacy, we build broad constituencies in the United States and select global communities.Our VisionWe envision a world in which every person lives with dignity, freedom, justice, equality, and peace; and believe that every person has a part to play in building respect for human rights and expanding the human rights movement in the United States and around the world.Our ApproachThe Advocates for Human Rights believes that each one of us has a part to play in defending human rights. By engaging volunteers in hands-on human rights work, The Advocates not only accomplishes critical research and advocacy, we transform volunteers into advocates for human rights.The Advocates works on two levels: the systemic level and the individual direct services level. The Advocates' unique approach grounds policy work in the lived experiences of our partners and clients. When our clients experience injustice, we help them and advocate to change the systems that perpetuate those injustices. When our partners report barriers to safety and security, we identify the gaps in legal protections and develop solutions.Rooted in deep expertise and strong relationships, The Advocates works in our home community and in partnerships around the globe to address some of the most intractable human rights issues.Our HistoryThe Advocates for Human Rights started with a group of lawyers seeking to leverage Minnesota's unique spirit of social justice to promote and protect human rights worldwide. Since then our innovative programming has changed the lives of refugees and immigrants, women, ethnic and religious minorities, children, and other marginalized communities. We investigate and expose human rights violations, represent immigrants and refugees seeking asylum, train and assist groups that protect human rights, engage the public, policy-makers, and children; and push for legal reform and advocate for sound policy.Â The Advocates for Human Rights is an independent, non-partisan, 501(c)(3) non-governmental international human rights organization.MissionImpactLocation and HoursStaffBoard of DirectorsContactThe Advocates for Human Rights330 Second Avenue South, Suite 800Minneapolis, MN 55401Phone: 612-341-3302Immigrant Client Line: 612-341-9845Fax: 612-341-2971General Inquiries: hrights@advrights.orgMedia Inquiries: press@advrights.orgNavigateHomeLegal HelpGet InvolvedCareersPrioritiesResourcesAbout UsConnectFacebookInstagramTwitterYouTubeLinkedInNewsletter
