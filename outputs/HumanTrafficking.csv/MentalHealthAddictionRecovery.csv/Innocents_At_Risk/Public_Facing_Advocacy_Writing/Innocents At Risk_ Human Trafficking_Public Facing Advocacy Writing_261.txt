Over the course of the year, Innocents at Risk had the honor of hosting and attending numerous events that addressed ways to end the $150 billion global human trafficking industry that trades in children and women.On January 22, Innocents at Risk hosted a film screening of the movie SOLD at the George Town Club during Human Trafficking Awareness Month. The film detailed the danger and reality of a young girl determined to escape trafficking.On March 5, we hosted a screening of the movie SOLD at Washington Global Public Charter School.On May 6, the new ambassador of Trafficking in Persons at the U.S. Department of State, Ambassador John Richmond, addressed the Jones Day Event of Awareness and Building Partnerships.

Deborah Sigmund was on a panel with Alma Tucker, founder and president of International Network of Hearts, to discuss how human trafficking affects society today around the world. Being able to share the horrors of human trafficking allowed us to bring even more awareness of the issue to the diplomatic community.On Nov. 10, Innocents at Risk was pleased to partner with James Hawthorne and Flicks4Change at their 2nd Annual Socially Conscious Film Festival held at the Ronald Reagan Building. Watching meaningful short films about social change helped us connect with change makers who want to make a difference. It was an honor to speak on a panel about sex trafficking and socially related issues.Nov. 14 was one of the biggest events of the year — the launch of the Alliance to End Human Trafficking, hosted at the U.S. Capitol by Lynn Shaw, Blanquita Cullum, and Andi Buerger. It was an honor to be a partner and speak alongside members of Congress, law enforcement officials, dignitaries and other representatives of nonprofits to discuss how to end human trafficking. Innocents at Risk would like to thank Congressman Pete Olsen, Congresswoman Ann Wagner, Congressman Jim Costa, Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, Congressman Chip Roy, and Congressman Greg Walden for all of the hard work they are doing in Congress to prevent the $150 billion global trafficking industry from growing even larger than it is today!Looking ahead to 2020, Innocents at Risk will continue our partnerships with the United Nations, the D.C. Task Force Against Trafficking, the Global Sustainability Network, the Alliance to End Human Trafficking, and others to raise awareness and educate communities and schools in the Washington, D.C. area, the international and diplomatic community, the corporate sector, and the public to keep children and women safe everywhere.We’re excited about our upcoming Gala on April 21, 2020, at the Organization of American States to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of Innocents at Risk!

Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
