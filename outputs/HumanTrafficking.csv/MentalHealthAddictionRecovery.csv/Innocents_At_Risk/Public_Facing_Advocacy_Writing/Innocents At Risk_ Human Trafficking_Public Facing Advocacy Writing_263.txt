As 2013 D.C. Mother of the Year for American Mothers, Inc., I have been working with the organization to educate all the members of American Mothers and giving mothers of every state Information and training tools to help stop Human Trafficking. These remarkable women are doing incredible work to educate their communities about keeping children safe and preventing Child Trafficking! Thank you, American Mothers, for joining the Fight to End Child Trafficking!Innocents at Risk would like to thank one of our heroes in Congress, Congressman Chris Smith, for hosting a briefing with The DHS Blue Campaign, The Hotel Association, Uber, Air B&B, EPACT, and our partner, Airline Ambassadors. It is an exciting time to be working together to find solutions to Fight Human Trafficking. It’s really great to have Air B&B get on board to be aware, and report situations of possible Human Trafficking. The hotel industry has become a vital partner. Innocents at Risk continues to say, “We must turn millions of eyes everywhere to save innocent lives!”Airline Ambassadors held events to Empower Flight Crews in Bangkok and Geneva to watch for possible situations of trafficking and asking them: If You See Something, REPORT IT! It is also rewarding to hear from participants, flight crew, and airline employees of all the trainees of Airline Ambassadors and Innocents at Risk that those who have been educated and trained keep their eyes open and never forget the protocol! The Initiative is working and lives are being saved.This May, Innocents at Risk was pleased to partner with The Department of State and The Meridian International Center. Innocents at Risk was asked to host a Russian Delegation in our office. The delegation was made of organizations working to Fight Human Trafficking and was especially interested in our Training Flight Attendants in the U.S. and around the world for the purpose of preventing trafficking and saving lives. The delegation was very engaged and enjoyed our visit! The visit was organized by Amal Marcos, Senior Program Officer, Professional Exchange Division of The Meridian International Center. Innocents at Risk is grateful to Amal and The Meridian International Center for asking us to participate in this important educational project. Innocents at Risk is also grateful to the individuals from the Delegation who are doing their part to fight Human Trafficking!Thank you for your ongoing support!Happy June! Wishing you a very happy, safe Summer! Stay safe, keep your children safe and keep your eyes open while in airports, malls and all public places. Report anything suspicious you see to Law Enforcement, a Flight Attendant, an Airline Crew Member, or call 911. Thank you!Warmest Regards,Deborah SigmundFounder/DirectorInnocents at RiskNewer PostDepartment of State Releases 2018 Trafficking in Persons ReportOlder PostInnocents at Risk Fights the Scourge of Child TraffickingChild trafficking is happening in every corner of the world, in major cities and small towns, and in every state and province. Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
