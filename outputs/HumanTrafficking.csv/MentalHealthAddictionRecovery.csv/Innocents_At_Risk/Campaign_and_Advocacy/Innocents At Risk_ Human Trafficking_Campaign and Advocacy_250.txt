It plagues every country. The United States is one of the largest destination countries in the world. Victims are deceived into accepting a job offer that promises them a better life. Instead, they find themselves trapped in a cycle of physical and psychological abuse. They are prisoners who cannot escape. Their lives are full of pain, brutality, and despair.Human trafficking takes place in every country, from the richest to the poorest. According to the United Nations, over 130 countries are origin, transit, or destination countries for human trafficking. It feeds on the world’s most vulnerable women and children and is driven by the demand in affluent countries.Approximately 18,000 persons are trafficked into the United States from over 50 countries every year. Over 300,000 children are trafficked within the United States annually. U.S. children are trafficked to large urban centers such as Washington, D.C., New York and Los Angeles, as well as to main tourism destinations, including Las Vegas and Florida. The American girls and women that are trafficked come from big cities and small towns. They come from affluent, middle-class, and lower-income families, and from many ethnic backgrounds. They are recruited from malls, schools, youth centers, theme parks, neighborhoods, and online.Human trafficking is also about more than sex trafficking, according to a Department of Homeland Security Report entitled “Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking, the Importation of Goods Produced by Forced Labor And Child Sexual Exploitation.”“Globally, forced labor is estimated to be the predominant form of human trafficking, far more prevalent than sex trafficking,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported.Human trafficking is a health, security, and moral issue. It erodes our political systems. It harms our communities. It endangers the lives and well-being of those who become victims, and it could be taking place right next door to you. Since it thrives in secrecy, the more you know, the more you can do to prevent it.WHO ARE THE CHILDREN TRAFFICKED FOR SEX?By Linda Smith, founder of Shared Hope International As the sun sets across the United States tonight, thousands of children are rising to meet the night.They should be in safe homes, in warm beds, being tucked beneath blankets and told bedtime stories.Instead they slip into the nocturnal world, dressed for the work of the “track.”All over the United States, these children are being exploited. In Atlanta, Detroit, New York, Kansas City, New Orleans, Seattle, Anchorage, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Denver — in every major city, in the small towns, at truck stops in every state of the Union, they’re being put to “work.”People say it’s their fault, but I don’t think so anymore.People call them “bad kids,” but I don’t think so anymore.People say they like it, some say they deserve it. I don’t think so.The Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that each year at least 300,000 children are the human “products” meeting the demand of the sex-trafficking industry in the U.S. alone. Around the world, more than one million children are subjected to human trafficking for sex or porn. The industry is estimated to bring in $9.5 billion annually.The statistics are staggering, but it’s the individual stories that are heartbreaking. These are girls as young as 11. Girls who haven’t reached puberty. Children who should be in fifth grade. Many have never attended a school dance. Never learned how to use a locker. Never pondered a class schedule.Their skin is of every color. Some come from “good homes” and have families searching desperately for them. Others are runaways, or children in foster care, who have already been victimized and traumatized within the walls of their homes — and have no one searching for them.They are America’s children. They’re our neighbors. They’re our children’s classmates. They’re in our very homes.They are our children. We must save them.- From the book Renting Lacy: A Story of America’s Prostituted Children (A Call to Action)THE BASICSHuman trafficking is a $150 billion industry annually. In the D.C. Metropolitan area specifically, it is a $100 Million business each year.The money from this illicit industry fuels organized crime and terrorist networks worldwide.There are more slaves in the world today than in any time in historyThere are 27 million slaves today, which is more than the number of slaves in all 400 years of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade combined.Each year over 2 million women and children are sold into slavery and within the U.S. over 300,000 annually.Human trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal industry in the world, second only to the drug trade.Human trafficking is more lucrative than the illegal arms trade.One victim is trafficked across international borders every minute.Human trafficking is happening everywhere in the world, and in our own country.It only takes a few seconds to kidnap a child – but years to prosecute the trafficker.Boys and girls are recruited, coerced or taken from airports, train stations, malls, schools, parks, youth centers, and theme parks.The U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime, in a 2020 Global Report on Trafficking in Human Persons, says:• 51% of identified victims are women, 28% children and 21% men.• 72% of sex exploitation victims are women.• 63% of identified traffickers are men while 37% are women.• 43% of victims are trafficked domestically within national borders.STORY FROM A SMALL TOWNBy Kathie TruittLet me tell you a story. I come from a small, southern town in SW Missouri near the Arkansas line. El Dorado Springs is the most perfect, idyllic, closest-thing-to-Mayberry you can possibly imagine. With a total population of 3,000, I can attest to the fact that I had a story-book childhood.About six months ago my mother told me that the town’s postmaster, along with three other men, had been indicted on sex-trafficking charges. This man and his family had taken in a mentally challenged young girl. From the time she was 15 years old her new “father” took her from southwest Missouri all the way to Las Vegas and every point in between. She was made to sign a contract that she would work for him and be passed around to whomever wanted to pay the money. For a certain amount, men could have sex with her, or watch while she was used by others, or, if they wanted to pay extra, they could watch while she was tortured. It was during one of these torture sessions that these men were caught. Apparently during one of the ‘electrical torture sessions’ she lost consciousness and her heart stopped beating. Rather than lose their ‘cash cow’ they rushed her to the emergency room. It was there that this girl told her story to the paramedics and doctors treating her. Needless to say, these men are spending the rest of their lives behind bars, but not before they had made a quarter of a million dollars off of her.Trust me, if this can happen in Mayberry, in the middle of The Ozarks, smack dab in the middle of the Bible Belt, it can happen anywhere!Child trafficking is happening in every corner of the world, in major cities and small towns, and in every state and province. Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
