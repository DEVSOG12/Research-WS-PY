The selling of bodies of women and children is the fastest-growing industry in the world and an incredibly lucrative criminal industry, second only to drug trafficking.“To see but not to see,To see but to deny,To see but not to act is a crime against a child.You can all do something.You can make a difference.Save a child.”— Queen Silvia of SwedenAccording to the Department of State, 2 million women and children are victims of human trafficking every year. In the United States, 300,000 children are forced into child prostitution and child pornography each year. In Washington, D.C., alone, trafficking innocent children is a $100 million industry. Innocents at Risk is a child-advocacy non-for-profit 501 (c)(3) organization established to fight human trafficking by raising awareness and educating the international and diplomatic community, the corporate sector, students in public schools and universities, and the general public about this problem. We also work with flight attendants, who are our first line of defense in spotting and reporting traffickers. We are dedicated to protecting children from all forms of abuse, and work to end child exploitation and child trafficking everywhere.Child trafficking is happening in every corner of the world, in major cities and small towns, and in every state and province. Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
