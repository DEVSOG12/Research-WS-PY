All month long, coalition members and StarkMHAR staff will share education about suicide, how to reach out to others, and how to support those who have lost someone to suicide. Traditionally an awareness walk is held each year; these online connection efforts and other outreach will take its place for 2020.While suicide prevention efforts can sometimes be viewed as reserved for clinicians or the medical community, everyone has a role to play. “Checking in” frequently on someone who may be struggling can help create feelings of connectedness and hope; it’s important to be aware of the resources available so if they are needed, they are known.
