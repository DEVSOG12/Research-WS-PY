With support from the Sisters of Charity Foundation of Canton, Stark County Mental Health & Addiction Recovery (StarkMHAR) is currently working with The University of Akron and will be hosting an on-site MSW (Master of Social Work) cohort beginning in the fall of 2019.“We are fortunate to have a partner like the Sisters of Charity Foundation in Stark County, where we are in near constant communication about the changing needs of our community,” said John Aller, executive director of StarkMHAR. “One opportunity we see is the need to expand, diversify, and strengthen the behavioral health professionals available to our residents. Through support from the Foundation and other partners, we’re taking steps to make that happen.”In addition, StarkMHAR is working with Walsh University and Kent State University around expanding access to psychiatric services through Advanced Practice Nurses trained in behavioral health; additional efforts are also underway to enhance recruitment and retention of existing behavioral health staff.“The benefits of this initiative will be exponential,” said Joni T. Close, President of the Sisters of Charity Foundation of Canton. “Working professionals will have advanced education that fits into their lives, Stark County will attract and retain dedicated workers, and ultimately, those who need services will have better access. It’s an ideal partnership that touches on several needs in our county.”Support for these projects is through a braided stream of funding that includes the Sisters of Charity Foundation of Canton, OhioMeansJobs and StarkMHAR. The second phase of the project will include a focus area of fiscal, billing, and administrative support and is currently beginning.About Stark County Mental Health & Addiction RecoveryStark County Mental Health & Addiction Recovery is a multi-faceted organization of expert professionals, dedicated volunteers and concerned community leaders close to mental health and addiction needs right here at home.

I started school off and on trying to get my GED. Just knowing that I don’t have to worry about not having a roof over my head, and if I fall, you know, they not just going to throw me out… You know, they’re going to still give me a chance, you know, to try to help me, you know, get back upon my feet. So it feels good to be able to go home in my own apartment – my own space – through ICAN.Gloria, Stark County residentjoin the conversationFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubee-NewsSERVING STARK COUNTY RESIDENTSA multi-faceted county behavioral health board comprised of expert professionals, dedicated volunteers and concerned community leaders, Stark County Mental Health & Addiction Recovery (StarkMHAR) believes in hope, wellness and recovery for everyone.Drug Free Stark CountyProject DAWNPartnerSolutionsOpiate Task ForceSuicide Prevention CoalitionYouth Led PreventionYouth MOVEHomeless ContinuumBOARD PARTNERSOhio Association of County Behavioral Health AuthoritiesThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services AdministrationOpportunities For Ohioans With DisabilitiesOhio Department of Mental Health & Addiction ServicesCONTACT USStark County Mental Health & Addiction Recovery121 Cleveland Avenue SW | Canton, Ohio 44702Tel 330-455-6644 | Fax 330-455-4242Quick LinksContact UsJobsOpiate ToolkitStarkHelpCentral.comPrivacy PolicyHow are you feeling today?© 2022 Stark County Mental Health & Addiction RecoverySite design by Blackbaud
