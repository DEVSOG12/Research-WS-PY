I felt defeated. The first day I arrived at Next Step, I was swinging. I was so angry. I was lost, hurt, and confused. I was living in paralyzing fear; yet, this place, these people, accepted me... They have shown me that a new life is possible. The staff here helps me grow into a better man every day... I owe the person I am today to Next Step's guidance."J.C.,Beloved Client"Next Step Recovery is a safe place with people I not only consider a great staff, but also have come to love as family. They treated me with love, compassion, and respect. They helped me see things I couldn't; helped me grow as a person and changed my perspective on many topics. The people at Next Step will forever hold a special place in my heart."B.D.,Beloved Resident“This is the longest I have ever been clean and Next Step is the reason for that. It has provided me with a safe place to begin my recovery”T.A.,Beloved Resident"IOP was the perfect activity to both keep my week busy while also being able to fully focus on my recovery. The top notch staff members and therapists made this 12 week program one I will take with me wherever I go."L.M.,Beloved Resident"I am so grateful for Nextstep and all the staff members. This is definitely the place I needed to come after I got out of treatment. Here I got connected to the recovery community in Asheville and made some good friends here at the houses. Nextstep has not only taught me what I need to do to stay clean but I have learned so many life lessons while I was here. I will stay in contact with Nextstep because this place has given me my life back and for that I am so grateful!"Z.A.,Beloved Resident"Next Step Recovery was exactly what I needed in the early stages of my recovery! I spent so many years of my life hiding behind a bottle, and I couldn’t take it anymore! Susan and her staff helped me to get back on my feet and start the process moving on and loving life without the use of alcohol or drugs. After my 3 months here with next step, I chose to stay in Asheville and continue to work on my self, with their guidance. I couldn’t imagine my life today if I was still stuck in my old ways, Thank you Next Step Recovery!"Z.B.,Beloved Client"You may have to leave family, friends and your old life behind as you start recovery. Next Step provides not only a home for you to start over, it gives you a spiritual cleansing. From the staff to my housemates, Next Step has brought a new meaning to recovery. If you let them work with you, you'll find more than a recovery house, you'll find yourself again."M.R.K.,Beloved ResidentMy son completed 3 months of sober living at Next Steps Recovery, surrounded by kind, caring and compassionate staff, with all the skill sets required of true professionals to guide and assist him in living a productive, healthy , sober and happy life. He flourished and started to smile and enjoy life again during those three months. He now is starting to build a career for himself and is enjoying the normal things in life that had been missing for so many years. As a family we have been blessed to have been connected with Next Step Recovery. Thank you.K.W.,Family MemberPreviousNextReviewed by Susan StaderMS, LCMH, LCAS, CCSSusan Stader is the founder and director of Next Step Recovery and NSR of Asheville, an Intensive Outpatient Program and a Long-term Extended Care program in Asheville, NC. She received her Master’s in Community Counseling in 2004 at Western Carolina University and went on to get her licensure in addictions and mental health counseling. Susan believes that treatment should be gender-specific and offered in a small setting. Small recovery communities, such as hers, are more intimate and more effective in overall client satisfaction and care.Ready for the Next Step?Recovery is the Real Adventure.  Embrace the journey with othermen on the same path.  Lean on Next Step as your support network as you work toward sustainable sobriety.  You don’t have to make the climb back to a life of meaning by yourself, but you do have to start.  Take the next step toward your future today.Get StartedCall NowSubscribe to our newsletter and stay up to dateEmailSubscribePolicies & FormsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyProgram PoliciesForms & ManualsCode of EthicsMenuTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyProgram PoliciesForms & ManualsCode of EthicsQuicklinksPayment PortalIntensive Outpatient Program (IOP)Relapse Prevention & Aftercare SupportNSR of Asheville Extended Care LivingDonate to NSR of AshevilleMenuPayment PortalIntensive Outpatient Program (IOP)Relapse Prevention & Aftercare SupportNSR of Asheville Extended Care LivingDonate to NSR of AshevilleStart Your Recovery JourneyWhy Choose UsHow to Get StartedFamily & Friend ReferralsProfessional Referral SourcesApplicationSchedule ConsultationMenuWhy Choose UsHow to Get StartedFamily & Friend ReferralsProfessional Referral SourcesApplicationSchedule Consultation© 2022 All Rights Reserved Next Step Recovery | Get Your Loved One to Rehab | Areas We ServiceCall (828) 350-9960Take the Next Step in Your RecoveryOur goal is to help you overcome your addiction and develop the tools you need for a sustainable recovery.
