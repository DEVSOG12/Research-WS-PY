It is not a crime that occurs in an instant, like a kidnapping or carjacking, that a bystander can witness and report. In fact, many people in active sex trafficking situations do not recognize themselves as being victims because they have been expertly groomed by a trafficker to believe they have chosen to participate in commercial sex. Understanding how sex trafficking really works can help families and communities to recognize vulnerable people before they become victims and provide survivors with the support they need to break free, heal and move on with their lives.MythOnly women and girls can be victims and survivors of sex trafficking.Learn MoreRealityMen and boys are also victimized by sex traffickers.
