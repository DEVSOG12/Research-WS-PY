Significant risk factors include recent migration or relocation, substance use, mental health concerns, involvement with the child welfare system and being a runaway or homeless youth. Often, traffickers identify and leverage their victims’ vulnerabilities in order to create dependency.Learn MoreWho are the traffickers?Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives.How do traffickers control victims?Traffickers employ a variety of control tactics, the most common include physical and emotional abuse and threats, isolation from friends and family, and economic abuse. They make promises aimed at addressing the needs of their target in order to impose control. As a result, victims become trapped and fear leaving for myriad reasons, including psychological trauma, shame, emotional attachment, or physical threats to themselves or their family.Learn MoreWho are the survivors?Victims and survivors of human trafficking represent every race and ethnicity but some forms of trafficking are more likely to affect specific ethnic groups.Learn MoreHuman Trafficking MythsMythHuman trafficking is always or usually a violent crime.Learn MoreRealityThe most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor.MythAll human trafficking involves sex.Learn MoreRealityHuman trafficking is the use of force, fraud or coercion to get another person to provide labor or commercial sex. Worldwide, experts believe there are more situations of labor trafficking than of sex trafficking, but there is much wider awareness of sex trafficking in the U.S. than of labor trafficking.MythTraffickers target victims they don’t know.Learn MoreRealityMany survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents.MythOnly undocumented foreign nationals get trafficked in the United States.Learn MoreRealityPolaris has worked on thousands of cases of trafficking involving foreign national survivors who are legally living and/or working in the United States. These include survivors of both sex and labor trafficking.MythOnly women and girls can be victims and survivors of sex trafficking.Learn MoreRealityMen and boys are also victimized by sex traffickers. LGBTQ boys and young men are seen as particularly vulnerable to trafficking.MythHuman trafficking only happens in illegal or underground industries.Learn MoreRealityHuman trafficking cases have been reported and prosecuted in industries including restaurants, cleaning services, construction, factories and more.MythHuman trafficking involves moving, traveling or transporting a person across state or national borders.Learn MoreRealityHuman trafficking is often confused with human smuggling, which involves illegal border crossings. In fact, the crime of human trafficking does not require any movement whatsoever. Survivors can be recruited and trafficked in their own home towns, even their own homes.MythIf the trafficked person consented to be in their initial situation, then it cannot be human trafficking or against their will because they “knew better.”Learn MoreRealityInitial consent to commercial sex or a labor setting prior to acts of force, fraud, or coercion (or if the victim is a minor in a sex trafficking situation) is not relevant to the crime, nor is payment.MythPeople being trafficked are physically unable to leave their situations/locked in/held against their will.Learn MoreRealityThat is sometimes the case. More often, however, people in trafficking situations stay for reasons that are more complicated. Some lack the basic necessities to physically get out – such as transportation or a safe place to live. Some are afraid for their safety. Some have been so effectively manipulated that they do not identify at that point as being under the control of another person.MythLabor trafficking is only or primarily a problem in developing countries.Learn MoreRealityLabor trafficking occurs in the United States and in other developed countries but is reported at lower rates than sex trafficking.MythAll commercial sex is human trafficking.Learn MoreRealityAll commercial sex involving a minor is legally considered human trafficking. Commercial sex involving an adult is human trafficking if the person providing commercial sex is doing so against his or her will as a result of force, fraud or coercion.MythPeople in active trafficking situations always want help getting out.Learn MoreRealityEvery trafficking situation is unique and self-identification as a trafficking victim or survivor happens along a continuum. Fear, isolation, guilt, shame, misplaced loyalty and expert manipulation are among the many factors that may keep a person from seeking help or identifying as a victim even if they are, in fact, being actively trafficked.StatisticsIn 2020, 10,583 situations of human trafficking were reported to the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline involving 16,658 individual victims. Shocking as these numbers are, they are likely only a fraction of the actual problem.2020 StatisticsLocations of human trafficking situations in the United States in 2020.Additional InformationChild Sex TraffickingIn complex and frightening times, it’s natural that the world seems like a more dangerous place for our children than ever before.
