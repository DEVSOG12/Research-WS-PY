That may come as a surprise – especially if you have been to a training where you have been taught the ‘signs’ or indicators of trafficking, such as a person looking disheveled, upset or scared. But as we learn more about how trafficking really works, we are also learning that the best way to help is to pay attention to people you actually know or interact with – your students, your tenants, your children, your patients, your co-workers. It is all about two magic words: Context and proximity.Human Trafficking TrainingVulnerabilities and RecruitmentWho is most vulnerable? “It can happen to anyone,” and “it’s happening in your backyard,” are common in the anti human trafficking field.

People who work in certain industries, for example, may be more likely to spot signs of trafficking that are specific to the way that industry operates. Below are resources specific to either the type of trafficking or to how trafficking situations may intersect with certain kinds of systems and industries.  The U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline does not report to law enforcement in situations involving adults without permission from the person contacting the Trafficking Hotline.

That means health care providers are often in the position to recognize that something is wrong and take steps to provide support. Potential red flags specific to a health care setting may include:A patient with reproductive or sexual health concerns and or potential signs of sexual violence and reporting an unusually high number of partnersA patient with work-related injuries reporting that health and safety gear were not provided or conditions were otherwise unsafeA patient is unwilling or hesitant to answer questions about the injury or illnessA patient Is accompanied by an individual who does not let the patient speak for themselves, refuses to let the patient have privacy, or who interprets for themLearn moreHotels & Motels×Hotels and motels are common venues for both prostitution and sex trafficking, and it can be difficult to distinguish between the two, which is why it is important that concerns about potential trafficking be reported to the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline rather than directly to law enforcement, which could lead to arrests. Labor trafficking also takes place, where contract workers such as housekeepers may be exploited. They are also common venues for traveling sales crews to house trafficked workers. Below are some potential indicators of sex and/or labor trafficking that may also be indicators of prostitution.Presence of a third party (pimp/trafficker) appearing to be monitoring a hallway or doorGuest is overly concerned with surveillance cameras or entrance policiesSomeone is dropped off and visits for 30 minutes – 1 hour only – or someone waits for that person on property or in the parking lotAbandoned or locked out young adults on propertySales flyers left behind that detail suspicious magazine sales tacticsLearn moreTrucking×Sex traffickers often set up shop in and around truck stops in hopes of capitalizing on a potential customer base. Truckers Against Trafficking offers in-depth trainings for trucking personnel and more recently for professionals in the bussing industry.Learn moreNannies, House Cleaners, Home Health Aides×Nannies, house cleaners, and home health aides labor in isolated conditions that put them at risk for trafficking. The vulnerability can be compounded by the fact that many domestic workers are immigrants who may not know their rights in this country. Indicators of potential concern include:A live-in domestic worker who sleeps on a floor, in a garage, closet, laundry room or another place not intended for sleepingAn immigrant worker whose employer is holding her or his passport or other legal documentationA worker who is rarely or never allowed to leave the home, or only allowed out/seen in the company of the employerAn employer who sets up and controls a domestic workers’ bank accountLearn moreFamilial Trafficking×Educators and social services professionals may be in a good position to learn about trafficking situations and help connect victims to services. At least one international study found that almost half of identified child trafficking cases globally began with the involvement of a family member. Victims are sold for sex or forced to work in family businesses. Familial trafficking often goes undetected. While familial trafficking can and does happen in families that appear entirely “functional” or “normal” to an outsider, there may well also be signs of other kinds of child abuse or neglect – which may, in fact, include trafficking. The American Academy of Pediatrics offers information about recognizing child abuse more generally.Learn moreAgriculture, Forestry, and Construction×The majority of labor trafficking cases learned about on the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline involve immigrants, many of whom are in the United States on legal temporary work visas, some of which require that employers provide housing. In general, housing and similar living/working conditions may be the best indications available that something is not right in the workplace. Examples might include:Workers living in too-close quarters such as too many people in a single bedroom apartment who all work in a particular restaurant or storeWorkers living in/sleeping at construction sitesWorkers living in unsanitary conditions such as on a school bus with no running water in a farm labor situationLearn more
