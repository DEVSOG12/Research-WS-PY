An examination of the number of daily situations of sex trafficking reported to the Trafficking Hotline indicates a possible shift in where likely sex trafficking involving online sexual exploitation was happening during the pandemic. This in turn highlights how traffickers quickly adapt to changing contexts and the challenges and opportunities this poses to those trying to reduce and prevent sex trafficking.CategoriesCoronavirusSex TraffickingSocial Media/OnlineTrafficking HotlineMore ResourcesAction Guide: Trafficking Prevention for LGBTQ+ Communities in San DiegoLearn MoreLabor Trafficking On Specific Temporary Work Visas ReportLearn MoreThe Future of Human Rights on web3Learn MoreSign up to learn more about how you can helpOne moment please...Thank you for subscribing!EmailFollow usContactMediaBlogAboutPrivacy Policy2022 | Polaris is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization- please donate now.* Message and data rates may apply.
