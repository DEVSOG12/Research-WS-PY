In the years since, Congress has built on this foundation, honing and expanding the U.S. strategy to combat sex trafficking and labor trafficking through a holistic, multi-agency approach. Polaris works with allies to shape, support and share innovative state, federal and local laws and policies that are driven by data, based on survivor experience and focused on expanding accountability for sex and labor trafficking.Congressional PrioritiesThe Trafficking Victims Protection ActThe Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 2000, is the national framework for the federal response to human trafficking. The law has been reauthorized and updated, five times, most recently in January 2019 with strong bipartisan support. In FY19, Congress appropriated $250 million toward these efforts. The TVPA is based on a three-pronged “3P” approach to fighting sex trafficking and labor trafficking – prevention, prosecution, protection.Learn MoreFederal Anti-Trafficking AgenciesResponsibility for human trafficking is spread across federal agencies. For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigates the bulk of sex and labor trafficking cases involving foreign nationals, while the FBI takes the lead on investigating domestic minor sex trafficking cases through their Innocence Lost Initiative. The Justice Department leads federal prosecutions and funds state and local law enforcement agencies to form human trafficking task forces. Social services, awareness-raising, and prevention activities are also funded by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  HHS also funds the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline.Doing Business with the Federal GovernmentRules governing how the federal government spends money allow prohibit contracting with anyone engaged in human trafficking. The rules also require that anyone with a federal contract for more than $500,000 of goods or services have a plan in place to prevent trafficking. Federal contractors also have to certify that to the best of their knowledge their supply chain had not engaged in any trafficking-related activities. FAR 22.1704 provides the United States Government’s recourse in the event of a violation. FAR 52.222-50 outlines the United States Government’s zero-tolerance policy with regard to trafficking in persons.Supply Chain ProtectionsSeveral federal laws are designed to reduce the profit motive for labor trafficking by barring import of goods made with trafficked labor. Customs and Facilitations and Trade Enforcement Act amended the prohibition on importing goods made with trafficked labor. Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits importing goods made with forced or indentured labor.Additional ResourcesProvide Protections for Guest WorkersProtect Guest WorkersReauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection ActLearn MoreState Ratings on Human Trafficking LawsLearn MoreState Report Cards: Grading Criminal Record Relief Laws for Survivors of Human TraffickingLearn MoreHow Prosecutors Get Creative to Bring Traffickers to JusticeLearn MoreHidden in Plain Sight: How Corporate Secrecy Facilitates Human Trafficking in Illicit Massage ParlorsLearn MoreModel Legislation and Issue BriefsLearn MoreCongress: Step it Up this Human Trafficking Awareness DayLearn MoreEight Decades Later, Congress Closes Loophole that Allowed Slave-Made Products into the USLearn MoreDear Congress, #DontCutVOCALearn MoreNew Legislation Introduced to Improve Integrity of Trafficking in Persons ReportLearn MoreHouse Introduces New Legislation on Health Care and Human TraffickingLearn MoreSign up to learn more about how you can helpOne moment please...Thank you for subscribing!EmailFollow usContactMediaBlogAboutPrivacy Policy2022 | Polaris is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization- please donate now.* Message and data rates may apply.
