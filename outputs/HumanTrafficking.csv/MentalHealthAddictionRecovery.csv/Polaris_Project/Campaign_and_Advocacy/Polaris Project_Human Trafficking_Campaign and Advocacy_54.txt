You can contact your elected representatives about supporting important legislation to combat the crime and help survivors. You can learn more about how human trafficking really works and help educate others. And you can volunteer in your community to fight not just trafficking but the factors that lead to trafficking – including poverty, addiction and hopelessness.Help Disrupt Human Trafficking NetworksIt is too easy for criminal networks to hide their true identity when setting up illicit companies. Attorneys, accountants, and others that work for these companies are currently exempt from having to ensure their clients are operating within the law. Congress has the power to close this loophole by passing the bipartisan ENABLERS Act and help ensure they are not enabling human trafficking.Disrupt Criminal NetworksFederal Criminal Records Relief for SurvivorsBy its very definition, the crime of human trafficking involves being forced, manipulated or tricked into activities that a person would not otherwise engage in – such as selling sex or picking vegetables for hours in the hot sun with no pay. Yet the federal government has no mechanism to ensure that people who have federal criminal charges on their records as a result of their victimization can get those records cleared and move on with their lives. This is long overdue. Tell Congress: Federal criminalized trafficking victims deserve relief.Support SurvivorsRaise Awareness About Trafficking and GroomingUnderstanding the realities of how love is often used as a weapon in situations of human trafficking is critical to preventing it.
