There’s no obvious roadmap for this work, but our detailed analysis of how trafficking operations work in the United States and how they intersect with the legitimate worlds of business, finance, government and society, helped us focus on how we can have the greatest impact.REDUCE SEX TRAFFICKING IN 25 U.S. CITIESEND LABOR TRAFFICKING OF MIGRANT GUEST WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATESEQUIP THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SECTOR TO DISRUPT TRAFFICKINGEnding human trafficking means tackling the underlying patterns of exploitation so that we prevent trafficking before it starts, and fundamentally changing the power dynamics that allow it to happen.How We Do ItOur approach recognizes that human trafficking doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It is the predictable end result of social, political and economic inequities and injustices that leave some people in a position to exploit others. Rather than tackling those individual situations of trafficking, one at a time, we want to fundamentally reduce the amount of trafficking by reforming – and in some cases entirely – upending the failed systems that allow it to thrive – poverty, gender discrimination, lack of worker protections, failed social safety nets and child welfare systems, to name but a few.Big Fight on Sex TraffickingIf we want to end sex trafficking, we have to make sure that people have the things they need – money, love, safety, hope – so they do not have missing pieces in their lives. Because if there is a missing piece in a person’s life a trafficker will promise to fill it.Learn MoreBig Fight on Labor TraffickingOur economy relies on workers from around the world who come here to take jobs American businesses say they can’t fill otherwise. It’s time to enforce our own rules and protect their rights.Learn MoreBig Fight on Financial SystemsBy partnering with anti-money laundering professionals and financial services businesses, we will substantially improve the way trafficking is investigated and prosecuted – and in doing so, make trafficking less profitable and more dangerous than ever for the traffickers.Learn MoreSign up to learn more about how you can helpOne moment please...Thank you for subscribing!EmailFollow usContactMediaBlogAboutPrivacy Policy2022 | Polaris is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization- please donate now.* Message and data rates may apply.
