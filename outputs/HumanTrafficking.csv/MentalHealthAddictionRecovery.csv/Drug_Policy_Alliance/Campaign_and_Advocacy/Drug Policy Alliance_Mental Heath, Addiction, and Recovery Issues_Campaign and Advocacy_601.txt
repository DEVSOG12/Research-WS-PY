Tell Congress: Support the CARE Act to Prevent Overdose & Save Lives | Drug Policy AllianceSkip to main contentTell Congress: Support the CARE Act to Prevent Overdose & Save LivesOverdose deaths are preventable. Yet more than 70,000 people died from accidental drug overdoses across the country in 2017 alone. Now Members of Congress are finally taking steps to save lives.The CARE Act will give communities across the country the critical resources they need to address the overdose crisis. It would provide $100 billion in federal funding over ten years to help state and local governments combat these needless deaths, and provide evidence-based treatment, recovery and harm reduction services including expanding access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone.This is an opportunity to shift federal priorities where they belong – away from punitive policies to health-based solutions that will save lives. Tell your lawmakers to support the CARE Act and prevent needless overdose deaths.Take ActionYour MessageSubjectDear Member of Congress,Message BodyI am writing to urge you to cosponsor the Comprehensive Addiction Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which was introduced today by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Elijah Cummings.The CARE Act commits $100 billion over ten years to help communities scale up evidence-based responses to the overdose crisis, including effective treatment, harm reduction and early intervention and support services crucial to ending the overdose crisis.In 2017, more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses across the country, the highest death toll from drug overdoses ever recorded in the United States.Our nation has not seen a public health crisis of this scale since the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Congress responded to the HIV/AIDS crisis by passing the Ryan White CARE Act.Upon enactment, the Ryan White CARE Act immediately implemented the largest federal program focused exclusively on HIV care, treatment and support services, and is widely credited for helping to scale down the HIV/AIDS crisis.The CARE Act is modeled on this Ryan White approach by similarly boosting local efforts to prevent, treat and reduce harms associated with the overdose crisis, while enabling local health officials and other stakeholders to make determinations about priorities and resource allocation.The CARE Act would also provide sustained support to harm reduction services, including $500 million per year to expand access to naloxone in community settings, critically important to saving lives.For decades, Congress has poured billions of dollars into incarcerating and policing drug offenders. However, our nation’s overdose crisis underscores that punitive approaches to drugs fail to reduce substance use and overdose risk. The CARE Act would help shift federal resource priorities where they belong, supporting health-centered and evidence-based approaches to substance use disorder and the overdose crisis.The introduction of the CARE Act comes at a critical time when communities across the country are racing to save lives and end the overdose crisis. Please cosponsor this legislation to save lives.Sincerely,[First Name] [Last Name][Your Address]Your InformationSalutation *- Select -MrMrsMsMissDrFirst name *Last name *E-mail address *Address *Address Line 2City *State *- Select -AlabamaAlaskaAmerican SamoaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDistrict of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaGuamHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarshall IslandsMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaNorthern Marianas IslandsOhioOklahomaOregonPalauPennsylvaniaPuerto RicoRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirgin IslandsVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingZip Code *Phone* Drug Policy Alliance is committed to protecting your privacy and will never share your email address.If you sign and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.If you take action and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.If you donate and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.SiteMapContactUsTerms& ConditionsPrivacyPolicy
