Decriminalize Drugs and Dismantle the Drug War | Drug Policy AllianceSkip to main contentTake ActionDecriminalize Drugs and Dismantle the Drug WarThis month marks the 50th anniversary of President Nixon declaring a “war on drugs” which was deliberately waged to target Asian, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people.Today the roots of the drug war are everywhere. Millions of people have been criminalized and punished and drug possession is the most arrested offense in the country.Ending these arrests – by decriminalizing all drugs – is the most critical step we can take to end the racist drug war.Decriminalization means nobody gets arrested, goes to jail or prison, or faces criminal punishment for using or possessing a small amount of a drug for personal use.Oregon made history when it became the first U.S. state to decriminalize all drugs. Now it’s time to do it in even more states and federally.Join our fight to decriminalize drugs and dismantle the disastrous drug war.First name *Last name *E-mail address ** Drug Policy Alliance is committed to protecting your privacy and will never share your email address.If you sign and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.If you take action and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.If you donate and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.Drug Policy Alliance Headquarters131 West 33rd Street, 15th FloorNew York, New York 10001P. 212.613.8020Privacy Policy.Terms & Conditions.Copyright © 2021 Drug Policy Alliance.
