Children, teens, and adults of all genders are exploited for sex and labor in our city every day. We exist to change that.Preventing ExploitationTo fully end human trafficking, we must both support survivors and prevent people from ever being abused. By learning how to recognize the signs of trafficking, teens know how to stay safe and avoid exploitation. Informed kids are less likely to succumb to traffickers’ tactics.Educating the CommunityEducation prepares the community. Through educational trainings, we prepare professionals, first responders, and community members to recognize and address human trafficking situations. Institutions become qualified to aid victims and survivors with a trauma-informed approach. Through our podcast, community members learn how to break down the systems that enable trafficking to flourish.Empowering SurvivorsOutreach prevents exploitation and empowers victims and survivors. Through case management, support groups, and direct outreach, we bridge the gap between service providers and those who need them. We interact with overlooked people to identify exploitation and empower them with appropriate resources for restoration.Human trafficking is a violation of basic human rights and should be addressed as such. Together, we must restore that basic human right to every trafficked person—freedom.Our TeamTIMEKA WALKERChief Executive OfficerView BioELAINE ANDINOChief Programs & Strategy OfficerView BioTITUS BENTONChief Operating OfficerView BioKEN HENRYDirector of Collaboration & StrategyView BioAU’VONNIE ALEXANDERDirector of PreventionView BioNATE ARNESONNational Pathway ManagerView BioSARA JAYNE BREUERCollaboration ManagerView BioSAMMY LOESCHRegional Pathway ManagerView BioEMMA CHONGGrant WriterView BioDALTON TAYLOR JOHNSONPrevention & Outreach CoordinatorView BioANNA JOHNSTONCommunications CoordinatorView BioJENNY MACAHONHR Coordinator/Executive AssistantView BioMISA NGUYENCoalition CoordinatorView BioANDREW WRIGHTFinance CoordinatorView BioELYSE LEWANDOWSKIData CoordinatorView BioTimeka WalkerChief Executive OfficerMaster of Social Work, University of Houston | Bachelor of Science in Psychology, University of Houston| Non-Profit Leadership Alliance | Executive Leadership Certification at Rice University | FBI Citizens AcademyA licensed social worker, Timeka Walker is an innovative leader with over 18 years in nonprofit management and leadership.
