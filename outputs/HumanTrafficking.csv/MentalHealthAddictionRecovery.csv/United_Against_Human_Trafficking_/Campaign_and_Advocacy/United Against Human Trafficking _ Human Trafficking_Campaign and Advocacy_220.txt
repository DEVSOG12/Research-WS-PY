We envision a collective end to human trafficking in Greater Houston and Lake Charles.Why?After facing trauma and exploitation, survivors deserve the best care that can be offered. By uniting a diverse group of social service agencies, faith communities, business and other organizations, UAHT Coalitions are creating a systemic solution of care and community resources.Join The CoalitionLog Into The Pathway Referral Network57Participating Organizations in 2021.The PathwayConnecting trafficked persons to service providers through one central system, we are committed to paving a pathway to coordinated care where inter-agency collaboration is celebrated. The Pathway is an online, interactive database for survivors and Case Managers to access resources in one central location.Why?Many of our partners specialize on one issue – homelessness, substance use, therapy, legal aid. Each holds necessary and life-saving programs in our city. But trafficking survivors need care from all the specialists. Too many times, we’ve seen trafficking survivors slip through the cracks of systems meant to empower them. It’s time to go beyond providing individual services and unify our efforts to ensure no trafficking survivor gets left behind.57Participating Organizations in 2021.“…the benefits of trusted partners in this work cannot be overstated. Additionally, the objectives and goals of the Coalition are aimed at improving our ability to serve our community, so the effort of committee work results in the strengthening of my agencies’ efforts.”– A Coalition PartnerTogether, we strategize the fight against human trafficking.With each action we take, we seek input from our Survivor Expert Advisory Committee to ensure best practices.

Each January, UAHT, in partnership with the HRRC, hosts Human Trafficking Awareness Month (HTAM). The City of Houston officially proclaims the month of January as Human Trafficking Awareness Month, and then agencies all over Houston coordinate awareness events, volunteer opportunities, and advocacy days to sound the alarm across the greater Houston area. By showing a united and collaborative front, we inspire hope in the community that change is possible. Through a multitude of events, we increase engagement and involve everyone in the fight to end human trafficking.Coalition MembersJoin the CoalitionAre you passionate about ending human trafficking?
