It’s so tough, in fact, that most survivors return to the Life many times before breaking free for good.What makes the difference between getting stuck in a cycle of exploitation versus breaking free? A support system.“[My clients] know what they need, they know what they want, and they know how to do it. They just need encouragement to get there,” Erin reflected.That’s why having a trained Case Manager is a gamechanger for survivors on their journey to reclaim their lives.Erin calls her clients frequently to check in and make sure they have everything they need. If they don’t, she ensures they get it. She picks up groceries for them and helps complete police reports. She tells her clients she’s proud of their progress and reminds them to be proud of themselves, too.And YOU, our amazing supporters, make it possible for over 30 clients to have Erin as a partner and guide through their complex, daunting journeys.Because of you, Natalia is out of jail, healing, and forging a free future. THANK YOU!Learn More About UAHT's Survivor Services2021 HighlightsPrevention ProgramsEducationDirect ServicesOutreachCoalitionRecent PostsKPLC News: United Against Human Trafficking in Calcasieu Parish LaunchesAugust 30, 2022Group Organized to Fight Human Trafficking in CalcasieuAugust 29, 2022June NewsletterJune 9, 2022Everything You Need To Know About Labor TraffickingMay 9, 2022April NewsletterApril 19, 2022Follow UAHTContact Uscontact@uaht.org(713) 874-0290Physical Address6671 Southwest Freeway, Suite 220Houston, Texas 77074Mailing AddressP.O.
