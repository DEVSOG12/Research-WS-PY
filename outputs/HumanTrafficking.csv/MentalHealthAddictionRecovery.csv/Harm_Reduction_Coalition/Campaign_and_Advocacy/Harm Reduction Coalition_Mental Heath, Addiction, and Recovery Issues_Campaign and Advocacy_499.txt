They were involved in every step of the process – from telling us what they wanted to see and how they wanted to see it, what they wanted everyone to know, what they wanted to learn, and how they wanted to see themselves and their community. These are their faces, strategies, stories, and lives. Each person featured in this campaign has helped ensure the safety and survival of their fellow San Franciscans. This work often goes unnoticed by the community-at-large, and they do it without notice or compensation, every day. Thousands of people survive their overdoses every year in our city because of people who use drugs and harm reduction workers.”Kristen Marshall (she/her),DOPE Project ManagerCommunity Awareness CampaignThe DOPE Project created an educational ad campaign to raise awareness around overdose in San Francisco.The intention was to honor and bring to life the stories and experiences of our fellow San Franciscans.
