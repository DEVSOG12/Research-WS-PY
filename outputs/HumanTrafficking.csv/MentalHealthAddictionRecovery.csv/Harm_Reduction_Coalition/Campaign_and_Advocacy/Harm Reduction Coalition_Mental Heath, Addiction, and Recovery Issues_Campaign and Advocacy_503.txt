This comprehensive document is designed to help explain the laws impacting syringe services programs in your state. Like you, we understand that safe and straightforward access to sterile syringes is vital for many in our communities.Because legislation plays an active role in making sure that everyone has access to the fundamental services that we all need to thrive, we want to ensure that you have the resources that you need to effectively motivate change. This guide will help you to understand how your state’s government is ensuring that communities have access to safe syringes and to identify where there are gaps in legislative policy that have contributed to inequities in safe services.If you are thinking about proactively starting a campaign to provide safe access to syringes in your community, please contact the policy team at policy@harmreduction.org. We also understand that the policy landscape is only one part of building a supportive environment for robust and sustainable syringe access. If you are looking for resources for building and maintaining a program, you can find all of our syringe access resources here.Next: DefinitionsPrevious:Last modified: August 31, 2020Table of ContentsIntroductionDefinitionsSyringe Access in Your StateCitationsRelated ContentTraining GuideHarm Reduction is Healthcare: Sustainable Funding for Harm Reduction ProgramsTraining GuideSpirit of Harm Reduction: A Toolkit for Communities of Faith Facing OverdoseTraining GuidePregnancy and Substance Use: A Harm Reduction ToolkitNational Harm Reduction Coalition creates spaces for dialogue and action that help heal the harms caused by racialized drug policies.Mailing address:National Harm Reduction Coalition243 5th Ave#529New York, NY 10016HomeDonateStart A Harm Reduction ProgramThe Movement Evolution of The MovementPrinciples of Harm ReductionFaces of Harm ReductionWho We Are TeamCareersOpportunitiesImpactMediaContactWhat We Do Overdose PreventionSyringe Access ImplementationTraining & Capacity BuildingTraining CenterOnline Training InstituteResource Center Harm Reduction Resources Near YouHarm Reduction IssuesSyringe AccessOverdose PreventionFentanylMedication for Opioid Use DisorderHarm Reduction IntersectsBlogCopyright 2020 © National Harm Reduction Coalition.
