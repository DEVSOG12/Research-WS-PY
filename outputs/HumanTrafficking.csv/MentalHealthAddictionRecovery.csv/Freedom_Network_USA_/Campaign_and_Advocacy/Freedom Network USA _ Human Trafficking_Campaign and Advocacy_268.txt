FNUSA is presenting data and analysis on trafficking survivors’ fear of reporting their victimization to law enforcement. We are challenging changes to immigration policies and procedures that make the Continued Presence and the T and U Visas harder and more dangerous for trafficking survivors to access. Freedom Network USA is also pointing out all of the ways in which changes to immigration policies that are not specific to trafficking, are harming trafficking survivors.Promoting Real and Comprehensive Human Trafficking PreventionFNUSA advocates for a comprehensive approach to prevention of human trafficking, including immigration protections, expanded access to affordable housing and health care, protection from discrimination, and expanded labor protections.Policy LibrarySearch FNUSA’s extensive library of policy papers, advocacy letters, and recommendations.Read MoreSurvivor Reentry ProjectFind comprehensive resources on post-conviction relief for trafficking survivors, including state summaries, sample pleadings, and more.
