The FORTE Act would deter human trafficking by increasing information access to overseas workers regarding prospective jobs, visas and other conditions of work in the United States, as well as requiring registration of foreign labor recruitment agencies at the Department of Labor, while prohibiting recruitment fees paid by workers.Passage of the FORTE Act, and improve enforcement of human labor trafficking violations is of the utmost importance.  As the article states,‘We should demand no less from a Tier 1 country and a leader in the global battle to end modern slavery.’Shandra, a survivor of human trafficking and a speaker at this year’s annual Freedom Network Conference, is the founder of Mentari, a New York-based nonprofit organization dedicated to providing training and economic empowerment support to victims of human trafficking.
