Every year the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the US State Department releases the report, which is used as the primary tool to engage foreign governments on the issue of human trafficking. The report ranks countries on a three-tier scale based on their efforts to support survivors and eradicate human trafficking.For the first time, FNUSA calls for the US to be downgraded from Tier 1 status. Executive Director, Jean Bruggeman cites, “the US has not only failed to comprehensively address human trafficking, but is actively putting people at increased risk, and making it more difficult for survivors to find protection, services, and safety.” Last week, she and other advocates echoed calls for the downgrade.FNUSA calls on the US Government to live up to the promise of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and truly earn a Tier 1 ranking. We urge federal agencies to work with survivors and advocates to make services and protection a reality for all victims of abuse and exploitation.Contact UsFreedom Network USA712 H St NE, Suite 1667Washington, DC 20002202-768-7338PRESS KIT© 2022 Freedom Network USA
