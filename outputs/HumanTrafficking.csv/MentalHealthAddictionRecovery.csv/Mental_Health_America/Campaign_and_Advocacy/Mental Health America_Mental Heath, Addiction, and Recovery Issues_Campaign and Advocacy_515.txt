In the field of mental health, we are familiar with “person first” language. This is language that prioritizes the identity of individuals as human beings with unique experiences and identities over their mental health status. For example, we avoid describing people as “schizophrenics” and instead refer to them as “people with schizophrenia.”This concept can be carried out as well in the way we refer to BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color). The continued use of “minority or marginalized” sets up BIPOC communities in terms of their quantity instead of their quality and removes their personhood. The use of these terms directly contradicts MHA’s focus on the individual and our hope to empower the individual as a whole person. The word “minority” also emphasizes the power differential between “majority” and “minority” groups and can make BIPOC feel as though “minority” is synonymous with inferiority. Though “minority” and “marginalized” may continue to be used in academic spaces, the words the mental health community uses need to change in order to help communities understand how these terms create and perpetuate negative images and stereotypes of individuals that identify as BIPOC. By including “BI” Black and Indigenous in addition to “POC” people of color, we are honoring the unique experiences of Black and Indigenous individuals and their communities, as well as the spectrum of existence and experience by POC. Thus, as of July 2020, MHA will no longer use the term “minority” and is currently phasing out the term "minority" across our materials and website.  This change helps demonstrate that we are actively working on looking at our own work and the role we play in educating others.To promote and be effective in addressing mental health for all, MHA uses a racial equity and intersectional lens to highlight, better understand, and effectively respond to the range of experiences held by individuals and families with diverse values, beliefs, and sexual orientations, in addition to backgrounds that vary by race, ethnicity, religion, and language.That's why we've put together the information in this hub:BIPOC mental health statistics and general informationBIPOC Mental Health InfographicHealthcare disparities among Black, Indigenous, and People Of ColorPolicy issues relevant to special populationsJuly Is BIPOC Mental Health MonthFormally recognized in June 2008, Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month was created to bring awareness to the unique struggles that underrepresented groups face in regard to mental illness in the United States.Bebe Moore Campbell was an American author, journalist, teacher, and mental health advocate who worked tirelessly to shed light on the mental health needs of the Black community and other underrepresented communities.In an effort to continue the visionary work of Bebe Moore Campbell, each year we develop a public education campaign dedicated to addressing the needs of BIPOC.Click here to view this year's campaignBIPOC mental health statistics and general informationPlease note that the statistics below are a brief overview of the prevalence of mental health conditions in special populations.
