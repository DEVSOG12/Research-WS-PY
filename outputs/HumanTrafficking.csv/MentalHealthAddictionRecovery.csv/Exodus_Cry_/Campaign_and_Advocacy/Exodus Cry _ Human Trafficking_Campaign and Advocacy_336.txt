We are asking political powers to enact and enforce laws that will eradicate exploitation in the sex industry and eliminate sex trafficking. This is absolutely necessary to restore and preserve freedom and justice in society.Our reform efforts include:Shifting mindsets by educating legislatorsWe host screenings of Nefarious: Merchant of Souls, conduct briefings, and present information to legislators in order to educate them about the issue of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, offering ways to eradicate it. We want legislators to understand that prostitution is not a job but rather a form of violence against women and children. We back this claim with credible research and fact-based evidence.Advocating for the adoption of new lawsWe seek to prevent the perpetuation of sex trafficking and abolish commercial sexual exploitation globally by advocating for specific laws and policies that reduce the demand for commercial sex. Our team examines existing laws and looks for ways to improve them. They also help to draft new legislation aimed at the abolition of commercial sexual exploitationCreating ResourcesWe provide legislators with expert testimony and the resources and research to help them present a convincing case before their fellow legislators. We also offer screenings of our award-winning documentaries at governmental hearings.Our impactPast legal reform$25A MONTH CANProvide an exploited woman with a Hope Bag full of hygiene and beauty products and an exit resource packetProvide gifts to exploited women in strip clubs$50A MONTH CANMobilize support for legislation that will target demand and help eradicate sex traffickingEducate tens of thousands about commercial exploitation through a week’s worth of engaging contentSend an Intervention Team on one local outreach$100A MONTH CANResource the campaign to fight “Big Porn”Fuel the creation of paradigm shifting documentaries designed to expose systems of trafficking and exploitationHelp fund a major outreach operation at a national or international sporting eventWe’ve started the fight.
