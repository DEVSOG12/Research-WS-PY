The third spa doesn’t have a website.One review made it clear to prospective sex buyers that the Gold Spa is a front by saying, “if you were wondering yes it is,” and another suggested, “ask for a Korean girl from the lady that meets you at the door.”With Atlanta being one of the top 5 cities in the United States for reports of human trafficking, it is extremely likely that these murder victims were victims of sex trafficking.The shooter admitted to sex addiction and likely frequented these brothels.The shooter saw his victims as expendable to meet his own needs. In his own words, he killed them because they were, “a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.”This horrible incident highlights just how critical it is to address human trafficking at its roots: racism, misogyny, poverty, and demand.There are over 313,000 victims of human trafficking in Texas – and over 1,280,000 in the Americas. Each of those victims – who are already experiencing an extreme form of abuse – are at a heightened risk for additional forms of violence just as we are seeing now. One study found that 71% of prostituted people were physically assaulted.Simply put, if we live in a society where we’re okay purchasing another human being for even a half hour, we don’t value others lives as our own.Our thoughts are with those who died in Atlanta. May we all learn from this horrific crime and may we keep fighting until every person lives free.2021 HighlightsPrevention ProgramsEducationDirect ServicesOutreachCoalitionRecent PostsKPLC News: United Against Human Trafficking in Calcasieu Parish LaunchesAugust 30, 2022Group Organized to Fight Human Trafficking in CalcasieuAugust 29, 2022June NewsletterJune 9, 2022Everything You Need To Know About Labor TraffickingMay 9, 2022April NewsletterApril 19, 2022Follow UAHTContact Uscontact@uaht.org(713) 874-0290Physical Address6671 Southwest Freeway, Suite 220Houston, Texas 77074Mailing AddressP.O.
