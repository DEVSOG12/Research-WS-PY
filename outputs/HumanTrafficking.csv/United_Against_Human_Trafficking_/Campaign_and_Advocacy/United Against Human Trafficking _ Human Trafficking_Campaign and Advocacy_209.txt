Then everything changed.After a couple weeks, the boyfriend demanded Robin “pay off the debt she owed him” by having sex with his friends.At first, Robin refused, but was frightened when her boyfriend asserted he was secretly a police officer and could throw her in prison if she didn’t comply.As a trans woman, Robin was terrified of being thrown into prison – so she did what he said.Finally, Robin couldn’t take it anymore; she knew she needed to get away.To escape her trafficker, Robin needed to secure a safe place to live.So she called us. But we can’t always find a shelter.Houston lacks short-term housing for trafficking survivors while they wait for long-term placement.There are only 529 beds exclusively for trafficking survivors in the entire United States, but an estimated 313,000 trafficking victims in Texas alone.Even survivors who are connected to support groups and legal services may not have a safe place to sleep. Left with no other option, they resort to laying on the concrete, resting on a park bench, camping under a bridge, or sleeping in a temporary shelter.You may be thinking, “what about shelters that aren’t only for trafficking survivors?”While some trafficking survivors find a place to sleep overnight at homeless shelters, most shelters lack the resources trafficking survivors need to stay safe.Many shelters only offer a place to stay over-night, leaving survivors with nowhere to go during the day. Reports to the National Human Trafficking Hotline show that traffickers even recruit victims in homeless shelters.Thankfully, our team connected Robin to a shelter where she could escape her trafficker!But as we move forward in our fight against human trafficking, it’s critical that we fill this gap in services.We must face this reality: we need more inclusive beds and safe homes established specifically for trafficking survivors.How We Empower Survivors With Case Management2021 HighlightsPrevention ProgramsEducationDirect ServicesOutreachCoalitionRecent PostsKPLC News: United Against Human Trafficking in Calcasieu Parish LaunchesAugust 30, 2022Group Organized to Fight Human Trafficking in CalcasieuAugust 29, 2022June NewsletterJune 9, 2022Everything You Need To Know About Labor TraffickingMay 9, 2022April NewsletterApril 19, 2022Follow UAHTContact Uscontact@uaht.org(713) 874-0290Physical Address6671 Southwest Freeway, Suite 220Houston, Texas 77074Mailing AddressP.O.
