The Pathway is an online, interactive database for survivors and Case Managers to access resources in one central location.Why?Many of our partners specialize on one issue – homelessness, substance use, therapy, legal aid. Each holds necessary and life-saving programs in our city. But trafficking survivors need care from all the specialists. Too many times, we’ve seen trafficking survivors slip through the cracks of systems meant to empower them. It’s time to go beyond providing individual services and unify our efforts to ensure no trafficking survivor gets left behind.57Participating members in 2021.Learn MoreGive TodaySupport from people like you helps bring freedom to those trapped in modern-day slavery.
