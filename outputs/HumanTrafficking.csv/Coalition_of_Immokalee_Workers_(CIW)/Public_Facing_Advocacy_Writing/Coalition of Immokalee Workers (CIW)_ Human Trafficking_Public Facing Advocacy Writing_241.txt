Their efforts have helped spur the use of “Fair Food” labels for produce that is grown and packed ethically.“In the past three years, [the tomato fields in Immokalee] have gone from being the worst to the best” in the country, according to Susan Marquis, dean of the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, Calif.Last fall, Giant and Stop & Shop, two grocery chains in New England, began carrying the label….… Such sourcing clues tap directly into the portion of the US consumer base that has begun to turn once routine shopping decisions into moral guideposts. Labor experts see a lot of promise in using labels as a tool to spread the reforms seen in Immokalee to other agricultural centers around the US.Read the series: Trafficking: In Florida’s tomato fields, a fight for ethical farm labor growsYou can find the full list of six solutions here.  In the meantime, as we continue to ramp up to the big Workers’ Voice Tour this coming March, remember that the Fair Food Program’s unique and proven success is exactly why we are demanding — not asking — that Wendy’s join the Fair Food Program without further delay, because the Fair Food Program is the best and only real solution to farmworker exploitation in Wendy’s supply chain.Justice delayed is justice denied, and the workers who have picked Wendy’s tomatoes for generations in unspeakable poverty and degradation should not have to wait one minute longer for the justice they have earned many, many times over.Post navigationTOMORROW:Give Wendy’s Board Chairman Nelson Peltz a buzz!New York Times talks sexual harassment in the fields, letter cites Fair Food Program’s unique success in preventing abuse!HIGHLIGHTSNew 10-year study confirms: All social responsibility programs NOT created equal!New 10-year study confirms: All social responsibility programs NOT created equal!New 10-year study confirms: All social responsibility programs NOT created equal!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!Time’s Up leader Alyssa Milano narrates powerful new Fair Food Program video!CNN Freedom Project on the Fair Food Program: “... the most comprehensive social responsibility program in U.S. agriculture...”UN expert: FFP “must be considered an international benchmark” in fight against modern-day slavery!UN expert: FFP “must be considered an international benchmark” in fight against modern-day slavery!UN expert: FFP “must be considered an international benchmark” in fight against modern-day slavery!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!JOIN OUR TEAMWE'RE HIRING NEW STAFF!Email updates2019 TEDMED TALKhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rtUy1apCWURECOGNITION 2017 MacArthur Fellowship2015 Presidential Medal2014 Clinton Global Citizen Award2013 Franklin D.
