Here below is an excerpt from one of the editorials, and links to three of the best:“Human Trafficking and the Food We Buy,” (Sojourners, 1/11/11)“Time to stop human trafficking,” (Gainesville Sun, 1/10/11)“Publix not on board with protecting farmworkers,” (Palm Beach Post, 1/9/11)“Tuesday marks Human Trafficking Awareness Day, a yearly acknowledgment of the odious prevalence of forced labor. Since 1997, nine cases of modern-day slavery involving more than 1,100 Florida farmworkers have been brought successfully to court.In South Florida, deemed “ground zero for modern slavery” by a chief assistant U.S. attorney who has prosecuted multiple servitude operations, we need look no further than our local supermarket to find indifference to the plight of Floridians held against their will. Publix, a major buyer of Sunshine State produce, recently made known its lack of concern for abuse in its supply chain. When asked by The Bulletin in Alabama last month about exploitation on the farms where it buys its produce, Publix spokesman Dwaine Stevens responded: “If there are some atrocities going on, it’s not our business. Maybe it’s something the government should get involved with.”…… By contrast, local Publix competitor Whole Foods signed an agreement with the CIW in 2008, committing its considerable purchasing power toward more humane labor standards in Florida’s tomato industry. Food retailers that take a stand for the rights of the women and men who harvest our nation’s food – as opposed to shamelessly shrugging off their enslavement as “not our business” – truly make shopping a pleasure.” read moreAll the more reason to join us for the February 27 to March 5 Ahold/Publix mobilizations and tour!Post navigationProtests, press continue as momentum builds in Campaign for Fair Food in lead up to February supermarket action!Happy MLK Day!HIGHLIGHTSNew 10-year study confirms: All social responsibility programs NOT created equal!New 10-year study confirms: All social responsibility programs NOT created equal!New 10-year study confirms: All social responsibility programs NOT created equal!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!Time’s Up leader Alyssa Milano narrates powerful new Fair Food Program video!CNN Freedom Project on the Fair Food Program: “... the most comprehensive social responsibility program in U.S. agriculture...”UN expert: FFP “must be considered an international benchmark” in fight against modern-day slavery!UN expert: FFP “must be considered an international benchmark” in fight against modern-day slavery!UN expert: FFP “must be considered an international benchmark” in fight against modern-day slavery!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!CIW receives Presidential Medal for Extraordinary Efforts in Combatting Modern-Day Slavery at White House Forum!JOIN OUR TEAMWE'RE HIRING NEW STAFF!Email updates2019 TEDMED TALKhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rtUy1apCWURECOGNITION 2017 MacArthur Fellowship2015 Presidential Medal2014 Clinton Global Citizen Award2013 Franklin D.
