Through these programs, CAST has helped empower survivors to overcome their traumatic pasts and become leading voices in shaping policy and public awareness to ultimately put an end to the fastest growing criminal enterprise of the 21st century.see our 2021 Impact reportsee impact archiveBy connecting survivors across the country, through CAST’s Advisory Caucus and National Survivor Network, the organization supports and encourages survivors to realize their own leadership qualities and to value their insight not just as survivors, but as experts in the human trafficking field. The depth of CAST’s work has not only changed the lives of those impacted by human trafficking, but it has positioned CAST as an organization leading the charge to help finally put an end to this epidemic.CAST is one of the pioneers of the US anti-trafficking movement. The organization was founded by Dr. Kathryn McMahon, the Thai CDC and a group of community activists, in response to the discovery of 72 Thai workers that had been kept for seven years in slavery and debt bondage in Los Angeles County. Led by celebrated human rights activist Kay Buck, CAST’s immeasurable contribution to survivors of human trafficking has been recognized by President Obama, who honored CAST with the Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons in 2014.Click to View CAST'sPlatinum Guidestar ProfileClick to View CAST's4-star Charity Navigator ProfileSIGN UP FOR NEWS AND UPDATES:Count me inFOLLOW USTweets by CASTLATHE ISSUEAbout Human TraffickingGet InvolvedEducateReport Human TraffickingSupportConnectVolunteerCareersInternshipsSupport PolicyPolicy AgendasPolicy SuccessesTRAINING & RESOURCESTrainingHuman Trafficking 101 TrainingPro Bono TrainingLegal Anti-Trafficking Weekly Working GroupSocial Services Monthly Technical Assistance Call16-Hour Legal Training8-Hour Legal Services Training for Social Service ProvidersResourcesCAST Publications & ReportsAdditional ResourcesResources for Legal Service ProvidersABOUT CASTServices & ProgramsHOTLINE & EMERGENCY RESPONSESOCIAL SERVICESLEGAL SERVICESSHELTERYouth ProgramSURVIVOR LEADERSHIPPARTNERSHIPS & OUTREACHTraining & Technical AssistanceADVOCACY & Public PolicyLeadership TeamFinancialsIn the NewsContactCONNECTFollow us on InstagramFollow us on TwitterConnect with us on FacebookConnect with us on LinkedInWatch our Videos on YouTube© 2022 Cast LA|Site by BistroThanks to QuestionPro's generosity, we now have survey software that powers our data intelligence
