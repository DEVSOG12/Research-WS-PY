A society that facilitates it.We live in a pornified society that promotes sexual objectification and tolerates sexual exploitation. The “sex sells” mindset has saturated the world around us, even shaping the lives of our children. But what happens to a society that commercializes sex?Sexuality becomes separated from a real person and becomes a commodity. It becomes no more valuable than the product it’s pushing. Though sex trafficking is a deeply disturbing injustice, its existence is not all that shocking in light of the way much of our world views sexuality.If we want to live in a world where people aren’t sold for sex, then our hyper-sexualized society must be transformed—that’s how we can stop exploitation before it starts.“In this age, in this country, public sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces judicial decisions.” —Abraham LincolnBecome an InfluencerYou can help break the cycle of commercial sexual exploitation.

He knew that to enact change he would need to change the culture, so he—alongside many like-minded abolitionists—launched a strategic grassroots campaign to educate the masses and change public opinion. Though it took decades, Wilberforce helped bring about a historic shift in the minds of the people, resulting in the abolition of slavery in the entire British Empire.Our impactfighting for a shift in cultureNefarious: Merchant of Souls$25A MONTH CANProvide an exploited woman with a Hope Bag full of hygiene and beauty products and an exit resource packetProvide gifts to exploited women in strip clubs$50A MONTH CANMobilize support for legislation that will target demand and help eradicate sex traffickingEducate tens of thousands about commercial exploitation through a week’s worth of engaging contentSend an Intervention Team on one local outreach$100A MONTH CANResource the campaign to fight “Big Porn”Fuel the creation of paradigm shifting documentaries designed to expose systems of trafficking and exploitationHelp fund a major outreach operation at a national or international sporting eventWe’ve started the fight.
