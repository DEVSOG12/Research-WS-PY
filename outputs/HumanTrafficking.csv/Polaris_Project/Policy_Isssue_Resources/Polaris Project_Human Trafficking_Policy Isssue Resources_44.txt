Polaris is active in coalitions supporting both structural overhauls of major systems, such as temporary work visas, and on individual, trafficking-specific bills.Overhaul Temporary Work VisasA bipartisan group of lawmakers once again introduced the Visa Transparency Anti-Trafficking Act. This common-sense legislation is aimed at the system of temporary work visas, which is poorly designed and rife with trafficking and exploitation. This bill would give researchers, workers and NGOs more of the information necessary to keep traffickers from gaming the system.Take ActionNew Bill Would Bring Transparency to America’s Work Visa System and Fight Human TraffickingHuman Trafficking on Temporary Work Visas: A Data Analysis 2015-2017H.R.3881 – Visa Transparency Anti-Trafficking Act of 2019Domestic Workers Bill of RightsDomestic workers comprise the highest number of victims of labor trafficking reported to the U.S.National Human Trafficking Hotline. This important legislation would go a long way toward providing these vital members of our economy the same protections as other members of the U.S. workforce. That alone would go a long way toward reducing trafficking of nannies, housekeepers, and others who work in our homes.Take ActionWe partnered with the National Domestic Workers Alliance.Read our report Human Trafficking at Home: Labor Trafficking of Domestic Workers.Summary of the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights.Support for SurvivorsAccording to the best available research, virtually all survivors have some kind of criminal record as a direct result of their being sex or labor trafficked. Many states have begun to recognize the hypocrisy inherent in these records as well as the problems having a record poses for survivors seeking to heal and start over. But for inexplicable reasons, the U.S. Department of Justice has cut off a program that helped human trafficking survivors get legal representation and clear their criminal records. That’s bad policy and a bad message to send to survivors.Learn MoreDOJ Pressed To Explain Legal Aid Cut For Trafficking VictimsFunding Restrictions for Human Trafficking Grants Can Prevent Victims from Getting JusticeFreedom Network USA Leads Broad-based Effort to Protect Legal Representation for Trafficking SurvivorsSign up to learn more about how you can helpOne moment please...Thank you for subscribing!EmailFollow usContactMediaBlogAboutPrivacy Policy2022 | Polaris is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization- please donate now.* Message and data rates may apply.
