Its goal was to enable actors in the anti-human trafficking field to better locate, identify, and connect with each other, as well as help connect victims of human trafficking and at-risk populations to the help they need.Over the last seven years, the GMSD has undergone many changes. Over 2,100 organizations have been added, it’s been translated into Spanish and French, and a yearly vetting process has been instituted. Additionally, a partnership with the Freedom Collaborative and Eurasia Foundation was formed to share and include more information about international service providers. These improvements have enabled over 142,000 visitors to the site to connect to much needed resources and services. The GMSD also became the primary resource for international cases on the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, which has been used in over 5,700 potential international trafficking cases since 2014.As the GMSD has grown over the years, it became evident that it needed to be more than just a digital-age phone book. Thanks to a generous grant by the Carlson Foundation and members input about what they wanted to see in future iterations, Polaris has been able to give the GMSD a much needed update. The updated website has a more interactive, user-friendly interface, provides more information about the organizations listed, includes a mobile/tablet version, and provides a clearer visualization of the global anti-trafficking field.What’s changed?Safety was at the forefront of our planning process. With feedback from GMSD users and survivors, we learned that ensuring a safe browsing experience was critical for the new site. To this end we have instituted two safe browsing tools: the safe browsing toggle, which can be turned on and off, and an effective quick exit button, both of which follow the user as they navigate throughout the site.We’ve made it easier to locate services quickly by adding a suggested provider on the home page based on the person’s location if the location services are turned on for their device.With its more user-friendly and interactive map, you can now visualize the anti-trafficking field through color variants on the map – the darker the shade, the more resources available in that country. The search filters have been updated to include more options and you can download a CSV of all the service providers listed based on filtered search results.Once search filters have been selected, you’ll see “first glance” information about the service providers underneath the map. By clicking the “see more” button, users will be brought to the main page of the organization, which provides more information, including publicly available phone numbers, hours/days of operation, hotline services, the organization’s mission statement, countries of operation, and services provided filtered by populations served.
