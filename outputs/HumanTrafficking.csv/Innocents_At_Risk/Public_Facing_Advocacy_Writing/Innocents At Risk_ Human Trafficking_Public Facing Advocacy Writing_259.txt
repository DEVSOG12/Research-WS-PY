This year has made us realize that talking about the issue of child trafficking is more important than ever as the pandemic has only enabled traffickers to increase their activity online, and everywhere else. Children have become victims of a $150 billion dollar industry. We hope you will join Innocents at Risk and help keep children safe!Through our partnership with New York-based Parichute, Innocents at Risk learned of a new facial recognition system that can be used to find missing children. We introduced this concept to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMECI). It’s so important to use every available tool possible to help find missing children, and the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children does just that. Innocents at Risk is proud to be a partner of NCMEC!To increase awareness, Innocents at Risk spoke on virtual panels for The Lincoln Park Methodist Church, American Mother’s Inc., The United Nations Mission on the Status of Women, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, The Daughters of the American Revolution, and the International Forum of Voices Against Trafficking. Sarah Flint hosted a shopping event in November in her beautiful Georgetown shop for Innocents at Risk. We are so grateful to Sarah and her staff for our special shopping event and for donating to Innocents at Risk a portion of the sales. In addition to these partners, Innocents at Risk has been selected again this year as a Mission Partner of Christ Church, Georgetown, for which we are very grateful. We will plan an event with the Christ Church community in 2022.View fullsizeYasmine Askalani, Mrs. Hala Youssef, Ambassador Motaz Zahran, Deborah Sigmund, Marie RoyceOn November 4, the ambassador of Egypt, Motaz Zahran, and his lovely wife, Hala Youssef, hosted a reception and buffet dinner for Innocents at Risk. Our special guest speaker for the event was Matt Osborne, director of international operations of Operation Underground Railroad. O.U.R has been a partner of Innocents at Risk since 2015. In 2017, Innocents at Risk honored O. U. R. Founder Tim Ballard, International Director Matt Osborne, and the entire O.U.R. team for all of their heroic work rescuing missing and taken women and children. Soon there will be a feature film, “The Sound of Freedom,” in theaters; it is the story of O.U.R. starring Jim Caviezel as Tim Ballard. On November 4th, the guests viewed the film trailer. Innocents at Risk is planning to host a film screening of “The Sound of Freedom” in 2022.Also in 2021, I authored a chapter about Innocents at Risk in the newly released Voicing Against Trafficking Book, Voices Against Trafficking: The Strength of Many Voices Speaking As One, available now on Amazon. The book has been accepted by the Library of Congress and provides essential truths and advice from trafficking survivors, human rights advocates, and journalists that affirm we can defeat the rising tide of human predators.Innocents at Risk is so proud to be a founding partner of Voices Against Trafficking, and we can all celebrate this New Year's Eve and New Year’s Day as Voices Against Trafficking will be featured for 24 hours on the 1540 Broadway Billboard in the heart of Times Square, starting at 3:00 p.m. New Year’s Eve.Finally, Innocents at Risk has launched a Podcast, Turning a Million Eyes to Save Lives, using Flight Attendant Initiative/DHS Blue Campaign training to educate the public about the ever-present and growing epidemic of human trafficking and ways to identify it in everyday life—giving people the tools they need to open their eyes and save lives!We appreciate your support in 2021 and throughout the past years. We hope you will consider making an end of year donation to enable our work to continue in 2022!Warmest Regards,Deborah SigmundFounder/DirectorInnocents at RiskNewer PostInnocents at Risk and Deborah Sigmund featured in Transport Security International articleOlder PostVoices Against Trafficking: The Strength of Many Voices Speaking As One is now out on Amazon!Child trafficking is happening in every corner of the world, in major cities and small towns, and in every state and province. Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
