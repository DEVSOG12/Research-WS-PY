She had gone to the restroom and when she didn’t return her father contacted the authorities. Security footage showed her leaving the arena with an unidentified man. She was found in a hotel room 10 days after she was reported missing. Her parents had reported her missing to the Dallas police. After days of no action or information coming from them, her parents decided to contact a Houston-based human trafficking prevention organization, Texas Counter-Trafficking Initiative, which was able to use facial recognition software to find images of the 15-year-old girl.After her daughter was found, the 15-year-old told her mother that she had met so many other girls who had been taken in similar situations and were being trafficked in Oklahoma. This 15-year-old girl was saved but we need to help prevent this from happening. Talk to your daughters and sons and warn them that human trafficking is everywhere. It can happen to any young boy or girl anywhere. It is so important that we continue to raise awareness in order to prevent this from happening.Read the full story and watch the TV news report here.Warmest Regards,Deborah SigmundFounder/DirectorInnocents at RiskMadelyn WardInnocents at Risk InternStetson UniversityNewer Post17-Year-Old Girl Escapes Trafficker at Shopping CenterOlder PostCongratulations to Operation Underground Railroad and Free A Girl for a Brilliant Take-DownChild trafficking is happening in every corner of the world, in major cities and small towns, and in every state and province. Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
