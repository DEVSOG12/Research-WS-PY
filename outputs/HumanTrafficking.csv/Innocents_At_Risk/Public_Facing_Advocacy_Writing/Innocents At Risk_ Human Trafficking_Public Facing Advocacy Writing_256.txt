Maxwell was involved with Jeffrey Epstein as she helped traffic girls that were sexually exploited by Epstein. In December of 2021, Maxwell was found guilty on five federal charges, including sex trafficking of a minor, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and three related counts of conspiracy. Yesterday, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in the sexual abuse of young girls by Jeffrey Epstein. Along with her prison sentence, Maxwell also received a fine of $750,000.Survivors of Maxwell’s atrocities spoke at the trial to provide their testimony of the tragedies they faced and how it impacted them. One survivor, Annie Farmer, noted that Maxwell seemed to take no responsibility for her actions, making it difficult to move on. On behalf of all of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, Innocents at Risk is grateful that Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison. While the prison sentencing cannot undo what Maxwell has done, it at least provides some justice for the victims and everyone harmed by Maxwell’s involvement with sex trafficking.You can read more about Maxwell’s sentencing and the testimony from the victims in this article. You can also hear from survivor Annie Farmer in the article.
