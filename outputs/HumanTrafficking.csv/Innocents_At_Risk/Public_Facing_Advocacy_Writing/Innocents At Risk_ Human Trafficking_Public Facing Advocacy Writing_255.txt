NCOSE is a nonprofit organization that uses a multidisciplinary team to fight sexual abuse and exploitation. The weekly meeting, hosted by NCOSE, gives these organizations and survivors a platform to share the work that they have been doing and how others can help.This past Friday, NCOSE hosted guest speaker Daniel Eastman from The Avery Center to talk about what they have been working on. The Avery Center is unique in that it is founded and staffed by survivors of sexual abuse. The Avery Center is a research institute and Mr. Eastman talked about research they have been doing on OnlyFans, the online platform marketed as a way for people to create sexual content for private users; unfortunately, it’s often used for trafficking and sexual exploitation.An article shared by The Avery Center discusses a couple who were trafficking women for sex and forcing them to post sexual content on OnlyFans. The sex trafficking ring spanned over six different states and involved multiple female victims. The couple would force the women to post on OnlyFans and engage in commercial sex by using physical violence, withholding their personal identification, and forcing them to use drugs. Fortunately, the couple has been arrested for their crimes and they can no longer traffic women for their personal profit.Innocents at Risk is very grateful to The Avery Center for the tremendous work they are doing and for bringing our attention to the problems with OnlyFans. OnlyFans is a dangerous site that promotes the trafficking of women and children. OnlyFans and sites like this should be taken down, which is one more way to protect women and children from sex trafficking.You can read more about the story mentioned above in this article.Warmest Regards,Deborah SigmundFounder/DirectorInnocents at RiskMadelyn WardInnocents at Risk InternStetson UniversityNewer PostSave the Date July 25th: Summit of the Fight Vs.
