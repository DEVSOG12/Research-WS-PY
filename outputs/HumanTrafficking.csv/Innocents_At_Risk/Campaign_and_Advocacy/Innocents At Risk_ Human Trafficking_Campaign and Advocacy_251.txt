Laws should not penalize children who have been trafficked. Every state should raise the age of consent to engage in all commercial sex activities to 21 years. State and local governments need to have human trafficking legislation that is in accordance with the federal TVPA and assess current laws that may conflict with federal laws concerning anti-trafficking. Crime and corruption can all undermine law enforcement. Attitudes and practices need to change: Beliefs about the role of girls, particularly with regard to their education, can lead to families putting girls at risk. Sometimes it is considered better for a girl to seek domestic work, perhaps in another country, than go to school.Children need to be aware of dangers of trafficking so that they can protect themselves: Children are often lured with promises of money and a “better life.” Children need to be offered practical skills that allow them to find viable alternatives to being trafficked. This could include vocational training or income-generating activities at the community leave.Adults need to be able to recognize the signs and respond accordingly: A teacher needs to recognize in a child the warning signs of a troubled home. Likewise, police raiding a brothel need to know to search for girls who have come from other countries, since they are often trafficking victims. A border guard with limited awareness of trafficking may not react when seeing young children crossing a border without their parents.Media Attention can be an important element in the fight against trafficking: Many families and children will be dependent on the media to inform and educate them about the danger of trafficking. Media reporting of trafficking issues can also encourage, influence or pressure others, including government and civil society, to respond to the problem of trafficking.Reintegration and rehabilitation for survivors of trafficking: States, local governments and communities should make sure that they have the resources to rescue and restore victims of human trafficking. Once they have been rescued, victims need care, security and justice. Children who have been trafficked need services to help them escape their situation and to return home to a “normal” life. These services might include hotlines that children can call to ask for help of safe shelters for them to stay in while they work out what they want to do. Children, their families, and their communities may need assistance when a trafficked child comes home. Survivors of trafficking need special assistance.Child trafficking is happening in every corner of the world, in major cities and small towns, and in every state and province. Children who have seen so little of life are taken by force or fraud and put into the worst of life: the child sex trade. Every 60 seconds, a child is trafficked into this dark and evil world. We all need to do everything we can to protect all children, to know what to look for and know how to report it. Now more than ever, we need your help to Turn A Million Eyes On Children.Download the PDFSubscribeSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.Email AddressSign UpThank you!Back to TopAdvisory BoardPartnersSponsorsFinancial RecordsGet In Touch1101 30th Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20007Phone: 202.625.4338 Fax: 202.625.4363 e-mail: debsigmund@gmail.com© 2006-2022 Innocents at Risk.
