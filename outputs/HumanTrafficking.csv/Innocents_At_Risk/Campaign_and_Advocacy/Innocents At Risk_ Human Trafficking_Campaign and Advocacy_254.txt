Currently, the reauthorization of this act is before Congress and will secure $1 billion of lifesaving funding.Introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) with bipartisan support, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Act of 2022 will reauthorize the TVPA through 2026.The reauthorization of the TVPA will continue to provide funding for:education grants for trainings about protecting children from trafficking and sexual exploitation, specifically online trafficking and sexual exploitationeducation and employment services for victims of human trafficking to support their re-integration into society and prevent their re-exploitationthe National Human Trafficking Hotline and affiliated investigative effortsThe reauthorization of the TVPA through the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Act is crucial for continuing the government's efforts to prevent human trafficking, protect trafficking victims, and prosecute perpetrators of these heinous crimes.Congressman Smith, the original sponsor of the TVPA of 2000, is joined by five members of the House of Representatives to support the passage of the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Act:Rep.
