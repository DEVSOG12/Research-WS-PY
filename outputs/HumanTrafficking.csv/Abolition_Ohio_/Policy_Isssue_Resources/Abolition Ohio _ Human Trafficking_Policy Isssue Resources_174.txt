It’s estimated that there are 10,000 IMBs in the US and 300 in Ohio. In this report, we provide an overview of IMBs with a focus on Ohio. Ohio is unique in the US in that massage therapy is licensed and regulated by the state medical board, but non-medical, non-therapeutic, or “relaxation” massage operates with nearly zero oversight or regulation. This loophole in the law has contributed to the spread of IMBs that exploit primarily foreign workers for commercial sex and forced labor. We present the scope and scale of the issue, discuss intersectional causes and impacts, and provide a detailed examination of both state and municipal policies. The report concludes with a disruption strategy designed to prevent exploitation and trafficking and reduce the number of IMBs in Ohio.Indicated on this map are massage establishments that have been listed on erotic massage review websites Rubmaps.ch and Adultsearch.com.
