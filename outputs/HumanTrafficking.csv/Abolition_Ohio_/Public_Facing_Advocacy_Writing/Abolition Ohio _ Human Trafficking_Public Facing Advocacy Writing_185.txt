The key to disrupting them lies in the fact that they are businesses. Traffickers and exploiters run IMBs because they are profitable. To disrupt them, reduce their profitability. Businesses identify a demand and then provide a good or service (supply) to meet that demand. In the most simple terms, to disrupt IMB networks, governments, advocates and service organizations must: a) reduce demand, b) increase the cost of doing business, and/or c) reduce the supply. Successfully taking action in all three areas is ideal for an effective disruption strategy.Reducing DemandBuyers must be convinced to not purchase commercial sex services at IMBs. There are two main pressure points to do this: increasing the criminal consequences and increasing the social consequences. Improving legal penalties and law enforcement will increase the chance that a buyer is caught and will face criminal charges or fines. Shifting cultural norms that accept or at least tolerate the objectification and exploitation of our fellow human beings will increase the social sanctions of such behavior. Together, increasing legal and social “risks” without a corresponding increase in “rewards” should deter sex buying at IMBs. A good start to accomplishing these would be a program of demand reduction-oriented public education and awareness-raising about the harms of IMBs and a campaign advocating for increased penalties and enforcement with local officials.Increasing the Cost of Doing BusinessHuman trafficking is a criminal enterprise with an extremely high-reward to risk ratio. To disrupt such an enterprise requires that this equation be changed. Risk can be increased in several ways. Increasing legal penalties for operating IMBs, improving training for law enforcement, and increased inspections for compliance with licensing and zoning requirements are good initial steps. Advocating for tougher state laws and stricter local ordinances puts pressure on IMB owners and managers. Providing culturally-sensitive human trafficking response and investigation training to law enforcement officers will improve interactions with victim-workers, leading to better implementation of laws, increased arrests, and, hopefully, more convictions. Victim-workers often are not English-speakers and are manipulated by fear and cultural norms to actively deny their victimization and not cooperate with law enforcement. Providing linguistically and otherwise, appropriate victim services will help to reduce re-exploitation of victim-workers and improve the odds of successful investigations, both of which increase risks for owners and managers.Finally, public education and awareness about human trafficking, including IMB-specific content, will help to create pressure for the adoption of more effective policies and the allocation of more resources for anti-IMB operations. An informed public will be able to identify signs of human trafficking at IMBs and make reports to police crime tip lines and anti-human trafficking hotlines, putting more pressure on IMB owners.Reducing VulnerabilitiesProviding culturally-sensitive, linguistically-appropriate and trauma-informed services to IMB victim-workers is critically important for the protection of their human rights. It also is critical to reach potential victims and vulnerable at-risk populations prior to their exploitation. Since most victims are recruited prior to their arrival in Ohio, advocates and officials should pursue collaboration with service providers and advocates in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other areas on anti-IMB recruitment programs and awareness-raising in high-risk populations. Different channels need to be used to reach the target populations. Appropriate awareness-raising messaging on social media and websites used by the groups (such as WeChat), cooperating with outreach services, or working directly with Chinese employment agencies on anti-IMB recruitment campaigns could reach groups at risk. Sharing information on programs and services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate could help to reduce vulnerabilities.Bringing It All TogetherOur response to IMBs is an anti-human trafficking initiative that has two overarching objectives: 1) to prevent sex and labor exploitation and human trafficking and 2) to reduce the number of IMBs in the Miami Valley and beyond. Accomplishing these objectives requires a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach aimed at reducing demand for services at IMBs, disrupting and increasing the cost of doing business for IMBs, and reducing the vulnerabilities of people at risk of exploitation in IMBs.We are at a critical point in time. There is a high level of awareness of human trafficking, racism, and sexual violence and exploitation in the US. National conversations are taking place about racism and racialized violence (including anti-Asian hate crimes) and about gender-based violence and predatory sexual behaviors. Recent research has increased our understanding of how IMBs operate and their scope and scale. Pending legislation in the Ohio state senate and house provides an opportunity to greatly strengthen Ohio’s response to IMBs (Senate Bill 55 and House Bill 81 (GA134--2021-2022)). This is the time to take action.Read our full report and learn more about Illicit Massage Businesses here.Tony Talbott is the Director of Advocacy at the Human Rights Center and director of Abolition Ohio, the Miami Valley’s Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition.

We assessed 28 municipalities within the greater Dayton area for nine characteristics of strong laws to combat IMBs. Based on our assessment, we produced a set of significant findings about ordinances in the Miami Valley area. The following is an overview of the nine characteristics and the extent to which municipalities adopted these characteristics into their municipal codes.It is important to note that this assessment was conducted with municipal data in 2019. As such, some municipal codes referenced in this section may have changed since we conducted our initial assessment.Characteristics of strong lawsThe first characteristic is reference to unlawful advertisement of massage, which refers to the prohibition of the advertisement of massage with the suggestion or promise of sexual activity. This is also a law referenced in the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). We found that this was the most common characteristic included in legislation regulating massage establishments, with over 75% of municipal codes including this characteristic.The second characteristic is regulation of operating hours, which refers to a municipal code’s restriction of massage establishment operating hours. This is important because many IMBs tend to operate at odd hours in the late night or early morning to obscure illicit activity. Of the 28 municipal codes in our assessment, just over 20% included this characteristic.The third characteristic is clarification of business ownership of massage establishments, which we define as a municipal code’s inclusion of a provision which requires that business owners of massage establishments provide sufficient personal identifiable information to his or her jurisdiction through processes. For example, this could be done through the issuing of a business license or permit. This is so business owners are not able to obscure their identity for the purpose of illicit activity. Of the 28 municipal codes in our assessment, just over 30% of municipalities included this characteristic.The fourth characteristic is regulation of entrances and buzzer-controlled front doors, which we define as a municipal code’s prohibition of aspects of a massage establishment that obscure buyer behavior, such as side-entrances and buzzer-controlled front doors. Of the 28 municipalities in our assessment, none included this characteristic.The fifth characteristic is inspections by applicable city departments, which we define as a municipal code’s inclusion of mandatory requirements for inspections of massage establishments by code enforcers within applicable city departments. Of the 28 municipalities in our assessment, just over 30% of municipalities included this characteristic.The sixth characteristic is reference to the ORC Section 4731.15 requiring massage therapist licensing by the state medical board, which we define as a municipal code’s inclusion of the requirement that massage therapists employed by a massage establishment be licensed by the Ohio State Medical Board. Of the 28 municipalities in our assessment, exactly 25% of municipalities include this characteristic.The seventh characteristic is reference to ORC Section 2907.39, which states that any establishment that employs individuals licensed by the state who engage in medically approved and recognized therapy, including massage therapy, are not adult entertainment or sexual encounter establishments. The inclusion of this language in legislation is critical for the destigmatization of legitimate massage establishments that feed into harmful cultural stereotypes. Of the 28 municipalities in our assessment, just over 40% included this characteristic.The eighth characteristic is refraining from the use of stigmatizing definitions of massage establishments, including defining massage establishments as “sexually oriented businesses”, “adult entertainment establishments”, or the use of similar stigmatizing language to define or categorize massage establishments. We define this characteristic as a municipal code’s exclusion of language which further stigmatizes the massage therapy profession. Of the 28 municipalities in our assessment, just over 30% of municipalities did not utilize such language.Finally, the ninth characteristic is refraining from the use of employee-centered regulations in some municipal codes that further stigmatize the profession of massage. We define this characteristic as a municipal code’s exclusion of employee-centered regulations of massage therapists that further stigmatize the profession in a manner that is not consistent with regulations imposed on other professions. Of the 28 municipalities in our assessment, exactly 50% of municipalities did not use sexual language that stigmatizes the profession of massage.FindingsFirst, legislation that regulates massage businesses in the Miami Valley is clearly inconsistent across municipalities. This provides many opportunities for traffickers to take advantage of municipalities with lax regulations. It is important for municipalities to strengthen their legislation according to some of these characteristics to effectively prevent human trafficking within the larger region. At the same time, strengthening legislation will vary by municipality depending on factors like the size of the municipality and available law enforcement resources.Second, it is important to note that much of the current legislation regulating massage establishments contribute to the stigmatization of the massage profession. This further exacerbates cultural stereotypes that allow IMBs to thrive. Thus, additional legislation that is adopted by these municipalities should be informed by harm reduction. As an advocate explained:“Any municipality aiming to strengthen legislation to reduce the number of IMBs should utilize a harm-reduction strategy which includes the involvement of legitimate massage therapists and business owners located within the jurisdiction of the municipality.”Finally, the city of Dayton, which is the largest municipality within the Miami Valley, does not have a section within its municipal code to regulate massage establishments. It is critical the city adopt a strong policy to combat IMBs and serve as an example of how municipalities can take action to reduce human trafficking.Read our full report and learn more about Illicit Massage Businesses here.Tony Talbott is the Director of Advocacy at the Human Rights Center and director of Abolition Ohio, the Miami Valley’s Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition.

It is estimated there are currently over 10,000 IMBs in the US and approximately 300 in Ohio. In this 3-part blog, members of the Abolition Ohio team share insights from the report, ‘Disrupting Illicit Massage Businesses and Human Trafficking in Ohio’ including the main trends around IMBs today, what the municipal response in the Greater Dayton area has been and a strategy for disruption of this form of human trafficking.Human RightsHuman rights mean that all human beings are entitled to protections regardless of race, age, sex, religion, language, or cultural background. IMBs involve a range of human rights violations and using a human rights framework allows the pervasiveness of exploitation and abuses of victims of IMBs to come to the fore. A human rights framework also provides 1) a more cohesive set of legal tools to be used, 2) a more holistic approach that centers the victims involved and 3) a broader perspective that places the occurrences at IMBs within an international context.The international human rights framework consists of legally binding norms related to IMBs such as the right not to be held in slavery and servitude, including forced labor and imprisonment. Also included is that everyone has the right to work, with free choice of employment, just and favorable work conditions, protection against unemployment, and equal pay and work without distinction to race, color, or national or ethnic origin.RacismRace is a large contributor, along with gender, legal status, and class, to how IMBs operate. Human traffickers target and exploit the vulnerabilities of potential victims; such as poverty, prior victimization, trauma, substance abuse disorders and homelessness. This is not to say that human trafficking only affects a certain sub-group of people, though it is more likely to occur among groups of people who suffer from vulnerabilities. People of color in the US are more likely to live in poverty and are some of the most vulnerable and widely affected groups who are trafficked.Vulnerability based on race and socioeconomic status is evident in respect to IMBs. The victims of IMBs are predominantly female Asian immigrants (Chinese, South Korean, Thai, and Filipino). Many of these women come from impoverished backgrounds and rural communities. A lack of resources leads them to seek opportunities abroad. Many end up immigrating to the US and falling victim to fraudulent debt. Once here, racial discrimination, a lack of social or professional networks and a lack of language skills limit job choices, so they turn to massage as a means to pay off their debt.In addition, we found that racial discrimination and stereotypes are common to IMBs and drive this business. These stereotypes include viewing Asian women as submissive and hyper-sexual. IMBs survive through and perpetuate detrimental attitudes of exoticization and fetishization.COVID-19Our research has also brought to light the way that human trafficking and specifically IMBs have been affected by the global Covid-19 pandemic. Efforts to curtail the spread of the virus unintentionally created an environment in which all forms of human trafficking could thrive. Many public officials in the US, including in Ohio, implemented measures to combat Covid-19, such as restricting travel throughout the US and the globe and closing schools, businesses (including massage establishments) and other public venues where large gatherings are common. These restrictions increased individual and systemic vulnerabilities, such as poverty, unemployment and housing insecurity. This made individuals more susceptible to trafficking and further exacerbated the vulnerabilities of existing human trafficking victims.  Members of migrant communities and low-skilled workers have been disproportionately impacted by these changes.IMBs, which are particularly effective in their networking abilities across the US, quickly adapted to the new climate the pandemic created and took advantage of law enforcement and victim service organizations' setbacks. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the already lucrative and hidden crimes of sex and labor trafficking have become all the more lucrative and hidden.In sum, IMBs are a criminal industry that profits from and perpetuates racism, sexism and societal inequalities. Addressing human trafficking in IMBs from a human rights perspective puts these issues at the forefront of advocacy efforts. As IMBs quickly adapt and change, the work of combatting IMBs must be actively anti-racist, and advocates must work together to find innovative solutions while facing the challenges of a global pandemic.Read our full report and learn more about Illicit Massage Businesses here.Tony Talbott is the Director of Advocacy at the Human Rights Center and director of Abolition Ohio, the Miami Valley’s Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition.

Our Abolition Ohio team took a breath and let things settle for a few weeks. We canceled our next anti-human trafficking coalition meeting and wondered how we’d be able to support all of the important work that still needed to be done in Southwest Ohio and beyond. After holding our first virtual meeting in May, we realized that something was missing. We had been holding in-person anti-human trafficking meetings nearly every month for 10 years. The best parts of those meetings were the informal discussion and networking, the deep, free-ranging conversations about trafficking and related issues, and the ability to engage with other knowledgeable, like-minded, mission-driven folks committed to preventing human trafficking and protecting victims and survivors.We started brainstorming about what we could do. How could we adapt to the “new normal” and turn it to our advantage? We came up with the idea of holding regular, informal, guided dialogue “meet-ups” online, open to our coalition members and the public. We decided to explore different issues connected to human trafficking using small group dialogue and virtual breakout rooms. We wanted a catchy name for the series and came up with “Traffic Talk.”Our first session was held on June 24. The topic was “Understanding Demand Reduction in Sex and Labor Trafficking.” We chose this topic as a basic, starter topic to kick off the series by focusing on demand reduction as a common, evidence-based approach to reducing trafficking. Next, we determined to respond to current events around racial injustice, we created a three-part series on “Race and Human Trafficking.” In part one, we explored the overall issue, including questioning how racial stereotypes impact victimization and how to use your own privilege and power to be an ally with victims, especially with victims from marginalized groups. For part two, we invited Dr. Denise James, Professor of Philosophy and Director of the UD Women and Gender Studies Program, to help us dive deeper into norms and narratives around race. We used Cyntoia Brown-Long’s memoir, Free Cyntoia, as a starting point to discuss concepts around ideal victims and childhood, race, and sexuality. Part three focused on the relationship between race and labor trafficking. We discussed migrant laborers in California’s almond farms and penal labor in the U.S. prison system. Our fifth session further explored human trafficking and the criminal justice system, particularly focusing on policing and the courts. Our sixth and most recent Traffic Talk “Conscious Consumerism & Human Trafficking”, held on October 28th, encouraged participants to begin thinking about their consumer habits before the Christmas shopping season kicked off.Since the start of Traffic Talk in June, over 140 individuals have registered with about 15-20 participants each session. Participants ranged from anti-human trafficking advocates, concerned community members, leaders of key local organizations, and UD students, faculty, and staff from the Greater-Dayton area and beyond.We developed a model for Traffic Talk consisting of a set of brief resources (readings, videos, and podcasts), discussion prompts distributed one or two weeks in advance, a set of guidelines for fostering effective, respectful dialogue, an overview presentation of the issue, and a closing reflection exercise. We open each Traffic Talk with introductions and an overview of the topic for the whole group, then break into small groups for moderator-led discussion. The group comes back together at the end to share out and reflect on the discussions and key takeaways.Planning, coordinating, and hosting this dialogue series did not come without its challenges- as welcome as they were in the spirit of lively community dialogue on issues of the times. These challenges ranged from the technical difficulties inherent in hosting a virtual event to the complexity of fostering constructive dialogue about highly controversial issues. To address these, in part, we invited Traffic Talk participants to provide feedback using Likert scale questions on a scale of one-five (disagree strongly-agree strongly), asking participants to rank variables such as their level of comfortability, their perceived level of meaningfulness during dialogue, and their desire to continue learning about the topics discussed during the event.We used the feedback received to improve on the Traffic Talk experience. For instance, we extended the time of Traffic Talk from one hour to one and a half hours so that participants could have enough time to discuss. We sent out resources earlier than a few days ahead of time. In addition, we invited guest speakers so that those with real-life experience or expertise could provide their perspectives on many of the controversial issues being discussed. Since making these changes, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with participants responding with mostly ‘fives’ on the Likert scale questions.Here are a few of the positive comments we have received:“I love these sessions. I am so glad there is such a diversity of participants. I would like to continue these sessions or extend the length of them if possible.”“Thank you for making this space available. I was definitely uncomfortable during the conversation but I think that is important.”“This was a great session and my group could have talked longer than the assigned time.”After taking a break for the holidays, Traffic Talk will resume in January 2021 on the fourth Wednesday of each month. We have a great slate of upcoming topics to discuss including illicit massage businesses, children’s issues, sex work vs sex trafficking, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our goal is to continue measuring the impact in order to adapt and improve Traffic Talk.

Yet the data show that epidemics tend to lead to an increase in human trafficking while most aid agencies are very busy with other issues and not prepared to also deal with a surge in trafficking. Traffickers exploit the vulnerabilities of their victims and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the vulnerability of many people. These vulnerabilities may be pre-existing (e.g., poverty, belonging to a marginalized group, prior victim of abuse, substance use disorder) or may be manufactured by the trafficker (e.g., abduction and isolation, predatory romantic involvement, fraudulent work contracts).According to US Federal law and international agreements, human trafficking is the commercial exploitation of a person for sex or labor that takes place via force, fraud, or coercion, or the commercial sexual exploitation of a minor. Of the three means of trafficking, fraud is the most commonly used to recruit and control victims. Traffickers prey upon a potential victim’s hopes and dreams or on their desperation. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased uncertainty and exacerbated problems for most people--especially those who already were in precarious situations. Unemployment rates are at historic highs. Alcohol and drug abuse may be increasing. The pandemic is having a negative impact on mental health. Rates of domestic violence and abuse have increased.Here are a few concrete examples of the pandemic’s impact on human trafficking:The loss of income and housing insecurity may lead vulnerable persons, including adolescents and children, to engage in commercial sex or transactional sex--the exchange of sex for needed items or services, such as food or shelter. Many of these situations are actually human trafficking due to the involvement of minors or the presence of force, fraud, or coercion.One consequence of quarantine and stay-at-home orders is a dramatic increase in screen time for adults, teens, and children which leads to an increased exposure to online predators. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children shared that reports to their Cyber Tipline in March were doubled from March 2019.Stay-at-home orders may inadvertently enforce proximity to abusers and exploiters. Some trafficked persons have nowhere else to go. The increased stress and social isolation imposed by the pandemic have led to a spike in domestic abuse across the country and around the world. It is easy to imagine situations where trafficking victims are forced to stay in the same home as their exploiter. Minors often are trafficked by their parents or caregivers. Forced domestic servitude--nannies, housekeepers, au pairs--is already the most common form of labor trafficking in the US.Commercial sexual exploitation is adapting to the pandemic and has continued in spite of the health crisis. There are US and global reports showing a growing number of commercial sex ads that specifically reference coronavirus safety advertising “drive thru” sex or using terms such as masks, gloves, and “virus-free.”Another implication is the transition to remote (online or phone) commercial sex services and a surge in pornography viewing. Pornhub, the largest online porn site, reported a 24% increase in traffic in March when they offered free premium services to countries on lock down. Of course, many performers in porn or online sex are underage or being compelled in some way and thus are victims of human trafficking.Those of us who engage in anti-human trafficking work have also been adversely impacted by the pandemic. In-patient service providers and shelters have been unable to accept new clients in order to protect the health of their already existing clients. Now that restrictions are easing, new clients are being accepted again. In-person outreach to victims, survivors, and those at risk of sex or labor trafficking was suspended in most cases and is only slowly re-starting. While this is welcome news, it is tempered with the realization of the dangers of spreading the virus. Outreach to often hidden populations, such as homeless youth, has been complicated by the closure of most of the usual places they used to congregate. Parks, malls, schools, libraries, drop-in centers, and other venues are empty. But the people who used those locations as safe, social places are still out there.Researchers and law enforcement investigators face similar issues. Many of the standard methods for engaging with at risk populations no longer work. Law enforcement tactics to counter sex trafficking, such as patrols and online stings, have lower success rates because commercial sexual exploitation has declined and there is evidence that some commercial sex operations, such as illicit massage businesses, have moved even further underground during stay-at-home. Researchers who used to rely on in-person interviews and convenience sampling to locate respondents are now up against social distancing guidelines and the closure of public spaces. It is difficult to conduct research remotely because many of the most at risk people do not have regular access to the internet in a safe place.Restrictions on public gatherings has led anti-human trafficking service providers to cancel fundraisers. Foundations and other donors have suspended funding or redirected resources to other needs that have arisen as a result of the pandemic. This leaves many of the nonprofits dealing with victims and survivors short on cash.What can you do?The international community and the US Federal government use the “3-P Paradigm” to guide responses to human trafficking: Prevention, Protection, and Prosecution. The 3-P’s can also help guide individuals and organizations who wish to help.Prevention is key during these uncertain times. Be thoughtful about your own actions. Don’t promote or tolerate commercial sexual exploitation. Make sure that the goods and services you purchase are produced ethically and sustainably.Support the protection of victims and survivors. If you are able, give financial support to a human trafficking service provider in your area. In Ohio, contact your local Anti-Human Trafficking Coalition or search for an organization in close to 200 countries on the Global Modern Slavery Directory.Help law enforcement prosecute traffickers. Learn how to recognize human trafficking and report potential cases to the national hotline (888-373-7888) or your local hotline or police.A fourth “P” often is added to the response paradigm: Partnership. It is only by working together across the public and private sectors: governments, businesses, nonprofits, faith organizations, and individual households that we can truly confront and eliminate human trafficking. During these extraordinarily difficult times we need to develop comprehensive solutions to longstanding systemic injustices. To do so we must come together more than ever to protect the most vulnerable among us.Anthony “Tony” Talbott is a nationally recognized anti human trafficking (AHT) speaker, researcher, advocate, and educator.

IMBs are massage establishments or spas that are often fronts for commercial sex. Also known as erotic massage parlors or Asian massage parlors, these sites are scattered across the country in urban, rural, and suburban areas. IMBs have been the second-leading cause of reports to the National Human Trafficking Hotline over the past few years.Human trafficking is the commercial exploitation of one human being by another by way of force, fraud, or coercion. The purpose of the exploitation can be commercial sex, forced labor, or a combination of the two. The exploitation that occurs at IMBs is a combination of both labor and sex trafficking. Labor trafficking happens when victims are deceived into situations where they are compelled to work long hours for little or no pay, and are often forced to live and remain on site. Sex trafficking occurs when victims are forced or “strongly encouraged” to perform sex acts, colloquially known as “happy endings,” for customers.Clusters of IMBs are often owned by the same individual or network. They operate storefronts in strip malls and commercial districts, advertising “relaxation massage” and often using suggestive photos of young Asian women. Most employ middle-aged Chinese and Korean women as massage providers. These women are immigrants looking for a better life who are often deceived and cruelly exploited. Cultural norms can be manipulated by traffickers to ensure that the women stay under their control out of a sense of duty or obligation. Many suffer through the abuse in order to send remittances back home to their families in China or Korea.Similar to other forms of commercial sexual exploitation, IMBs use the internet to facilitate transactions. Customers search online for details about specific sex acts offered, provider nationalities and body types, and prices on many different IMB review websites. This is a widespread, well organized industry of abuse and exploitation that operates “hidden in plain sight” across the United States, including here in the Greater-Dayton Ohio region.Abolition Ohio 2020Ohio was the first state in the country to regulate the practice of massage. The state medical board licenses all medical and therapeutic massage providers, but non-therapeutic or “relaxation” massage is not covered by the regulation. This loophole has allowed IMBs to spread across the state. Earlier this year we uncovered 247 IMBs advertised or reviewed on commercial sex websites across the state. The ads are explicit and leave no doubt as to their intent.Abolition Ohio 2020State and local law enforcement have responded with dozens of raids, arrests, and investigations related to IMBs, while human rights advocacy organizations have offered assistance and provided outreach in the past few years. The level of effort needed to enact change is grueling; even when actions towards progress appear to be successful, IMBs that are shut down in one location can pop back up in another. The response has been likened to a game of “whack-a-mole.” To truly change the IMB landscape, we need to change our strategy.In a forthcoming report, Abolition Ohio recommends a set of measures to improve the statewide response. This broad set of recommendations was developed based on out of a social scientific understanding of the current systems and structures related to IMBs. The aim is to decrease exploitation and trafficking and reduce the number of IMBs operating in Ohio. They are:Passage of Senate Bill 105 and House Bill 374, “Change Massage Therapy Licensing Law.” These bills would close the “relaxation massage loophole” and require licensing for all massage providers at all establishments. It also gives townships the same power as cities to regulate massage establishments.Updating and strengthening city ordinances to deal with IMBs. This includes removing stigmatizing policy language that treats massage as a sexual business and clarifying ownership of establishments.Training and technical assistance for local law enforcement agencies to improve understanding of the dynamics of IMBs and the exploitation that takes place.Expansion of culturally competent and sensitive outreach and services to victims and at-risk persons. This should include specific measures to protect victims’ autonomy and that wherever possible and appropriate, their specific experiences and voices are incorporated into decisions made on policy and services.Addressing demand for commercial sex through the adoption of strong demand reduction policies. These include both increased fines and enforcement for attempting to purchase commercial sex and public education to shift cultural norms that tolerate commercial sexual exploitation.Tony Talbott is Director of Advocacy at the Human Rights Center.

The Human Rights Center (HRC) and FE began collaborating, with the Hanley Sustainability Institute (HSI), in the Fall 2019 semester. HRC and HSI are working with FE to further their business practices that impact human rights and sustainability.The main strategic vision for this partnership is to collaborate on initiatives to align FE’s business practices towards a triple bottom line: environmental, social, and economic sustainability. These efforts will improve FE’s human rights and sustainability record: creating opportunities for inclusivity in the workforce, mitigating liability in unfavorable business practices, and diversifying customer clientele. These strategies will help FE improve their competitive edge by allowing them to stay current with emerging innovations in the business sector.Hannah Nicholas, came into this partnership as the lead consultant to Flyer Enterprises. Currently working as a Student Engagement Intern at the HRC, Hannah saw this partnership as a critical opportunity to utilize  her background in business and passions for corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and social justice.“The partnership between FE, HRC, and HSI will not only help FE gain further leverage against large corporate competitors, but it will also serve as a prime example of how student-run businesses can make positive environmental, social, and economic change within our communities,” says Hannah.Many businesses are starting to incorporate a triple bottom line approach  that is guided by the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. The Global Compact’s two goals are to 1) Do business responsibly by aligning strategies and operations with Ten Principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption; and 2) Take strategic actions to advance broader societal goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with an emphasis on collaboration and innovation.The partnership believes that FE could be at the forefront of student-run organizations making this transition that corporations worldwide are undergoing. To ensure this success of the business, the partnership is focusing on addressing: equity, inclusion and diversity in hiring practices, code of vendor and supplier conduct policies, waste management (including recycling, landfill, and compost), use of the green revolving fund for reusable dishware and sanitation systems, and employee education. FE has also consulted with the Multi-Ethnic Education and Engagement Center (MEC) and the L. William Crotty Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership."Working with the HRC has been incredibly beneficial for FE so far. We are always looking for innovative ways to bring value to our communities. Recently, we have been working on hiring practices that emphasize the need for diversity in the workplace. HRC have been gracious enough to share their expertise with FE and help us grow in the right directions,” said Collin Wolf, FE Chief Marketing OfficerBoth HRC and HSI offer innovative students and resources uniquely positioned to respond to this work. They both have student employees working on this collaboration with the classroom and professional experience needed for  the project, while leveraging the support from faculty and staff in the centers.“It has been rewarding to be one of the collaborators on this initiative through the Hanley Sustainability Institute. It’s been a joy to take part in the exchange of ideas between Flyer Enterprises, the Human Rights Center, and the Hanley Sustainability Institute, and I’m looking forward to continuing these efforts in the fall. As an alum of Flyer Enterprises, it’s also very exciting for me to see FE’s executive team continue to innovate their practices in a way that so proudly exhibits the mission of the University of Dayton and the SDGs,” explained  Lauren Wolford, a Graduate Assistant at HSI.Due to the emerging crisis caused by COVID-19, the team has paused implementation of recycling and compost education and operation initiatives that were set to begin late March. Now, due to the current situation, the HRC and HSI team is conducting research to develop virtual materials and policy in preparation for implementation of onboarding of FE employees in Fall 2020. The education materials being developed will outline specific short term and long term goals that will be implemented within each FE division. By creating and presenting these educational resources, the team hopes to start to inform and equip all FE employees with a  toolkit on how to effectively implement new environmental, social, and economic sustainability initiatives within their every day line of work.We hope this work will serve as a basis for the partnership to support FE to meet human rights and sustainability standards and we look forward to growing and expanding this initiative in the coming years.Hannah Nicholas’ 20 is pursuing a B.S. in Finance and Operations and Supply Chain Management, graduating in December of 2020.

Nonetheless, the virtual National Fair Trade Conference was an incredible opportunity to learn from movement leaders and industry experts that are currently driving social innovation and sustainable development. It was also a good time to connect with other campus organizers and brainstorm ideas to further promote fair trade advocacy. While in-person events and conferences can be an excellent way to distribute content, shifting to a virtual platform allowed us to watch every breakout session that was presented throughout the week. Also, by transforming the conference into a virtual event, we as representatives of the University of Dayton were able to expand our reach and promote brand awareness to a broader audience than ever before.This year, our team presented on the implementation and promotion of fair trade practices on our campus. As a fair trade designated university, faculty and student advocates are consistently working to further our impact and spread awareness of what fair trade designation means and why it is important. In spring 2019, the fair trade coalition organized a Clothing Swap on campus in which students were invited to drop-off unwanted clothes at locations across campus. On the night of the event, the students who had donated clothes could pick out any clothes they wanted based upon how much they donated to the event. From the success of the first Clothing Swap, we decided to make it a regular occurrence each semester.The goal of the Clothing Swap event is not only to promote ethical and sustainable shopping habits but also to educate attendees about fair trade. We presented the initiative at the conference to share our process, takeaways, and recommendations for maximizing the reach and impact. Presenting at the conference allowed us to reflect on and evaluate our operations and provided us the opportunity to collaborate with and gain insight from individuals working on similar initiatives at universities across the country. From ‘Fix It Fridays’ at Illinois State University to ‘Wear Justice’ at Point Loma Nazarene University, we acquired valuable knowledge on how to effectively implement fair trade initiatives on a college campus. We are excited to bring back this wisdom as we continue to advocate for fair trade.This year’s Fair Trade Conference recognized some of the fantastic innovations and trends throughout the Fair Trade World. Sarah DeLang from The World Fair Trade Organization shared some remarkable statistics demonstrating the trends happening within Fair Trade. To begin, 52% of Fair Trade organizations are led by a female CEO, which is monumental when compared to the 8% found throughout all businesses. This is partly because Fair Trade organizations place a high value on diversity and inclusion and are trying to be an example for businesses all across the world. Another interesting statistic is that 92% of Fair Trade businesses reinvest their profits into their social missions, which is a practice that is not standard in most businesses. Fair Trade organizations are also typically working with marginalized populations in undesirable environments; however, despite these odds, they are four times less likely to go bankrupt. The work of Fair Trade is tough, but the leaders are creative, passionate, and mission-driven, which has led them to find success despite the challenges they face. Fair Trade organizations are leaders in their industries and are reinventing business practices. They place a high value on their workers and sustainability, while also continuing to make a profit and innovate. This is why Paul Rice from Fair Trade USA has called this type of business a “win, win, win.”However, the work of Fair Trade is only beginning. Stephanie Lopez, The University of California’s Special Programs Manager for Procurement Services, discussed some of the innovations UC is working on, such as creating databases to find ethical and sustainable products, requiring ethical purchasing training for all procurement positions, and creating a scorecard to measure all outside suppliers. Vik Giri, founder, and CEO of Gallant, talked about the increase of organic cotton he has seen over the years and how he is making strides by creating affordable and organic/natural cotton-based products. These are just a few examples of the innovative minds working in the Fair Trade world. Over the years, With the use of technological advocacy, Fair Trade leaders are hoping to spread this movement, encourage innovation, and remain leaders in the commercial world.Elizabeth Segran began the opening breakouts by explaining how activism is a lifelong skill that can lead us not only to social change but to a fulfilling job. This idea is embodied by Alexandra Villasenor, who shared her experience as a student activist and how she is using the unprecedented time to be present with herself and innovative with her work. Funmiola Fagbamilia focused her keynote on the intersection of activism and self-care, invoking Audre Lorde’s idea that self-care in of itself is an act of political warfare. Funmiola performed her own spoken word, which inspired the audience to be introspective about their activism and acceptance of others' own forms of activism so we can build a unified force with which to fight inequality. This flowed into Paul Rice’s closing, “We are as vulnerable as the most vulnerable among us.” Fighting for just systems, whether through Fair Trade initiatives or other forms of activism, not only empowers the most vulnerable, but is also an act of self-care.From the initial breakouts to the closing discussion, the importance of personal growth and well-being were highlighted throughout the conference. Perhaps this was due to the personal struggles we are all facing as we deal with the societal impacts of COVID-19, or perhaps as an illustration of a broader zeitgeist. Activism, growth, and wellbeing are intersectional and interdependent. Dedicating meaningful time to each can help us achieve more equitable systems as well as develop as individuals.Jillian DeWitt is a senior Operations and Supply Chain student and is also pursuing a Nonprofit and Community Leadership Graduate Certificate.Jenn Hoody is a senior Mechanical Engineering student with a minor in Sustainability, Energy, & the Environment.Hannah Nicholas is a senior Finance and Operations and Supply Chain Management student at the University of Dayton.Emily Shanahan is a senior International Business Management student with minors in Sustainability, Energy, and the Environment, and Human Rights Studies.Read our BlogCONTACTAbolition OhioKeller Hall, Room 455300 College ParkDayton, Ohio 45469 - 2790937-229-4326EmailCONNECTfacebookinstagramtwitteryoutubeGet Involved The driving force behind the Center is a diverse group of dedicated faculty, staff, and students each bringing their own expertise and knowledge to our work in the human rights arena.HRC Jobs and Funding OpportunitiesHome300 College ParkDayton,Ohio45469937-229-1000info@udayton.eduDirectionsApplyVisitRequest InfoGiveFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinkedInCareersContactAcademic CalendarAlumniLibrariesPORCHESPOLICIESREPORT A CONCERNPRIVACY & TERMSNONDISCRIMINATIONDIVERSITY
