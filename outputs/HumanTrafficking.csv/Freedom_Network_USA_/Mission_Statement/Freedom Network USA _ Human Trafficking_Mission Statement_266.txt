Protecting the rights of each individual survivor is the only path to restoring their dignity and giving them the opportunity they deserve to pursue a better life. This commitment to human rights ties the network together as it works toward the common goal of ending human trafficking.Our Mission, in MotionFreedom Network USA is the nation’s largest coalition working to ensure that trafficked persons have access to justice, safety, and opportunity.Established in 2001, the network is comprised of trafficking survivors, legal and social service providers, researchers, advocacy organizations, and expert consultants. Our perspective is derived from the diverse geographic scope and expertise that our members bring from working with survivors of labor and sex trafficking. Together we influence policy, provide training and technical assistance, and increase the capacity of members and allies.Our TeamJean BruggemanExecutive DirectorKaren RomeroSenior Director of TrainingMelinda SmithDirector of PartnershipsCarrie EischeidFNTI Housing Project ManagerAlana JonesFreedom Network Training Institute (FNTI) CoordinatorTatiana TorresTraining SpecialistCiara Dacosta-ReyesTraining SpecialistShakeria DominiqueTraining SpecialistMeg HugheyResource SpecialistAmanda NorwoodOperations SpecialistHaley EppingCommunications CoordinatorTerri WaldronMembership CoordinatorPhu PhamFinance ManagerMiranda NehrigStaff AttorneyErika PalaciosSenior Development & Communications SpecialistCassandra EngTraining SpecialistEmma EckerSenior Policy SpecialistOur BoardKeisha StanfordRebecca MiddletonShakthi KumarRenee CarrAlen AminiCurtis SchehrIvana GargiuloRebecca ClarReportsImpact ReportsOur Impact Report provides a snapshot of the work accomplished over the previous year.
