Today, the President signed the package that reauthorizes critical funding for services and support for trafficking survivors in the US through 2021. Freedom Network USA thanks the members of Congress, and their staff, who worked with us for the past two years on this legislation.The US has dramatically improved its approach to human trafficking since the enactment of the TVPA in 2000. However, these gains are being undermined by the inhumane policies of the current Administration. Traffickers target immigrants, LGBTQ youth, and survivors of trauma and abuse. Policies that demonize, restrict access to protection and support, and restrict needed services and support leave victims trapped in abusive and exploitive conditions.FNUSA calls on the Administration to dismantle the structures of oppression, discrimination, and violence that are protecting traffickers. We call on the Administration to protect migrants from all forms of abuse and exploitation, ensure a fair judicial system, protect families, and respect the human rights of all people. Protecting human rights is the only effective way to end human trafficking in the US.We look forward to continued collaboration with congressional leaders on this important issue. FNUSA, and our allies, will continue to fight policies and practices that have a negative impact on those who have experienced human trafficking.Contact UsFreedom Network USA712 H St NE, Suite 1667Washington, DC 20002202-768-7338PRESS KIT© 2022 Freedom Network USA
