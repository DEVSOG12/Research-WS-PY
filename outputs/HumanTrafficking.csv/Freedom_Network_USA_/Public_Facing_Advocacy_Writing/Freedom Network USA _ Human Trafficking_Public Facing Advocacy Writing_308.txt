Released annually by the Office to Combat and Monitor Trafficking in Persons (JTIP), this report ranks countries around the world on efforts to combat human trafficking and is used as a benchmark and diplomatic tool throughout the year to engage governments on this issue. As the largest coalition of anti-trafficking experts in the country, FNUSA proudly submits comments annually to inform and evaluate the anti-trafficking efforts of the US government.Since the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000, the US government has made some progress in ensuring survivors have access to holistic services that help in preventing this horrible crime. There is still much more work to be done, especially under an Administration that has waged an all-out assault on vulnerable populations. Specifically, FNUSA provided comments in three issues areas:Enforcement of Anti-Trafficking Laws and Prosecution EffortsService Provision, Treatment, and Protection of Human Trafficking SurvivorsThe US Government’s Failure to Prevent Human Trafficking Among MarginalizedCommunitiesWe applaud JTIP for continuing to solicit feedback from the field and look forward to working collaboratively in 2019.You can read our comments from previous years here.Contact UsFreedom Network USA712 H St NE, Suite 1667Washington, DC 20002202-768-7338PRESS KIT© 2022 Freedom Network USA
