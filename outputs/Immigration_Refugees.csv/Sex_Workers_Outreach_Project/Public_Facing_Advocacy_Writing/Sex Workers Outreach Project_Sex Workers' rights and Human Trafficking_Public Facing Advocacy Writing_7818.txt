I realized that the changes I wanted to see for marginalized sex workers meant big moves and I wanted to be somewhere I could make that happen.What are you most excited about?I am incredibly hype, having 3 black executive directors sounds like a dream. We all come from different places and have different experiences to bring to the table. I know we are going to do some amazing things together,What do you think the biggest areas of growth for the organization are?SWOP has a reputation for being very white, not being intersectional. Restorative Justice starts with changing the folks who are supposed to represent the people we serve. There are nuanced things that only marginalized people can speak to. It’s really important to me that we start that path the right way and changing the staff is a beautiful first step.Which of your talents or skills are you most looking forward to utilizing at SWOP?I love talking to people and after my lived experience as a sex worker, I have a unique viewpoint that will help aid in chapter support. I’m as calm as a kindergarten teacher and sometimes, that’s the only superpower I need.Where do you hope to see SWOP in 2 years?In an ideal world, I would love to see more chapters serving rural areas, more chapters in major cities, and teaming up with other nonprofit wizards to expand outreach.What are three influential books in your life or work?“Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life” – Dr. Marshall Rosenberg“You Can’t Touch My Hair: And Other Things I Still Have to Explain” – Phoebe Robinson“Unfuck Yourself” – John BishopWhat are you listening to (music, podcasts, etc) or watching (TV, Movies, etc.) right now?Honestly, my Spotify is embarrassing, DO NOT PASS ME THE AUX CABLE. I listen to everything from Dolly Parton to ScHoolboy Q. At the moment I just finished the new Run the Jewels album (“Out of Sight (feat 2 Chainz)”), I’ve been on a 90s R&B kick (joe, Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men, Brandy, Monica, Mariah, & Whitney). Nina Dioz (“Salsa”)has an incredible album and it’s been on rotation for several weeks.I watched all of Insecure, I watch these youtube videos of two people building underground pools, I love a good youtube wormhole, Rick & Morty, Boondocks, Tyler Perry movies- so many Tyler Perry Movies, anything silly with a good soundtrack is always a winner.What does downtime, rejuvenation, self/community-care look for you?In my downtime, I try to unplug from social media and watch something I don’t have to try very hard to enjoy. I love kicking back outside (after the sun goes down) and watching the sky change colors. I love cooking for the folks in my small town, if I have the privilege of groceries, I’m feeding all the babies.Any favorite gifs or memes you want to share?via GIPHYBy Christa Daring|2020-06-15T15:53:45+00:00June 15th, 2020|Announcements, Blogs|Comments Off on Staff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInWhatsAppTumblrPinterestVkEmailAbout the Author: 						Christa DaringRelated PostsSWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsGallerySWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)Staff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)International Women’s Day Statement 2020International Women’s Day Statement 2020SWOP-USA Hiring: Executive DirectorSWOP-USA Hiring: Executive DirectorSearch for:Subscribe to our mailing list-->CategoriesAnnouncementsBillsBlogsCall to actionDays of ObservanceEducationalEventsFact SheetsFund RaisingHear Our VoiceInformationLegislationNewsPrint OutsResearchResearch SummaryUncategorizedArchivesAugust 2020June 2020March 2020January 2020November 2019October 2019August 2019June 2019May 2019March 2019February 2019September 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014Find us on FacebookPopularRecentCommentsMale Sex Workers Condemn Raid on RentBoy.comAugust 28th, 2015Trans Day of Remembrance Statement & Fact SheetNovember 12th, 2015PEPFAR Consultation – Urgent Feedback from Sex Worker Stakeholders Needed!November 15th, 2015SWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsAugust 24th, 2020Call To Action!
