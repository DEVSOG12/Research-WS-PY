It just makes sense to officially join an organization doing work I have admired for so long.What are you most excited about?I love and crave being in space with other sex workers and organizers — it’s where I feel most at ease. I’m also looking forward to being in a professional setting that is actively addressing systems of violence and working for the most oppressed. This work gives me purpose.What do you think the biggest areas of growth for the organization are?Rekindling its relationship with the sex working community.Which of your talents or skills are you most looking forward to utilizing at SWOP?I have years of organizing as well as non-profit management experience. I think SWOP is a dynamic place that will allow me to showcase both my grassroots and institutional skills.What are three influential books in your life or work?“The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State” by Friedrich Engels“Sister Outsider” by Audre Lorde“The Black Femnist Thought” by Patricia Hill CollinsWhat are you listening to (music, podcasts, etc.) or watching (TV, movies, etc.) right now?Podcasts — How Stuff Works: two mediocre yt guys talking about everything. It’s entertaining.TV — I just started watching The Office for the first time. It’s annoying but makes good background noise.Movies — I’m about to rewatch Clueless because Paul Rudd is my favorite white manWhat does downtime, rejuvenation, self/community-care look for you?Knitting, cuddling my cats, journaling, making mimosas and watching House Hunters.Any favorite gifs or memes you want to share?By Christa Daring|2020-06-15T15:52:44+00:00June 15th, 2020|Announcements, Blogs|Comments Off on Staff Profile: Velvet (Managing Director)Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedInWhatsAppTumblrPinterestVkEmailAbout the Author: 						Christa DaringRelated PostsSWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsGallerySWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Phoenix Calida (Communications Director)Staff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)GalleryStaff Profile: Alexandria LaRue (Chapter Director)International Women’s Day Statement 2020International Women’s Day Statement 2020SWOP-USA Hiring: Executive DirectorSWOP-USA Hiring: Executive DirectorSearch for:Subscribe to our mailing list-->CategoriesAnnouncementsBillsBlogsCall to actionDays of ObservanceEducationalEventsFact SheetsFund RaisingHear Our VoiceInformationLegislationNewsPrint OutsResearchResearch SummaryUncategorizedArchivesAugust 2020June 2020March 2020January 2020November 2019October 2019August 2019June 2019May 2019March 2019February 2019September 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017November 2016October 2016September 2016August 2016July 2016June 2016May 2016April 2016March 2016February 2016January 2016December 2015November 2015October 2015September 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015February 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014Find us on FacebookPopularRecentCommentsMale Sex Workers Condemn Raid on RentBoy.comAugust 28th, 2015Trans Day of Remembrance Statement & Fact SheetNovember 12th, 2015PEPFAR Consultation – Urgent Feedback from Sex Worker Stakeholders Needed!November 15th, 2015SWOP-USA Is Looking To Expand The Board Of DirectorsAugust 24th, 2020Call To Action!
