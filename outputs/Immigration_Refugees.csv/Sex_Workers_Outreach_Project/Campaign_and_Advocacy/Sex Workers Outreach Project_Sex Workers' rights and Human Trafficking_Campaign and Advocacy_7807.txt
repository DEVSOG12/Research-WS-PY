Tell your senator to vote against the #EarnIt ActHome/Uncategorized/Call To Action! Tell your senator to vote against the #EarnIt ActPrevious NextCall To Action! Tell your senator to vote against the #EarnIt ActWe need everyone to call or email their senators Thursday, to tell them to oppose the Earn It Act. The sex worker collective Hacking/Hustling explains why:Why are we saying #FUCKEARNIT?EARN IT would create a group of law enforcement, tech reps and service providers who work on the issue of child abuse to come up with regulations for the internet. Some have already been vocal about wanting to kill user encryption (do you use Signal?). It’s many of the same actors and approaches that brought you SESTA, with an even broader mandate. For more information, check out the Hacking//Hustling page on EARN IT, with a webinar recording, section-by-section explainer of the bill, and more.Senators who are voting next week:This is the last step before EARN IT heads to the Senate floor, which means not every Senator is voting yet.
