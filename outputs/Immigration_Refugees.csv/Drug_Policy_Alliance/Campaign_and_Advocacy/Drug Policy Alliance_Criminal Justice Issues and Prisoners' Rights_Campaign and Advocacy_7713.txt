COVID-19 has disrupted markets, further exacerbating economic instability and increasing the risk of COVID-19 and police aggression and violence.This is the fifth in a series of seven discussions that DPA held on COVID-19 and drug policy. These discussions bring together advocates and allies in the justice reform movement to discuss how we can sustain progress, which obstacles still remain, and how we can use the current moment to be more aspirational with our policy agendas.Speakers:Leila Raven, DecrimNYCaty Simon, Urban Survivors UnionTamika Spellman, HIPSNik Theodore, University of ChicagoModerator:Aliza Cohen, Drug Policy AllianceWatch more of this discussion series.Criminal Justice ReformPolicingVideoCOVID-19Featured ResourcesEnd No-Knock Warrants and Militarized Quick-Knock RaidsDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemMember NewsletterMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release10.13.22Civil Rights Groups, Policy Experts Welcome Sen.
