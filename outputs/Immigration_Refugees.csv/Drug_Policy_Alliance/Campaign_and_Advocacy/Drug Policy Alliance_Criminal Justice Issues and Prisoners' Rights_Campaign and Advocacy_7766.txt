Tell the Senate: Strengthen the Justice in Policing Act | Drug Policy AllianceSkip to main contentTell the Senate: Strengthen the Justice in Policing ActItâ€™s been one year since the police killing of George Floyd yet real federal reform still lags behind despite promises by Congress and the Biden administration to act.The U.S. House passed the Justice in Policing Act, but it does not go nearly far enough to save lives. It does not fully address police militarization and quick-knock raids, policing practices that are disproportionately used against people of color in drug investigations. It also continues to over-invest in police departments and the war on drugs, rather than shift resources to education, housing, harm reduction, and other services to keep communities safe.The Senate is negotiating the bill right now: tell your Senators to strengthen the bill and end deadly policing practices fueled by the drug war.Take ActionYour MessageSubjectStrengthen the Justice in Policing ActDear Senator,Message BodyThe Justice in Policing Act passed by the House fails to provide for real reform and accountability. I urge the Senate to strengthen this bill by working alongside advocates and community members to craft a comprehensive police reform bill that will hold law enforcement accountable, protect our communities and ensure dignity and respect for Black, Latinx and Indigenous lives.Notably, the Justice in Policing Act fails to fully address issues like police militarization and quick-knock raids, policing practices that are disproportionately used against people of color in drug investigations. While the bill places restrictions on programs that facilitate the transfer of military equipment to local police departments, it does not outright put an end to such programs. And while this bill prohibits no-knock warrants for drug cases, it does not outlaw quick-knock raids which can be just as deadly. Moreover, the bill continues to over-invest in police departments and the war on drugs, rather than shift resources to education, housing, harm reduction services, and other infrastructure that strengthens communities and increases public safety.I urge the Senate to act swiftly on police reform and strengthen the Justice in Policing Act including ending quick-knock raids and ending programs that facilitate the transfer of military equipment to local police departments as these tactics are disproportionately used against people of color when police investigate drug cases.Now is the time for Congress to pass meaningful legislation to protect communities from the systemic perils of over-policing, police brutality, misconduct, and harassment, and end the impunity with which officers operate in taking the lives of Black and Brown people.Sincerely,[First Name] [Last Name][Your Address]Your InformationSalutation *- Select -MrMrsMsMissDrFirst name *Last name *E-mail address *Address *Address Line 2City *State *- Select -AlabamaAlaskaAmerican SamoaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDistrict of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaGuamHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarshall IslandsMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaNorthern Marianas IslandsOhioOklahomaOregonPalauPennsylvaniaPuerto RicoRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirgin IslandsVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingZip Code *Phone* Drug Policy Alliance is committed to protecting your privacy and will never share your email address.If you sign and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.If you take action and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.If you donate and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from the Drug Policy Alliance.SiteMapContactUsTerms& ConditionsPrivacyPolicy
