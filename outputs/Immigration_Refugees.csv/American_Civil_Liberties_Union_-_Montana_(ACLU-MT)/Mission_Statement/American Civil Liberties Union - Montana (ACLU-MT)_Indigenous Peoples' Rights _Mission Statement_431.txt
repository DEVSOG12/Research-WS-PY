In our Montana, everybody is treated with dignity and respect, and has equal access to rights and freedoms. We work to hold the government accountable to all who live in Montana, with a particular focus on those who have been historically (or continue to be) disenfranchised, including Indigenous people and people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ individuals and families, the poor, and those with disabilities.Our top priorities are to reform the criminal legal system and uphold Indigenous justice. We also work to protect the rights of immigrants, safeguard reproductive freedom, celebrate LGBTQ people and families, ensure voting rights, protect free speech, and more.Stay informed!
