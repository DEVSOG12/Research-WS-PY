BarrientosCASE STATUSActiveHUMAN RIGHTS ISSUESCrimes Against Humanity, Summary Execution, TortureCOUNTRYChileClientsPerpetratorsPressPartnersRelated ResourcesCASE STATUSActiveHUMAN RIGHTS ISSUESCrimes Against Humanity, Summary Execution, TortureCOUNTRYChileFollowing a bloody coup that toppled Chile’s democratically elected government, General Augusto Pinochet’s regime executed or disappeared more than 3,200 people, and detained and tortured over 30,000 more. Legendary folk singer Víctor Jara was among the murdered. While Pinochet’s regime ended in 1988, decades went by as those who tortured and murdered Jara – and thousands of others – remained unidentified. CJA represents the family of Víctor Jara to bring to justice the individual responsible for his death.In 1973, Víctor Jara was one of Chile’s biggest music stars, famous for his outspoken messages of social equality and the plight of the working class. When the right-wing Pinochet regime seized power, Jara was one of the first to be singled out.Just one day after the coup, military troops took control of the university where Jara taught.Jara, along with hundreds of other students, professors, and staff members, was taken to Chile Stadium, the most notorious mass detention center run by the new dictatorship. Jara was interrogated and tortured before being shot 44 times: a warning to those who challenged Pinochet’s authority.Chile Stadium was later renamed in honor of Jara. Yet for decades justice remained elusive. Jara remains the most potent symbol of a nation struggling to find peace with itself more than two decades since the return of democracy.Finally, in 2009, former soldiers broke their long-held silence about the atrocities of Chile Stadium, including information about the killing of Jara. In a Chilean court, prosecutors indicted 10 former military officials. One of the men was Pedro Barrientos Núñez, the former lieutenant alleged to have participated in the killing of Jara. While the other former military officials remained in Chile, Barrientos had moved to Florida, beyond the reach of Chilean courts.That’s where CJA stepped in.In September 2013, on behalf of Jara’s widow and children, CJA filed a civil suit in a Florida court against Barrientos on claims of torture and extrajudicial killing. The suit seeks to hold Barrientos accountable for Jara’s torture and murder. Barrientos argued that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction, but in April 2015, the court ordered the case to move forward.CJA has been instrumental in reconstructing the story of what happened in the first days after the coup, as these events have remained shrouded in mystery for over 40 years. The case, along with the work of Chilean prosecutors who have indicted Barrientos, will finally provide judicial acknowledgement to the victims of Chile Stadium.The trial for Jara v. Barrientos began in Orlando, Florida on June 13, 2016. To read a full summary of the trial, please click here. The jury delivered their verdict on June 27, 2016, declaring Barrientos liable for his involvement in Jara’s torture and murder. He was ordered to pay Jara’s estate and family $28 million in compensatory and punitive damages.Legal Actions & Related ProjectsClientsPerpetratorsPressPartnersRelated ResourcesCenter for Justice and Accountability268 Bush St #3432San Francisco, CA 94104T: 415 544 0444F: 415 544 0456FacebookTwitterYouTubeLinkedInFlickrSnapchatAbout UsAnnual ReportsFinancesPrivacy PolicyContact UsBecome a SupporterDonateJustice CircleWays to GiveEventsResourcesCJA In The NewsNewslettersLegal GlossaryArchivesSign Up For Updates From CJACopyright © 2022Photo creditsXSign up for updatesEmail*First Name* Last Name* Country*AfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarrussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCongo, Democratic Republic of theCongo, Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (Swaziland)EthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard and McDonald IslandsHoly SeeHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth GeorgiaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen IslandsSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUruguayUS Minor Outlying IslandsUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweCAPTCHAΔX×We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
