The actual killer of hostage Officer Vallandingham was a less prominent prisoner who turned informant for the State named Anthony Lavelle. The amicus brief summarizes the testimony of fourteen different prisoners who witnessed Lavelle recruit a death squad, discuss why an officer should be killed, enter the area where the officer was confined to do the killing, and boast of the killing afterwards.To support the false conviction of Hasan, according to the brief, prosecutors then recruited a prisoner named Kenneth Law to present perjured testimony. They threatened Law with trial for murder if he did not say what the State wanted. When Law told prosecutors that the murderer was Lavelle, Law said they responded that his “story would have to change, because Lavelle was a state witness.”“The death penalty is a horrible practice, but if the state insists on imposing it, they should be sure that the person is guilty,” concluded Lynd. “There is considerable evidence Mr. Hasan is innocent and because of his death sentence it is even more imperative the state drops this wrongful conviction.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesDeath PenaltyRelated contentAhead of Easter and Passover, Let’s Remember that Abolishing Ohio’s...April 12, 2022Death Penalty Repeal is a Racial Justice IssueFebruary 25, 2022House Bill 183 - Proponent TestimonyNovember 18, 2021ACLU of Ohio Places Death Penalty Repeal Billboard Advertisement in...August 18, 2021The Push for Death Penalty Repeal in OhioJune 9, 2021Repealing the Death Penalty May 27, 2021House Bill 8 – Proponent TestimonyMarch 10, 2021How Ohioans Feel About The Death PenaltyMarch 8, 20212020 Was A Lot.
