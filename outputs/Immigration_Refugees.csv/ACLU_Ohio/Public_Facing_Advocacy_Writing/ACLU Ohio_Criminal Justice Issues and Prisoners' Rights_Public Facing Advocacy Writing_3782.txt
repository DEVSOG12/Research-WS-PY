Ariel Castro was convicted of heinous crimes for which he deserved to be punished. With that in mind, his suicide just one month into his sentence does not fill the public with a great deal of grief.But it was not justice.Looking beyond the visceral reaction we have toward Castro and his crimes, it becomes obvious that suicide in prison is a serious problem, a problem much bigger than any one inmate.Castro’s suicide is the seventh this year in Ohio prisons and the 33rd suicide since 2008. In local jails the problem is even worse. A 2005 study found that suicide accounted for 32 percent of all jail deaths. Nationwide, suicide kills more inmates than homicides, drug overdoses, and accidents combined.Numbers that high are a problem.As numerous media outlets have pointed out, the call for an investigation into Castro’s suicide is really a call to ask the hard questions about how we administer our jails and prisons. Because regardless of how you feel about these people taking their own lives, it is clear that it’s not supposed to be happening while they are in government custody.When a person is imprisoned, the criminal justice system takes on a basic responsibility to see that justice is administered in accordance with the law.Not vigilante revenge. Not self-administered judgment. Justice.Like homicides, overdoses and accidents, it isn’t always easy for jails or prisons to prevent suicides, but it is very important that they do everything they possibly can to try. Anything less creates a breakdown, and a broken system will eventually become just as dangerous for guards and administrators as it is for inmates.Some may be content to write off suicide the way they write off other prison problems like gang activity, drug trafficking, and rampant sexual abuse. After all, they affect a population for which many don’t feel any sympathy.But our system is not about sympathy, or anger, or any other emotion.  It’s about justice—a concept based on the rule of law.A case like Ariel Castro’s may inflame our emotions, but deep down we know we are a nation of laws, and that those laws must be administered to the absolute best of our ability, regardless of how we feel about the people who break them.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
