The plaintiffs, the Fair Housing Center for Rights & Research and Beverley Somai, filed a lawsuit on February 20, 2019 alleging that Bedford’s Nuisance Ordinance violates the First Amendment by penalizing people for calling the police for help—and is used to discriminate against communities of color, low-income households, people with disabilities, and domestic violence survivors.“A call for help should never result in eviction. No one’s housing should be at risk simply because they called 911. Bedford’s law and other nuisance laws like it don’t benefit anyone—they are used to exclude and mistreat people. We are pleased that the City agreed to a preliminary injunction. We will continue fighting for the ordinance to be repealed for good,” said Elizabeth Bonham, staff attorney for the ACLU of Ohio.Courts across the country have found that local nuisance ordinances violate residents’ rights under the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because they punish people for reaching out to their governments, often without notice or an opportunity to challenge whether they should be considered a “nuisance.”“Bedford’s nuisance ordinance does not further any legitimate public safety goals, it actually harms public safety by penalizing victims of crime and other people who require emergency assistance,” added Jennifer Sheehe, attorney for The Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. “Our clients' experience is far from an anomaly. Bedford’s broad, discriminatory, punitive ordinance should be permanently struck down."Read the stipulation.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDocumentspdfSomai-v-Bedford_StipulationAndProposedOrderGrantingPreliminaryInjunction-CriminalActivityNuisancesOrdinance_2019-0722.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
