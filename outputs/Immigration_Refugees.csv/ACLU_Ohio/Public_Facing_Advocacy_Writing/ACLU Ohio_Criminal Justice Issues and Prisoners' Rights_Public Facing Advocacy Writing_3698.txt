Senate Bill 18. This was delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 23, 2019.To Chairman Eklund, Vice Chair Manning, Ranking Member Thomas, and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, thank you for this opportunity to present proponent testimony on Substitute Senate Bill 18.You have previously heard from a wide range of proponents advocating for this bill. The ACLU of Ohio is pleased to add its own support. SB 18 has been repeatedly described as "common sense" and, indeed, it is exactly that and more.States continue to pass legislation of this type and similar protections are included in the federal First Step Act. SB 18 also reflects the current practices of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction. I know DRC's involvement and perspective throughout this legislative process has been very helpful.These changes occur in Ohio and across the country out ofrecognition shackling, restraining or confining incarcerated and accused pregnant women is more than unnecessary. It is harmful. It is a physical barrier to providing proper medical care in numerous ways. It is traumatizing. It is dehumanizing.While SB 18 is most welcome, let us also  not forget this general situation can be improved further through the passage of both Senate Bill 3  and House Bill 1, plus meaningful bail reform. That is, let's reduce and end the reasons Ohioans are incarcerated in the first place. It is the failed War on Drugs that has directly led to dramatic increases in the number of women incarcerated here and elsewhere.Finally, we thank all of those who have worked to make SB 18 a reality. This is important legislation that will positively benefit your constituents and Ohio more than you realize. The ACLU of Ohio encourages this committee's support.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
