This bill reinforces the extremely flawed “Statehouse to Prison Pipeline” and bolsters the failed policies of the War on Drugs. The ACLU of Ohio and the Office of the Public Defender oppose this bill and urge members of the committee to cast a “no” vote.The following statement is attributable to Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio:“Senate Bill 55 represents everything wrong with Ohio lawmaker’s approach to criminal justice reform, or the lack thereof. If this bill is passed it will erase the positive gains that Senate Bill 3 and House Bill 1 could bring if and when they are passed. Legislators often bemoan the number of people behind bars in Ohio.  Yet, they fail to realize it is their own actions, via the numerous bills they pass to create new crimes & enhance sentences that is the driving factor behind Ohio’s mass incarceration crisis.  If Ohio legislators are truly serious about ending the thoroughly failed War on Drugs, they must reject harmful & destructive bills like SB 55.”###The full testimony for SB 55 is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
