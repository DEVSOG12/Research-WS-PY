If you didn’t have a mental illness going into isolation, it’s likely you will have one coming out.Research shows that prolonged solitary causes a persistent and heightened state of anxiety, nervousness, headaches, insomnia, nightmares, and confused thought processes.“Sometimes I feel overwhelmed. I get trepidations, nervous, agitated, I go off the deep end…Here I feel like I’m in a kennel, closed off from life itself. I feel like I live in a coffin, like a tomb” - An Individual From Northern CaliforniaThe U.S. Supreme Court has held solitary confinement in direct violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The United Nations has said prolonged solitary more than 15 days should be prohibited.“The effects of the Supermax reach beyond the confines of its walls and fences…”Even if they have no prior history of mental illness, prisoners subjected to prolonged isolation may experience depression, despair, anxiety, rage, claustrophobia, hallucinations, problems with impulse control, and/or an impaired ability to think, concentrate, or remember.“When I was finally released from the Supermax into general population after almost two years, it was overwhelming.
