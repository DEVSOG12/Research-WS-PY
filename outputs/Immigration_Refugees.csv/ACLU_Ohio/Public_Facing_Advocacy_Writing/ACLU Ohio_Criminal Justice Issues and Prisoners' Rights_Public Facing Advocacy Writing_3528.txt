On March 10, the organization wrote to Governor DeWine requesting an immediate plan of action to manage the spread of the virus in Ohio’s prisons, youth facilities, and jails; and just yesterday, an email hotline (covid19@acluohio.org) was created to serve Ohio’s incarcerated population and their loved ones“The urgency of deliberate and thoughtful action cannot be overstated. Lives are on the line and we are eager to work with the state to ensure the implementation of policies that will limit the threats presented by this public health crisis,” concluded Gary Daniels, Chief Lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio.“During this critical time, it is imperative that no one avoids seeking medical treatment because they fear immigration enforcement, or else, the impact and spread of COVID-19 could drastically worsen across Ohio. Additionally, there are far too many individuals locked up in Ohio’s prisons and jails who would be better served in their communities. Let’s not forget, on any given day there are more than 20,000 people in Ohio jails –two-thirds of whom are legally innocent,” added Jocelyn Rosnick, Policy Director for the ACLU of Ohio.The letter to ICE and the open letter to criminal justice stakeholders are available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdfLetter To Governor DeWine - COVID-19 and DRCpdfLtr_ACLUOhio_COVID-19_ICE_03182020.pdfpdfLetter_OhioGovernmentElectedOfficialsCriminalJusticeStakeholders_2020-0318.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
