In the face of staggering unemployment numbers and climbing medical costs, millions of people living in the United States—and over 3.5 million renters living in Ohio—face the imminent threat of losing their homes or access to utility service The ACLU is calling for the prevention of mass evictions in the midst of this global COVID-19 public health crisis.“With the first of the month rapidly approaching, it is critical that Governor DeWine act quickly to protect vulnerable Ohio residents against eviction and utility shut-offs,” said Jocelyn Rosnick, Policy Director at the ACLU of Ohio. “All residents — regardless of their circumstances or background — should have access to safe and stable housing throughout the course of this ongoing public health crisis.”"Throughout Ohio, families are still being evicted and forced into overcrowded shelters where physical distancing is impossible. Shelters have always been an inappropriate response from families but during COVID-19 they are downright dangerous. Keeping people in their housing through a comprehensive eviction moratorium is the best homeless prevention policy that Governor DeWine can implement," added Chris Knestrick, Executive Director for the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless."Governor DeWine must take this important step to protect Ohio families who have been hit hardest COVID-19 and ensure they are able to safely remain in their homes," added Carrie Pleasants, Executive Director for the Fair Housing Center for Rights and Research.The organizations call on Governor DeWine to issue a comprehensive moratorium that will:Halt every stage of the eviction process;Continue to prevent mass evictions during and after the pandemic;Apply to all types of tenants and lease violations;Prohibit the collection of late fees and retaliation against tenants who assert their rights under the moratorium;Prohibit utility shut-offs and require restoration of previously disconnected services.The ACLU has worked over the years to address unfair eviction screening policies, which disproportionately undermine housing opportunities for women of color and will present a barrier to safe housing opportunities if mass evictions take place.Read the letter.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeDrug PolicyDocumentspdfFINAL_HousingCoalition_EvictionMoratoria_04302020.pdfRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
