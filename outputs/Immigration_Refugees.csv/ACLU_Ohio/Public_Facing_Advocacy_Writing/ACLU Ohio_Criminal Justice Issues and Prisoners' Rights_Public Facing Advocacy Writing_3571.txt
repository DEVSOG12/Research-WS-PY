The three-judge panel has said that collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures during a global pandemic was within the capacity of the campaign, but we know, other courts across the country know, and our diverse coalition of supporters knows that to embark on traditional signature collection during this time would have been dangerous, unethical, immoral, and absurd. Given the rapid pace of the litigation, we continue to consider our path forward and evaluate our next steps. Our commitment has always been to voters. The state’s drastic move to stop our campaign from moving forward reveal their true priorities when it comes to the rights of Ohio voters. The response from Ohio officials underscores why people, not politicians, should decide how to update Ohio’s election laws.”The order is available.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesVoting RightsDocumentspdf2020-05-26-0360-Order-granting-stay.pdfRelated contentOur rights are on the ballot.
