The reforms proposed today would require that forfeitures must be processed through criminal proceedings and correctly places the burden of proof on the state, restoring due process and protecting the rights of innocent property owners.“Given the fundamental unfairness that already typifies our criminal justice system, it should be no surprise that the people who suffer the most under current laws are people of color and low-income Ohioans. Failed policies like the War on Drugs devastate communities of color through outdated laws and targeted policing. Civil asset forfeiture has also been a tool to perpetuate injustice on these same people.”Brickner also noted that the proposed legislation will place limits on sharing of seized assets between state and federal agencies. “This reform will also help to rein in Ohio’s overuse of federal equitable sharing laws that allow local law enforcement agencies to seize assets for their own profit. While federal legislative reform is still needed, this limitation will help to ensure that these laws are not used to prey on lower-income Ohioans with smaller assets.”The ACLU of Ohio supports this new legislation as part of Fix Forfeiture, a coalition of conservative and progressive groups dedicated to passing sweeping civil asset forfeiture reforms.###Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesSmart JusticeRelated contentACLU of Ohio Launches Billboard Advertisements in Lima Advocating...September 21, 2022Vote No on Issue 1 (2022) - Talking PointsSeptember 15, 2022ACLU of Ohio Opposes Ballot Issue 1, Misguided Initiative to...September 8, 2022Cincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022Ten Ohio Organizations Urge Changes To Plans For Felony Sentencing...June 28, 2022On the Basis of Punishment: Women in Ohio PrisonsJune 14, 2022Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
