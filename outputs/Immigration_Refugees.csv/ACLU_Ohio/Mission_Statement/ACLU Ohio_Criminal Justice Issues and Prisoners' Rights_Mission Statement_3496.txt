Founded in 1920, the national ACLU includes more than 500,000 members in all 50 states, making it our country's foremost advocate of individual rights.The ACLU of Ohio has nearly 30,000 members and supporters statewide.We are supported by annual dues and contributions from supporters, as well as grants from private foundations. We do not receive any government funding.Through education, litigation, and lobbying the ACLU seeks to preserve civil liberties for each new generation.Because the ACLU has a limited budget and staff, it is impossible to represent every person whose civil liberties have been violated. Instead, the organization tries to select cases which will impact the greatest number of people -- those cases which have the potential to break new ground or establish new precedents to strengthen our freedoms.Mission StatementTo champion and expand constitutional and other fundamental rights and to pursue racial, economic, gender, and social equity for all Ohioans using all the tools of integrated advocacy without political partisanship; to fight in both principle and practice for the best ideals of fairness, freedom, and justice; and to advance our mission through an anti-racist, intersectional lens with determination, agility, practicality, and hope.ResourcesUnion/Foundation: What is the Difference?Active Civil Liberties Leaders in OhioIn Memory: Tributes to Past Civil Liberties LeadersAdditional resources below:Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usDocumentspdfAudited Financial Statements 2021-2022pdfIRS 990, ACLU of Ohio Foundation 501(c)(3), 2020-2021pdfIRS 990, ACLU of Ohio 501(c)(4), 2020-2021pdfBylaws (updated July 2022)pdfConflict of Interest PolicypdfDonor ConfidentialitypdfDonor Bill Of RightspdfFundraising EthicspdfGift Acceptance PolicypdfACLU of Ohio - Strategic Plan (2021-2024)Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
