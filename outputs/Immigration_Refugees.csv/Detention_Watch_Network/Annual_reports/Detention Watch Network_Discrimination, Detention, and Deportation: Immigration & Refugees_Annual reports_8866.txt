All Rights Reserved.Introduction
The United States government manages the largest immigration detention sys tem in the world.  Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland Secur ity (DHS), oversees the 
detention of hundreds of thousands of individuals charged with civil immig ration violations each year in a 
sprawling network of over 200 immigration jails across the U.S. In 2009, Cong ress began including a 
requirement to fund a minimum number of beds (currently 34,000) dedicated t o detention at any given time 
in its annual appropriations bill. Since the policy, often referred to as the  national detention bed quota, went 
into effect, the number of people detained each year has increased from 3 83,524 in FY (fiscal year) 2009 to 
a record breaking 477,000 in FY 2012.1  
In the last decade the detention system has grown by 75 
percent,2 an expansion that depends heavily on ICE’s 
increasing use of private contractors to operate and 
provide services at immigration jails across the country. 
Sixty-two percent of immigration detention beds are 
operated by private prison companies,3  such as 
Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and the Geo 
Group (GEO). Many government-owned facilities also rely 
on privately contracted detention-related services such 
as food, security, and transportation. This 
interdependent relationship with private industry has 
produced a set of government-sanctioned detention 
quotas that ensure profits for the companies involved 
while incentivizing the incarceration of immigrants. 
Accordingly, a large portion of the over $2 billion in the 
FY 2016 budget4  for detention operations will ultimately 
go to for-profit contractors.  
ICE’s contracts with private detention companies have exacerbated t he effects of the federal detention bed 
quota by imposing local “lockup” quotas, contractual provisions that o bligate ICE to pay for a minimum 
number of immigration detention beds at specific facilities, referre d to in contracts as “guaranteed 
minimums.” Because guaranteed minimums require payment to private contrac tors whether beds are filled 
or not, ICE faces considerable pressure to fill them.  Local lockup quotas  that serve to protect the bottom line 
of private companies thus incentivize the imprisonment of immigrants. 
This report aims to expose the use of guaranteed minimums at the local level a nd its potential influence over 
ICE’s detention practices. Although this report offers the most comprehe nsive information to date on the use 
of guaranteed minimums, the information presented herein provides only a part ial picture of the use of these 
local lockup quotas across the U.S. due to ICE’s reticence regarding the d etails of their detention facility 
contracts. The report draws on data obtained from a current Freedom  of Information Act (FOIA) request filed 
by Detention Watch Network and the Center for Constitutional Rights5 in November 2013.  Information has 
also been gathered from solicitations listed and archived at the Federa l Business Opportunities website, 
where the government posts requests for business proposals.6  Additionally, where possible, contracts from 
the National Immigrant Justice Center’s ICE FOIA request7 were also reviewed and utilized.

Center contract with the GEO Group.- 2 -National Detention Bed Quota
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required ICE  to increase, in each fiscal year 
from 2006 to 2010, the number of immigration detention beds available by 8,0 00 above the preceding fiscal 
year’s number.8  Beyond a requirement to create additional capacity, ICE was also under  pressure to use it. In 
February 2006, then Assistant Secretary of ICE Julie Myers Wood met wit h then Chairman of the House 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security Harold Rogers (R-KY) and Representat ives Louis Gohmert (R-TX), John 
Culberson (R-TX), and Judge John Carter (R-TX).9  In that meeting, Representatives Culberson and Carter 
highlighted that “[d]etention facilities in Laredo are only one-third full,” a nd that there are “[h]undreds of 
empty beds.” Chairman Rogers noted that as one of his “key issues,” he wante d “‘no’ empty beds.”10  
 
The use of arbitrary numerical 
goals escalated in 2009 when 
Congress began formally 
including the national bed quota 
in annual appropriations bills.  
Since then, the detention bed 
quota has been written into the 
DHS Appropriations Act, which 
states, “… funding made 
available under this heading 
shall maintain a level of not less 
than 34,000 detention beds.”11  
In addition to requiring that ICE 
maintain the physical capacity to 
detain at least 34,000 people at 
any time, many members of 
Congress have urged ICE to 
interpret this language to require 
that all detention beds be in use 
at all times—that is, that a minimum of 34,000 beds not only be funded, but also fille d, every day. Over time, 
congressional frustration over empty beds has grown. In April 2015, after  a heated exchange with ICE Director 
Sarah Saldaña, Representative John Culberson (R-TX) suggested that the c urrent quota language be altered 
to replace the word “maintain” with “fill.”12  Congressional staff have also repeatedly, if incorrectly,13  told ICE 
that keeping an average of at least 34,000 detained per day is a statut ory requirement.14  
These criticisms make clear that ICE faces substantial pressure to fu nnel immigrants into detention in order 
to keep beds filled, despite the arbitrariness of quotas at both the na tional and local levels. Former ICE 
Director John Sandweg expressed this frustration in a September 201 3 interview with Bloomberg , saying that 
“[h]aving a mandate out there that says you have to detain a certain number –  regardless of how many folks 
are a public safety threat or threaten the integrity of the system – doesn’t s eem to make a lot of sense. You 
need the numbers to drive the detention needs, not set an arbitrary number tha t then drives your 
operation.”15  No other law enforcement agency is subject to a national quota system for inca rceration. 
Prominent law enforcement officials have decried the national quota as “un precedented” with a “corrupting 
influence on the entire process” of enforcement and removal.16

No other law enforcement agency is subject to 
a  national quota system for incarceration.”“While members of Congress continue to stress the importance of “filling” t he mandated 34,000 immigration 
detention beds, local lockup quotas for immigrants in the form of guarante ed minimums also place pressure 
on ICE to fill beds. Guaranteed minimums are contractual provisions that obli gate ICE to pay for a minimum 
number of immigration detention beds at specific facilities. Because  guaranteed minimums require payment 
to private contractors whether beds are filled or not, they function as lo cal lockup quotas, incentivizing ICE to 
fill detention beds because of the contract stipulation. Present exclu sively in contracts with private 
companies, the growth of local lockup quotas is inextricably linked to the r ise of corporate interests in 
immigration detention.  
A. Guaranteeing Proﬁt for Private Companies
Guaranteed minimums predate the national quota’s inception and have existed  at least since 2003. Their 
use can be understood in the context of the private prison industry’s pas t instability and its successful 
pursuit of guaranteed profit. 
In 1984, CCA built the first private prison in 
the U.S., the Houston Processing Center, an 
immigration detention center in Houston, 
TX. Although the private prison system has 
grown considerably since then, in the late 
1990s, the industry lost steam as CCA 
almost went bankrupt and the stock of 
Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (now 
GEO) fell significantly.17  After being bailed 
out by the now-defunct hedge fund Lehman 
Brothers, the private prison industry saw 
the government’s post-9/11 interest in 
expanding immigration detention as a 
potential cash cow and began vying for 
more federal contracts to incarcerate 
immigrants.18  
Revitalized after the period of crisis, the 
private prison industry moved to secure its 
future by pursuing the incorporation of guaranteed minimums into contrac ts.   CCA’s 2003 contract for the 
Houston Processing Center was one of the first to include a guaranteed  minimum, this one for 375 
persons.19   Since then, an increasing number of contracts between ICE and private contra ctors for detention 
or detention-related services have included guaranteed minimums. These g uarantees act as 
taxpayer-funded insurance for private companies against any changes  in immigration enforcement policy or 
prioritization, because the companies are paid regardless of how ma ny individuals ICE detains. Guaranteed 
minimums have now spread to every type of immigration detention facility.

Elizabeth: 285ICEʼs Enforcement and Removal Office (ERO), which oversee s detention operations,
is divided into 24 field officesi nationwide. Of those, 1 2 have guaranteed minimums.iiICE categorizes its detention facilities into three primary categor ies: Service Processing Centers, which are 
owned and administered by ICE; Contract Detention Facilities, in which ICE cont racts directly with a private 
company; and Intergovernmental Service Agreements (IGSAs), through which ICE r ents out space in local or 
state facilities. In reality, however, the arrangements are more complica ted, and these categories can 
obscure the involvement of private companies even at public facilit ies. Service Processing Centers, those 
facilities owned and operated by ICE, do sometimes contract out for det ention-related services such as 
security, transportation, and food. Similarly, many local governments sign the IG SA with ICE and then 
sub-contract with private companies to operate the detention cente r or to provide detention-related services. 
Although guaranteed minimums are found formally only in contracts with private co mpanies, sub-contracting 
within IGSAs and SPCs means that private companies can be involved and mini mums can occur in all three 
types of contract categories including public facilities, as outlined  in the chart below. When the contractor 
operates the entire facility, whether contracted or sub-contracted, t hey receive the per-bed payment as if the 
guaranteed population was detained. This functions in the same way for pr ivate contractors providing other 
services. For example, in a food service contract with a guaranteed mi nimum, the contractor will be paid as if 
they provided food for the guaranteed population, even if the number of pe ople actually detained was lower.

Contracts with guaranteed minimums are understood at the field office le vel as general priorities within their 
relevant geographic area, and create incentives for heightened enforce ment in order to fill beds. This 
pressure to fill beds and fulfill the mandate is felt acutely at local field of fices where facilities with 
guaranteed minimums are prioritized and privately-contracted beds a nd services are perceived as being 
more “cost efficient.” 
Crucial to the cost-efficiency calculus is the use of “tiered pricing,”  in which ICE receives a discount on each 
person detained above the guaranteed minimum.  Tiered pricing creates d irect financial incentives for ICE 
not only to meet the guaranteed minimum, but also to fill guaranteed-minimum facilit ies to capacity in order 
to take advantage of discounts for additional immigrants.
When ICE fails to make the most of its financial arrangements with private com panies, it risks critique. In 
October 2014, for example, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO ) produced a report on 
immigration detention criticizing ICE for underutilizing cost-effici ent bed space.20  Per the contracts, ICE paid 
certain facilities their guaranteed minimums even when the beds went unoccu pied. The GAO further 
censured ICE for failing to capitalize on the tiered pricing model and r ecommended that ICE develop “an 
oversight mechanism to ensure that field offices comply with guidance to p lace detainees, whenever 
possible, in facilities with guaranteed minimums and tiered pricing [to]  provide ICE with better assurance 
that it is cost-effectively managing detainee placement.”21   
ICE officials pass this message from headquarters to the field offic e level. According to the same GAO report, 
if “ICE ERO headquarters officials…notice that a particular area o f responsibility [field office] has open space 
in facilities with guaranteed minimums, they can call the field office directo r to find out why the guaranteed 
minimum is not being met.”22 
 
Indeed, during the 2013 budget sequestration in which ICE released 2,226  immigrants23  from detention due 
to budget cuts, ERO Assistant Director for Operations Support, Wi lliam C. Randolph, and then Acting 
Assistant Director for Field Operations, Philip T. Miller, advised local o ffices in an email that “[t]he first 
priorities for funding are the 11iii  [field offices] that have detention facilities with guaranteed minimum 
beds.”24  In another email, Miller emphasized again that field offices should “[e]nsure  that all mandatory 
minimum detention bed guarantees are being met and that any net cost benefits  of tiered pricing or low cost 
beds are being realized.”25 
Repeating this directive from headquarters, Washington Field Offic e Director Mary Evans wrote, “Ensure that 
all mandatory minimum detention bed guarantees are being met and that any net cost  benefits of tiered 
pricing or low costs beds are being realized. For our purposes that me ans that Farmville [Detention Center] 
should stay at a population of 505 or above.”26  
Because GEO Group has been the most successful company in getting guarant eed minimums incorporated 
into their contracts, their facilities are often prioritized in ord er to fill local quotas. Denver’s then Field Office 
Director John P. Longshore wrote an email in 2013 saying, “we must ensure we ar e maximizing GEO beds for 
cost savings—I believe that our usage has improved again. We will be get ting emails and calls from HQ [ICE 
headquarters] if they note we are not making good use of those cheaper be ds. They already call me enough 
on stuff.”46  Longshore also mentions an interest in raising “GEO usage” to “the full contra ct amount of 
525.”47 
- 6 -  iii  11 field offices are listed in a January 2013 ICE spreadsheet, but DWN and  CCR’s FOIA request revealed that the New Orleans Field Office also has a 
guaranteed minimum at the Jena/LaSalle Detention Facility. See footnote ii. - 7-A marked preference for GEO beds is also seen in the Miami field office whe re then Deputy Assistant Director 
of Field Operations Jack Bennett wrote to the local field office that, “[ g]iven the fact that the beds beyond 
your minimum at Broward are $6.24 each, please fill them up to your max. Field op s will make the necessary 
adjustments to your ADP [average daily population].”48  Internal communications also indicate that GEO has 
placed pressure on ICE field offices to increase bed usage. An employe e at the Northwest Detention Center 
wrote in an email that, “our AFOD [Assistant Field Office Director] over  the [sic] NWDC has reported that the 
Warden/Administrator of the NWDC has stated that ‘he wouldn’t be surprise d, if we go down to 500 
detainees, that GEO might not give ICE 60 days notice’, [sic] meaning to cancel the contract.”49 
The financial incentives and bureaucratic pressures associated wi th the local lockup quotas are particularly 
worrying when combined with easily manipulated enforcement, detention and relea se practices. Through 
mechanisms like these, financial considerations and private profit can aff ect government decisions to 
deprive immigrants of liberty at a concrete, local level.
Ultimately, ICE has significant control over the pipeline of immigrants entering  and leaving detention. ICE 
controls the pace and aggressiveness of its enforcement operations, a nd the field offices that determine 
when and how to conduct enforcement operations are the recipients of dire ct pressure to fill beds. Within 
this system, a single guaranteed minimum risks influencing decisions in an entire f ield office jurisdiction.51   
In addition to controlling the number of people coming into detention, ICE contro ls the release of individuals 
from detention through the manipulation of bond and parole decisions. A rece nt example of ICE’s power to 
keep people detained was their virtual “no bond” or “high bond” policy rela ting to asylum-seeking Central 
American families, in which mothers and children who had passed an initial eligibi lity screening for the 
asylum process—after which they would previously have been released—wer e instead detained for long 
periods of time.52  Although this change in practice was driven by a desire to deter future a sylum-seekers 
from migrating to the U.S., it demonstrates how vulnerable bond and parole de cisions are to manipulation in 
order to ensure guaranteed bed minimums are met.

  v Karnes was converted into a family detention facility on August 1, 2014. It i s still operated by the GEO Group, but it is unclear whether there is a 
guaranteed minimum. We currently have no direct evidence of a family quota. * Italicized numbers are from solicitations- 9 -Stealth Contracting
The outsourcing of detention promotes a lack of transparency regarding c ontracts and relationships between 
localities and the federal government. While ICE publishes select IGSA contrac ts on its website, agreements 
for detention space and detention-related services with private cont ractors are considerably more obscure 
—whether ICE contracts with the company directly, or the company is sub-c ontracted by a local government. 
In response to FOIA requests, ICE redacts crucial details, including pric ing information, of contracts or 
sub-contracts with private companies by claiming the information is exe mpt from disclosure because it may 
constitute “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obt ained from a person and privileged or 
confidential.”53  The Freedom of Information Act further permits ICE to engage in a lengthy proc ess to seek 
permission from the companies themselves to release such information to the  public.54  Thus, even when ICE 
has released detention facility contracts, information regarding guara nteed minimums is almost always 
redacted. 
The absence of transparency about what exactly is promised and gained in de tention facility contracts is 
further obscured by the way in which these contracts are quietly renewed, o ften on an annual schedule, 
sometimes with higher negotiated guaranteed minimums. For example, the Hous ton Processing Center’s 
guaranteed minimum increased from 37555  to 75056  between 2003 and 2008, and at Port Isabel Detention 
Center, the guaranteed minimum increased from 50057  to 80058  between 2008 and 2014. Krome 
Detention Center’s guaranteed minimum also saw an increase from 250 to 450 b etween 2008 and 2014.59  
For each of these, there is no publicly available information as to why such dra matic increases were 
necessary.
Guaranteed minimums are far from the only source of pressure at the local level. W hen ICE has been forced 
by budget cuts to detain fewer immigrants, state and county jails have exer ted political pressure to combat 
the decreases and push for a return to capacity. 
Like private contractors, local and state government actors also exer t pressure to fill local beds in order to 
access federal funds. In anticipation of budget cuts due to the seques tration of funding in early 2013, ICE 
attempted to lower the number of individuals held in immigration detentio n facilities. ERO headquarters 
warned the field offices to expect questions or pushback from local “c ontract partners.” The New York field 
office anticipated hearing from concerned wardens,60  while the Atlanta Assistant Field Office Director wrote 
in an email that “[i]f the management of NGDC [North Georgia Detention Center], ACDC  [Atlanta Contract 
Detention Center], or ICDC [Irwin Contract Detention Center] wish to voice the ir population concerns (or any 
other concerns), you are welcome to refer them to me.”61  
Representatives from Chicago and Sacramento jails sent emails to their r espective field offices in 2013 
inquiring as to when detention numbers would increase again.62  And an individual from the Frederick County 
Jail in Maryland requested that the period of performance on its contra ct be extended “as far as the 
remaining funding will go[.]”63  A captain from Boone County Jail in Illinois wrote in a February 2013 email 
that, “[t]he jailer and I were just curious if you knew anymore [sic] than we di d about this situation and if we 
should look at trying to refill these beds with state inmates or if there is an y hope that our numbers will 
increase.”  
Beyond the pressure to fill beds, some extremely sub-par facilities have  also stayed open to retain jobs in 
counties that are dependent on federal contracts to pad low and often dwi ndling budgets. Etowah County 
Detention Center, which has been singled out as one of the worst detention cent ers in the country for its 
abysmal conditions64  was slated to close in 2010. Local Dependence on Detention Dollars- 10 -Representative Robert Aderholt (R-AL) 
and other members of Congress from 
Alabama immediately acted to 
countermand ICE’s plan to close the 
facility because of the potential loss of 
jobs in the county. Senator Richard 
Shelby (R-AL), who sits on the DHS 
Appropriations Committee, threatened 
ICE’s funding if it moved forward with 
terminating Etowah’s contract, after 
which ICE rescinded its decision and 
cancelled plans to close the facility.65  
Despite ICE’s efforts to end the contract 
due to the facility’s remote location and 
lack of immigrants’ access to counsel, 
Etowah continues to detain immigrants 
today.
Recommendations
There is a growing consensus that the mass detention of immigrants is unneces sary and inhumane. The 
U.S. government should move towards ending the use of immigration detention a ltogether. Unfortunately, 
corporate interests and the absence of job growth have converted the d etention of human beings into a 
market-based activity. However, detention capacity and infrastruct ure must not be a determining factor in 
immigration enforcement and deportation policy. As immediate next steps, t his report calls on:
ICE to remove guaranteed minimums, tiered pricing or any oth er provisions that could 
function as a local lockup quota, from all detention contra cts. 
ICE to make all information pertaining to detention contrac ts and the bidding process 
publicly accessible and transparent. 
ICE to stop contracting with private companies that lobb y to pervert public policy via 
guaranteed minimums and other contractual giveaways.
ICE to bar (1) the transfer of individuals between detent ion facilities; (2) the manipulation of 
bond or parole determinations; and (3) the initiation of enf orcement actions based in whole 
or in part on empty detention beds, unmet guaranteed min imums, or tiered pricing. 
Congress to remove the national detention bed quota fro m the FY 2016 DHS Appropriations 
bill.
Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Alabama- 11 -By requiring ICE to fill a certain number of detention beds on a daily basis at  specific facilities, the U.S. 
government is allowing private interests a hand in setting policy on immigra tion enforcement and 
detention, while at the same time padding their bottom line. As long as the guara nteed minimums are in 
place, especially if they are reinforced by a national detention bed quota, the  profits and the business 
model of these facilities are protected from the potential effects of  immigration reform legislation, any 
expansion of prosecutorial discretion, or other administrative act ions. 
Even more disconcerting is the way in which local lockup quotas and the nationa l immigration detention 
quota may influence ICE’s decision-making. More research is needed to determi ne the extent to which 
these quotas have prompted ICE to more vigorously collaborate with loca l law enforcement solely for the 
purpose of finding additional people to detain, as well as how decisions a bout transfers between facilities 
are made and whether or not meaningful access to bond and parole are affec ted at facilities with 
guaranteed minimums.
The private sector should not be rewarded for placing a price tag on the  deprivation of liberty, and the 
government should be held accountable for being a willful participant in this c orrupted system. The practice 
of immigration detention, once rarely used, has become a rigid part of the U nited States’ immigration and 
budget policy. Before any real immigration reform can be realized, the nat ional and local lockup quotas 
have to be addressed. As a first step towards the ultimate closure of  all detention facilities, ICE should end 
the use of guaranteed minimums and tiered pricing, and Congress should elimina te the national detention 
bed quota. Conclusion- 12 -APPENDIX: Contracts’ Periods of Performance

10. During his tenure as the head of a committee with power over DHS’s budget , Chairman Rogers was found to have funneled large

13. The appropriations bill language speaks only to the funding of 34,000 bed s. Further, under Article II of the Constitution, the 
executive branch is given “significant prosecutorial discretion no t to take enforcement action against violators of a federal law.” See In 
re Aiken Cnty ., 725 F.3d 255, 262-63 (D.C. Cir. 2013). For this reason, Congress “may not mandate  that the President prosecute a 
certain type of offense or offender,” and therefore cannot require that  the executive branch hold a certain number of people in 
immigration detention.

51. As a potential consequence, immigration enforcement in regions with guar anteed minimums may be affected by the requirement to 
fill a local bed quota. For example, the San Diego Field Office has two detent ion facilities, but only the Otay Mesa Detention Center has a 
guaranteed minimum. Enforcement actions anywhere in the jurisdiction of that  Field Office could be wholly, or in part, motivated by the 
need to meet Otay Mesa’s guaranteed minimum.
