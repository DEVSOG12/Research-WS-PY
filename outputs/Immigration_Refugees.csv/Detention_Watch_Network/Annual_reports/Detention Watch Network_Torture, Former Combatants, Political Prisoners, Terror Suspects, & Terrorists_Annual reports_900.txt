REPORT
2019ANNUAL
Photo by Fernando LopezFront page photo by Faylita HicksDEAR FRIENDS,
Last year marked my 10-year anniversary on staff at Detention Watch 
Network (DWN). Looking back, the past decade has seen an unprecedented 
level of immigration enforcement: from the Obama administration’s 
mass deportation machine to the current administration that has been 
dehumanizing and menacing immigrant communities since day one. At the 
same time, our movement has risen to the challenge, utilizing innovative 
tactics and strategies, fostering new partnerships, and shifting from a 
focus on detention conditions to an abolitionist mission seeking to end 
the inhumane practice of immigration detention altogether. I couldn’t 
be prouder to be here now as we continue to build power towards our 
collective liberation.
In addition to my personal milestone, 2019 was a pivotal year for Detention Watch Network. As we 
continued facing attempts to expand immigration detention and criminalize immigrant communities, our 
resolve to resist and build the capacity of our Network is stronger than ever. I’m proud to share that we 
made significant strides and advanced our mission of abolishing immigration detention in this country. 
These victories are outlined in greater detail in this report.
DWN held several powerful member gatherings throughout the year – a cohort of members with 
experience in detention came together for a Healing Towards Liberation convening in Chicago, IL 
in the summer; we hosted our first  Communities not Cages convening  with over 80 participants in 
Birmingham, AL for strategizing, skill-sharing, and community building; and we brought our members 
together for a Spokesperson Training in Los Angeles, CA . Additionally, the Network continues to grow, 
with 209 members (108 organizational and 101 individual) based in 32 states and participation in the 
Defund Hate and Communities not Cages campaigns constantly expanding.
It’s no secret that attacks against immigrant communities are relentless under this administration, which 
is why we decided to increase our organizational capacity by hiring several new positions throughout 
the year. In 2019, our team grew from eight to 14 staff – increasing our ability to carry out advocacy, 
organizing, communications, and operations work. We also maintained our commitment to investing in 
the wellbeing of our staff through launching a wellness fund and holding a team-building retreat in May 
2019.
Organizationally, DWN went through a significant shift in 2019 as we worked to launch as an independent 
501(c)3 organization, following many years as a fiscally sponsored project of the Tides Center. We 
successfully received our 501(c)3 determination from the IRS in August and “spun off” from Tides on 
December 31, 2019, beginning operations as our own nonprofit on January 1, 2020.   
Looking ahead, I’m eager to advance our mission and build collective power at the local, state, and 
national levels. Although the path to dismantling the ruthless immigration detention system is a difficult 
and long-term challenge, I am honored and grateful to lead a passionate team and a dedicated Network 
towards a future where immigrants are not criminalized, and racial equity is the norm. Lastly, I want to 
thank you all for everything we have been able to accomplish together and for your continued support.
IN  SOLIDARITY,

3GROWTH & 
RETENTIONDWN is a proudly member-driven Network, and our strength comes 
from our diverse and committed membership. Throughout 2019, 
DWN grew and diversified its membership, including bringing in 
individuals directly affected by immigration incarceration and groups 
from key geographies where immigration detention has been 
increasing. In total, the Network onboarded 56 new members — 
23 organizations and 33 individuals with seven individuals directly 
affected by immigration detention. 
HEALING 
TOWARDS 
LIBERATION 
COHORTDWN hopes to encourage and model the principle of developing 
the leadership of people most impacted by detention to be at the 
core of the fight against immigration incarceration. To this end, 
DWN developed a cohort of members with direct experience in 
detention, called Healing Towards Liberation . The group first 
convened in Chicago in July 2019 with over 20 participants. The 
participants engaged in healing, skill-shares, art workshops, and 
strategy conversations. The convening was successful, providing 
a space for this cohort to get to know each other, process their 
experience and heal together, and begin thinking of the next steps 
for a leadership cohort for people who have lived through detention. 
To date, the cohort maintains active communication through regular 
calls to discuss leadership development, goals, and activities that will 
provide guidance to the Network’s approach in ending immigration 
detention. 
4ORGANIZING 
SUPPORT
PROGRAMDWN is committed to capacity-building and providing 
support and resources to our members. In 2019, the Network 
completed its fourth round of a sub-granting program – the 
Organizing Support Program (OSP). Through OSP, DWN 
provides small grants to DWN members to support projects 
with innovative approaches to closing detention centers or 
supporting people who are detained in local facilities. DWN 
granted a total of $152,000 to 12 grassroots organizational 
members.

5DEFUND HATE
The Defund Hate  campaign, co-
led by DWN, continued its efforts 
to reduce the funding allocated 
for Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) and Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) in 
2019. 
The campaign ended the year  
having effectively blocked  
$7 billion in funding for 
immigration enforcement 
operations since its 2017 launch. 
The diverse and growing coalition 
also succeeded in getting over 
100 members of Congress 
(MOCs) on the record calling for 
cuts in funds to ICE and CBP, 
with “Defund Hate” becoming 
a primary demand for the 
progressive movement. 
Throughout 2019, the Defund 
Hate coalition engaged in two 
fiscal year campaigns: Fiscal Year 
2019 (FY19) with a budget deal 
struck in March, and Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), with negotiations 
concluding in December.
Fiscal Year 2019
The year started with the 
government in the midst of an 
unprecedented 35-day partial 
shutdown. The government 
reopened on January 25, with a 
Continuing Resolution through 
February 15 and formation of a 
bipartisan, bicameral Conference 
Committee dedicated to 
negotiating a deal. During 
this process, the Defund Hate 
campaign engaged in efforts 
to prevent increased funding 
for detention and deportation 
operations for FY19 through 
delivery of over 330,000 petition 
signatures to congressional 
leadership, email blasts to over 
100 Hill offices, targeted outreach 
with conference conferees and 
congressional caucuses, aligned 
messaging, and relationship 
building. However, despite the coalition’s 
best efforts, the final negotiated 
bill did not meet these demands, 
with no limitation on transfers 
and a 5,000 person per day 
increase in detention funding. 
Throughout the shutdown and 
conference committee process, 
there was more attention paid to 
detention than ever before, and 
detention capacity became a final 
sticking point in the negotiations. 
In June, DWN and United We 
Dream (UWD) organized a two-
day Defund Hate convening. 
Approximately 100 people 
participated in strategy sessions, 
an action in the Senate rotunda, 
and Hill visits.
 
Fiscal Year 2020
In early 2019, coalition members 
also began holding meetings with 
MOCs to position them for the 
FY20 fight. The coalition met with Photo by Javier Sierra
6DEFUND HATE CAMPAIGN PARTNERS
first term MOCs to educate them 
about Defund Hate priorities, as 
well as MOCs who voted for the 
FY19 spending bill to hold them 
accountable and persuade them 
to support cuts in funding for 
FY20.
In addition to educating 
MOCs about the FY20 federal 
budgeting process, the coalition 
responded to a supplemental 
funding request by the Trump 
administration for $4.5 billion 
in additional enforcement 
funding in April. Unfortunately, 
getting support for rejecting 
the supplemental request 
was difficult. The Trump 
administration attached border 
funds to disaster relief funding 
and treated the supplemental 
requests as a necessary response 
to the (completely manufactured) 
humanitarian crisis at the border. 
In response, the coalition sent 
out action alerts, coordinated 
an organizational sign-on letter, 
drafted talking points and 
social media graphics, met with 
congressional offices in both the 
House and Senate, and held a 
national call-in day against the 
supplemental funding request. 
After weeks of work to oppose 
this funding request, Congress 
passed the supplemental 
funding bill in June. The final 
package included some positive 
things like reimbursement for 
communities at the border, 
funding for case management, 
post-release services, child 
advocates and legal services for 
unaccompanied children, and 
increasing funding for the Legal 
Orientation Program (LOP). 
However, it mostly funded more 
enforcement and detention.
As the end of the fiscal year 
neared, the coalition held a Defund Hate congressional 
briefing in late July, attended by 
30 House staffers. In addition, 
the coalition coalesced around 
an August recess strategy and a 
revised set of demands. 
In the end, following two 
Continuing Resolutions, the FY20 
bill was passed in late December. 
The bill resulted in positive gains 
as 1) 75 members of Congress in 
the House voted no on the FY20 
appropriations package because 
it failed to include Defund Hate 
priorities, 2) the passed bill prohibits ICE from stopping 
MOCs from doing unannounced 
visits, and 3) 2020 is the first 
year since Trump took office that 
Congress did not appropriate an 
increase in detention capacity. 
However, the final bill still 
allows ICE and CBP to continue 
expanding the detention and 
deportation force and to take 
money from other agencies 
within Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS). Unfortunately, 
the bill also provides DHS $1.37 
billion to build the border wall.

7DWN launched its Communities 
not Cages (CNC) campaign 
in 2018, which amplifies the 
longstanding local organizing 
of members, advocates, and 
allies across the country against 
detention centers. In 2019, the 
campaign continued building a 
nationally coordinated strategy 
focused on preventing detention 
expansion through three 
different types of work: anti-
expansion, shut down efforts, 
and stopping the proliferation 
of ICE detention into other 
government agencies.
In 2019, the CNC campaign 
prevented five more detention 
facilities from opening or 
expanding: in Dwight, IL; Ionia 
County, MI; Sherburne County, 
MN; and New Richmond, WI. 
The campaign also supported 
the passage of HB 2040 in IL in 
April 2019, which bans for-profit 
immigration detention centers, 
and Assembly Bill 32 in CA in October 2019 which bans private 
prisons used by Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE).
DWN held its inaugural CNC 
convening in November 2019 
in Birmingham, AL, bringing 
together over 80 organizers, 
advocates, and people who 
are directly impacted by the detention system for skill-
sharing, community-building, 
and strategizing for 2020. DWN 
staff, members, and partners 
hosted workshops on various 
advocacy, communications, and 
organizing strategies during the 
first two days. Moreover, the 
convening included plenaries and This 2019, the Communities not Cages campaign successfully prevented 
five more detention facilities from opening or expanding and supported the 
passage of HB 2040 in Illinois in April and Assembly Bill 32 in CA in October, 
which bans for-profit immigration detention centers.

STRATEGIC 
RESEARCH SPOKESPERSON 
TRAINING
In fall 2018, DWN entered a partnership with the reputable firm 
Goodwin Simon Strategic Research to run a largescale messaging 
research project throughout 2019. This project sought to determine 
the most effective messages around issues of immigrant detention 
by conducting intensive research. Throughout 2019, the project 
conducted three phases: 1) goals and hypotheses development 
and landscape research, 2) mindset mapping and persuasion 
development, 3) persuasion strategies development and testing, 
and the following outcomes were met:
• Conducted five one-on-one in-depth stakeholder 
interviews of thought leaders that represent various 
sectors that relate to immigrant detention and work 
either nationally or in the following states: California, 
Georgia, Indiana, or Texas
• Conducted a media audit through the review of 1,343 
articles on topics related to immigrant detention
• Selected 46 articles related to immigration detention for 
in-depth social listening analysis
• Conducted an online focus group among 30 participants 
from California, Georgia, Indiana, New Mexico, and Texas
• Conducted in-person focus groups in Indiana, Georgia, 
and California
• Conducted an online survey of 622 registered voters in 
California, Georgia, Texas, Indiana, and New Mexico
The project concluded with message recommendations tailored 
to different audiences. Throughout 2020, the Network will 
distribute the toolkit with members and allies to help amplify 
their communications strategy and deliver effective messaging on 
detention issues. DWN is investing in members’ capacity as spokespeople, knowing 
how important it is to ensure that local media and national outlets 
are exposing the full narrative of immigration detention. To 
that end, DWN began a partnership with member organization 
Opportunity Agenda and created a three-part spokesperson 
curriculum for grassroots members: Narrative and Messaging for 
Long-Term Change; Telling your Own Detention Story; and Train 
the Trainer, where participants will learn the necessary facilitation 
skills to present on the first two modules. DWN rolled out the first 
module during a spokesperson training in Los Angeles in November 
2019. Over 40 members attended the training where participants 
learned messaging tactics, compelling story-telling, and effective 
delivery based on target audiences.

UPDATES & ACHIEVEMENTS
501C3
SPIN-OFFOn January 1, 2020, DWN spun off from Tides as its fiscal sponsor 
and became an independent 501c3. The organization shifted its 
Steering Committee to a formal governing Board of Directors, 
developed its own personnel and financial policies, and selected 
benefits and payroll providers.
GROWING 
STAFFTo build our capacity in our fight to end detention, DWN has grown 
significantly in the last year. Throughout 2019, DWN expanded its 
team to increase the Network’s programmatic and administrative 
capacity to support the growing membership and campaigns. The 
Network hired an Advocacy Associate, Field Advocacy Manager, TX-
based Organizer, CA-based Organizer, Communications Associate, 
Development Associate, and Administrative Associate. At the end 
of 2019, DWN is fully staffed with 13 personnel, based in DC, IL, TX, 
WA, and CA.Photo by Fernando Lopez

ORGANIZATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY
DWN recognizes the demanding work it takes to fight immigration incarceration. As such, the 
Network believes in investing in the wellness and success of our team to help them sustain and grow 
in this work. In 2019, DWN incorporated various practices for organizational sustainability including 
digital security, new offices, political education, staff wellness fund and a wellness retreat. These 
practices are elaborated below:
• DWN held an all-staff wellness retreat in Miami in May, aimed at fostering team building 
and promoting restorative practices. The staff participated in a StrengthsFinder team blend 
activity, continued work on organizational racial equity practices, toured the Everglades, 
and held a social gathering with south Florida-based members.
• DWN opened a new office in Chicago, IL in May 2019.
• DWN introduced digital security protocols and invested in secure technology for 
messaging, videoconferencing, and file-sharing. The Network also worked with a 
consultant to educate staff in understanding the technicalities of digital security.
• DWN introduced the wellness fund for staff, where all staff are eligible for up to $500 
per year to cover costs related to wellness (talk therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, 
physical fitness, etc.).
• DWN staff began monthly political education sessions, wherein a different member of 
staff leads a political education session on their topic of choice, contributing to leadership 
development and collective learning.
• DWN began the practice of holding racial “affinity caucus” sessions during all-staff in-
person gatherings.
