These agencies are plagued by a culture of violence and system wide abuses. And yet, the federal government wastes more than $25 billion each year on ICE and CBP to profile, jail, and deport immigrants. Instead, our tax dollars need to be used to strengthen our families and communities.The Defund Hate Campaign is led by a coalition of organizations that represent directly impacted immigrant communities, faith leaders, and civil and immigrant rights advocates.We are committed to divestment from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), agencies that tear apart loved ones and harm our communities. Instead, we want our tax dollars used to strengthen our families and communities. We are committed to investment in education, housing, green infrastructure and health care programs that create thriving communities.TAKE ACTIONSIGN UPExpanding Attacks Against ImmigrantsToday, in the United States of America#DefundHate in ActionQuestions?
