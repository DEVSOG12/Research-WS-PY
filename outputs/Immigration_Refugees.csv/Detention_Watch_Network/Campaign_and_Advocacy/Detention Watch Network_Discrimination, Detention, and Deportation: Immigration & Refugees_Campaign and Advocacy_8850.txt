C:0 M:68 Y:98 K:04 COLOUR PRINTICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit1I.  Introduction: ICE’s reckless fiscal management of 
its abusive system of immigration jails   
Since its creation, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s immigration enforcement 
actions have become increasingly capricious. This trend has deepened in the last year with 
the unapologetic arrests of victims of domestic violence,1 children in need of emergency 
medical care,2 activists who dared speak out,3 people seeking redress for wage theft,4 
recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA),5 individuals erroneously 
entered into gang databases who were actually victims of gang violence,6 asylum seekers 
who arrive at the border with their children,7 and more. Fueled by anti-immigrant rhetoric 
coming from the highest levels of government, Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) officers compound these arrests by engaging in blanket refusals to release immigrants 
from detention during the pendency of deportation proceedings8 and persisting in abusive 
treatment along the entire continuum of immigration enforcement.9  
Current U.S. immigration policy is driven in large part by the criminalization, scapegoating 
and targeting of people of color, inflicting trauma on immigrant communities and our society 
at large.  This report proposes that ICE’s patterns of irresponsible governance—includ -
ing fiscal mismanagement and opacity in detention operations—contribute to a fail -
ure of accountability for its ongoing rights violations.  Addressing these good governance 
concerns would not address all the problems in the system, or even the worst of them, but 
would constitute a critical first step toward oversight that has been sorely lacking on the 
part of Congress and independent oversight bodies like the DHS Office of Inspector General. 
This report lays out three serious concerns about ICE’s governance of the immigration de -
tention system: 
              1)  Misrepresentations of its so-called operational need for detention space; 
              2)  Inflated detention cost estimates and willingness to prioritize the demands 
of prison contractors over responsible stewardship; and 
              3)  Disregard for congressional oversight. 
In response to ICE’s reckless actions, Detention Watch Network and the National Immigrant 
Justice Center recommend that: 
1) Congress harness its oversight capacity by denying ICE’s irresponsible funding requests 
and meaningfully enforcing legislative checks on ICE’s detention authority; 
2) The DHS Office of the Inspector General intensify existing investigations and open new 
investigations of detention facilities and ICE’s contracting, inspections, and costs modeling.   ICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit2        II.  ICE artificially inflates  
its “operational needs.”
The past 25 years have seen an unrelenting expansion of ICE’s network 
of immigration jails. In 1994, approximately 6,800 people were held in 
immigration custody on any given day.10 That number steadily increased over 
years, hovering between 28,000 and 34,000 for most of the past decade.11 In 
a rapid spike over the past two years, detention numbers are now at highs 
previously unimaginable. In fiscal year 2017, ICE jailed a daily average of 
nearly 40,500 people.12 The White House has requested increased funding to 
bring that number above 51,000 in fiscal year 2018.13 ICE consistently claims 
its persistent drive toward expansion is necessitated by operational needs. 
These claims do not hold up to scrutiny today, nor have they in the past. 
Government agencies must justify their annual budget requests in written 
presentations to Congress. For its requested increase in detention funding 
for fiscal year 2018, ICE’s written justification relied on the expectation that 
the White House’s January 2017 Executive Order on interior immigration 
enforcement would lead to an increase in the average detention population.14 
Nowhere does the Executive Order15 or the memo implementing it16 explicitly 
call for increased detention capacity. Rather, the Executive Order designates 
new categories of immigrants residing in the United States as priorities for 
removal while precluding ICE from “exempt[ing] classes or categories of 
removable [immigrants] from potential enforcement.”17 In its budget justifica -
tion, ICE jumps to the conclusion that these changes in policy will lead to two 
relevant trends: 1) an increase in arrests, charging documents, and detainers 
issued against immigrants residing in the United States; and 2) an increase in 
the average length of stay in detention due to the more complex deportation 
defenses presented by long-time residents.18 
ICE’s claimed justifications for detention expansion are baseless. Even in light of the Janu -
ary Executive Order, the agency continues to maintain complete discretion  over the breadth 
of its enforcement activities, including the number of people arrested and the decision 
to detain or release individuals pending their immigration court proceedings. In no way 
does the Executive Order or its implementing memo require ICE to arrest and detain more 
people or to hold them for longer. 
Rather, ICE is choosing to engage in 
massive interior enforcement op -
erations targeting long-time com -
munity residents19 while quietly 
shifting toward a policy of de facto 
mandatory detention for all asy -
lum seekers.20 ICE then presents 
these skyrocketing numbers to 
Congress and asserts an operation -
al need for detention beds. Even 1994People in ICE

Even as American infrastructure needs

of new taxpayer dollars to fund a need 
that doesn’t exist.ICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit3as American infrastructure needs go ignored21 and health care providers lack vital funds to 
treat victims of the opioid epidemic,22 ICE begs for billions of new taxpayer dollars to fund 
a need that doesn’t exist. There is no reason that immigrants and asylum seekers who for 
decades have lived safely and productively in our communities must now be imprisoned. 
A recent example of ICE’s manipulation of the budget process occurred in September, when 
agency leaks revealed that ICE was planning a massive nationwide enforcement operation 
that would have been historic in size, called “Operation Mega” and intended to target 8,400 
immigrants.23  Immediately after the news went public, ICE announced that the operation 
had been postponed due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.24 Had it occurred, the operation 
would have jumped the number of those detained from approximately 38,000 to a figure 
much closer to the 51,000 requested by the White House for fiscal year 2018, only weeks be -
fore the end of the fiscal year and just as congressional appropriators negotiated the 2018 
spending bill. The timing and numbers strongly suggest that ICE was using this operation 
to artificially inflate the number of those in its custody—to “goose” its detention numbers, 
as Politico reported—for the purpose of presenting a larger “operational need” estimate in 
end-of-year appropriations negotiations.25 
Alonso Yáñez/La OpiniónICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit4        III.  ICE manipulates its bed costs, benefiting 
detention contractors and endangering 
immigrants.  
ICE’s continued requests for more money—and claims to congressional appropriators that 
its costs are rising—all come while ICE aggressively seeks to weaken the standards that 
govern immigration detention.26 This drive to weaken standards is not surprising given ICE’s 
reliance on the private prison industry for the growth and maintenance of the immigration 
detention system, with at least 65 per -
cent of all immigration jails operated by 
for-profit companies.27 The remainder  
of ICE’s detention system relies on part -
nerships with local jails that were never 
intended for this purpose and therefore 
struggle to meet existing standards. ICE 
has long claimed that the most recent 
and robust set of detention standards are 
costly for private prison companies and 
county jails to implement. Given these 
perverse financial incentives, an increase 
in funding from Congress will mean in -
creasing profit margins for detention 
contractors while conditions become even 
more dangerous for immigrants.
Noting this drive to weaken standards, ICE’s claims of rising costs are suspect, particular -
ly when used as a justification for increased funding. It is well documented that for-profit 
private prison companies already cut corners to drive down  costs, maximizing profits28 and 
putting lives at risk.29 Local jails likewise engage in cost-cutting behavior to maximize net 
revenue from ICE contracts. Fur -
thermore, contracts with local jails 
often include extremely low per 
diem payments—some as low at $30 
per day30—raising further questions 
about claims that costs are rising. 
These combined factors of weak -
ening standards, profit-driven and 
revenue-maximizing contractors, 
and a seemingly insatiable appetite 
for increased detention funding 
should give Congress pause and 
prompt more thorough investigation 
into the veracity of claims about in -
creasing costs per detention bed. These combined factors of weakening 
standards, profit-driven and revenue-
maximizing contractors, and a 
seemingly insatiable appetite for 
increased detention funding should 
give Congress pause and prompt 
more thorough investigation into the 
veracity of claims about increasing 
costs per detention bed.
Otay MesaICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit5        IV.  ICE ignores U.S. law and  
congressional oversight.
In the instances where Congress has attempted to intervene and provide some much-need -
ed oversight of ICE’s detention operations, ICE has been largely non-compliant or evasive . 
Fiscal mismanagement:
In recent years, Congress has chastised ICE for its chronic fiscal mismanagement but failed 
to hold the agency accountable for continued bad behavior. In May 2017, Congress passed 
a supplemental appropriations bill providing ICE with $2.6 billion to massively increase its 
detention capacity.31 In the bipartisan report language accompanying the bill, Congress took 
ICE to task for its “lack of fiscal discipline and cavalier management of funding for deten -
tion operations.”32 Specifically, congressional appropriators noted that ICE’s forecasting of 
its daily population as well as its daily bed rate calculations were not only “unrealistic” but 
“not based on a validated cost estimation methodology,” resulting in forecasting that had 
“missed the mark by wide margins” for several years.33 
Having provided supplemental funding, Congress nonetheless warned ICE that it was not in 
fact “funded by an indefinite appropriation,” instructing the agency to “manage-to-budget 
and [not] operate under the false perception that Congress will provide a bail out if financial 
controls fail or are simply ignored.”34 Perhaps unsurprisingly, less than three months later 
ICE returned to Congress requesting exactly such a bailout—$91 million in additional funds 
to be “reprogrammed” toward detention beds.35 Nearly 200 civil society organizations spoke 
out against this shocking display of inhumanity and fiscal irresponsibility.36 The request was 
nonetheless granted, likely emboldening ICE to continue its pattern of fiscal mismanage -
ment and fueling its expectation of ever-increasing funding.
In addition to its alarming disregard for Congress’s concern regarding its absence of budget -
ary controls, ICE persistently flouts congressional efforts to impose checks on ICE’s imple -
mentation of detention standards, inspections of facilities’ compliance with those stan -
dards, and widespread problems with detention contracting.
Detention standards:
Congress has long signaled that ICE needs to improve detention standards across its vast 
network of over 200 detention facilities, the majority of which are run by contractors. The 
DHS Appropriations Act of 2017 requires ICE to include the most recent set of immigration 
detention standards (referred to as the Performance Based National Detention Standards 
of 2011, or PBNDS 2011) in all new or newly modified detention contracts, with a written jus -
tification required in the case of deviation.37 Congress also carried forward a requirement 
that ICE report on its progress implementing the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and the 
PBNDS 2011 standards in general.38  
Despite the clear direction from Congress that ICE needs to be making significant progress 
toward having all facilities be compliant with the requirements of PREA and the most ICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit6current version of detention standards, ICE has done neither. A shocking 151 detention 
facilities—more than three quarters of the facilities in ICE’s detention system—are 
contracted to the lowest level of detention standards from 2000.39 ICE has also signed or 
reactivated 54 detention contracts just in the past year requiring these outdated 2000 
standards, in direct violation of Congress’s mandate.40 NIJC and DWN are unaware of any 
reporting by ICE to Congress to provide the justification Congress has required for each of 
these facilities. 
Facility Inspections:
Beginning in fiscal year 2009, Congress added report language to the DHS Appropriations 
bill requiring that ICE terminate contracts for any facility that failed two consecutive 
inspections.41 Congress has also required ICE to “provide an update on its oversight of adult 
and family detention facilities” including “information on the number of detention facility 
inspections conducted, [and] detailed results of the inspections.”42 Congress has made clear 
its expectation that ICE’s system of detention inspections be meaningful, transparent and, 
where appropriate, create consequences sufficient to ensure compliance with required 
standards. 
At odds with this mandate, ICE’s inspections regime is woefully inadequate. In an 
astounding 40 percent of known detention facilities including short- and long-term use, 
the only inspections conducted are performed by ICE field office or facility staff in a so-
called “Organizational Review Self-Assessment” that includes no independent monitoring 
or review.43 The remainder of the detention facilities are subject to annual inspections by 
ICE’s own Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division with occasional inspections 
by the Office of Detention Oversight, an office also housed within ICE. The annual ERO 
inspections are fundamentally flawed. They are not independent, and often do not include 
interviews with detained people. They provide advance notice to the facilities and look for 
the existence of policies rather than evidence that the policies are followed. They often 
misrepresent conditions inside the facility, for example counting an indoor room with a 
skylight as outdoor recreation.44 Even in the limited instances where inspections do identify 
violations of standards, ICE rarely imposes corresponding significant consequences. 
The stakes couldn’t be higher. A recent review of ICE investigations into deaths in detention 
found that in nearly half, medical neglect or the violation of medical standards was a 
contributing, or even causal, factor.45 Despite this, in all but one case, the responsible facility 
passed its inspection immediately before and immediately after the death.46 Furthermore, 
a recent limited series of unannounced spot inspections of ICE facilities conducted by DHS’s 
Office of the Inspector General revealed the gravity of the problems hidden when ICE 
inspects itself; in five of the six facilities it inspected the OIG found deficiencies so significant 
as to undermine ICE’s ability to provide a safe environment for detained individuals.47  
To compound this, organizations have raised concerns48 that ICE is holding final inspection 
results pending for long periods of time. This undermines the integrity of the inspections 
regime and prevents failed inspections from triggering the congressionally-mandated 
consequence of a terminated contract. Information recently obtained through Freedom of 
Information Action (FOIA) litigation shows that ICE continues to exploit this loophole, with 
seven results pending for more than three months and an additional 10 pending for more 
than a year as of July 2017.49   ICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit7Given the life or death implications of these standards, and ICE’s own inability or unwill -
ingness to exact consequences, the congressional mandate that ICE stop contracting with 
facilities with the worst track records is even more important, and ICE’s choice to evade 
meaningfully implementing it even more alarming. 
Detention contracting:
Congress has also used the appropria -
tions process to raise concerns about ICE’s 
inconsistent and inadequate contracting 
practices. In fiscal year 2017, appropria -
tors were uncharacteristically blunt, say -
ing “ICE must also improve its contracting 
process for detention beds,” continuing on 
to note that ICE has “neither a standard 
template for contracts nor a consistent 
method for Field Offices to validate  
invoices.”50
Given that the overwhelming majority 
of detention facilities are operated by 
contractors, basic contracting practice 
should be a core competency for ICE. 
Instead, the lack of a “standard template” results in widespread poor practice. The contracts 
for 159 detention facilities do not have expiration dates.51 Since the process of renewing 
a contract often offers the best window for addressing chronic problems at a facility or 
updating standards, the fact that 79 percent of all facilities never go through this process 
raises questions about the degree to which ICE is actually controlling, or even seeking to 
control, its contractors.
Taken together, the degree to which ICE has ignored or evaded basic congressional guid -
ance regarding detention standards, inspections and contracting, affirms the picture of 
an out of control and unaccountable agency. Oversight entities within Congress, as well as 
independent oversight bodies like the DHS Office of Inspector General and the Government 
Accountability Office, must take immediate action to address these pervasive concerns.
Taken together, the degree to 
which ICE has ignored or evaded 
basic congressional guidance 
regarding detention standards, 
inspections and contracting, affirms 
the picture of an out of control and 
unaccountable agency.
Otay MesaICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit8V. Recommendations
Congress must: 
1)  Cut rather than expand appropriated funds for immigration enforcement and detention, 
and deny any subsequent reprogramming requests for additional detention money be -
tween appropriation cycles. 
2)  Take steps to meaningfully enforce congressional oversight language through the with -
holding of funds. 
The DHS Office of the Inspector General must: 
1)  Complete and publicly publish the findings of its investigations into ICE’s detention con -
tracting and inspections.
2)  Continue unannounced spot inspections of ICE detention facilities and continue publicly 
publishing its findings. 
3)  Open investigations into the integrity of ICE cost modeling and bed space forecasting.
VI. Conclusion 
ICE’s fiscal mismanagement, opacity in custody operations, and unchecked contracting and 
inspection systems create fertile ground for abuses and rights violations. In a system lack -
ing in the accountability and oversight that are fundamental to basic good governance, the 
price is paid in human suffering. ICE’s bias toward jailing more immigrants and for longer 
periods—and its willingness to abandon the basic tenets of good governance to support 
that bias—leads to unnecessary deaths, people struggling for months and years behind 
bars as their mental and physical health deteriorate, and children needlessly separated 
from their parents. Addressing these management concerns would not solve the larger 
issues with criminalizing, scapegoating and targeting immigrant communities, or the exis -
tence of an inhumane and unnecessary detention system, but would be one important step 
forward. ICE’s reckless actions, driven by an administration intent on demonizing immigrant 
communities, have created an imperative for Congress and oversight bodies like the DHS 
Office of Inspector General to engage in robust and meaningful oversight immediately. ICE Lies: Public Deception, Private Profit91  Jonathan Blitzer, The New Yorker, “The woman arrested by

or agreements meet or exceed the Performance Based 
National Detention Standards (PBNDS) 2011, as revised 
in 2016 and which were in effect on January 1, 2017, 
unless the Secretary submits a report to the Committees 
on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of

rationale for requiring changed standards.” See page 70,
