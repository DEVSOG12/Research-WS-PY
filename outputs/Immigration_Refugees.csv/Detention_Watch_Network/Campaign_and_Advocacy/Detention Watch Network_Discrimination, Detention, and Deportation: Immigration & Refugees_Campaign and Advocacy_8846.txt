As An Alternative To Immigrant Incarceration.  April 22,2019. And Vera Institute of Justice. Evidence Shows 
That Most Immigrants Appear for Immigration Court Hearings.  October 2020. Every day, thousands of people 
are cruelly deprived of their 
liberty in a vast system of mass 
immigration detention in the 
United States. For years, detained 
people and advocates have 
organized to close troubled 
immigration detention centers 
and exposed the horrors of 
a detention system rife with 
extreme negligence, abuse, and 
even death. 
Numerous studies document 
that detention is also wholly 
unnecessary.1 Despite 
overwhelming evidence that 
immigrants successfully navigate 
their immigration cases in 
community, the immigration 
detention system — now with over 
230 facilities in the United States 
— has seen exponential growth 
across the last three presidential 
administrations. In just the last 
four years, the number of people 
detained by Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) grew 
dramatically to an average daily 
population of more than 50,000 
people in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, by 
far the most in the agency’s history. This unprecendented expansion 
of detention was propelled not by 
changing migration trends, but 
by a resurgence of nativist and 
xenophobic rhetoric translated 
into harsher policies towards both 
arriving immigrants and long-term 
non-citizen residents. Detention 
expansion continued under the 
Trump administration despite 
draconian enforcement policies 
such as the Migrant Protection 
Protocols (MPP), the expansion 
of the border wall, and Title 
42, meant to keep people from

ICE’s detention budget has grown 
steadily since the creation of 
the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) nearly 20 years 
ago. In FY 2020 the immigration 
detention budget alone was 
nearly $3.2 billion, 3.5 times what 
it was in 2005.2 In FY 2021, it was 
reduced to $2.8 billion following

a steep reduction in the number 
of people detained during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.3
The astronomical growth of 
ICE detention over the last 
15 years is in many ways an 
outlier. Many state and federal 
adult and juvenile correctional 
systems are incarcerating fewer 
people, spending less money on 
incarceration, and closing prisons 
and detention facilities. In some 
cases, prison and jail systems have 
been downsized with the input of 
community advisory panels, and 
in many places prisons and youth 
detention centers have been 
closed and repurposed into non-
punitive institutions.
Many community advocates and 
elected leaders cite economic 
concerns as an argument against 
detention center closures. While 
there is little research into the 
economic impact of ICE detention 
centers on local communities, 
numerous studies show prisons 
do not foster long-term economic 
growth, especially in persistently

construction correlates with 
lower increases in employment, 
retail sales, household wages, 
housing units, and home values 
as compared to towns without 
prisons.4
Still, local officials say their 
communities need to identify 
alternative forms of development 
should detention centers 
close. This report looks at the 
literature on prisons, economic 
development, and trend lines in 
adult and youth incarceration 
around the country, as well as 
data about the immigration 
detention system. It draws on 
interviews with more than 20 
community organizers, advocates, 
lawyers, and experts on 
immigration detention and adult 
and juvenile prison systems. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the number of people detained 
by ICE fell to lows not seen in 20 
years. As of April 1, 2021, ICE’s 
detained population was 14,077.5 
The emptying of detention PAGE 7
centers over the past year has 
further called into question 
the purpose of immigration 
detention, a punitive system 
which only exists to ensure 
immigrants are in compliance 
with their immigration cases. 
In fact, recent data shows 
that non-detained immigrants 
attend their court dates at 
rates nearing 100 percent.6 The 
Biden administration should 
6 The Vera Institute for Justice found that nearly all non-detained immigrants with legal representation 
appeared in court. See Vera Institute of Justice. Evidence Shows That Most Immigrants Appear for 
Immigration Court Hearings.  October 2020. Similarly, TRAC found that 99% of asylum-seekers who were 
not detained attended every one of their court hearings. TRAC. Record Number of Asylum Cases in FY 
2019.  January 8, 2020.take this opportunity to release 
people currently detained and 
allow them to navigate their 
immigration cases in community, 
while placing a moratorium 
on detaining people anew. 
Further, the U.S. government 
should implement the following 
policies and recommendations 
that begin to phase out the 
use of immigration detention 
completely.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
• The Biden administration 
should begin phasing out the 
use of immigration detention 
by immediately ending 
detention center contracts 
and halting expansion 
efforts. As of April 2021, the 
number of people detained 
by ICE was 14,077. As the 
COVID-19 pandemic continues, 
the administration should 
immediately release people 
from immigration detention 
as an urgent public health measure and implement 
policies that begin shrinking 
the detention system. These 
policies include ending family 
detention, releasing individuals 
and families to navigate 
their cases in community, 
halting transfers within the 
immigration detention system 
and from prisons and jails, 
ending contracts with private 
prison corporations and state 
and local governments, and 
halting all expansion efforts. PAGE 8
• The Biden administration and 
Congress should significantly 
reduce immigration 
detention funding.  The Biden 
administration and Congress 
should rein in detention costs, 
and set a goal of year-over-year 
reductions in ICE detention 
funding. As a start, FY 2022 
detention funding levels should 
be cut by 75 percent from the 
2021 detention budget.  
• The Biden administration 
should end detention at the 
border by decriminalizing 
migration and restoring access 
to asylum.  President Biden has 
already taken steps towards 
rolling back Trump’s anti-
immigrant regime by ending 
the racist Muslim and African 
bans and suspending the 
Migrant Protection Protocols 
(MPP). He should go further, 
however, to completely end 
MPP and other policies that 
turn people away at the 
border or funnel them into 
the detention system, end 
the Title 42 closure of the 
border which public health 
experts have said has no 
public health justification,7 
and end all other fast-track 
7 For example, see Letter to Acting HHS Secretary Cochran and CDC Director Walensky . January 28, 2021. removal policies which result 
in detention and deportation. 
The administration should 
also decriminalize the act 
of migration to shrink the 
pipeline into federal immigrant 
incarceration and detention.
• The Biden administration 
and Congress should set up 
a Just Transition Economic 
Development Fund.  Using cost 
savings from reduced spending 
on detention, Congress and 
the administration should 
create a $1 billion fund housed 
outside of the Department 
of Homeland Security to 
provide grants to communities 
transitioning away from 
economies dependent on 
federal detention. The multi-
year fund should be guided 
by an advisory committee of 
formerly detained people, 
economic development 
advisors, and elected and 
community leaders from 
communities transitioning away 
from detention economies 
while investing in economic 
development opportunities not 
tied to other punitive forms of 
infrastructure.PAGE 9

with private prisons, family detention centers, contracts built off of riders with US Marshals detention 
centers, and Service Processing Centers owned by ICE itself. For more information on these kinds of

facilities owned by ICE itself.9 
According to a Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) 
report released in January, ICE 
used about 180 of these facilities 
in FY 2019.10
People in ICE detention include 
those seeking asylum, long-time 
permanent residents facing 
deportation proceedings after 
an interaction with the criminal legal system, and individuals and 
families awaiting immigration 
court dates.
ICE’s detention system has an 
extensively documented history 
of egregious conditions including 
lack of basic hygienic products, 
inadequate and rotten food, 
physical and sexual abuse, 
exposure to toxic chemicals,11 
and medical abuse and neglect.12 
A growing number of people in 
ICE detention have spoken out 
or protested their confinement, 
including by participating in 
hunger strikes to bring attention 
to the dire situation. They have at 
times been met with retaliation 
including alleged legal threats to 
deny their asylum cases13 and the PAGE 10
use of riot police and pepper spray.14 
ICE’s detention system has proven 
traumatic and deadly to those 
it detains. As of September 
2020, 217 people had died in ICE 
custody since 2004. In FY 2020 
alone, 21 people died in ICE 
detention, including eight from 
COVID-19. This was the highest

detained people, public health

federal judges to free people, 
halt transfers, and take other 
public health precautions. The

results were predictable, with 
ICE detention centers becoming 
hotbeds of COVID-19 infection, 
and contributing to an estimated 
additional 245,000 COVID cases 
in areas surrounding detention 
centers between May and  
August 2020.16
Despite these failures, the 
detention system has expanded 
dramatically. The number of 
people detained in ICE custody 
increased from an average daily 
population of just over 21,000 in 
FY 200317 to more than 50,000 in 
FY 2019.18
As FY 2020 began, ICE detained 
an average of 48,628 people on 
any given day. Amid the COVID-19 
pandemic, the number of people 
detained by ICE has fallen to lows 
not seen in 20 years. By the end 
of FY 2020, this number dropped 
to an average of 33,417, in part 
because more than 197,000

ICE’s total budget nearly tripled 
from $3.3 billion in 2003 to $8.4 
billion in FY 2020.21 ICE’s overall 
budget was reduced only slightly 
to $7.97 billion for FY 2021.22 ICE’s 
budget for custody operations 
(detention) has increased even 
more rapidly, jumping from 
$864 million in 2005 to nearly 
$3.2 billion in FY 2020, nearly 
equal to the size of the agency’s 
entire 2003 budget. In recent 
years advocates have fought 
hard to successfully block at least 
$12 billion in additional funds 
to ICE and Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP). Despite these 
efforts and the recent dramatic 
drop in detention numbers, ICE’s 
FY 2021 detention budget, passed 
by Congress and signed by Trump, PAGE 12
continues to provide funding of 
$2.8 billion for 34,000 detention

constrained by Congressional 
appropriations. However, under

detention expansion drive.25
For FY 2021, the Trump 
administration requested that 
taxpayers fund ICE custody 
operations at $4.1 billion, in part 
for expanding family detention, 
for a total detention capacity of 
60,000. Despite demands from 
advocacy groups and a House 
proposal that would have further 
reduced capacity, Congress 
ultimately approved $2.8 billion 
dollars for ICE to fund 34,000 
detention beds,26 far exceeding 
the 16,135 people who were 
detained on average by ICE in 
December when the budget  
was passed.27
According to a report by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, 
Human Rights Watch, and 
National Immigrant Justice Center, 
the Trump administration opened 
over 40 new ICE detention 
centers. By the end of 2019, more 
than 25 percent of people in ICE 
custody were held in these newly-
contracted facilities, most of 
which are more than two hours

formerly used as prisons, and 
are operated by private prison 
companies. 
A Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) report released 
earlier this year found that ICE 
did not follow its own processes 
entering into these new contracts. 
The GAO found that 28 of the 
40 new contracts signed during 
the Trump administration “did 
not have documentation from 
ICE field offices showing a need 
for the space, outreach to local 
officials, or the basis for ICE’s 
decisions to enter into them, 
as required by ICE’s process.”28 
Furthermore, more than 80 
percent of detention center 
contracts are Intergovernmental 
Service Agreements (IGSAs) 
between ICE and a local 
government.These contracts allow 
for the use of county or city jails 
and can also be subcontracted 
to a private prison company. 
IGSAs allow DHS to use less 
stringent competition and past PAGE 14

offices themselves raised concerns 
about some of the new contracts, 
including their remote nature and

deaths, and abuse. These 
concerns were overruled by ICE 
headquarters which justified the 
new facilities.30
WHO PROFITS FROM  
ICE’S DETENTION ECONOMY?
Detention centers are deeply 
harmful and at times deadly. The 
U.S. immigration detention system 
— which has been condemned by 
people in detention, their loved 
ones, and advocates as unjust 
and unnecessary — is designed to 
incentivize the incarceration of 
immigrants as a money making 
scheme for corporations and local 
governments.
While the argument against 
detention is fundamentally a 
moral one, local debates over 
immigration detention often 
center around the economic 
impact of detention centers on 
local economies. Little or no 
published research examines the 
economic impact of immigration 
detention centers on local 
communities. However, ample research over the 
course of nearly 20 years shows 
that prisons more broadly do 
not foster economic growth. In 
2003, a study by Terry Besser and 
Margaret Hansen demonstrated 
that towns with new prisons 
experienced lower increases

in employment, retail sales, 
household wages, housing units 
and home values.31 In 2007, Amy 
Glasmeier and Tracey Farrigan 
compared 55 rural counties with 
prisons constructed between 
1985 and 1995 to similar counties 
without prisons finding “little 
evidence of prisons fostering 
economic growth especially in 
persistently poor communities.”32
Similarly, in 2010, Greg Hooks and 
his colleagues found that prisons

counties, “especially in counties 
that lag behind in educational 
attainment.” This built upon 
Hooks’ 2004 findings that 
counties that built prisons in slow-
growing rural economies between 
1969 and 1994 ended up worse 
off than comparative counties 
that did not build prisons.33
The positive economic impact of 
detention centers on for-profit 
prison corporations’ bottom lines

is much more clear. By 2020, 
81 percent of all immigrants in 
detention were locked up in for-
profit facilities. CoreCivic and GEO 
Group (GEO) are the two publicly 
traded corporations that operate 
most of ICE’s for-profit detention 
beds. In 2019, together CoreCivic 
and GEO brought in more than 
$1.2 billion in revenue from ICE 
contracts, with approximately 
29 percent of each company’s 
revenue coming from ICE.34 35
Both publicly traded private prison 
companies are also financially 
troubled. CoreCivic and GEO’s 
access to capital markets has 
been restricted in part due to 
divestment activism.36 Bond-rating 
agency Fitch even withdrew its 
bond rating of CoreCivic noting 
that “the private prison sector also 
faces negative headwinds from 
social pressures, and longer-term 
correctional trends are shifting 
away from imprisonment of 
nonviolent offenders and toward 
rehabilitation and reentry

Despite this, ICE has increasingly 
turned to long-term contracts 
with private prison companies. 
Even as the number of people 
in detention has declined 
dramatically due the pandemic, 
ICE continues to solicit requests 
for information for detention 
centers, including an active 
contract solicitation for a 700-bed 
detention center within 50 miles 
of Miami.38
Last summer, ICE signed 10-year 
contracts with CoreCivic for the 
T. Don Hutto Residential Center 
and Houston Contract Detention 
Facility and with GEO for its South 
Texas ICE Processing Center. 
CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger 
told investors in a subsequent 
conference call that ICE signing 
long-term contracts was a 
sign that the agency wanted 
to maintain its high levels of 
detention regardless of  
 
 PAGE 17
a potential change in presidential 
administrations.39
ICE contracts have also proven 
profitable to local government 
entities serving as intermediaries 
through Intergovernmental 
Service Agreements. Many IGSAs 
are pass-through agreements 
wherein a local government 
essentially subcontracts with a 
private prison corporation to 
operate a facility. ICE often prefers 
to enter into IGSAs with local

can bring facilities online more 
quickly, bypassing competitive 
bidding and past performance 
review requirements.40
Some of these private contractors 
pay the local government 
fees, though ICE does not put 
restrictions on these payments nor 
track the total amount of money 
local governments receive from 
IGSAs. In one case, the California 
State Auditor found that the City

DECARCERATION OF PRISON  
AND DETENTION SYSTEMS
As noted above, after years of 
astronomical detention growth, 
the number of people detained in 
the system dramatically reduced 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
in part because of the Title 42 
closure of the Southern border 
and legally dubious expulsion of 
asylum-seekers. Still, the overall 
trend of ICE detention has 
been one of consistent increase 
over the course of the last two 
decades.  
But not all systems of 
incarceration have followed this 
trend line in recent years. In fact, 
many adult prison, pre-trial jail, and juvenile detention systems 
have reduced their incarcerated 
populations, shrunk their 
budgets, and closed (and in some 
cases repurposed) prisons and 
detention centers. 
Between 2010 and 2019, 
the cumulative state prison 
population declined by more than 
148,000, for a ten year reduction 
of over ten percent. Similarly, 
the federal prison population 
incarcerated by the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons over the same 
time period decreased by more 
than 34,000, a ten year reduction 
of more than 15 percent.42 Over

the past decade, prisons and 
juvenile detention centers have 
closed rapidly. Between 2011 and 
2016, 94 state prisons and juvenile 
detention centers closed bringing 
48,000 prison beds offline.43
There are cautionary tales, 
however. In 2017, Louisiana, 
which has one of the highest 
rates of incarceration in the 
world, passed sentencing reforms 
that aimed to reduce the state 
prison population. In the years 
that followed, thousands of 
prison beds emptied, leaving 
many communities reeling from 
the consequent loss of jobs 
and revenue from the state. 
At the same time the Trump 
administration was on an 
immigration detention expansion 
spree and saw an opportunity in 
Louisiana for ICE to secure new 
detention contracts.44 By 2020, 
ICE had contracted with six new 
facilities for an additional capacity 
of more than 6,100 beds for 
immigration detention.45
Louisiana advocates had not 
anticipated the impact that the 
reduction of the incarcerated 
population would have and

by other agencies. Expecting 
pushback, some states developed 
transition planning committees 
to ensure that prisons closed even 
when faced with opposition from 
host communities or prison guard 
unions. New York and Michigan 
were among the states where 
state departments of correction 
closed the most prisons. 
In her report for The Sentencing 
Project, Nicole Porter describes 
the New York model that created 
the Empire State Development 
office as part of an Economic 
Transformation and Facility 
Redevelopment Program:
“Legislators authorized the 
program to support the 
economies of communities 
affected by the closure of 
certain correctional and 
juvenile justice facilities. 
Program staff convened 
conversations in the affected 
communities for the reuse of 
closed correctional facilities. 
The program also facilitated 
an economic development 
initiative with business firms 
interested in relocating to PAGE 21
affected communities through 
tax incentives.”46
In addition to closures, some 
localities have begun transitioning 
local economies and repurposing 
prison facilities. Repurposed adult 
prison projects include a movie 
studio in Staten Island, New 
York, a reentry center for women 
in Bayview, New York, a small 
farm incubator in Peoria, Illinois, 
homeless shelters in Gainesville, 
Florida and Haywood, North 
Carolina, and a distillery in Brushy 
Mountain, Tennessee.47

the Jail ATL: Communities Over 
Cages Campaign organized 
for years for the closure of the 
Atlanta City Detention Center 
(ACDC), a troubled city jail that 
had detained both people held 
for ICE and those arrested by 
local police and charged with 
“quality of life crimes” including 
public drinking or loitering. In 
May 2019, Mayor Keisha Lance 
Bottoms signed legislation that 
would direct the city to close the 
facility and created a task force 
for reimagining the use of  
the space.48
The Reimagining ACDC Task 
Force, composed of 62 members, 
including directly impacted 
people, advocates, and city 
and county officials, created 
a planning team to analyze 
three key areas: policy changes, 
programming, and building 
redesign. With the support of 
consultants including Designing 
Justice + Designing Spaces, the 
task force held listening sessions, 
town halls, and stakeholder 
interviews. In June 2020, the task 
force recommended the ACDC be

It further recommended 
constructing in ACDC’s place a 
Center for Equity and Wellness 
to “advance racial and economic 
equity, promote restorative 
justice, and invest in the well-
being of individuals, families,  
and communities.”49
Perhaps the most useful corollary 
to the proposed down-scaling 
of the immigration detention 
system is the decarceration of 
youth incarceration systems over 
the last 20 years. As immigration 
detention has climbed, the 
number of youth in detention has 
fallen dramatically. Between 1999 
and 2015, the number of youth in 
custody in the U.S. decreased by 
more than half.50 In the same time 
period, ICE detention steadily grew.
Reducing youth incarceration 
has allowed lawmakers to close 
detention centers. Between 2000 
and 2016, 1,275 youth detention 
facilities were closed. The biggest 
decline was in large facilities 
detaining more than  
200 children.51

A JUST TRANSITION FOR  
DETENTION COMMUNITIES
53 See previous Detention Watch Network policy recommendations for the Biden administration 
collected at this website .As the Biden administration 
takes shape, it should continue 
to decrease the population in 
detention by implementing 
a series of policies to release 
people from detention during an 
ongoing pandemic and steadily 
shrink the detention system. The 
Biden administration can use its 
executive authority in pursuit of 
these policy goals, though the 
administration should also pursue 
long-term legislative fixes to the 
system to phase out the use of 
immigration detention completely. 
Detention Watch Network has 
previously detailed how the Biden 
administration can reduce the 
detained population through 
a series of policy choices. These 
include immediately ending family 
detention; fulfilling its promise 
to end for-profit incarceration 
by extending its executive order 
phasing out private prisons 
to ICE private contracts and 
IGSAs with state and local 
governments; reducing the use 
of expedited removal (which triggers mandatory detention) by 
rescinding the Trump executive 
order expanding its use, with a 
long term goal of ending the use 
of expedited removal altogether; 
fully ending the Migrant 
Protection Protocols, Title 42, and 
other fast-track removal policies; 
and by decriminalizing the act  
of migration.53
Furthermore, the administration 
can use its authority to release 
people from detention in the 
interest of public health and halt 
all transfers within the detention 
system and from the criminal 
legal system to stop the spread 
of COVID-19. Best practices 
call for releases that do not 
involve ankle monitors or other 
forms of electronic surveillance. 
The Biden administration can 
shrink the pipeline to detention 
and deportation by rejecting 
a categorical approach to 
enforcement and ending the 
287g program, the Criminal Alien 
Program, and Secure Communities.PAGE 25
Using cost savings from 
reduced spending on 
detention by following the 
above recommendations, the 
administration can and should 
address the concerns raised by 
advocates and elected officials 
for investments in alternative 
economic development initiatives 
in their communities.

County, Texas, about an hour

Frio County Commissioner Jose 
Asuncion, who represents the 
part of the county that includes 
the South Texas Family Residential 
Facility, has long been a critic of 
the role for-profit prison industries 
have played in his community. 
In May 2020, Asuncion, along 
with other local officials, raised 
the alarm after the vast majority 
of local COVID-19 cases could be 
traced back to ICE’s negligence 
at the South Texas ICE Processing 
Center in Pearsall.57
Asuncion says that the private 
prison companies operating 
the ICE detention centers are 
a “dangerous presence” in his 
and other communities, taking 
advantage of communities 
without providing promised 
benefits. They have convinced 
localities to expand utilities and 
many of those communities have 
become dependent on the tax 
base, utility payments, and jobs 
centered around the detention 
centers. Asuncion says that 
conversations about transitioning 
away from detention centers

To address this kind of need, 
the Biden administration and 
Congress should develop a Just 
Transition Economic Development 
Fund to aid communities 
transitioning away from 
immigration detention economies. 
Congress and the administration 
should create a fund housed 
outside of the Department of 
Homeland Security to provide 
multi-year grants to communities 
where detention centers are closed. 
According to the Climate Justice 
Alliance, “Just Transition” is a 
term coined by labor unions and 
environmental justice activists 
who “saw the need to phase out 
the industries that were harming 
workers, community health and 
the planet; and at the same time 
provide just pathways for workers 
to transition to other jobs.”59 
With detention economies, 
there is a similar need to divest 
from harmful immigration 
detention centers and prisons 
while providing a pathway for 
sustainable economic development 
in these communities.

Development Fund should be

Efforts to incentivize

increasingly popular. As part 
of the proposed BREATHE Act, 
the Movement for Black Lives

localities reducing their jail 
populations and their spending 
on police. The proposal also 
calls for federal investment in 
non-punitive, community driven 
solutions — with both planning 
and implementation phases — to 
the issues that lead to criminal 
legal system involvement. The 
Free Them All grant program, a 
subsection of the BREATHE Act, 
proposes a 50 percent funding 
match to what local governments 
would save from decarceration 
efforts.60PAGE 28
CONCLUSION 
The U.S. immigration detention 
system, the largest of its kind in 
the world, has long been a cause 
for concern. Detained people 
and their loved ones, their legal 
representatives, and advocates 
routinely report egregious 
conditions in the jails and prisons 
used to detain immigrants. Due 
to the onerous nature of the U.S. 
immigration system and courts, 
immigrants spend months or 
even years in detention centers 
meant for short term stays. The 
profit motive — by both private 
prison corporations and local 
governments — is built deeply 
into the immigration detention 
system. All but five detention 
centers are subcontracted out 
to local governments or private 
corporations, that prioritize profit 
above care.
As states have reduced the 
number of people incarcerated 
in jails, prisons, and juvenile 
detention centers, the federal 
immigration detention system 
has only increased. Many local 
governments have become 
dependent on federal contracts 
for immigration detention to support their local budgets and 
have resisted detention closure. 
Private prison corporations have 
brought in billions from their 
ICE contracts and immigration 
detention has become a 
centerpiece of their financial 
model. Immigration detention 
reached its height in FY 2019 
when the U.S. government 
detained a record number of 
people — more than 50,000 on 
an average day — and spent 
$3.2 billion, another record, on 
detention alone.
The Biden administration has a 
unique opportunity to break this 
cycle and work towards an end 
to the unnecessary system of 
detention altogether. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the number 
of people detained by ICE fell to 
lows not seen in over 20 years. 
Just over 14,000 people were 
detained on April 1st. The Biden 
administration can and must 
continue to reduce the detained 
population and implement the 
recommendations put forward 
in this report in order to prevent 
the system from growing once the 
pandemic subsides. Immigrants PAGE 29
should be able to navigate their 
cases at home and in community, 
not behind bars in immigration 
detention. The goal should be the 
elimination of incarceration in the 
immigration system. Reducing 
the detention population would 
allow the Biden administration 
and Congress to also dramatically 
reduce ICE’s bloated detention 
budget, money that can then be 
reinvested in communities. 
As part of the process of phasing 
out the use of immigration 
detention entirely, the 
implementation of a multi-year Just Transition Economic 
Development Fund would provide 
incentives for communities to 
move away from economies 
dependent on the suffering of 
people in immigration detention 
and towards economies that 
create opportunities for whole 
communities to thrive.
