The reports were authored by DWN members and allies, including policy advocates, community organizers, legal service providers, faith groups and individuals personally impacted by detention, who together have deep experience and understanding of the immigration detention system. On November 28, 2012, 300 national and local organizations sent a letter to the White House, calling on President Obama to close these facilities while making immediate changes to ensure the safety, dignity and well-being of immigrants held in detention.Expose and Close 2012ReportExecutive SummaryReport (en Español)Resumen EjecutivoLetter to President ObamaExpose and Close 2012 Facility ReportsBaker County Jail, FloridaEtowah County Jail, AlabamaHouston Processing Center, TexasHudson County Jail, New JerseyIrwin County Detention Facility, GeorgiaPinal County Jail, ArizonaEn EspañolPolk County Detention Facility, TexasEn EspañolStewart Detention Center, GeorgiaEn EspañolTheo Lacy Detention Center, CaliforniaTri-County Detention Center, IllinoisIn 2013, DWN released Expose & Close: One Year Later, to review conditions in the original ten reports and shine the light on new facilities with egregious human rights violations.
