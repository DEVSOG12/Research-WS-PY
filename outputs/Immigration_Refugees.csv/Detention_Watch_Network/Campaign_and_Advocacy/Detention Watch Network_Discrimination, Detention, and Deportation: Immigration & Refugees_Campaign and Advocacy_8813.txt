The expansion of the system was in part due to an arbitrary quota from Congress, in place from 2009 until 2017, that required the incarceration of 34,000 immigrants in detention at any given time. This quota acted as an artificial floor, propping up the size of the detention system.The bed quota was removed during the funding negotiations of May 2017 after a long-fought campaign, but it was a hollow victory as the number of people held in immigration detention  far exceeded the original quota as the result of a surge in anti-immigrant policies throughout the Trump Administration and Congress continues to fund ICE detention at astronomical levels.While the national detention bed quota is gone, at least for now, an underlying network of local quotas remains written into detention contracts. These local quotas require ICE to pay for a minimum number of beds — that ICE is encouraged to fill and exceed — at key detention centers, most of which are involved with private prison corporations.Local quotas, referred to as guaranteed minimums in detention facility contracts, ensure a profit-stream and can be found in at least half of ICE’s field offices. These contractual provisions promise that ICE will pay for a certain number of detention beds regardless of how many people are detained to fill these beds. And as a perverse incentive, ICE agents are then encouraged to increase enforcement in order to maximize taxpayer dollars that are being spent to detain people. (See our report: Banking on Detention: Local Lockup Quotas & the Immigrant Dragnet)These quotas have become a rigid part of the immigration detention system and must be eliminated. Detention quotas are not only fiscally irresponsible and wasteful, but they help drive policies that continue to deprive liberty and separate immigrants from their loved ones.Learn More About Local Lockup QuotasDetention Watch Network and Center for Constitutional Rights ReportBanking on Detention: Local Lockup Quotas & the Immigrant DragnetDetention Watch Network and Center for Constitutional Rights ReportBanking on Detention 2016 UpdateThe IssuesDetention 101Mandatory DetentionDetention QuotasFamily DetentionDetention OversightFinancial IncentivesShadow PrisonsAlternativesStay InformedSign up to receive reports, action alerts, and our newsletter.Sign Up NowDonateHelp strengthen a network of advocates and activists around the country fighting for the dignity and rights of immigrants in detention.Donate NowStay InformedSign up to receive reports, action alerts, and our newsletter.Sign Up NowDonateHelp strengthen a network of advocates and activists around the country fighting for the dignity and rights of immigrants in detention.Donate NowContact UsContact UsView Jobs & InternshipsPrivacy PolicyDetention 101View the IssuesMember DirectoryView DirectoryConnect with UsPart of the International Detention Coalition.
