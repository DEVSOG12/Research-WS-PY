#DefundHate Campaign on Instagram: "President Biden released his initial top line budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2022. With a proposed increase to the DHS, Biden’s budget lacks any significant promises to decrease funding to ICE and CBP, two agencies that have operated with impunity to target and harm Black, brown and immigrant communities.Bigger budgets for ICE and CBP do not result in better conditions, but rather expose that these agencies are fundamentally flawed. All eyes are on President Biden to do what is right by including cuts to ICE and CBP funding in his full budget in exchange for greater investments in community-based resources that prioritize everyone’s safety, dignity and humanity. #DefundHate"
