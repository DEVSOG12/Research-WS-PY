#CommunitiesNotCages on Instagram: "#CommunitiesNotCages victory! Through community power and grassroots organizing, @wyosayno was successful in stopping the construction of a 1,000-bed immigration detention center in Wyoming proposed by private prison company CoreCovic. In a statement released on Wednesday, @wyosayno celebrated the victory: “This is a reason for all people who live in Wyoming and our neighboring states to celebrate. A 1,000-bed facility that would have cycled 800 people through it a month and would have caused the pain and suffering of so many of our neighbors will not be built.”"
