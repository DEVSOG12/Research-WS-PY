Introduction 
Since the World Health Organization 
(WHO) declared COVID-19 a global 
pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus 
has devastated communities around the 
world. The United States has seen more 
than twelve million confirmed cases 
at the time of writing this report, the 
highest in the world. 
The U.S. response to the deadly virus 
continues to be an example of what 
not to do, largely ignoring the advice of 
public health professionals and other 
experts, doing little to stop the spread 
of infection, and displaying a callous 
disregard for the safety and health of 
its residents. The results have been 
both tragic and predictable. Federal and 
state policies have been inconsistent 
and ineffective, and medical supplies 
(from personal protective equipment 
[PPE] to testing supplies) have been 
unavailable.1 In short, the U.S. has failed 
— and continues to fail — spectacularly. 
With roughly five percent of the world’s 
population, the U.S. accounts for 20 
percent of COVID-19 cases and deaths 
worldwide.2   
The response of Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the 
pandemic also played a role in 
the spread of COVID-19. The U.S. immigration detention system, operated 
by ICE, has a well-documented history 
of medically negligent and abhorrent 
conditions.3 Experts have long 
condemned the agency for violating 
international norms and placing the 
health and welfare of detained people at 
risk. Despite the overwhelming evidence, 
the restrictive and punitive detention 
system has continued to grow over 
the last several decades. While these 
defects and steady growth of the system 
predate 2016, the Trump administration 
further expanded the detention system, 
promoted punitiveness, and degraded 
health and safety conditions.4
ICE’s failure to release 
people from detention 
during the pandemic 
added over 245,000 cases 
to the total U.S. caseload.—   Page 4   —
In this context, it is not surprising 
that ICE detention facilities have 
been uniquely vulnerable to the 
novel coronavirus, with an infection 
rate that far outweighs the infection 
rate among the population. 
Immigration advocates and public 
health officials warned of these risks 
in March and made clear the only 
way forward was to immediately 
release people from detention 
so that they could safely socially 
distance. People in detention fearing 
for their lives have spoken out and 
protested, asking to be released in 
one of the few ways that they can: 
refusing meals. From March to July 
2020, nearly 2,500 people joined in 
COVID-19-related hunger strikes in 
detention centers nationwide.6
ICE refused to heed the warnings 
and even evaded court orders 
requiring them to reduce numbers.7  
As expected, the virus swept 
through the ICE detention system, 
impacting detained people and 
those working in detention facilities 
at disproportionate rates, as well as 
their families.8 
The impact of ICE’s failure to 
adequately respond to the pandemic The immigration detention system 
is cruel and unnecessary. Its defects 
are only heightened during a global 
health crisis. People navigating their 
immigration cases should be able to 
do so with their loved ones and in 
community, not behind bars. 
The only just and long-term 
solution is to free all people 
from detention. 
In the meantime,
1. ICE must immediately heed the 
advice of public health experts 
by significantly and quickly 
reducing the number of people in 
detention.5
2. ICE must halt enforcement 
activities. 
3. ICE must halt all transfers within 
the immigration detention 
system as well as all transfers 
from state and local jails and 
prisons.
4. ICE must adopt a moratorium on 
deportations in conjunction with 
the above recommendations.Recommendations—   Page 5   —
was far reaching and multilayered. 
People working at detention centers 
travel to and from their homes and 
communities, potentially introducing 
the virus both to people detained and 
to their communities. Multiple reports 
revealed that those working in ICE 
detention centers were not regularly 
wearing PPE. In addition, detained 
people were not given adequate access 
to soap or PPE.9 Further, ICE’s continued 
and irresponsible transfer of people 
throughout the detention system also 
facilitated the spread of the virus.10  As 
community transmission surged out 
of control in the spring and summer of 
2020, counties with detention facilities 
and surrounding counties endured 
higher rates of infection. Even as 
COVID-19 cases have surged across the 
country, ICE has ramped up enforcement 
activities,11 creating a recipe for disaster 
for those in detention and surrounding 
communities. 
This report adds to the body of research 
that points to ICE’s abuse and medical 
neglect of people in detention, and its 
failure to adequately respond to the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ICE’s 
failure to release people led to higher 
numbers of COVID-19 cases in counties 
where detention centers are located and 
the economic areas that surround them. Based on the findings of this report, ICE’s 
failure to release people from detention 
during the pandemic added over 
245,000 cases to the total U.S. caseload.    
ICE’s deadly detention 
system
ICE operates a sprawling network of 221 
dedicated and non-dedicated detention 
facilities throughout the U.S.12 This 
system has proven deadly to those it 
detains. More than 200 people have 
died in ICE custody since the creation of 
the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) in 2004. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, 
21 people died in ICE detention.13 Even 
excluding deaths due to COVID-19, FY 
2020 was the deadliest year for people 
detained by ICE since 2005.14 
People navigating their 
immigration cases should be 
able to do so with their loved 
ones and in community, not 
behind bars.—   Page 6   —
Detention Watch Network has previously 
documented the egregious conditions 
that typify immigration detention, 
including lack of access to basic hygienic 
products, inadequate food, abuse, and 
medical neglect.15 Public health officials 
have long warned infectious disease 
spreads rapidly through the system. 
In 2019, ICE had to place 5,200 people 
in quarantine — or about one in every 
10 detained people at the time — for 
exposure to mumps and chicken pox. 
Advocates attributed the outbreaks to 
inadequate medical care in a lawsuit 
against the agency.16ICE has repeatedly failed to 
appropriately respond to outbreaks of 
contagious diseases. In October 2018, 
the Texas Department of State Health 
Services reported five confirmed cases of 
mumps among immigrants transferred 
between two ICE detention centers. By 
August 2019, there were 898 reports of 
mumps cases in 57 facilities. According 
to the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), 84 percent of patients 
were exposed while in custody.17

COVID-19 in ICE detention 
facilities
Against this backdrop, it is no surprise 
that COVID-19 spread rapidly in the 
ICE detention system. Throughout the 
pandemic, ICE failed to provide adequate 
supplies of soap and PPE to people in 
detention and to detention center staff. 
Testing was inadequate and irregular. 
As of November 19, 2020, ICE has 
reported 7,339 positive cases among 
detained people out of a total of 62,080 
individuals who had been tested. To 
date, eight people in ICE detention have 
died of complications from COVID-19.18 
The number of those who have died due 
to COVID-19 contracted at ICE facilities 
may, in fact, be higher.  It is possible that 
a number of people contracted the virus 
in detention, were not tested, and then 
passed away after being released from 
detention or deported.
In at least one detention facility — the 
Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center 
in Bakersfield, California — ICE 
purposefully rejected universal testing 
because it would be too difficult to 
quarantine all detained people who 
may test positive.19 ICE has even 
been blamed for spreading the virus 
internationally by deporting people who were detained in facilities with active 
COVID-19 cases without testing them. 
People deported to countries including 
India, Haiti, Guatemala, and El Salvador 
tested positive shortly after their 
deportations.20  
At the Stewart Detention Center in 
Columbus, Georgia, three detained 
people have died and at least 379 have 
tested positive for the virus. Santiago 
Baten-Oxlaj, a 34-year-old Guatemalan 
immigrant, died in May. Mr. Baten-Oxlaj 
was detained for six weeks at Stewart 
and was infected with the virus during 
his detention.21 Weeks before his death, 
people detained at Stewart went on 
hunger strike demanding the most basic 
health precautions and advocacy groups 
demanded their release.22
In May, officials in Pearsall, Texas 
raised the alarm after every local case 
of COVID-19 could be traced back to 
ICE’s negligence at the South Texas 
ICE Processing Center. Local officials 
expressed concern that GEO Group, the 
company that operates the facility, failed 
to respond to emails or properly keep 
the community appraised as the virus 
quickly spread in the facility.23
In August, a federal judge ordered 
ICE to stop transferring people to the 
detention center in Farmville, Virginia —   Page 8   —
after 339 detained people tested positive 
for COVID-19. The judge commented 
that social distancing was not enforced 
and that many staff at the facility did 
not wear proper protective equipment, 
including masks.24
In October, the conditions devolved so 
badly at the nearly 2,000-bed Adelanto 
Detention Center in California that a 
federal judge ordered the administration 
to immediately begin releasing people 
from detention. More than 160 people 
in detention and 30 staff members were 
infected at the facility, even as ICE and 
GEO Group attempted to expand the 
facility.25
ICE’s failed response 
contributed to the spread 
of COVID-19 throughout the 
country
Our analysis explores how ICE’s failures 
contributed to the spread of COVID-19 
across the country, adding to the 
body of research documenting ICE’s 
mismanagement, grievous medical 
negligence, and lack of transparency.  
Key findings of the report include:1. Counties with ICE detention centers 
were more likely to report COVID-19 
cases earlier in the pandemic than 
counties without a detention center. 
Not only were counties with ICE 
facilities more likely to see an initial 
case in the spring of 2020, these 
counties were also more likely to 
confront a serious outbreak (at 
least 15 cases), a major outbreak 
(more than 250 cases) and a health 
care emergency (more than 2,500 
confirmed cases). 
2. The heightened risk was not limited 
to the county where an ICE detention 
facility was located. Nearby counties 
were also more likely to confront a 
serious COVID-19 outbreak in the 
spring of 2020. 
3. As the pandemic raged in the 
summer of 2020 (May – August), 
COVID-19 spread more rapidly in 
economic areas with ICE detention 
facilities. 
4. Larger ICE detention facilities 
contributed to accelerated growth in 
COVID-19 cases in nearby counties. 
Counties in economic areas with the 
largest immigrant detention centers 
added an estimated 150 COVID-19 
cases per 100,000 residents to 
baseline estimates. —   Page 9   —
5. Taken as a whole, the spread of 
COVID-19 due to ICE’s negligence was 
dramatic. Across the United States, 
the COVID-19 caseload surged over 
the summer of 2020. ICE exacerbated 
the pandemic. Between May and 
August, our analyses reveal that ICE 
detention facilities were responsible 
for over 245,000 COVID-19 cases 
throughout the country. These cases 
were concentrated in multicounty 
economic areas where ICE facilities 
are located.  
6. If a country had reported 245,000 
cases on August 1st to the World 
Health Organization, that country 
would have ranked 16th in the 
world, meaning that the number of 
COVID-19 cases attributed to spread 
caused by ICE detention in the 
United States would have outranked 
countries including Germany, France, 
and Canada.
7. California, Texas, and Arizona had 
the most net COVID-19 cases due 
to the presence of ICE detention 
facilities. Arizona had by far the most 
net additional COVID-19 cases per 
100,000 residents.Studying community 
transmission of COVID-19: 
Counties and multicounty 
economic areas
Because people commute, shop, and 
socialize across counties, for this 
study we examined the impacts of ICE 
detention for the county in which an 
ICE facility was located. Those who 
work in one county but live in another 
county are exposed to COVID-19 in more 
than one county. And, if they become 
infected, they can infect people in more 
than one county. For this reason, we also 
examined community transmission of 
COIVD-19 to nearby counties, specifically 
counties co-located in Bureau of 
Economic Analysis economic areas.26
Consider the Farmville Detention Center 
(FDC), located in Farmville, Virginia 
(Prince Edward County), approximately 
65 miles from Richmond. Including 
Prince Edward County, 39 counties are 
in the Richmond economic area. FDC 
experienced a severe outbreak during 
the summer of 2020, with more than 75 
percent of people detained there testing 
positive for COVID-19.27 In addition to 
raising concerns about the management 
of the facility, this high rate of infection —   Page 10   —

at FDC elevated the risk to residents of 
Farmville, residents of Prince Edward 
County, and those residing in nearby 
counties. In the following analyses, we 
include a measure to assess exposure to 
the county in which the facility is located, 
and we include a second measure that 
taps into exposure to counties in the 
larger economic area.
In analyses focused on the arrival of 
COVID-19 in the spring of 2020 (Figures 1 and 2 below), a simple contrast is 
presented – counties in the United 
States with one or zero immigrants 
in ICE detention versus counties with 
at least two people in ICE detention. 
Parallel to the county-specific measure, 
the multicounty measure contrasts 
counties in economic areas with 25 or 
fewer people in ICE detention to those in 
multicounty economic areas with more 
than 25 people in ICE detention.28
ADELANTO DETENTION CENTER  |  PHOTO CREDIT:  ALONSO YÁÑEZ, LA OPINION—   Page 12   —
In 2020, active ICE detention facilities 
were located in a minority of counties 
across the country. Among the 3,143 
counties included in these analyses, 
the vast majority (2,983 counties – 95 
percent) have no detention facility (0 or 
1 person detained). In the remaining 157 
counties (about 5 percent of all counties) 
ICE detained at least two people in Fiscal 
Year 2020. Among these 157 counties, 
the median number of people detained 
was 60. In other words, half of these 157 
counties had fewer than 60 people in 
detention; the other half had more than 
60 people in detention.  
However, when we zoomed out to 
consider economic areas, rather than 
individual counties alone, we found that 
more than two-thirds of counties in 
the U.S. (2,211 counties or 70 percent) 
are located in an economic area where 
ICE detention centers are present. 
Only 30 percent of counties (929) are 
in economic areas with zero people in 
ICE detention. A significant number of 
counties are in economic areas in which 
ICE detention is more prominent. Forty-
three percent of counties (or 1,345) had 
more than 25 people in ICE detention in 
their economic area. The median  
for these counties is 245 people in ICE 
detention across the economic area.Counties and multicounty 
economic areas with  
ICE facilities were more 
likely to confront  
serious COVID-19 
outbreaks 
When considering the role that ICE 
played in the spread of COVID-19, it 
is not enough to simply look at the 
presence of ICE facilities. A myriad 
of factors (other than ICE facilities) 
impacted the timing and severity of 
COVID-19 outbreaks.29 Our analyses 
consider the presence of an ICE facility in 
a county and in a multicounty economic 
area (25 or more people detained in the 
larger economic area).30
Using this approach, it is possible to 
hold constant a host of factors that 
might influence the timing of COVID-19 
arriving in a county and zero in on 
factors of concern. Logistic regression31 
was employed to evaluate the possibility 
that counties (Figure 1, next page) were 
at heightened risk of (a) COVID-19 being 
present in the county by April 1st (at 
least one case), (b) COVID-19 being 
present in the county by May 1st (more 
than 2 cases), (c) significant outbreak (15 Figure 1 is focused on five unwanted COVID-19 milestones:

cases) by May 1st, (d) serious outbreak 
(more than 250 cases by May 1st), and 
(e) a major outbreak (more than 2,500 
cases by May 1st). 
After holding all other variables constant 
(i.e., all other variables in the logistic 
regression model held at their respective 
means), presence of an ICE facility (more 
than one person detained) significantly 
increased a county’s risk of a COVID-19 
event.  Whereas 69% of counties 
were dealing with at least one case of 
COVID-19 by April 1st, an ICE detention 
facility made this 11% more likely (80%). 
A month later (May 1st), more than 2 
cases had been confirmed in 80% of 
counties without an ICE facility and in 
89% of counties with a facility. Similarly, 
whereas slightly more than half (53%) 
of counties without an ICE facility had confirmed more than 15 cases, counties 
with a facility were 7 points more likely 
to have done so (60%).  
ICE facilities also heightened the risk of 
more serious outbreaks:
• More than 250 cases (May 1): 13% of 
counties with 0 or 1 person detained, 
compared to 18% of counties with 2 
or more people detained.
• More than 2,500 cases (May 1): 
Few counties were dealing with an 
outbreak of this magnitude. But 
counties with ICE facilities (3.5%) 
were at significantly greater risk than 
counties without an ICE facility (2.3%).
Figure 1 reveals that the novel 
coronavirus does not respect the walls 
and fences surrounding ICE detention 
facilities. ICE employees, vendors, 
contractors, and visitors bring the virus 
with them as they travel to and from 
the facility where it can spread rapidly 
in congregate settings. Especially in 
the initial spread of the virus, residents 
of counties in which ICE facilities were 
located were more likely to report 
COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic 
and were at heightened risk of a serious 
outbreak. Nor does the virus respect 
county boundaries. As reported in 
Figure 2 (on page 16), the heightened The presence of an ICE 
facility significantly increased 
a county’s risk of a  
COVID-19 event.—   Page 15   —
risk attributable to ICE facilities extended 
to counties across multicounty economic 
areas. Figure 2 is also focused on 
unwanted COVID-19 events. Notably, 
our analyses provide evidence that that 
presence of an ICE facility did not make it 
more likely that a multicounty economic 
area reported COVID-19 cases early in 
the pandemic, only that the presence of 
an ICE facility made it more likely that 
the multicounty economic area faced a 
serious outbreak: 
• Presence:  
More than 15 cases (May 1)
• Significant outbreak:  
More than 100 cases (May 1)
• Serious outbreak:  
More than 250 cases (May 1)
• Major outbreak:  
More than 2,500 cases (May 1)
The contribution of ICE detention in 
multicounty economic areas to several 
COVID-19 events are displayed in Figure 
2 (next page).  
Figure 2 shifts the focus from the 
impact of ICE detention facilities in a 
county (Figure 1) to the impact of ICE 
detention facilities in nearby counties: 
more than 25 people detained across 
the multicounty BEA economic area. 
The focus continues to be on unwanted 
COVID-19 milestones:Presence (as of May 1st):
• More than 15 cases: The risk of 
having 15 or more cases increases 
by 5% -- 51% of counties with 25 
or fewer persons detained in the 
entire BEA area compared to 56% of 
counties in BEA area in which more 
people are detained. 
Larger outbreaks (as of May 1st):
• More than 100 cases: 21% of 
counties in BEA areas with fewer 
people detained reported 100 cases, 
compared to one-fourth (25%) of 
counties in a BEA area with more 
than 25 persons detained.
• More than 250 cases: For counties 
in a BEA area with more than 25 
persons detained, the risk of a major 
outbreak was over 14%. The risk was 
approximately 2% lower in BEA areas 
with fewer persons detained by ICE.
• More than 2,500 cases: Few counties 
were dealing with an outbreak of 
this magnitude. But counties in a 
BEA area with more than 25 persons 
detained were twice as likely to 
confront a major outbreak (3.0%) 
when compared to counties few 
persons detained by ICE (1.5%).  
When compared to Figure 2, the 
increased risk is higher for each —   Page 16   —

COVID-19 event in Figure 1. This should 
not be surprising. Figure 1 is comparing 
the 157 counties in which ICE detains 
2 or more people to nearly 3,000 
counties in which 0 or 1 person has been 
detained in 2020. In Figure 2, however, 
the comparison is between 1,345 
counties in multicounty economic areas 
with more than 25 people detained 
by ICE and counties in multicounty 
economic areas with lower levels of ICE 
detention. The increased prevalence of 
COVID-19 displayed in Figure 2 highlights 
the risks posed by ICE detention facilities 
across many more counties.
Figure 1 provides evidence that counties 
with ICE facilities were more likely to 
report cases of the novel coronavirus 
early on – and heightened risk of serious 
outbreaks as well. Figure 2 highlights the 
increased risk of serious outbreaks for 
counties near those with ICE facilities. Building on these analyses, the emphasis 
now shifts to the impact of ICE facilities 
as the COVID-19 pandemic spiraled out 
of control over the summer of 2020.
COVID-19 spread more 
rapidly in multicounty 
economic areas with ICE 
facilities
Building on the preceding analyses, we 
next considered the magnitude of the 
impact, i.e. the number of additional 
cases that could be attributed to the 
presence of an ICE facility. As is common 
in health research, the dependent 
variable is not the absolute number 
of cases. Instead, it is the number of 
COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents. 
Poisson regression was employed to 
estimate impacts on COVID-19 caseloads 
per 100,000 residents.32
We used the average daily population 
in ICE detention in a county and in the 
surrounding economic area to estimate 
the number of cases (per 100,000 
residents) that could be attributed 
to the presence of an ICE detention 
center in a county and the surrounding 
economic area. In order to focus on the 
relationship between the number of Counties near ICE facilities 
experienced an increased 
risk of a serious outbreak.—   Page 18   —

people detained by ICE and the spread 
of COVID-19, we included a range of 
control variables.33
The Poisson regression estimates did 
not provide evidence that ICE facilities 
contributed to growing caseloads of 
COVID-19 in the county in which they 
were located. However, providing 
additional evidence that the callous 
mismanagement of ICE facilities 
contributed to community spread, 
these analyses did provide evidence 
that as the size of ICE detention in the 
multicounty economic area increased, so 
did the incidence of COVID-19 (see  
Table 2).
Table 2 displays additional cases 
attributable to ICE facilities in the BEA 
economic area. The chart focuses on 
an “average” county, i.e., the mean 
was assumed for all variables in the 
Poisson regression model, except 
people detained by ICE in the BEA 
area. The “baseline” assumes no one 
(0) is detained by ICE in the BEA area: 
it is estimated that this “average” 
county confirmed 791 COVID-19 cases 
(per 100,000 residents) between May 
1st and August 1st.  Table 2 reports 
additional cases on top of this baseline 
as the number of people detained by 
ICE increases. Counties in economic 
areas with relatively few people in ICE detention do not diverge significantly 
from the baseline estimate. In fact, at 
the 50th percentile (5 persons detained 
in the BEA area), a county might 
expect a negligible increase (less than 
1 additional case per 100,000 on top 
of the baseline estimate). However, 
as the detained population increases 
so does the severity of the COVID-19 
outbreak. Counties in a BEA economic 
areas at the 75th percentile (131 people 
detained) were expected to confirm 
approximately 7 additional cases per 
100,000, and the caseload increased by 
39 per 100,000 residents for counties at 
the 90th percentile (5% increase). The 
situation was worse still for counties in 
BEA areas at the 95th percentile (1,376 
people detained): 70 additional cases 
per 100,000 residents. At the extreme 
(99th percentile, 2,959 or more people 
detained in the economic area), it is 
estimated that the number of additional 
cases was more than 150 cases (per 
100,000 residents) higher – i.e., a 20% 
increase in the COVID-19 caseload.   
Whereas Table 2 is concerned with 
cases per 100,000 residents, these 
results can also be used to estimate 
the net additional cases attributable to 
ICE detention for each county.34 Table

the strongest impact in the spread of 
COVID-19. 
Recall that the dependent measure 
in our estimation (as summarized in 
Table 2) is the number of additional 
cases per 100,000 residents (rightmost 
column in Table 3). Calculating net 
additional cases is based on the state’s 
total population and additional cases 
per 100,000. For each of the three top 
ranked states (California, Texas and 
Florida), net additional cases per 100,000 
residents exceeded 100.  However, if the rank in Table 3 was based on net 
additional cases per 100,000, Arizona 
would be first – and by a wide margin: 
its estimated 414.5 additional cases per 
100,000 is approximately 130 additional 
cases higher than the second highest 
(California with 284.6 additional cases 
per 100,000 residents).  
Adopting a similar approach, we also 
ranked economic areas (Table 4).

additional cases in a BEA area is based

on the total population and additional 
cases per 100,000. The Los Angeles area 
is both a major population center and 
experienced the highest impact from ICE 
detention activities (544 additional cases 
per 100,000 residents).  Consequently, 
the number of additional cases in the 
Los Angeles area exceeds 100,000 while 
the second highest impact (Phoenix) 
had an additional 27,549 cases due to 
ICE detention facilities. Each of the top 
six areas had an increased caseload 
that exceeded 10,000 cases, and the 17 
highest ranked areas had more than 
1,000 additional cases by August 1st.
Shifting the focus to additional cases 
per 100,000 residents (rightmost 
column in Table 4), only Los Angeles 
and Phoenix areas were hit by more 
than 500 additional cases. However, 
the comparable measure for Lafayette 
(Louisiana) exceeded 400 cases, and 
Miami, San Antonio, and McAllen (Texas) 
were left to cope with more than 250 
additional cases per 100,000 residents. 
Most of the areas listed in Table 4 had 
to come to terms with more than 100 
additional cases per 100,000 residents.
A national tragedy
Adopting the same approach that was 
used to estimate net additional cases in states (Table 3) and multicounty BEA 
economic areas (Table 4), we calculated 
the net effect of ICE detention for the 
entire United States. We estimate that 
ICE detention activities were linked to 
an additional 245,581 cases from May 
1st to August 1st. Because the United 
States’ management of COVID-19 is 
and has been a spectacular failure, this 
additional caseload may seem modest 
in comparison to the overall number 
of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. After all, 
by August 1st, the United States had 
confirmed nearly 4.5 million cases 
(and this is likely an undercount given 
the ongoing problems with testing). 
However, if ICE’s contribution to the 
COVID-19 pandemic is compared to 
national caseloads around the world, the 
impact of ICE’s poor management of the 
pandemic becomes readily apparent.

Net Additional Cases of COVID-19 Due to ICE Detention  (May 1- August 1) 
Compared to Countries with 100,000 or More Confirmed Cases
(as of August 1, 2020)37 —   Page 25   —
Table 5 (previous page) lists all countries 
with at least 100,000 confirmed cases 
as of August 1st – and inserts the cases 
attributable to ICE in this ranking. If the 
cases linked to ICE were the reported 
caseload of a country, that country 
would have ranked 16th in the world – 
nearly tied with Italy (the site of an early 
and severe outbreak). Equally disturbing 
is the monthly case rate among people 
detained by ICE. In a research letter 
published by the Journal of the American 
Medical Association (JAMA), Erfani, 
Uppal, and Lee35 calculated a monthly 
case rate of 6,683 as of August 2020. The 
rate of infection among people detained by ICE was more than 13 times higher 
than that of the general population. If a 
nation reported an infection rate of this 
magnitude to WHO, it would have the 
highest rate of infection in the world – 
and by a wide margin. 
The broader mismanagement of the 
pandemic helps explain the large 
number of cases linked to ICE facilities. 
Table 5 reports the cases per 100,000 
as of August 2020 (rightmost column). 
With nearly 1,588.7 cases per 100,000, 
the United States had one of the highest 
infection rates in the world (only Qatar 
[3,985] and Chile [2,008] were higher). 
FREE THEM ALL ACTION  |  PHOTO CREDIT: MARCELA HERNANDEZ—   Page 26   —
Among high-income countries, the 
infection rate in Spain is roughly half 
of the US rate; for the United Kingdom 
and Italy, the infection rate was less 
than a third.  For Canada and Germany, 
it was lower still. If the infection rate 
was comparable to Germany or Canada 
(roughly 20% of that found in the 
United States), it is quite possible that 
cases linked to ICE detention facilities 
would have been below 50,000. Neither 
Korea nor Japan are listed in Table 4 
because their total caseloads were well 
below 100,000 as of August (roughly 15,000 and 55,000 respectively). This 
translates into fewer than 50 cases per 
100,000 residents. Had the United States 
managed the pandemic comparably to 
these countries, there might have been 
fewer than 10,000 COVID-19 cases linked 
to ICE detention facilities. Instead, as of 
August 1st, due to the perverse synergy 
between these two policy failures, over 
245,000 cases can be traced back to ICE 
detention.
While ICE detention contributed to over 
245,000 COVID-19 cases in the US, and 
the presence of an ICE facility made 
a serious outbreak more likely, it is 
important to note that the people being 
detained by ICE bear no responsibility 
for this result. These 245,000 cases are 
the result of (uncontrolled) community 
transmission of COVID-19 – beyond 
the walls and fences of ICE facilities.  
Outside of the risk factors posed by their 
detention, people who are detained are 
no more or less likely to get sick than 
other people in the U.S. Rather detention 
centers, like other congregate settings, 
provide the perfect storm for the spread 
of a virus. ICE knew this and was warned 
about the consequences. Their failure 
to release people resulted in a spike in 
the infection rate in ICE facilities and in 
surrounding communities.  A research letter published by 
the Journal of the American 
Medical Association found 
that the rate of infection 
among people detained 
by ICE was more than 13 
times higher than that of the 
general population.—   Page 27   —
Conclusion and Recommendations
For years, the United States has ignored 
the advice of experts on immigration 
detention and has displayed a disregard 
for the dignity, safety, and health of 
people in detention. Time and again 
these chronic failures have been 
exemplified by a culture of abuse and 
medical neglect. These failures are 
endemic in the current system, but they 
are avoidable. Human rights abuses 
and medical neglect could be avoided if 
those navigating immigration cases were 
able to do so at home with their families 
and in their communities, not behind 
bars. Now during the ongoing global 
pandemic, these failures have created 
conditions for infection rates to soar. 
Medical professionals, advocates, and, 
most notably, detained immigrants 
themselves called on ICE to release 
people from detention as the COVID-19 
pandemic grew in early spring 2020, 
noting the unique vulnerability people 
face in detention. Meanwhile ICE 
continued enforcement operations 
and transfers between facilities, while 
people working in detention centers 
went back and forth from work and 
home in nearby communities, creating 
conditions for exposing the virus to 
people in detention, where it could spread quickly due to congregate 
settings. ICE refused to listen to these 
warnings. The failure to release people 
from custody in the spring and summer 
of 2020 – despite recommendations 
advanced by advocates and public health 
experts – proved to be catastrophic for 
people detained, for those working in 
detention centers, and for those living in 
surrounding communities.  
The failure to release 
people from custody 
proved to be catastrophic 
for people detained, for 
those working in detention 
centers, and for those 
living in surrounding 
communities.Our analysis demonstrates that 
counties with ICE facilities were more 
likely to report cases of COVID-19 
early on. The impact then rippled 
into the surrounding communities. 
Counties with ICE facilities and 
their surrounding multicounty 
economic areas were more likely to 
face a serious outbreak than those 
without ICE facilities. The spectacular 
mismanagement of COVID-19 
resulted in spiraling community 
transmission of the disease. Once 
introduced into ICE detention, 
COVID-19 transmitted quickly 
within facilities and the surrounding 
communities and counties (Table 
2). The consequences of this 
transmission were magnified many 
times over by the uncontrolled 
spread of COVID-19 in communities 
across the country.36
As COVID-19 cases are rising sharply 
and will continue to climb in the 
coming months, now is the time 
for immediate action to mitigate 
the spread of COVID-19 inside and 
outside the detention system. The immigration detention 
system is cruel and 
unnecessary. Its defects are 
only heightened during a global 
health crisis. People navigating 
their immigration cases should 
be able to do so with their loved 
ones and in community, not 
behind bars. 
The only just and long-term 
solution is to free all people 
from detention. 
In the meantime, 
1. ICE must immediately heed the 
advice of public health experts by 
significantly and quickly reducing the 
number of people in detention.38
2. ICE must halt enforcement activities. 
3. ICE must halt all transfers within the 
immigration detention system as 
well as all transfers from state and 
local jails and prisons.
4. ICE must adopt a moratorium on 
deportations in conjunction with 
above recommendations.—   Page 29   —

26 Kenneth P. Johnson and John R. Kort, “2004 
Redefinition of the BEA Economic Areas,” 
Survey of Current Business (November 2004), 
pages 68-75. The BEA examined linkages 
among counties, primarily on the basis of 
commuting patterns and media markets.  
Through this analysis, more than 3,100 
counties were sorted into 179 economic 
areas. The emphasis that BEA economic 
areas place on commuting is well suited for 
the purposes of this report.
