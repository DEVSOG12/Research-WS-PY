The United States has the largest immigration detention infrastructure in the world, with hundreds of 
thousands of people passing through detention each year. The large scope of the system is in part due 
to an arbitrary quota created by Congress in 20091 which, in its current version, requires Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to maintain a minimum of 34,000 detention beds at all times.2 This 
policy, known as the detention bed quota, is unprecedented; no other law enforcement agency oper-ates on a quota system for the number of people to incarcerate. It is also unethical and financially 
wasteful, costing American taxpayers over $2 billion a year
3 and separating hundreds of thousands of 
families.
In addition to the national quota, the immense size of the U.S.’s immigration detention system is 
bolstered by a series of local-level quotas, written into detention facility contracts as “guaranteed minimums.” Guaranteed minimums, which appear mostly in ICE contracts with private contractors 
(though some exist with local governments), guarantee that ICE will pay for a minimum number of 
people to be detained at any given time. Because the government seeks to avoid paying for detention space that isn’t being used,
4 guaranteed minimums are essentially local “lockup” quotas that influence 
ICE’s decision-making about immigration enforcement, whether or not people will be released, where 
people will be detained, and ultimately, who will profit or benefit from their detention.   
The first national snapshot of local lockup quotas throughout the immigration detention system was 
exposed in Banking on Detention: Local Lockup Quotas and the Immigrant Dragnet, published by 
Detention Watch Network (DWN) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) in June 2015.5 Since 
then, additional documents have become available which cast further light on local lockup quotas. 
First, these quotas are even more widespread than previously reported, covering at least 24 detention 
facility contracts. Second, while the overwhelming majority are found in ICE contracts with private companies, local lockup quotas do exist in a limited number of contracts with public entities. Third, 
these local lockup quotas exist in two of the three family detention center contracts. This report update 
aims to expose newly discovered guaranteed minimums, clarify the relationship between local lockup 
quotas and privatization, and explore in more depth the particular barriers to transparency that impede 
access to data and obscure the scope of the problem.
- 1 - Photo:  Steve Pavey- 2 -The additional guaranteed minimums included in this report come from documents obtained through 
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which allows the public to request access to records from 
federal agencies.6 The documents come from three sources: a subset of contracts recently obtained 
through FOIA litigation by the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC),7 a different subset of contracts 
ICE made available through its FOIA Library,8 and a spreadsheet obtained by the Transactional 
Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University through a FOIA request.9 While this 
report offers an updated tally of the number and location of guaranteed minimums across the country, the list likely remains incomplete because the document sets are incomplete, heavily redacted, and not 
always up to date. The scattered and incomplete nature of the information is the result of larger trans-parency failures detailed below. 
For this report update, as in the initial report, we conducted a comprehensive review of all available 
contracts to identify guaranteed minimums. These included contracts for the management of entire 
detention facilities, as well as contracts for detention-related services such as security services or transportation. In some cases, the number of people included in the guaranteed minimum was visible; 
in others we were able to calculate the number using other available data; and in the remaining cases 
there is still uncertainty about how many detained people have been promised to the subcontractor. We have included in our analysis all facilities for which we found a guaranteed minimum, and have 
noted those for which we are uncertain about the number.Methodology
T aken from ICEʼs Broward Transitional
Center contract with The GEO Group.Guaranteed minimums require ICE to pay contractors for a minimum number of detention beds 
regardless of how many people are detained. This means that contractors receive a set payment for a 
minimum number of detention beds even if some of the detention beds are empty. Because ICE does 
not want to appear wasteful or inefficient with the number of beds it must pay for, these contractual provisions create an incentive to detain as many people as possible in facilities with guaranteed mini-
mums. These guaranteed minimums essentially function as a local lockup quota. Through this 
perverse incentive, guaranteed minimums act as a mechanism through which other entities—mostly 
private prison companies—influence ICE’s decisions regarding how many people are detained, where 
they are detained, and how long they are kept in detention. 
When Banking on Detention was initially published in 2015, available information indicated that local 
lockup quotas existed exclusively in contracts with private entities that either operated detention facilities or provided detention-related services. New information reveals that there are a small number 
of guaranteed minimums in public contracts as well. This indicates that guaranteed minimums are a 
more common contracting mechanism than previously thought. However, while this report update reveals four guaranteed minimums in public contracts, they represent only a small fraction of the total 
known guaranteed minimums and do not lessen the concern that private companies influence ICE’s 
practices. Guaranteed minimums or local lockup quotas account for at least 12,821 of the 34,000 
beds funded by the detention bed quota. Of these 12,821, 93 percent, or 11,936, exist in facilities that 
contract with private companies.
In addition to the fifteen guaranteed-minimum facilities exposed in Banking on Detention, this report 
documents an additional nine contracts with guaranteed minimums. These include Berks Family Residential Center, Calhoun County Correctional Center and the Dearborn Police Department (which 
have a joint contract and thus a shared guaranteed minimum), California City Correctional Facility, 
Essex County Correctional Facility, Farmville Detention Center, T. Don Hutto Residential Center, Imperi-al Regional Detention Facility, Mesa Verde Detention Facility, and Monroe County Detention Center. All 
nine contracts are intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs); of the nine, five facilities have sub-
contracts with private companies. 
Additionally, this report confirms the existence of local lockup quotas for families—at the Karnes 
County Residential Center in Texas and the Berks Family Residential Center in Pennsylvania. The local 
quota at Berks is an entirely new discovery, and it stands out as one of the four guaranteed minimums found in public contracts where no private subcontractor is implicated. The presence of a local quota 
at Karnes was noted in the original publication of Banking on Detention, but it was unclear whether the 
local quota remained operative after the facility was converted from an all-male facility to a family 
detention center in 2014. However, through the review of a newly-available 2015 contract, we can now 
confirm the continuation of the guaranteed minimum. Thus, at least one private company, The GEO Group, Inc. (GEO), is benefiting from a local lockup quota to detain mothers and children.

tions Corporation of America (CCA), Immigration Centers of America (ICA), and Management and

private company.  Local Lockup Quotas

*  The map is divided by color into ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field office jurisdictions.- 6 -The findings presented in Banking on Detention and this update provide only a partial understanding of 
the scope and impact of guaranteed minimums. Due to ICE’s lack of transparency and the resulting 
unavailability of data, it is currently unclear what percentage of detention facilities are subject to guar-
anteed minimums, what the costs of guaranteed minimums are, and the degree to which they influ-ence ICE’s practices in controlling the pipeline into and out of detention. By obstructing access to its 
contracts, ICE leaves the public with an incomplete understanding of how pervasive and harmful 
guaranteed minimums truly are.
ICE demonstrates a lack of transparency at multiple levels, beginning with its failure to proactively 
disclose contract information for detention facilities and services. The main avenue to information on 
guaranteed minimums—and on detention contracts more generally—is through FOIA requests, which 
can be costly and time-consuming both to the parties filing the requests and to the agency, in this case ICE, which must process and respond to the requests. Another way to access contract
information is through FedBizOpps, the federal website that publishes contract solicitations,
38 which 
provides the best available information for facilities whose contracts are redacted or otherwise inac-cessible through ICE. To date, nearly all data on guaranteed minimums have been obtained through 
FOIA requests.
39
When individuals or organizations do attempt to access information through FOIA requests, ICE resists transparency by delaying its responses and then redacting most of the critical information from its 
documents.
40 In November 2013, DWN and CCR filed a FOIA request for access to information 
pertaining to the national detention bed quota. ICE did not comply with this request until it was required to do so by court order in July 2014, over seven months later.
41 When ICE finally released 
documents in response to the FOIA request, figures on government-contracted unit prices, bed-day rates, and staffing plans were redacted.  This redacted information, if disclosed, would clarify the cost 
of detention in each facility and allow the public to better understand the fiscal and human impact of detention quotas, including guaranteed minimums. Instead, ICE claims that such information consti-
tutes “confidential or privileged information” that would cause substantial competitive harm to private 
contractors if released to the public.
42  
As of June 2016, the appropriateness of ICE’s redactions is still pending in the federal district court for 
the Southern District of New York. Notably, ICE’s legal position depends heavily on support from private contractors themselves, who have submitted sworn declarations attesting to the need for 
keeping the terms of government contracts secret. In the case of GEO, one of the largest private 
prison contractors in the country, the support comes from a former ICE official, David Venturella, who 
is now the Senior Vice President of Business Development at GEO.
43 In December 2015, Venturella 
submitted a declaration on behalf of GEO defending ICE’s decision to withhold information from its FOIA document releases.
44 This relationship between ICE and its private contractors attests to the Absence of Transparency
By obstructing access to its contracts, ICE leaves the public with an incomplete 
understanding of how pervasive and harmful guaranteed minimums truly are. “
“T. Don Hutto Residential Center
- 7 -enormous influence that private prison companies have, not only on detention operations, but on 
government transparency itself. The more the detention system relies on private corporations, the less 
transparent it is. This is all the more reason to be concerned about the growing privatization of deten-
tion, which now accounts for roughly 62 percent of beds.45
ICE’s lack of transparency is especially troubling when looking at local quotas. To date, the majority of guaranteed minimums have been found in private contracts, either with privately-operated detention 
facilities or publicly-operated jails that subcontract to private companies for detention services, such 
as guard services or facility operations and maintenance support.
46 Given that ICE is contractually 
obligated to pay for guaranteed minimums regardless of how many detention beds are filled, ICE has 
an incentive to detain as many people as possible in privately-operated detention facilities. In addition 
to the guaranteed minimum, to maximize efficiency, ICE takes advantage of “tiered pricing” where available, which provides a discount to ICE for immigrants detained above the guaranteed minimum 
amount.
47 This results in ICE potentially changing its practices to satisfy the guaranteed minimum in 
each facility, essentially helping private contractors secure profits. As discussed in Banking onDetention, communications released by ICE through FOIA litigation indicate that officials make
significant efforts to steer immigrants to facilities with guaranteed minimums.
48 
Guaranteed minimums thus subject detention and placement decisions—which have enormous human impact on individuals detained, as well as their families and communities—to cost consider-ations that benefit private contractors. Without transparency and accountability, we cannot determine 
the full extent of guaranteed minimums and the degree to which private prison companies influence 
ICE and benefit from detention policies. However, by failing to disclose contracts and resisting 
attempts to access information, ICE demonstrates that it is more accountable to private prison com-
panies than to the public, whose tax dollars fund the guaranteed minimums. 
Photo: Cristina Parker- 8 -Immigration detention places people in inhumane and sometimes even fatal conditions. In February 
2016, DWN collaborated with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Immigrant 
Justice Center (NIJC) to publish Fatal Neglect: How ICE Ignores Deaths in Detention, a report exposing 
medically negligent deaths in ICE custody. Of the eight deaths discussed in the report, five occurred at detention facilities known to have guaranteed minimums.
49 These deaths, and the corresponding 
negligence at the facilities where detained people died, have had no impact on the advantages that 
private companies enjoy from guaranteed minimums. With guaranteed minimums incentivizing ICE to 
pursue more aggressive enforcement and create barriers to people’s release from detention, the end result is an inhumane, quota-based immigration detention system that functions as taxpayer-funded 
profit insurance for private prison companies.
Since the release of Banking on Detention, Representative Ted Deutch (D-FL) and eight additional 
co-sponsors introduced the Protecting Taxpayers and Communities from Local Detention Quotas Act,
50  
which would prevent ICE from participating in any legal agreement that mandated a bed quota at the 
local level. In addition to the representatives’ statements on the quotas being “inhumane,” Representative 
Deutch stated that by eliminating the national bed quota, “Congress could save taxpayers nearly $15 billion over the next decade.”
51  Because ICE spends over $2 billion each year on detention, the elimi-
nation of national and local quotas, with a corresponding decrease in detention, could save significant 
tax dollars and prevent immeasurable human suffering.52
There is a growing consensus that the mass detention of immigrants is unnecessary and inhumane. 
The U.S. government should move towards ending the use of immigration detention altogether. Unfor-
tunately, corporate interests and the absence of job growth for the constituents of many local govern-
ments that contract with ICE have converted the detention of human beings into a market-based activity. Detention capacity and arbitrary quotas must never be a factor in making decisions regarding 
immigration enforcement. 
As immediate next steps, this report reiterates many of the recommendations from Banking on Deten-
tion and calls on:
• ICE to remove guaranteed minimums, tiered pricing, or any other provisions that could
 function as a local lockup quota, from all detention contracts.
• ICE to make all information pertaining to detention contracts and the bidding process publicly 
 accessible and transparent. 
• ICE to stop contracting with private companies that lobby to pervert public policy via
 guaranteed minimums and other contractual giveaways.• ICE to bar (1) the transfer of individuals between detention facilities; (2) the manipulation of 
 bond or parole determinations; and (3) the initiation of enforcement actions based in whole or
 in part on empty detention beds, unmet guaranteed minimums, or tiered pricing.• Congress to remove the national detention bed quota from the FY 2017 Department of
 Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations bill.
• Congress to pass the Protecting Taxpayers and Communities from Local Detention Quotas  Act, which would prevent ICE from participating in any legal agreement that mandated a bed 
 quota at a local level.Conclusion- 9 -1.  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2010 (October 28, 2009). Government Printing Office.
