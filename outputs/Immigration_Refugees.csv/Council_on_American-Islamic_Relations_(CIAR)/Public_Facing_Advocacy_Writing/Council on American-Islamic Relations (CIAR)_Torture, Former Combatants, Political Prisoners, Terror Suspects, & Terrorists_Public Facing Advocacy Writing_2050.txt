For a time, he even provided technical support to military aircraft destined for combat. Who could have guessed that such a man would be deemed too dangerous to board commercial aircraft?But that is what the FBI has done to Saadiq. Earlier this month, the FBI prevented him from boarding his flight from Oklahoma to Qatar where he lives with his wife and daughter. Last year, the FBI twice prevented Saadiq from flying to Oklahoma from Qatar to visit his gravely ill mother.It was only after a flurry of media attention, a petition with thousands of signatures and the intervention of Department of Justice officials that the FBI relented. Saadiq finally flew home to Oklahoma in November, just in time to spend what may be the final Thanksgiving he shares with his sick mother.But his return to Oklahoma only marked the beginning of a campaign of FBI harassment. Unmarked vehicles followed him. FBI agents approached family in intimidating fashion. On one occasion, the FBI misled local authorities into believing that Saadiq and his sister were felons evading arrest, which they are not. Predictably, this last episode caused Saadiq and his sister to be yanked from their vehicle at gunpoint, handcuffed and tossed to the ground.After all of this, Saadiq wants only to go home to be with his wife and daughter. But he cannot, because the FBI won’t let him board a plane to get there.This can’t be because the FBI thinks Saadiq is much of a danger. For one, Saadiq flew into the United States less than three months ago. He wasn’t dangerous then. He isn’t dangerous now. In fact, Saadiq sent the FBI a letter in advance of his most recent flight informing the agency of his itinerary, not exactly the approach of a would-be terrorist. Additionally, while Saadiq can’t fly, he can still ride buses and trains, travel across bridges and go to the mall. He does these things without the FBI’s intervention because none is needed: Saadiq is peaceful and law-abiding.What’s most alarming about Saadiq’s ordeal is that the FBI will never have to explain its actions. When it comes to separating Saadiq ”” and many others ”” from family via its ever-growing and always secret watch lists, the FBI is judge, jury and executioner. Saadiq hasn’t been indicted, charged or convicted of any crime. And yet the FBI has claimed for itself the power to impose permanent punishment upon Saadiq: life without air travel.If FBI agents can impose this sentence on Saadiq, they can do the same to any of us. For Saadiq’s sake and our own, let’s demand that the FBI cease preventing Saadiq from traveling to his family.TrendingAlmost 100 Community Members Take Part in 5th Annual Pennsylvania Muslim Capitol Day in HarrisburgOctober 26, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-OK, Community Partners Host Candidate Open HouseOctober 26, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Condemns Racist Vandalism at Iowa CollegeOctober 26, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Resignation of North Carolina Sheriff Over Racist CommentsOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR, Jetpac Release First National Directory of Local, State and Federal Elected Muslim Officials and JudgesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesVideo: CAIR-MN Director Jaylani Hussein Responds to Fargo Muslim Cemetery VandalismOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-LA Condemns Antisemitic Statements Made by Kanye West and the Disgusting Show of Support From Neo-Nazis in Los AngelesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesMaryland Community to Call on Montgomery County Council to Reject Disputed IHRA Definition of Antisemitism and Anti-Palestinian RacismOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Calls EU Court Ruling Allowing Hijab Bans in the Workplace a Setback for Religious FreedomOctober 24, 2022Press Releases‘American Muslim of the Year’ Award to Go to Ohio Student Athlete Noor Abukaram at 28th Annual CAIR BanquetOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-Pennsylvania to Join Emgage, Members of Muslim Community at 5th Annual Muslim Capitol DayOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesVideo: CAIR-MN Calls for Hate Crime Probe into Fargo Muslim Cemetery VandalismOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesBREAKING: CAIR-MN Calls for Probe of Possible Bias Motive for Vandalism Targeting North Dakota Muslim CemeteryOctober 22, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-AZ Condemns Distribution of Antisemitic Flyers in TempeOctober 22, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Sentencing of Mississippi Man Who Threatened to Wage a Race WarOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR, Jetpac to Release First National Directory of Local, State and Federal Elected Muslim Officials and Judges, Embargoed Copies Available to MediaOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesAction Alert: Join Interfaith Advocates, Activists in Urging Montgomery County Council to Reject Resolution That Endangers Free Speech, Palestinian Human RightsOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-Houston Calls Texas Secretary of State’s Statement an ‘Obvious Attempt at Voter Suppression,’ Encourages Community Members to VoteOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Hate Crime Charges for Wisconsin Anti-Immigrant IncidentOctober 20, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-OK, Community Partners to Host First Candidate Open HouseOctober 20, 2022Press ReleasesContact info453 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20003Tel: (202) 488-8787Fax: (202) 488-0833www.cair.comMore contact infoAbout UsVision, Mission, Core PrinciplesCAIR at a GlanceCAIR: Who We AreNational Board of DirectorsDepartment DirectorsAnnual Reports and FinancialsEndorsements, Awards, RecognitionsCAIR ChaptersDispelling Rumors About CAIRWorking with Law EnforcementNews & MediaMedia ContactsPress ReleasesOp-edsBookable SpeakersVideosMedia ResearchCAIR LogosPhotosGet involvedCareersInternVolunteerEventsBecome an AllyUse Your VoiceResourcesKnow Your RightsCivil Rights ReportsWays to GiveGuides and toolkitsGuides to Muslim Religious PracticesBook a CAIR WorkshopRequest a SpeakerRegister to VoteGovernment Affairs ReportsTake ActionReport an incidentAction AlertsScroll to TopPrivacy PolicyLegalVolunteerJoin our Email ListEventsContact UsFacebook-fTwitterInstagramYoutube© 2022 Council on American-Islamic Relations.Website designed by INTELLIPLANS
