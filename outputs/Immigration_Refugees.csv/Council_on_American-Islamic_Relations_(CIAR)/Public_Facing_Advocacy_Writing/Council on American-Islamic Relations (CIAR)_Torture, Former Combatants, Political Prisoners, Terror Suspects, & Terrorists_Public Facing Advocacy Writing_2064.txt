Segregating prisoners by race, national origin, or language violates the Supreme Court’s February 2005 decision in Johnson v. California that affirmed 14th Amendment protection against racial discrimination. Specifically, the Court:“rejected the notion that separate can ever be equal-or ‘neutral’ – 50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education (this Court repudiated it and) refuses to resurrect it today.”US Prison Bureau regulations also stipulate that “staff shall not discriminate against inmates on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, disability, or political belief (including) administrative decisions (involving) access to work, housing and programs.” Nonetheless, the Bush administration instituted these practices, and they continue under Barack Obama at the Terre Haute federal prison’s Communications Management Unit (CMU). Perhaps at other federal and state facilities as well at a time Muslims are vilified and persecuted.September 11, 2001 events unleashed a torrent of fear, repression, and a war on Islam, henceforth targeting innocent Muslims as terrorists, Islamofascists, and criminals for their faith, ethnicity, prominence, and/or charity.Ever since, numerous innocent men and some women have suffered grievously. Besides “unlawful enemy combatants” in global “torture prisons,” they’ve been unfairly harassed, arrested, prosecuted, and interned as political prisoners for being Muslims at the wrong time in America. Most end up in federal facilities like the CMU at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), Terre Haute, Indiana, established to segregate and discriminate against Muslims and Middle Eastern internees.
