Cultural Survival envisions a future that respects and honors Indigenous Peoples' inherent rights and dynamic cultures, deeply and richly interwoven in lands, languages, spiritual traditions, and artistic expression, rooted in self-determination and self-governance.Our ProgramsCommunity MediaOur Community Media Program provides important grants and support to a network of Indigenous community radio stations around the globe and develops critically needed programming to assure freedom of expression. In 2018, 33 media projects were funded in nine countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Nepal, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, Panama), totaling $210,000. 60+ Indigenous women received training in radio production and journalism.Community Media Youth FellowshipThe Indigenous Community Media Youth Fellowship supported 6 youth from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and Ecuador in building capacity in media, journalism, radio production, advocacy skills, technical abilities, and regional networking.Women's WorkshopsOur Community Media Program continued our series of training workshops for women in Central America that aims to develop Indigenous women leaders and support their development of gender equity-driven radio programming at Indigenous community radio stations. During 2018, a series of three workshops supported the capacity of 40 Indigenous women radio communicators, with an emphasis on the principle of Chacha-Warmi (an Andean Indigenous perspective of harmony between men and women, and the recognition of duality in nature and in human beings) or what to the Western world is known as gender equity. Workshops were held in Antigua, Guatemala from November 6-10, Chiapas, Mexico from November 14-16, and Oaxaca, Mexico from November 28-December 1.Environmental ConveningOur second environmental convening “Respecting Our Science and Ways of Knowing: Indigenous Peoples’ Food Sovereignty, Traditional Lifeways, and Climate Change” was held in Ixtlán, Oaxaca, Mexico on August 24-26. Sixty-eight participants comprised of Indigenous community members, scientists, academics, students, elders, and youth discussed topics such as Indigenous traditional knowledge, understandings and perspectives of climate change, and the issues Indigenous communities face resulting from the rapid pace of anthropocentric climate change and the impact on food sovereignty.Keepers of the Earth FundThe Keepers of the Earth Fund is a small grants fund designed to support Indigenous Peoples’ community advocacy and development projects to claim self-determination and Free, Prior and Informed Consent. In 2018, we awarded 12 grants in nine countries (Nepal, Brazil, Kenya, Honduras, Ecuador, Mexico, USA, Panama, Belize), totaling $58,895.“The term Keepers of the Earth is very well put, because our community, with the support of Cultural Survival, has been able to reinforce this way of seeing the world. Through this project, it is my job to follow through with my role as an Earth Guardian. Cultural Survival is one of the few organizations that we know of which enables us to go ahead, and do what we want to do, the way we want to do it. That is very important."–Oswaldo Martinez, Fundacion de Santa Maria para la Promocion Indigena y Agroforestal, México, Keepers of the Earth Grant PartnerAdvocacy ProgramOur Advocacy Program brings international attention to places where governments and corporations have violated Indigenous rights.In 2018, Cultural Survival submitted 21 stakeholder reports to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and UN Treaty Bodies on human rights issues affecting Indigenous communities in 15 countries (Cameroon, Mexico, Nepal, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Belize, Chile, China, Malaysia, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia.We provided advocacy accompaniment to three grantee partner organizations from Brazil, Belize, and Ecuador participating in the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples Issues in New York, including logistics coordination, planning and scheduling of meetings with country missions, drafting Interventions, media support including photography, video, and audio.  We hosted/ co-hosted five side events that were well-attended by forum attendees. We also held four live-broadcast panel sessions at the new "Indigenous Media Zone" that were watched by thousands of viewers on social media.CS staff and our grantee partners held eight meetings with UN Country Missions to advocate on issues like Freedom of Expression in Latin America, Land Rights in Belize, and the effects of industrial soy farming in Brazil's Amazon, which will lead to follow up within the UPR process.Our advocacy also has impacts locally: together with local partners, we carried out the first ever public celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day in the city where Cultural Survival was founded, Cambridge, MA, inviting Lakota hip hop artist Frank Waln to perform a free concert.Indigenous Rights RadioOur Indigenous Rights Radio Program shares the latest information on Indigenous Peoples' rights and how they are being implemented around the world in English, Spanish and Indigenous languages. In 2018, we released over 196 programs in 81 countries to 1,733 stations on Indigenous rights topics, such as the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent, Indigenous women’s rights, food sovereignty, and Sustainable Development Goals.Cultural Survival BazaarsSince 1975, Cultural Survival Bazaars have provided a market for thousands of Indigenous artists and cooperatives spanning six continents and over sixty countries. In 2018, the Bazaars hosted over 50 artists and generated over $493,358 for Indigenous artists and communities, supporting their right to practice cultural traditions and customs and develop their cultural heritage.Indigenous Artisan InstituteThe 2018 Indigenous Artisan Institute brought together 15 Indigenous artists from India, Nepal, Uzbekistan, Peru, Mexico, Burkina Faso, and Madagascar to showcase their skills and mastery, build relationships, and exchange skills.Audited Financials for 2018Volunteers, Interns and Consultants:Salma Al-Sulaiman, Tobias Berblinger, Josamine Bronnvik, Jenna Brooks, Jackie Chen, Megan Davis, Leah Gage, Brooke Gilder, Francesca Glaspell, Megan Heidel, Emma Himmelberger, Evan Klasky, Tracy Lai, Diego Lopez, Kimberly Maida, Aine McAlinden, Toni Monge, Allen Perez, Nathasha Perlmutter, María Reyes García, Madeline StreileinBoard of DirectorsDuane Champagne (Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa),  PresidentSteven Heim,  Vice-PresidentJason Campbell (Spokane),  TreasurerNicole Friederichs, ClerkEvelyn Arce EricksonKaimana Barcarse (Native Hawaiian)Jason Campbell (Spokane)Laura GrahamJean JacksonAjb’ee Jiménez (Mam Maya)Lesley Kabotie (Crow)John KingStephen MarksTui Shortland (Māori)Stella Tamang (Tamang)Staff MembersSuzanne Benally (Navajo and Santa Clara Tewa), Executive Director *Mark Camp, Deputy Executive DirectorMaria Eugenia "Maru" Chavez, Indigenous Rights Radio Program Manager *Jessie Cherofsky, Bazaar Program ManagerAvexnim Cojti (Maya K’iche’), Community Media Program ManagerDanielle DeLuca, Advocacy Program ManagerShaldon Ferris (Khoisan), Indigenous Rights Radio ProducerSofia Flynn, Accounting & Office ManagerNati Garcia (Maya Mam), Indigenous Youth Community Media Fellowship CoordinatorCesar Gomez (Pocomam), Community Media Program CoordinatorBia’ni Madsa’ Juárez López (Mixe/Zapotec), Keepers of the Earth Fund Project ManagerDev Kumar Sunuwar (Kumar/ Sunuwar), Program Associate, Community Media Grants ProjectMaría del Rosario ‘Rosy’ Sul González (Kakchiquel Maya), Radio ProducerDanae Laura, Bazaar Program ManagerJamie Malcolm-Brown, Communications & Information Technology ManagerTeresita Orozco Mendoza, Community Media Program CoordinatorKatharine Norris, Program Assistant *Diana Pastor (Maya K'iche'), Program AssistantAgnes Portalewska, Communications ManagerMelissa Stevens, Director of Philanthropic Partnerships *Jackie Tiller (Tlingit) Keepers of the Earth Fund Project Manager *Socrates Vasquez (Ayuuk), Community Media Grants CoordinatorMiranda Vitello, Development Associate* staff members no longer on staffPARTNERS IN CHANGE:Thank you to our Partners In ChangeOur work would not be possible without your generous support.Donors and Foundations$500-$999American Endowment FoundationAnonymousMark BaranowskiStephan and Judy BeyerNancy BonvillainKen BrickerCarolyn BrownLouise M.
