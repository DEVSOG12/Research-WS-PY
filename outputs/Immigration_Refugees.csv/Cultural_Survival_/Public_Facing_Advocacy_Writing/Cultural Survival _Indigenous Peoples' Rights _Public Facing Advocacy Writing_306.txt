Stereotypical Native American mascots have been shown to interfere with a school’s efforts to provide accurate information related to the history, culture, and Tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations.The American Psychological Association’s 2005 resolution states, “The continued use of American Indian mascots, symbols, images, and personalities establishes an unwelcome and often times hostile learning environment that affirms negative images and stereotypes that are promoted in mainstream society.”   As well, research conducted by Stephanie A. Fryberg (2008) concluded:• Exposure to race-based Indian stereotypes harms American Indian students,• Attractive stereotypes cause as much harm as cartoon caricatures,• American Indian students who approve the use of Indian logos, mascots and names experience more harm than do American Indian students who oppose the use of such imagery.• Euro-Americans experience a boost of self-esteem when exposed to the same-race based Indian stereotypes.We urge you to continue holding Massachusetts to the highest standards for our children’s public education and to ensure that all of our children feel welcome in our schools.Cultural SurvivalRelated ArticlesAdvance the Massachusetts Indigenous Legislative Agenda!Sep 30, 2021Sacheen Remembered: Personal ReflectionsOct 03, 2022Meet Our 2022-2023 Writers in ResidenceOct 21, 20222067 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA 02140(617) 441-5400Cultural Survival, Inc. is a non-profit organization with federal 501(c)(3) status.
