The day became recognized in 2017 when Montana Senators Steve Daines and Jon Tester responded to the murder of Hanna Harris on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, as well as the cumulation of other murders and abductions of Native women and girls. Since then, grassroots efforts at local, regional, national, and international levels have grown as Indigenous families, advocates, and Indigenous nations continue to call attention to the violence and galvanize action in response to the MMIWG crisis.We encourage you to join community actions this week to raise awareness and call on governments to be accountable to the injustices and systemic barriers embedded in federal and local legislation that perpetuate this crisis. As Hanna Harris’s mother, Malinda Limberhand, aptly said: “As a mother, nothing will replace the loss of my daughter, but by organizing to support the National Day of Awareness and creating the changes needed, I know it will help others. And Hanna and so many others will not be forgotten.”7 Actions to Take for National Day of Awareness for #MMIWG1.
