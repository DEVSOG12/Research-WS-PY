IJPC educates and advocates for immigrants’ rights and creates opportunities for the community to hear their unique voices as we work for comprehensive immigration reform.Our Position:IJPCfully believes that immigrants are to be welcomed to the United States and that U.S. law needs to provide a path for our undocumented neighbors to gain legal status. Immigrant individuals and families must be given opportunities for integration into U.S. society and protected from exploitation. Furthermore, IJPC realizes that people do not make the decision to leave their homeland lightly. Nations need to work together to create a just international economic structure in which every person’s human rights are respected and provides dignified work within each country. We believe that national security is not enhanced by threats of mass deportation, detention of undocumented individuals and families, or by vast increases in border surveillance.Our Work:The goal of IJPC’s immigration program is to engage immigrants, allies, and the general public on the realities of our broken immigration system so that they can come together and advocate for comprehensive immigration reform.IJPC’s Youth Educating Society (YES) program empowers immigrant youth and allies, through support and education, to cultivate social and legislative change for a more inclusive and just society. Through monthly meetings, leadership training, direct action organizing campaigns and sharing their stories, IJPC’s YES leaders are using their voices to demand change in Cincinnati and beyond.IJPC offers interactive, dynamic group presentations to explain how the immigration system works and doesn’t work. There are three main presentations we offer, all of which can be tailored to the request: Immigration 101, DACA and Dream Act Presentation, and our YES Speakers Bureau.To request a presentation or speaker, please fill out this form.IJPC collaborates with many partners to coordinate the Immigrant Dignity Coalition. The Immigrant Dignity Coalition’s membership represents local labor, education, civil rights and faith communities in the greater Cincinnati area who favor the dignity and basic human rights of all people. The Immigrant Dignity Coalition’s purpose is to inform, connect, and mobilize the Southwest Ohio / Northern Kentucky community to defend and protect the dignity of the immigrant and refugee community by working in partnership and as allies.Get Involved:Keep learning and stay connected to ongoing efforts:Organize or arrange a speaker from IJPC.Sign up for immigration specific emails from IJPC.Receive the Immigrant Dignity Report in your inbox twice a month: contact immigrantdignitycoalition@gmail.com.Follow IJPC, YES and the Immigrant Dignity Coalition on social media.Plug in and show up:Check IJPC’s website and Facebook page for the latest meetings and events.Volunteer to be an interpreter during meetings or translate documents (English-Spanish): contact samantha@IJPCcincinnati.org if interested.Attend the monthly Immigrant Dignity Coalition meeting to learn about more volunteer needs in the community.Take action:Submit a Comment to Save DACA (Nov 2021)The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule on the DACA program fails to meet the urgency of this moment. The current proposed rule leaves open the possibility of removing work permits for hundreds of thousands of immigrant youth who rely on steady employment to provide for themselves and their families. Go to https://comment.homeishere.us/ to submit a comment to save DACA. Public comments are most effective when they’re unique. Before submitting your comment, add 2-3 sentences to the beginning about why you care about DACA.Resources:The following resources were researched and compiled as part of IJPC’s previous educational presentations.
