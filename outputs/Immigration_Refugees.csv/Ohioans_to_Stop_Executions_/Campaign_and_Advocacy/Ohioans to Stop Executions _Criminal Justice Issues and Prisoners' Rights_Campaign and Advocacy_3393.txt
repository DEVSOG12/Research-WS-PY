None of the 38 executions during this time involved a white defendant who killed a black victim.At least seven black defendants have been executed for murdering a white victim.More than 70% of the people on Ohio’s death row are there for the murder of a white person, even though more than half of all homicide victims are black.Of the 138 inmates on death row in Ohio, more than half are people of color, even though they make up a very small fraction (16%) of Ohio’s population.Race impacts death sentencing at every stage of the death penalty process, often in ways that are hidden or unintentional. Cross-racial eyewitness identification, for example, is much less reliable than eyewitness identification from within the same race or ethnicity. White jurors are less likely to be receptive to mitigating evidence when the defendant is black, and more likely to find future dangerousnessThe Joint Task Force to Review the Administration of Ohio’s Death Penalty made several recommendations attempting to address the clear racial bias, including the adoption of a Racial Justice Act. The act allows defendants facing the death penalty to present evidence of racial bias, including statistics, in court.Copyright © 2022 · undesign on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in
