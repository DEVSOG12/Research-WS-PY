Vinton County’s entire court system was shut down for three weeks during the death penalty trial of Gregory McKnight.In April 2019, the Ohio House passed a piece of legislation to grant financial assistance to Pike County to seek death sentences for those involved with the Pike County Murders in 2016.   Pike County’s budget is $10 million per year, and for the trial alone, the cost is expected to run over $4 million. Smaller counties simply cannot afford to carry out capital cases, and if the state assists smaller counties like Pike consistently, Ohio will start going down a financial black hole.The cost of adjudicating a murder case is far more complex than it may appear on the surface.Death penalty cases are more expensive at every stage of the judicial process, racking up exorbitant costs even before a single appeal is filed. Compared to non-death cases, death penalty cases involve:More pre-trial preparationsMore pre-trial motionsMore experts hired by both the prosecution and the defenseTwo defense lawyers instead of oneA much longer and more complicated jury selection processA two-phase trial – the first phase to determine guilt or innocence, and the second phase for sentencing.The enormous costs involved in today’s death penalty cases also raise issues about whether the funds used to seek executions can be more effectively spent to achieve some of the goals that the death penalty allegedly seeks, such as providing help for families of homicide victims or implementing more effective ways to reduce rates of criminal violence.Copyright © 2022 · undesign on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in
