The Chinese government officially denies the torture allegations, and South Korea is hesitant to press the matter before any international bodies or courts until it has material evidence that torture occurred.Although most of the bruises and scars have faded by now, Kim knows that a forensic medical evaluation conducted in compliance with the UN Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (aka “Istanbul Protocol”) constitutes critically important evidence in torture cases. Trained clinicians examine all signs of physical and psychological abuse and produce a medical-legal affidavit documenting their conclusions. These affidavits often serve as key evidence to prosecute perpetrators of torture.Kim’s first set of medical evaluations took place on August 8, but the clinicians provided conflicting interpretations regarding a facial bruise. Kim is scheduled to undergo a more thorough examination next week.It is critically important that Kim be evaluated by at least one clinician who has not only undergone Istanbul Protocol training but has also performed forensic evaluations recently and on a regular basis. Additionally, the South Korean government must ensure that the evaluators are objective, operating under complete clinical independence, and free from any undue political influence within or outside South Korea.RelatedWebinarNext Steps for the Global Anti-Torture Movement: Istanbul Protocol 2022Press ReleaseAnti-Torture Experts Launch updated ‘Istanbul Protocol,’ the New Global Standards for Investigation and Documentation of TortureReport“Part of my heart was torn away”: What the U.S. Government Owes the Tortured Survivors of Family SeparationDonate$50$100$250$500$1000DonateSign UpJoinEnter a valid email addressInvalid email addressSuccess!Shared in the 1997Nobel Peace PrizeFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeHomeOur Work© Physicians for Human Rights 2022PHR Privacy Policy
