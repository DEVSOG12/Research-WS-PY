The document provides a cascade ofself-justification and minimization of the risks and harm to detainees.“Whilemuch of the information in this document was already known, the step-by-step internalprocess it details shows how health professionals continually acceded to thedemands of those running the interrogation regime, relied on flawed legalinterpretations of torture definitions, and failed to live up to their duty to ‘do noharm,’” said Scott Allen, MD,FACP, professor emeritus at University ofCalifornia Riverside School of Medicine and PHR medical advisor.Thedocument further describes how certain techniques, such as confinement in acoffin-sized box, forced nakedness, near-hypothermia, prolonged sleepdeprivation, and waterboarding were not considered to be torture because theywere deemed not to cause “prolonged (mental) harm lasting months or years.”  It is now clear that these determinations werebased on the Office of Legal Counsel’s faulty interpretation of torture thatelevated physical and mental pain thresholds and the condition of specificintent to cause such pain.“Thedocument makes the claim that OMS personnel served to protect detainees andensure safe, legal, and effective interrogations, but provides no evidence thatdetainees were evaluated appropriately. In fact, it states that psychologicalassessments did not include the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder,the most common psychological condition following torture. The document also failsto mention the OMS practice of forced rectal feeding, for which there is nomedical indication and which represents a form of sexual assault” said PHRSenior Medical Advisor Vincent Iacopino, MD, PhD.Inaddition, the document’s conclusion that the interrogation techniques did notcause long-lasting harm has been proven wrong. Some detainees subjected to thesetorture techniques who are still held in the Guantánamo Bay detention facilityremain severely traumatized, according to PHRmedical experts who have examined them. Detainees who have been evaluatedafter their release from Guantánamo, and elsewhere, also continue to showlong-lasting harm, as described in reports such as PHR’s Broken Laws,Broken Lives.Thedocument refers to OMS practices being in compliance with AmericanPsychological Association (APA) policies, but fails to acknowledge collusionbetween the APA, the CIA, and the Department of Defense in establishing thosepolicies. These policies have since been abandoned. The document also attemptsto defend against criticism of breaches of medical ethics by indicating thatOMS participation was voluntary, that its practices were considered “legal” bythe U.S. Department of Justice at the time, and that actionable intelligencewas obtained and lives were saved. The author of the document rejectsinternational medical ethical principles of “do no harm” as well as legalprohibitionsagainst participation in torture by asserting that “saving lives” takespriority over respect for human dignity. We have learned since, from a 2014 SenateSelect Committee on Intelligence report, that no actionable intelligence was ever obtainedusing “enhanced interrogation” techniques that could not otherwise have been gathered.Thisdocument is a revealing self-indictment of U.S. torture practices and thecritical role of CIA OMS personnel in participating in and concealing torture.It shows health professionals’ disregard for core ethical principles, includingthe World MedicalAssociation’s Declaration of Tokyo, requiring that they remove themselvesfrom all forms of participation in torture or ill-treatment.“Thisdocument shows that within the CIA OMS culture in the post-9/11 years, therewas a lack of understanding of the moral and ethical issues involved in thepresence and cooperation of health professionals in interrogations and theirwillingness to preside over the deliberate infliction of pain on detainees,”Iacopino said. “The author of the document expresses continual concern for thephysical safety of detainees, but he shows no qualms about OMS personnelparticipating in the interrogations that caused great pain and suffering to thedetainees. This was an improper role for health professionals and OMS showsthat it was blind or indifferent to ethical concerns raised by theirparticipation,” he added.Basedon the new details in this document, PHR renews its call on the U.S.government, especially all CIA medical professionals, to take immediate action tomake structural and procedural reforms to ensure that such human rights abuses– including the collusion and cover up of health professionals, in violation oftheir professional ethics – never happen again. As an organization of healthprofessionals, PHR looks forward to those in positions of authority recognizingthe important role played by doctors, psychologists, therapists, and others whopractice medicine to ensure that torture tactics are never enabled byprofessionals whose primary obligation is to their patients, and that allagency operations respect the right to dignity and care for the individual.Torture isabsolutely prohibited under U.S. and international law at all times, andpreventing the torture of those in custody is integral to the ethical dutiesand culture of health professionals. Torture violates everything that healthprofessionals stand for and PHR will continue to advocate to ensure the U.S.government never engages in torture again.Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.
