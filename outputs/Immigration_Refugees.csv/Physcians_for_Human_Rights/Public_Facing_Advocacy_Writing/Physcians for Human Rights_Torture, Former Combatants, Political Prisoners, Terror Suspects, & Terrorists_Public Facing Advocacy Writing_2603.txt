PHR clinicians conducted in-depth interviews and structured psychological assessments of 21 formerly-detained Syrian health professionals, providing new insight into how the Syrian government has grotesquely punished health workers for carrying out their professional duties.“The searingtestimonies of inhumane detention conditions and brutal torture techniques thatwe gathered from Syrian physicians, pharmacists, paramedics, and others shednew light on one of the most depraved aspects of Assad’s war on his ownpeople,” said MicheleHeisler, MD, medical director at Physicians for Human Rights and reportco-author. “All available evidence points consistently toward the Syriangovernment’s systematic and strategic persecution of health workers.”In PHR’sanalysis, these assaults against health workers are a key component of the warcrimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Syrian government. Buildingon abundant existing evidence of the Syrian government’s attacks on the health sector and its widespread use of torture to intimidatepopulations and suppress perceived dissent, PHR finds that the Syriangovernment has violated both domestic and international laws. It has trampledon fundamental medical ethics and decimated the Syrian health system, causingwidespread death and suffering over the eight-year conflict.Parallel andongoing research by Physicians for Human Rightspoints to how these violations fit into a broader pattern of Syrian government targetingof health care facilities and personnel. Since March 2011, PHR has documentedthe killings of at least 914 civilian medical personnel in Syria. Medicalpersonnel killed while providing care have predominantly lost their livesduring attacks upon medical facilities or while providing first aid in thefield. PHR has also documented 588 attacks on 350 health facilities in Syria. Thedocumentation attributes more than 90 percent of the documented attacks onhealth facilities and personnel to the Syrian government and its allies,including Russia.From thecircumstances surrounding their arrests to the nature of their interrogations, thetorture inflicted on them, and court appearances, the health workers’testimonies demonstrate how their provision of medical services wasspecifically invoked by Syrian authorities throughout their time in detention. Thereport details the arrests of many health professionals while they were workingin hospitals or delivering medical supplies to facilities. Most sources PHRinterviewed were accused by their torturers of providing medical care to “terrorists.”Healthprofessionals interviewed for this study reported that Syrian security forcesregularly beat, humiliated, starved, and subjected them to stress positions andsolitary confinement – in one case for 14 months. Health workers reported toPHR that they were burned, shocked with electricity, sexually assaulted, andforced to witness torture and sexual assault of fellow detainees. PHR cliniciansdocumented how the infliction of torture resulted in severe physical andpsychological trauma and, in some cases, permanent disability. The reportrecognizes that the 21 health workers interviewed were among those fortunateenough to make it out of Syrian detention facilities alive. The health workersreported that they had witnessed the deaths of fellow medical workers indetention.“The Syriangovernment’s widespread campaign of arrest, detention, and torture of healthworkers fits into a disturbing broader pattern,” said Rayan Koteiche, researcher at PHR and report co-author. “Theirscorched-earth strategy: bomb and destroy facilities. Punish anyone providingmedical care in opposition areas. Torture health workers. Annihilate the healthsystem.”The reportalso highlights the remarkable resilience and professional commitment of Syrianhealth workers. Even while confined in life-threatening prison conditions andsubjected to torture, some of the health workers continued to provide what careand support they could to their fellow detainees. Upon their eventual release, themajority of the health workers PHR interviewed returned to work in the healthor humanitarian fields, either elsewhere in Syria or in neighboring countries,sometimes at great personal risk.The Syriangovernment’s industrial-scale incarceration apparatus – which has enabled the detention,interrogation, torture, extrajudicial execution, and disappearance of tens ofthousands of civilians – has been extensively documented by United Nationsbodies and human rights monitors. The PHR report documents a new andunderrecognized dimension of the Syrian government’s immense catalog of warcrimes – the purposeful targeting of health workers for arrest, detention, andtorture. Medical ethics requires health professionals to provide care withoutdiscrimination to all, regardless of political affiliation.“Physiciansfor Human Rights calls on all parties to the conflict, particularly the Syriangovernment and affiliated forces, to immediately and unconditionally releaseall arbitrarily or unlawfully detained individuals and allow unconditionalaccess to detention sites in the country. The Syrian government must respectthe rights and dignity of all Syrian citizens, including the health careworkers on whom all Syrians rely, and must stop criminalizing health care,”said Susannah Sirkin,director of policy at PHR. “United Nations member states, regional bodies, andthe international community must hold the Syrian government  accountable for its systematic persecution,detention, and torture of health care workers, which should shock theconscience of all humanity.”PHR furthercalls on national governments to support justice and accountability, includingby exercising universal jurisdiction, to investigate and prosecute Syrianmilitary and civilian officials responsible for committing war crimes andcrimes against humanity in Syria. Such efforts in France, Germany, Norway andelsewhere are emerging signs of promise that the prevailing state of impunity forcrimes in Syria will end.The fullreport is available here.Selectedquotes from Syrian health workers interviewed for “MyOnly Crime Was That I Was a Doctor”: How the Syrian Government Targets HealthWorkers for Arrest, Detention, and Torture:“I was working in the emergency ward, changing a patient’s dressing. I felt a tap on my shoulder … my arms were twisted behind my back, and I was slammed against a wall. I was handcuffed, blindfolded, and quickly loaded into a vehicle…. The entire medical staff was arrested on that day.” – Hassan,* a nurse from Homs.“He [my torturer] kept saying that ‘you are a group of organized doctors and you have your own field hospitals and your own warehouses’ … He wanted names of doctors and where the field hospitals and warehouses were.” –Wessam,* a health volunteer from Rural Damascus.“Losing consciousness was a blessing because it was a break from all the physical and psychological torture.” –Tareq,* a health activities coordinator from Aleppo.“Every cell of my body writhed from the pain. You feel like you can’t stop shrieking. The shocks bounced me around the room. Even after it was over, the pain persisted as if I was still being electrocuted.”  –Dr. Ibrahim,* a pediatrician from Daraa.“They brought in two women and the soldiers on duty raped them right in front of us. One of them fainted from screaming. I thought she was dead. She was a nurse from Qusair in Homs. Confronting those kinds of atrocities and feeling powerless in front of this inhumanity is much harder than physical torture.” –Tareq,* a health activities coordinator from Aleppo.“We got used to the smell of dead bodies.” – Omar,* a health volunteer from Harast.“I did have a lot of hopelessness and guilt but working with detainees transformed my bitterness to energy.” – Wessam,* a health volunteer from Rural Damascus.*Names changed to protect interviewees from reprisals.Supported with German Federal Foreign Office’s funds by ifa (Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen), Funding Programme zivik.Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.
