This bill was introduced by State Senator Julia Salazar (D18) and Assemblymember Karines Reyes (D87). We signed a letter urging the legislature to pass the bill.The Dignity Not Detention Act comes on the heels of multiple announcements out of New Jersey that local county jails—Essex, Hudson, and Elizabeth—may end their contracts with ICE to detain immigrants and will start depopulating their facility.“Immigration detention is an extension of the racist U.S. criminal system and should not exist,” said Attorney and Bertha Justice Fellow Samah Sisay. “New York has the opportunity to join the growing national movement to end ICE detention and affirm the dignity and right of immigrants to fight their civil cases in their communities instead of in cages.” Continue reading on our website.ICYMI: Wednesday’s #FreeAshleyDiamond letter writing eventWe are honored to have joined the #FreeAshleyNow team and partners for a letter writing and educational event for our client, Ashley Diamond.
