Even assuming he was indeed fighting in the context of armed conflict, civilians directly participating in hostilities must be charged promptly or released, not held indefinitely, and treated humanely in the interim. That is the law, much as we have forgotten it in the United States over the past 16 years of the "war on terror." If he is held without charge at Guantánamo or some other site for prolonged detention, the Trump administration should know that litigation awaits.  The Center for Constitutional Rights has led the legal battle over Guantánamo for more than 15 years – representing clients in two Supreme Court cases and organizing and coordinating hundreds of pro bono lawyers across the country, ensuring that nearly all the men detained at Guantánamo have had the option of legal representation. Among other Guantánamo cases, the Center represents the families of men who died at Guantánamo, and men who have been released and are seeking justice in international courts.The Center for Constitutional Rights works with communities under threat to fight for justice and liberation through litigation, advocacy, and strategic communications. Since 1966, the Center for Constitutional Rights has taken on oppressive systems of power, including structural racism, gender oppression, economic inequity, and governmental overreach.
