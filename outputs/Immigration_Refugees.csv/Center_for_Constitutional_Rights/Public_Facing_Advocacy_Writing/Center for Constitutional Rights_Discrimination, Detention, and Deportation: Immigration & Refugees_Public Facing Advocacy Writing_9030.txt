Below is a report of today's events from Lupe.It's been a long day traveling from the LA area early this morning since I couldn't cross into TJ [Tijuana] yesterday as I had originally planned. Today we met with about 20 UACs [unaccompanied alien child] and did intakes and consultations with them. The day ended on a high note since we got some youth back from Mexican immigration right before we finished the day--gotta take the victories when/where we can. This is amazing since UACs are especially and particularly vulnerable here--getting detained by the Mexican feds can mean quick deportations for them and we were really worried about them. I am humbled by the efforts of the folks and volunteers down here. I am also really disappointed with the characterization of the events from Sunday. I think it's really important to counter the mainstream narrative. [Here is] a post from a volunteer I'm working with who was one of the few volunteers on the ground during yesterday's chaos if you want to get another perspective as to what happened.
