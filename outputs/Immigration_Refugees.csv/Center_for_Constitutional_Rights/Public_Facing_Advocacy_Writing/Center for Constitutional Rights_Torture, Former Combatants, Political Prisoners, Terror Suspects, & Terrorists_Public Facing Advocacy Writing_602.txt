Spain’s Popular Party (PP) fast-tracked legislation restricting the court’s ability to take on such cases, in an apparent bow to external political pressure and against the strong opposition of human rights advocates. The new restrictions, which went into effect last month, have triggered a flurry of filings followed by decisions from different judges seized with investigations of torture or war crimes committed outside Spain. Thus far, judges have refused to close on-going investigations, including cases involving violations committed in Western Sahara, El Salvador, and the killing of a Spanish journalist in Iraq.“The Spanish government introduced a law reform contradicting its obligations under international law. We welcome the decision by Judge Ruz to continue the investigations on Guantánamo. Violations of the absolute prohibition of torture must be prosecuted,” said Andreas Schueller of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR).CCR and ECCHR have both been admitted to the proceedings, as legal representatives for two former Guantánamo detainees. A Spanish resident is among the plaintiffs in the case.“Judge Ruz has accepted our legal arguments and the case is far from being closed. There is still an opportunity for justice in Spain,” said Gonzalo Boye, a Madrid-based lawyer who represents former detainees in the proceedings.For more information and filings, visit the websites of the CCR and ECCHR.The Center for Constitutional Rights is dedicated to advancing and protecting the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. CCR has led the legal battle over Guantánamo since 2002 – representing clients in two United States Supreme Court cases and organizing and coordinating hundreds of pro bono lawyers across the country to represent the men at Guantánamo.
