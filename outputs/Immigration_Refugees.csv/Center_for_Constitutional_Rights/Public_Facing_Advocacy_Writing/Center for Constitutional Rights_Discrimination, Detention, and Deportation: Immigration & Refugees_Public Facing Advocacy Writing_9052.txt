His travel ban, an executive order prohibiting travel from seven (then, after a March revision, six) predominantly Muslim countries, appears intended to assuage white supporters who harbor twisted ideas of both their racial identity and what terrorists look like. The ban not only vividly brands Muslims as extremists, but also ignores terrorist acts committed by white Americans. And the Supreme Court just gave Trump an assist.The nine justices announced on Monday that the Court would hear arguments on the ban in October. They also stayed the lower court judgments currently blocking the ban, which means part of it will be put into effect by Thursday. There is absolutely no justification for this, governmental or moral. Besides, Trump’s original order specified a 90-day restriction on travelers from those nations and a 120-day ban on refugees who weren’t from Syria. More than 150 days into his presidency, he and the White House have had the time they needed to craft new policy to address foreign terrorism. Still, it isn't nearly the ban Trump signed in January. The measure to be reinstated later this week states that "Foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States," barred originally, will now meet the standard of entry.Read the full piece here.Last modified June 28, 2017The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesMuslim ProfilingSpread the wordTweetShareEmailPress InquiriesPlease contact us for general press inquiries, or to set up interviews.press@ccrjustice.orgJoin Our Press ListSign Up NowStaff ExpertsWe can connect you with just the right person at CCR for the story you’re working on.(Select an Expertise)Abusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQ PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual & Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismFind an ExpertWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
