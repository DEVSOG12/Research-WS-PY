But as the courts become a less friendly forum, we will double down on this oppressive system of power just as we did when we worked with Fannie Lou Hamer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in the 1960s; with reproductive justice advocates in the 1970s; with freedom fighters struggling against repressive governments in Central America in the 1980s; with relatives of murdered activists who were fighting for human rights and environmental justice in Nigeria in the 1990s; with detainees who have been indefinitely confined and tortured at Guantánamo in the 2000s; with Black and Brown New York City residents who were unconstitutionally stopped and frisked in the 2010s; and with transgender Black women for access to healthcare and release from prison today. Continue reading on our website.Last modified October 5, 2020View the discussion thread.Spread the wordTweetShareEmailStaff favoritesPresident Obama: What Are You Waiting for?
