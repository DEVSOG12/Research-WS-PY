CuccinelliAt a GlanceDate Filed: August 27, 2019Current Status On October 11, 2019, a federal court granted plaintiffs' motion and issued a preliminary injunction, stopping DHS from enforcing the rule nationwide.Our Team:Ghita SchwarzBaher AzmyElsa Maria MotaBaher AzmyCo-Counsel The Legal Aid Society, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLPClient(s) Make the Road New York, African Services Committee, Asian American Federation, Catholic Charities Community Services, and Catholic Legal Immigration NetworkAugust 26, 2019Case Description Since taking office, the Trump administration has been committed in its attack against low-income immigrants of color. One of its priorities has been to transform the system of family-based immigration by redefining millions of immigrants as future public charges and to deny them green cards as a result. In response to the administration's release of "Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds," a rule seeking to vastly expand the number of individuals denied green cards, Make the Road New York, African Services Committee, Asian American Federation, Catholic Charities Community Services, and Catholic Legal Immigration Network filed a case seeking to prevent the rule from ever taking effect.The rule raises the income, language, and wealth requirements for immigrants seeking to become permanent residents, and penalizes immigrants for even the most minimal use of public benefits such as Medicaid. Our plaintiffs have devoted immense resources to educating their constituent communities about the effects of the rule and have documented the widespread fear the rule has already caused, with many immigrants disenrolling from crucial nutritional, health, and housing assistance. It will cause particular harm to Latinx, Black, Asian, and disabled immigrants. Filed in the Southern District of New York, Make the Road New York v. Cuccinelli claims violations of the Administrative Procedure Act's prohibition on arbitrary and capricious rulemaking, and alleges that the rule is contrary to the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection principles. It is part of CCR's tradition of fighting for immigrants' rights and economic justice.Case FilesJoint Stipulation to Dismiss 2021.03.09.pdf 2021.02.22 Order list.pdf MOL ISO Motion for Partial SJ on FVRA Claims 2020.10.27.pdf 249.Defendants' Opp to SJ & MTD on FVRA Claims.11 17 2020.pdf cuccinelli 2020-10-07 - DHS v.
