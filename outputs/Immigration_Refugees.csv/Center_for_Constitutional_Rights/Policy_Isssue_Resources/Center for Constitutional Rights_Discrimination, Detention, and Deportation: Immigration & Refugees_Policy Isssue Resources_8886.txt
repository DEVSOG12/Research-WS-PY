Barr, challenging the removal order of Ousman Darboe, a 26-year-old husband and father from the Gambia who spent over three years in civil immigration detention. The amicus brief contextualizes the circumstances of Mr. Darboe's arrests by highlighting the disproportionate impact of the NYPDs stop-and-frisk practice on Black and Latinx communities – particularly in the Bronx – and the systemic anti-Blackness and coerciveness of the criminal legal system. The brief supports Mr. Darboe’s petition for review and explains how race-based policing and an unreliable and coercive criminal justice system lead to unsubstantiated arrests and convictions that have dire consequences, especially for Black immigrants.Case TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersDecember 10, 2020Amicus brief filed in Second CircuitDecember 10, 2020Amicus brief filed in Second CircuitRelated FilesDarboe CCR Innocence Project Amicus and Motion to File.pdfLast modified:December 11, 2020Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesDiscriminatory PolicingRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
