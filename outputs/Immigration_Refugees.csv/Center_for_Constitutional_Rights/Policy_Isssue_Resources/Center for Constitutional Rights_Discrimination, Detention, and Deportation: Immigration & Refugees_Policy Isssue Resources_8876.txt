MayorkasAt a GlanceDate Filed: November 13, 2017Current Status On September 2, 2021 Judge Bashant partially grants plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.Our Team:Baher AzmyAngelo GuisadoElsa Maria MotaBaher AzmyAngelo GuisadoCo-Counsel Southern Poverty Law Center, American Immigration Council, Mayer BrownClient(s) Al Otro Lado, a non-profit legal services organization, and plaintiffs Abigail Doe, Beatrice Doe, Carolina Doe, Dinora Doe, Ingrid Doe, and Jose Doe, acting on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals presenting themselves at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border.July 11, 2017Case Description Al Otro Lado, Inc., et al. v. Alejandro Mayorkas, et al., is a class action lawsuit against officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in a federal district court in California challenging CBP’s unlawful practice of depriving asylum seekers access to the U.S. asylum process. The plaintiffs allege that CBP and DHS are systematically violating U.S. and international law by denying individuals even the opportunity to apply for asylum; instead the government is consistently turning away individuals facing persecution, forcing them to return to countries where they face grave violence and risk of death.The lawsuit documents numerous cases in which CBP denied asylum seekers who presented themselves at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border the right to seek protection in the United States. This illegal conduct included falsely representing to individuals that asylum is no longer available in the United States, that asylum seekers need permission from the Mexican government to seek asylum, or that asylum seekers must apply at other locations. In some cases, asylum seekers were threatened and falsely told that if they did not abandon their effort to obtain asylum, they would lose custody of their children.The government’s illegal conduct is occurring as the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras are experiencing levels of violence not seen since civil wars wracked the region decades ago; the UNHCR recorded a nearly fivefold increase in people from these countries seeking asylum in the United States since 2008.Women in particular – and especially transgender women – and children can experience extreme violence when fleeing their home countries, facing rape, assault, and extortion. Black immigrants are also facing escalating denials, with many Haitian refugees seeking asylum at the border. Immigrant justice advocates point to U.S. foreign policy fueling violence and instability in Central America for decades as the root cause of this crisis, now being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s escalation of draconian immigration policies.As an increasing number of Central Americans are applying for asylum in Mexico, the U.S. government is actively encouraging and funding the Mexican government to increase the detention and deportation of Central American asylum seekers found within their territory. At the same time, unprecedented levels of violence throughout Mexico are displacing thousands of Mexican families, many of whom cannot find safety in their own country and are forced to seek safety in the U.S. CBP’s unlawful conduct can constitute a death sentence for asylum seekers, many of whom are being actively pursued during their dangerous journey to the border.This case is part of the Center for Constitution al Rights’ larger work fighting abusive immigration policies, supporting immigrants and immigrant rights organizations, and upholding international human rights.Case Files816 Order- (1) Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs Motions Seeking Clarification or 2022.08.05.pdf 817 Remedies Opinion Judge Cynthia Bashant 2022.08.05.pdf 742 Order granting in part Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment 2021.08.02.pdf Order granting TRO.pdf Second Asylum Ban TRO filing.pdf AOL MSJ.pdf ORDER Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. [390]) (2) Denying as Moot.pdf 3.5.2020 CA9 order lifting stay metering + transit ban.pdf 48 Appellees' answering brief 19-56417 2020.02.04.pdf 390-1 Memo ISO Class Cert 2020.01.14.pdf 42 Ds Opening Appeal 2020.01.07.pdf Defendants TRO Opposition 2019.12.17.pdf Plaintiffs Reply Guatemala ACA 2019.12.20.pdf Order Denying Motion for TRO Without Prejudice 2020.01.07 .pdf Temporary Restraining Order Guatemala ACA 2019.12.06.pdf Class Cert Memo 2019.12.11.pdf Class Cert Opp Brief 2019.12.30.pdf Notice of Appeal to CA9 2019.12.04.pdf Defendants Motion to Stay pending appeal 2019.12.04.pdf Order granting admin stay pending appeal 2019.12.20.pdf AOL Order Class Cert and PI 2019.11.19.pdf AOL Class Cert Motion 2019.09.26.pdf AOL Preliminary Injunction Motion 2019.09.26.pdf Selected Exhibits Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Motion to Dismiss Defendants Reply ISO Motion to Partially Dismiss Second Amended Complaint Amicus Brief of Members of Congress 2019.02.21 219.pdf Amicus Brief of 19 Orgs who Represent Asylum Seekers 2019.02.21 223.pdf Amicus Brief of Kids In Need of Defense 2019.02.21 225.pdf Amicus Brief of Immigration Law Scholars 221.pdf Amicus Brief of Amnesty International 2019.02.21 216.pdf Amicus Brief of 19 States and Washington DC 2019.02.21 215.pdf Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Gov't Memo ISO 2d MTD.pdf Second Amended Complaint Amended Complaint Order on MTD 2018.08.20.pdf Defendants' Reply ISO Motion to Dismiss Ps' Opposition to Motion to Dismiss Defendants' Motion to Dismiss 2017.12.14 AOL Complaint 7.12.2017.pdf Al Otro Lado salida de prensa Espanol.docx Gov't Memo ISO 2d MTD.pdf Amicus Brief of Members of Congress 2019.02.21 219.pdf Amicus Brief of 19 Orgs who Represent Asylum Seekers 2019.02.21 223.pdf Amicus Brief of Kids In Need of Defense 2019.02.21 225.pdf Amicus Brief of Immigration Law Scholars 221.pdf Amicus Brief of Amnesty International 2019.02.21 216.pdf Amicus Brief of 19 States and Washington DC 2019.02.21 215.pdf 189 Second Amended Complaint 2018.11.13.pdf 210 - AOL Opp to Defs Motion to Dismiss (1).pdf 238 Defendants_ Reply ISO Their Motion to Partially Dismiss 2d Amended Complaint.pdf Order granting in part and denying in part MTD 7.29.19 .pdf AOL Class Cert Motion 2019.09.26.pdf AOL Preliminary Injunction Motion 2019.09.26.pdf PI motion selected exhibits.pdf AOL Order Class Cert and PI 2019.11.19.pdf Order Denying Motion for TRO Without Prejudice 2020.01.07 .pdf 0816.
