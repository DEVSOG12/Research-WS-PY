These complaints included direct testimony of medical abuse, sexual assault, religious discrimination, deplorable conditions, retaliation for peaceful protest and public reporting, ICE failing to follow court orders and release high-risk individuals suffering from complications related to COVID-19, and use of force and physical abuse at the hands of ICE guards, sergeants, and lieutenants.Freedom for Immigrants, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and UnLocal, Inc. collected these testimonies to submit a multi-individual Civil Rights and Civil Liberties complaint from 15 immigrants currently and formerly detained at Bergen County Jail, including individuals who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation and additional abuse after coming forward.The complaint urges the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) to immediately 1) investigate medical practices, use of force, religious discrimination, sexual assault, deplorable conditions, and denial of release at Bergen County Jail; 2) recommend that ICE terminate the Intergovernmental Services Agreement (IGSA) with Bergen County Jail; and 3) recommend the immediate release to the community of all individuals detained.ICE detention centers and jails highlight the inhumanity of the vast criminalization and incarceration system in the United States. This filing is situated in the broader movement for a positive vision of mass decarceration. The Center for Constitutional Rights is a member of the Abolish ICE NY-NJ coalition, a formation of immigrant rights organizations and activists across New York and New Jersey organizing to free people from detention, end local ICE contracts, and stop deportations. Immigrants detained in New York and New Jersey ICE jails who have engaged in hunger strikes and spoken out against cruel treatment have been met with retaliation. Despite violent retaliation, detained immigrants continue to fight for their collective freedom.Case Files[redacted] Multi-Individual CRCL_ Bergen County Jail Abuses.pdf [redacted] Multi-Individual CRCL_ Bergen County Jail Abuses.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersJuly 13, 2021Multi-individual Civil Rights and Civil Liberties complaint submittedJuly 13, 2021Multi-individual Civil Rights and Civil Liberties complaint submittedPress Release“Egregious and Unlivable”: Immigrants in New Jersey Jail File Civil Rights Complaint Over ICE Assaults and RetaliationRelated Files[redacted] Multi-Individual CRCL_ Bergen County Jail Abuses.pdfMay 3, 2021Immigrants detained at Bergen County Jail are violently assaulted with beatings and pepper sprayMay 3, 2021Immigrants detained at Bergen County Jail are violently assaulted with beatings and pepper sprayLast modified:September 15, 2021Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesMass IncarcerationRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
