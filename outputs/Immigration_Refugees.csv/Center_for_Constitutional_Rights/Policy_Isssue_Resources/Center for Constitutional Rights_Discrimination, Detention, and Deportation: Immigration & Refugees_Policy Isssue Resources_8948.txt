He was interrogated by U.S. officials about alleged links to al-Qaeda and was repeatedly denied the right to contact his family or a lawyer. He was then sent against his will to Syria, a country renowned for torture. Mr. Arar was interrogated, tortured and held in a grave-like underground cell in Syria during most of his year-long detention. No country, including the U.S., has ever charged him with any crime.Please download our factsheet for more information about Maher Arar and CCR's case on his behalf, Arar v.
