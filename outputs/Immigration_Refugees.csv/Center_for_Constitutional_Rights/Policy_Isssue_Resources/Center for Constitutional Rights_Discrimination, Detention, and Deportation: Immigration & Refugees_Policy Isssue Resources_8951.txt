Maher, a Canadian citizen of Syrian descent, was never charged with a crime, but he lost a year of his life and carries the mental scars of his detention and torture around with him to this day. This is the story of his nightmarish year of rendition, detention and torture -- and of Maher's fight to achieve justice.Attachments  Rendition to Torture ReportLast modified January 11, 2010The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismSpread the wordTweetShareEmailGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
