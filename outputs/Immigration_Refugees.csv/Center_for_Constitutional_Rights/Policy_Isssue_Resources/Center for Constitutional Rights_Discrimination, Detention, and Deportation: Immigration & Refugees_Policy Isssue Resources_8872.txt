Document production by agencies is ongoing.Our Team:Samah SisayIan HeadElsa MotaIan HeadSamah SisayCo-Counsel Project South and Southern Poverty Law CenterClient(s) Project SouthApril 22, 2021Case Description Cameroon is in the midst of an intense civil war that has displaced 700,000 people and left 3.9 million in need of humanitarian support. Cameroonian security forces have been responsible for extrajudicial killings and torture. The Cameroonian asylum seekers deported in October and November 2020 are at risk and claim that they were tortured and forcibly deported from the U.S. despite having viable asylum claims. Advocates in the U.S. created the coalition Alliance in Defense of Black Immigrants to stop future deportations and stay in contact with and support people who have been deported to Cameroon. As part of their efforts to support the people who have already been deported, push for accountability, and seek and protective status for people from Cameroon, advocates from the coalition asked the Center for Constitutional Rights to submit FOIA requests to learn more about who was on the 2020 deportation flights and why the flights occurred despite the fact that Cameroon is clearly experiencing a civil war.These FOIAs are in partnership with Project South and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and were submitted to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of the Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), and the Department of State (DOS) for records and data concerning the recent increase of ICE removals of Cameroonians into an area of known violent conflict. Information obtained from the FOIA requests will help advocates strengthen their policy campaign and educational materials to stop deportations to Cameroon and fight for the return of the asylum seekers deported in October and November 2020. The FOIA requests focus on (1) data regarding the demographic information of persons on deportation flights to Cameroon between August 2020 and the inauguration of President Biden on January 20, 2021, including the nature and status of immigration relief requested; (2) correspondence among ICE officials and relevant consular officials regarding removals of Cameroonians and conditions in Cameroon.This FOIA case and accompanying advocacy support is being done in partnership with members of the Alliance in Defense of Black Immigrants coalition, which is comprised of interfaith groups, community advocates, family members of Cameroonians in detention and those deported, and other organizations like SPLC, Families for Freedom, and Haitian Bridge Alliance.Case TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersJuly 7, 2022Magistrate judge orders ICE and State to increase level of document productionJuly 7, 2022Magistrate judge orders ICE and State to increase level of document productionFollowing a status update by the parties, the judge issues an order on document production.Related FilesDkt 45 Processing and Production Order.pdfOctober 13, 2021Complaint filed in federal courtOctober 13, 2021Complaint filed in federal courtComplaint filed in the Southern District of New York.Press ReleaseOne Year after “Death Flights,” Civil Rights Groups Press for Information on Torture and Deportation of Cameroonian RefugeesRelated Files10-13-21 Filed Complaint - Cameroonian FOIA.pdfApril 26, 2021FOIA requests sent to federal agenciesApril 26, 2021FOIA requests sent to federal agenciesFOIAs sent to Department of State, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and the Executive Office for Immigration Review.Press ReleaseFollowing Government’s Forced ‘Death Flight’ Deportations and Torture of Black Immigrants, Advocates Seek AnswersRelated FilesCCR Project South SPLC Cameroonian Deportations FOIA Request - Emails.pdfCCR Project South SPLC Cameroonian Deportations FOIA Request - Data.pdfLast modified:July 13, 2022Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesOpen Records Project: FOIA for the MovementRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
