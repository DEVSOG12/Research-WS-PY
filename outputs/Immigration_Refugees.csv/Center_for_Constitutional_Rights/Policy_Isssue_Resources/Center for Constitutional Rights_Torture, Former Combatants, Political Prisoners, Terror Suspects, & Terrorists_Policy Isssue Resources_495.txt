These so-called targeted killings have left thousands of people dead and injured, including hundreds of children. Three successive administrations have claimed the executive power to order these killings without needing to provide any legal or factual explanation to the public, to most members of Congress, or to the courts. They have destroyed entire families and communities – lost lives the U.S. has mostly not even acknowledged, let alone redressed. As these killings dramatically increased under the Obama administration, CCR was among the first to speak out. Through federal court litigation, international advocacy, and media outreach, we have fought for years to expose and end the illegality, immorality, and harm of this program. While the technology of armed drones is new, unlawful and misguided uses of armed force by the United States is longstanding, and CCR’s opposition to this program is part of our historic resistance to the overuse of American military power.NewsSee more NewsAugust 2, 2022On the Extrajudicial Killing of al-ZawahiriAugust 2, 2022, New York – In response to the U.S. government’s extrajudicial killing of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Center for Constitutional Rights issued the following statement: More than twenty years after 9/11 and nearly a year after President Biden withdrew troops from Afghanistan...September 28, 2021Resumption of ICC Investigation Into Afghanistan, While Welcome, Should Not Exclude Groups of Victims or Crimes Within Court's JurisdictionSeptember 28, 2021 – Yesterday, the ICC Prosecutor announced that he had requested to resume the investigation into international crimes in the Afghanistan situation and that he would be focusing on investigations into crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban and...September 27, 2021International Criminal Court Shutters Investigation Into U.S. TortureProsecutor Seeks to Move Forward With Investigation Against Only Taliban, Islamic State-Khorasan Province September 27, 2021—Prosecutor Karim A.A.
