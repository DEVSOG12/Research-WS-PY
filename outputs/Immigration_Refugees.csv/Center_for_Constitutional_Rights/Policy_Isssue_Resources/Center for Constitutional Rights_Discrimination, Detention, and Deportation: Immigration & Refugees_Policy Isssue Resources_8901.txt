U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) was a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit that forced the U.S. government to release documents about the origins and implementation of the controversial Secure Communities (SCOMM) deportation and fingerprinting program. The disclosed information was used to support NDLON’s campaign to stop the expansion of the program and lobby for its termination as part of comprehensive immigration reform. The case is part of CCR’s long-held commitment to use litigation to support, publicize, and advance struggles for human rights and social justice.SCOMM began as a pilot program under President George W. Bush, but was vastly expanded by President Obama, over the protests of local and state leaders, contributing to his administration’s record-setting deportation numbers. The program instituted a mechanism to run fingerprints through various databases so that anyone booked into a local jail, regardless of how minor the charges or even if no charges were pressed at all, had their immigration status checked. These checks were performed on presumptively innocent arrestees prior to any conviction. Although Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presented SCOMM as an innocuous information sharing program, documents uncovered over the course of the litigation revealed the program’s true objectives: to funnel even more people into a quota-driven immigration detention and removal system, and center local law enforcement in the government’s dragnet deportation scheme. Disclosed documents also showed that SCOMM was a key component of the FBI’s ever-expanding Next Generation Identification (NGI) system, which collects and stores personal biometric information on citizens and non-citizens alike. This bio-data includes fingerprints, DNA, a person’s gait and iris scans, facial measurements, and voice recognition.Revelations from the litigation combined with NDLON’s grassroots organizing galvanized local communities and prompted several governors to publicly seek to opt their states out of the program. In response, the Obama administration reversed its original position that SCOMM was voluntary, and announced that the program was mandatory for all jurisdictions as part of the FBI's broader "Next Generation Identification" data-sharing program.While President Obama insisted that SCOMM targeted "criminals," internal government records showed otherwise.The case was settled on July 3, 2013, with the U.S. government agreeing to disclose new data about ICE’s use of immigration detainers. Also known as ICE holds, these detainers seek to hold an individual detained after they are eligible for release, in order to provide immigration agents with time to decide whether to begin a deportation proceeding. Under the agreement, the government was also required to provide records on the contemplated expansion of local law enforcement officials’ power to access federal immigration databases through mobile devices. The case also marked a major victory for open government, setting important precedent on the government’s obligations under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to provide electronic records.On November 21, 2014, after six years in operation and in response to mounting public pressure, the Obama administration ended SCOMM.Case FilesStipulation of Settlement Opinion and Order on Adequacy of Search DHS OIG Secure Communities Report 1 DHS OIG Secure Communities Report 2 ICE-Detainer-Documents-for-Release-3-16-12-Index.pdf Selected Detainer-related FOIA Documents Defendants' Brief in Support of Summary Judgment (3-2-12) Plaintiffs Opposition and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (3-26-12) Defendants' Reply Brief (4-9-12) Plaintiffs' Reply Brief (4-16-12) Defendants' Brief in Support of their Motion for Stay Pending Appeal (11-14-11) Plaintiffs Brief in Opposition (11-18-11) ICE October 2nd 2010 "Mandatory Memo" (Released 1-9-12) Index of Selected FBI FOIA Documents Selected FBI FOIA Documents (zip file) Order Granting Summary Judgment for Plaintiffs Regarding October 2, 2010 ICE Memo Order Granting Stay to Government Defendants' Brief in Support of Summary Judgment Plaintiffs' Opposition and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (9-12-11) Defendants' Reply Brief Order Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration Index of Documents Re-Released DHS Documents Re-released ICE Documents Re-released Plaintiffs' Brief in Support of Reconsideration (7-25-11) Defendants' Brief in Opposition (8-3-11) Stipulation and Order Regarding Final Production List Scheduling Order Regarding Final Production List Order on Exemptions in Opt-Out Documents Order Withdrawing February 14, 2011 Order on Metadata Stipulation and Order on Format of Production In-camera Order New York FOIA Documents California FOIA Documents Washington, DC FOIA Documents Colorado FOIA Documents Illinois FOIA Documents Florida FOIA Documents Wisconsin FOIA Documents Washington State FOIA Documents Virginia FOIA Documents Texas FOIA Documents Pennsylvania FOIA Documents Oregon FOIA Documents North Carolina FOIA Documents New Mexico FOIA Documents Massachusetts FOIA Documents Maryland FOIA Documents Minnesota FOIA Documents Order Regarding Sampling of Records Defendants' Brief in Support of a Stay Pending Apellate Review (2-21-11) Plaintiffs' Brief Opposing Stay Pending Interlocutory Appeal (3-30-11) Defendants' Reply Brief in Further Support (4-11-11) Opinion and Order Regarding Metadata in FOIA productions (2-7-11) Supplemental Order Regarding Form of Production (2-15-11) Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment on Exemptions (1-28-11) Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' SJ Motion and Cross-motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Exemptions (2-11-11) Defendants' Reply in Support of their Partial Motion for SJ (2-18-11) Defendants' Brief in Support of Partial Summary Judgment Motion 1-17-11 NDLON Doc Release.zip Briefing Guide to Released Documents Order Regarding Production of Opt-Out and other Documents Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction Plaintiffs' "Rapid Production List" Defendants' Opposition Brief (11-12-10) Plaintiffs' Reply Brief (11-20-10) Secure_Communities_proactive_4_23_2010_media_plan1.pdf ICE Media Plan Memo NDLON FOIA Complaint (4-27-10) Defendants' Answer (7-1-10) NDLON FOIA RequestCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersJuly 3, 2013Parties reach court-approved settlementJuly 3, 2013Parties reach court-approved settlementPress ReleaseJudge Approves Landmark Settlement in Immigration Policy CaseRelated FilesStipulation of SettlementJuly 13, 2012Judge Scheindlin issues decision on adequacy of defendants' searches, orders parties to meet and confer regarding new searchesJuly 13, 2012Judge Scheindlin issues decision on adequacy of defendants' searches, orders parties to meet and confer regarding new searchesJudge Sheindlin issues her decision on the adequacy of defendants' searches, grants motions for summary judgment by OLC and EOIR, and grants in part and denies in part motions for summary judgment by ICE, FBI, DHS and plaintiffs.
