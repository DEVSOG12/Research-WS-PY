From our early support of the Sanctuary Movement and our representation of HIV-positive Haitians held in Guantánamo to our legal challenges to warrantless home raids in Latinx communities and the religious profiling and illegal detention of Muslim, South Asian, and Arab (MASA) immigrants following 9/11, the Center has fought to defend the rights of vulnerable immigrants and empower their communities. We are challenging the religious profiling and illegal detention of MASA immigrants; providing direct legal support to activists; bringing to light the expansion of immigration enforcement and privatized detention as key features of mass incarceration; and responding to the Trump administration’s cruel escalation of Obama-era policies. Through Freedom of Information Act requests and litigation, CCR has bolstered efforts by grassroots immigrant rights groups to force government transparency about policies like Secure Communities, the detention bed quota, and raid operations.NewsSee more NewsOctober 4, 2022Federal Judge Orders Search of Former Trump Administration ICE Officials for Records on Targeting of Women in SanctuaryVersión en español a seguir September 22, 2022, New York — A federal district court judge ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Tuesday to search the records of former Trump Administration officials for information about the targeting of women immigrant rights advocates who took...August 10, 2022Judge Rules Turnback Policy Illegal; Government Must End PracticeAugust 10, 2022, San Diego, CA — On Friday, August 5, a district court judge ruled in Al Otro Lado v.
