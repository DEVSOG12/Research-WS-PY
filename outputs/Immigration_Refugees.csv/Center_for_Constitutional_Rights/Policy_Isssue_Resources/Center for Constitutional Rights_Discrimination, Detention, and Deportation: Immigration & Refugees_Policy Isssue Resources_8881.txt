The lawsuit alleges that ICE retaliated against Migrant Justice for its First Amendment-protected activity, engaging in a years-long systemic campaign of surveillance, targeting, harassment, and arrest and detention of nearly a dozen of its members, a campaign that continues to present day. Reminiscent of federal efforts to invade and destabilize progressive organizations of color in the 1960’s and 1970’s, ICE specifically and explicitly targeted Migrant Justice leadership to dismantle the organization and weaken its efficacy as an advocate for the Vermont migrant community.  In order to do so, ICE relied on assistance from the Vermont DMV, which provided personal and sensitive information about Migrant Justice members as a part of the DMV’s larger discriminatory animus against the Vermont Latinx community, which as the complaint alleges, violates Equal Protection. Taken together, the ongoing campaign has chilled Migrant Justice and its members’ speech and caused them significant harm, for which plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief.Case Files22 First Amended Complaint 2019.02.07.pdf 1 Complaint 2018.11.14.pdf 22 First Amended Complaint 2019.02.07.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersOctober 28, 2020Organizational plaintiff Migrant Justice and individual plaintiffs agree to a settlement with federal defendantsOctober 28, 2020Organizational plaintiff Migrant Justice and individual plaintiffs agree to a settlement with federal defendantsThe agreement provides for deferred action, work authorization, and protection from deportation for the individual plaintiffs, sizable monetary damages in the amount of $100,000, and an agreement to disseminate a policy statement, pursuant to this case, that affirms ICE’s inability to target individuals and organizations for exercising their First Amendment protected rights.Press ReleaseMigrant Justice Settles Federal Lawsuit on ICE RetaliationJanuary 15, 2020Individual plaintiffs and Migrant Justice reach a settlement agreement with the state defendant, the Vermont Department of Motor VehiclesJanuary 15, 2020Individual plaintiffs and Migrant Justice reach a settlement agreement with the state defendant, the Vermont Department of Motor VehiclesThe agreement outlines various changes to the Vermont DMV’s policies and practices that, most notably, limit information sharing for federal immigration purposes and document requests for information by immigration officials, increase cultural competency, bias, and other training for DMV employees, and expand and improve access to Vermont’s driver privilege cards.
