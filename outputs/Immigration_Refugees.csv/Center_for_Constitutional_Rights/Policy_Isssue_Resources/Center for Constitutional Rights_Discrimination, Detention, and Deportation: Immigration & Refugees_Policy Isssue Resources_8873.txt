As organizations that engage in advocacy and public education on behalf of immigrant communities, Grassroots Leadership, Free Migration Project, Austin Sanctuary Network, and the Center for Constitutional Rights have an interest in understanding the implementation of these policies, how they were developed, and what goals the agencies have in enforcing them. The need for this information is extremely urgent, as massive fines in the hundreds of thousands of dollars have been levied against several women in sanctuary who have spoken out against these fines and U.S. immigration policy.Case FilesDkt 77 Order re SJ 9-19-22.pdf Pl SJ Cross Motion Mem of Law.pdf D Bennion Decl.pdf R Sch Decl.pdf R Sch Decl Ex A.pdf R Sch Decl Ex B.pdf R Sch Decl Ex C.pdf R Sch Decl Ex D.pdf R Sch Decl Ex E.pdf R Sch Decl Ex F.pdf Pl SJ Cross Motion Reply Mem of Law.pdf Briefing Guide_ ICE Sanctuary Fines FOIA_October 22 2020_0.pdf Austin Sanctuary Network et al Complaint ECF version.pdf Notice of Consequences for Failure to Depart 12-5-19_Redacted.pdf Withdrawl of Intention to Fine - Redacted.pdf FOIA Request - Sanctuary Fines - 9-11-19.pdf Sample Fine Letter_Redacted.pdf Sanctuary FOIA Doc 1 - Homan Delegation Order-ICE-Civil-Fines.pdf Sanctuary FOIA Doc 2 - Homan Directive on ICE Procedures for Implementing Civil Fines.pdf Sanctuary FOIA Doc 4 - Email_ICE Issues Fines.pdf Sanctuary FOIA Doc 5 - Freere Email.pdf Sanctuary FOIA Doc 3 - Email-ICE Tells Field Offices.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersSeptember 20, 2022Court orders ICE to conduct new searches, un-redact certain documents, provide additional information to plaintiffsSeptember 20, 2022Court orders ICE to conduct new searches, un-redact certain documents, provide additional information to plaintiffsPress ReleaseFederal Judge Orders Search of Former Trump Administration ICE Officials for Records on Targeting of Women in SanctuaryRelated FilesDkt 77 Order re SJ 9-19-22.pdfFebruary 4, 2022Cross-motions for summary judgment filed by partiesFebruary 4, 2022Cross-motions for summary judgment filed by partiesPlaintiffs file cross-motion for summary judgment and opposition to the government's motion for summary judgment, challenging the government's redactions as well as their searches.
