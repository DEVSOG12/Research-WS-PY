Department of Homeland Security Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: August 9, 2019Current Status The case settled in May 2022.Our Team:Ghita SchwarzIan HeadIan HeadCo-Counsel Sienna Fontaine and Paige Austin (Make the Road New York)Client(s) Make the Road New YorkAugust 9, 2019Case Description The Trump administration was dedicated to closing all avenues for immigration, from blocking asylum-seekers at the border to ending protections for Dreamers to constricting the availability of lawful permanent residence to long-time immigrants. One of its priorities had been to transform the system of family-based immigration by redefining millions of immigrants as future public charges and to deny them green cards as a result. In 2018 and 2019, in response to the administration's development of regulations redefining the public charge bar, Make the Road New York and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other agencies for information and documents. When DHS, ICE, USCIS, and the DOJ failed to produce a single document, Make the Road New York and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a case in the Eastern District of New York to enforce their rights under the FOIA. The case settled in May 2022.Case FilesStip for Dismissal So Ordered.pdf MRNY CCR v DHS et al - Settlement Agreement CCR MRNY Gov signed Final.pdf Public Charge FOIA Complaint Public Charge FOIA ComplaintCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersMay 18, 2022Parties settle case for new set of records and attorney feesMay 18, 2022Parties settle case for new set of records and attorney feesThe case is settled and dismissed.Related FilesStip for Dismissal So Ordered.pdfMRNY CCR v DHS et al - Settlement Agreement CCR MRNY Gov signed Final.pdfAugust 9, 2019Complaint filed in the Eastern District of New YorkAugust 9, 2019Complaint filed in the Eastern District of New YorkRelated FilesPublic Charge FOIA ComplaintLast modified:August 23, 2022Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesOpen Records Project: FOIA for the MovementRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
