Moderated or introduced by Guggenheim curators, these informal discussions invited different perspectives and were premised on the meeting of profound conviction with empirical experience. “Summer of Know” provided a forum for responding to and engaging with current issues as they are filtered through the lens of art.Artist and activist Mariam Ghani and Vince Warren discussed identity and national security, in a conversation moderated by Amara Antilla, Assistant Curator, on August 8, 2017.Last modified September 6, 2017The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesCriminalizing DissentMuslim ProfilingRacial InjusticeSpread the wordTweetShareEmailGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
