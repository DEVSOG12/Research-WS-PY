Ashcroft Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: April 1, 2002Current Status In 2022, the parties settled all claims, bringing plaintiffs' 20-year struggle for justice to an end.Our Team:Rachel MeeropolShayana KadidalBaher AzmyBaher AzmyShayana KadidalCo-Counsel Covington & Burling LLP, Michael Winger, Alexander A. ReinertClient(s) Ibrahim Turkmen, Akil Sachveda, Anser Mehmood, Benamar Benatta, Ahmed Khalifa, Saeed Hammouda, Purna Bajracharya, Ahmer AbbasiOctober 17, 2007Case Description Turkmen v. Ashcroft (while being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court the case caption briefly changed to Ziglar v. Abbasi) was a civil rights lawsuit filed in 2002 on behalf of a class of Muslim, South Asian, and Arab non-citizens swept up by the INS and FBI in connection with the 9/11 investigation. Based solely on their race, religion, ethnicity, and immigration status, hundreds of men were detained as “terrorism suspects” and held in brutal detention conditions for the many months it took the FBI and CIA to clear them of any connection to terrorism. They were then deported.The case sought to hold accountable high-level Bush administration officials, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft and former FBI Director Robert Mueller, for their role in ordering racial and religious profiling and abuse in detention, in violation of the detainees’ rights under the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. Our clients were held in a specially-created Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU), in solitary confinement. They were purposefully deprived of sleep, denied contact with the outside world, beaten and verbally abused, and denied the ability to practice their religion. The former wardens and other Metropolitan Detention Center officials who oversaw this abuse were also named in the case.Turkmen sought compensatory and punitive damages for our clients and fit into the Center for Constitutional Rights' larger fight for immigrant rights and government accountability, and against illegal detentions and prisoner abuse.Case FilesTurkmen Settlement Executed.pdf Turkmen 33 Appeal Brief and Special Appendix.pdf 848 Order Adopting R&R_1.pdf 838 Plaintiffs Objections to R&R.pdf 839 Hasty Objections to R&R.pdf 842 Pltfs' Resp to Hasty Ltd Obj.pdf 843 Hasty resp.pdf 846 plts supp auth ltr to irizarry.pdf 834 Gold R and R.pdf Plaintiffs Mem of Law in Support of Bivens Liability.pdf Def Hasty Mem of Law Addressing Bivens Question.pdf Plaintiffs Response Brief in Support of Bivens Liability.pdf Supreme Court decision Abbasi - Ashcroft Mueller SC Reply.pdf Abbasi - Hasty Sherman SC Reply.pdf Abbasi - Ziglar SC Reply.pdf Professors of Civil Procedure amicus Commonwealth Lawyers Association amicus Medical and Other Scientific and Health Related Professionals amicus American Association for Justice amicus ACLU amicus Americans United for Separation of Church and State amicus Asian Americans Advancing Justice amicus Former Correctional Officials amicus Immigration Detention Advocacy Organizations amicus Korematsu amicus Abbasi_respondents_SCOTUS_brief.pdf 11.18.16 Ziglar merits brief.pdf 11.18.16 Hasty Sherman merits brief.pdf 11.18.16 Ashcroft merits brief.pdf 11.18.16 Abassi J.A.pdf Hasty v.
