The New York Times described "Operation Palladium" as a “supercharged arrest operation.” ICE and DHS refused to release information on the program in response to an urgent FOIA request, filed in June 2020, over concerns about the program’s legality, so IDP and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed our lawsuit in December 2020 seeking a court order to force the agencies to produce any records they have.Case TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersMay 2, 2022Cross-motions for summary judgmentMay 2, 2022Cross-motions for summary judgmentWe challenge the government's redactions, as well as the adequacy of their searches.Related FilesPl Memo of LawDeclaration of Mizue AizekiDeclaration of Andrew WachtenheimAW Decl Ex 1.pdfAW Decl Ex 2.pdfAW Decl Ex 3.pdfAW Decl Ex 4.pdfAW Decl Ex 5.pdfAW Decl Ex 6.pdfAW Decl Ex 7.pdfAW Decl Ex 8.pdfAW Decl Ex 9.pdfAW Decl Ex 10.pdfAW Decl Ex 11.pdfAW Decl Ex 12.pdfAW Decl Ex 13.pdfAW Decl Ex 14.pdfAW Decl Ex 15.pdfAW Decl Ex 16.pdfAW Decl Ex 17.pdfPl Reply BriefDecember 16, 2020IDP and CCR file complaint in federal courtDecember 16, 2020IDP and CCR file complaint in federal courtComplaint filed in Southern District of New York.Press ReleaseImmigrant Rights Attorneys Sue DHS and ICE for Information on Terror Tactics Used in ArrestsRelated FilesECF-IDP-CCR-Palladium-Complaint.pdfECF-Palladium-Complaint-Ex-1-FOIA.pdfLast modified:July 13, 2022Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesDiscriminatory PolicingOpen Records Project: FOIA for the MovementRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
