The Obama Administration took positive steps in rolling back family detention in 2009 by releasing families from the T. Don Hutto Family Residential Facility in Taylor, Texas, and canceling a solicitation for three new family detention centers. The closure of the Berks facility is an excellent opportunity for the administration to continue to demonstrate its commitment to detention system reform by ending the practice of detaining families.In late November ICE issued a solicitation for new family detention beds in Texas. Because families and children require specialized educational, medical, and legal support, family detention in closed facilities is both inappropriate and imposes a significant financial cost on the federal government. The Performance Work Statement issued in November calls for a shelter-like, non-penal setting that is appropriate for families with young children.We applaud ICEʼs acknowledgement that a traditional detention setting is inappropriate for this population. In fact, detaining families departs from ICEʼs current enforcement priorities. Congress has repeatedly expressed its preference for release over family detention. The 2005 House Committee on Appropriations Report (H. Rep. 109-79) accompanying the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act, 2006, maintained that “[t]he Committee expects DHS to release families or use alternatives to detention…whenever possible.” Congress further opposed the use of family detention centers one year later in the 2006 House Committee on Appropriations Report (H. Rep. 109-476) accompanying the 2007 DHS appropriations bill :"The Committee encourages ICE to work with reputable non-profit organizations to consider allowing family units to participate in the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, where appropriate, or, if detention is necessary, to house these families together in non-penal homelike environments until the conclusion of their immigration proceedings."We call on the administration to prioritize release of immigrant families in all cases. We urge the administration to assign social workers to manage familiesʼ cases rather than placing them in detention. For families without housing, the administration should partner with non-profit shelter or child welfare organizations experienced in supporting asylum-seeking and immigrant families to resolve any issues preventing the direct release of families. Social workers with proven track records providing family and child welfare services offer the only appropriate expertise for supporting families in civil immigration proceedings.For questions or to follow-up on this letter, please contact Bob Libal at Grassroots Leadership at blibal@grassrootsleadership.org or (512) 971-0487 or Michelle Brané at the Womenʼs Refugee Committee atMichelleB@wrcommission.org or (646) 717-7191.Signed by the following organizations:National organizationsAmerican Civil Liberties UnionAmericaʼs Voice Education FundCatholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc.Center for Constitutional RightsDetention Watch NetworkDreamActivist.orgGrassroots LeadershipHuman Rights FirstHuman Rights Defense CenterJustice StrategiesLutheran Immigration and Refugee ServicesNational Day Laborer Organizing NetworkNational Immigration ForumNational Latina Institute for Reproductive HealthReligious InstituteRights Working GroupSouthern Poverty Law CenterUnited Methodist Church, General Board of Church and SocietyWomen's Refugee CommissionLocal & State organizationsAll of Us or None, San Francisco, CAAmerican Gateways, Austin, TXACLU of TexasThe Advocates for Human Rights, MinnesotaAmericans for Immigrant Justice (formerly Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center),Miami, FLAustin Immigrant Rights CoalitionAustin Tan Cera de la FronteraBorder Network for Human Rights, El Paso, TexasCasa Esperanza, Plainfield & Bound Brook, NJCasa Guadalupana Catholic Worker, St. Paul, MNCoalition of Latino Leaders-CLILA, Dalton, GACobb Immigrant Alliance, Cobb County, GeorigaCommunity to Community Development, Bellingham, WashingtonCentral American Resource Center (CRECEN), Houston, TXDetention Dialogues, Berkeley, CaliforniaFaithAction International House, Greensboro, NCFamilies for Freedom, New York, NYFlorida Immigrant CoalitionFlorida Coastal School of Law Immigrant Rights ClinicGeorgia Detention WatchHouston Peace and Justice CenterHouston United/UnidosHuman Rights Law Society at the University of Texas School of LawIllinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee RightsImmigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Portland, MEInterfaith Alliance of ColoradoInterfaith Coalition on Immigration, MinnesotaThe Interfaith Center of New YorkIRATE & First Friends, Elizabeth, NJJesuit Social Research Institute/Loyola University New Orleans, LouisianaJewish Community Action, St. Paul, MNLegal Services for Prisoners with Children, San Francisco, CA.NC Immigrant Rights ProjectNew Sanctuary Coalition of New York CityNo More Deaths, Tuscon, AZPeace with Justice Committee of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, MNPeople Organizing in Defense of the Earth and her Resources, Austin, TXPolitical Asylum/Immigration Representation Project, Boston, MAReformed Church of Highland Park, NJReform Immigration for Texas AllianceSan Antonio Immigrant Youth MovementSocial Justice Guild of the First Existentialist Congregation of AtlantaTexas Civil Right ProjectTexas Criminal Justice CoalitionTexas Dream AllianceTexas Indigenous CouncilTexas Jail ProjectUniversity Leadership Initiative, Austin, TXWho is My Neighbor, Inc., Highland Park, NJWilCo Justice Alliance, Williamson County, TexasCC:Kevin LandySteve AntkowiakYasmeen PittsAndrew StraitLindsey ColeAttachments  Family Detention Open Letter 1-10-12.pdfLast modified January 10, 2012The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesSpread the wordTweetShareEmailGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
