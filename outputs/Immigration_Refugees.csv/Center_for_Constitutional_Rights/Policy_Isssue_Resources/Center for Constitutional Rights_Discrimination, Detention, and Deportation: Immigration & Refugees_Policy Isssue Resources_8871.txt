Document production is ongoing.Our Team:Ian HeadIan HeadCo-Counsel Beyond Legal Aid, Latino JusticeClient(s) Immigrant Defense Project, Organizing Communities Against DeportationsJuly 16, 2020Case Description In July 2020, ICE announced it would be holding a "Citizens Academy" in Chicago, Illinois where civilian invitees would be trained in various enforcement techniques used by the law enforcement agency. The inviation promised attendees would engage “in scenario-based training and exercises conducted in a safe and positive environment, including, but not limited to defensive tactics, firearms familiarization, and targeted arrests." Immigrant rights organizations immediately objected to this program and called for it to be canceled. Soon after, it came to light that other components of the agency had operated simialr "Citizens Academies" in past years, dating back to at least 2012.Immigrant Defense Project in New York City and Organizing Communities Against Deportations in Chicago, along with the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a FOIA request to shed light on these programs and get access to training materials and data regarding how ICE runs these "Citizens Academy" programs. When ICE failed to respond, we filed a lawsuit with the help of Beyond Legal Aid to compel the agency to release the documents.This case is part of the Center for Constitutional Rights' Open Records Project and our larger work on behalf of activists and immigrant rights.Case TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersMay 11, 2021Lawsuit filedMay 11, 2021Lawsuit filedWe file a FOIA lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois.Press ReleaseLawsuit Seeks Documents onICE’s “Vigilante Training” ProgramsRelated FilesICE_Citizens_Academy_FOIA_Complaint_051121.pdfJuly 16, 2020FOIA request sent to ICEJuly 16, 2020FOIA request sent to ICEPress ReleaseImmigrant Rights Groups FOIA for Info on ICE’s Chicago Vigilante TrainingRelated FilesOCAD IDP CCR FOIA 7-16-20.pdfLast modified:July 13, 2022Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesDiscriminatory PolicingOpen Records Project: FOIA for the MovementRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
