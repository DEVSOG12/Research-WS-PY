Witte is a federal lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on behalf of 16 medically vulnerable people currently held in six different immigration detention centers in Louisiana. The lawsuit and an accompanying motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) seek the immediate release of these individuals, citing their severe risk of contracting coronavirus and developing life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms as well as ICE’s long and notorious history of failing to address serious overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary facilities, and failure to provide adequate medical care and protection against outbreaks of infectious disease. The complaint and TRO seeking release warn that the near-certainty of coronavirus outbreaks in these facilities renders the continued detention of these individuals a potential death sentence for those detained for only a civil immigration violation.Given the conditions in which people are confined in these immigration detention centers, it is impossible for ICE to comply with CDC guidelines around social distancing, quarantine, and treatment, and the facilities’ already inadequate medical facilities will inevitably be overwhelmed. The plaintiffs themselves report that the detention facilities have provided those detained with little information about coronavirus, including guidelines for preventing it; that they are housed in open dorms with dozens sharing bunk beds only a few feet apart, with only a handful of toilets, showers, and phones; and that staff do not wear masks or gloves. Some of the people being detained do not have access to soap. In the days preceding the case filing, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Louisiana skyrocketed, and the rate of new infections there emerged as the highest in the nation. The filing argues that when a state incarcerates someone, the Due Process Clause of the Constitution mandates the state provide those detained with a basic duty of care and health. Because these plaintiffs are in civil immigration detention, Due Process prohibits imposing conditions of confinement that amount to punishment and also prohibits ICE officials from being “deliberately indifferent” to known medical risks. The TRO likewise argues that release is the only possible remedy given the irremediably dangerous conditions and because access to counsel and to the bond system makes narrower possible relief such as bail impossible. The complaint also alleges that each of the 16 plaintiffs has a disability as defined under the federal Rehabilitation Act and is thus entitled to the only reasonable accommodation imaginable under the circumstances—release. In addition, the complaint highlights the myriad ways ICE is not following—and cannot follow—its own guidelines on containment of communicable diseases, which renders ICE in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. This filing is part of a national effort to release individuals from ICE detention and state and local prisons. Other countries are acting boldly—in the name of justice and public health—to free prisoners. For example, Iran released more than 80,000 prisoners from their jails following the COVID-19 outbreak there. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown into stark relief the inhumanity of the vast detention and incarceration system in the United States, which even under normal circumstances was cruel, dehumanizing, and overcrowded. While this litigation, for now, seeks emergency release only of these particularly vulnerable individuals, it is situated in broader calls for a positive vision of mass decarceration.This case was originally part of a case filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana that covered plaintiffs in facilities in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. After that case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the legal team re-filed this separate case on behalf of the plaintiffs in Louisiana in the district local to the facilities in which they are held, rather than to the ICE field office responsible for the whole region.Case FilesRelease Order Louisiana District Court 19 Petitioners Objections.pdf 18 Respondents Objections and memo attached.pdf Magistrate Judge Report and Recommendation 9 Ps' Reply ISO TRO.pdf Ds Opposition to Motion for TRO1 WDLa Dada petition.complaint.pdf 2-2 WDLa Dada TRO memo.pdf Expert Declaration of Dr. Jaimie Meyer 1 WDLa Dada petition.complaint.pdf 2-2 WDLa Dada TRO memo.pdf Meyer Decl. 8 TRO opp 2020.04.22.pdf 9 Ps' Reply ISO TRO.pdf 17 USDC Revised Report and Recommendation 2020.04.30.pdf 19 Petitioners Objections.pdf 18 Respondents Objections and memo attached.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersMay 22, 2020District court orders release of 14 peopleMay 22, 2020District court orders release of 14 peopleRelated FilesRelease Order Louisiana District CourtMay 4, 2020Both Plaintiff and Defendants file objections to the courts Report and RecommendationMay 4, 2020Both Plaintiff and Defendants file objections to the courts Report and RecommendationRelated Files19 Petitioners Objections.pdf18 Respondents Objections and memo attached.pdfApril 30, 2020Magistrate Judge issues Report and RecommendationApril 30, 2020Magistrate Judge issues Report and RecommendationMagistrate Judge recommends release of 13 of the 15 plaintiffs remaining in custodyRelated FilesMagistrate Judge Report and RecommendationApril 23, 2020Plaintiffs file reply in support of TROApril 23, 2020Plaintiffs file reply in support of TRORelated Files9 Ps' Reply ISO TRO.pdfApril 22, 2020Government files response to TRO motionApril 22, 2020Government files response to TRO motionRelated FilesDs Opposition to Motion for TROApril 14, 2020Plaintiffs file complaint and motion for temporary restraining orderApril 14, 2020Plaintiffs file complaint and motion for temporary restraining orderPress ReleaseMedically Vulnerable Immigrants in Louisiana ICE Facilities File Emergency Petition for ReleaseRelated Files1 WDLa Dada petition.complaint.pdf2-2 WDLa Dada TRO memo.pdfExpert Declaration of Dr. Jaimie MeyerLast modified:October 12, 2020Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesMass IncarcerationRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
