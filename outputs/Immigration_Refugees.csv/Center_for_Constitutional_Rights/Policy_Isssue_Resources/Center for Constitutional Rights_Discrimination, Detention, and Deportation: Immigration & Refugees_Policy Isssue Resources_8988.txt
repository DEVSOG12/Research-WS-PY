Abbasi?January 26, 2017After Trump's executive orders making national policy out of anti-Muslim hate, our Supreme Court case Ziglar v. Abbasi (changed from Turkmen v. Ashcroft in November 2016) could not be more timely or more pressing.  Ziglar v. Abbasi is a civil rights lawsuit filed in 2002 on behalf of a class of Muslim, South Asian, and Arab noncitizens swept up by the INS and FBI in connection with the 9/11 investigation. Based solely on their race, religion, ethnicity, and immigration status, hundreds of men were detained as “terrorism suspects” and held in brutal detention conditions for the many months it took the FBI and CIA to clear them of any connection to terrorism. They were then deported.Trouble seeing the video?
