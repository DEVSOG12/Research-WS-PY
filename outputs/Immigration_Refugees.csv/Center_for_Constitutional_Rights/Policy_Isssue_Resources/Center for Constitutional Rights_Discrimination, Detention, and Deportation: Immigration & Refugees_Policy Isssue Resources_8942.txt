Independent human rights experts regularly review whether governments are in compliance with their human rights obligations. The Center for Constitutional Rights engages with these experts by drafting shadow reports and other advocacy materials, providing testimony, lobbying, and working in coalition with our partners to use these opportunities to highlight serious human rights violations.The Center for Constitutional Rights has played a critical role during periodic reviews of the U.S. government by UN treaty bodies, including those that review the United States’ compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racism (CERD), and during the cumulative Universal Periodic Review (UPR). In addition, the Center for Constitutional Rights advocates before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (the regional rights body for the western hemisphere). 2022 CERD Review Process of the U.S. Government In August 2022, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination will review the U.S. government's compliance with its human rights obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). On May 16, 2022, the Center for Constitutional Rights submitted a List of Themes to inform the committee's review, outlining our key concerns with regard to the laws, policies, and practices that impact racialized communities, including Indigenous, Black, Brown, Muslim, and immigrant communities.2022 List of Themes Submission on Failure to Comply & Refusal to Repair; Organized Abandonment & Environmental Racism; Racist Carceral Logics: Guantánamo, Immigration Detention, and Family Regulation; and Systematic Disenfranchisement: Voting Apartheid and Suppression of Dissent by Indigenous, Black & Palestinian human rights defenders.CCR also contributed to the 2022 review process by authoring the following shadow report:2022 Center for Constitutional Rights report (co-authored with The Descendants Project, Inclusive Louisiana, and Concerned Citizens of St. John Parish) on Environmental Racism and the Desecration of Black History in Louisiana2014 CERD Review Process of the U.S. Government In August 2014, the U.S. Government was reviewed by the UN CERD Committee with regards to its human rights commitments under the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD).
