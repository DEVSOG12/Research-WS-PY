Preska granted in part and denied in part the CIA's and plaintiffs' respective motions for summary judgment. The case against DOJ, DOD, and DOS remains pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and negotiations with those agencies are ongoing.October 24, 2007Case Description CCR, AIUSA and WSLS filed FOIA requests with government agencies seeking the release of records related to the evaluations or authorizations of secret detention and transfer, policies and procedures for such programs, the identities of individuals detained or transferred and the locations of their detention or transfer, the activities of private contractors and non-governmental actors, and injuries and treatment of individuals detained or transferred.Secret prisons and extraordinary rendition hold people outside the law, without contact with lawyers, family members, or the outside world. Reports of torture, abuse, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are common, and these detainees have no recourse for the abuses that they have suffered. Please see our fact sheet on Ghost Detention.Despite the fact that the government has acknowledged the existence of the program, these agencies have continued to withhold documents that are responsive to the FOIA requests.The suit raises several causes of action for violation of the FOIA, including failure to expedite processing of their requests, failure to make the records sought promptly available, failure to timely respond to their requests, failure to release records, failure to allow fee waiver, and the improper withholding of agency records. The suit seeks immediate and expedited processing and release of the records requested.CCR has two related cases. CCR represents Maher Arar, a Canadian victim of the U.S. program of extraordinary rendition who was tortured in Syria for nearly a year. CCR also represents Majid Khan, a former resident of Baltimore, Maryland, who was detained in secret for years before being transferred to Guantánamo Bay.Case FilesComplaint 2010-08-02 Ghost FOIA - CIA Opinion and Order - full.pdf Off the Record: U.S. Responsibility for Enforced Disappearances in the "War on Terror" CIA notice of motion for SJ Jackson Stearns declaration John Hackett declaration Hecker declaration Hecker declaration - Exh A Grafeld declaration Colborn declaration McGuire declaration Dimaio declaration - CIA Dimaio declaration - Exh A1 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh A2 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh A3 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh A4 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh A5 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh A6 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh A7 - CIA docs released Dimaio declaration - Exh B - original CCR FOIA request Dimaio declaration - Exh C - CIA response to FOIA request Dimaio declaration - Exh D - original ACLU FOIA request Dimaio declaration - Exh E - joint 2004 FOIA request Dimaio declaration - Exh F - original Amnesty FOIA request Dimaio declaration - Exh G - original Amnesty FOIA request2Dimaio Declaration - Exh G - original Amnesty FOIA request2 Dimaio Declaration - Exh H - stipulation Dimaio declaration - Exh I Dimaio declaration- Exh J Kammer declaration Kammer declaration - Exh A - decl. of Michael Donley Kammer Declaration - Exh B - 2nd decl. of Michael Donley Memorandum of law in support of CIA motion for SJ Release-in-parts Release - in-parts set A Release - in-parts set B Release - in-parts set C Release - in-parts set D Release - in-parts set E Release - in-parts set F Satterthwaite decl. exhibits HH - NNN Satterthwaite decl. exhibits AA - GG Satterthwaite decl. exhibits A - Z Satterthwaite declaration Opposition and cross motion against the CIA Gutierrez decl. w exhbts Vaughn index chart CIA reply and opposition Daughtry declarationDeMaio declaration Plaintiffs' reply Gutierrez declaration Motion for partial summary judgement by the DOJ and CIA Bradley declaration Bradley declaration Ex A Bradley declaration Ex B Bradley declaration Ex C Hilton declaration Hilton declaration Ex A Pages from Feb. 2009 DOD JS release(1) Pages from Feb. 2009 DOD JS release(2) Pages from Feb 2009 DOD TRANSCOM Release DOD JS release - pg 1-43 DOD JS release - pg 44-164 DOD JS release - pg 165-251 DOD JS release - pg 252-340 DOD JS release - pg 341-425 DOD JS release - pg 426-519 DOD JS release - pg 520-597 DOD JS release - pg 598-715 DOD JS release - pg 716-853 DOD JS release - pg 854-956 DOD JS release - pg 957-1082 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 1-100 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 101-200 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 201-300 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 301-400 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 401-500 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 501-600 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 601-700 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 701-800 DOD TRANSCOM release - pg 801-950 DOS foreign service posts release, p 0001-0036 DOS foreign service posts release, p 0037-0087 DOS foreign service posts release, p 0088-0150 DOS european & eurasian affairs release, p 0001-0064 DOS foreign policy release, p 0007-0061 DOS foreign policy release, p 0062-0066 DOS foreign policy release, p. 0067-0223DOS military affairs release, p. 2009-03-16 DOS PM 0001-0015DOS foreign policy release, p. 0224-0243 DOD - DOJ EOUSA release DOD Office of Inspector General release DOD GTMO release DOD Joint Staff release DOD Office of Secretary of Defense, p 1-100 DOD Office of Secretary of Defense, p 101-200 DOD Office of Secretary of Defense, p 201-300 DOD Office of Secretary of Defense, p 301-400 DOD Office of Secretary of Defense, p 401-552 DOD Undersecretary of Defense for Policy release Order withdrawing previous CIA and DOJ motions.

Preska issues an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the CIA's and plaintiffs’ respective motions for summary judgment. Although upholding the CIA’s withholding of documents on several grounds, Judge Preska also ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in determining that the CIA interpreted the FOIA requests on the specific interrogation technique “attention shake” too narrowly and failed to provide adequate justification for withholding certain legal documents.Related FilesOpinion and OrderMarch 5, 2010CIA reply brief.March 5, 2010CIA reply brief.Related FilesCIA motion for summary judgmentLietzau declarationSecond Hilton declarationSecond Hilton decl. ex.
