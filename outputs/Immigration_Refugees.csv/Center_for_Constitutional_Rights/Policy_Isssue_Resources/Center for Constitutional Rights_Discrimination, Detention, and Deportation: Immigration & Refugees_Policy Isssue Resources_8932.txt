As such, we respectfully urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety.Read our submission here.Attachments  CCR_HRI_Comment-PublicChargeandHR-Final.pdfLearn moreSubmission Regarding the Expansion of the Recognition, Institutionalization, and Accountability Framework for Economic and Social Rights, Focused on Developments in the United StatesOn March 29, 2019, the Center for Constitutional Rights joined with the Human Rights in the U.S. Project of the Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute (HRI) to send a submission to the United...Last modified November 18, 2019The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesRacial InjusticeSpread the wordTweetShareEmailGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
