Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: November 25, 2013Current Status On April 9, 2019, the parties agreed to settle attorneys fees. On October 31, 2017, DWN and CCR reached a settlement on all other aspects of the case.Our Team:Ghita SchwarzCo-Counsel Seton Hall Law ClinicClient(s) Detention Watch NetworkJanuary 17, 2014Case Description In November 2013, the Detention Watch Network (DWN) and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for information and documents pertaining to the so-called "detention bed quota," also known as the "detention bed mandate.” When the agencies failed to comply, CCR filed suit against them. This work is part of  CCR’s support of grassroots immigrants’ rights groups fighting injustice in immigration policing and enforcement, as well as CCR’s long history of work around detention and mass incarceration.Starting in 2009, appropriations bills passed by the U.S. Congress required the funding of at least 34,000 immigration detention beds per day. DHS and ICE interpreted this funding provision as a requirement that those beds be filled at all times, through the use of local jails and correctional facilities as well as private, for-profit correctional corporations with enormous lobbying power, resulting in a quota for detainees that has no parallel or precedent in the U.S. criminal justice system.CCR and DWN filed their FOIA to obtain information that would give the public a better understanding of the detention bed quota, the decision-making surrounding the quota, and its impact on detention policy and detention contracting decisions. The information they received helped enable the public, advocates, and congressional representatives during the Obama administration push for ending the bed quota. CCR and DWN also uncovered information about local "lockup" quotas, and published two reports entitled Banking on Detention, in 2015 and 2016.On April 9, 2019, the parties agreed to settle attorneys fees. On October 31, 2017, DWN and CCR reached a settlement on all other aspects of the case.Case FilesDkt 213 Stip and Order Attorneys Fees 4 9 2019.pdf Dkt 208 Attorneys Fees Order 2 5 2019.pdf 17-64 Brief in Opposition - Final.pdf Dkt 149 - Denial of En Banc CCA.pdf Dkt 150 - Denial of En Banc GEO.pdf DWN Order 2017.2.8.MTD_.pdf Dkt 164 Order Granting in Part Denying in Part Motion for Stay of July 15 2016 Order.pdf Dkt 65-1.Plaintiff-Appellees' Motion to Dismiss.1 29 2016.pdf Dkt 160 Order re Stay and Clarifying July Opinion.pdf Dkt 147 GEO Letter Motion for Stay 10-3-16.pdf Dkt 151 Pls Opposition to Stay.pdf Dkt 146 Notice of Cross Appeal.pdf Dkt 142 GEO CCA Notice of Appeal 9 9 2016.pdf Dkt 141 Op and Order Granting GEO CCA Mot to Intervene 9 2 2016.pdf 2016.7.14.DWN_.v.ICE_.SJ_.opinion.pdf CCR Sur-Reply Memorandum of Law Schwarz Declaration in Support Schwarz Declaration Ex 16 Schwarz Declaration Ex 17 Dkt 104 Def Reply MOL Partial SJ.pdf Dkt 105 Def Reply Partial SJ - Pineiro Decl.pdf Dkt 106 Def Reply Partial SJ - Venturella Decl.pdf Dkt 107 Def Reply Partial SJ - Conry Decl.pdf Government Reply BriefPineiro Declaration Venturella Declaration Conry Declaration Dkt 96 b4 Reply MOL.pdf CCR Reply Brief - Memorandum of Law 1-19-16 12 - 22 - 15 Defs MOL on B4 SJ.pdf Dkt 92.Venturella Declaration on behalf of GEO.pdf Dkt 91.Verhulst CCA Declaration.pdf Dkt 90.Gates & Asset Protection Declaration.pdf Dkt 89.Adams Declaration.pdf Dkt 88.Pineiro Declaration.pdf Dkt 75 b4 SJ Mem of Law 11-17-15.pdf Dkt 75-1 b4 SJ 56.1 Statement 11-17-15.pdf Motion for Partial Summary Judgment - Memorandum of Law Motion for Partial Summary Judgment - 56.1 Statement Order Regarding Pages Defendants Must Review and Produce Each Month (7/3/14) Plaintiffs' Letter Seeking Immediate Production of Documents Order Denying Preliminary Injunction and Setting Document Production Schedule Defendant DHS' Motion to Dismiss (3-5-14) Declaration of Holtzer in Support of Motion to Dismiss (3-5-14) Exhibits to Holtzer Declaration (3-5-14) Plaintiffs' Opposition to Motion to Dismiss (3-28-14) Declaration of Ghita Schwartz in Support of Opposition (3-28-14) Exhibits to Schwartz Declaration (3-28-14) Memorandum of Law in Support of Preliminary Injunction (2-11-14) Declaration of Ghita Schwarz in Support of Preliminary Injunction (2-11-14) Exhibits A-O to Schwarz Declaration (2-11-14) Defendants' Opposition to Preliminary Injunction (3-5-14) Declaration of AUSA Koehler in Support of Defendants' Opposition (3-5-14) Exhibits to Koehler Declaration (3-5-14) Reply Brief to Defendants' Opposition (3-17-14) Declaration in Support of Reply Brief (3-17-14) Exhibits to Reply Brief (3-17-14) FOIA Complaint Defendants' Answer (3-5-14) FOIA Request 2-11-14 Preliminary Injunction~GS Decl Ex H.pdf Plaintiffs' Letter Seeking Immediate Production of Documents 6.18.14.pdf 2-11-14 PI GS Decl Ex A-O.pdf 3-5-14 Kuehler Decl Ex A-F.pdf Reply Decl Ex 1 - 5.pdf 3-5-14 Def Mot to Dismiss - Decl of J Holzer DHS Ex A and B.pdf 3 28 14 DWN Opp Motion Dismiss - Schwarz Decl - Ex 1 - 6.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersApril 9, 2019Stipulation and settlement of attorneys' feesApril 9, 2019Stipulation and settlement of attorneys' feesRelated FilesDkt 213 Stip and Order Attorneys Fees 4 9 2019.pdfFebruary 5, 2019Judge orders government to pay attorneys' fees for private prison contractors' appealFebruary 5, 2019Judge orders government to pay attorneys' fees for private prison contractors' appealRelated FilesDkt 208 Attorneys Fees Order 2 5 2019.pdfOctober 31, 2017Parties reach settlement on document productionsOctober 31, 2017Parties reach settlement on document productionsDWN and CCR reached a settlement with the government regarding document productions in the case.
