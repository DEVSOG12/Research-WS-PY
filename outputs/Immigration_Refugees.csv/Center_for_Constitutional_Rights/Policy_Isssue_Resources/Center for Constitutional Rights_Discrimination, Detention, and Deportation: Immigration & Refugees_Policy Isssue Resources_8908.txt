The complaint is chiefly concerned with reports of physical abuse by ICE employees that clearly violate the ICE/DRO Standards, which expressly prohibit “[s]triking a detainee for failing to obey an order” and “[s]triking a detainee when grasping or pushing him/her would achieve the desired result.” It is also concerned with the retaliatory tactics of ICE employees, such as exhibiting disregard for the needs and conditions of individuals as well as seeking court orders to force-feed them.CCR’s complaint calls for the Obama Administration to enact the overdue changes in ICE to ensure transparency and accountability, including new infrastructure to monitor and address substandard conditions of DHS detention centers. We feel the DHS and the Obama Administration should immediately and thoroughly investigate the hunger strikers’ grievances at PIDC as well as other immigration detention centers throughout Texas.Case FilesCCR LetterCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersJuly 27, 2012DHS wrote to us saying they were still working on compiling information from their investigation.July 27, 2012DHS wrote to us saying they were still working on compiling information from their investigation.May 2, 2010DHS responded saying they were investigating.May 2, 2010DHS responded saying they were investigating.March 31, 2010CCR sent a Letter to DHS regarding the allegations of abuse at the PIDC.March 31, 2010CCR sent a Letter to DHS regarding the allegations of abuse at the PIDC.Related FilesCCR LetterLast modified:September 18, 2012Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesMass IncarcerationGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
