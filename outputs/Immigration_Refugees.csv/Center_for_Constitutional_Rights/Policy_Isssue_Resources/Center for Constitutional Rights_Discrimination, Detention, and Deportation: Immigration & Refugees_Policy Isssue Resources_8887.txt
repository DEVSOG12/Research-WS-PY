Gillis is a federal lawsuit against facility warden Shawn Gillis and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on behalf of four medically vulnerable people currently held at Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi. The lawsuit seeks the immediate release of these individuals, citing their severe risk of contracting coronavirus and developing life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms as well as ICE’s long and notorious history of failing to address serious overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary facilities, and failure to provide adequate medical care and protection against outbreaks of infectious disease. The complaint seeking release warns that the near-certainty of coronavirus outbreaks in this facility renders the continued detention of these individuals a potential death sentence for those detained for nothing more than a civil immigration violation. In addition, a motion for a temporary restraining order seeks immediate widespread and regular testing, a site inspection, and adequate cleaning supplies.Given the conditions in which people are confined in immigration detention centers, it is impossible for ICE to comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines around social distancing, quarantine, and treatment, and the facilities’ already inadequate medical facilities will inevitably be overwhelmed. The plaintiffs report that they are housed in close quarters and in large groups, with shared toilets, showers, and phones that are not adequately cleaned, and that many staff, including medical staff, do not wear masks or gloves. Some of the people being detained do not have consistent access to soap.The filing argues that when a state incarcerates someone, the Due Process Clause of the Constitution mandates the state provide those detained with a basic duty of care and health. Because these plaintiffs are in civil immigration detention, Due Process prohibits imposing conditions of confinement that amount to punishment and also prohibits ICE officials from being “deliberately indifferent” to known medical risks. The complaint also alleges that each of the plaintiffs has a disability as defined under the federal Rehabilitation Act and is thus entitled to the only reasonable accommodation imaginable under the circumstances—release. In addition, the complaint highlights the myriad ways ICE is not following—and cannot follow—its own guidelines on containment of communicable diseases. These failures endanger the lives not only of the human beings they detain but also the mostly rural communities where ICE’s detention centers are located.This filing is part of a national effort to release individuals from ICE detention and state and local prisons. Other countries and some state prison systems are acting more aggressively—in the name of justice and public health—to free prisoners. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown into stark relief the inhumanity of the vast detention and incarceration system in the United States, which even under normal circumstances was cruel, dehumanizing, and overcrowded. While this litigation, for now, seeks relief only for these particularly vulnerable individuals, it is situated in broader calls for a positive vision of mass decarceration.Case FilesDenial of TRO 2020.11.23 Ps' Opp to MTD 2020.10.27 GM.pdf 23.Gonzalez Morales.Gov't MTD.10 13 2020.pdf 25.Gov't Response in Opp to Habeas Petition.10 13 2020_Redacted.pdf Reply in Supp. of Motion for TRO - FILED 10620-1.pdf Morales - TRO Response Govt._Redacted.pdf Morales - TRO Response - Dec in Support-1.pdf Gonzalez Morales - TRO Mem REDACTED.pdf Morales - Complaint REDACTED.pdfCase TimelineNewest FirstOldest FirstFeaturedFilterClear FiltersNovember 23, 2020Judge Bramlette denies plaintiffs motion for a Temporary Restraining Order for widespread testing, halting transfers and a site inspection in Adams County Detention CenterNovember 23, 2020Judge Bramlette denies plaintiffs motion for a Temporary Restraining Order for widespread testing, halting transfers and a site inspection in Adams County Detention CenterRelated FilesDenial of TRO 2020.11.23October 27, 2020Plaintiffs file opposition to government's motion to dismissOctober 27, 2020Plaintiffs file opposition to government's motion to dismissRelated FilesPs' Opp to MTD 2020.10.27 GM.pdfOctober 13, 2020Defendants file reply to complaint and motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdictionOctober 13, 2020Defendants file reply to complaint and motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdictionRelated Files23.Gonzalez Morales.Gov't MTD.10 13 2020.pdf25.Gov't Response in Opp to Habeas Petition.10 13 2020_Redacted.pdfOctober 6, 2020Plaintiffs file reply in support of TROOctober 6, 2020Plaintiffs file reply in support of TRORelated FilesReply in Supp. of Motion for TRO - FILED 10620-1.pdfOctober 2, 2020Defendants file opposition to TROOctober 2, 2020Defendants file opposition to TRORelated FilesMorales - TRO Response Govt._Redacted.pdfMorales - TRO Response - Dec in Support-1.pdfSeptember 17, 2020Plaintiffs file a motion for temporary restraining orderSeptember 17, 2020Plaintiffs file a motion for temporary restraining orderRelated FilesGonzalez Morales - TRO Mem REDACTED.pdfSeptember 16, 2020Complaint filed in Southern District of MississippiSeptember 16, 2020Complaint filed in Southern District of MississippiRelated FilesMorales - Complaint REDACTED.pdfLast modified:December 3, 2020Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesDiscriminatory PolicingRacial InjusticeGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
