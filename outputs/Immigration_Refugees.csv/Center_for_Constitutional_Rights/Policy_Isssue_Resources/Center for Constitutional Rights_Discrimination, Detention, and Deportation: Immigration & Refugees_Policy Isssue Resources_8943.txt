Davis.  Unfortunately, in order to seek their release, each detainee had to formally request that ICE review their custody and grant release under reasonable conditions of supervision.CCR developed a packet of pro se materials to assist Haitian detainees and immigration attorneys in advocating for their release.To download the pro se packet of materials for Haitian Detainees, click on the links below:Instruction Letter for Pro Se Haitian DetaineesCCR Pro Se Habeas Instructions - KreyolLetter to ICE Field Office Director Requesting Release Custody ReviewHabeas Petition for Pro Se Haitian DetaineesHabeas Petition for Pro Se Detainees (Word document of petition only) Last modified May 8, 2015The bigger pictureAbusive Immigration PracticesSpread the wordTweetShareEmailGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
