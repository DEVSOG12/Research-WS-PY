The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutions
Pardiss Kebriaei:
Welcome to the Activist Files The Center For Constitutional Rights Podcast. I'm Pardiss Kebriaei, I'm anattorney here. I'm here with three guests, Faisal Hashmi, Jeanne Theoharis, and Murtaza Hussain. Theywill introduce themselves in a moment, but just by way of introduction into what we're going to betalking about today, I wanted to say a bit about one of CCR's long-time clients. Um, he is Ahmed Abu Ali.He is a 40 year old man who is currently serving a sentence of life without parole in a federal prison andCommunications Management unit in C, Indiana. Ahmed was convicted in 2005 of various terrorismrelated charges, the case against him, the prosecution's entire case against him rested on a forcedconfession that was obtained during a period when he was detained in Saudi Arabia, by the Saudi secretpolice the Mabahith, which is an agency that is notorious for brutal treatment and torture of people inits custody Ahmed also experienced torture under those conditions.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
He made a statement, made a confession that was then admitted into evidence at his trial and used toconvict. There were other violations of his rights as a criminal defendant at his trial. And you can readmore about his case on CCR's website, things like the government's main witnesses were the Saudiinterrogators who obtained this, this forced confession. They were deposed remotely anonymouslyoutside of his, of Ahmed presence. Um, completely undermining his right as a criminal defendant toconfront the witnesses against him. The prosecutor said things to the jury in the presence of the juryand the judge allowed it. Things like this man will, can kill all of you if you don't convict. So due processin his case looked a bit like that. He was convicted despite the fact that there was, as the judge said, inhis sentencing opinion, there was no victim, no actual plot, no actual violence, no leadership role byAhmed only vague allegations of conspiracy.

1
The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsis what he is facing, now in federal prison. He's been in custody, whether in Saudi custody or US custodysince 2003, it's been 18-years of imprisonment and conditions like solitary confinement and for a longtime special administrative measures, which are sort of enhanced solitary, which we'll talk more about.18-years based on a forced confession under those kinds of conditions and a life without parolesentence for a crime with no victim. Ahmed is just one of hundreds of people who's been prosecutedand convicted of terrorism since 9-11. Many of whom are still in prison, some of whom have beenreleased, but are living with the experience of their imprisonment, they and their families and theircommunities. And we're here to talk about these cases because while there's a certain growingunderstanding and has been for a long time of the unfairness and the injustice of the criminal justicesystem at large, broadly, at a certain skepticism and scrutiny questions we ask of other cases when itcomes to this realm of prosecutions in cases, these national security terrorism cases, there has beenover the past 20-years, far less examination and understanding of what actually happens in the contextof due process, what due process looks like and what the impact of these cases is.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
And instead, a dominant narrative has found that the federal courts are in fact where we want to be,and that has been understandable that messaging, because we've been fighting things like Guantanamo,the military detention system there, and things like the military commission system, systems that areovertly, plainly unfair, or where people are being held without charge. So while it is true that we want todismantle and end those systems and we don't want to be there. And maybe the federal courts are theappropriate place to deal with prosecution. Uh, and they are, the analysis and the discussion has sort ofstopped there for many years. It really has not gone further to look underneath conviction, look at howarrests are brought what the nature of charges are, what happens at trial, what the conditions areunder, which people are being held, what the impact of these cases is on the human beings who've beenaffected, on the communities that have been affected.
Pardiss Kebriaei
So that's what we're here to talk about. This realm of work and what actually has happened over thepast 20-years. Uh, and the people here, um, with me today are activists in different ways. Who've beenat the forefront of this work and telling the stories of people who've been prosecuted. Who've beenadvocating for those on the inside, and who've been working to expose and end government abuse inthis realm. So I will stop there and turn to each of you, Faisal, Jeanne and Murtaza. And just ask you tostart with talking a bit about your connection to this work and how you got into it.
Faisal Hashmi:
Sure. I'll begin. My introduction to this work was by circumstance. I have a brother, uh, my brotherFahad was a post 9-11 was an activist in New York city. You know, we're from New York city. And, uh, hewent to Brooklyn college, uh, and he was an activist on behalf of the Muslim community and eventsrelated to the Muslim community. So with that said, he pursued a master's degree after graduating in, inLondon. And when he was pursuing his master's degree, about 2004, the acquaintance of his stayed inhis apartment. And, uh, then left. Fast forward to 2006. After my brother got his master's degree, hewas arrested in England ostensibly on charges that he allowed this acquaintance to stay with him. Andin the acquaintance possession was ponchos and socks and his luggage, which he, this acquaintancewent on to deliver to some unsavory characters. He, my brother was arrested on a charges from theUnited States under the Material Support Paradigm, and basically spent a year in England, contesting hisextradition, and then was brought to America in 2007, uh, and had levied upon him four charges all
2The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsunder the Material Support Paradigm that amounted to 70 years in prison for, uh, allowing this personwho stayed with him, went on to deliver socks and ponchos.
Faisal Hashmi:
That was the case against my brother. And it was a massive hit on our family. It was quite impactful. Itwas a massive hit on our community, right? So he was well-known in the community. And we had, wehad roots in New York city in the outer boroughs. And with that said his case, the outlines of it, the, thedetails of it just seemed, it seemed ridiculous, right? That a person can be facing 70 years in jail forsomebody else's actions. And it wasn't just that aspect of it. Uh, when he came here, he wasimmediately put into solitary confinement and our community and our family, we hired lawyers and hiscase ahead of a trial dragged on for three years where he was in solitary confinement in some of theworst conditions in a prison called MCC, which is being shut down for its conditions right now in 23hours of solitary confinement, video monitored.
Faisal Hashmi:
On top of that, he had very limited access to his family visitation to his family. And this is all pre-trialahead of any decision on his case. And it, it basically demonstrated to the larger Muslim community, thepitfalls of the judicial system, right? That it is an unfair judicial system. It is a harsh judicial system. Ittortures by subjecting people to solitary confinement. It tortures by denying them access to theirfamilies. And we saw that happening in real time, him being impacted by these conditions on top ofthat, as Pardiss had mentioned, there were some special administrative measures. My brother was a, anacademic. He had never been in trouble in his life. And the attorney general of the United States, threeattorney generals in the United States, subsequently levied special administrative measures, which areextreme measures to limit the, of a person from their lawyer or from their lawyer communicating out totheir firm, to their family.
Faisal Hashmi:
So it seemed like every school you was used to stack the system. So with that said there was, uh, hisfriends, his family supporters coalesced around his case to bring attention to the case, his conditions ofconfinement, what turned out to be the evidence being secret evidence that he wasn't even allowed tosee his communication being limited, his lawyer's communication being limited. So there were so manyaspects of his case that highlighted the inherent injustice of the judicial system, the federal judicialsystem, uh, and, you know, ahead of his trial, a full four years later, my brother took a plea to one countinstead of facing 70 years, it amounted to about 15 years in prison. And subsequently he was moved tothe super maximum security prison in Colorado, where he served his time there. And at theCommunication Management Unit in Terra Haute. With that said, he spent another three years in thesuper maximum security prison, further solitary confinement altogether, about six years of solitaryconfinement, uh, 13 years altogether in prison, again, a devastating impact on the community, adevastating impact on my family, our extended family.
Faisal Hashmi:
And it just outside of this impact, it kind of, it was different in that there was a lot of, uh, organizingaround his case. A lot of analysis of his case, a lot of visibility of his case where people started looking atthe federal system and being subjected to these terrorism charges, uh, in a more grand view and in amore detailed view. And it became obvious to, uh, to people that something seriously wrong with thissystem and the way to handle things. And he was amongst many people, hundreds of people as Pardiss
3The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsmentioned that were subjected to these types of cases.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
Thanks so much Faisal. Jeannene, you wanna jump in?
Jeanne Theoharis:
Yeah. So in some sense, I pick up the story that Faisal just laid out for us. I'm a professor at Brooklyncollege, and I had Fahad as a student. He does his senior seminar with me. I then write him a letter to goto grad school and send him on his way. And then fast forward a couple years, as Faisal was just saying,and huge headlines across the city, homegrown terrorist has been arrested, uh, in, at Heathrow. So thecase is like, you know, one of these cases that ends up on the front page, um, and at the time atBrooklyn college, we're told to, don't say anything, don't talk to the media, the case, the outlines of it,you know, Al-Qaeda Quartermaster, these kinds of languages. So I have to say, I put it out of my mindand don't really think about it for another year.
Jeanne Theoharis:
And then as Faisal saying, uh, Fahad loses his extra- he, he tries to prevent his extradition and he loses,and he comes to the United States and a colleague who'd also had, Fahad asks me about the case andasked me, what do I think is, you know, had I heard anything, uh, in part, because as Faisal wasmentioning Fahad was, um, at this point, probably one of the most politically active, if not the mostpolitically active, religiously conservative Muslim student I'd had. Uh, and again, we'll, we'll see agrowing political community at Brooklyn college, but at this point, Fahad was very unusual in ourstudent body. And I am a scholar of the black freedom struggle. And so as I started to kind of read aboutthe case and think about the case, it's not sitting right with me because it seemed like maybe we couldnot divorce his much more outspoken, both religiosity and politics.
Jeanne Theoharis:
And so I do something I've never done before or since which is that I reach out to the lawyer to kind ofget a sense of the case and what it is. And I have to say at this point, like most people, right, we arecommitted civil rights, civil liberties, people are spending their energy is in the system that's beingcreated with the military commissions at Guantanamo. And this idea that the United States had createdthis whole shadow system to be able to treat people different, to be able to like limit their rights incourt. And, and so as I start to look at Fahad's case, one of the things that I realized is that even thoughthere's this shadow system, that's predicated on the fact that they have to do this because you, becausethe courts are so open and fair, in fact, what's happened at Guantanamo has a parallel to what'shappened here in the United States.
Jeanne Theoharis:
And at this, I mean, I think the other, what we're seeing also is, even though there's no attention tothese national security places, certainly, you know, by 2007, 2008, we are seeing people really startingto scrutinize the criminal justice system. Um, and the ways that the way we imagine the criminal justicesystem to work, isn't actually the way the criminal justice system works. Because I think in, particularlyin these national security cases, part of the whole rationale, the way we were talking aboutGuantanamo was this idea that the judge would reign in the government that maybe the governmentwas overstepping, particularly in the aftermath of 9-11, but the, the beauty of the federal system wasthat the court would then rein it in. Right. And I think one of the things as I start to look at Fahad's case,
4The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsand then increasingly at other cases, is this is not actually true.
Jeanne Theoharis:
Andsosomeofthethingsthatwemightthinkajudgewouldstepinonliketheuseofprolongedsolitaryconfinementbeforetrial,inthatthewaysthatcompromisesaperson'sabilitytoparticipateintheirowndefense,thewaysthatitcompromisestheirmentalhealth,thewaysthatit'spredicatedonconductthathas not been proven, right. Uh, things like the use of classified evidence, right? So in the 1980s toprosecute US intelligence officers who were spying for the Soviet Union, they introduced this law calledthe Classified Information Procedures Act, which allows the government to, because one of the thingsthat people who were spies would often do is threaten to like reveal classified evidence in court. Butafter 9-11, this law gets used to classify, not people who actually have any knowledge of US intelligence,but in, in these sort of highly high stakes terrorism cases.
Jeanne Theoharis:
And so again, that, um, the evidence and one of the things I want to mention is that Faisal didn'tunderline is that Fahad is a US citizen, right? And so what we imagined to be the rights of us citizens, uh,don't seem to be applying here. And so again, I, I sit with it and after a while, I write a piece for TheNation, um, basically outlining sort of for Fahad's case, but also the kind of larger kind of context ofwhat's happening in the federal system, including Material Support, including the use of classifiedevidence, including the use of pre-trial solitary confinement. Um, and that begins a kind of both anexpiration for me personally, as a scholar and an activist, but also begins, I think, a growing attention tokind of what's happening in the federal system and the kind of local activists' movement then kind ofcomes up again, both around the specifics of the Fahad's case, but also to kind of like to say, okay, wehave to be focusing on closing Guantanamo.
Jeanne Theoharis:
And again, now we're in the Obama administration and Obama comes in saying we're going to closeGuantanamo. And so part of what this kind of growing organizing is saying is that's not enough that wecan't just look there. We have to look what's happening within the federal system. And we have to kindof challenge this idea of a kind of open and fair federal system. So that's really where I come into this.And again, both as an activist and a scholar.
Pardiss Kebriaei (16:48):
Thank you, Jane. We're going to talk more about the organizing and everything that was tried anddone.  Murtaza.
Murtaza Hussain:
Yeah. Murtaza Hussain, I'm a reporter for the Intercept, the National Security Reporter. And I came tothe subject a bit differently. I came at it from a reporting perspective, but I did have a personal interestin, or something that peaked my interest in the subject because obviously everyone who grew up post9-11, or who was quite young when 9-11 happened, there was a very big shift in American popularculture and political culture and the judicial system. And in the years after that, you know, there weremany arrests of cases. Uh, they started becoming a steady drum beat of the arrest of cases. People mayforget, have forgotten this period as being forgotten now, but, uh, you know, every week or so therewere some more month or so there was some plot foiled in some part of the country, or some group ofmen or individual young men who were arrested on, uh, assessable terrorism charges.
5The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutions
Murtaza Hussain:
It was very interesting at the time because there was the suggestion by law enforcement as a result wasthat the United States was full of terrorists. And there were all these plots are being foiled and therewas political pressure and incentive on the part of the law enforcement agents and political figures togenerate these cases or to generate as many as possible. And the couple of cases really stuck in mymind, including [inaudible] case, but there are many, many more. And I think, especially in the firstcouple of years after 9-11, there was just a flood of cases, which would even by the standards of today,which are by no means pristine, there were particularly egregious prosecutions and arrests and a stingsting operations and sensible plots world. So, you know, this year, the years had passed and then I gotinto journalism later, maybe a decade or so after 9-11, and I was doing foreign policy coverage.
Murtaza Hussain:
But then, you know, we started looking back at some of these cases from that period, including onAshley's case. And there were many, you know, glaring irregularities. And then when the actual event of9-11 and the intense changes it wrought on the United States start to disappear. We can look at thesecases, somewhat soberly, and they'll just shocking. Many of them knew their cases. I'll take oneillustrate. One to talk about a lot was the Fort Dix Five case, say a prosecution of a group of young men,including three Albanian brothers in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was led by Chris Christie, who was atthat time, the, uh, uh, attorney general for New Jersey. And, you know, it was a case where theseinformants had basically infiltrated a community. They had no specific criminal plot. They were lookingfor, it was just a fishing expedition and they were paid a lot of money and they were given a lot ofincentives, immigration wise, and legal, otherwise in criminal cases, you know, to generate a case in thishand, on this part.
Murtaza Hussain:
So, but 18 months, they investigated this case and, you know, they ended up charging the gentlemanwith the terrorism. Well, there was no plot. There was no connection to foreign terrorist groups. Therewas no, uh, the judge at the trial acknowledged that they can take know about any terrorism case, aninformant who we later found and filmed or did a documentary with. He told us that, "I told the FBIagents, again, again, there was no case there. These guys are not guilty of anything. And they said, 'don'tworry about it. Just keep, uh, just keep recording them.'" And at the trial, the judge actually said that,that there's not any direct evidence of your involvement. This plot did not bother the jury and does notbother me either for something that's life in prison. So, you know, I just bring up that example becauseit's just one of hundreds of hundreds of cases, which took place in the US and those are specifically casesthat were charged with terrorism.
Murtaza Hussain:
There are other cases, people were basically accused of being terrorists, but charge other things and bethose cases that even are more under the radar than the one that we're discussing right now. But, youknow, it was, it was sort of like, there's two reasons to focus on this. And I think that there's still, it bearscontinued focus going forward. Number one, you know, it's kind of like, it's like a very easy pickings for,if you want to see how the justice system can be in its most egregious and most unjust form. Uh, youlook at those cases in that first decade after 9-11 and even cases today, which are, there's been someimprovement in my opinion, but it's still many, many bad cases that have take place. And thenimprovements come because of all the scrutiny and pressure, which has built in the years since there
6The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsare always terrible cases which bear review when people are still in jail for, or if they're not still in jail,they, you know, the criminalized been ruined by the experience of that happening.
Murtaza Hussain:
So I think reporters everywhere their interest to look at these cases again. And secondly, you know,without, uh, going back over the history of this period, a very false history will be embedded of whatactually took place in the US post 9-11. It will be that the FBI successfully stopped dozens, more attacksof mass-casualty tax or prospective 9-11 by arresting these hundreds of people. And that's just not whathappened. That's not the story of what took place. And of course the 9-11 hijackers were not us citizensor residents, either. The people who wound up in these cases were often on very flimsy pretext. Theywere subjected to, by proxy, the nation's anger over 9-11 was taken out on them. And, you know, inmany cases they had nothing to do with anything even remotely to do with terrorism or internationalpolitics, even, they were just very ordinary people living in United States who happened to have be thewrong skin, color name or religion after 9-11.
Murtaza Hussain:
So I continue to report on these cases, you know, going here's the historical ones and thencontemporary ones, because there was, there's been a lull now, I think, but then there was a pickup incases similar to this with the ISIS era. So when the US had the conflict with ISIS, there were many, manycases arrests, several hundred, again, ISIS cases. I think those cases will be different in some sense,because it's just a very subtle difference because ISIS and Al-Qaeda were different. Al-Qaeda was thetypical thing you accuse people of being associated with post 9-11, and now ISIS people. I find that, uh,the cases post 9-11, there was concerted attempt to attack very educated, or you could say like elitepeople of the Muslim community, United States. Charities, academics, business people who had a lot ofmoney and were philanthropists, things like that.
Murtaza Hussain:
In ISIS cases, I find that they really target another group of people who were very vulnerable becausethere, and in many cases, you know, they have mental illness or they have drug problems, or they eitherhave [inaudible] other ways. Um, so the, the other side of the spectrum of, you know, Muslimcommunity and not all of them are immigrants. Many of them are white Americans or black Americans.And, you know, they are very susceptible to being encouraged to, you know, susceptible to the, theprompts of informants because they have no way of, uh, guarding against that. And they may be on theverge of being in the criminal justice anyways. And, you know, there are statistics of, you know, Xnumber of ISIS cases, foiled post 9-11. And the thing that really frustrates me and frustrated me aboutprevious generation cases and still, and why I think that it's important for substantive journalism to takeplace.
Murtaza Hussain:
And of course, also the efforts of activists and groups like CCR is that the vast majority of these cases,there's a criminal complaint and there's a press release that goes out about these cases. And it says that,you know, ISIS plot was foiled in Ohio and, uh, you know, the FBI successfully did this and that, andcongratulations, we can move on. And what you find is that the vast majority reporting about thesecases is actually just a rewrite of the press release. So reporters take a press release, they rewrite it witha little bit of context, or maybe not as much context, and that's the story goes out and there's not reallyany follow-up or digging into it. What I've found is actually, if you do two things, you should read the
7The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionscomplaint that you read the itomization of what the government alleges happens.
Murtaza Hussain:
So often it doesn't live up to the press, their own press release. And it's actually very oftentimes verytroubling. You know, informant was the one who initiated the plot or the gentleman, or the womantried to back out of the plot with money. He was offered something that something like this nevermakes the news never makes the public consciousness of what the case was. Uh, that's that, and thenyou got to talk to the lawyers and that's the government side of the story still, but you can talk to thelawyers, you can talk to the people involved, you can do the bare minimum investigative work tounderstand what happened here. And it's very, very rare that it all mainly just falls apart, the entirepremise and the entire political depiction of what took place completely falls apart. If you look at FahadHashmi's case, it's also a good example.
Murtaza Hussain:
Like, you know, it was reported as Jeannene said, Al-Qaeda, Quartermaster, or a facilitator in the UnitedStates sounds terrifying. It sounds like a very serious, serious accusation. And of course it scares peopleoff too. It scares people off looking into too deeply because no one wants to be accused of sympathywith the an Al-Qaeda, Quartermaster, whatever that means. But you know, the, the packaging or themarketing of these cases just simply does not live up to what the reality of them is in the vast majority ofcases. But unfortunately the way that things are happening in the United States, there's a lot of politicalincentive and career incentive for law enforcement agents and politicians to trumpet these cases andmake them seem as big and as consequential as possible. I mentioned the Fort Dix Five case ChrisChristie was involved in that case. You know, Chris Christie, of course later went on to be a governor,went on to pretty successful national political career.
Murtaza Hussain:
He's quite famous now as a politician. And he continues to trumpet his success in that case, foiling thisostensible terrorist plot as one of the crown achievements of his career. And, uh, you know, it's just, it'snot reality. Like I think that the importance of paying attention, these cases is you want to discern realityfrom fantasy in very serious way, which impacts a lot of people's lives. Uh, you can take a look at thesecases. It reminds me, i was thinking about this yesterday... It reminds me not say there's not been anysuccessful terrorism, actual terrorism platform in the United States, there have been a few, but the vastmajority of them, it reminds me from the Soviet union or in China during the great accord, there will bedirectives coming from the central government that we need to have X tons of steel or wheat, uh,produced per year.
Murtaza Hussain:
If you look at the FBI directors per year, there there've been years where they had directives to have Xnumber of terrorism plots for that year. And if the supply of terrorism plots cannot meet the demandsomething has to give here and something has to, uh, you need to generate the cases to, uh, to meetthe supply and the people who don't want to do that from a structural standpoint, inside the FBI who,you know, they want to actually combat crime and terrorism, which is legitimate, but, you know, theydon't do it if they don't generate cases, they'll fall behind their career. And the people who are the oneswho are willing to generate cases that are borderline or over the line in sense of not being legitimate,uh, those people will meet their metrics and they'll succeed and, you know, absent a great deal ofscrutiny on the individual cases here, you know, they will just give it to happening again and again.
8The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutions
Murtaza Hussain :
And unfortunately I've seen that in the media, there has continued to be the overwhelming majority ofpeople in the media are not, they don't have no desire or the reticent to, or they believe that whatwhat's being told to them by these press releases and other script released by the FBI, DOJ, they don'tinterpret the cases very closely and during ISIS era. There was a lot of fear and anger, understandably, insome sense, but you know, if you're a journalist or if you're a lawyer, or if you're a judge or you're an FBIagent, you have to, the whole job is to look at these things soberly. And, uh, without the, you know, theheat of emotion and understanding that unpacking this rationally, there's no it's just not done. So, youknow, my interest in these cases is because I would like to see people who would not you'll the crimesor not go to jail.
Murtaza Hussain:
That's, you know, the interest of justice, but also it's just very interesting from a societal perspective,how does this happen? How do all these people go to jail, how was somebody who was in jail fordecades, he's going to be in jail for decades, a quarter of his life having suffered great torture and allthese other terrible things have occurred to him. And as he said, there's no victim here. There's nonothing happened. Like those people who committed heinous murders and rapes and other terriblecrimes and who go to jail for less time than him. And the Fort Dix Five people and many, many others. Sowhat is it about this accusation that allows a sort of exceptional cruelty and, uh, punitive behavior takeplace in cases? I think that by understanding them, you can understand a lot more about how lifefunctions in the United States today for people in the margins.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
Thank you so much, Murtaza and all of you, um, there's so much to unpack. I, I want to, I guess, justpicking up on things you all said, part of what we wanted to do here was sort of highlight specific cases,but also put this in context of sort of the broader arc of what's happened in the patterns across cases.And I think you all talked about that, but, you know, the Material Support vessel like the one that Fahadwas charged with. That, and I'm going to refer to a database on the Intercept's website, Trial and Terror,which I think does a great job, but Trevor Aaronson does a great job of sort of compiling the data onthese cases. And if you look at prosecution since 9-11, the majority over half, I think have had involvedMaterial Support charges, which is just under a federal statute, a broad catch-all charge that sweeps inthings like Material Support to a designated foreign terrorist organization can look like what happenedat the Fahad's case, which is storing luggage in your apartment for two weeks.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
That was then allegedly delivered to a, to a member of Al-Qaeda. I mean, that has constituted MaterialSupport another person Tarik Mahana. I mean, these legacy cases that we're talking about from the firstdecade after 9-11, these are people who are still many of whom are still serving time in prison, TarikMahana, you know, Material Support for translating a document that was then allegedly provided to AlQaeda. So conduct that was very much on the border of protected first amendment activity orassociation. The stings Murtaza that you were talking about. That's also on the use of informants hasalso figured prominently in these cases. So like a third, I'm thinking of a stat looking to this database,again, the Trial and Terror database than a third of these cases have involved stings the use ofinformants who have in many ways manufactured or prodded people along to the point of, you know,um, unrest.
9The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutions
Pardiss Kebriaei:
There are certain of these aggregious cases that we can. We talked about some of them like the Fort DixFive case, the Newburgh Four is another, another sort of outrageous case in later years. I mean, I feellike when I was looking at what happened when ISIS came into the picture in 2014, 15, thoseprosecutions were just run of the mill cases where just the use of informants, you would find someoneonline, who was looking up certain material relating to ISIS and would the befriend, the person, andthen eventually over time and building this relationship, get them to, for example, buy a plane ticket, togo to travel to the region Syria, or, or any country in the region. And that con- that then the arresthappened at the airport. I mean, that constituted Material Support, there were dozens of those cases ofmostly young people, you know, people in their late teens, early twenties who were prodded along,pushed along by informants who found them online, I guess that's just to say, you know, we've talkedabout specific cases, but the sort of buckets of Material Support and the sting operations usinginformatnts have, have constituted the majority of these cases.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
Um, can we turn now to... Murtaza that you were saying there's still like among the media, you know,it's still hard to get people to really interrogate these cases and really examine them. And I guess Iwanted to turn to the organizing and the work that was done to try to change the narrative exposewhat's happening both by reporters like you and Jeanne to the organizing you've been involved in andFaisal around Fahad's case. Can you talk about, um, yeah. W what, what made it so hard and why does itcontinue to be hard? Um, why is there this strange disconnect between the way we understand thecriminal justice system, the court system, when it comes to criminal cases and this totally differentunderstanding or desire to look past conviction when it comes to national security or terrorism?
Murtaza Hussain:
It's a good question. I think it's the heavy politicization of the issue and the media not to blame it onthe  media, but, you know, there's like they've turned this issue into such a sensational, unbelievably,the  most sensational issue in the United States that word terrorism or terrorist has a talismanic powernow  effectively when it's applied to somebody. And then it's like, nobody wants to touch them. I'll givean  example, the fort Dix five case too, at the time when the allegations were made, not to name anyspecific organizations, but organizations that you will not expect, they sort of sided with the FBI in theinitial wake of the, they assume that the, uh, accusations were true. And they were under a lot ofpolitical pressure at the time. And, you know, they were associated with the Muslim community in theUnited States, and now they're usually a bit different, but, uh, even at the time they just said that, youknow, we're sorry this happened.
Murtaza Hussain:
Or, you know, we condemn this and so forth. And I think that speaks to, you know, people being on onehand, very afraid of these cases and the other hand, people who were pursuing them, it's sort of likeexciting or something, or it's sort of a, it's a great career boon for a lot of people. It's great coverage forthe media. They got a lot of mileage out of the case. The FBI likes to impress upon the public that therewas no in many press, press releases that say this or many statements that DOJ says is that there wasnever any danger to the public. When they see this, when the announcement of these arrests, which itwas never any danger to the public, what was the actual serious thing that was taking place? There, it's abit of a curious statement. And, you know, unfortunately there's a lot of the short memory in the media
10The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionstoo.
Murtaza Hussain:
I, I'm not say that things are not don't change or things are not learned in this accumulative process ofknowledge that takes place. I think there's a lot of more appreciation now, at least as possible that manycases, terrorism or bogus, that's the thing that people accept to be the case. And I think that a lot ofreporting and a few books like Trevor errands, Erickson's book, the Terror Factory, and many, manyother individual pieces have been written that sort of help the public understand that these cases oftenhave shortcomings in them, but there's like the normative response. When, you know, when somethinghappened in the broader political context is very heightened or very, uh, very hostile and very excited.Uh, you can say in ISIS era, people were very upset about ISIS was foreign terrorist group carried off, afew terrorist attacks in the, around the world.
Murtaza Hussain:
And at that time, the anger and excitement was so much that there was very limited appetite toquestion these cases at first, and it started to change a bit because some of them were just so over theline that people could see that something was not adding up here, but it's a constant battle because,you know, for every skeptical story, or story, which actually bothers to interrogate the facts, or at leastmake a few phone calls, understand what happened here. Even read the government's chargingdocuments, which is amazingly reporters don't do, uh, the vast majority, you know, there are manycases of people won't do that. The vast majority of local news coverage or national coverage is simplyrestatement of the government's facts and then very, very little interrogation. And beyond that, and as aresult, people still have. I think that if it happened again, if there was another, God forbid, anotherterrorist attack in United States, and there are more cases like this. It would be maybe as bad as post 9-11 exactly. But you know, many of the same, uh, same, uh, pathologies still exist there and would resultin, I think a lot of innocent people were in jail for a long time, uh, simply because the system is set up toproduce that and incentivize that.
Jeanne Theoharis:
Jeanne, can you talk about from an organizing perspective, what was hard, what the challenges wereand continues to be? Yeah, I mean, I think so we're at this 20 year anniversary and, uh, when people arethrowing around words like self-reflection and self-criticism, and, and I think what made it extremelyhard at first, and I agree with Murtaza that part of it was just the media just unwillingness to like, again,one of the things I don't love about the media as a kind of both sides-ism that they sometimes engagein, but I mean, there was no, there, there was never even the notion that there might be like, you haveto have a there's, there might be another side of this. So I think that's a problem, but I think one of theother key barriers was kind of the ways that civil libertarians, human rights groups, civil liberties groupshad constructed this narrative around their advocacy around Guantanamo that rested on the kind ofopenness and fairness of the Federal system.
Jeanne Theoharis:
That was very much about like, you know, that in some sense, even as other parts of their work wasbeing critical of the injustices of the criminal justice system, this incredible siloing. So nobody, almostnobody really doing work on, you know, taking the criminal justice stuff into the national securitycontext. And so part of what made it really difficult at first was the ways that it was so hard to get bothmedia coverage, but also kind of civil rights and civil liberties groups to, to see this aspect of the
1 1The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsproblem. And I think this goes back a little bit to about Murtaza was saying like, nobody wanted to be,and there've been by this point managed to be a carve out in terms of like, you could be advocating forGuantanamo. That didn't mean you what you want to be supporting terrorists. But it was interesting inthe federal system, there was still this, like, because of this idea that there was like a judge that wasgoing to be an arbiter, you know, that the notion that there might need to be advocacy in these cases,that there might need to be political campaign to sort of bring scrutiny on.
Jeanne Theoharis:
This just was really difficult. And so in many ways, the movement started through kind of grassrootspeople coming out of coming out of the peace community, coming out of certainly a civil rightscommunity who similar to, again, my politicisation around this sort of, we're all of a sudden surprised, Ithink that this was happening right here under our noses. Uh, and I think, but it's this very grassrootsmovement. And again, it's getting like, um, like no real attention or coverage for years. Right. And so, soit's a very, it's a, it's a lonely, uh, thing for awhile. Right. And, and it starts to pick up steam, but still like, Ihave this crazy moment, right. A few years ago when Jeffrey Epstein kills himself at MCC. And then thislike flood of reporters. I mean, they're calling, they're writing. They're like, you know, because I'd doneall this work on MCC.
Jeanne Theoharis:AndIwaslike,westoodoutsideofMCCforyearstryingtoshinealightonthis.Andwereachedout,IsatwiththeNewYorktimes,somanytimestryingtobelike,thisisatorturesiteunderyournoseandwith so many different reporters there. And, and then when Jeffrey Epstein kills himself, it's just like, itwas crazy. And so again, I think it's, I think there was this mythology that we bought in, we bought into, Ithink there was the siloing. Right. And so I think that also got in the way, uh, and I think there was fearabout being associated with terrorists and yeah. So I think those are some of the barriers.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
Faisal, I don't know if there's anything you want to add as from like a community perspective.
Faisal Hashmi:
Yeah. I was thinking about that. We have a few Muslim-oriented, civil liberties, civil rights organizations,very high profile in our communities. And for the most part, these organizations are abject failurestowards the community, right. They've basically done a disservice to the community because they'resupposed to be organizations that protect civil liberties, civil rights, they're supposed to be organizationsthat would want to stand up for things like, you know, don't torture people. That's not what happened.What we saw was an embrace of like a patriotism from these organizations, right. Uh, they wrappedthemselves in our, in a flag and these are, you know, somewhat mainstream, uh, organizations and, uh,you know, at a personal level, I just, I've been utterly disappointed by them. One organization, uh, gaveEric Holder about 11 years ago, their man of the year, as he's signing off and overseeing theseprosecutions right in San Francisco, his organization's based out of it's a, you know, there's a lot ofthings that are failures within our own communities on their own, especially the Muslim and theirperspective on these things.
Faisal Hashmi:
They're not, you know, a rational perspective. They're not a perspective based on justice and fairtreatment. These organizations prop themselves up as ostensibly. We are the champions of it, but their
12The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsactions didn't really support their rhetoric in any shape or form. I spoke to them at a personal level. Isaw their actions. And for the most part, they continue to be, you know, failing-type organizations fromthe community. I don't have much respect for them. I have great deal of respect for CCR and, uh, youknow, uh, ACLU National Security Division, because, you know, they put into practice, right? Uh, the,these, these lofty goals of upholding justice, getting human beings, fair treatment. I didn't see it withinour own community. You know, when it becomes, okay, I saw some of these organizations jump onbandwagons, but they, they suck the money out of the community saying yeah we'll champion, youknow, these causes we're going to protect, but they don't.
Faisal Hashmi:
They're, you know, they're failures. A legal fund that that is out there and starts organizing around thesecases. I know their machinations and, you know, it doesn't even in their defense of people, for the mostpart, they become failures. They decide what the safe cases are. And I think there's a lot of that, thatthat has to be understood and analyzed. And again, I'm speaking as speaking from very personalperspective, at some point, there's going to be a, a toll or an analysis of, of, of these events and theseorganizations on this, in this era, a very dark era of our existence here.
Pardiss Kebriaei:That's the, when you said this, the safe cases sort of brought me to what I want to ask you guys next.And I think we're, we've been talking for awhile. So, um, maybe we can end with, with this question, butyou know, in a lot of these cases, we're not talking about innocence, you know, factual innocence wherethe problems are. I mean, in a lot of cases we are, but in other cases, we're talking about thedisproportionate punishment, this the prison time people are getting for the actual conduct they'rebeing charged with. We're talking about conditions in which they're being held at totally underminetheir right to a defense and post-conviction constitute torture. So, you know, these are harder cases,right? In some ways, because it's not, they're not the sort of low hanging fruit or whatever people callthose things. Can you guys talk about why it matters? I mean, for, in terms of the broader movementand conversation around decarceration and even abolition, why do these cases matter? I mean, theyobviously matter because of the people inside their families or communities, the human impact and theimportance of exposing abuse, wherever it occurs, but the broader, bigger picture, I guess, for workbeing done to rethink and transform the prison industrial complex and the criminal justice system, howdo these cases fit in and why is it important to be doing this work and talking about these cases anddoing this advocacy?
Murtaza Hussain:
I think the post 9-11 era, the US law enforcement response domestically, it created a template for howfuture political crises maybe emanated from different communities could be dealt with. And this hasbeen a legal infrastructure and a national security infrastructure surveillance and legal precedents to setin these very extreme precedents set in these, uh, in these years that, you know, it could be turning asother people in the future. And, you know, oftentimes I've made this point that historically, when acountry becomes authoritarian, the authoritarian start authoritarianism begins not by targeting themajority community targets, some unpopular, you know, small minority, and then, but then theprecedent begins there. And then the skills and practices are developed on those back community. So,you know, there's all these cases. And there's as mentioned these cases of people who were completelyinnocent, people who were the more difficult cases you could say, which there were some sort of grayzone or ambiguity, but the thing is in the United States, you know, we have a justice system where, youknow, we don't say that someone commits a murder.
13The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutions
Murtaza Hussain:
Then fortunately, sometimes the people who are very, very punitive with the principles that such thatthere are people who are cast out of humanity, but committing some certain crime or so forth. Andthere's no reason why the terrorism, uh, allegation should necessarily be different than that. People, ifthey committed a crime, which is a serious crime, they should punish according to the very wellarticulated means we have for responding to crime. Historically, we create a category of exceptionwhere even if someone does not commit the crime or there's some ambiguity about it, or they may bethis type of person, then all the legal rule books go out the window. And, you know, you go, you haveprison camps, extra-judicial prison camps, and so forth, people in jail. For many, many years, I chargepreemptive prosecutions, uh, you know, the use of these things and so forth, generate cases out ofnowhere, getting people who are considered undesirables, quote unquote, just off the streets, it's verytotalitarian and authoritarian behavior in miniature.
Murtaza Hussain:
And there's no reason now that it hasn't happened in miniature, that could happen in more broadly.And, uh, you know, we could see that going forward, politics, all shifts, you know, Muslims post 9-11 andMuslim Americans were very much on the dock and they suffered a lot for that reason from the justicesystem. But, you know, in the future, it'll be somebody else and it passed. It was somebody else too. Youknow, I say that, I tell people that it's important for the moral aspect because you know, everyone, everyindividual person deserves a fair shot. They deserve justice and they deserve their fate to be weighedaccording to their actual actions. And, uh, what took place, whether, you know, whether it's completelyinnocence or partial innocence or something like that, that does not, uh, they're not the people just castout of humanity for, because they're using something.
Murtaza Hussain:
But secondly, it's, people's, self-interest, people's self interested defense thing that belongs to all of us,which is, you know, the rule of law in the United States intended to protect every single person in thiscountry, regardless of where their life takes them, where they are. And the degradation of that, youknow, it's maybe suffered by certain people. And so people's families too at one time point in time, butwhen it's degraded, others will suffer in the future. So I think it's a, it's a reasonable case for self-interestthat people should pay attention to these cases and to continue to scrutinize them and not allow, youknow, the extremely punitive and the unfair practices to be an entrenched with our challenge.
Jeanne Theoharis:
Um, I guess I wanted to say two things. One is not an answer to your question, but it kind of goes backto the previous question, which is, I think part of what we need to be scrutinizing here. Um, and one ofthe things we've seen in the past few weeks around the war in Afghanistan is finally some numbersabout how much we spent on that. And I think there is no way to understand where these cases comefrom from the political economy of kind of what happens after 9-11 to kind of particularly domestic lawenforcement. And it's just a, like, you know, it's an explosion of domestic law enforcement and anexplosion of money. And I think we, we haven't yet seen the kind of research in journalism because it'sso hard to get these numbers of just how much money it was is, but in order to justify that kind ofbudget, and even from what we know, like, so the FBI, most of its budget, you know, in the years after 9-11 is going to go towards national, you know, domestic national security stuff, but to justify that right,part of where these cases become so crucial is to sort of say, look, we're preventing things.
14The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutions
Jeanne Theoharis:
We're, we're doing a job where, and so to see the role, like I think people have done some reallyimportant work in terms of conceptualizing what a prison industrial complex is and how many peopleare invested then in and jobs in that. And so then you have to be producing like results. And so again, Ithink we need much more scrutiny of that. I guess the answer to your question is kind of picking upyour, you know, I think sometimes we tend to think about like the way forward is the low-hanging fruit,the most sympathetic right in it. And I think particularly around things like solitary confinement, right?And it, it makes sense in some ways, right? So, you know, waging the campaign against solitaryconfinement for people under 18 or, but that it base, if you believe that prolonged solitary confinementis torture, then it, you actually have to start with what we might call the high hanging fruit, right.
Jeanne Theoharis:
Because as long as you have the high hanging fruit solitary confinement exists, if you dismantle the ideathat for terrorists, for, uh, people who commit, you know, the, the incest incest, right? The people whoare, who we imagine as that, that is still torture to them and that we don't toruture, like we're not goingto defeat solitary confinement. I don't believe until we take on the hardest cases, because at some level,if we don't, then we're sort of tacitly saying, okay, some people don't deserve this, but this is necessary.It's useful. It's, you know, we have we still have to have it because of these super bad guys. And so insome sense, all the research, right, that shows how it's torture then gets kind of shunted aside. So Iguess in terms of building campaigns against, you know, some of these very inhumane practices, I thinkwe have to kind of reconceptualize kind of the importance of going after the harder, the harder cases.
Faisal Hashmi:
Yeah. Just, you know, the past 20 years, our community has been ravaged by surveillance, byinformants. I don't want to meet new friends, or I don't want to make new friends. You know, ourmosques have been spied upon Matt Apuzzo, and Adam Goldman wrote a book called Enemies Withinthe details that Trevor Aronson's work of the intercept, where thousands work, you know, highlights allthese types of things. And, you know, we bought the brunt end of it for the past 20 years. And that's nota future I want for my kids. We don't have safe spaces to grow, explore, think, have conversations. Andthat's tragic, right? And that's by design as well by the powers that be their policies, their structure, theirlaw enforcement initiatives, right. They were designed to it. Recently in the New York times, a guynamed Terry Albury, a former FBI agent basically speaks to this in detail, invite everybody to go readthat book and think I'm not booked that, that article in New York times from last week, I Destroy Lives.
Faisal Hashm:
You know, he talks about it in detail. He was stationed in Minneapolis in many of these ISIS cases. Andbasically he talks about, uh, law enforcement outreach being a facade, a hoax as employed to, youknow, undermine communities who wants that? After they're done with my community, they're gonnamove on to another community. They have moved on to other community who wants to normalize thistype of interaction? Shouldn't we be allowed. shouldn't my children be allowed to have a fairopportunity to grow up without the threat of being spied upon without the threat of, uh, havinginformants placed in their midst and putting them at risk. And we have to decide now who has the rightthoughts about these things who's working on these things and how to, which groups are working onthese things and how to get, go about addressing it to the larger public for all our wellbeing.

Pardiss Kebriaei:
ThankyouFaisal.Wecouldkeeptalking.Imean,IguessIwouldjustwanttoendreally,endnowwithany,intermsofpeoplewhoneed,whoareinnow,youMurtazaearlier,youweresayinglotsofcasesandnamesweknow,andthatwetalkedabouttoday,butothersthatarewayundertheradar,many,but are there any particular cases or people who need attention right now that you can think of or wantto share before we end?
Murtaza Hussain:
Uh, you know, it's interesting, every time I write about this subject, even I wrote a piece, a retrospectiveabout it for a, you know, the 20 year anniversary of 9-11. Inevitably, I get people reaching out to me,family members of people in prison, uh, cases, which are under scrutinized people from prison directlycontacting me and the core. So by phone and so forth. But there's just so so many I could pick many andthe, you know, the one I just will keep belaboring because I, uh, it's like my Moby Dick is the Fort Dix onebecause they're still in jail for life in prison. For that case. Then if you study that case and the facts of thecase, you will see it's an emblematic of all the wrong things that happen after 9-11 and the unaddressedwrongs too. They're still taking place there.
Murtaza Hussain:The father of the three brothers arrested actually died a few years ago or two years ago. And I knew himvery well. And his last, the only thing he wanted was to see his sons one last time. He used to say that if Icould just see my sons one more time outside of prison and I could just die happy. And that's all I want.And he never got to see that because just the cruelty and the inertia and the people want to covering,covering, you know, their flaws or their failures in the past stubbornness, uh, all these things, racism,obviously, of course too. So all these things conspired to put key people like them in jail and put them injail beyond the point that, uh, anybody would ever think this is rational or normal. And one thing I wouldsay, though, regarding looking back over cases, if you look at the cases the first decade after 9-11, youwill find people who are convicted according to this, uh, academic theory referred to as predisposition.
Murtaza Hussain:
So predisposition was the idea that, you know, there was all these radicalization frameworks posted onlevel two, created the NYP framework, and many, many others are very pseudo-academic and pseudoscientific, but they basically were used to establish certain people because of their beliefs as attributedto them by the prosecution and the experts were predisposed to violence. They could not be dissuadedfrom violence, regardless of whether they actually did the actual thing they're being accused of or not.So it was like a trump card bringing prosecutions and effectively, it meant that anyone who was Muslimessentially to get sent to jail on terrorism charges, regardless of the context, because all you do theexpert witnesses to say that this person's beliefs, you know, they're Muslim, Muslim, and then, youknow, they're inherently violent. So don't worry too much about the actual organizations look at that.So, you know, you cannot ask that this academic consensus on the subject is evolved and it's completelyrejects that now.
Murtaza Hussain:
And there was never any logic or substantiation behind it by any empirical measure at all the experts likeEvan Coleman and others who were very much involved in courts in that era. You know, they cannotreally use them anymore because it's just so obvious spurious, but you look at the predisposition
16The Activist Files Episode 42: Reﬂecting on 20 years of the 
war terror at home: federal prosecutionsconvictions, look at all those cases, people still in jail, oftentimes for decades or life. And you'll see that,uh, you'll see that many, many people are still in jail unjustly. And you know, it's a good way ofunpacking the legacy that era and reckoning with it, and also defending things that are happening in thefuture.
Pardiss Kebriaei:
Yeah. And I'm going to plug your, your recent article on the Intercept about the Fort Dix Five, which talksabout, um, Coleman and sort of debunked theories of radicalization and the cases you're talking about.So thank you all, so very much a huge amount of respect for each of you, all of the resources andarticles. And I don't know, things that the cases that we talked about, we will name, mention, or link toin the description that goes out with the podcast. And thank you all for being here and everyone forlistening.
