NYPDApril 5, 2018 In a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of stories, the Associated Press revealed through leaked documents that the New York Police Department (NYPD) had secretly launched a vast program of human mapping and surveillance carried out by a so-called "demographics" unit that targeted Muslim communities in New York, New Jersey, and beyond. For years, officers and informants had been spying on hundreds of mosques, student groups, and Muslim-owned businesses, solely on the basis of religion or ethnicity. Produced by Flatbush Pictures, HASSAN V. NYPD tells the dramatic story of how ten New Jersey plaintiffs--a group of imams, college students, business owners, school teachers, and a U.S. army sergeant--came together to stand up to the NYPD in a critical fight for equal protection under the Constitution and how they won. Hassan v.
