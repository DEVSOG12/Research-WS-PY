ruI. AMICUS CURIAE THE NATIONAL CENTER F'OR
MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
("NCMEC") was established in 1984 and serves as the Congressionally-
designated "official national resource center and information
clearinghouse for missing and exploited children." 42 U.S.C. $
5773(bX1)(B). NCMEC assists in reducing child sexual exploitation,
preventing child victimization, and eliminating child sex traffrcking and
child pornography.
In cooperation with the United States Department of Justice's
Off,rce of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, NCMEC performs
22 stalutorily-authorized functions. See 42 U.S.C. $ 5773(b). NCMEC
provides support, information, and technical assistance to families, law
enforcement, and child-serving professionals in identifying, locating, and
recovering victims of child sex trafficking.
For several years, NCMEC has engaged in numerous discussions
and meetings with Backpage regarding child sex traffrcking ads on its site
and explained how Backpage's business practices encourage an online
environment for child sex trafficking. These meetings have included
Backpage's owners and operational and legal executives. Subsequent to
these meetings, Backpage has made minimal, but largely ineffective,
adjustments to its practices, and it continues to facilitate the sale of
children for sex on its website. Backpage voluntarily reports only
selective information to NCMEC about ads suspected of child sex
trafficking. NCMEC refers these ads to the appropriate law enforcement
authorities. These reports account for what NCMEC believes to be only a
small fraction of the children traff,rcked online at backpage.com.
1NCMEC has unique knowledge and experience regarding how
traffrckers use online classified advertising to facilitate child sex
trafficking. NCMEC operates the CyberTipline, the national reporting
mechanism for suspected child sexual exploitation, and the Child Sex
Traffrcking Team (CSTT), a dedicated staff providing technical and victim
assistance and analysis on domestic child sex traffrcking cases. Because
of NCMEC's work and its experience with Backpage, NCMEC is
specially situated to aid the Court's consideration of this appeal' The
Court should accept and consider this brief.
NCMEC has no financial interest in the outcome of this case. No
counsel for a party authored any part of this brief or funded its preparation
or submission. This brief is solely the work of NCMEC and its counsel.
il. BACKPAGE ENABLES CREATION AND ENCOURAGES
DISSEMINÄTION OF CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING
CONTENT ON ITS WEBSITE
"On a tCRl 12(b)(6) motion, a challenge to the legal sufficiency of
the plaintiff s allegations must be denied unless no state of facts which
plaintiff could prove, consistent with the complaint, would entitle the
plaintiff to relief on the claim." McCurry v. Chevy Chase Bank, FSB,169
V/n. 2d 96, 101 (2010) (internal quotation omitted). When reviewing a
motion to dismiss, the "court may consider hypothetical facts not part of
the formal record." Hoffer v. State, 1 10 Wn. 2d 4I5,420 (1988). In
deciding this appeal, this Court should take into account the additional
facts set forth in this brief.
As documented in detail in the numerous publications referenced
in the briefs of other amici, child sex traffrcking is a pervasive and
destructive crime. Thousands of children every day all over this country
suffer traumatic criminal abuse similar to that alleged by the three
2Plaintiffs in this case.
Last year, one in seven runaways reported missing to NCMEC was
likety a child sex traff,rcking victim. ln20l3 alone, NCMEC documented
over 10,000 reports of child sex trafftcking. This is only a tiny percentage
of the abuse, misery, and exploitation suffered by children who are
victimized through child sex traffrcking.l In the past five years, NCMEC
has seen a I,432Yo increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking.
This enormous increase is directly correlated to the increased use of the
Internet to sell children for sex.
Technology has fundamentally changed how children are
victimized through sex trafficking. Today, an adult can shop online from
the privacy of his home or hotel room to purchase a sexual experience.
Pimps and predatory offenders are aware that escort ads on backpage.com
provide a marketplace of young girls and boys to purchase for rape and
other sexual activities. Backpage knows that it actively encourages a
lucrative marketplace for child sex trafftcking, and yet has rejected most
proposals to meaningfully reduce the selling and buying of children for
unlawful sex through its website. A majority of the child sex trfficking
cases being reported to NCMEC now involve ads posted on
baclcpage.com.
A. Backpage's Ads Facilitate Sex With Children
As the Court is aware from the recotd, ads in the "escorts" section
on backpage.com typically consist of a headline, a photograph, and a brief
I Electronic service providers are obligated to report to NCMEC instances of apparent
child pornography. See l8 U.S.C. $ 22584(a). No federal or state law imposes a
comparable requirement to report child sex trafficking.
aJtext regarding the services being sold. Escort ads require customers to
enter their age, but Backpage conducts no age verification to determine the
veracity of the submitted age. Backpage will not process an escort ad
when an age under 18 years old is entered. Instead, the customer receives
a message stating "Oops! Sorry, the ad poster must be over 18 years of
age." Even though Backpage has been alerted to the fact that the customer
is trying to create an escort ad involving a child, it enables the customer to
change the age to 18 or above and then still allows the submission of the
same text and the same photograph of the child. In practice, Backpage's
age filter guides pimps on how to successfully create a child sex
trafficking ad.
Ads reported to NCMEC by concerned members of the public, and
by Backpage itself, often feature highly suggestive and graphic
photographs of what appear to be children. Often, it is plain from the ad's
photograph that the person being offered for paid sex is a child who looks
younger, and sometimes much younger, than 18 years old. Invariably, the
ad's photograph is accompanied by text that unambiguously and luridly
describes the sexual experience being sold. Law enforcement has
confirmed to NCMEC that each of the following Backpage ads advertised
a child fbr sex:
¡ "Hi, GUYS I'm NEW TO [ ], NOT TO THE LIFE,
YOUNG HOT (u need that) THAT YOUNG GIRL LOOIIBODY
SKILLS OF A WELL TRAINED V/OMAN FETISH ALERT-LIL-GIRL-
ROLE PLAY//DRESS UP, MORE DOM., THEN SUBMISSIVE."
o "Enjoy both me and my girlfriend for an hour of the most
pleasure you can experience as one mar."
o "I enjoy catering to mature gentlemen. My body is a
gentleman' s playground."
4. ..LETS PARTY!* I LOVE TO MAKE . . . -THOSE TOES
cuRL- - - - -!!* INDULGE * THESE.SOFT- .- .- THICK
THIGHS, PULL THIS LONG RED HAIR & SLAP THIS FATT
JIGGLEY AZZI"
o "You pay to get it just how you like it, and juicy and
waiting on you - - - I promise your going to enjoy me . . ."
Regrettably, these ads are just a few of many Backpage child sex
trafficking ads reported to NCMEC. Some of these ads are reported by
Backpage moderators and some are received from members of the public.
Of these public reports, 64%o were reporting suspected child sex
trafficking on backpage.com.
Behind the tens of thousands of Backpage ads investigated by law
enforcement there are victims with stories much like "Alissa," who over a
two year period "was sold to johns seven days a week, 365 days ayeat,"
was transfened like chattel from pimp to pimp for roughly $10,000 per
transaction, and had her jaw and ribs broken when she tried to escape. See
Nicholas D. Kristof, Wltere Pimps Peddle Their Goods, New York Times
(Mar. 17,2012).
Recent cases handled by NCMEC tell similarly grim stories of
children sold repeatedly for sex on Backpage. In one case, a child was
reported missing thirteen times before she was 15 years old. The
trafficker forced the child to get alarge "Daddy's Princess" tattoo on her
stomach. A member of the public reported a Backpage ad to NCMEC that
was visually matched to the missing child. She was recovered by local
law enforcement, but went missing again. A year later, a Backpage
moderator reported another ad for the same child because she "appeared
young." NCMEC ran a basic Google search of the telephone number in
5the reported ad and identifred more than fifty active Backpage ads using
the same telephone contact number and depicting the same child.
Backpage did not report any of these other active ads to NCMEC, even
though the one ad it did report contained the same telephone number and
showed the same child being sold for sex. When law enforcement again
recovered the child, she disclosed being sold and raped at least five times
every night for three years.
In another case reported to NCMEC, a 16 yeat old went missing
from a Georgia home in December 2012. In May }}I3,NCMEC matched
online images of the child from her Facebook account to sexually graphic
photos believed to be the child on an active Backpage ad. The ad
remained live on Backpage; Backpage never reported the ad to NCMEC.
Backpage enables the public to "report" an ad and include an
explanatory comment. Backpage voluntarily reports to NCMEC some ads
reported by the public. Backpage also reports certain ads flagged by its
moderators for possible child sex traffrcking. NCMEC has no specific
information about the work of these moderators, but a significant slice of
the ads Backpage reports to NCMEC have already been reported to
Backpage by family members of the children featured in the ads'
Even after reporting ads to NCMEC fbr suspected child sex
traffrcking, Backpage refuses to implement obvious measures to remove
these ads from public view or block trafftckers from placing new ads for
the same child over and over again with the same email address, the same
telephone number, the same credit card information, or the same or very
similar photos. Discovery of Backpage's files likely would reveal a
volume of similarly disturbing evidence demonstrating Backpage's
complicity in enabling and encouraging child sex traffrcking in
6Washington and throughout the United States.
These are some of the many comments submitted by family
members when reporting escort ads to Backpage for child sex trafficking:2
. "No the girl in the is 16 shes my cousin she ra[n] away from
home two monthsãgo . . . The cops r trying to get her and her pimp She is
a runaway She got tattoos of her pimp on her lower stomach and upper
right eyebrow."
. "The following posting is of my son, age 15 dressed in drag.
You will delete this posting today before I contact the [ ] Attorney
General's Office."
. "This ad has photos of my 16 year old sister who currently being
trafficked and we are tiying to get home. 'We have an active investigation
going on and am trying to get her away from her pimp and bring her
ñomõ. Please stop állowing whoever it is to post her. She only a minor and
we want her home."
. "How dare you allow a post of my juvenile daughter being used
in a sex trafficking post! Shame on you backpage- you know what you're
really all about and I am on a mission to take you down' . . . Shame shame
shame!"
NCMEC's experience is that Backpage does not consistently
remove ads it reports to NCMEC for possible child sex traffrcking.
Instead, even though the children offered in the ads have been reported to
NCMEC as likely sex traffrcking victims, Backpage continues to host
many of these ads, enabling and encouraging adults to oontinue to
purchase these apparent children for rape and other sexual exploitation.
B. Backpage Knows Its Claimed Efforts To Reduce Child
Sex TraffÏcking On Its Website Are Ineffective
Carl Ferrer, a Backpage executive, has stated in court testimony
that the site's "Report Ad" button is an effective means to "remove ads
2These posts have been edited to remove personally identi$'ing information.
7when they are brought to our attention by other users as being possibly
illegal." This statement is contradicted by what happens when someone
reports an ad for removal. When a user clicks the "Report Ad" button,
Backpage delivers the following message: "If you accidentally reported
this ad, do not worry. It takes multiple reports from multiple people for an
ad to be removed." Comments submitted by family members who report
ads of their children being sold for sex make clear that they are painfully
aware their reports do not result in Backpage removing ads of their
children; instead the cycle of sexual exploitation and abuse for these
children and their families continues:
. "My name is [ ] and my wife is [ ]. Your website has ads
featuring our 16 year old daughter [ ], posing as an escort. - She is being
pimped out by her old bt and she is underage. - I have emailed the ad
multiple times using your website, but have gotten no response. . . . - For
God's sake, she's only 16. Her bf is having her use a prepaid card. You
need better means of age verification. Stuff like this shouldn't be allowed
to happen."
o "Please remove this. This is my 16 year old daughters
picture. I e-mailed already. Whoever's posting this please block there card
or email from posting."
o "THIS CHILD IS 16 AND MY DAUGHTER I am
demanding that you remove this ad and deactivate her account. Her name
is not Ashley and she is not 18. I am contacting the local authorities. This
kind of trash is really unnecessary whether it be my daughter or someone
else's. I get carded for cigarettes and am 44 years old, and you allow teens
to post any age on something far more dangerous. . . ."
V/hile Backpage refuses to consistently remove ads reported for
suspected child sex trafficking, it regularly removes "sting ads" placed by
law enforcement to investigate traffrckers and recover trafficked minors.
Backpage has indicated that "sting ads" violate its terms of use, but does
8not apply these terms of use consistently to also remove ads reported by
parents whose children are being bought and sold for sex on its site.
Backpage has repeatedly claimed in public statements and court
filings that it is working to reduce child sex traffrcking on its website. The
unpleasant reality is that Backpage publicizes carefully selected
operational processes as a subterfuge to avoid increased scrutiny, while
providing traffickers with easy access to an online venue to sell children
for sex. In practice, Backpage's stated interest in doing something
meaningful to stop child sex trafficking ads on its site is apparently
overridden by the enoffnous revenue it generates from its escort ads,
including ads selling children for sex.
It is NCMEC's experience that Backpage fails to search its own
system for, or report ads linked by, a name, photograph, email address,
telephone number, or credit card to a previously reported child trafficking
ad. As a sophisticated electronic information provider, Backpage surely
has the technical ability to generate these links and use them to block
andlor report new ads to protect child victims from further abuse by the
same trafficker. Backpage has testified it can easily search its ads,3 but
has told NCMEC that it cannot undertake this process to protect children
from being repeatedly tratÏcked on its website. Even if Backpage
removes an ad reported to NCMEC, it permits the traffrcker to use the
same credit or debit card to create new or additional ads with the same
3 Backpage's National Accounts Manager for "nonadult moderation" has testified that
Backpage can use Google or another search engine to locate ads ifthey "have snippets of
ads, specific pieces oftexts, telephone numbers, [or] any type ofother pertinent specific
information that's been listed in an advertisemenl." See U.S. v. Custis, No. I l-60065-
LENARD (Nov. 16, 20ll),pp.16l-62.
9email address, telephone number, and even the same photograph of the
same child.
Backpage optimizes the ability of traffickers to post escort ads by
imposing less stringent posting rules for sex trafficking ads than it does for
other ad categories. A user wanting to post an ad on Backpage to sell a
boat, motorcycle, or pet must provide a valid telephone number to
,'prevent scam ads from being posted." Yet Backpage refuses to require
verified email addresses or telephone numbers for escort ads. Backpage
does more to protect customers from scam pet ads than to protect children
from being sold for sex, and maintains this position even though it knows
its site is used to sell children for sex.
Backpage encoufages and facilitates child sex trafftcking ads in
many other ways. For example, it accepts anonymous forms of payment,
such as prepaid credit cards and, most recently, bitcoin, which often are
difficult, if not impossible, to track. Backpage repeatedly refuses to
require that ads be purchased with a bank-reco gnized credit or debit card.
In an April 74,2010 blog to users, Backpage even provided guidance on
how to remain anonymous when posting an ad: "If you want to remain
completely anonymous, get an AMEX or VISA gift card, which are sold at
most grocery stores and online. They work just like credit and debit cards,
only they are prepaid, and no personal data is attached to them."
Backpage's pricing model maximizes revenue for escort ads.
While itisfree to post an ad on Backpage to sell any item or service in a
non-adultldating category, there is always a fee to post an escort ad.
Backpage's carl Ferrer has testified they "charge for adult ads to help
insure that the content is legal." A Backpage blogpost on November 6,
2008 said charging a fee "is perhaps the best way to reduce the prank
10postings, illegal postings, and postings by under aged users." Backpage
executives have told NCMEC that they charge for escort ads only because
law enforcement asked them to do so. Yet Backpage rigorously calibrates
its escort ad prices depending on the market, demonstrating that its pricing
motivation is to maximize revenues, not to comply with an alleged law
enforcement request.
As of September 2,2014, Washington escort ad prices on
backpage.com ranged from a high in Seattle of $12 to post, $32 to
sponsor, and $48 to auto repost, to a low in PullmarVMoscow of $3 to
post, $4 to sponsor and $12 to auto repost. Not surprisingly, Backpage
generates tremendous revenues from trafficking ads. S¿e Mark V/hittaker,
Baclrpage Raises Rates Again, Escort-Ad Revenue Jumps 55 Percent
(April 1,2013). Discovery in this matter likely will indicate to what
extent Backpage's reluctance to institute or enforce protective measures to
ensure children are not trafhcked for sex on its site is driven by an interest
in maintaining high revenues.
Through its various business practices and because of its financial
self-interest, Backpage encourages and is actively complicit in promoting
child sex traff,rcking through its ads. The Plaintiffs in this case should be
allowed to conduct discovery of Backpage's records to determine the
scope of that complicity and, if proven, obtain appropriate compensation
for their consequential injuries.
C. Backpage Refuses To Modify Its Business Practices To
Minimize Child Sex Trafficking
The number of Backpage ads reported to NCMEC is only a small
fraction of the true number of Backpage's child victims. In20l2
Backpage's Carl Ferrer told the National Association of Attorneys General
11that Backpage identifies more than 400 "adult entertainment" posts each
month thatmay involve a child. More recently, Backpage's General
Counsel Liz McDougall was reported as stating the website "removes or
blocks about a million ads per month, notably those that appear to involve
minors or sex for money." Despite Backpage's admissions regarding the
heavy volume of ads selling children for sex on its site, Backpage does not
report most of these ads to NCMEC, takes insuffrcient (if any) steps to
block these ads from being re-posted, and accepts repeat payments for
these and identical ads.
NCMEC has long pressed Backpage to take meaningful and
permanent steps to ensufe it does not facilitate ads offering paid sex with
children. In an effort to provide guidance on how to reduce the likelihood
of children being trafficked for sex online, NCMEC has compiled a set of
recommended sound practices that can be implemented to reduce the
possibility that a classified ad website will be used for child sexual
traffrcking. NCMEC has repeatedly made these recommendations
available to Backpage. NCMEC's recommended sound practices include:
. Prohibit payment sources that mask the customer's identify, such
as prepaid or gift cards;
. Verify identity and age of the customer and person in the ad;
. Require and validate the customer's email address and telephone
number;
. Capture and store the customer's IP address when ad is created;
. Block and remove ads believed to involve children sold for sex;
. Require revised ads to undergo moderator review; recapturing
the customerts IP address and revalidating their email address and
telephone number;
t2. Digitally "hash" photographs from blocked or removed ads and
compare with photographs in other ads submitted for posting;
. Flag ads rePorted for
child sex traffr ePhone number,
email address, , and use this
information to screen incoming ads;
. Reject ads with previously reported images, phone numbers,
credit card numbers, or email addresses;
. Refuse to post ads from customers previously reported for
posting potential child sex traffrcking ads; and
. Monitor and enforce Terms prohibiting trafficking of minors.
Backpage has refused to adopt most of these recommended
practices. To all intents and purposes, Backpage has instituted no
effective procedures to prevent child sex trafficking ads from being
created on its site. Instead Backpage has implemented a system of
voluntarily reporting certain ads to NCMEC based on its own self-
selected, limited, and (based on the results) wholly inadequate criteria.
Even when Backpage does report an ad to NCMEC, it is after collecting
and keeping the ad fee, and often without removing the reported ad from
public view. And, as noted earlier, Backpage routinely permits new ads
featuring photos of the same victim or the same contact information to be
created and remain active over the following clays and rnonths.
Of course, virtually any website is vulnerable to abuse by users.
However, to the outside observer, Backpage's business practices seem
designed to provide an environment enabling pimps to traffic children for
paid sex through online ads at backpage.com.
Under well-established principles of Washington pleading law,
Plaintiffs here have pleaded sufficient facts, as supplemented by the facts
set forth in this and other amicus briefs, to defeat a motion to dismiss their
13complaint. Discovery will show the extent to which Backpage's professed
efforts to screen out child sex trafficking ads are genuine (for example, by
reviewing the records of Backpage's ad screeners and its protocols for
creating an ad, screening for and rejecting ads offering children, and
flagging and banning repeat offenders). Similarly, discovery will
determine the extent to which Backpage's processes are, as it claims, well-
intentioned rules designed to prevent illegal conduct on its site.
NCMEC has had extensive interaction with Backpage and its
website operations. Backpage manages its escort ads as a lucrative profit
center and facilitates the use of its website for the sexual victimization of
children, while simultaneously maintaining a veneer of concern for its
victims. Discovery from Backpage likely would confirm that conclusion,
creating liability that is not immunizedby Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act.
ilI. THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT DOES NOT
REQUIRE DISMISSAL OF'THIS CASE
Backpage hides behind Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act ("CDA"). Backpage's defense belittles and denigrates this
statute. Congress never intended the CDA to empower, in the name of
Internet freedom, a website whose pulpose, structure, and effect is to
enable traffrckers to advertise the sale of unlawful sex with children'
Section 230(cXl) of the CDA provides that "[n]o provider or user
of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or
speaker of any information provided by another information content
provider." 47 U.S.C. $ 230(cX1). Section 230 is intended to promote the
dissemination of information through the Internet, not to facilitate the
sexual exploitation of children for corporate financial gain.
t4Congress never intended Section 230 to immunize the deliberate
promotion of child sex trafftcking. To the contrary, Section 230 was part
ofa larger Congressional effort to protect children from pernicious
content online. No appellate court has ever squarely held that Section
230's immunity extends to the unrestricted publication of child sex
traffrcking ads. This Court should not be the first to cross that line.
Moreover, even if Congressional intent is ignored, the text of
Section 230(c) exempts website operators from liability for content posted
by their users only when the website operator acts neutrally with respect to
what is objectionable about the content. Once a website operator "in some
way specifically encourages development of what is offensive about the
content," FTC v. Accusearch, Inc., 570 F.3d 1187, 1199 (10th Cir. 2009),
the website operator becomes an "information content provider" who may
be held responsible for the site's contents under 47 U.S.C. $ 230(f)(3)' On
the facts as pleaded and as stated in this brief, Backpage fits within the
Ac cus e arch parameters.
The CDA was intended "to provide much-needed protection for
children" by prohibiting the distribution of obscene and indecent material
to children over the Internet. 141 Cong. Rec. 58088 (June 9, 1995) (Sen.
Exon). What is now Section 230 was an amendment tacked onto a bill
intended to protect children from exploitative content on the Internet,
including child sex trafficking and pornography. 'Whatever Congress
intended in Section 230,itmost certainly did not intend to immunize child
sex trafficking ads or websites that published those ads.
Introducing what became the CDA, Senator Exon stated:
The information superhighway should not become a red
light district. . . .Once passed, our children and families will
be better protected from those who would electronically
15cruise the digital world to engage children in inappropriate
communications and introductions.
Robert Cannon, The Legislative History of Senator Exon's
Communications Decency Act,49 Fed. Comm'ns Law J. 51, 54 (1996).
"The fundamental purpose of the Communications Decency Act is to
provide much needed protection for children." Id. at 57 . Backpage's
escort sex ads are a virtual "red light district" engaging "children in
inappropriate . . . introductions." Id. Any legal immunity for such
conduct flies in the face of Congress' intent when it passed the CDA.
The CDA emerged from the House-Senate Conference Committee
containing both a prohibition on disseminating "indecent and obscene"
materials to children and the publisher immunity in what is now Section
230(c). Id. a|64. Congress passed that bill and President Clinton signed
it. Id. at92. Subsequently, the Supreme Court invalidated, on First
Amendment grounds, thatpartof the CDA prohibiting dissemination of
"indecent" materials online to children, leaving intact only the prohibition
against disseminating obscene materials to children and Section 230. See
Reno v. ACLU,521 U.S. 844, 885 (1997). But contrary to Backpage's
suggestion, this paring of the statute provides no legal cover for a website
that encourages and facilitates advertising for paid sex with children.
V/hen the Supreme Court found part of the CDA constitutionally
overbroad, it did not question - much less reject - the essential
Congressional intent underlying the whole statute, including Section 230,
to protect children from online "red light"-type activities, The Plaintiffs
here are entitled to this protection from Backpage and its customers.
No constitutional principle or legitimate policy goal is served by
immunizing from liability a website's encouragement of sexual
exploitation of children for financial gain. See Osborne v. Ohio,495 U.S.
t6103, 110 (1990) (upholding statute banning possession of child
pornography because "[i]t rarely has been suggested that the constitutional
freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing
used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal
statute"); Ginsberg v. New York,390 U.S. 629, 639-40 (1968) (state can
enact laws to protect children against obscenity that would not be
constitutional if applied to adults).
Protecting children from those who encourage and enable their
sexual victimization is the most compelling of governmental interests. See
Osborne,495 U.S. at 109 ("It is evident beyond the need for elaboration
that a State's interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-
being of a minor is compelling."). In enacting the CDA, Congress chose
to protect neutral conduits of information and Good Samaritans from
liabitity. The Supreme Court did not take away from this (or any other)
State the power to hold accountable those who structure and encourage
use of their websites to sexually exploit children. See Accusearch,5T0
F.3d at 1199. Plaintiffs J.S., S.L., and L.C. should be allowed an
opportunity to hold Backpage accountable for their injuries.a
No appellate court has ever held that the CDA immunizes business
practices that knowingly encourage, promote, and profit from advertising
for child sex traffrcking. Indeed, while Backpage's brief talks about
a See Ryan Dyer, The Communications Decency Act Gone lltlild: A Case For Renewing
The Presumption Against Preemption,3T Seattle Univ. L.R. 837,854 (2014) ("As more
and more criminal activity migrates to the Internet and with the apparent difficulty of
states to criminalize complicity by intermediaries, section 230's preemptive effect on
traditional state laws is mounting. These civil and criminal laws stand at the heart of
states' historic police powers. Surely, this was not Congress's intent when it enacted
section 230.").
t7"hundreds" of cases finding Section 230 immunity, in practice, immunity
has been denied in more than forty percent of adjudicated CDA cases. See
David S. Ardia, Free Speech or Shieldfor Scoundrels: An Empirical Study
of Intermediate Immunity Under Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act,43 Loy. L.A. L.R. 373, 435 (2010).
As the Tenth Circuit explained, "one is not 'responsible' for the
development of offensive content if one's conduct was neutral with
respect to the offensiveness of the content," but an Internet service
provider is responsible for content "if it in some way specifically
encourages development of what is offensive about the content."
Accusearch, 570 F.3d atIl99.
Backpage promotes a highly visible advertising platform broken
down by states and communities to facilitate pimps to reach buyers in
whatever market a child is being sold on any particular day. Backpage has
not implemented most of the sound practices NCMEC recommends to
reduce child sex traffrcking ads on its site. Backpage guides traffickers
through the process of developing ads, and prompts users to enter an adult
age, rather than a child's age, to create an escort ad. Backpage allows
traffrckers to pay to advertise children for sex using anonymous payment
methods, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement to track the
source of payments. For traffickers not sawy enough to think of using
anonymous gift cards on their own, Backpage has advised them exactly
how to get and use them. Backpage removes sting ads placed by law
enforcement for investigating child sex trafficking. Backpage accepts and
retains payment not only for ads it believes relate to child sex trafftcking,
but also for ads repeatedly reported by parents and loved ones ofchild
victims. And Backpage does not remove from public view all active ads
t8that it reports to NCMEC for suspected child sex traffrcking.
Even when suspected child sex trafficking ads are removed,
Backpage's procedures ensure such removals are more of an irritant to
pimps rather than an impediment or deterrent. Backpage does not screen
or remove other active ads with the same photographs or contact
information as in the ads it reports to NCMEC for suspected child sex
trafficking. Nor does Backpage identify or bar repeat violators of its terms
of use. If an ad is taken down, the pimp can, with Backpage's
acquiescence, re-post the ad selling the same child for sex using the same
photograph, telephone number, or credit card information. Because of
Backpage's deliberate design and absence of protective protocols, children
are advertised for sex on its site every day and, as a direct result, are raped
repeatedly by adults who pay Backpage's customer, the child's pimp, for
their perverse pleasure. The law - surely - does not allow that.
The clear Congressional intent is that the CDA should protect
children from predators looking for paid sex with children, not promote
the sexual victimization of children. To hold otherwise would place a
judicial imprimatur on the activities of pimps and their customers.
Congress intended the statute to have the reverse effect. This Court
should conclude that, in the procedural context of this case, Plaintiffs have
pleaded sufficient facts at least to avoid dismissal now, and that they have
the right to proceed to discovery with Backpage.
A ruling against Backpage will not threaten website operators who
passively deliver user content or operators who act as Good Samaritans in
screening unlawful material. Such operators will still be able to free
themselves of lawsuits "at the earliest possible stage of the case" and
avoid "having to fight costly and protracted legal battles." Fair Housing
t9Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommatescom, LLC, 521 F.3d II57 ,
Il75 (gth Cir. 2008) (en banc). Only where, as is the case with Backpage,
a plaintiff can allege the website operator "in some way specifically
encourages development of what is offensive about the content," will a
website operator face litigation, discovery, and potential damages.
Accusearch, Inc., 570 F.3d at 1199.
Backpage runs, at considerable profit, a business optimized to
promote child sex traffrcking, and has specifically instructed its users on
how to make the most out of the tools Backpage provides.
Encouragement and facilitation of child rape is beyond the immunity
afforded by Section 230. Accordingly, NCMEC urges this Court to allow
Plaintiffs' case to proceed so Plaintifß may have their deserved day in
court against Backpage.
IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and also for the reasons set forth in
Respondents' brief and the briefs of other amici, NCMEC requests this
Court affirm the decision of the Superior Court denying Backpage's
motion to dismiss.
