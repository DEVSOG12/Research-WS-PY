Use [your] resources, whether that is a therapist, a victim advocate or whomever [you've] connected with, ...to help [you] through the process because it’s very challenging and difficult.”- Heather Bryan, Therapist and FAON MemberLocating AttorneysA child whose sexually exploitative photos or videos are shared online has a legal right to seek monetary restitution from all offenders who create, share, or possess these images/videos. Because the process to seek monetary restitution is complex and often confusing, it may be helpful for you to have an attorney when you navigate the legal system. NCMEC can talk you through these legal issues and help you find an attorney who will work on your behalf. For more information, contact gethelp@ncmec.org or 1-877-446-2632 ext. 6117.“We think you’re worth something, the law thinks you are worth something, the American public thinks you’re worth something. That’s why these laws are in place, that’s why the system has been set-up and you need to take advantage of it.”- Erik Bauer, Attorney who has represented survivorsSign Up! ►Get the latest updates from NCMECENSPBlogMediaContactLegal T&CDonor PrivacyOur ImpactCareersAbout UsLeadershipFloridaNew YorkTexasCopyright © National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
