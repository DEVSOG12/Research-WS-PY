Overview
1  NCMEC uses the word “victim” to consistent with law, protocol and policy, and to recognize that a crime has been committed. This type of abuse and trauma should not define the 
people who have experienced itWhat is Child Sex Trafficking?
Child sex trafficking is a form of child abuse that occurs when a child under 18 is advertised, 
solicited or exploited through a commercial sex act. A commercial sex act is the exchange 
of anything of value – such as money, drugs or a place to stay for sexual activity.
Traffickers can be anyone who profits from the selling of a child for sex to a buyer, including: 
family members, foster parents, gangs, and perceived trusted adults or romantic partners. 
In some cases, there is no identified trafficker, and it is the person buying sex from the child 
who is exploiting the child’s vulnerabilities. For instance, if a child runs away, a buyer may 
exploit the child’s need for food and shelter by offering to provide that in exchange for sex.
Not every report NCMEC receives involves a missing child. Some reports include children being exploited while still living 
at home and going to school, sometimes by their own family. Other children who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking 
include homeless youth who have been kicked out due to lack of acceptance of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
In many situations, due to the trauma and manipulation from the trafficker, survivors will feel as if they are responsible for 
their own victimization. In some cases, even defending their abuser. It’s important to remember to meet survivors where 
they are at in understanding their victimization while also ensuring their rights and access to services as a victim1 of a 
crime are honored.
What We Are Seeing
In 2021 NCMEC received more than 17,200 reports  of 
child sex trafficking from all 50 U.S. States, Washington, 
D.C. and Puerto Rico which included every type of 
community: cities, small towns and tribal land.In 2021, of the 25,000 children reported  
missing to NCMEC who had run away,  
1 in 6 were likely sex trafficking victims.
19%  of the children who ran from the care of social 
services and were reported missing to NCMEC in 
2020, were likely victims of child sex trafficking.Child sex trafficking cases reported to NCMEC 
include male, female and transgender children.

Child sex trafficking victims often are unable to self-identify as 
victims or disclose their abuse because of fear, shame or loyalty to 
their abuser(s). It is not a child’s responsibility to ask for help. It is 
up to the professionals and trusted adults in these children’s lives 
to recognize the signs associated with child sex trafficking, so they 
can intervene and help them get the support they deserve.
These red flags or indicators should not be considered a checklist or 
an assessment tool. Rather, if observed they may be an opportunity 
to ask more questions, make a report to NCMEC’s CyberTipline or 
connect the child to resources for prevention or intervention.
