A nonfamily abduction occurs when a child is taken by someone known, but not related, to the child, such as a neighbor or an online acquaintance, or by someone unknown to the child. Nonfamily abductions are the rarest type of case and make up only 1% of the missing children cases reported to NCMEC.Risk FactorsNCMEC collects information concerning attempted abductions of children by individuals unknown to the child.  Based on over ten years of data, NCMEC identified that:Attempted abductions occur more often when a child is going to or from school or school-related activitiesSchool-age children are at greatest risk on school days before and after school (7-9 a.m. and 3-4 p.m.) and after dinner time (6-7 p.m.)Attempted abductions most often occur on the street while children are playing, walking, or riding bikesYounger children are more likely to be playing or walking with a parent or an adult whereas school-age children are more likely to be walking alone or with peers.Attempted abductions of older children are more likely to involve a sexual component.Children evaded abduction in a variety of ways, including:Ignoring or refusing the abductorUsing a cellphone to threaten or interveneFighting backScreaming and/or making noiseAnother adult or child intervenedAbductor left the area or voluntarily released the childAnalysis of Nonfamily Abductions Reported to NCMEC 2016-2020Published on Oct, 2022DownloadA 10-Year Analysis of Attempted Abductions and Related IncidentsDownloadBy the Numbers600 +attempted abductions were documented by NCMEC in 2020.In an analysis of attempted abductions, the most common lures used in attempts were:Offering the child a rideOffering the child candy or sweetsAsking the child questionsOffering the child moneyUsing an animal to interest the childWhat NCMEC is Doing About itPreventing Abduction Through EducationNCMEC, in partnership with Honeywell, created the KidSmartz Personal Safety Program, a program that educates families about preventing abduction and empowers children in grades K-5 to practice safer behaviors.
