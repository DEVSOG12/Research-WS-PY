to the National Center for Missing & 
Exploited Children® (NCMEC) in 2014 was 
likely a victim of sex trafficking.1 Traffickers 
constantly seek out opportunities to 
engage with and exploit vulnerable youth, 
and runaways are particularly vulnerable. 
Juvenile and family court judges have an 
enormous responsibility for the children 
and youth under their court’s jurisdiction. 
This includes ensuring safety, well-being, 
permanency, and rehabilitation for victims 
of child abuse and neglect and for youth 
involved in juvenile justice proceedings. 
When these already vulnerable children 
run away or go missing from a placement, 
the stakes are very high. Every moment 
counts and judges can take action to 
prevent exploitation by acting swiftly and 
collaboratively.
Growing understanding of the links between 
child welfare or juvenile justice involvement, 
domestic child sex trafficking, and children 
who run away or go missing from court-
ordered placements has led to the question: 
“What steps can a judge take when a 
child runs away or goes missing from 
care?”  This technical assistance brief is 
intended to educate judges about steps 
to be taken to assist in the location and 
recovery efforts for children missing from 
care by ensuring the legal guardians, social 
workers, and child advocates within child 
serving agencies are aware of and engage 
assistance from the National Center for 
Missing & Exploited Children on behalf of 
these endangered missing children.
The National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children® was established in 1984 as a

private, nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. 
From 1984 through 2014 NCMEC has 
assisted law enforcement in the recovery of 
more than 200,000 children. NCMEC stands 
ready to work with each jurisdiction and 
local community to discuss ways to serve as 
a valuable resource in your effort to protect 
children. Today NCMEC is authorized by 
the U.S. Congress to perform 22 specific 
programs and services including but not 
limited to (42 U.S.C. § 5773) :
1) Operate the official national resource 
center and information clearinghouse for 
missing and exploited children.
2) Operate a national 24-hour toll-free 
telephone line by which individuals 
may report information regarding the 
location of any missing child.
3) Provide technical assistance and training 
to law enforcement agencies, State 
and local governments, elements of 
the criminal justice system, public 
and private nonprofit agencies, 
and individuals in the prevention, 
investigation, prosecution, and 
treatment of cases involving missing and 
exploited children.
4) Provide assistance to families and 
law enforcement agencies in locating 
and recovering missing and exploited 
children, both nationally and, in 
cooperation with the Department of 
State, internationally.
5) Provide analytical support and technical 
assistance to law enforcement agencies 
through searching public records 
databases in locating and recovering 
missing and exploited children and 
helping to locate and identify abductors.

In 2012 NCJFCJ received funding from the 
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention (OJJDP) of the U.S. Department 
of Justice (DOJ) to develop training and 
judicial practice tools to better identify 
and serve victims of domestic child sex 
trafficking (DCST). Under this grant the 
NCJFCJ began work to raise awareness 
of the issue of DCST among juvenile and 
family court judges and build collaborative 
relationships with organizations such as the 
Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, 
and National Center for Missing & 
Exploited Children.
As part of this work NCJFCJ hosted a 
community roundtable meeting of judges 
and subject matter experts to discuss the 
role the courts can play in addressing the 
needs of victims of DCST. Time was spent 
discussing the vulnerability of youth in care 
and the common scenario of youth running 
away from placements and subsequently 
becoming victims of domestic child sex 
trafficking. This technical assistance brief 
is a product of that community roundtable 
meeting. It addresses one of the critical issues raised at that meeting, which 
is evaluating and proposing effective 
prevention and victim support service 
strategies for underage victims and survivors 
of DCST.

Between 100,000 and 300,000 youth are 
“at risk” for commercial sexual exploitation 
annually in the United States.2 In addition, 
approximately 1.6 million children run away 
every year in the United States.3 Children 
who run away are at high risk of child sexual 
exploitation due to their mental, physical, 
and financial vulnerability.4 Youth who 
have had contact with the child welfare 
system are at a higher risk for commercial 
sexual exploitation than children who have 
not had involvement in the child welfare 
system.5 Studies have also found 70 percent 
to 90 percent of commercially sexually 
exploited youth have a prior history of 
child sexual abuse.6 Traffickers are known 
to target youth shelters, group homes, 
and foster care facilities as locations for

“any individual less than 18 years of age 
whose whereabouts are unknown to such 
individual’s legal custodian.”8

3Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDRENprevention and response to children in care 
who are at-risk for sex trafficking, Section 
104 specifically adds two new requirements 
for state child welfare agencies to report 
missing youth to law enforcement within 
24 hours for entry into the National Crime 
Information Center and also separately to 
the National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children. These two reporting requirements 
are effective within two years of enactment 
of the law.”
The National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children has always been able to receive 
reports from legal guardians responsible for 
children missing from state care. However, 
for a variety of reasons, including potential 
confidentiality concerns and incomplete 
awareness of NCMEC’s resources, 
children missing from care have not been 
consistently reported to NCMEC in the 
past. As of April 2015, three states and one 
large county child welfare agency – Florida, 
Illinois, Texas and Los Angeles County in 
California – have established relationships 
with NCMEC to report children missing from 
care directly to NCMEC. The recent passage 
of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and 
Strengthening Families Act closes this gap 
by requiring all child welfare agencies to 
develop policies and procedures including 
making a report to NCMEC.
While the law allows for a two year period 
to develop and implement these reporting 
measures, judges and court officials can 
play an important role in immediately 
advising and developing a framework for 
a more coordinated response among law 
enforcement and juvenile justice and child 
welfare agencies. Together stakeholders can 
dispel commonly persisting misconceptions 
and define roles and responsibilities to streamline coordination and act quickly 
when there is a report of a missing child.
According to the Child Welfare League of 
America, a child is considered missing from 
a foster placement if “he or she is not in 
the physical custody of the child welfare 
agency or the person or institution with 
whom/which the agency placed the child. 
The whereabouts of the missing child may 
be known or unknown.”10 This umbrella 
category includes children who have run 
away and are abducted from foster care. 
Children may also go missing from juvenile 
justice settings or from home while under 
court monitoring. The moment children 
go missing, they are at risk for a myriad of 
significant and life-threatening dangers. In 
response, child serving agencies and judges 
should prioritize and utilize every resource 
and effort available to them with the goal 
of quickly locating all missing children and 
returning them to a safer environment, 
which includes immediately reporting 
the child missing to law enforcement and 
then contacting NCMEC for additional 
resources. And judges should consider 
the specific suggestions listed below as a 
roadmap for building such collaborations, if 
not already found within their jurisdictions, 
and maximizing collective resources in 
order to offer the best protection for these 
vulnerable children.
WHAT JUDGES CAN DO
Both at the individual case level and the 
community level, judges can establish 
swift action when children go missing from 
care by ensuring a coordinated response 
is in place. While some jurisdictions may

4Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDRENconsider running away from placement a 
change in the child’s status and require 
a hearing other jurisdictions may wait 
until the next scheduled court hearing to 
update the judiciary. Judges should ensure 
local child welfare and juvenile justice 
policies include requesting a court hearing 
immediately when a child is missing from 
placement. Judges may consider some of 
the following actions, depending on their 
jurisdiction’s particular laws, to encourage 
diligent efforts are being undertaken to 
locate a missing child:
Require agencies  take a current 
photograph of the child and maintain an 
easily accessible electronic copy within 
agency records.
Issue an order requiring the agency 
with whom the child was placed take 
the following steps when a child goes 
missing:
• Report immediately to law enforcement 
if the child goes missing from 
placement or runs away and provide 
documentation of the report to the 
court;
• Provide the following information to law 
enforcement with the report, the child’s:
o Name;
o Date of birth;
o Height and weight;
o Description including any other 
unique identifiers such as tattoos, 
body piercings, eyeglasses, and/or 
braces;
o Clothing worn when went missing or 
was last seen; ando Current photograph.
• Ensure law enforcement authorities 
immediately enter the child’s name 
and identifying information into the 
FBI’s NCIC Missing Person File. Provide 
documentation of such to the court.
Judges can issue individual orders to 
social workers or juvenile justice workers 
or a standing order in their jurisdiction 
to report children missing from care to 
NCMEC,  which is available 24 hours a day. 
As mentioned previously, the recent passing 
of the federal Preventing Sex Trafficking 
and Strengthening Families Act into law 
requires child welfare agencies to report 
children missing from care to NCMEC. 
However, the law also allows for a two-year 
implementation timeframe with a deadline 
of October 2016. Judges can assist with 
issuing individual orders until their local 
child welfare agency officially adjusts their 
internal policy to comply with this federal 
requirement. Additionally, following the 
deadline, judges can play an important role 
in ensuring all children missing from care 
have been reported to law enforcement and 
separately to NCMEC and the child welfare 
agency remains in compliance with this 
federal statue. 
In the interim, such orders should clearly 
include the release of the child’s photo for 
purposes of creating a missing child poster. 
NCMEC does not include information on 
a missing child poster indicating the child 
is in state care or has any history of abuse, 
neglect, or involvement in the juvenile or 
child welfare systems. When the child’s legal Reports can be made to  
1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678).
5Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDRENguardian calls into NCMEC, in addition to 
sharing the same information listed above 
for the law enforcement report, additionally 
helpful information includes:
• Child’s cell phone number;
• Social networking sites the child is active 
on; and
• Information about friends or companions 
with whom the child may have gone 
missing.
Order agencies to take updated 
photographs of a child who returns to 
care from a runaway episode,  so any new 
physical attributes — including tattoos, 
piercings, hairstyles — are documented. 
Photos should be taken under conditions 
promoting the safety of the child so as not 
to re-traumatize children.
Consider requiring safety assessments 
of suspected sex trafficking victims 
are completed when a child returns.  
If applicable, judges can require the 
assessment be done prior to authorizing 
a transfer under the interstate compact, 
which facilitates the return of children found 
in another state to their state of residence. 
Additional considerations include:
• Assessment of immediate and long-term 
services needed by the victim;
• Coordination of trauma-informed 
and specialized services, particularly 
between the state where a child is 
located and where he or she was in care;
• Assessment of facility or home safety 
from which the child went missing; and
• Consideration of a safety plan to address 
the special dynamics of recruitment of a child for trafficking purposes.
Judges may consider continuing the 
child’s child welfare or juvenile justice 
placement even for children who reach 
the age of majority and are still missing 
or are missing for long periods of time, so 
those children can easily access services 
if and when they are located.  It may be 
possible in some jurisdictions for judges 
to deny the request of child welfare or 
juvenile justice agencies to discontinue 
the placement or custody of a missing 
child based on either the length of missing 
episode or their aging out of the system 
while missing. In some jurisdictions, an 
agency is required to exhaust all efforts to 
find the child, including making a report to 
NCMEC before the child’s 18th birthday. In 
these missing children cases NCMEC is an 
important safety net as their case will not be 
closed and NCMEC will continue to search 
for these children until they are recovered 
– even if the child remains missing after 
reaching the age of 18.
Ensure communication and collaboration. 
Some child welfare and juvenile justice 
agencies have expressed concern about 
how the obligation to report children 
to NCMEC impacts their obligations to 
protect that child’s confidentiality. NCMEC 
has established policies respecting 
confidentiality while sharing vital information 
relating to locating and recovering missing 
children. Most state child welfare laws 
and policies will require agencies caring 
for children make all reasonable efforts or 
efforts in the child’s best interest to assist 
with the location of a child missing from 
care. This kind of language allows state 
agencies responsible for missing children 
the discretion to report missing children and 
6Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDRENrelease the child’s photo and information 
when there is a valid protective purpose 
satisfying the applicable legal purposes. 
Judges can reduce or remove any barriers 
confidentiality may propose by setting clear 
expectations and meeting with stakeholders 
regarding any issues they may have.
WHEN A CHILD GOES MISSING 
FROM CARE: WHAT JUDGES NEED 
TO KNOW ABOUT HOW NCMEC 
WORKS
Children in foster care or juvenile detention 
are some of the most vulnerable to child 
traffickers. Judges presiding over juvenile 
justice and child welfare cases can play 
an important role in creating a better 
safety net for this vulnerable population 
of children by ensuring the free services 
of NCMEC are engaged. When children 
go missing, NCMEC employs a wide array 
of resources to assist law enforcement, 
families, and legal guardians in location 
and recovery efforts. While most juvenile 
justice and child welfare agencies routinely 
report children missing from care to law 
enforcement, they may not know reporting 
missing children to NCMEC can increase 
the likelihood they will be found.11 Of 
missing child cases reported to NCMEC 
since 1990, approximately 97 percent 
had been resolved as of the end of 2014. 
However, NCMEC can only assist when law 
enforcement or the child’s legal guardian 
calls NCMEC and reports the missing child.
When child welfare is acting as the legal 
11 As noted earlier NCMEC receives automatic 
reports from child welfare agencies of all children missing 
from foster care in three states, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and 
one jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California. A formal 
agreement is not necessary for a child welfare or juvenile 
justice agency to make reports to NCMEC.guardian in a child’s life, should that child go 
missing, NCMEC stands ready and willing to 
employ all available resources in supporting 
the search efforts of the child welfare 
agency in addition to law enforcement. 
Within the child welfare system there may 
be multiple individuals who have important 
information about the child to share such 
as social workers, foster parents, and group 
home staff. Working together to collect 
every piece of helpful information NCMEC 
case managers can assist child welfare 
agencies in strengthening their response 
for locating and recovering missing 
children. Additionally all information about 
historic and active missing child cases is 
maintained in NCMEC’s Missing Child 
Database. All past missing child information 
and case notes are reviewed to see if they 
can provide a window into the location 
of the active missing child. This can be 
especially helpful as social workers and law 
enforcement may be newly assigned or have 
changed since the last missing incident. 
It’s important to note, while NCMEC case 
managers remain in constant contact with 
the legal guardian, NCMEC is restricted 
from providing analytical information to 
anyone other than the assigned or searching 
law enforcement agency.
Once the missing child is reported, NCMEC 
takes the following steps. An NCMEC 
case management team is assigned to 
coordinate all resources available through 
NCMEC to assist with identifying and 
recovering missing children. NCMEC 
analysts will conduct comprehensive 
searches for all information provided about 
the missing child, companions, or potential 
offenders. While law enforcement is actively 
searching for missing children, NCMEC’s 
7Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDRENrole includes providing analytical and 
technical assistance. The agency responsible 
for the missing child can also benefit from 
additional resources available to parents 
and guardians through NCMEC, including 
support services and referral assistance.
NCMEC supports the search efforts of law 
enforcement in the jurisdiction where the 
child went missing and broadens the safety 
net for recovery beyond that jurisdiction. 
Missing children do not always remain 
within the jurisdiction where they originally 
go missing. This is especially true in cases of 
children who are exploited through online 
enticement or targeted by sex traffickers 
where traffickers may move their victims 
from city to city or even across state lines 
to evade detection by law enforcement. 
NCMEC can support law enforcement in 
identifying online information indicating any 
travel or movement outside of the missing 
location and connect law enforcement 
resources in relevant jurisdictions. 
NCMEC has established contacts with law 
enforcement professionals in every state 
who work specifically on child recovery and 
can assist with aligning these efforts in the 
most efficient way for law enforcement and 
safest way for the child.
After the legal guardian has reported the 
child missing to law enforcement and 
NCMEC, any noncustodial individual can 
call NCMEC 24 hours a day to provide 
additional information about the missing 
child case.12 Additional helpful information 
12 NCMEC is dedicated to upholding the highest 
level of safety and confidentiality for the missing child. 
Information provided by individuals who are not the legal 
guardian or law enforcement will be received and processed; 
however, NCMEC will not provide information or case 
updates to these individuals. Outgoing information from 
NCMEC is communicated only to legal guardians and law 
enforcement.can include names of friends in the 
community or group home the child is close 
with or may be missing with, additional 
phone numbers, social networking sites the 
child uses, information about companions 
such as boyfriends or girlfriends, and names 
of places the child frequents or possibly 
hangs out.
Every runaway incident matters to NCMEC 
no matter how long the child has been 
missing. Information about the child and 
circumstances surrounding the incident, or 
past incidents, can provide a current set of 
indicators to assist with the child’s recovery. 
Additionally, once an intake has been 
completed on a child and the information 
is entered into NCMEC’s system, the child 
is never forgotten. NCMEC will continue to 
assist in the search until the child is found. 
This can be especially important for children 
who are missing from care because missing 
children do not “age out” of the services 
NCMEC provides. In these situations 
NCMEC case managers continue to be an 
advocate for the child and provide ongoing 
support for law enforcement’s efforts until 
the child is recovered regardless of whether 
the child turns 18 while missing.
JUDICIAL LEADERSHIP TO BUILD A 
COLLABORATIVE RESPONSE
Addressing child sex trafficking is a high-
priority issue for the National Council of 
Juvenile and Family Court Judges and 
National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children, because children who have 
been reported missing and are under 
the oversight of a judge, are often also 
at risk of being exploited. It is imperative 
a coordinated response be put in place, 
as it is the responsibility of multiple 
8Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDRENsystems, national and local organizations 
to establish a better safety net for children 
involved in the child welfare and juvenile 
justice systems.
Judges can play a leadership role to bring 
stakeholders together including child 
welfare and juvenile justice agencies and 
law enforcement to review their policies 
to determine how NCMEC and other local 
and national organizations can be included 
as a crucial resource in their efforts to bring 
children home safely. It is the responsibility 
of all agencies and organizations 
dedicated to protecting children to expand 
conversations in an effort to connect 
systems, eliminate barriers, and streamline 
responses when a child is missing. When we 
fail to communicate and share information 
that can lead to the protection and 
recovery of a child, we create gaps allowing traffickers and other offenders to target and 
exploit these vulnerable children. Judges 
have the oversight role to minimize or 
diminish these gaps by acting with urgency 
and developing a coordinated response 
when children go missing from care.
The National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children along with the National Council 
of Juvenile and Family Court Judges stand 
ready to engage in any further conversations 
with members of the judiciary about 
the development of model policies and 
procedures based on the recommendations 
in this brief. We look forward to providing 
ongoing technical assistance, as requested.

MISSING & EXPLOITED CHILDREN (NCMEC)
NCMEC maintains a database of 
information about every missing 
child reported to its Call Center. This 
comprehensive database includes 
information about the child, details of 
the missing/runaway incident, recovery information, law enforcement updates and 
important medical needs, endangerments 
and physical descriptors — including

The CyberTipline is an online reporting 
mechanism created for the public and 
electronic service providers to report 
incidents of child sexual exploitation. 
The CyberTipline receives approximately 
10,000 to 12,000 reports of apparent child 
victimization every week. More specifically, 
child sex trafficking analysts process more than 800 reports a month pertaining to 
possible child sex trafficking. The analysts 
utilize their specialized skills and access to 
multiple public records databases to add 
information to the CyberTipline reports 
and provide reports to law enforcement 
for review. All reports are archived and 
searched against incoming reports to see if 
connections can be made between online 
child victimization and a missing child.Missing Children, State Care, and Child Sex Trafficking: Engaging the Judiciary in Building a Collaborative ResponseNATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES & NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN
