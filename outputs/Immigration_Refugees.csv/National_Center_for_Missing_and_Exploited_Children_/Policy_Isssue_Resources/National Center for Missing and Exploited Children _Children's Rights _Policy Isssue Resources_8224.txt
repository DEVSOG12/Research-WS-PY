Bark Technologies 6612020 CyberTipline Reports by  
Electronic Service Providers (ESP)
NCMEC’s CyberTipline is the nation’s centralized reporting system for the online exploitation 
of children, including child sexual abuse material, child sex trafficking and online enticement. 
In 2020, the CyberTipline received more than 21.7 million reports. 21.4 million of these reports 
were from Electronic Service Providers that report instances of apparent child sexual abuse 
material that they become aware of on their systems.
Higher numbers of reports can be indicative of a variety of things including larger numbers 
of users on a platform or how robust an ESP’s efforts are to identify and remove abusive 
content. NCMEC applauds ESPs that make identifying and reporting this content a priority and 
encourages all companies to increase their reporting to NCMEC. These reports are critical to 
helping remove children from harmful situations and to stopping further victimization.
The following is a breakdown of reports by electronic service providers.
