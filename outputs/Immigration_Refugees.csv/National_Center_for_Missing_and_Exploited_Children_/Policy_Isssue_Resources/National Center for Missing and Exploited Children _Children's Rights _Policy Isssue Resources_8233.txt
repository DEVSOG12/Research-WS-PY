Many child abductions in the United States are committed by a parent or other
family member. An estimated 203,900 children were victims of family ab duc-
tion in the United States in 1999, according to the second National Incidence
Studies: Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children  (NISMART-2) , a
study published by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
(OJJDP), U.S. Department of Justice, in 2002.1 Children who are victims of family
abduction are uprooted from their homes and deprived of their other parent.
Often they are told the other parent no longer loves them or is dead. Too often
abducted children live a life of deception, sometimes under a false name, movingfrequently and lacking the stability needed for healthy, emotional development.
The term parental kidnapping  describes the wrongful removal or retention
of a child by a parent. Because child kidnappings are frequently committed byother family members, the term family abduction  more accurately describes
such action. Both terms are used interchangeably in this book. Both have civiland criminal meanings.
When a parental kidnapping occurs the government may pursue criminal
process against the abductor if a criminal law has been violated. Law en force-
ment and prosecutors are part of the criminal-justice system. The left-behindparent may pursue civil remedies to prevent an abduction or re cover a wrong-
fully removed or wrongfully retained child. The left-behind parent’s lawyer andthe family court are part of the civil-justice system. It is important to understandboth criminal and civil remedies can be pursued when an abduction occurs. Thedecision to pursue civil remedies is up to the parent, whereas the prosecutor ulti-mately has discretion whether to pursue criminal process.
This guide covers civil and criminal remedies in parental kidnapping cases.
It navigates parents and attorneys through the criminal- and civil-justice systems’responses to parental kidnapping. It describes actions parents can take and lawsthat may be helpful when their children are the victims of family abduction. It
also explains how to prevent abductions.
Parents should take this book with them when they meet with their
attor neys, law enforcement, prosecutors, and family-court personnel, many of
whom may be handling a family-abduction case for the first time.
Other sources of information about parental-kidnapping cases are available
to law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges handling these cases. For instance
law enforcement may contact the National Center for Missing & ExploitedChildren
® for a free copy of Missing and Abducted Children: A Law-Enforcement
Guide to Case Investigation and Program Management. Other publications for par-
ents and concerned professionals are listed in the section titled “Bibliography”beginning on page 143.

xiiFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Family-Abduction
Prevention andAction Checklist
by Patricia M. Hoff
This chapter summarizes steps a parent can take to help prevent an abduction orrecover a child after an abduction. Each step is explained in the following chap-ters. As the checklist illustrates, a parent can seek relief, often simultaneously,from the civil courts, governmental agencies, and the criminal-justice system.
A parent is responsible for getting and enforcing a custody determination
through the courts. Typically a parent hires a private attorney to help with theprocess though parents can appear pro se , or without an attorney, in court as well.
A parent may also go to court for measures to prevent abduction or hold anabductor and/or accomplices civilly liable for damages resulting from the abduc-tion. A parent may also seek assistance from various agencies with civil remedieswhen his or her child has been abducted. Such agencies include a missing-childclearinghouse and in an international-abduction case from the Missing ChildrenDivision of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
® and the Office
of Children’s Issues (OCI) at the U.S. Department of State.
Law enforcement and prosecutors in all levels of government are responsible
for investigating and prosecuting parental-kidnapping crimes. Typically a left-behind parent’s role is to bring the case to the attention of law enforcement whoseresponse will reflect both mandatory duties and discretionary authority. Forexample law enforcement has a mandatory federal duty to enter information
about each missing-child case into the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National
Crime Information Center-Missing Person File (NCIC-MPF) within two hours ofreport receipt.
2 Whether a parent will be prosecuted for abduction lies within the
discretion of prosecutors. Each parental-kidnapping case is unique, and strategicdecisions are made based on the facts of the case and personalities of all involvedas to whether criminal process should be used along with civil remedies. Oncelaw-enforcement authorities and/or prosecutors become involved in a case, theymay call upon a parent in connection with the investigation or criminal trial.A parent may request status reports about the case, but law-enforcementauthorities will not release sensitive information that might jeopardize anongoing investigation.
2The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Adam Walsh Act), Pub. L. No. 109-248 mandates
law enforcement entry of information about missing and abducted children into NCIC within two hours ofreceipt of the report.
FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 1P & A Checklist- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEP & A ChecklistFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Preventing an Abduction
Go to court and obtain a custody determination specifically defining cus tody
and visitation rights and clearly stating the basis for the court’s jurisdic-
tion and manner in which notice and opportunity to be heard were givento the parties.
If there is a risk of abduction, ask the court to include prevention measures in
the custody order. Provide the court with evidence establishing a credible
risk of abduction in your  case, and request prevention measures tailored
to your  case.
Abduction risk factors and personality profiles of potential abductors, as
well as abduction-prevention measures, are discussed in the chapter titled
“Preventing Abductions” beginning on page 9. By way of example,abduction risk factors include past abductions or abduction threats, lackof economic or familial ties to a child’s home state, and evidence of abduc-tion planning activities.
Check laws in your jurisdiction for abduction-prevention statutes. A few
jurisdictions already have such laws and others may soon enact the
recently completed Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act. In theabsence of specific prevention statutes, judges may enter preventionorders to protect children.
Abduction-prevention measures include supervised visitation, posting a bond,
entering a child’s name in the Passport Issuance Alert Program, and surren-
dering a child’s passport(s) to the court.
Parents can take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of abduction.
These are discussed in the chapter titled “Preventing Abductions” beginning
on page 9. Some examples are to notify your child’s school or daycare ofcustody orders, flag passport applications for your child, and teach your childto use the telephone to call for help.
If Your Child Is Abducted
Once you are sure your child has been abducted, immediately call or go to
your local law-enforcement agency and file a missing-person report. Com-
plete the “Missing-Person Report for an Abducted Child” on page 261, andbring it with you when going to your local law-enforcement agency.
Ask law enforcement to enter information about your child into the FBI’s NCIC.
Federal law requires law enforcement to enter each missing-child case into NCIC
within two hours of report receipt. Relevant sections of the applicable laws –Missing Children Act, National Child Search Assistance Act, and Adam Walsh
Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 – are reprinted respectively be gin-
ning on pages 155, 157, and 158. Bring this guide with you when meeting withlaw-enforcement authorities and show them these Acts. Law enforcement willdecide if the circumstances of a child’s disappearance meet the protocol for acti-vation of an America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alertand/or other community notification.
Report your child missing to the National Center for Missing & Exploited
Children (NCMEC) by calling toll-free at 1-800-THE-LOST® (1-800-843-5678).
Visit NCMEC’s website at www.missingkids.com.
3- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEVerify law enforcement has made the NCIC entry. If you cannot get this
information from your local law-enforcement agency, call NCMEC toll-
free at 1- 800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) and ask them to check NCIC
to see if your child is listed. NCMEC can confirm NCIC entries but is notauthorized to make them.
If law enforcement does not enter information about your child into NCIC,
your missing-child clearinghouse may be able to help by contacting law
enforcement about your case. See the missing-child clearinghouse list in the
section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws and
Resources” beginning on page 199 or contact NCMEC for additional infor-mation. You can also ask your local FBI office to enter information about yourchild into NCIC. The Missing Children Act authorizes the FBI to make such
entries. Contact information for the FBI is available in your local telephone
book and at www.fbi.gov. From the home page click on the “Your Local FBIOffice” link.
If you suspect your child has been taken out of the country, call NCMEC toll-
free at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) and the U.S. Department of State’s
Office of Children’s Issues toll-free at 1-888-407-4747 or by dialing directly at202-736-9090 for advice about what to do. Find out if you have a remedyunder the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International ChildAbduction (Hague Convention). If you do, consider filing an applicationunder the Hague Convention for your child’s return. If you do not have a
passport, apply for one in the event you have to travel outside of the United
States to recover your child. Visit the U.S. Department of State’s website atwww.travel.state.gov, and click on the “ Apply for a Passport” link.
If your child is in the process of being abducted internationally by a family
member, contact the Office of Children’s Issues without delay  toll-free at
1-888-407-4747 or by dialing directly at 202-736-9090. Also call NCMEC toll-
free at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) and the FBI. Contact informationfor the FBI is available in your local telephone book and at www.fbi.gov. Fromthe home page click on the “Your Local FBI Office” link.
If your child has been taken out of this country, or is in the process of being
taken out of the country, report the abduction to your local FBI office. Ask to
speak to the FBI’s Crimes Against Children Coordinator. The FBI has jurisdic-tion to investigate violations of the federal International Parental KidnappingCrime Act (IPKCA).
If an international abduction is in progress, urge law enforcement to immedi-
ately contact the U.S. National Central Bureau (USNCB)-INTERPOL for help
in intercepting the abductor. USNCB-INTERPOL does not respond to requestsdirectly from parents. Law-enforcement agencies may contact USNCB-INTERPOL directly or through the INTERPOL State Liaison Office.Law-enforcement agencies in the United States may contact USNCB-INTERPOL directly through Nlets, The International Justice and Public Safety
Network, at DCINTER00. Parents concerned about an abduction-in-progressshould also immediately contact NCMEC; OCI; transportation carriers theabductor may use such as airlines, train and bus companies; and local law-
enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of ficials
at airports and other transportation facilities the abductor may use. Put them
4FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -on notice of the imminent abduction and request help in preventing your
child’s removal from the country. Provide a photograph of your child andsuspected abductor if available. Please remember abductors may useremote or distant transportation facilities instead of those closest tothe ab duction site.
Contact your missing-child clearinghouse and any local nonprofit, missing-
children organization (NPO) for whatever assistance they may provide.
Consult the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Lawsand Resources,” beginning on page 199, for information about the missing-child clearinghouse and NPOs in your area. Referrals to other NPOs areavailable from the Association of Missing and Exploited Childrens Organiza-tions Inc. (AMECO) by calling toll-free at 1-877-263-2620, dialing directly at
703-838-8379, or visiting www.amecoinc.org.
If you do not already have a custody order, immediately get one. Consider
hiring a lawyer to help you. A temporary custody order  is usually enough to
get help from law-enforcement authorities at least until your child is located.
You do not need a custody order to file a missing-person report or have yourchild’s description entered into NCIC. A court can issue a custody order evenif your child has been abducted from your jurisdiction or outside of the coun-try and you were never legally married to the abductor. If the abductor’s
whereabouts are unknown, making it impossible for you to serve him or her
personally with notice of the lawsuit, you are allowed to give notice by publi-cation. The sooner you act the more likely it is you can prevent the abductorfrom getting a valid custody determination from another jurisdiction or coun-try. This in turn will make it easier for you to enforce your custody order andrecover your child.
If you already have a custody order get additional copies from the court. It is
helpful to have at least one, but preferably two or three, certified  copies avail-
able to show or give to law-enforcement and other agencies.
Consider asking law enforcement or the prosecutor to file criminal chargesagainst the abductor. Weigh the pros and cons of such action. You must be
prepared to press charges after your child is re turned. In some interna-
tional-abduction cases foreign judges applying the Hague Convention willnot return a child to the United States if criminal charges are pending in thiscountry against the abductor. If you want to press charges meet personallywith the local prosecutor to discuss prosecution. Be aware that the criminallaw in your jurisdiction or the jurisdiction in which your child is located mayor may not cover the abductor’s conduct. Citations to criminal laws can be
found in the section titled “Nationwide  Directory of Family-Abduction Laws
and Resources,” beginning on page 199. Even if the abductor is criminally
charged and government is proceeding against the abductor, you shouldbe prepared to bring a civil action in court to enforce your custody orderwhen the child is located.
If the prosecutor charges the abductor with a felony, law-enforcement
authorities should promptly enter the felony warrant into NCIC. NCIC files

Contact the crime victims’ assistance office in your jurisdiction, as well as
the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) in the federal government, to find

After Your Child is Located
To facilitate enforcement of your custody order, file or register your custody
order with the local family court in the jurisdiction where your child is
located. Follow procedures set forth in the law of that jurisdiction. If the Uni-form Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) is in effect, send a certifiedcopy of your custody order to the clerk of the court for filing. Under theUCCJA, once filed, a sister-jurisdiction order is entitled to be enforced as if itwere a local order. If the jurisdiction in which your child is located has enacted
the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA),
streamlined procedures in that law allow, but do not require, you to regis-
ter your custody order. Registration is designed to simplify and expediteenforcement proceedings at a later date. A registered child-custody order canbe enforced as if it were a local custody order.
Ask local law-enforcement authorities to help with the recovery. The UCCJEA
in many jurisdictions authorizes prosecutors, and law enforcement acting on
their request, to assist with civil enforcement of custody orders. This statu-tory role is discretionary, however, and they may not get involved. In somejurisdictions law enforcement may assist based on custom and practice orwritten guidelines. In many jurisdictions, however, local law enforcementwill not help recover an abducted child without a local court order. Filing orregistering your order, see above, should be sufficient for law enforcement
inclined to help.
It may be necessary to petition the court where your child is located to
enforce your custody order. A lawyer can help you do this. If notice of an
enforcement proceeding, or other court action such as registration, is likely tocause the abductor to flee with or endanger your child, you can ask the court
6FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -to issue a special pick-up order for your child. See the chapter titled “Recover-
ing Your Child” beginning on page 93.
If your child is located in another country, consider hiring an attorney in that
country to help recover your child. This may entail filing a petition for return
under the Hague Convention, if it is in effect, or an action ask ing the for-
eign court to enforce your U.S. order or issue its own custody order. Send
copies of your custody order and any criminal warrants for the abductor to
your attorney. Note:  Some Hague Convention countries provide counsel for
the applicant-parent.
Take steps to prevent a repeat abduction. Consider going back to court after
your child is recovered to limit the abductor’s visitation rights and add pre-
vention provisions to your custody decree to reduce the risk of another
abduction. See the chapter titled “Preventing Abductions” be ginning
on page 9.
Consider seeking psychological help for every family member to help withthe reunification process. See the chapter titled “Psychological Issues in
Recovery and Family Reunification” beginning on page 127.
Consider filing a child-snatching lawsuit against the abductor and anyaccomplices. See the chapter titled “Civil-Court Remedies If Your Child Is

by Patricia M. Hoff
Chapter Overview
This chapter explains what parents can do to help safeguard children against fam-
ily abduction. It focuses on special provisions that can be included in custody
orders to help prevent abduction. Knowing when to ask for preventive
measures, and which ones to request, is facilitated by an evaluation of three fac-
tors – the risk of abduction, obstacles to recovery, and potential harm to a child ifabducted. This information should be helpful to parents seeking to preventrepeat or threatened abductions, as well as to those who suspect the other parentmay be planning a first-time abduction. Below is a summary list of prevention
tips more fully discussed in this chapter.
1. You need a custody order specifying the rights of both parents with respect to
your child. Most jurisdictions call these rights “custody and visitation,”although some jurisdictions use different terminology. Consider hiring a law-
yer to help you.
2. Be sure the custody order clearly states the basis for the court’s jurisdiction
and manner in which notice and opportunity to be heard were given to theparties. This will facilitate interjurisdictional enforcement of custody and visi-
tation rights and the recovery of your abducted child.
3. If you are concerned about abduction, ask the judge to include prevention provisions
in the custody order. Your jurisdiction may be one of the few that already has abduc-tion-prevention laws such as the Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act (UCAPA).Other jurisdictions may soon enact UCAPA. Even in the absence of specific abduc-tion-prevention statutes, judges may enter prevention orders to protect children.
4. To decide which prevention measures to request, evaluate the risk of
abduc tion, obstacles you would encounter trying to recover your child, and
potential harm your child is likely to suffer if abducted. More restrictive pre-ventive measures will be needed when the risk of abduction is high, obstacles
to recovering your child would be difficult to overcome, and ab duction is
likely to be harmful to your child.
5. How can you tell if there is a risk of abduction? Consider the list of “red flag”
indicators of abduction risk and six personality profiles listed below. Onecaveat is the absence of these indicators does not mean an abduction will notoccur and their presence does not guarantee an abduction will occur. Theremay be an increased likelihood of abduction if a parent has
Previously abducted or threatened to abduct your child
No strong ties to the jurisdiction in which your child lives
Friends or relatives living in another state, territory, or country
A strong support network
No job, is able to work anywhere, or is financially independent – in otherwords is not tied to the area for financial reasons
Engaged in planning activities such as quitting a job; selling a home;terminating a lease; closing a bank account or liquidating other assets;hiding or destroying documents; applying for a pa ssport and/or visa,

6. While there may be no way to know for sure if a parent will abduct his or her
child, six personality profiles have been identified by social scientists3 that may be
helpful in predicting which parents may pose a risk of abduction.Profile  l Parents who have threatened to abduct or abducted previously
Profile 2 Parents who suspect or believe abuse has occurred andfriends and relatives support these beliefs
Profile 3 Parents who are paranoid delusionalProfile 4 Parents who are severely sociopathicProfile 5 Parents who are citizens of another country, or dual citizens
of the United States and another country, with strong tiesto the country of origin and in a mixed-culture marriagethat is ending
Profile 6 Parents who feel alienated from the legal system and have
family/social support in another community
7. You may ask the court to include prevention provisions in a custody order
such as
Specific statement of custody and visitation rights; avoid terms such as“reasonable visitation”
Supervised visitation
Bonds and other guarantees
Joint-custody orders – avoid in parental abduction and family violencecases; if ordered, specify residential arrangements for the child
Prohibition on unauthorized pick-up of child
Authorization for law-enforcement assistance to recover an abducted child
Relocation restrictions on custodial parent with the child
Restrictions on removal of the child from his or her home state, territory, orcountry such as surrendering passports; prohibiting passport applications;notifying foreign consulate of passport restrictions; putting in place mirror-image orders; requiring assurances of return from foreign visits; and definingterms in the custody order in conformance with the Hague Convention onthe Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention)
8. Practical steps parents can take to reduce the risk of abduction
Taking pictures of your child
Keeping a complete written description of your child
Making a record of your child’s Social Security Number (SSN)
Having your child fingerprinted
Teaching your child to use the telephone
Seeking counseling
Asking law enforcement or the prosecutor to intervene
Notifying schools, daycare centers, and babysitters of custody orders
Making lists of information regarding the child and other parent
Filing/Registering the custody order where the noncustodial parent lives
Flagging passport applications for your child
Treating child support and visitation as separate issues

- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 10Preventing 
Abductions FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Get a Valid, Enforceable Custody Order
It is important for a parent who is trying to prevent an abduction to get a valid
custody order from a court with jurisdiction to make such an order. A w ell-
written custody order not only defines the rights and responsibili ties of both
parents with respect to their child, but also is often critical to recovering a child
after an abduction. Special provisions can be included in custody orders
– both original and modification orders – to help prevent abduction.
To make or modify a custody order a court must have jurisdiction under
law, the UCCJA or UCCJEA, over custody mat ters and notice must be given
to the parties. The court’s exercise of jurisdiction must also comply with the
Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), in order for its custody determina-tion to be eligible for “full faith and credit” or enforcement nationwide as a matterof federal law. These laws and the process for getting and enforcing valid custodydeterminations are described in the chapter titled “Civil-Court Remedies If YourChild Is Abducted” beginning on page 23.
Most parents retain a lawyer to obtain a custody order, whether it is an origi-
nal order or a modification of an existing order. A lawyer can also assist in gettinga custody order enforced and your child returned. Your attorney may work witha lawyer in another jurisdiction or country if you have to bring enforcement
proceedings in another jurisdiction. Your lawyer can also help you requestthe filing of criminal charges against the abductor if such action is desirableand then advocate for investigation and prosecution.
Your jurisdiction may be one of the few that already has abduction-preven-
tion laws. Consult the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction
Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199. Many other jurisdictions may soon
enact the recently completed Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act (UCAPA)available at www.nccusl.org. From the home page click on the “Final Acts &Legislation” link. Then in the “Select an Act Title” field select “Child AbductionPrevention,” and then click on the “Search” button. This act is also reprintedbeginning on page 191. These laws provide parents and courts with guidanceabout when abduction-prevention measures are needed and which preventionmeasures may be ordered. Parents seeking prevention measures and their law-yers should read UCAPA. Even in the absence of specific abduction-prevention
statutes, judges may enter abduction-prevention orders to protect children.
Prevention Provisions in the Custody Order
Specific provisions can be included in custody orders to help protect against
abduction and deter violations of the order. If the original order does not includeprevention provisions you may go back to court to modify the order. This entailsfiling a petition in which you ask a court with modification jurisdiction to orderspecific preventive measures. Under both the UCCJEA and PKPA the jurisdic-tion that issued the original custody order has exclusive continuing modificationjurisdiction so long as specified conditions are met.
Often the risk of abduction arises before there is a custody order. If circum-
stances permit, promptly seek temporary custody with prevention provisions. Inexigent circumstances, such as when an abduction is in progress, courts in manyjurisdictions will issue temporary emergency relief, for instance an injunction, toprevent an abduction even before custody has been determined. As a general rule
11- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEany relief the court grants on an emergency basis is temporary. The next step is to
get a custody order incorporating safeguards on a more permanent basis.
Be careful about the provisions you ask the court for because too many
restrictions may be counterproductive. For instance making visitation too infre-quent, structured, or impersonal may exacerbate tensions between the parents
and actually lead to rather than prevent an abduction. Also consider your child’s
needs and feelings. Even if your child was previously abducted, he or she may
have a close, caring rela tionship with the abducting parent despite the emo-
tional pain and distress you experienced. Counseling may help your family arriveat an acceptable compromise.
Making the Case for Prevention Provisions
Be prepared to persuade the judge the prevention measures you seek are neces-sary. Focus your argument on the three factors of risk of abduction ; obstacles to
location, recovery, and return if your child is abducted ; and potential harm
to your child if abducted .
Risk of Abduction  Risk factors that may increase the chances of a child being
abducted include having a parent who has
Previously abducted or threatened to abduct your child
No strong ties to the jurisdiction in which your child lives
Friends or relatives living in another state, territory, or country
A strong support network
No job, is able to work anywhere, or is financially independent – in other
words is not tied to the area for financial reasons
Engaged in planning activities such as quitting a job; selling a home; termi-
nating a lease; closing a bank account or liquidating other assets; hid ing or
destroying documents; applying for a passport and/or visa, birth certificates,
school or medical records; purchasing airline tickets for your child; or under-going plastic surgery to materially alter appearance
Experienced a change in immigration status affecting his or her rights to
remain in this country
A history of marital instability, lack of cooperation with the other parent,domestic violence, or child abuse
A criminal record
Caveat: The absence of these factors does not guarantee an abduction will not
occur and their presence does not make an abduction certain. While there may
be no way to know for sure if a parent will abduct his or her child, social scien-tists
4 have identified six personality profiles that may be helpful in predicting
which parents may pose a risk of abduction.

12FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -135Id.Profile Characteristics
1 Parents who have threatened to abduct or abducted previously
2 Parents who suspect or believe abuse has occurred and friends and relatives sup-

and another country, with strong ties to the country of origin and are in a mixed-
culture marriage that is ending
6 Parents who feel alienated from the legal system and have family/social support in
another community
Abducting parents across the six personality profiles share many common
characteristics. They are likely to deny or dismiss the value of the other parent to
the child. They believe they know what is best for the child; cannot see how orwhy they should share parenting with the other parent; and are likely to havevery young children who are easy to transport and conceal and who are also
unlikely to protest verbally or tell others of their plight. With the exception of the
paranoid profile, abducting parents are apt to have the financial and moral sup-port from a network of family members, friends, and/or cultural or undergroundgroups. Many abductors do not consider their actions illegal or morally wrong.Mothers and fathers are equally likely to abduct, though at different times –fathers before a court order and mothers after an order has been issued.

at risk of abducting their children outlined above are described in detail in Early

Obstacles to Locating and Recovering Your Parentally Abducted Children  A parent may
encounter legal, procedural, cultural, and practical obstacles to recovering his or
her abducted child. In family abduction cases, lack of funds is a common barrierto hiring lawyers and financing searches. Local statutes may not provide adequateremedies, making it harder to recover a child. The failure of law-enforcementagencies to take a missing-child report, make an NCIC entry, or actively investi-
gate a family abduction can be major obstacles to locating an ab ducted child
and also violate mandates stipulated in the Missing Children Act, National ChildSearch Assistance Act, and Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.
International abductions to countries that have not yet ratified the Hague
Convention may present difficult obstacles if the “abducted-to” country doesnot recognize court orders issued in the United States; favors its own nationals;or awards custody based on religious, cultural, or gender grounds.

try Specific Fliers” links.
Abductions to most countries that are parties to the Hague Convention present
fewer obstacles because a legal remedy exists to seek a child’s return. Some HagueConvention countries, however, are non-compliant with the Hague Conventionand may pose obstacles to return.

Then respectively click on the “Resources”and most recently posted “Report on Compliance with the Hague AbductionConvention” links.
Potential Harm to the Child  Family abduction has been characterized as a form of
child abuse because of the harmful effects it has on children. Abducted childrenmay be forced to lead a fugitive life under assumed names, sometimes withaltered appearances, and kept out of school to avoid detection. The abductor maytell them the left-behind parent abandoned them, does not love them, or is dead.They may be neglected by their abductors and indoctrinated to fear law-enforce-ment officers and other adults who might help them. These and other problems
experienced by abducted children are discussed in the chapter titled “Psychologi-
cal Issues in Recovery and Family Reunification” beginning on page 127. Inaddi tion to possible long-term psychological harm, abducted children may be
physically harmed at the time of the abduction as well as during the period ofconcealment. Parents most likely to harm their children are those who have seri-ous mental and personality disorders, a history of violence or abuse, or little or noprior relationship with their child.

Weighing the Factors  Strict preventive measures are warranted when the risk of
abduction is high, a child is likely to be harmed, and/or the obstacles to recoverywould be difficult to overcome. Less restrictive measures may suffice when therisk of abduction is low, the likelihood of location and recovery high, and there islittle or no projected harm to the child.
Sample Prevention Provisions
To simplify enforcement of custody and visitation orders in the United Statesand facilitate reco very after an abduction, every well-written custody order should
clearly state the
Basis for the court’s exercise of jurisdiction and
Manner in which notice and opportunity to be heard were givenFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -In addition to these provisions, which belong in every  custody order, con-
sider the prevention safeguards noted below either alone or in combination.
Specify Custody and Visitation Rights  Clearly state the custody and visitation rights
of each party, including grandparents who have been granted visitation.
Avoid vague language such as “reasonable visitation.” Parents may not agree
about what is “reasonable,” which can lead to conflict, and authorities may
be unwilling to intervene when court orders are vague. Specify when visita-
tion begins and ends including days and times. The order should identify the
parent with whom the child will spend birthdays, school vacations, and major
holidays. Specify the child’s residential arrangements at all times.
State the Penalties for Violating the Order  Include a provision, prominently placed
on the first page of the order, plainly stating violation of the order may subject theparty in violation to civil and/or criminal penalties. Also ask the judge to advisethe parties, while they are in court, about the possible consequences of violatingthe order.
Supervised Visitation  Some situations warrant supervised visitation such as when
an abduction has previously occurred or abduction threats have been made, whendomestic violence or child abuse are alleged, or where the possibility exists thechild will be abducted to a country from which recovery would be difficult. Askthe judge to allow visits only at designated times and places such as the custodial
parent’s home; a supervised visitation center; or under the supervision of a person
designated by the court such as a social worker, member of the clergy, or relative.
To find a supervised visitation center in your area, visit the website of the
Supervised Visitation Network at www.svnetwork.net or call 904-389-7800.
Bonds and Other Guarantees  When there is a risk of child abduction or noncompli-
ance with the provisions of a custody order, it may be wise to ask the court torequire a parent to post a bond or give some other security or guarantee to helpensure compliance with its orders and/or the child’s continued presence in orreturn to the jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have enacted laws governing issu-ance of bonds in child-custody cases. These laws are listed in the section titled
“Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws and Resources” begin ning
on page 199. Bonds may also be available in other jurisdictions that have not yetenacted specific laws; however, they may not be available in all jurisdictions.
A parent can request the court in an initial custody proceeding to order the
other parent to post a bond. If certain circumstances arise after the court hasissued its initial order a parent may file a motion with a court that has modifi-
cation jurisdiction. Such circumstances could include abduction threats ornew plans to exercise visitation in an other country. The parent requesting a
bond should be prepared to present persuasive evidence there is a risk ofabduction or future violation of the custody/visitation order.
The amount of the bond should be sufficient to deter an abduction or other
violation of the custody or visitation provisions of a court order, taking intoaccount the financial circumstances of the parent who must post it, the “obligor.”A wealthy parent may be required to post a substantial cash bond. As an alterna-tive to a cash bond a parent of limited means may be ordered to deposit with the
15- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 16court title to real estate or personal property such as a car. The property would be
held in escrow pending compliance with the order and/or return of the child. Theparent whose custody or visitation rights are protected by the bond is known asthe obligee.
Generally if the obligor violates the conditions of the bond, the obligee  files a
motion with the court to hold the obligor in contempt and order payment orforfeiture of the bond. Upon court order the proceeds of the bond are released tothe obligee. The money is then available to the obligee to search for the child,
hire an attorney, bring legal proceedings to recover the child, or en force cus-
tody or visitation rights.
If the obligor is ordered to post a bond in connection with a civil proceeding,
the bond remains in effect for as long as the civil judge orders. If a parent isdirected to post a bond in connection with a criminal proceeding, such a bondremains in effect for no longer than the period of criminal punishment.
After consultation with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
®
(NCMEC), the Professional Bail Agents of the United States (PBUS) created achild-custody and visitation bond to be available to parents in high-risk situa-tions. PBUS trains agents and insurance agencies regarding use of these bonds.
For information about obtaining child-custody and visitation bonds in your
area, contact PBUS at 202-783-4120 or visit www.pbus.com.
Joint-Custody Orders  Joint custody is a valuable option for some families because
it allows both parents to actively participate in the upbringing of their children.Joint custody does not work, however, in all situations. If possible avoid jointcustody in cases where there is a history of family violence, parental kidnapping,friction between the parents; when an objection has been expressed by one parent to
joint custody; or when the parents live in different jurisdictions or countries.
Whenever joint custody is ordered, the custody order should clearly specify
the child’s residential arrangements at all times. This is particularly important for
enforcement purposes. Courts need to know what they are enforcing, and law-enforcement officers are reluctant to intervene in alleged custodial-interferencecases when court orders are vague about where, and with whom, the child issupposed to be.
Authorize Law-Enforcement Assistance  Many law-enforcement officers are unclear
about their role in preventing and responding to parental-kidnapping cases. Aprovision in the custody order directing law-enforcement officers to take specificactions may produce faster, more effective assistance. One useful provisionwould direct law enforcement to “accompany and assist” the left-behind par-ent in recovering his or her child. Another would authorize law enforcementto recover the child.
Prohibit Unauthorized Pick-Up of the Child  Prohibit the noncustodial parent from
picking up the child from school, daycare centers, and babysitters, unless thecustodial parent gives written permission.
Restrict Noncustodial Parent’s Right to Remove the Child from the Jurisdiction
or Country  Include a provision in the custody order prohibiting the noncustodial
parent from removing the child from the jurisdiction, the country, or bothFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -17with out prior consent of the court or written consent of the custodial parent. A
provision in the order restricting the child’s removal from the United States will
enable a parent to request the U.S. Department of State not to issue a U.S. pass-port for the child. Be advised such a provision will not prevent another countryfrom issuing a passport for a child who is also a national of that country. Parents
can, however, ask the other country to restrict issuance of a passport. Other coun-
tries may do so at their discretion.
Restrict the Custodial Parent’s Right to Relocate With the Child  A noncustodial
parent may desire a provision in the custody order requiring the custodial parentto get consent from the noncustodial parent or court before moving away withthe child. The restriction may cover domestic or international moves. Thenoncusto dial parent may be concerned the child will be moved so far away that
meaningful access is restricted or the child will be relocated to a country that will
not honor a U.S. custody order. Note: A provision giving a noncustodial parent
the right to be consulted about where the child lives may be interpreted by somecourts as a right of custody within the meaning of the Hague Convention, whichin turn would give a noncustodial parent the right to seek the child’s returnunder the Hague Convention.
There is a growing body of law concerning the right of a custodial parent to
relocate with his or her child. The trend is in favor of allowing relocation. There-fore, before seeking restrictions on the custodial parent’s right to relocate with thechild, noncustodial parents and their lawyers should review the law to determinewhat standards, tests, and/or presumptions apply.
Ideally, if the custodial parent plans to move, both parents should discuss
what effect this will have on visitation. Litigation may be avoided if the parentscan agree on the move and necessary adjustments to the visitation sched-
ule. De pending on the distances involved it may be practical to have fewer but
longer visits. For instance it may be better for the child to spend summers andmajor holidays with the noncustodial parent and the school year with the custo-dial parent. It is also a good idea to consider dividing the increased costs ofvisiting be tween the parents or allocating those costs to the parent who is moving
away, instead of leaving the full burden on the noncustodial parent. If these issues
are anticipated at the time the original order is made, that order can expressly
permit the custodial parent to move with the child and indicate how visitationwill change, if at all, in the event of a move. Otherwise the original order willhave to be modified to reflect changes in visitation. The order should alsorequire the parents to keep each other informed of their new addresses andtelephone numbers.
Preventing International Abductionsand Wrongful Retentions
The provisions noted below, alone or in combination, may also help deterinternational abductions and wrongful retentions in other countries. Someprovisions are geared toward preventing removal of a child from this country.Others are intended to help ensure a child’s return to this country after a
lawful visit to another country. Also see the chapter titled “International Child
Abduction,” beginning on page 105, for more information about this topic.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 18The U.S. Department of State’s website at www.travel.state.gov provides
information about preventing international, parental, child abduction. From
the home page click on the “Children & Family” link. Under the “International
Parental Child Abduction” heading click on the “Guarding against & respondingto parental child abduction” link. Then respectively click on the “Prevention,”
and “Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program” links.
Prevention measures include
Restricting a child’s removal from the United States.
Surrendering passports and other travel documents. The custody order
can direct the noncustodial parent to surrender his or her passport(s) and
other travel documents, as well as any passports or other travel documents forthe child in his or her possession, before visiting the child. The court may
order passports surrendered to, among others, the custodial parent, the court,
the clerk of the court, or the party’s attorney.
Prohibiting issuance of new or replacement passport for a child. Regulations
reduce the possibility a passport issued in the United States could be
obtained to further an abduction. The law and accompanying regulationsrequire any person applying for a U.S. passport for a child younger than 16 todemonstrate both parents’ consent to its issuance or the applicant-parent hassole authority to obtain a passport for a child.
To prevent issuance of a new or replacement passport for your child,
seek a court order or provision in a custody order prohibiting the otherparent from applying for a passport on the child’s behalf. Send a copy ofyour court order to the Office of Children’s Issues, U.S. Department ofState, 2201 C Street, Northwest, SA-29, Washington, DC 20520-2818. Theymay be reached by calling toll-free at 1-888-407-4747, dialing directly at202-736-9090, and via fax at 202-736-9132.
You should also ask the Office of Children’s Issues to enter information
about your child into the Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program. See
“Flag Passport Applications” on page 22 for additional information about
this program.
More information about restricting the issuance of passports is available
in the chapter titled “International Child Abduction” beginning on page 105.
Passport information is also available at www.travel.state.gov. From the homepage click on the “Children & Family” link. Under the “International Paren-tal Child Abduction” heading click on the “Guarding against & responding toparental child abduction” link. Then respectively click on the “Prevention,”and “Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program” links.
Note:  Foreign governments are not bound by custody orders issued by
courts in the United States and may issue passports to children who are theirnationals and visas to children who are not. You can, however, ask a foreignembassy or consulate not to issue a passport or visa to your child. Send theembassy or consulate a written request along with certified copies of any courtorders you have addressing custody or international travel regarding yourchild. You should copy the U.S. Department of State on any letter you send.There is no legal mandate for foreign governments to comply with U.S. courtorders or requests, but they may do so voluntarily.
Notifying foreign consulate of passport restrictions.  The court order may
require the foreign parent to notify his or her embassy or consulate of theFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -order prohibiting the issuance of a new or replacement passport for a child.
The court may further require the parent to furnish the court with a letterfrom the foreign embassy or consulate acknowledging receipt of a copy ofthe order. Although they are under no legal mandate to comply with U.S.court orders or requests, foreign governments may do so voluntarily.
Seeking mirror-image orders.  Before allowing your child to visit another
country, the court may require the noncustodial parent to obtain an order
from a court in the country where the visit is to occur recognizing the U.S.custody order and continuing jurisdiction of the U.S. court and agreeing toenforce the U.S. order in the event of a wrongful removal or retention. Alter-natively the foreign court may issue its own order with terms identical to theU.S. order.
Be aware foreign courts are not legally obligated to issue such an order.
Seeking a mirror-image order may be counterproductive in some countries,so before seeking this type of prevention measure it is advisable to consult anattorney in the foreign country about any “downside” risks. Although courtsin a few countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UnitedKingdom, may issue identical orders, courts in many countries may assumejurisdiction and enter their own custody orders, which may not conform toU.S. custody orders or ignore provisions conflicting with religious or otherinternal law. For example Islamic countries may not honor a U.S. order award-
ing custody to a mother under certain circumstances.
Seeking assurances of return from foreign visits.  When international visits
are to occur the parent in the United States may ask the court to order the
other parent to give assurances the child will be returned. Examples of suchassurances include requiring the noncustodial parent to provide the custodialparent with a copy of the child’s round-trip airline tickets, an open ticket forthe left-behind parent to travel to the country in case the child is not returned,addresses where the child will be, and telephone numbers of people with
whom the child will be staying.
Defining terms in the custody determination to facilitate use of the Hague
Convention. Under the Hague Convention custody rights are defined by the
law of the child’s country of habitual residence. In order for the Hague Con-
vention to apply the child must have been removed from, or retained outsideof, his or her country of habitual residence. To simplify application of theHague Convention the party in the United States should ask the court toinclude a provision declaring the United States to be the child’s habitualresidence. There is no assurance, however, a foreign court will treat adeclaration of “habitual residence” made by a court in the United Statesas binding.
A person with “custody rights” has the right to seek return under the
Hague Convention. The right to determine the child’s residence is considereda right of custody. If a noncustodial parent has the right to be consulted beforea child is taken to another country, he or she may  be deemed by some courts
to have “custody rights” and thus may seek the child’s return under the Hague
Convention. For this reason a noncustodial par ent may seek – and a custo-
dial parent may resist – a provision in a custody determination requiringconsultation and consent before the child is removed from the country. This
19- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 20was discussed under the section titled “Restrict the Custodial Parent’s Right to
Relocate with the Child” on page 17.
Practical Things Parents Can Do toReduce the Risk of Abduction
Take pictures of your child.  Take photographs of your child often. Be sure to
take profile shots as well as front poses. If possible buy your child’s schoolportraits every year and take videos. A photograph of the other parent mayalso be helpful in the event of an abduction.
Keep a complete written description of your child. This should include hair
and eye color; height; weight; date of birth; birthmarks; other unique physi-cal attributes; and other features such as glasses, contact lenses, braces,piercings, and tattoos.
Make a record of your child’s Social Security Number (SSN). Internal Rev-
enue Service rules require all children older than 1 year of age to have a SSN.You need a SSN to claim a child as a dependent on a tax return.
Have your child fingerprinted. Most law-enforcement agencies provide this
service at no charge, but they do not keep the child’s prints on file. You will begiven the only fingerprint card for safekeeping.
Teach your child to use the telephone. Teach your child his or her full name
and how to use the telephone. Make sure your child knows your completetelephone number including area code. If your child is old enough to remem-ber more than one number, teach your child your office, cellular, and/or other
numbers at which you can be reached. Tell your child you will accept acollect call. Show your child how to dial the operator and “911” for help.
Consider counseling.  Some abductors may take a child when they feel, rightly
or wrongly, their parental relationship with the child is threatened. Counsel-ing may help ease you through potentially threatening times such as theinitial separation, filing of a lawsuit for divorce or custody, issuance of finaldecrees, and start of a new romantic relationship.
Consider seeking assistance from Child Find
® of America. This nonprofit
organization serves missing children and their families, offers telephonecoun seling for parents who are considering abducting their own children,
mediation, support services, and referrals to other organizations. The media-tion program can be reached toll-free at 1-800-A-WAY-OUT (1-800-292-9688),and Child Find can be reached at 1-800-I-AM-LOST (1-800-426-5678)
and at www.childfind
®ofamerica.org.
Ask law enforcement or the prosecutor to intervene. Take abduction threats
seriously especially if the parent making them has recently quit a job, sold ahome, terminated a lease, closed a bank account, or taken any other action inpreparation for flight. Threats may indicate a growing frustration that couldmotivate that parent to disappear with your child. Ask law enforcement orthe prosecutor to contact the would-be abductor about the consequences ofthe abduction namely that taking a child is a crime and the offender could be
imprisoned, be fined, or both. If the potential abductor has threat ened
your child, another family member, or you, notify your local law-enforce-FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -ment agency or the prosecutor. You may also be able to get a protection order
under local law.
Notify schools, daycare centers, and babysitters of custody orders. Certi-
fied copies of your custody order should be placed in your child’s school files
and copies should be given to teachers, daycare personnel, and babysitters.If there is a risk of abduction by the noncustodial parent, inform all individu-als who care for your child of that risk and give them a photograph of thenoncustodial parent if you have one. Ask to be immediately alerted if the
noncustodial parent makes any unscheduled visits, and instruct them not to
allow your child to leave the property with the noncustodial parent without
your permission.
The best protection is to have a provision in your custody order prohibit-
ing unauthorized pick-up of your child by the noncustodial parent fromschools, daycare centers, and babysitters. Even without such a provision,though, a child should be released only to the parent entitled to custody. It isimportant to keep school authorities, daycare personnel, and babysitters awareof any changes in your custody or visitation arrangements. The custodial par-ent must also realize if the noncustodial parent is violent or threatening, school
and daycare officials as well as babysitters may have no alternative but to
release your child to that parent in order to prevent immediate injury to yourchild or other children in the area. Ask your child’s school and/or caretakersto immediately  notify law enforcement in the event of an abduction. A copy
of the custody order should be immediately given to law enforcementresponding to the call.
Custodial parents should notify school officials, daycare personnel, and
babysitters if their children are going to be absent and ask to be immediatelynotified if their children do not arrive on schedule. A few jurisdictions require
school officials to verify student absences, but custodial parents need to be
sure all people who normally care for their children know the situation andthe possibility of abduction. Time is critical in abduction cases. If a child is
abducted on the way to school, daycare, or the babysitter, it is extremelyimportant for the custodial parent to be immediately notified so a search forthe child and abductor can immediately begin.
Keep lists of information.  Make a list of the noncustodial parent’s
address, telephone numbers, SSN or citizen-identification numbers, passport
number(s), driver’s license number, credit-card numbers, bank-account num-bers, and date and place of birth. The same information should be gatheredfor relatives and friends who might help the abductor carry out an abduction.
File or register the custody decree where the noncustodial parent lives.
Follow procedures in the UCCJA or UCCJEA, whichever law is in effect in the
state where the noncustodial parent lives and child will be visiting. Filing orregistering puts the court on notice that a custody determination alreadyexists. A valid order is entitled to enforcement and cannot be modified exceptas specified in the PKPA and consistent state laws. More information aboutfiling and registration is found in the chapter titled “Recovering Your Child”beginning on page 93.
Treat child support and visitation as separate issues.  Child support and
visitation are legally separate issues. As a general rule the refusal to pay childsupport is not a legal ground for denying visitation, and denial of visitation is
21- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEnot a legal excuse to not pay child support. Additionally child abduction does
not relieve the duty to support.
Caveat:  It has been noted a parent may abduct a child as revenge because
the custodial parent sued for overdue child support. While it is not our inten-tion to discourage you from enforcing your right to collect overdue childsupport, it may be advisable to take extra precautions while doing so.
Flag passport applications. A parent who is concerned a child may be taken
to another country without his or her consent can request the child’s name beplaced in the U.S. Department of State’s Children’s Passport Issuance AlertProgram. To make use of this program a parent or attorney should providethe child’s full name, date and place of birth, telephone number, and a copyof the relevant custody orders to the Office of Children’s Issues, U.S.Depart ment of State, 2201 C Street, Northwest, SA-29, Washington, DC
20520-2818, 1-888-407-4747, 202-736-9090, fax 202-736-9132. This form isavailable at www.travel.state.gov. From the home page click on the “Children& Family” link. Under the “International Parental Child Abduction” headingclick on the “Guarding against & responding to parental child abduction”
link. Then respectively click on the “ A-Z Index of Topics” and “Form –Request Entry into the Children’s Passport Alert Program” links. A copy ofthis form is also found on page 269.
The requesting parent should be notified when a passport application
is received for his or her child. If the U.S. Department of State has a courtorder on file providing for joint or sole custody to the requesting par-
ent or re stricting the child’s travel, a passport should not be issued.
22FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Civil-Court Remedies
If Your Child Is Abducted
by Patricia M. Hoff
Chapter Overview
This chapter focuses on civil-court actions a parent can take to get a custodydetermination  that will be enforceable between jurisdictions and how to find an
attorney to help with that process. It also covers child-snatching lawsuits seek-
ing compen sation for the pain and suffering and out-of-pocket expenses caused
by an abduction.
The information in this chapter is important for married parents going through
a separation or divorce and unwed parents who may need a custody order toobtain help in the event of an abduction. There is also a section explaining the
rights and remedies of noncustodial parents in custody and visitation dis putes.
Parents in abusive relationships will find a section addressing domestic- violence
issues in the context of child abduction. Special issues in custody cases in volving
Native American chil dren and military dependents are also addressed. A sum-
mary of  civil-court remedies if your child is abducted by a family member  is
presented below. These remedies are more fully discussed in this chapter.
1. If you do not already have a custody determination, you should promptly
get one. Do not delay.
2. File for custody in a court with child-custody jurisdiction. Under the Uni-
form Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), in effect in
nearly all states, the child’s “home state” has priority to enter an initial cus-tody determination. The child’s “home state” is also the preferred place to filefor an original custody order under federal law. Courts in every jurisdictionare required to enforce “home state” custody orders.
3. If you already have a custody order and want to change it, the original issuing
court has exclusive jurisdiction to modify the order under the UCCJEA andfederal law if the respective statutory criteria are met. A court may haveexclusive jurisdiction to modify even if the child has moved and established anew home elsewhere.
4. Consider hiring a lawyer to help you. Try to find an attorney who is knowl-
edgeable about parental-kidnapping issues and whose services you canafford. Use the list of sources in this chapter to find a lawyer in your area.
5. You must give the abductor notice of your custody lawsuit. If you cannot give
actual notice, for example because the abductor has gone into hid ing, the
law allows you to publish notice. You may be required to seek court permis-sion before doing so. Inform the court of your unsuccessful efforts to giveactual notice.
FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -23Civil Remedies- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  6. You can file for custody on “home state” grounds even if your child is no
longer in that jurisdiction. Act promptly so as not to lose extended “home
state” status. The only time the child’s presence is required is when the courtexercises emergency jurisdiction.
  7. The court may issue a temporary custody order at first. This should be enough
for law enforcement to begin a criminal investigation and prosecutor to con-sider prosecution, if they have not already done so. It should also facilitateyour own search.
  8. Parents who are not married should consult a lawyer about getting a cus-
tody determination.
  9. If you are considering leaving the jurisdiction with your child because of
domestic violence or child abuse, consult a lawyer before you go  about get-
ting a temporary custody order and/or protection order. If you leave thestate for safety’s sake before getting a custody or protection order, file for
temporary custody on emergency grounds as soon as possible after arrivingin the new state. The UCCJEA, in effect in most states, expressly allows acourt to exercise emergency jurisdiction when the child, sibling, or parent isthreatened with mistreatment or abuse. Depending on state law, you mayhave to file for permanent custody in the child’s “home state,” the one youleft, but the “home state” court may decline jurisdiction in favor of your new
jurisdiction. You may wish to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline
®
for referral and information at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233) or visit
www.ndvh®.org.
10. Suing a parent in active military duty is possible, but you may encounter
delays in such proceedings based on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Actof 2003 (SCRA), which is formerly known as the Soldier’s and Sailor’sRelief Act of 1940 (SSCRA).
11. When a child is abducted to or from a Native American reservation, issues
arise about which jurisdiction’s laws apply. There are no simple answers.You will need the help of a lawyer familiar with the applicable tribal and
state laws.
12. Your child and/or you may have a cause of action against the abductor and
others who helped with the abduction if your jurisdiction’s law, including
statutes, common law, and case law, permits lawsuits based on an abduc-
tion. If such cases are allowed you may be able to recover money damages to
compensate for your actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in locating andrecovering your child and the emotional pain and suffering you endured.Lawsuits are not appropriate in every case. You may wish to consult an attor-ney to discuss the pros and cons of filing such action in your case.
13. Many of the same remedies available to custodial parents are also available to
noncustodial parents when a child is wrongfully taken or retained by thecustodial parent.
24 - F AMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSECivil RemediesFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Getting a Custody Determination
If you do not already have a custody determination, you need to get one as
promptly as possible from a court with jurisdiction over child custody. A well-drafted custody determination not only defines the rights and responsibilities ofboth parents with respect to their child, but often is critical to recovering a childafter an abduction. Custody issues are resolved by mutual agreement, which
may arise out of mediation or collaborative law negotiations, or by litigation.
You do not need a custody determination to report your child missing to local
law enforcement or have information about your child entered in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation’s National Crime Information Center’s Missing PersonFile (NCIC-MFP). These are steps you should promptly take regardless of whetherthere is a custody determination. See the chapter titled “Criminal Remedies in
Family-Abduction Cases” beginning on page 41.
Agreement of the Parties
Some parents work out custody and visitation matters on their own and file theiragreement with the court. Many jurisdictions provide forms for uncontested pro-ceedings so parents can handle the matter themselves. Both parties, however,may retain counsel either separately or together to review the agreement and/orfile it with the court. Once filed the court reviews the proposed agreement and
typically issues an order reflecting its terms.
Mediation
If parents cannot resolve custody issues by themselves, they may try voluntary
mediation or a court may refer the case for mediation. Mediation involves bothparties meeting with a professional, neutral mediator to reach agreement aboutchild-custody issues. The advantages of mediation are that parents can avoid alengthy and potentially expensive and acrimonious legal proceeding and parents
are usually willing to abide by the terms of a mediated agreement. Mediation,
however, is not for everyone. It may be unsuitable or ineffective in high-conflictfamilies where there is a history of actual or threatened abduction or domesticviolence. Some jurisdictions require custody mediation except in certain circum-stances such as those mentioned above. If a mediation agreement is reached bothparties may retain counsel either separately or together to review the agreementand/or file it with the court. The court reviews the agreement and typically issuesa custody determination with its terms.
Collaborative Law
“Collaborative law” is a relatively new option for parents seeking to resolve custodyissues without the uncertainty and expense of litigation. Though similar tomediation in that it seeks a mutually agreed solution, it differs because each partyis represented by his or her own lawyer. The novelty is that the parties and theirlawyers all commit to negotiating a mutually acceptable custody agreementwithout going to court. The parties have the benefit of legal advice and professionaladvocacy as they seek common ground. Their agreement would be reviewed
25- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEand made an order of the court. If custody is not resolved, the attorneys
must withdraw and the parties must then retain new lawyers to litigatecustody in court.
Litigation
Custody issues not resolved by mutual agreement are resolved by litigation.Litigation entails filing a lawsuit and having a hearing be fore a judge. In some
jurisdictions the hearing is referred to a special master who makes a recommen-dation that is then reviewed by a judge. The special master and/or judge will hearfrom both parties before deciding custody. The judge may also hear from a rep-
resentative of the child. Other witnesses, including experts, may also testify .Based on all of the information available to it, the court then makes a custodydetermination in the child’s best interests. Child custody litigation can be time-consuming and costly.
Do You Need a Lawyer?
Ordinarily an attorney presents a custody case to the court. A parent mayrepre sent him- or herself, but this can be difficult for numerous reasons. First
some laws are not easy to understand without legal training. The relationshipbetween federal laws and the laws of different jurisdictions, in particular withregard to child custody, is complicated. Second a parent may be too emotionally
involved to objectively approach the legal issue in the case such as what is in the
child’s best interests. Third many parents may be uncomfortable working withopposing counsel and judges. A parent’s nervousness and inexperience may hurtthe case.
For these reasons most people consult with and retain a lawyer. Your lawyer
can go to court on your behalf to obtain or modify a custody order and assist youin getting the order enforced and your child returned. Your lawyer can also helpyou evaluate whether to pursue criminal charges against an abductor and urgelaw enforcement and the prosecutor to investigate and prosecute if such action is
warranted. You may hire a second lawyer to help enforce your order in another
jurisdiction or country, or your attorney may associate with local counsel in theother jurisdiction or country to assist with enforcement proceedings. Your cus-tody lawyer or a different attorney who specializes in litigation may counselyou regarding child-snatching lawsuits and sue the abductor on your behalffor money damages.
What to Look For In a Lawyer
Ideally you want to find a knowledgeable lawyer whose services are afford-able. Use the list of resources in the section titled “Finding a KnowledgeableLawyer” beginning on page 27 to identify lawyers who have experience withfamily-abduction cases. If you cannot find a lawyer with expertise in handlingfamily-abduction cases, look for a family lawyer who has handled domestic
and/or inter national child-custody cases.
After you have identified one or more lawyers, call for an initial consultation.
There may be a small fee involved. Some lawyers will talk to you on the
26FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -27telephone, and others will set up an appointment for you at their office. Your
conversation will be confidential even if you choose not to hire the lawyer.
Describe your situation in detail and ask about the lawyer’s experience with
cases like yours. Inquire about the lawyer’s familiarity with the laws of a particu-
lar state or jurisdiction and federal laws and remedies that may apply to your
case such as the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), Uniform Child
Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Parental Kidnapping Pre-vention Act (PKPA), federal and state criminal-custodial interference laws, andchild-snatching lawsuits. If your child has been taken or kept in another country,ask about the lawyer’s familiarity with the Hague Convention on the CivilAspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention), and InternationalParental Kidnapping Crime Act (IPKCA).
Ask about the lawyer’s hourly rate and amount of retainer you must pay
before work begins. There may be court costs and filing fees to pay as well. You
should ask for an estimate of your total legal bill. Depending on your financial
circumstances, you may want to discuss flexible payment arrangements. Keep inmind you may be able to recover legal expenses from the abductor at the end ofthe proceeding. The UCCJA, UCCJEA, PKPA, and Hague Convention all haveprovisions addressing attorney fees. These are discussed in the chapter titled
“Recovering Your Child” beginning on page 93. If you are comfortable with
the lawyer, hire him or her. If not, interview another.

yer-referral services and free legal services throughout the country. You can
contact the ABA at 1-800-285-2221 or visit www.abanet.org. From that homepage, under the “Public Resources” heading, click on the “Find Legal Help”link, and then click on the link for the state in which you need a lawyer.
This is an excellent online resource. You may not have to look else-
where for links to lawyer-referral services for private attorneys, legal aid,

Local bar associations can also provide attorney-referral services. Con-
tact your local bar association and ask if they provide lawyer-referral services.
If so contact the lawyer-referral service for the names of several lawyers inyour area who have handled family-abduction cases or regularly handle child-custody cases. If you cannot identify an attorney through local information
sources, contact that state’s bar association, which is usually located in thecapital city, and ask for lawyer referrals as above. For an online directory of
bar associations visit www.abanet.org. From the home page click on the “Top-
ics A-Z” link. Then respectively click on the “Bar Associations (State andLocal) Information” and “Bar Directories” links.
The American Bar Association, Family Law Section  is another resource for
attorney referrals. Contact the Family Law Section of the ABA at 312-988-5145 and ask for the names and telephone numbers of the chairpersons of theChild Custody Committee and International Law Committee if you need helpwith an international-abduction case.

Free and Reduced-Fee Legal Services
If you cannot afford a private lawyer you may qualify for free or reduced-fee legalservices. Check with the organizations noted below about whether they can helpyou with your case or refer you to someone who can.
Legal aid. Look in the government pages of your area telephone directory
under “Legal Aid”  or “Legal Services Corporation” (LSC) for the number of
the closest legal-aid office or visit LSC’s website at www.lsc.gov. From thehome page click on the “Find Legal Assistance” link, which enables you toidentify the nearest legal-aid office. Call and ask if the office takes cases similarFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -to yours. Some legal-aid offices do not take family-law cases. If the office can
help you, make an appointment. If not, ask for a referral to the closest officethat can help you.
Legal aid for undocumented immigrants who are domestic-violence
victims. Federal law enacted in January 20066 expanded the services that
LSC- funded programs can provide to indigent, undocumented aliens who
are victims of domestic violence or whose children have been victimized. Spe-
cifically LSC-funded programs now may provide legal assistance to help anundocumented immigrant or child escape from domestic violence, sexual
assault, trafficking, or “Section U”
7 crimes or to protect against future domes-
tic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, or “Section U” criminal activity.
The law allows LSC to provide “related legal assistance” to eligible aliens
who are victims of domestic abuse even if they are not married to or the child
of their abusers. Previously the law only allowed such assistance when the
domestic abuse was perpetrated by the spouse or parent of the victim. In
another change LSC-funded programs may assist the abused spouse or childto seek suspension of deportation or self-petition for immigrant status,thus avoiding the necessity of relying on the citizen/legal permanent resi-dent abusive s pouse or parent’s willingness to file or pursue the petition on
his or her behalf.
LSC-funded, legal-aid offices are nonprofit, nongovernmental organiza-
tions not affiliated in any way with immigration authorities. LSC-fundedprograms are not required to maintain records regarding the immigration
status of their clients who are victims of domestic violence. Attorney-client
communications are confidential, so undocumented immigrant domestic-violence victims should not hesitate to consult with a licensed legal-aidimmigration attorney. Decisions to provide representation are made on a case-by-case basis. Most legal-aid offices maintain lists of alternate legal resourcesif the victim turns out not to be qualified for legal-aid services.
For additional domestic-violence-victim legal resources contact one of the
attorneys in NCMEC’s Missing Children Division at 1-888-24-NCMEC(1-888-246-2632).
Local bar associations.  If you do not qualify for free legal services but do not
have enough money to hire a private lawyer, you may be eligible for specialreduced-fee programs set up by local, bar-association groups. In addition to
reduced-fee programs, many bar associations encourage attor neys to com-

Filing for Custody
“Filing for custody” involves filing legal papers, generally called pleadings , in
which you ask the court to grant the requested relief such as an initial custody
order, a change of custody or visitation, or prevention provisions. A custody actionshould be filed in a court that has jurisdiction  to make a valid custody determina-
tion. An enforcement action is typically filed wherever the child is located.
Jurisdiction
Three statutes affect a court’s jurisdiction to make or modify a custody order andrequire courts to enforce orders issued by another court. They are the Paren-tal Kid napping Prevention Act (PKPA), Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act
(UCCJA), and Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act(UCCJEA). These statutes are summarized below and apply to proceedings in
states and territories.
The PKPA is a federal law that impacts the exercise of child-custody jurisdic-
tion by courts throughout the nation. The UCCJA and UCCJEA are state statues.
The UCCJA was drafted in 1968. The UCCJEA was drafted in 1997 as a replace-ment for the UCCJA. As of November 2008, 46 states, the District of Columbia,Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted the UCCJEA. The remaining
states follow the UCCJA, though it is likely most if not all of them will enact theUCCJEA in the near future. Consult the section titled “Nationwide Directory ofFamily-Abduction Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199 for citations to the
laws in effect in your state and the state where enforcement is sought.
Caveat: Even though the UCCJA and UCCJEA are both “uniform” statues,
jurisdictions tend to change the language when they adopt them. Consequently it
is essential to read the version of the act in effect in your state and the state wherethe enforcement is sought.
Parents of abducted children need to be aware of these laws and should bring
them to the attention of their lawyers. In turn lawyers should be prepared tofamiliarize judges with relevant sections of the UCCJA or UCCJEA and PKPA aswell as the federal Violence Against Women Act in cases involving domestic violence.
To make a valid custody determination a court must have jurisdiction over
custody matters under either the UCCJA or UCCJEA, and notice and opportu-nity to be heard must be given to the parties. The court’s exercise of jurisdictionmust also comply with the PKPA in order for its custody determination to beeligible for “full faith and credit” or enforcement nationwide as a matter of
federal law.
The PKPA requires courts to enforce and not modify sister state custody and
visitation determinations if the court making the order exercised jurisdiction con-
sistent with federal criteria. Under the PKPA, “home state” is the preferred basis- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 32for making an initial custody determination. For cases in which a change in cus-
tody is sought, the PKPA grants exclusive continuing jurisdiction to the originaldecree state if the original exercise of jurisdiction complied with the PKPA, acontestant or the child continues to live in the “home state,” and state lawprovides a basis for custody jurisdiction. The PKPA also prohibits a court from
exercising jurisdiction when another court is already exercising jurisdiction con-
sistently with its terms.
The UCCJA or UCCJEA, whichever is in effect, regulates which state has
jurisdiction to make or modify a custody or visita tion order and requires sister
states to enforce and not modify custody and visitation orders made by otherstates and, in most cases, other countries.
The UCCJA is not entirely consistent with the PKPA, and, as a result, some
custody orders made under the UCCJA are not entitled to “full faith and credit”in other states under the PKPA. In case of a conflict the federal law preempts or
takes precedence over inconsistent state law. The UCCJEA was written to remove
inconsistencies with the PKPA so custody and visitation orders made under statelaw would be entitled to “full faith and credit” as a matter of federal law. TheUCCJEA also provides expedited procedures for interjurisdictional enforcementof custody and visitation.
File In the Child’s “Home State”
As a general rule, in order to get an initial custody determination entitled tonationwide enforcement, you must file for custody in the child’s home state .
That is the location where the child lived for at least six months just before thecustody action. The child need not be physically present for the court to exercise
home state jurisdiction. The only time the child’s presence is required to make
a custody determination is when a court exercises emergency jurisdiction. Home
state jurisdiction is the preferred basis for initial jurisdiction under the UCCJEAand PKPA. Although the UCCJA treats home state jurisdiction and significant-connection jurisdiction as co-equals, it is better to seek an initial custodydeter mination in the child’s home state because the resulting custody order
must be granted “full faith and credit” in sister states.
Both the UCCJA and UCCJEA extend home state jurisdiction if a child is
abducted or otherwise absent from the state. The left-behind parent has six monthsfrom the time the child is gone to file for custody in the home state. Duringthis time the abductor cannot establish a new “home state” for the child, andany custody order obtained in the home state is enforceable wherever thechild is found.
What If There Is an Emergency?
Both the UCCJA and UCCJEA recognize emergencies require prompt judicialaction. In both statutes the child must be present in the jurisdiction for a court toexercise emergency jurisdiction. The grounds for exercising emergency custodyjurisdiction are narrow because emergency jurisdiction is meant to be reservedfor ex traordinary cases. The UCCJEA expressly allows a court to exercise emer-
gency custody jurisdiction when a parent flees on account of domestic violence.Additional details about this are found in the section titled “Getting Custody inFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 33Special Circumstances” beginning on page 34. Courts are supposed to enter
temporary orders in emergency cases, so the court that would ordinarily havejurisdiction can address the underlying custody and visitation issues. TheUCCJEA makes it possible for a temporary emergency order to become per-manent in certain circumstances. Notice must be given in emergency cases
for the court to enter a custody determination that is entitled to enforcement
in other states or territories.
Notice to the Abductor
All parties to a lawsuit are entitled to “notice and opportunity to be heard” as amatter of due process. In child-custody and family-abduction cases to which theUCCJA or UCCJEA and PKPA apply, parties, including abductors, must be givennotice of court proceedings and an opportunity to present their side of the case.
The person filing the lawsuit, the plaintiff, has a legal obligation to give notice
and opportunity to be heard to the person being sued, the defendant. The defen-dant is not legally obligated to participate in the proceeding. As long as a party hasbeen given notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court can enter a bindingorder on the party.
Notice must be given in a manner “reasonably calculated to give actual
notice.” The UCCJA and UCCJEA contain special notice provisions that may beparticularly helpful when  the abductor’s location is unknown . Both statutes
recognize actual notice may not be possible, particularly if a case involvesparental kidnapping or other efforts by one party to deliberately hide from
another or thwart service of process, and allow notice by publication if other
means are not effective. It is advisable, and in some states required, to ask the
court for permission to use publication as a means of service when other meth-ods have failed. Support your request for notice by publication by documentingall efforts you have made to give actual notice.
Caveat: If you are advised you cannot file for custody after the abductor and
child have disappeared because it is impossible to give notice, ask your lawyer toreview the Jurisdiction  and Notice provisions of your state’s law, which is either the
UCCJA or UCCJEA.
While it is possible to obtain a custody order after an abduction it may not
be possible to charge the abductor with a crime if the criminal law of the staterequires a “knowing violation of a court order” as an element of the offense.Under such statutes there must  be proof the abductor actually  knew of the
court order he or she is accused of violating. It may, however, still be possible forlaw enforcement to locate and obtain the return of the child.
Service of Civil Process
In some jurisdictions local law-enforcement agencies may serve civil process , the
legal paperwork telling a person he or she is a party to a lawsuit such as a courtaction to obtain or enforce a custody determination. The agency notifies theabducting parent a custody action has been filed by delivering a copy of the legaldocuments to that parent. Frequently the sheriff’s office or county police depart-ment serves civil process. Usually you have to inform these agencies where tofind the person they will serve. The agency serving civil process will be the oneserving the area where the abductor is located.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 34In the event the local law-enforcement agency in the abductor’s locale does
not or cannot serve the abductor with civil process, it is possible to use the ser-
vices of a private process server. Your lawyer can advise you whether to use thelocal law-enforcement agency or a private process server to serve the abductor.
Temporary Custody Orders
After filing for custody you may initially obtain a temporary cus tody order.
Judges usually make temporary custody orders before they have had the benefit
of hearing from both parents or the case is fully investigated. Temporaryorders are commonly made in the early stages of parental-kidnapping cases whenthe court is unable to hear from both parents because one parent has abducted
the child and is in hiding. Temporary custody orders are the appropriate relief
when courts exercise emergency jurisdiction. As long as notice and opportunity
to be heard are given, temporary orders are en forceable in other states.
After a full hearing, the court enters its order. These are sometimes referred to
as “permanent” or “final” orders despite the fact custody orders are always sub-ject to change or modification. The PKPA, UCCJA, and UCCJEA set forth rulesgoverning modification jurisdiction and other laws set forth substantive groundsfor modifying custody.
You do not need a custody order for law-enforcement authorities to take a
missing-person report and enter information about your child in the FederalBureau of Investigation’s National Crime Information Center database. Nor doyou need a custody order for some state criminal laws and the InternationalParental Kidnapping Crime Act to apply. Still, obtaining a custody order, even atemporary custody order, can help with your search and recovery efforts.
Getting Custody in Special Circumstances
Pre-Decree Abductions
In pre-decree abduction cases, both the UCCJA and UCCJEA allow left-behindparents to file for custody in the child’s “home state” even after the child has beenabducted and do not require the child to be physically present for a court toexercise jurisdiction. Notice by publication is authorized for situations wherepersonal service is ineffective such as when an abductor evades process by con-cealing his or her whereabouts. This was discussed earlier in the section titled“Notice to the Abductor” on page 33.
Domestic Violence and Child Abuse
If you are a victim of domestic violence, or your child is the victim of abuse, youare strongly advised to consult an attorney before leaving the jurisdiction . Time
permitting, you should be able to get a temporary custody order. Temporarycustody orders entered in accordance with UCCJA or UCCJEA and PKPA areentitled to enforcement by other states.
Victims of domestic violence can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline
toll-free at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233) or visit www.ndvh.org forinfor mation about crisis intervention and referrals to shelters, legal services, and
counseling. Legal technical assistance in interstate, child-custody/domestic-FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 35violence cases is available from the Legal Resource Center on Violence Against
Women at www.lrcvaw.org or 301-270-1550. Undocumented immigrants whoare victims of domestic violence may also be eligible for legal aid. To learn moreabout this option see the section titled “Free and Reduced-Fee Legal Services”
beginning on page 28.
In urgent situations you should be able to obtain a protection order under
local law. Protection orders may include temporary custody provisions. Protec-tion orders are enforceable interstate under the federal Violence Against WomenAct. Custody and visitation provisions contained in protection orders may or maynot be enforceable in sister states. The enforceability of such provisions may
depend on whether the UCCJA or UCCJEA, including their notice requirements,
was followed.
When seeking a protection order and/or custody order, the victim parent
should ask the court to prevent the disclosure of their contact information to the
alleged abuser.
Getting a custody order before leaving the jurisdiction has two benefits. First
the victim parent can ask a judge to include a specific visitation schedule and
other protective provisions in the custody order including pick-up and drop-offpoints or supervised and limited visitation. Second a valid custody order shouldprotect the victim parent from later being accused of, or prosecuted for, custo-dial interference. The laws of some jurisdictions give domestic-violence victims arebuttable affirmative defense to the crimes of parental kidnapping, criminalcustodial interference, and interference with visitation if they promptly notify
criminal-justice authorities of the reason for their flight and seek custody within
a specified period of time. Parents should discuss the consequences of failing tofile for custody before departing the state.
If it is too dangerous to remain in the jurisdiction, the parent should promptly
consult an attorney upon arrival in the new jurisdiction. If that jurisdiction hasenacted the UCCJEA, the parent can petition for custody on emergency grounds.The order may become permanent if no action is brought in the child’s homestate and the order so provides. If a custody action is filed or pending in the homestate, the victim parent must respond to that suit. In some circumstances it may
be possible to do so without actually returning to the state, such as by appearing
through an attorney or telephonically. The parent may ask the court for custodyor, in the alternative, to decline jurisdiction in favor of the new state.
The UCCJA does not expressly provide for emergency jurisdiction based on
domestic violence as the UCCJEA does; however, courts in UCCJA jurisdictionsmay interpret the statute broadly and issue temporary orders to protect thechild’s safety. The victim parent must then file for custody in the child’s homestate. The parent can simultaneously request the “home state” court to decline
jurisdiction on inconvenient forum grounds in favor of the new state.
Unmarried Parents
In some jurisdictions the mother of a child born out of wedlock has custody ofthe child unless there is a contrary custody order. Even though an unmarriedmother living in such a jurisdiction may be able to recover an abducted childwithout obtaining a custody order, it is still a good idea to go to court and obtaina custody order prior to any problems arising. This will expand the number of- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSElegal remedies available to secure the child’s return and lessen the confusion if
the child is found in a jurisdiction where officials are unfamiliar with such cus-tody laws. It will also provide a definite plan for the child’s custody once the childis returned.
An unmarried mother living in a jurisdiction without such automatic rights
of custody is usually in the same position as other parents without custodyorders. Her custody rights are no greater than the father’s custody rights. The factthe father is not named on the child’s birth certificate may not provide the motherwith adequate legal protection in the event the father takes the child. Paternitypresumption laws that presume a man is the father may apply if he and/or themother and child acted as if he were the parent.
An unmarried father who wishes to obtain custody must first establish legally
that he is the father of the child. He may do this by filing a paternity action. Beingnamed on the birth certificate may help prove he is the father. Paternity pre-
sumptions based on his actions toward the child and the actions of the mother
and child toward him may also help prove he is the father if the laws in thatjurisdiction recognize such presumptions. In jurisdictions where no presump-tions are used, he may need to use blood or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testingto prove he is the father. Once paternity is established the father can ask the courtto award him custody, just as a father in any divorce proceeding may do. Unmar-ried parents should consult with a lawyer when seeking a custody order.
When a Parent Is In the Military
The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act8 (SCRA), formerly known as the Soldier’s
and Sailor’s Civil Relief Act of 1940, offers protections to servicemembers fromcertain civil judicial and administrative proceedings when the servicemember’scurrent military duty materially affects his or her ability to appear. SCRA does notapply to criminal proceedings.
Protections under SCRA include stays of proceedings for a minimum of
90 days when the servicemember files a written request meeting statutoryrequirements; stays of execution of judgments; and relief from default judg-ments, which are court decisions made when a defendant does not make anappearance in the case.
SCRA does not bar a parent from filing for custody even if the other parent is
in the military. A parent, however, should anticipate possible delays in the pro-ceeding upon the servicemember’s request to the court. A parent should alsoinform the court by affidavit that the defendant is a servicemember if he or shedoes not appear in court. Your lawyer should review SCRA to become familiarwith the changes in the law.
Other issues arise in enforcement cases when the parent in the military is
stationed in another country. See the chapter titled “International Child Abduc-
tion” beginning on page 105 for information about this situation.

Pub. L. No. 108-189, Sec. 1, Dec. 19, 2003, 117 Stat. 2835.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 37Native American Children
When Native American children are subjects of custody proceedings involving
foster care, termination of parental rights, pre-adoptive placements, andadop tion, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is the governing law. Intrafamily
custody disputes, such as those arising in the context of divorce, do not fall underICWA and other laws as noted below may apply.
The custody of Native American children living on a reservation will usually
be decided under tribal law. Although more than one tribe may live on a singlereservation, each reservation usually has one set of tribal laws. The laws of differ-ent reservations vary. Even if both parents are members of the same tribe, thelaws of their individual reservation may vary. If a Native American child living ona reservation is the subject of a custody dispute between parents who are mem-bers of different tribes, the tribe with jurisdiction may be the one in which thechild is enrolled . Frequently the governing body of the reservation where the
child lives may decide the case. These disputes are between tribes and
governed by tribal law. Children living on a reservation whose parents are of
different backgrounds – one Native American and one non-Native American –
may be considered by the tribe and law to be Native American children, andcustody of these children may be governed by the tribe or reservation of theNative American parent.
Information about a particular tribe’s custody laws may be available from
the tribe or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at 202-208-3710 or www.doi.gov/bia.Information may also be available from the National Congress of AmericanIndians at 202-466-7767 or www.ncai.org. From the home page click on the
“Tribal Directory” link.
When Native American children do not live on a reservation, state law will
usually apply to settle custody disputes arising in connection with divorce pro-
ceedings. Legal complications occur when a child moves, or is moved on and off
a reservation, typically because one parent is Native Ameri can and the other is
not. Tribal-state jurisdictional issues are apt to arise when a child living on the
reservation is ab ducted from the reservation, and, conversely, when a child liv-
ing off the reservation is abducted to a reservation. Does the tribal or state courthave jurisdiction to decide custody? Are tribal courts required to enforce state
court custody or ders or defer to the other state court’s custody proceedings? Are
state courts bound to enforce tribal custody orders or defer to the tribal court?
These are complex legal questions needing careful attention from lawyers with
special knowledge of tribal law and state family law.
While a few states addressed the question of state court cus tody jurisdic-
tion over Native American children in their UCCJA statutes, most did not. Nordoes the PKPA expressly apply to child-custody-jurisdiction dis putes between
tribes and states. Courts interpreting the statutes are divided on whether thesestatutes apply to jurisdictional disputes between state and tribal courts concernedwith custody of the same child.
States that en act the UCCJEA may adopt provisions requiring their courts to
treat tribes as if they are states, treating tribal-court custody proceedings as if theyare sister state court proceedings, and enforcing tribal custody orders. Checkthe UCCJEA in your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction in which your child is- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 38located to determine whether the law includes a section titled “ Application to
Indian Tribes.”
State criminal-custodial interference statutes and missing-children laws may
apply to cases involving Native American children abducted to or from a reserva-
tion if any prohibited act occurs outside the boundaries of the reservation. In
addition these criminal statutes may apply if the reservation has accepted a state’s
criminal laws.
Child-Snatching Lawsuits
In addition to going to court for a custody determination, child-snatchinglawsuits may provide another avenue of relief for parents of abducted children.Left-behind parents may file these lawsuits, on their own and/or on behalf of thechild, against the abductor and others who assist the abductor, such as grandpar-ents, siblings, friends, and businesses, for tortious or wrongful conduct.
The lawsuits seek money damages from the abducting parent and his or
her associates to compensate for the expenses, pain, and suffering resultingfrom the abduction.
Child-snatching lawsuits have been based on claims for unlawful imprison-
ment, interference with custody or visitation, enticement, intentional inflictionof emotional distress, outrageous conduct, and civil conspiracy. These lawsuitshave been successfully brought in both state and federal courts. A few jurisdic-tions have enacted laws expressly allowing lawsuits of this kind. Courts in anumber of jurisdictions have allowed child-snatching lawsuits based on com-
mon law. Courts in a few jurisdictions have declined to recognize a new cause of
action in child-snatching cases, leaving victims to seek relief in other ways.
The section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws
and Resources,” beginning on page 199,  lists child-snatching lawsuits for
each jurisdiction.
Your family lawyer may be able to file a child-snatching lawsuit for you, or
you can consult an attorney whose practice focuses on personal-injury matters.After the lawsuit is filed there is a period for “discovery.” This fact-finding processmay reveal important information about an abducted child’s location.
Caveat: Child-snatching lawsuits are not advisable in every case. You may be
too financially or emotionally exhausted to become involved in another lawsuit.You may be unable to collect a judgment in your favor if the defendant is judg-ment proof or unable to pay.
Child-snatching lawsuits, however, are not the only way to recover some or
all of your costs such as fees for attorneys, private investigators, and counseling.The UCCJA, UCCJEA, PKPA, Hague Convention, and ICARA all include cost-
recovery provisions for prevailing parties. In addition crime-victim-assistance laws
in many jurisdictions allow the court to order the abductor and/or others whoassisted the abductor to repay the searching parent for some or all costs incurredin the location, recovery, and post-recovery treatment of a child.

Custodial Parents Disappear With a Child
When a custodial parent goes into hiding with a child, a noncustodial parent hasmany of the same rights and remedies as a custodial parent to locate the child andenforce visitation rights.
Noncustodial parents may initiate a missing-person investigation and
request entry of information about the child into NCIC. These steps are dis-
cussed in the chapter titled “Criminal Remedies in Family-Abduction Cases”beginning on page 41.
A noncustodial parent may file an action asking a court to modify the original
custody determination and award him or her custody. A modification action nor-mally would be filed in the jurisdiction where the original order was made. ThePKPA grants exclusive continuing modification jurisdiction to the origi-nal de cree court if a parent or child continues to live there and the law of the
original state provides any basis for jurisdiction.
Modification is by no means automatic. In fact persuading the court to change
custody is usually difficult and costly. The standards for modifying custody andvisitation orders vary and are set forth in the local law of the state or territory.Typically evidence is required of a major and significant change in circumstancesmaking it in the child’s best interest to change custody. Abduction of the childmay not be enough justification to change custody. If the evidence warrants achange of custody, in most states even an award of temporary  custody by the
court will allow you to use all the resources listed in this guide, including thoseoffered by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, to help findyour child.
A noncustodial parent may be able to sue and collect money damages from
the custodial parent for violating visitation rights. There is some case-law sup-port for this. Lawsuits for interference with visitation rights may discourageobstruction of visitation and compensate the noncustodial parent for the costsincurred in enforcing visitation rights. Such lawsuits  were discussed in the sec-
tion titled “Child-Snatching Lawsuits” on page 38.
If state law permits, missing-child clearinghouses may also provide services to
noncustodial parents seeking to enforce their visitation rights. Contact informa-tion regarding the clearinghouse in your state is available in the section titled
“Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws and Resources,” beginning
on page 199. Some missing-children organizations and various advo cacy
groups may also be able to assist.
The Federal Parent Locator Service ( FPLS) may be used by authorized per-
sons to locate custodial as well as noncustodial parents. Unless restricted bycourt order, noncustodial parents have the same rights as custodial parentsunder the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) to school records.The FPLS and FERPA are discussed in the chapter titled “Searching for Your Child”
beginning on page 63.
All books and brochures published by NCMEC are available to noncustodial
parents. Many of the resources listed in the section titled “Bibliography,” begin-ning on page 143, may be helpful to a noncustodial parent in the event acusto dial parent disappears with the child. A noncustodial parent should be pre-- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 40pared to be an active participant  in the search. It may be necessary, in some
instances, to obtain court orders for the disclosure of the information.
Notwithstanding the remedies listed above, noncustodial parents may find
they face more difficulties than custodial parents do in locating and recovering
their children. Gaps and inconsistencies in the laws and law-enforcement poli-
cies may frustrate even the most patient noncustodial parents. You may find it
helpful to join with other victimized parents to advocate for changes in the lawsand local law-enforcement policies. Missing-child clearinghouses and victim-
advocacy organizations may also be helpful.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Criminal Remedies in
Family-Abduction Cases
by Patricia M. Hoff
Chapter Overview
This chapter describes how the criminal-justice system responds to family-abduction cases. It provides an overview of laws aimed at finding missingchildren and bringing abductors to justice. It explains what parents shouldexpect from law en forcement and prosecutors at all levels and how to request
their intervention.
Parents  should simultaneously pursue all appropriate remedies including both
civil remedies and assistance from law enforcement. Below is a summary of the
ways you can involve law enforcement and prosecutors  as more fully dis-
cussed in this chapter.
1. Immediately report your missing child to local law enforcement.2. Request law enforcement to enter information about your child into the
Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Crime Information Center-
Miss ing Person File (NCIC-MPF) without delay. Law enforcement is required
to enter every missing-child case into NCIC within two hours of receiving thereport. If the abduction is in progress, talk to law enforcement about possiblyissuing an America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert
or using other means to enlist the public’s help in locating your child. Typi-
cally AMBER Alerts only apply to children who have been abducted
and are facing grave danger. More information about this system isavailable at www.amberalert.gov.
3. If you have trouble getting law enforcement to take a missing-person report
or enter information about your child into NCIC, contact your missing-child clearinghouse or the National Center for Missing & Ex ploited

10. To avoid confusion caused by conflicting custody orders, promptly file or
register your custody order in a court in the jurisdiction where the abductor islocated. The legal authority is found in either the Uni form Child Custody
Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) or Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforce-ment Act (UCCJEA).

prevent a reabduction.
12. Contact crime-victim programs to find out if you are eligible for assistance.Criminal Remedies FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -43Left-Behind Parent’s Role
While pursuing whatever criminal remedies are appropriate to the situation, a
left-behind parent should actively pursue all appropriate civil remedies to locateand recover his or her child and prevent a reabduction.
If your child is missing, or the abductor is criminally charged, press
for an active investigation by law enforcement. Cooperate with law-enforce ment
investigators, and try to develop leads on your own even as law enforce-ment is investigating.
Although law enforcement may be able to initiate an investigation and even
locate your child, the court or recovering agency may not release a child to theleft-behind parent if the custody issue has not been resolved in civil court. Youmust work through the civil courts to secure and enforce your custody rights.Promptly take steps to get a custody determination if you do not already haveone. If you have an order, you should be prepared to file an enforcement actiononce your child is found. Do not rely on the criminal process to vindicate your
custody rights. The prosecutor is not your private lawyer. He or she represents
the public interest in having criminal laws enforced. Even if the prosecutorbecomes involved in the civil aspects of a child-custody enforcement actionunder the UCCJEA, this is done on behalf of the court. Your own lawyer repre-sents your personal interest in having your child returned and can go to familycourt on your behalf to try to accomplish this.
You may also find it necessary to go back to court to modify the original
custody order. You may ask the court to change custody, restrict the abductor’svisitation rights, or order other prevention measures to safeguard against a
reabduction. These steps are necessary even if a criminal court’s sentence for
parental kidnapping temporarily alters an abductor’s exercise of custody or visi-tation rights through conditions of probation, incarceration, or parole. Theabductor’s rights and responsibilities toward the child continue to be defined bythe existing custody determination unless and until it is modified by a civil courtwith custody jurisdiction.
Law Enforcement and Prosecutors’ Rolesin Family-Abduction Cases
Every left-behind parent should understand how law-enforcement authori-ties and prosecutors can help in locating and recovering an abducted childand bringing the abductor to justice. T his chapter describes the criminal-
justice-system response to family-abduction cases.
Local  law enforcement, such as your local police department or sheriff’s
office, and prosecutors, such as district attorneys, state’s attorneys, and
prosecuting attor neys, serve various functions in family-abduction cases. Law-
enforcement officers take reports of missing children and are required by federallaw to enter them in NCIC within two hours of report receipt and investigatethese cases. They may provide assistance in serving the le gal paperwork or
civil process necessary before the courts will make or enforce your custody order.Prosecutors may prosecute the abductor depending on the circumstances of theabduction and scope of the criminal laws in effect in your jurisdiction. In appro-- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 44TROUBLE

Program Management.  Alexandria, Virginia: National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, 2006, page 84.priate cases they may request federal investigative assistance pursuant to the fed-
eral Fugitive Felon Act.
In addition to traditional criminal-justice-system functions, law enforcement
and prosecutors in many states also have civil statutory authority pursuant to theUCCJEA to locate and recover children and enforce custody determinations. This
public-enforcement role is described in the chapter titled “Searching for Your
Child” beginning on page 63.
Federal  prosecutors, such as U.S. Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys,
and the FBI respond to parental-kidnapping cases pursuant to federal law. U.S.Attorneys may prosecute international-abduction cases pursuant to IPKCA. Inaddition they may charge a fugitive with violating the Fugitive Felon Act, pursu-ant to which an Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP) warrant may beissued for the fugitive’s arrest. The FBI investigates abductions between states/territories and international-abduction cases pursuant to the Fugitive Felon Act.
The FBI also investigates international-abduction cases in connection with alleged
IPKCA violations. The FBI maintains NCIC, a computerized database that is animportant tool in locating abducted children and their abductors. The FBI isauthorized by federal law to confirm entries of missing children into NCIC andmake those entries in valid cases when local law enforcement does not do so.
What If a Criminal-Justice ProfessionalWon’t Get Involved?
There may be a gap between what the law allows and help you actually get fromlaw enforcement and prosecutors. One possible explanation is prosecutors havediscretion to decide whether and how to pursue possible criminal-law violations.Likewise the civil authority under the UCCJEA is also discretionary. Anotherpossible explanation is some criminal-justice-system professionals believe family-
abduction cases are private matters best left to the family court to resolve.
In response to laws enacted in recent years to combat parental kidnapping
and find missing children and because of a heightened public awareness ofthe need to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction, manycriminal-justice personnel have embraced a more responsive approach tofamily-abduction cases.
If you encounter law enforcement and prosecutors who are reluctant to inter-
vene in your family-abduction case, it may help to show them the passages below.
We also now recognize children are deeply and permanentlyaffected by family abduction. The emotional scarring caused bythese events requires officers to recognize fam ily abduction not as
a harmless offense where two parents...are arguing over who
‘loves the child more,’ but instead as an insidi ous form of
child abuse. The history of the issue has also demonstrated lawenforcement has a much broader responsibility than the simpleact of ‘retrieval.’ By responding promptly, professionally, and effi-ciently to reports of family abduction, officers and the agenciesthey represent become, in effect, a means of protection for the child.

Missing-Person Investigation
Report Your Missing Child to Local Law Enforcement
Because the first few hours of an investigation are critical, you must act quicklywhen you discover your child is missing. After checking with friends and rela-tives to help ensure the other parent is not legitimately delayed in returning yourchild, immediately contact law enforcement to file a missing-person report. Usethe “Missing-Person Report for an Abducted Child”  form on page 261 to orga-
nize the information you will need to give law enforcement.
If you believe your child is being removed from the United States to
another country also notify the closest FBI field office without delay. Askto speak with the Crimes Against Children (CAC) Coordinator. A list ofFBI field offices is available at www.fbi.gov. From the home page click onthe “Your Local FBI Office” link, or check your local telephone directoryfor the closest FBI office.
Ask Law Enforcement to Enter Your Child’s Description In NCIC
When asking law enforcement to enter information about your child into NCICbe sure to specify the nationwide National Crime Information Center database, aslaw-enforcement agencies may mistake area “Be-on-the-Lookout” bulletins, alsoknown as BOLOs, or teletypes, for NCIC. The NCIC entry is critical because infor-mation placed in a state system alone cannot be accessed nationwide.
Federal law, the National Child Search Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5779-5780,
as amended by the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploita-tion of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003 and Adam Walsh ChildProtection and Safety Act of 2006 (Adam Walsh Act) requires every federal, state,and local law-enforcement agency to report each case of a missing child younger
than the age of 21  to NCIC. The law prohibits any waiting period  before
accepting a missing-child report and requires entry  of missing-child re ports
within two hours of receipt  into both the state law-enforcement system
and NCIC.
The two-hour entry mandate was added by the Adam Walsh Act. It ap plies to
all jurisdictions regardless of whether the local laws note “im mediate” or “prompt”
entry or allow longer waiting periods. Relevant sections of these federal lawsare reprinted beginning on page 155. Child-abduction cases should be en tered
into NCIC in either the endangered or involuntary category, and the ChildAbduction (“CA”) flag should be entered in the NCIC record. If an AMBERAlert is issued the AMBER Alert (AA) flag should be entered in the NCICrecord. See information about this program on page 46.
You do not need a custody determination to report a child missing or for the
child’s name to be entered into NCIC. If you have a custody order, however, bring
10Id., page 106.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 46it with you when you report your child missing. Information about your missing
child must be entered in NCIC even if the abductor is not charged with a crime.
NCIC is a computerized database of documented criminal-justice informa-
tion maintained by the FBI to help criminal-justice agencies at all governmentallevels perform their duties including apprehending fugitives and locating miss-
ing persons. Criminal-justice agencies enter records into NCIC, which in turn
are accessible to law-enforcement agencies nationwide. NCIC stores vast amountsof criminal-justice information that is instantly retrievable through an NCIC ter-minal to any authorized agency 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Data is stored in18 different files, including the Missing Person File, Vehicle File, License PlateFile, Wanted Person File, and Protection Order File.
In family-abduction cases, criminal-justice agencies throughout the nation can
use the NCIC database to help apprehend an abductor and locate an abductedchild. The missing-person section of the computer database is primarily designed
to provide law-enforcement officers with easy access to basic information about
people whose whereabouts are unknown. Official agencies around the countrymay also use the NCIC to verify case information for other purposes. Informationabout the abductor may also be entered in various NCIC files. Depending on thecase, abductor entries may be made in the Wanted Person File; Vehicle File;License File; and, in some jurisdictions, the Missing Person File. All NCIC entriespertaining to the child and abductor should be cross-referenced. In that way thechild may be detected if an NCIC check is run on the abductor, for instanceduring a routine traffic stop.
America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert
If an abduction is in progress, talk to law enforcement about possibly issuing anAMBER Alert. An AMBER Alert causes an urgent news bulletin to be broadcastover the airwaves as well as on highway signs to enlist the public’s help in findingan abducted child and stopping the abductor. AMBER Alerts are not issued inevery case. The circumstances surrounding the child’s disappearance must meet
the local AMBER Alert criteria. Even if a case does not meet criteria for issuing an
AMBER Alert, other investigative tools will be employed, and in some instancesmedia may be called upon to help publicize the case.
The U.S. Department of Justice recommends the criteria noted below for
AMBER Alert programs nationwide.
Law-enforcement officials must have reason to believe an abduction
of a child age 17 or younger has occurred.
Law-enforcement officials must believe the abducted child is in immi-nent danger of serious bodily injury or death.
Sufficient descriptive information must exist about both the victimand abductor for an AMBER Alert to assist in the recovery of the child.
The child’s name and other critical data, including the Child Abduc-tion flag must be entered into NCIC.
More information about the AMBER Alert program is available at
www.amberalert.gov.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -What if Local Law Enforcement Does Not Take A Missing-Person
Report or Make the NCIC Entry?
Authorities have the primary responsibility for taking missing-person reports and
entering information into NCIC. If local law enforcement fails to enter a valid caseinto NCIC, parents should seek assistance from their missing-child clearinghouseand/or NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST

information is found in the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduc-tion Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199. Clearinghouse personnelcan con tact local law enforcement about the case. NCMEC can also confirm, but
cannot make, an entry in NCIC. Another option is to contact the local FBI of fice
for help. The Missing Children Act, reprinted beginning on page 155, givesthe FBI a concurrent man date to make an NCIC entry. If NCIC entry criteria are
met, the FBI should enter information about the child into NCIC.
Follow the steps noted below to report your child missing and help ensure
NCIC entry.
Call your local law-enforcement agency or missing-child clearinghouse to find
out what documentation you must present to file a missing-person re port
for your child. When you ask this question they may take your report overthe telephone, but it is still advisable to follow the next step.
Immediately go to your local law-enforcement agency with the necessary docu-
mentation and report your child missing. Give a complete description of your
child including a physical description, date of birth, age, grade in school,dental records, and circumstances of the disappearance. Also provide lawenforcement with complete descriptions of the abductor, the abductor’svehicle, and any accomplices. Provide recent photographs of your child, theabductor, and any accomplices. Use the “Missing-Person Report for an
Abducted Child” worksheet on page 261 to compile information. Bring it
with you to the law-enforcement agency. Also bring a certified copy of yourcustody order, if you have one, and a copy of your child’s birth certificate. Ifsome of this documentation cannot be easily obtained, do not wait to gatherall of it. You can make arrangements to send it later. Take this guide with youwhich contains key sections of the National Child Search Assistance Act,as amended, and Adam Walsh Act beginning respectively on pages 157and 158.
If you have trouble getting law enforcement to take a missing-person re port,
contact your missing-child clearinghouse or NCMEC for help.
Record the name, badge or ID number, and telephone number of the officer
who takes the missing-person report as well as the name of the department
and date.
Request a copy of the missing-person report. If you cannot get a copy, ask for
the case number. Give this information to NCMEC and any other miss-
ing-children organizations with which you are working.
Ask to have all information regarding your missing child entered into NCIC
within two hours of report receipt. If law enforcement is reluctant to perform
this task, explore the possibility of obtaining the NCIC forms from the inves-tigating officer and filling them out yourself. A missing-children organizationmay be able to help you complete the forms.

Ask Law Enforcement to Pursue a Missing-Person Investigation
Once your child’s description is entered in NCIC, ask law enforcement to pursuea missing-person investigation to locate your child. The Missing Children’sAssis tance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5780(3)(B), (C), requires law-enforcement agencies
entering missing-child reports into NCIC “to institute or assist with appropriatesearch and investigative procedures” and maintain close liaison with NCMEC
while working missing-children cases.
Missing-children investigations present unique difficulties to law-enforcement
agencies. They are labor-intensive investigations and frequently require expendi-
ture of significant resources to extend the investigation beyond the local city ortown. Moreover sophisticated document searches also require the services ofinvestigators trained in white-collar crime.
Encourage the officer investigating your case to contact the National Center

After a Missing Child Is Found

beginning on page 93.
Criminal Charges
State Criminal Charges
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted criminal, parental-kidnapping statutes to deter parental kidnapping and punish abductors.
12
The statutes go by different names including custodial interference, child ab duc-
tion, con cealment, and parental kidnapping. The elements of the offense vary.
Every state and the District of Columbia consider parental kidnapping a seriousfelony crime under some circumstances because of the risk of harm to the child
and disruption to the stability of the parent-child relationship. Felony crimes are
punishable by jail or prison terms longer than one year, by payment of a stiff fine,
or both. Many states also have laws treating parental kidnapping as less seriouscrimes called misdemeanors . Misdemeanors are punishable by incarceration in
jail for up to one year, by payment of a fine, or both.
Nearly every state expressly treats interstate parental kidnapping, ab duc-
tion across state lines as a felony. Extradition, the return of the defendant to thejurisdiction where the crime was committed, is permitted for felony crimes butnot usually for misdemeanors. An Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP)warrant can be obtained only if the underlying crime is a felony. UFAP warrants
are more fully discussed in the section titled “Fugitive Felon Act” beginning on
page 50.
Some states have made the concealment of the child a felony. Most such laws
require the abductor have knowledge of the custody order he or she is accused ofviolating. Some jurisdictions also require evidence the child has been taken fromthat jurisdiction. Only some of these criminal laws cover interference with visita-tion rights.
Defenses to abduction are available in some statutes including flight to
protect the child and flight from domestic violence. To take advantage of these
defenses some laws require victims who flee from domestic violence to notify lawenforcement within a specified period of time as to their whereabouts and seekappropriate relief in court.
In both misdemeanor and felony cases the judge may, but does not have to,
incarcerate a convicted offender. The judge may place an offender on probation- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 50and impose various conditions of probation such as a fine, restitution, commu-
nity service, or restrictions on leaving the community.
Parental kidnapping may be punishable under the laws of the jurisdiction to
which the child was taken as well as the jurisdiction from which the child wasabducted. If the local prosecutor in your jurisdiction does not or cannot prosecute
the case, for instance, if the facts of the case do not constitute a crime under your
local law, a prosecutor in another jurisdiction may be able to prosecute if a crimehas occurred under the laws of that jurisdiction.
Review the parental-kidnapping laws of your state as well as the state to
which your child was abducted. Statutory citations for parental-kidnappinglaws are listed in the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-AbductionLaws and Resources”  beginning on page 199.  You may be able to obtain copies of
parental-kidnapping laws from missing-child clearinghouses, missing-chil dren
organizations, your lawyer, law enforcement, the prosecutor, NCMEC at
1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632), or online by searching the statutory
citations listed on www.findlaw.com.
Also check the general kidnapping law and other criminal laws that might
apply to your case such as burglary, car theft, assault and battery. Share informa-tion about the abduction with law enforcement and the prosecutor so they canevaluate whether these other statutes apply.
If an abductor receives assistance from friends or relatives and sufficient evi-
dence exists to prove this, law-enforcement authorities and prosecutors should
not overlook filing charges against the ac complices to the crime.
Federal Criminal Charges
Two federal criminal statutes expressly apply to family-abduction cases. They arethe Fugitive Felon Act and International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act. The FBIhas jurisdiction to investigate alleged violations of these federal statutes. Otherfederal criminal statutes may also come into play in an abduction case, forinstance, passport-fraud statutes and conceivably the Military Extraterritorial
Jurisdiction Act of 2000.

Fugitive Felon Act  The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, Section 10, Pub. L.
No. 96-611, Dec. 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 3573, 18 U.S.C. § 1073 note, expresses
Congres sional intent that the Fugitive Felon Act applies to interstate- and inter-
national-abduction cases when an abductor flees the state or country to avoidprosecution under applicable felony statutes. The Fugitive Felon Act, 18 U.S.C. §1073, is a federal statute in aid of state prosecution. It allows state and local pros-ecutors to obtain the FBI’s help in finding and returning fugitives who have fled
the state or country to avoid felony prosecutions. The FBI be comes involved in
the investigation upon issuance of a UFAP warrant. Although federal criminalcharges are initially brought against the fugitive in connection with a UFAP , thosecharges are normally dropped once the fugitive is arrested, and the fugitive isprosecuted under state law upon return to that jurisdiction.
13Pub. L. No. 106-523, Sec 1, Nov. 22, 2000, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3261-3267, provides the members of the Armed
Forces and civilians employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces outside of the United States are subjectto criminal prosecution in the United States for conduct outside of the United States that would be punishableas a felony if committed within the United States. This statute provides a mechanism for returning the defendantto the United States. This law is reprinted beginning on page 186.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 51Left-behind parents interested in the issuance of a UFAP warrant should
direct their requests to the local or state prosecutor, not the FBI or U.S. Attor-
ney. It is up to the local or state prosecutor to apply for the warrant.
The prosecutor applies in writing to the U.S. Attorney or FBI for a UFAP
warrant under the Fugitive Felon Act. The prosecutor must give assurances that
the offender will be extradited for prosecution. There must also be evidence the
abductor has left the state. A UFAP warrant will not be issued if the abductor’swhereabouts are known, since in such cases the prosecutor can begin extraditionwithout the help of the FBI. An exception is made in international-abductioncases such that if a UFAP warrant is issued the FBI investigates the case. If thefugitive-parent has fled to another country, the FBI may call upon foreign law-enforcement authorities to investigate. If the FBI locates the abductor in the UnitedStates, the FBI makes the arrest and turns the abductor over to local authoritiesfor extradition and prosecution. If the abductor is located in another country,
U.S. law-enforcement authorities must request assistance from their foreign coun-
terparts to make an arrest. The FBI does not have jurisdiction in other countries.
The FBI’s investigation pursuant to a UFAP warrant is directed at finding and
returning the fugitive. The child is not the focus of the investigation; however, ifthe FBI locates the child in the course of their investigation they may alert
local child-welfare authorities and the left-behind parent, who can then pursuerecovery of the child. If the child is present when the abductor is arrested, the FBIcan turn the child over to local authorities. If the abductor is located but the childis not, the left-behind parent must continue to search for the child on his or
her own.
The International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act  IPKCA makes it a federal felony to
remove a child younger than 16 from the United States, or attempt to do so, or
retain a child outside the United States with the intent to obstruct the lawfulexercise of parental rights. IPKCA defines parental rights as the right to physicalcustody of the child, including visitation rights, whether the right is joint or soleand whether the right arises by operation of law, court order, or legally bindingagreement of the parties. IPKCA provides affirmative defenses if the defendant
was acting within the provisions of a valid custody or visitation order; was fleeing
an incidence or pattern of domestic violence; or failed to return the child due tocircumstances beyond his or her control and notified or made reasonable attemptsto notify the other parent within 24 hours and returned the child as soon aspossible. Violation of the statute is punishable by a fine, by up to 3 years ofimprisonment, or both.
The U.S. Attorney, usually in the district from which the child was taken, has
authority to bring IPKCA charges in an international-abduction case. In decidingwhether to bring charges under IPKCA, the U.S. Attorney considers, amongother things, whether state charges are pending that could effectively resolve thecase, and whether IPKCA is the only charging option such as when an offensecannot be charged under state law. For instance pre-decree abductions andvisitation interference frequently are chargeable only under IPKCA. If theabduction is to a Hague Convention country, the U.S. Attorney will consider
whether a civil remedy has been or may be sought under the Hague Convention
and how criminal prosecution might affect return proceedings. If the abductionis to a non-Hague Convention country, the U.S. Attorney will consider whetherextradition from that country is feasible.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 52The FBI investigates IPKCA violations, usually following a complaint by the
left-behind parent. As in UFAP investigations, the FBI’s goal is to find and appre-
hend the abductor. If the child is located as a result of the investigation, the actualreturn of the child must be arranged by the parent.
Pressing Charges
Many law-enforcement agencies do not treat parental kidnapping as a seriouscriminal act and are reluctant to commit the law-enforcement resources neces-sary to fully investigate, in part because of their belief some victimized parentspress charges in order to barter for the return of the child only to drop the chargeslater when the child is located.
You must seriously consider whether you want the abductor to be prosecuted.
Think about how your child will react to having a parent arrested, tried, andpossibly sent to jail. Realize if you have a change of heart, you may not be able tostop a prosecution later on. Your child and you, as well as other relatives and close
friends, may be called on to testify in the criminal trial. This will pro long your
involvement with the criminal-justice system and may make psychologicalrecovery more difficult for both your child and you. If your child is called to
testify as a witness, call NCMEC at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632) torequest a copy of Just in case...Guidelines in case your child is testifying in court .

Toaccomplish this you will have to go back to civil court to modify the custodyorder. Criminal charges can complicate child-recovery efforts in international-abduction cases involving Hague Convention countries. See the section titled
“Pursuing Federal Criminal Charges In International-Abduction Cases” onpage 54.
On the positive side a felony warrant may be the determining factor in a
recovery. Some jurisdictions will render assistance in abduction cases only if thereis a criminal warrant. A criminal court may exert continuing authority over theabductor through conditions of the sentence that may help prevent a reabduction.
If you are determined to have the abductor criminally charged, prosecuted,
and punished and are willing to assist law enforcement, prosecutors, and thecourt as requested, then it is appropriate for you to pursue criminal charges againstthe abductor and accomplices, assuming the abduction is punishable under stateor federal law.
Pursuing State Criminal Charges  Follow the steps noted below to pursue  state crimi-
nal charges  against the abductor.
Review the criminal parental-kidnapping laws in your state and the state in
which your child is located. Use the section titled “Nationwide Directory of
Family-Abduction Laws and Resources,” beginning on page 199,  to find statu-
tory citations. Make copies of these laws.
Be prepared to show law enforcement or the prosecutor how the laws
apply in your case. You may find it useful to talk to your lawyer, missing-child
clearinghouse officials, or a missing-children organization such as NCMECbefore you talk to law enforcement or the prosecutor. Be awareFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -•There is confusion about whether criminal charges can be brought against
a parent who abducts a child in violation of a joint-custody order. Some
states have passed laws making it clear criminal-custodial-interference lawsapply to joint-custody orders. In jurisdictions without such laws legalarguments can be made that a joint custodial parent who unilaterally takesa child without consent violates the joint custodial parent’s rights. Themore detailed the joint-custody order is about the child’s residential
arrangements, the easier it will be to establish that a criminal-law viola-
tion has occurred. Even if criminal charges are not filed against theabductor, your rights under the joint-custody order can still be enforcedin civil court once your child is located.
•There may be confusion about which jurisdiction can charge the crime.
Generally speaking the jurisdiction from which the child was taken charges
the abductor with a crime. When the initial taking is lawful but the child issubsequently wrongfully retained, for instance when a lawful visit becomesan unlawful holdover, the wrongful retention may be a crime in both thejurisdiction in which it occurred and the jurisdiction from which the childwas originally removed. It should not matter if the violated court order
was obtained in another state provided the order is valid.
•Law-enforcement authorities may be reluctant to act if presented with
conflicting custody orders – your order and one obtained by the
abductor in another jurisdiction. The best way to avoid this legallyambiguous situation is to promptly file or register your custody determi-nation in a civil court in the state to which the abductor has taken yourchild. The UCCJA authorizes such filings, and the UCCJEA has a specialregistration process. The more quickly you act the better your chances of
preventing the abductor or accomplice from getting a custody order from
a local court.
Call the local prosecutor’s office and find out who makes the decision to file
criminal charges in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred. It may belaw enforcement, the prosecutor, or a local magistrate. Then make anappointment to speak to the person who makes such decisions. You maywant to have your lawyer or a representative of a missing-children organi-zation attend this meeting with you. Take a certified copy of your custodydecree with you, which you can obtain from the clerk of the court.
If law enforcement, the prosecutor, or a magistrate has questions about
the operation of the criminal laws, ask them to call NCMEC’s Missing
Children Division at 1-888-24- NCMEC (1-888-246-2632) and ask to speak
with a lawyer.
Request felony rather than misdemeanor  charges if appropriate under that
jurisdiction’s law. Felony charges are more serious and more law-en force-
ment resources can be assigned to resolve them including increasing the easeof searching for your child outside of your jurisdiction. Felony charges enableissuance of a nationwide warrant for arrest of the abductor through the NCICWanted Person File. Felony charges also enable the prosecutor to seek afederal UFAP warrant so the FBI can provide investigative assistance if theabductor has left the state.
If you cannot obtain a felony charge ask for misdemeanor charges. Use this
opportunity to discuss with the prosecutor or law enforcement the use of
53- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 54subpoenas or search warrants and other special investigative tools to obtain
private records in the search for the abductor and your child. These are morefully discussed in the chapter titled “Searching for Your Child” beginning onpage 63.
If an arrest warrant is issued, ask for the warrant number along with the NCIC
Wanted Person File number. You should use the warrant number on posters
or fliers of your missing child. All NCIC entries for the abductor and yourchild should be cross-referenced.
You can help law enforcement with their investigation by providing family
background information including the abductor’s marital status, child-
support obligations, whether the abductor is receiving welfare as sistance,
whether complaints about or prosecutions for domestic violence or child abusehave occurred in the past, and the status of custody orders and custody-related court proceedings.
Pursuing Federal Criminal Charges In International-Abduction Cases  Parents of
children abducted from the United States to other countries, or wrongfully kept
in another country should follow the steps noted below to pursue federal crimi-
nal charges  against the abductor.
Contact the nearest FBI field office to request an investigation. Check your
local telephone directory for the number or visit www.fbi.gov. From the home
page click on the “Your Local FBI Office” link. Arrange a meeting with an FBISpecial Agent, preferably the Crimes Against Children Coordinator, to dis-cuss what the FBI can do and what you should do. The FBI Special Agent canget technical assistance from the FBI’s Crimes Against Children Unit in Wash-ington, DC, at 202-324-3666. Information about this Unit is available on the
FBI’s website at www.fbi.gov. From the home page, in the “Search” field, type
“Crimes Against Children.”
Contact the U.S. Attorney’s Office to arrange a meeting, in person or by tele-
phone, with an Assistant U.S. Attorney to discuss the possibility of the federal
government charging the abductor under the International Parental Kidnap-ping Crime Act. Have a copy of IPKCA, found beginning on page 178, handyfor your reference and, if need be, to familiarize the federal prosecutor withthe law. The U.S. Attorney can get technical assistance with IPKCA prosecu-tions from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, ChildExploitation & Obscenity Section at 202-514-5780 and on in ternational
extradition from the Office of International Affairs at 202-514-0000. Informa-tion about these sections is also available at www.usdoj.gov. From the home
page click on the “DOJ Agencies” link. Then respectively click on the
“Criminal Division” and “Child Exploitation & Obscenity Section” links.
Also from the home page, in the “Search” field, type “Of fice of Interna-
tional Affairs” and select the links of interest.
Convincing the Prosecutor to Prosecute  The prosecutor has discretion in deciding to
prosecute a case. In other words it is up to the prosecutor to decide which casesare prosecuted and which are not. You cannot force a prosecutor to prosecute acase; however, there may be ways to raise the profile of your case, which in turnmay influence the prosecutor’s decision to prosecute.TROUBLE
SHOOTINGFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -55If a prosecutor fails to file criminal charges without justification , ask to speak
to a supervisor. Consider making an appointment to speak with or send a
letter directly to the elected or appointed prosecutor.
Rally public support for prosecution.
•Ask local and/or federal politicians to contact the prosecutor in regard to
the abduction.
•Obtain help from your missing-child clearinghouse or a missing-children organization.
•Organize your family and community groups to begin a letter-writing campaign.
•Seek media coverage of your child’s abduction emphasizing the need forcriminal prosecution. Before you do this, read the chapter titled “Search-
ing for Your Child” beginning on page 63.
Consider joining with other victimized parents to advocate for changes in the
laws and law-enforcement policies.
•Ask law-enforcement agencies to establish written policies about parental-kidnapping and missing-child cases.
•Request local law-enforcement officers and prosecutors to participate intraining courses about handling parental-kidnapping and missing-
children cases. Visit www.amber-net.org for programs offered inconjunction with the federal AMBER Alert program andwww.missingkids.com for programs offered by NCMEC. From the homepage click on the “Training” link.
•Missing-child clearinghouses and missing-children organizations
may also be of assistance.
•Do not overlook the influence of your local political parties and their elec-tion platforms.
The Criminal Investigation
Law-enforcement authorities investigate criminal family-abduction cases in many
ways. Some methods are summarized in this section to give parents an idea ofwhat a criminal investigation involves. Other investigative tools law enforcementmay use are outlined in the chapter titled “Searching for Your Child” beginningon page 63.
An excellent guide to investigating family-abduction cases, Missing and Abducted
Children: A Law-Enforcement Guide to Case Investigation and Program Management , is
available to law enforcement free-of-charge from NCMEC at www.missingkids.com.From the home page click on the “More Publications” link. Then click on the“Abduction” link and scroll down to the “Investigator’s Package” link. A copy mayalso be obtained by calling NCMEC toll-free at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632).
Felony Warrants
Most importantly, if the abductor is charged with a felony, law enforcement shouldimmediately enter the arrest warrant into the NCIC Wanted Person File fornational dissemination to law-enforcement agencies. Misdemeanor war rants
will go only into a statewide computer system. All NCIC entries concerning theabductor and missing child should be cross-referenced.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEINTERPOL
Law-enforcement authorities handling international, parental-kidnapping cases
should contact USNCB-INTERPOL at 202-616-9000 for assistance. Additionalinformation is available at www.usdoj.gov/usncb.
“Be-on-the-Lookout” Bulletins
Law enforcement can issue “Be-on-the-Lookout” bulletins, also called BOLOs,Attempts to Locate (ATLs), or All Points Bulletins (APBs), to help other law-enforcement agencies find an abductor’s vehicle. These bulletins, however, are oflimited value unless law enforcement is in hot pursuit of the abductor or has areasonable idea of where the abductor is fleeing.
Mail Covers
This investigative tool is available to law-enforcement authorities only and can beused only when a felony is under investigation. It allows the U.S. Postal Service tonote return addresses and postmark information on mail believed to be useful inlocating a fugitive. The information is given to law-enforcement officials only for
use in an official investigation. You can help by giving the investigating officer a
list of important dates, such as anniversaries, birthdays, deaths, and weddings,
that might trigger a communication from the abductor to relatives or
friends. Law e nforcement should consult with the local Postal Inspector for
guidance in requesting mail covers.
Use SSN, DMV, Nlets
Law enforcement in some jurisdictions can run an abductor’s name and Social
Security Number (SSN) in a computer-match program against the Departmentof Motor Vehicles (DMV) records of all 50 states and the District of Columbia.Information about driver’s licenses and motor-vehicle violations may be usefulin locating the abductor. Law enforcement can run the v ehicle identification
number (VIN) in the same manner to ascertain if the abductor’s ve hicle has
been registered or titled in another jurisdiction. Law enforcement can also checkwith the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) to determine if any insuranceclaims have been made on the vehicle. Similarly law-enforcement authorities inmost jurisdictions can run a computer-match program through an Nlets, TheInternational Justice and Public Safety Network, teletype, which may pick-up
additional information about the abductor’s movements or whereabouts.
Search Warrants and Subpoenas
Law-enforcement investigators can use search warrants for the abductor’s formerresidence to determine if the abductor left behind any clues. Law enforcementcan use subpoenas to gain access to telephone records, mail-forwardinginforma tion, and credit-card records. It will frequently be necessary to trace the
abducting parent’s source of income or financial support. Parental-kidnappinginvestigations can be similar to investigations involving white-collar crime. See
the section titled “Sources of Information,” beginning on page 68, for thetypes of documents law enforcement may try to obtain.
56FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 57Outstanding Warrants
Law-enforcement investigators can periodically check for outstanding warrants.
Missing-Child Clearinghouses
A missing-child clearinghouse has been established in every state, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. Many clearinghousesare within state law-enforcement agencies and assist local law-enforcement agen-cies with missing-child investigations. Investigating officers may contact theirmissing-child clearinghouse for assistance. Contact information is listed in the
section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws and Resources,”
beginning on page 199.
Parent Locator Service
The Federal Parent Locator Service ( FPLS) is a computerized national location
network operated by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). FPLS
was originally established to provide address information to state and local child-support agen cies to locate absent parents. All states, the District of Columbia,
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands participate in the federal child-
support-enforcement program of which the Parent Locator Service is a part.
The PKPA expanded ac cess to the FPLS to “authorized persons” in criminal,
parental-kidnapping and civil, child-custody cases. Law-enforcement officers and
prosecutors are “autho rized persons” for purposes of accessing FPLS informa-
tion. State prosecutors and law-enforcement officials gain access to addressinformation in the FPLS database by applying to the State Parent Locator
Service. Federal law-enforcement agencies and prosecutors have di rect
access to the FPLS. See the chapter titled “Searching for Your Child,” begin-
ning on page 63, for a detailed description of the FPLS. State Parent Locator
Services may also be accessible to law enforcement in connection with pa rental-
kidnap ping investigations.
Flagging Records
Law enforcement can flag a child’s birth certificate and school records as a means
of locating the child and abductor.
Project ALERT
Created by NCMEC in 1992, Project ALERT (America’s Law Enforcement RetireeTeam) enlists retired law-enforcement professionals from around the country toprovide on-site assistance and consultation to requesting law-enforcement agen-
cies in domestic and international cases of missing, abducted, and sexuallyexploited children.  Assistance is offered free-of- charge solely for the benefit of
the investigating agency. In addition to evaluating, developing, and suggestingnew approaches to cases, the volunteers are also available for public-speaking andcommunity-awareness programs. Law enforcement may obtain more informa-tion about Project ALERT toll-free at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632).- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 58The Arrest
Ask law enforcement to keep you informed about the status of your case espe-
cially when an arrest is imminent. Follow the instructions of the arresting officerregarding where you should be at the time of the arrest. Do not go to the scene of
the arrest unless you are requested to do so by the arresting officer.
Important advice for law enforcement about making arrests in family-
abduction cases is contained in NCMEC’s publication titled Missing and
Abducted Children: A Law-Enforcement Guide to Case Investigation and ProgramManagement. This guide is available at www.missingkids.com. From the homepage click on the “More Publications” link. Then click on the “ Abduction”link and scroll to the “Investigator’s Package” link. A free copy may also beobtained by calling NCMEC at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632).
What happens to the child when the abductor is arrested? In a few states
law- enforcement authorities are directed by law to return a child to a lawful
custodian when the abductor is arrested. While laws in most jurisdictions do not
require this, in some places officers may return an abducted child to the lawful
custodian, upon proof of custody, as long as they are not prohibited from doingso. Some jurisdictions may require the left-behind parent to file or register his orher custody order in a local court. Certain laws, including the UCCJEA in manystates, may allow the prosecutor to go to court to obtain a pick-up order, whichwould direct law enforcement to bring the child to court for further action orturn the child over to the lawful custodian. Note:  Prosecutors who use civil legal
authority to recover a child most likely are not also pursuing criminal remedies,and thus the child’s pick-up probably is not attendant to the abductor’s arrest.
In many UCCJEA states, prosecutors or other designated public au thorities,
in addition to private attorneys, may petition a court for a pick-up order.Prosecutors in California have operated under a similar law for many yearsand are familiar with these cases and can react quickly. In states where thelaw is relatively new, designated public authorities may be unprepared, orunwilling, to respond in a timely way. Since time is of the essence, workingwith a private attorney may be the best way to proceed.
If law enforcement will not turn the child over to you until you obtain a local
court order, you will have to go to court to enforce your custody order. See the
chapter titled “Recovering Y our Child” beginning on page 93. Your lawyer
should coordinate with law enforcement so you have an enforcement order in
place when the abductor is arrested or as soon thereafter as possible. The UCCJEA,in effect in most states, provides a “next day” enforcement procedure and alsoprovides a mechanism in conjunction with an enforcement action to take physi-cal custody of the child to prevent an imminent abduction. It helps to have thecourt include language in the enforcement order directing law enforcement topick-up your child or accompany and assist you in the recovery.
Be prepared to travel on short notice to resume custody. Your presence might
be crucial at a hearing regarding release of your child. If you cannot afford totravel to the place where the arrest will be made, it may be possible to obtainfinancial assistance. For more information about possible assistance contact
NCMEC’s Family Advocacy Division at 1- 888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632),
your missing-child clearinghouse, a missing-children organization in your com-munity, or a victim-assistance program in the jurisdiction where your child isFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -59located. For contact information see the section titled “Nationwide Directory of
Family-Abduction Laws and Resources,” beginning on page 199.
If you are unable to pick-up your child at the time of the arrest, it may be
possible to ask a relative or friend to do so. Make arrangements with the law-
enforcement agency in advance  to help ensure they will release your child to
someone other than you. If law enforcement is unable to accommodate you in
this matter, it may be possible in some jurisdictions for you to temporarily placeyour child with a child-protective-services agency. If this occurs an additionalcourt hearing may be required before your child is released to your custody.
Extradition
When the abductor is arrested in another state, he or she may agree to returnvoluntarily to the jurisdiction in which the criminal charges are pending. Other-wise the prosecutor in that jurisdiction will have to extradite the abductor in
order for a criminal trial to take place. Extradition decisions involve consider-ation of the seriousness of the crime as well as the financial resources available to
the prosecutor to pay the expenses associated with transporting the abductor
back to that jurisdiction. Family-abduction cases compete with all other felonycrimes for priority in the budgeting of extradition funds. Not every offenderis extradited.
When an abductor is apprehended in another country, international extradi-
tion is the legal process used to secure the abductor’s return to the United Statesfor prosecution under state or federal law. Prosecutors coordinate extraditionthrough the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of International Affairs. Interna-tional extradition in parental-kidnapping cases depends on the United States
having an extradition treaty with the country of refuge. The country of refuge
must also be willing to extradite for parental kidnappings and its own nationals ifan abductor is a national of that country.
The United States has more than 100 extradition treaties in effect. The Extra-
dition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998 authorizes the United States to interpret“kidnapping” in “list” treaties to include parental kidnapping. The United Stateswill take this interpretation only if the foreign country does so as well. Key sec-tions of this Act and a policy statement regarding its interpretation are reprintedbeginning on page 183. The United States government may request extradition,but ultimately the decision to extradite is up to the foreign country.
State and local prosecutors may decide not to file criminal charges or seek
extradition in parental-kidnapping cases because of the costs involved in extra-diting fugitives. These include fees for transporting the abductor and escortoffic ers back to the jurisdiction and translating documents. Although the gov-
ernment should bear these costs, some parents have reported being asked tocover these costs. A different solution may be available in international, parental-kidnapping cases if an abductor is charged with violating IPKCA. In that case thefederal government would bear the cost of extradition. The local prosecutor orleft-behind parent can discuss possible IPKCA charges with the federal prosecutor.
It is critical to understand the abducted child is not subject to extradition.
When an abductor is arrested, authorities will inform the left-behind parent so heor she can take steps to recover the child. If the child is in another country, the- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEforeign government may be able to take the child into protective custody pend-
ing further proceedings under its own laws and procedures.
Conviction and Punishment
An abductor who is convicted of or pleads guilty to parental kidnapping will besentenced in accordance with the statute that has been violated. Because the courtmay have latitude in setting the punishment, the victim parent should attempt toexpress his or her views. Ask the prosecutor to seek an appropriately strict sen-tence. Consult with the prosecutor about submitting a “Victim-Impact Statement”
to the court prior to sentencing. Try to attend the sentencing hearing. Some juris-
dictions give the victim the right to be heard at sentencing.
Incarceration, in the form of a prison term, may be ordered. Be aware a judge
may be unwilling to impose jail time, or you may not want it. In those cases thecourt may place the abductor on probation. As a precaution against another abduc-tion the judge may order the abductor to report regularly to a probation officer,
or parole officer after incarceration, and prohibit travel outside of the jurisdictionwithout proper written approval. A court may also require the abductor to post abond for the duration of the probation period prior to resuming visitation with
the child. In a separate civil proceeding the left-behind parent may seek a bond
of longer duration and request supervised visitation for the abductor and otherappropriate prevention measures. S ee the chapter titled “Preventing Abductions”
beginning on page 9. A judge may fine the abductor and/or order the abductor tomake restitution to the left-behind parent for the costs of locating and recoveringa child.
Victim Compensation and Assistance
All states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto
Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is lands have established programs to provide com-
pensation and assistance to crime victims. Victim compensation programsreimburse victims for crime-related expenses such as medical costs, mental-health counseling, and lost wages or loss of support. Victim-assistance services,
provided by community-based or ganizations, include crisis intervention, coun-
seling, emergency shelter, and emergency transportation. In addition to such state
or territorial funds, crime-victim programs receive federal Victim of Crime Act
(VOCA) funding.
Each program is administered independently, and programs vary as to which
crimes are covered, are eligible, and have available compensation and assistance.Most programs were designed to aid victims of violent crimes. Some also aidvictims of nonviolent crimes including parental kidnapping. Some specificallyaddress the needs of the families of missing children.

by Patricia M. Hoff
Chapter Overview
It is essential for you to actively participate in the search for your child. This chap-
ter describes sources of information and assistance that may help you find yourchild. Below is a summary list of tips on conducting your own search .
1. File a missing-person report for your child with law enforcement and request
entry of information about your child into the Federal Bureau of Investigation’sNational Crime Information Center-Missing Person File (NCIC-MPF) with a
Child Abduction (“CA”) flag. In urgent cases meeting applicable criteria an
America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert may beissued to help locate your child. If so the AMBER Alert (AA) flag will be addedto the NCIC record.
2. Contact the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
® at 1-800-THE-LOST®
(1-800-843-5678); your missing-child clearinghouse; and nonprofit, missing-children organizations as listed in the section titled “Nationwide Directory ofFamily-Abduction Laws and Resources,” beginning on page 199, for informa-tion and assistance. Seek their advice about publicizing pictures of your child.Continue investigating the whereabouts of your child and abductor by
contacting sources listed in this chapter and developing leads on your own.
3. Stay in communication and coordinate with law enforcement and miss-
ing-children or ganizations investigating your case.
4. Try to remain calm. This will help you think more clearly as you organize and
conduct your search.
5. Be persistent but polite. Be prepared to explain your right to the information
you are seeking.
6. Because the abductor may not be using his or her real name, search for
information under different names such as the abductor’s maiden name,
variations of the name like first and middle names only, and a former ornew married name or aliases.
7. If you do not already have a fax machine, consider obtaining one to facilitate
quick, inexpensive communication with law enforcement, missing-chil dren
organizations, missing-child clearinghouses, the media, and others.
8. Consider carrying a cellular telephone or pager with caller ID so law enforce-
ment, missing-children organizations, and even the abductor can contact youwherever you are.
FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 63Searching for 
Your Child- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 9. Consider installing an answering machine with caller ID on your regular tele-
phone line(s) if you don’t already have this service. This will give you a record
of callers and their telephone numbers. Some local telephone companies offerthis service for a monthly fee.
10. Start a notebook. Keep a record of every person and agency you contact
including addresses and telephone numbers. Follow-up periodically with eachcontact. Keep a copy of all your correspondence concerning the abductionand search, and make notes of all actions taken on your behalf.
11. Use the chart beginning on page 89, and the worksheet titled “Key Contacts
in Parental-Kidnapping Cases” on page 259 to help organize your search.
12. It may help to keep a file of articles about other parental-kidnapping cases as
a source of ideas to aid in your search.
13. If the search continues beyond six months, repeat your efforts because the
abductor may have moved.
14. When your child is located, notify and thank every person, agency, organiza-
tion, and media outlet that helped you. This will allow them to focus theirenergies on other cases.

The Hotline is used by individuals to reportthe location of a missing child or of other children whose whereabouts areunknown to the child’s legal custodian and learn about the procedures necessary
to reunite a child with the child’s legal custodian.
NCMEC provides services free-of-charge to parents and families of missing
and sexually exploited children; state/territorial and federal law-enforcement
investigators and agencies handling cases of missing and sexually exploitedchildren; criminal-justice professionals and legal practitioners who work withmissing and sexually exploited children and their families; and nonprofitorganizations seeking access to a national network of resources and information.
NCMEC has certain intake criteria for domestic and international, family-
abduction cases. NCMEC takes cases of abducted children through the
Hotline upon determining the child was younger than 18 at the time of the
disappearance; the parent or other person reporting the case has temporaryor permanent custody of the child or visitation rights; and a missing-childreport has been filed with law enforcement. NCMEC also intakes cases fromlaw enforcement.
If a caller is not sure about the custody status of a minor child, has no custody
or visitation rights, or custody or visitation rights have not been determined,NCMEC does not intake the case, but offers technical assistance to help the per-- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEson get temporary or full custody, visitation rights, or whatever else is needed to
meet intake criteria.
NCMEC intakes incoming  international-abduction cases upon receipt of a
written application for return or access pursuant to the Hague Convention on theCivil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention). The childmust be younger than 16 for a Hague Convention application to be filed. Theapplicant need not have a custody order because the Hague Convention does
not require one. NCMEC intakes outgoing international-ab duction cases if
the parent or guardian has made a report to law enforcement and has full ortemporary custody or filed a Hague Convention application with the U.S.
Department of State or there is a federal warrant for the abductor under the
International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act.
In all cases, whether or not they meet intake criteria, NCMEC Call Center
Specialists determine if the caller has contacted law enforcement to file a missing-person report. If not the caller is advised to contact law enforcement to make areport. Trained Case Managers assist individuals and law-enforcement officials
in filing missing-person reports and can verify NCIC entries for childrenreported missing.
NCMEC maintains an up-to-date database of missing-children posters on
its website at www.missingkids.com. NCMEC can target poster dissemina-
tion to thousands of law-enforcement agencies, millions of commercial entities,and thousands of media contacts throughout the country through a broadcast faxservice. NCMEC coordinates national media exposure of missing-children casesand distributes millions of photographs of missing children through a network ofprivate-sector partners. Using electronic tools to age-enhance photographs of long-
term missing children, NCMEC creates an image of what the child may look like
today. If a case is registered with NCMEC , parents can use NCMEC’s toll-free
Hotline number on posters displaying the photograph of and information abouttheir missing child.
NCMEC can arrange transportation for custodial parents in the United States
who must travel to recover their abducted child if they meet certain eligibilityrequirements. Parents requiring assistance can contact NCMEC’s toll-free Hotlineat 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) to determine if they meet needs-based eli-gibility guidelines. In federal, criminal, international-parental-kidnapping cases,
NCMEC is able to provide financial assistance to parents who meet needs-based
criteria so they can attend court hearings in foreign countries and pay for a child’s
transportation back to the United States. The Victim Reunification Travel Pro-
gram is funded through a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office forVictims of Crime.
NCMEC’s Missing Children Division provides assistance to par ents of chil-
dren abducted to and from the United States. In addition to the services describedabove this Division also provides technical assistance to parents and lawyers; liaiseswith law enforcement; connects parents whose children are in another countrywith other parents in the same situation; and, as described above, provides finan-cial assistance to eligible parents to help fund the return of an abducted child tothe United States.
Team HOPE, part of NCMEC’s Family Advocacy Division, matches searching
families with experienced and trained volunteers who have experienced a miss-ing or abducted child. These volunteers offer emotional support, compassion,
66FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -guidance, empowerment, and assistance. To be matched with a volunteer, or for
more information, contact Team HOPE toll-free at 1-866-305-HOPE (1-866-305-4673) or by visiting www.teamhope.org.
Missing-Child Clearinghouses
Every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,and Canada have established a missing-child clearinghouse to assist parentsin locating and recovering their missing children. The scope of services pro-vided by these clearinghouses varies, but may include photo dissemination,assistance in obtaining information from local agency records, assistance in
having information about a missing child entered into NCIC, law-enforce-
ment training programs, referral to nonprofit organizations assisting with casesof missing children, and technical assistance in case investigations. Contact yourmissing-child clearinghouse, listed in the section titled “Nationwide Di rectory of
Family-Abduction Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199, to find outwhat services are available to you.
Nonprofit, Missing-Children Organizations
Missing-children organizations tend to have been established by victim parentsand other concerned individuals dedicated to the issues of missing and sexuallyexploited children. Most missing-children organizations are nonprofit organiza-tions (NPOs) offering services free-of-charge.
Services vary but may include helping a parent organize the search and
recovery process, helping to secure media coverage, acting as a liaison to lawenforcement, providing lawyer referrals, and networking with other missing-children organizations. These organizations become familiar with local law andprocedures and typically have contact with local law enforcement, lawyers, andsocial-service agencies.
Check the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws
and Resources,” beginning on page 199, for information about missing-children
organizations in your area. Or contact the Association of Missing and ExploitedChildrens Organizations (AMECO) toll-free at 1-877-263-2620, by dialing directly
at 703-838-8379, or by visiting www.amecoinc.org for a referral to a missing-
children organization. AMECO is a national association of missing- and sexuallyexploited-children organizations working together to serve and protect missingchildren and their families. Under a cooperative agreement with OJJDP,AMECO is authorized to develop national standards for NPOs servingmiss ing and sexually exploited children and their families and certify organi-
zations meeting those standards.

Other Sources of Help
Contact crime-victim-assistance programs to inquire about your eligibility
for help. These resources are described more fully in the chapter titled
67- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 68“Criminal Remedies in Family- Abduction Cases” beginning on page 41. You
may also receive help from other parents, concerned individuals, and religious
and community organizations.
Some members of the U.S. Congress have formed the Congressional Cau-
cus on Missing and Exploited Children  and Senate Caucus on Missing,
Exploited and Runaway Children , which have been instrumental in focusing
attention on international parental-kidnapping cases and improving the federalgovernment’s response in parental-kidnapping cases. You may contact your Con-gressional delegation for help with your case and referral to a caucus member.Telephone numbers for members of Congress may be obtained by calling 202-224-3121 or visiting www.house.gov, for information about members of the U.S.House of Representatives, and www.senate.gov for information about membersof the U.S. Senate.
Sources of Information
Many sources of information are available to help in the search for an ab ducted
child and the abductor.
Use the checklist beginning on page 89 to record your efforts. Other helpful
worksheets include “Key Contacts in Parental-Kidnapping Cases,” “Missing-Person Report for an Abducted Child,” “Missing-Child Poster,” “Sample Re quest
to Use the Federal Parent Locator Service to Locate a Parent or Child,” and“Sample Request Regarding School Records” beginning on page 259.
Caveat: Privacy laws and policies may make it difficult or impossible for you
to voluntarily obtain some information, in which case a subpoena or court orderrequiring disclosure may be necessary. You can conserve your financial resourcesand save time by identifying those sources that will not release information withouta subpoena or court order and then choosing those most likely to have informationabout your case. Then work with your lawyer to obtain the necessary subpoenasand any other civil-court orders for this information. If criminal charges are being
investigated, law enforcement or the prosecutor may be able to obtain issuance
of criminal subpoenas or search warrants to obtain the desired information.
Airlines, Buses, and Trains
Contact the airlines to find out if the abductor and child have reservations for aflight. If the abductor recently left the area, show pictures of the abductor andyour child to employees at airline terminals they would have been likely to use.You may have even better success if you give copies of your child’s picture toairline employees to post in employee meeting places. Look for the abductor’s carin airport parking lots. This may help verify the abductor has left the area. Aparking stub can help narrow the time and date of departure and let you focus onparticular flights the abductor may have taken. Likewise check bus stations andtrain terminals to find out if the abductor and your child used either of thesemodes of transportation to leave the area. Remember abductors may use remoteor distant transportation facilities instead of those closest to the abduction site.TROUBLE
SHOOTINGFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Alcohol and Drug Rehabilitation Centers
If the abductor has an alcohol or drug dependency problem, check with alcohol
or drug rehabilitation programs and the Alcoholics Anonymous chapter in yourcommunity as well as in the area where you think the abductor may be.
Banks and Other Financial Institutions
“Follow the money.” Check with the abductor’s bank, credit union, and othersuch financial institutions to find out if an account has been closed and, if so,whether funds have been transferred to another account or financial institution.Request records of transactions for several months prior to the abduction and askfor copies of cashed checks returned since the abduction. If the account was closed
and funds were taken in the form of a cashier’s check, find out where it was
cashed or deposited. Find out if direct deposits have been made to the abductor’saccount, and, if so, determine the source of the funds. If a checking account remainsopen, find out whether any checks have been used since the abduction. If so tracknew transactions. Ask for address information pertaining to the abductor.
Banks will cooperate if the account in question is a joint account or if you are
still legally married to the abductor. A few may be willing to help even if theaccount belonged only to the abductor, but most will require a court order for therelease of these records.
If the abductor has investments with a brokerage firm/mutual fund com-
pany or owns stock directly with a company, check with these sources foraddress information.
Birth Records
Parents are sometimes required to produce a child’s birth certificate, for instance,to get a passport for a child, enroll a child in school, and verify a child’s age forcertain competitive sports teams. Left-behind parents should ask the agency thatmaintains birth records, such as the Bureau of Vital Statistics, to flag your child’sbirth certificate. Depending on the flagging laws and policies in your state, the
agency may notify law enforcement or a left-behind parent if it receives a request
from the abductor for a copy of the birth certificate. Current address informationfor the abductor may be obtained this way. See the section titled “Nationwide
Directory of Family-Abduction Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199 forinformation about the missing-children laws in your state. School records mayalso be flagged in this manner. For additional information about this, see the sec-
tion titled “Schools and School Records” beginning on page 83.
Child-Protection Agencies
Check with child-protective-service agencies to find out if there have been anyreports of child abuse, abandonment, or neglect concerning your child or if yourchild has been placed in foster care or protective custody.
69- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEChild-Snatching Lawsuits
While not suited for all family-abduction cases, the discovery phase of these
lawsuits may produce information useful in locating an abductor and child.These lawsuits are discussed more fully in the section titled “Child-SnatchingLawsuits” on page 38.
Clubs and Organizations
Ask clubs and organizations frequented by the abductor for any information theymay have about the abductor’s whereabouts. They may have been notified of achange in address. Think of hobbies and sports the abductor has pursued. Onceyou focus your search on a particular geographic location, check local team regis-trations and hobby material suppliers for information.
College and Trade-School Transcripts
An abductor who attended college or trade school may request transcripts inorder to apply for jobs or pursue higher education. Contact the school registrar tofind out if the abductor has made such a request. If so find out where thetranscripts were sent. Contact career offices to find out if the abductor hasrequested placement services or job references. Ask to be alerted if the abductor
contacts these offices.
Compelling Abductor’s Lawyer to Disclose Address Information
Ordinarily the attorney-client privilege requires an attorney to keep information
about the client confidential; however, this rule is not absolute. A few courts haverequired an abductor’s lawyer to reveal the address of the abductor or abductedchild on grounds the child’s best interests took precedence over the lawyer- client
confidentiality rule. Check the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-
Abduction Laws and Resources,” beginning on page 199, for informationabout attorney-disclosure cases.
Computerized Databases
Publicly available records and publications such as real-property records andtelephone directories may provide leads as to the abductor’s and abductedchild’s whereabouts.
NCMEC has access to several commercial databases of public records, which
may be used to locate missing children who are registered with NCMEC. Thesedatabases may provide more current information than is available in telephonebooks, cross-directories, and other printed sources. It is advantageous for left-behind parents to have NCMEC access these databases because searches ofcommercial databases can be expensive.
Court Records
Once you focus your search on a particular geographic area, check records of allcourts to determine if the abductor is a plaintiff or defendant in any civil or crimi-
70FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -nal case. Address information should be available from court records in most
cases, although courts often protect address information from disclosure
in domes tic-violence cases. Also try to find out if the child is the subject of a
child-protection proceeding.
Credit Bureaus
Several commercial companies, such as Equifax, ExperianSM, and TransUnion®,
maintain national files about each individual’s credit purchases. Contact these
companies and ask for the abductor’s current address information. Contactinformation for these companies can be found in most local telephone books orat their respective websites of www.equifax.com, www.experian
SM.com, and
www.transunion®.com. If necessary ask a court to order the credit bureaus to flag
the abductor’s records and report relevant address information to you.
Credit Cards
If the abductor has credit cards, contact the credit-card companies and askfor duplicate copies of all of the abductor’s charges. Trace the locations wherepurchases were made to see if any patterns emerge. Many purchases made inthe same place over a period of time may indicate the abductor has taken upresidence. Pay special attention to gasoline credit-card records, which may
provide a trail leading to the abductor. You should be able to obtain the credit
information if you have a joint credit-card account with the abductor. If the
line of credit extends only to the abductor, the company may choose not torelease any information to you on privacy grounds, but it should comply withcourt-ordered disclosure.
Cross-Directories
Several companies publish directories  cross-referencing addresses with telephone
numbers and providing additional information about the residents of an address.For example if you have a telephone number the cross-directory will provide theaddress for that number. If you have an address it will list the telephone number.Cross-directories have been compiled for most metropolitan areas. Law-enforcementagencies frequently have a copy of the local cross-directory and may allow you to useit. Also check public libraries, child-support-enforcement offices, local chambers ofcommerce, or missing-children organizations. Cross-directories are also available onthe Internet. Go to an online search engine such as AltaVista
TM, GoogleTM, or Yahoo!®
and search “Cross Directory.” Also see the section titled “Telephone Directories” on
page 85.
Department of Homeland Security
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002. Border-protection functions once performed by the U.S. Customs Service andImmigra tion and Naturalization Service are now performed by two new agen-
cies in DHS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigrationand Customs Enforcement (ICE). Both CBP and ICE use the computerized Inter-agency Border Inspection System (IBIS) to check the status of people entering the
71- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEUnited States and sometimes the status of people who leave the United States.
IBIS is linked to various federal databases. An IBIS query will reveal NCIC recordsand lookouts placed in IBIS by the FBI, INTERPOL, or other federal law-enforce-ment agencies, any of which may result in identifying an abductor and child asthey attempt to leave or reenter the country. If there is a “hit,” Border Agents
notify the law-enforce ment agency that placed the record in NCIC. A parent
cannot access IBIS; however, a parent can help ensure information about the
abducted child is accessible to IBIS by asking law enforcement to enter infor-mation about the child in NCIC.
Abductors who are foreign nationals may at some point contact ICE
regarding their visa status. Upon request of a left-behind parent, ICE mayflag visa-related communications from the abductor. And law enforcementmay be able to have this information flagged if the parent cannot. See the
chapter titled “International Child Abduction” beginning on page 105.
Department of Motor Vehicles
Ask the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in your state to check aboutrecent vehicle registrations, title transfers, new licenses, and license renewals inthe abductor’s name. If there is a new-car registration, it may be possible to findout the name of the car dealership that sold the car. Contacting the dealer mayproduce the abductor’s contact information.
Warning: Some jurisdictions may notify individuals when inquiries are made
about them. Ask the DMV’s public-information officer if a notification policy
is in effect. If so do not use the DMV as a source of information if you believe theabductor will flee once he or she finds out a request has been made. Law enforce-ment may be able to get this information without alerting the abductor, or a courtcan order the DMV not to alert the abductor.
Employers
Check with the abductor’s last-known employer to find out where paychecksand health-insurance paperwork are being mailed. The employer may also tellyou if the abductor has requested a job reference and, if so, the origin of therequest and where references were sent. Ask to be alerted if the abductor contactsthe company. Find out whom the abductor listed as emergency contacts and ben-eficiary for insurance policies. Consider checking with those individuals. Talk tothe abductor’s coworkers, but before you do see the section titled  “Friends
and Relatives of the Abductor” beginning on page 73.
Extracurricular Programs
Send a poster or news release and photograph of your child with a letter tobefore- and after-school, childcare, park, recreation, and youth-activity programs;Campfire Girls; homeless shelters; public libraries; scouts; and YMCAs/YWCAs.Scouting organizations and regional parent-teacher associations can provide theaddress of local chapters. Contact individual cities and counties to learn abouttheir park and recreation programs as well as other childcare, civic, and youth-activity programs.
72FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Federal Buildings
Federal agencies are required to post missing-children fliers in federal buildings
pursuant to an Executive Order signed by President Clinton in 1996. NCMECcoordinates this program. For additional information contact NCMEC’s PhotoDistribution Program at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632).
Federal Citizen Information Center, National Contact Center
Information is available from this Center about all Military Locator Servicesand other federal programs that may be of assistance in helping to locate amissing child. Call toll-free at 1-800-FED-INFO (1-800-333-4636) or visitwww.usa.gov. From the home page, in the “Search” field, type “Military Lo cator
Services” and “Missing Child.”
Federal Letter-Forwarding Programs
The Social Security Administration (SSA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)have letter-forwarding services that can be used to attempt to forward a letter toa missing person for humane reasons. An appeal to the abductor may resultin a response.
If you would like the SSA to attempt to forward a letter to your child or the
abductor, place a personal letter addressed to the abductor and/or child in a blank,unstamped, and unsealed envelope. Place that envelope in another envelope andaddress that second envelope to the Social Security Administration, Letter For-warding, PO Box 33022, Baltimore, MD 21290-3022. In your request to forwardthe letter include information about your child and abductor such as their fullnames, Social Security Numbers, dates and places of birth, father’s and mother’sfull birth names, last known addresses, date of abduction, date the missing-person report was filed, date of last contact, and information about otherattempts you have made to contact them.
Requests to the IRS for letter forwarding should be sent in the same way to
the Internal Revenue Service, Office of Disclosure Operations, 1111 ConstitutionAvenue, Northwest, Washington, DC 20224-0002. A Social Security Number isrequired for the IRS to consider a letter-forwarding request. More informationabout this program is available at www.irs.gov. From the home page, inthe “Search” field, type “P-1- 187.”
Firearm Registrations/Licenses
If the abductor owns a firearm, contact local agencies to inquire if it is registered.Check under the child’s name as well. Find out if the abductor or child hasobtained a hunting license. Any paperwork required to be filed by the abductorand/or child would likely contain address information.
Friends and Relatives of the Abductor
Relatives, friends, and coworkers of the abductor may have useful leads about theabductor’s whereabouts, because abductors may talk about their plans and fre-quently receive assistance from others in taking or concealing a child. Give law
73- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEenforcement and your lawyer a list of individuals who may have relevant infor-
mation. Include their full names, addresses, birth dates, and telephone numbers.Your lawyer may decide to subpoena individuals to testify under oath. If criminalproceedings are under way, the local prosecutor may also subpoena individualsto testify.
If you are on good terms with the abductor’s parents or siblings, stay in touch
with them. Ask them to tell you if they hear from the abductor. If they receivemail from the abductor, ask them to save the envelopes because the information
contained in postmarks can provide good leads.
Be careful not to provoke the abductor by your overtures to relatives and
friends. Your tone should be controlled and nonthreatening, as this approach canhave a disarming effect on the abductor’s family or friends. Convey your hurt,frustration, confusion, and/or sense of betrayal. Be careful not to create theimpression you accept what the abductor has done. Do not reveal information
about your search that could be used by the abductor to better conceal your child.
Focus your search on places where the abductor has previously lived or is
likely to have gone. Interview old friends and neighbors since the abductor may
have sought their help. Talk to the abductor’s former coworkers and employers.If the abductor has a new spouse or partner, track down leads about that personas well. Find out where jobs in the abductor’s line of work are readily available,and try to talk to people the abductor may have encountered through work.
Garbage
Think of this as “trash talking.” If you act quickly, you may be able to examine theabductor’s trash for clues as to where he or she may have gone. Papers, such asold letters, old telephone bills, holiday and birthday cards, may contain informa-tion about the abductor’s intentions. Also consider checking the garbage ofanyone who may be helping the abductor conceal the child. You should deter-
mine the legality of this technique before you use it, however, because some courts
have extended privacy rights to garbage. If your jurisdiction protects privacy
rights to garbage, obtain a court order allowing you access to it. But be carefulnot to trespass on private property. Keep in mind law enforcement may haveaccess to this evidence even if you do not.
“Hangouts”
Check the kinds of places, such as bars, bowling alleys, cyber cafes, pool halls,and racetracks, the abductor would most likely frequent in the areas he or shemay have gone. Show people pictures of the abductor and your child.
Hunting and Fishing Licenses
If the abductor hunts or fishes, contact agencies issuing fish and gamelicenses to find out if a license has been issued in the abductor’s or child’sname. A teenage child may be required by law to obtain a license in his or herown name, or the abductor may be using the child’s name. Campsite registra-tions may also provide leads. Contact agencies that administer campsites suchas the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and state and local Depart-ments of Recreation or Natural Resources.
74FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Insurance
Contact insurance companies that have issued health, homeowner’s, life, and
vehicle policies to the abductor. Ask if the abductor has contacted the company,
and if so request current contact information. If insurance coverage has beenpurchased for a new vehicle, find out where the vehicle was bought and isgaraged. For life-insurance policies ask if there has been a recent change of ben-
eficiary or the ab ductor has taken a loan out against the policy. In both cases the
abductor may have supplied new address information. If the abductor has changedinsurance companies, call other companies to find out if the abductor is a newpolicyholder. If so try to get current contact information. Ask to be notified if the
abductor contacts the company.
Internet Sites
NCMEC has access to a variety of online databases to locate missing chil dren.
See the section titled “Computerized Databases” on page 70. In addition the
major browsers, such as AltaVistaTM, Excite®, GoogleTM, Lycos®, and Yahoo!® have
links to “people finders” and telephone directories. For instance in the “Search”line of the browser enter “People Finders” to bring up a list of potentially usefulwebsites. Three such websites are www.ussearch.com, www.whowhere.com, andwww.zabasearch.com.  There are many more. Some searches are free, but others
require a fee. Also see the section titled “Telephone Directories” on page 85.
Libraries
Ask local libraries if cards have been issued for the abductor and/or child. Try toget address information. Privacy policies may prevent libraries from volun-
tarily giving you this inform ation.
Loans
If the abductor has any outstanding loans, contact the lender, such as a bank,finance company, or vehicle dealership, to find out if payments are being made.Ask for the abductor’s current address. If unknown ask the lender to give you theenvelopes in which payments are mailed, because the information in the post-mark may be helpful. If the abductor makes payments by check, contact thebank on which funds are drawn for address information. If the lender has title tothe abductor’s vehicle, find out where the title will be sent when the loan is paidoff. If the abductor has defaulted on a loan, the lender may also be trying to locatethe abductor. Find out what collection agency the lender is using and offer to
exchange information. It is also worth contacting collection agencies for vehicle-leasing companies. Do not overlook student loans.
Magazine and Newspaper Subscriptions
Contact local newspapers in the abductor’s hometown to find out if the abductorhas taken a subscription or placed an ad. In some cases abductors have placedmessages in their hometown papers to communicate with friends and family
75- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEmembers left behind. Ask to be notified if the abductor contacts the paper. If the abductor has
subscriptions to any other magazines or newspapers, contact the company business offices tofind out where the publications are being sent.
Some of the numerous magazines and newspapers for service members are listed below. For
instance the Army Times Publishing Company publishes four weekly newspapers for current
and former U.S. military personnel. They are the Air Force Times, Army Times , Marine Corps
Times, and Navy Times. Contact information is listed below and also available at www.atpco.com.

Marriage-license records may provide address information as well as information
about a new married name. Check marriage-license records in your communityand other places the abductor may have gone.
Media Coverage
Publicity about your missing child, including magazine, newspaper, radio,and television coverage, may produce helpful leads. Immediate dissemina-tion of your child’s picture is recommended unless otherwise suggested bythe law-enforcement agency investigating the case. See the section titled “Pho-
tograph Dissemination,” beginning on page 81. Media will publicize the case
if an AMBER Alert is issued and may do so even if the case does not meet
AMBER Alert criteria.
If you have narrowed your search to a particular area, target media coverage
to that area. National media coverage may be most helpful when your child’swhereabouts are unknown, but may be difficult to obtain.
When you contact media be sure to have a recent photograph and complete
description of your child and the abductor, the numbers of any criminal war-rants for the abductor, and a contact number for local law enforcement. Providetelephone numbers where you can be reached at all times.
If you cannot obtain media attention, seek assistance from your missing-
child clearinghouse or a missing-children organization. NCMEC can also help
with media coverage. Call NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678).
Medical and Dental Records
Contact all of the abductor’s and child’s healthcare providers including dentists,doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies. Ask if they have received requests to sendrecords to another provider or entity and, if so, where the records were sent. Forinstance pediatricians frequently receive requests for a child’s immuniza-
tion records, which many daycare programs, schools, and summer camps
require when children enroll. Some national or regional chain pharmacies keep
computerized records of customers’ prescriptions, and you may be able to findout if the abductor has filled a prescription at a pharmacy within the chain. Askhealthcare providers to notify you or the investigating officer if the abductor con-tacts them. You should be able to get information about your child’s records, butmay not be able to get information about the abductor’s records voluntarilybecause of privacy issues.
Military Worldwide Locator Services
Each branch of the military has a worldwide locator service that can provideaddresses of active-duty personnel, reservists, and retirees. The locator servicemay be free to immediate family members and government officials.
Send a letter requesting the most recent duty assignment and location of the
abductor. Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope and as much identifyinginformation as possible about the person you wish to locate including full name,SSN, date of birth, rank, last known assignment, and last known address.
77- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEBefore you send the letter, call the locator service to find out if there are any
other requirements.

Office of Personnel Management
If the abductor is retired military personnel, a civil servant receiving a retirementcheck, or currently employed in the federal civil service, contact the U.S. Officeof Personnel Management (OPM) for current contact information about theabductor. This information may be available only by subpoena. You can reachOPM at 1900 E Street, Northwest, Washington, DC 20415-0001, 202-606-1800,
General@opm.gov, or www.opm.gov.
Parent Locator Services
The Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) is a computerized national locator
network operated by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services. Using the abductor’s name, date ofbirth, and SSN, the FPLS searches numerous government databases to gather
the most recent ad dress and employment information about the abductor and
child. Participating agencies include the Social Security Administration, InternalRevenue Service, U.S. Department of Defense/Office of Personnel Manage-
ment, U.S. Department of Treasury, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Department ofVeterans Affairs, State Employment Security Agencies, and National Directoryof New Hires.
The FPLS was originally established to provide address and SSN information
to child-support agencies to locate absent parents for child-suppor t-enforce-
ment purposes. The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. §663, broadened access to FPLS to authorized persons , who may request address
information for purposes of making or enforcing a child-custody order or investi-gating or prosecuting a criminal parental-kidnapping case. Authorized
persons  are any
Agent or attorney of any state who has the duty or authority under state law
to enforce child-custody or visitation determinations
Courts, or agents thereof, with jurisdiction to make or enforce a child-custodyor visitation determination
Agent or attorney of the United States or state with the duty or authorityto investigate, enforce, or bring a prosecution with respect to the unlawful
taking or restraint of a child
Parents are not “authorized persons” and therefore do not have direct access
to address information from the FPLS. Parents can ask authorized persons  to
make FPLS requests. For example left-behind parents or their lawyers may
ask the court to re quest an FPLS search to locate an abductor and child. There is
no set procedure for making a request. It may be informal, particularly if theparent is proceeding pro se or without an attorney. Or it may be a formal request
made in conjunction with a petition to make, modify, or enforce custody or visi-tation. Similarly a parent can request the appropriate government officials whoare authorized persons to make a location request, provided state law covers thewrongful taking or restraint of a child.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 80Parents can use the form titled “Sample Request to Use the Federal Parent
Locator Service to Locate a Parent or Child” on page 265 to request an FPLS
search. Requests are submitted to a state Parent Locator Service, which sends
them to the FPLS. Federal Agents and Attorneys have direct access to the FPLS
and do not need to go through a local office. Requests must include the abductor’s
name, date of birth, and SSN. If the SSN is not known, the FPLS will attempt to
ascertain it.
The FPLS sends address information it discovers to the requesting State Par-
ent Locater Service, which then communicates the information to the authorized
person who made the request or directly to the requesting Federal Agent orAttorney. Federal privacy laws require the information obtained in the FPLS be
used by the authorized person for official purposes and not be given to unautho-rized individuals. In custody and visitation cases where there is evidence ofdomestic violence or child abuse, courts may obtain address information but
further disclosure is restricted if it would endanger the parent or child.
The FPLS is authorized to charge the State Parent Locater Service a nominal fee
to process a parental-kidnapping search. The state may pass along this processing fee
to parents. Fees are not assessed against federal “authorized persons.”
Each state maintains a Parent Locator Service that searches for informa-
tion about absent parents in state government records. Check with your StateParent Locator Service to find out if it can be used to search for an abductorand abducted child. The section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws and Resources,” beginning on page 199, lists the locator
service in each jurisdiction. The FPLS can be contacted at 202-401-9267 or
visited at www.acf.hhs.gov. Under the “Working with ACF” heading click onthe “ ACF Programs” link. Then respectively click on the “Child SupportEnforcement” and “Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS)” links.

vice, see the brochure titled Just in case...Guidelines on using the Federal
Parent Locator Service in cases of parental kidnapping and child custody , avail-
able from NCMEC at www.missingkids.com. From the home page clickon the “More Publications” link. Then respectively click on the “Just in

Passports and Visas
Contact the U.S. Department of State’s Passport Lookout Program to find out ifyour child has been issued a U.S. passport and, if so, the address listed on thepassport application. You may also have your child’s name entered in the Children’sPassport Issuance Alert Program, which enables the Department to notify you if apassport application for your child is received anywhere in the United States or atany U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.
To place your child’s name in this lookout system contact the U.S. Depart-
ment of State, Office of Children’s Issues, SA-29, 2201 C Street, Northwest,Washington, DC 20520-2818 or fax your letter to 202-736-9132. You may alsocall toll-free at 1-888-407-4747 or by dialing directly at 202-736-9090. You shouldbe notified if a passport application is filed for your child. If you have provided aFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -copy of a court order specifying sole custody to one parent, or restricting the
child’s travel, the passport request by the other parent should be denied. Formore information see the section titled “Prevention Provisions in the Custody
Order” beginning on page 11.
Unless parental rights have been removed, either parent, with or without cus-
tody, can obtain information about his or her minor child’s passport status as partof a passport-restriction request. Certified copies of a child’s passport application,which may contain useful address information, can be obtained from the U.S.Department of State, Passport Services, Research and Liaison Section, 1111 - 19th
Street, Northwest, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036-3617, 202-955-0447.
For more information about children’s passport services visit
www.travel.state.gov. From the home page click on the “Children & Family”
link. Under the “International Parental Child Abduction” heading click onthe “Guarding against & responding to parental child abduction” link. Thenrespectively click on the “Prevention” and “Children’s Passport Issuance AlertProgram” links.
Also contact the embassies and consulates of any foreign countries the abduc-
tor would be likely to visit. Inquire if any applications have been received fromthe abductor for passports, visas, or work permits. If so request the abductor’s
address. Contact information for foreign embassies is available online atwww.embassy.org. From the home page click on the “Embassies” link.
Pet Licenses and Veterinarians
If the abductor took the family pet or is likely to have acquired a pet, check withlocal government agencies that issue licenses for domestic animals to see if theabductor has obtained required licenses. Contact your veterinarian and ask to bealerted if the abductor requests your family pet’s inoculation records. If you can’tget this information, law enforcement may be able to get it. Also check with veteri-
narians in areas where the abductor may have gone. Show pictures of the
abductor, your child, and pet, if possible, and give copies to those who may bewilling to help.
Photograph Dissemination
It is important for parents to have at least one clear recent photograph of theirchild, preferably in color. It should be a close-up of the face with a backgroundthat does not distract from the appearance of the child. A videotape of the childwith a clear, nondistracting background is also helpful.
When a child has been missing a long time, you may want to explore the
possibility of having your child’s photograph “age-enhanced.” Using computertechnology, medical knowledge, and photographs of biological parents or oldersiblings, it is possible to estimate how a child’s features will change with age andproduce an “age-progressed” photograph or illustration. Further informationabout this technique and its availability can be obtained from NCMEC’s MissingChildren Division at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632).
Create a flier or poster  of your missing child with a recent photograph and
complete description including age, hair and eye color, height, weight, birthmarks,grade in school, hobbies, sports, and other key information. Include the tele-
81- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 82phone number of the law-enforcement agency investigating the case, but
obtain the department’s permission first. If a warrant has been issued for theabductor’s arrest, include the warrant number on the flier. You may also want toinclude the abductor’s picture on the poster if there is a criminal warrant. Con-sider offering a reward for information resulting in the child’s safe return. A sample
poster is on page 263.
Check with law enforcement investigating the case before you dissemi-
nate the flier to be sure it will not jeopardize the investigation.  Then send the
flier or poster to the media, schools, and nonprofit organizations located in the
areas you believe your child may be. Check with NCMEC about national dis-semination of your child’s picture. Some nonprofit organizations serving missingand exploited children and their families may be able to help circulate your child’spicture to school systems around the country.
Places of Worship
Check with the abductor’s church, mosque, synagogue, or other place of wor-ship to find out if the abductor has been in contact for any reason. Ask for the
abductor’s current address. Also check with places of worship in the area whereyou think the abductor may be. Find out if the child has been enrolled in reli-gious, school, or youth programs.
Postal Service
Follow your local post office’s procedures to discover the abductor’s forwardingaddress. If the post office has not been notified of an address change, ask if a holdhas been placed on the mail. If so try to find out who is authorized to receive themail. This information may be available to law enforcement only.
Preschools and Daycare
If searching for young children obtain a list of all preschools, licensed daycarecenters, and babysitters and write to them. You may be able to obtain a list oflicensed daycare providers from the jurisdiction’s childcare licensing agency.
Private Investigators
Because most missing children are successfully located through the efforts of pro-fessional law enforcement, NCMEC advises all parents in missing-children casesto work with law enforcement. If, however, you also are considering hiring aprivate investigator to help find your missing child, try to get recommendationsfrom your attorney, missing-children organizations employing private investiga-tors as consultants, other searching parents, and other trusted sources.
Make sure the private investigator has a business license if required by law.
Check with the local office of the attorney general/licensing agency, the betterbusiness bureau, and/or consumer-protection office to help ensure the investigator isreputable. Find out if any complaints have been filed against the investigator.Ask the investigator for references, and check them. Avoid any investigator whopromises to perform a “snatch-back,” as this is disruptive and harmful to theFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 83child and may prejudice your legal case. In some places a “snatch-back” may be
a crime.
It is a good idea to have your lawyer review an investigator’s contract before
you sign it or pay a fee. The contract should set limits for travel, lodging, and per-diem expenses and include protections against unauthorized add-on fees. While
you bear the expense of hiring a private investigator, the court may order the
abductor to repay you reasonable investigative fees and expenses.
Notify all those working on the case, including law enforcement and the pros-
ecutor, if you hire a private investigator. Your private investigator should try notto duplicate law enforcement’s efforts or interfere with the official investigation.
Probation and Parole Officers
If the abductor had been on probation or parole for a prior offense, check withthe local probation and/or parole office to see if the abductor has reported a newaddress. Officers may be willing to provide assistance in locating the abductorespecially if the abductor is in violation of the terms of his or her probation orparole. Addresses of abductors who are convicted sex offenders should be acces-
sible on the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website available at
www.nsopw.gov.
Professional Licenses
If the abductor is in a profession or trade requiring a license, contact licensingboards in places the abductor may be to find out if the abductor has obtaineda license. If so ask for the abductor’s address. If not ask to be alerted in casethe abductor applies for a license. Contact professional associations, such asbar and medical associations, if membership is a prerequisite to practicing in
that jurisdiction.
School Reunions
Contact the abductor’s high school and college for referrals to people in charge of
alumni affairs and class reunions. Contact these people and ask them for anyinformation they have or receive that could help you locate the abductor. Websites
may be helpful along these lines such as www.alumni.net
TM, www.classmates.com®,
and www.reunion.com.
Schools and School Records
Searching parents can write to the state superintendent of schools or secretary of
education to request help in locating their children. Send a photograph or posterof your child with a complete description including age, date of birth, and lastgrade and school attended. Also send a copy of your custody order, and indicatein your cover letter the number of any criminal warrants issued for the abductor.Provide your name and telephone number at home and work. Ask that the child’sphotograph and description be circulated throughout the school system.
If the superintendent is unwilling to circulate your child’s picture, ask for a list
of all the public schools in the state and write to them yourself. Also find out if thesuperintendent maintains information about home-schooled children and, if not,- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 84where to obtain that information. Consider using a fax machine or e-mail to
get your letter and information out quickly.
Send your child’s photograph to private schools as well. The state may maintain
enrollment records for private schools. If not the education commissioner may
have a list of private schools. Obtain this list and send your child’s photograph to
the head of each private school. If your search is focused on a particular location,
or if there is no listing of private schools, contact the superintendent of eachpublic school district for information about private schools operating in that dis-trict. Missing-children organizations and telephone directories may also havethis information.
The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) enables a par-
ent to find out from school officials whether his or her child’s school records havebeen transferred to another school, and, if so, the school to which they have beensent. You can also find out if copies have been sent to the other parent. A parent
can contact the school to which school records were sent and request the child’s
current address and telephone number. If a school is reluctant to disclose thisinformation, explain you are entitled to it under FERPA, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g. Rel-evant parts of the law are reprinted on page 191. Ask school officials not to notify
the other parent of your inquiry. You may use the sample letter on page 267 torequest information regarding your child’s school records.
For more information about FERPA contact the Family Policy Compliance
Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, Southwest, Wash ing-
ton, DC 20202-5920, 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327), www.ed.gov. From the
home page, in the “Search ED.gov” field, type “FERPA.”
Caveat: Although a parent can prevent the transfer of school records by
giving the school a copy of a court order specifically prohibiting the other parent’s
access to them, this could be counterproductive. If a school refuses to transferrecords, an abductor may realize his or her location has been discovered. Thismay prompt the abductor to move the child again to a better hiding place.Instead you can ask the school to notify you if it receives a request for records,and then follow the paper trail to find your child.
Some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring certain government entities,
such as school districts, to “flag” the records of missing children. If the agencyreceives a request for the school transcript of a missing child, the school holdingthe record is to give the name and address of the person requesting the records
to the inves tigating law-enforcement officer. A missing-child clearinghouse or
missing-children organization should be able to provide information about howany such law that exists in your jurisdiction works and which agencies arerequired to participate. These laws usually require government agencies to flagrecords only if they are requested to do so by a law-enforcement agency, whichmay include your missing-child clearinghouse. Many agencies and organizationsnot compelled to do so by law will voluntarily do so if requested by a parent. Ifnecessary you may consider seeking a court order directing agencies and otherentities to flag records regarding your child. Information about your jurisdiction’s
flagging or other such laws can be found in the section titled “Nationwide Direc-
tory of Family-Abduction Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Secretary of State
Contact the appropriate agency in the jurisdictions where the abductor may be
doing business to find out if the abductor has filed any business-related paper-work such as fictitious-name statements or articles of incorporation. If so ask forthe abductor’s contact information.
Skip Traces
Several companies in the United States perform skip traces to locate individuals.These companies usually check many of the resources listed in this chapter, butthey may have access to others not listed or be able to obtain access to recordsinaccessible to you. These companies commonly advertise their services in publi-cations directed to lawyers. Your lawyer may be able to help you contract with a
company for a “skip trace,” or you may check for information in legal publica-
tions that are generally available in law libraries.
Social Security Number
Contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) office in your area to determineif your child has been issued a Social Security card and, if so, where and to whomit was sent. An abductor would need your child’s SSN in order to claim the childas a dependent on tax returns. Also inquire if the child is receiving any SocialSecu rity benefits, and, if so, the address to which they are being sent. Contact
information for Social Security offices is available at www.ssa.gov. From thehome page click on the “Contact Us” link, and then use the links under the“In Person” link.
Team HOPE
This national support network matches trained volunteers who have experiencedan abduction in their family with victim families in order to provide support andassistance. For more information see the description on page 27.
Telephone Directories
Current telephone numbers for the abductor may be found in a variety of ways.Call nationwide information using either 411 or 00 for listings throughout thenation. Look in telephone books, available in most public libraries, or use thenumerous databases available on the Internet, including www.anywho.com,www.555-1212.com
®, www.infobel.com,  www.numberway.com (international
telephone directories), www. reversephonedirectory.com, www.superpages.com®,
www.switchboard®. com, and www.whitepages.comTM. Also search for the
abductor’s name by visiting www.google.com, www.lycos®.com, and
www.yahoo®.com and e ntering the abductor’s name in the “Search“ field.
85- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSETelephone Records
By using a subpoena or search warrant, the prosecutor or your attorney may
be able to obtain copies of the abductor’s telephone records and possibly thetelephone records of the abductor’s relatives and friends who may have infor-mation about the abductor’s whereabouts. Do some research before you seekthese records. Try to identify events that would most likely trigger a call from
or to the abductor such as anniversaries, birthdays, births, and deaths. Re quest
the telephone records for those months. Remember to seek records from all
long-distance and cellular-telephone companies.
Title Searches
Do a title search of the abductor’s real property to find out whether the propertyhas been sold or used as collateral for a loan. The abductor’s current address maybe on file in documents such as the escrow instructions pertaining to the transac-tion. Alternatively it may be available from the escrow company, title company, orsettlement attorney. A title search can be done in a local government office and
also often online. Find the website for the local government where the property is
located, and then search the site index for property records. Property tax bills,
available from local taxing authorities and often online, may also have addressinformation about the abductor.
Try to find out where the proceeds of a sale or mortgage have been sent. If the
proceeds have been sent to a third party, pursue the funds through the thirdparty’s fi nancial records to learn where they were transferred. If you believe
the ab ductor is living in a particular area, conduct a title search of nearby coun-
ties to find out if the abductor has purchased property.
Also check with real-estate agents or apartment leasing companies in places
you think the abductor may be living.
Tracing Calls
Telephone calls can be traced to the telephone from which they were made inseveral ways. You can ask the local telephone company security office to place a“trap” on your telephone or the telephone of the consenting friends or relatives ofthe abductor. A trap is a mechanical device allowing the telephone company totrace calls. It is not an illegal tap or bug of the telephone. The person whose tele-phone line is trapped should keep a notepad next to the telephone and record thedate and time any telephone calls are received from the abductor. The telephonecompany gives trace information to law enforcement.
Another way to activate a trace is by pressing *57 immediately after hanging
up from a call if this service is available in your area. A small fee is charged eachtime the service is activated. Trace information obtained this way is available tolaw enforcement.
In many areas “Caller ID” is available through the telephone company.
Telephone numbers of incoming calls are displayed on a device attached toyour telephone.
86FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Traveler’s Checks
Contact companies selling traveler’s checks such as American Express® and banks
to determine if and where the abductor bought them. Ask to be kept informed of
the dates and places traveler’s checks are cashed.
Underground Organizations
Some parents who flee from perceived abusive family situations with their chil-dren seek protection and assistance from “underground” networks. Some groupsare well organized and can provide airfare, false identities, safe houses, and otherforms of support. Although it may be difficult to penetrate this network, be alertto any signs such groups may be involved. Share this information with the inves-
tigating law-enforcement agency.
Unemployment Compensation and Other Income-Security Programs
Ask state/territorial benefit programs, such as  State Unemployment Compensa-
tion, Worker’s Compensation, Wage-Credit, Aid to Families with Dependent
Chil dren (AFDC or ADC), food stamps, and other welfare programs, to check
the abductor’s name and SSN against their records. Also check the abductor’sname with your child’s SSN. These may be accessible via government websites,
but confidentiality provisions may hinder access to this information. You may,
however, be able to access this information by contacting the security or fraudsections of these agencies. If you still cannot obtain this information directly fromthe program, consider seeking a court order. Alternatively a law-enforce-
ment of ficer investigating the case may be able to obtain it, or an “authorized
person” may be able to obtain this information by requesting an FPLS search.
Note:  If the abductor has lodged a report of domestic violence or child abuse
against you with these agencies, laws may prohibit release of address informationto you.
Union Records
Check with the abductor’s union for current address information, and ask to benotified if the abductor contacts the union to pay dues, request job-related assis-tance, or for other services. Check back periodically especially around the timedues would normally be paid. Contact union locals in places the abductor maybe. You can find information about national union offices in the Encyclopedia of
Associations, which is available at most libraries.
Utility Companies
Once you have narrowed your search to a particular area, cable, electric, gas,satellite dish, and telephone companies may be willing to tell you if a new accounthas been opened in the abductor’s name. Law-enforcement investigators may beable to obtain this information if you cannot. Also check with the utility companyserving the abductor’s former residence to find out what arrangements have beenmade to return the abductor’s deposit or forward bills.
87- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 88Vehicle Rentals
Check with area vehicle rental agencies to determine if the abductor has rented a
vehicle and, if so, when and where it was returned.
Veterans
If there is a possibility the abductor may be receiving benefits or medical treat-ment through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), check with the VAfor the abductor’s current address. Also try to get information about VA facilitiesthe abductor has recently visited, and check with them for address information.The VA Web address is www.va.gov.
If the abductor is a veteran but cannot be located through the military
locator services listed beginning on page 77 try contacting military organiza-tions such as the American Legion at www.legion.org or Veterans of ForeignWars at www.vfw.org.
Voter Registration
Check voter registration records in jurisdictions where the abductor is likely tohave established residences. These records may be kept by local agencies.
Website
Create a website for your child. Use your child’s name in the Web address, andinclude an e-mail address, for example, www.johndoe.com or janedoe@aol.com.A computer-savvy child may do an Internet search for his or her own name, findthe site, and make contact with you via the Internet. Remove all of these websitesand e-mail addresses when your child is located.
Your child may frequent social networking websites on the Internet such as
MySpace at www.myspace.com and Facebook at www.facebook.com. Ask yourchild’s friends to alert you if they communicate with your child online.
Western Union®®®®®
Check with Western Union to see if money has been wired to the abductor. If so askwho sent it and where it was sent. Their website address is www.westernunion
®.com.
Women’s Shelters
A parent who flees from a perceived abusive family situation may go to a shelter forprotection. Women’s shelters keep information about their residents strictly confi-dential. It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to get information from the shelter.
Pursue All Legal Means Available
This chapter has described many sources of information that may prove to be
helpful in finding an abducted child. The searching parent should work with his
or her attorney, the prosecutor, and the investigating officer as informa tion and
leads are developed. If ever in doubt about the legality of a particular method,
check with these professionals first.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -89Checklist of Information Sources

91- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Recovering Your Child
by Patricia M. Hoff
Chapter Overview
This chapter covers legal methods of child recovery in the United States after an
abduction. The applicable laws and procedures are discussed including theParental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), Uniform Child Custody Jurisdic-tion and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act(UCCJA), Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child
Abduction (Hague Convention), and International Child Abduction Remedies
Act (ICARA). The role of prosecutors and law en forcement in civil-custody
enforcement cases is also described. Methods for recovering children abducted
to or kept in other countries is covered in the chapter titled “International ChildAbduction” beginning on page 105. Psychological issues in recovery and familyreunification are discussed in the chapter beginning on page 127. Below is a sum-
mary of the key points  more fully discussed in this chapter.
1. Abductors looking for a way out of an abduction can contact Child Find
® of
America, at 1-800-A-WAY-OUT (1-800-292-9688). Mediation services are pro-vided to help resolve family-abduction cases.
2. Left-behind parents can contact law enforcement to see if they can help with
a recovery. Also check with prosecutors if you, or your child, is in a state thathas adopted the UCCJEA. Depending on the version of the law in ef fect,
prosecutors and law enforcement acting at their request may have civil statu-
tory authority to assist in locating and recovering children.
3. Make sure you have at least one, and preferably three, certified copies of your
custody order to give to authorities.
4. Consider registering or filing your custody order in the jurisdiction where
your child is located. Law enforcement may require you to do this before they
will help.
5. You may have to bring a civil-enforcement action in a court in the juris dic-
tion where your child is located. The PKPA requires state courts to en force
and not modify custody decrees made consistently with its terms. TheUCCJEA and UCCJA also require interstate enforcement. Ask the court toorder your child’s return, direct law enforcement to accompany and assistyou in enforcing the order, and order the abductor to pay your attorney’sfees and other expenses.
6. In international wrongful removal and retention cases, the Hague Conven-
tion may be available to secure a child’s prompt return. A federal statute,ICARA, provides the procedures for using the Hague Convention in this country.
FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 93Recovering 
Your Child- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  7. If there is a risk the abductor will flee with the child upon receipt of notice of
an enforcement action, you and, in some states, prosecutors or law enforce-
ment can ask the court to issue a pick-up order for your child. Then lawenforcement picks up the child and serves the abductor with notice of theenforcement hearing, which occurs soon thereafter.
  8. If you need help with transportation, contact the National Center for Missing
& Exploited Children
® (NCMEC) at 1-800-THE-LOST® (1-800-843-5678) to
see if you are eligible for travel assistance.
  9. If you cannot be present to pick-up your child, make alternate arrangements
in advance.
10. Self-help recovery may be allowed in a particular place, but if there is
any doubt, do not risk it . You may be criminally charged and subject
to extradition even if you have a custody order entitled under the PKPAto enforcement.
11. Seek appropriate prevention measures to avoid a reabduction.
12. Familiarize yourself with the psychological issues involved in child recovery
and family reunification.
94 - F AMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSERecovering 
Your ChildFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Do you have a child-custody determination?  In almost every case you will need
one to recover your child. If you do not have a child-custody determination, you
should promptly obtain one. See the chapter titled “Civil-Court Remedies If Your
Child Is Abducted” beginning on page 23. A decree awarding you temporarycustody can be enforced in the same way as a decree awarding you permanent
custody. Provisions in the order, stating the basis of jurisdiction and how notice
and opportunity to be heard were given to the abductor, can simplify enforce-
ment by putting the enforcing court on notice that the order is valid andenforceable unless proved otherwise.
Don’t do anything illegal! This could hurt your chances of recovering your
child. For instance do not break into the noncustodial parent’s home and snatchyour child back. Instead of going safely home with your child, you could findyourself facing a number of criminal charges including disturbing the peace, bur-glary, assault and battery.
Voluntary Return
Child Find® of America, a national, nonprofit organization, offers professional
mediation services, via telephone, to parents who have abducted their ownchildren and are seeking “a way out.” Services are free and confidential. Pro
bono  mediators offer a parent the opportunity to work out differences with
the other parent. They also act as a go-between for the abductor and left-
behind parent in an effort to return the child. Once both parents agree to
mediate and sign a commitment to do so, a professional mediator is assignedand the process begins using the toll-free telephone number 1-800-A-WAY-OUT (1-800-292-9688). Child Find has found telephone mediation may beeffective when face-to-face mediation is impractical. For more informationvisit www.childfind
®ofamerica.org. From the home page click on the “Pro-
grams” link, and read the “CAPSS” section. This acronym stands for ChildFind’s Child Abduction Prevention and Support Services.
If warrants are outstanding, court and law-enforcement officials are
informed of the mediation, goals of the program, and name and address of
the mediator. Child Find has found courts and law-enforcement agencies gen-
erally let parents work things out themselves through the mediation process.
You do not need a custody decree to negotiate with the child’s abductor, but it
will improve your bargaining position. In addition the order will provide the frame-work for custody and visitation rights once your child is back with you. If you donot have a custody order going into mediation, you will need one afterwardssetting forth the agreement you reach. You should not rely on an oral or writtenagreement with the abductor.
Public Enforcement: Help fromLaw Enforcement and Prosecutors
In states that have enacted sections 315-317 of the UCCJEA, prosecutors, or otherdesignated public officials, and law enforcement acting at their request can playan important part in the civil-recovery process. The law gives them civil statutoryauthority to take any lawful action to locate a child, obtain the child’s return, and
95- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEenforce a child-custody determination when there is an existing cust ody deter-
mination, a request from a court in a pending child-custody pro ceeding,
or a reasonable belief a crime has been committed or violation of the Hague
Convention has occurred.
Check the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws
and Resources,” beginning on page 199, to see if these UCCJEA public-enforce-ment provisions are in effect in the state where your child is located and recoverywill occur. Note: The section numbers may differ among states and territories. If
“UCCJA” is listed as the law in your jurisdiction, check the code in that jurisdic-tion because the UCCJEA may have been passed after this guide was published.If the public-enforcement provisions are in effect, contact the prosecutor whereyour child is located and ask for recovery help. Go through the same steps to findout if prosecutors or other designated officials in your jurisdiction can helprecover your child from another jurisdiction.
Don’t be surprised if the prosecutor is unfamiliar with this relatively new law.
Bring this guide with you and show the prosecutor the key points of theUCCJEA as reprinted on page 159. Be prepared to make a strong case fortheir intervention. Y ou also need to know prosecutors are not required to act. As
in criminal matters prosecutors have discretion to decide whether or not to takeaction. If the prosecutor acts pursuant to the UCCJEA, the actions are taken onbehalf of the court. Although you may be the beneficiary, the prosecutor is notacting as your private lawyer.
Check with local law enforcement to see if they can help recover your child.
Missing-children and child-custody statutes may direct law enforcement to takeabducted or missing children into protective custody in certain circumstances.The law in some jurisdictions directs law enforcement to return a child to thelawful custodian when the abductor is arrested. While the laws in most jurisdic-tions do not require this, in some places law-enforcement officers may return anabducted child to the lawful custodian upon proof of custody as long as the lawdoes not prohibit it. Generally speaking law enforcement will require a custodialparent to furnish at least one certified copy of the custody decree and properidentification. Check with law enforcement in the enforcing jurisdiction for local
requirements. Law enforcement may also have you register or file your custody
order with the local court in that jurisdiction before they act. These proceduresare described below. It is also a good idea to have a copy of your child’s birthcertificate and photograph of you with the child. Normally the custodial parentmust actually be present in the jurisdiction when law enforcement picks up a child,although it may be possible to make alternate arrangements as discussed below.
Many law-enforcement officers are hesitant to pick-up a child or accompany
a parent to recover a child without an order from a court of their jurisdiction orspecific statutory authority. Determining the validity of the custody order can
be difficult, and the potential for civil liability exists if the order is later deter-mined to be invalid.
Filing and Registering Custody Orders From Other States
UCCJA Filing
If the enforcement of a child-custody determination is sought in one of the fewstates still having the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, Section 15 of that
96FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Act allows you to file a certified copy of a custody determination in the office of
the clerk of the designated court. This procedure is commonly called “filing.”Filing is not mandatory, but there are good reasons for doing so. Once filed thecustody determination is treated as if it were an order made by the courts in thestate in which it was filed and can be enforced by whatever methods a local order
can be enforced. As discussed above some law-enforcement agencies will recover
a child once another jurisdiction’s order is filed with the local court; however,others require a local court order. Filing also puts courts on notice of the sisterstate custody order, which alerts the court to the possibility of continuing juris-diction in the issuing court. In theory this should prevent a court from exercisingjurisdiction in a custody action brought by the abductor.
A lawyer can file your custody order for you, or you can do it yourself. Send a
certified or properly authenticated copy of your custody order, and applicablefiling fees, to the clerk of the court in the jurisdiction where your child is located.
Call the clerk of the court first to find out what documents and fees to send. In
your cover letter indicate you are filing the custody order pursuant to the UCCJA.
UCCJEA Registration
The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act creates a processallowing, but not requiring, parents and other parties to register their child-custody and visitation determinations with courts in other states. Once an orderis registered, it is enforceable as of the date of registration in the same manner asa local custody determination. Subsequently filed enforcement proceedings should
be fast and predictable because only limited defenses are available.
How do you register an order?  The registration process is designed so a parent
can at least start without an attorney; however, a parent may need to involve a
lawyer if the abductor challenges registration. A request for registration is sent to
the court along with copies of the custody order and other information requiredin the law. The court then files the order as a foreign judgment and serves noticeon any parent or person acting as a parent who has been awarded custody orvisitation. Those served notice have 20 days from when they were servedto request a hearing to contest registration. If no such request is made, the
order is con firmed as a matter of law.
Only three defenses are available to a person who requests a hearing to chal-
lenge registration. They are lack of jurisdiction in the decree court; lack of notice
and opportunity to be heard in the custody proceedings resulting in the order;and the child-custody determination has been vacated, stayed, or modified. Oncea registered order is confirmed, whether by operation of law or after a hearing,the only defense allowed in a later enforcement action is that the custody deter-
mination has been vacated, stayed, or modified.
Going to Court to Enforce Your Custody Order
Duty to Enforce
If law enforcement and the prosecutor cannot or will not help you recover your
child and voluntary return is out of the question, you will have to bring a civilaction to enforce the custody determination in a court in the jurisdiction where
97- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEyour child is located. The UCCJA or UCCJEA, whichever is in effect in the
enforcement state, and the federal PKPA require state courts to enforce andnot modify sister state custody determinations made consistently with theirprovisions. Custodial and noncustodial parents can use these statutes to en force
their respective custody and visitation rights. If a custodial parent interferes
with a noncustodial parent’s visitation rights, a noncustodial parent has re course
to the courts to enforce visitation rights under the same laws governing
custody enforcement.
Generally speaking the PKPA will be cited in the enforcement petition as the
legal grounds for enforcement. This is because the PKPA requires jurisdictionsto give “full faith and credit” to custody determinations made in compliance withits terms. The relevant state law grounds will also be cited.
If there is a conflict between the provisions of the PKPA and applicable state
law such as  the UCCJA or UCCJEA, the PKPA, as a federal law, takes precedence.
This is called “federal preemption.” This is an important principle, particularly instates continuing to follow the UCCJA because there are a few important differ-ences between the UCCJA and PKPA that may affect the enforceability of certainUCCJA custody orders. It is possible an order made under the UCCJA may notbe entitled to “full faith and credit” under the PKPA, and a court exercising juris-diction under the UCCJA may be required by the PKPA to enforce another court’sorder even if it has already issued its own. The UCCJEA, on the other hand, waswritten to be consistent with the PKPA, and conflicts between the two laws aremuch less likely to occur. As a general rule custody determinations made by
courts applying the UCCJEA will be entitled to “full faith and credit” under the
PKPA as well as enforceable under the state law.
In addition to asking the court to enforce your order and return your child to
you, you may ask the judge to include an instruction in the order directing lawenforcement to “accompany and assist” you in recovering your child. You mayalso ask for attorney’s fees and other expenses as discussed on page 101.
It is important to understand enforcement hearings under all three statutes –
the UCCJA, UCCJEA, and PKPA – are narrow in scope and should not reopen theunderlying custody case.
Enforcing Foreign Custody Determinations in the United States
Custody decrees made by courts in other countries may be enforced in this coun-try under the UCCJA or UCCJEA. Section 23 of the UCCJA  requires state courts
to enforce foreign custody decrees if notice and opportunity to be heard weregiven to all affected persons. The UCCJA also extends its general policies to theinternational area.
Section 105 of the UCCJEA  requires state courts to recognize and enforce
custody determinations made by foreign courts under factual circumstances insubstantial conformity with the standards of the UCCJEA. The UCCJEA alsorequires courts to treat foreign courts as if they were domestic courts for pur-poses of determining jurisdiction to make or modify a custody determination.Courts are not required to apply the UCCJEA if the child-custody laws of the
foreign country violate fundamental principles of human rights. A parentopposing enforcement could raise this as a defense.
98FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -The PKPA’s duty to enforce sister state orders does not extend to custody
determinations made by courts in other countries. Thus enforcement of foreign
custody orders would be pursued under either the UCCJA or UCCJEA.
Parents in the United States seeking return of their children from other coun-
tries must rely on foreign law, which may include the Hague Convention
discussed immediately below. The chapter titled “International Child Abduc-
tion,” beginning on page 105, explains remedies available when children arewrongfully removed from the United States or kept in other countries.
Recovery Under the Hague Convention
When There Is No Custody Determination to Enforce
The UCCJA and UCCJEA provide for recognition and enforcement of foreign
custody determinations in the United States. Parents of children abducted to thiscountry may use the UCCJA or UCCJEA to enforce foreign, child-custody ordersand secure return of their children. They may also have the option of using theHague Convention if it is in effect between the United States and the other coun-
try. A lawyer’s advice can be helpful in deciding the best way to proceed.
Quite often children are abducted before custody has been determined or
“pre-decree.” If there is no custody determination to enforce, the UCCJA and
UCCJEA enforcement remedies are not available. The Hague Convention rem-edy fills the gap because it applies to pre-decree, international wrongful removaland retention cases. This is consistent with the Hague Convention goal of promptlyrestoring abducted children to their pre-abduction circumstances so courts intheir home countries can decide custody.
A Hague Convention proceeding is not a traditional enforcement action where
a court is asked to enforce a custody determination. Rather a court must decide ifa child’s removal or retention is wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Con-vention. If it is, the child’s prompt return must be ordered. Only a few exceptionsto the return obligation are available. Procedures for invoking the HagueConvention remedy in the United States are found in the International ChildAbduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11601, et seq. ICARA is reprinted begin-
ning on page 173. The chapter titled “International Child Abduction,”beginning on page 105, has a more thorough description of this HagueConvention remedy.
Enforcement Procedures
The PKPA mandates enforcement of custody orders but leaves enforcement pro-cedures up to state laws. Follow the procedures in the jurisdiction in which youseek enforcement.
Enforcement procedures vary in UCCJA  states, and include writs of
habeas corpus, contempt proceedings, and petitions for enforcement. Checkwith the clerk of the court in the enforcement state, or consult your lawyer,for information about appropriate enforcement procedures.
In UCCJEA states, streamlined procedures are available for prompt enforce-
ment of custody and visitation. In addition to the public-enforcement pro visions
described above, and the “warrant to take physical custody of child” provi-sion discussed under “Pick-Up Orders” on page 102, the UCCJEA provides fortemporary visitation and expedited “next day” enforcement.
99- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSETemporary Visitation  The UCCJEA allows a court to issue a temporary order to
enforce visitation rights. Depending on the case, the court may order a specific
visitation schedule for instance to clarify the terms “reasonable visitation” or “make-up visitation.” Permanent changes in the order must be made by the court withexclusive continuing modification jurisdiction.
Expedited Enforcement  The UCCJEA provides for an enforcement hearing, nor-
mally on the next court day after service, or the first judicial day possible, whichwill result in an order allowing the petitioner to take immediate physical custodyof a child unless the respondent establishes a defense. If the order has previouslybeen registered, then only one defense is available – that the order has been
vacated, stayed, or modified since being registered. If the order has not been
registered, two other defenses are also available. They are the issuing court lackedjurisdiction and lack of notice and opportunity to be heard in the underlyingcustody proceeding.
When you must pursue enforcement in a distant location, be prepared to
attend the hearing so you are present to recover your child. Your lawyer canadvise you when your presence is needed. This is not always possible, and alter-nate arrangements may be needed. These are discussed in the section titled“Temporary Care for a Child” on page 103.
Hiring a Lawyer in the Enforcement State
You should seriously consider hiring a lawyer in the jurisdiction where yourchild is lo cated to help enforce your custody decree. Experienced counsel may be
crucial in getting your child back. Your original lawyer may be able to representyou if he or she has a law license in the second state or obtains permission toappear on your behalf from a court in that jurisdiction. The advantage to using
your original lawyer in the enforcement action is his or her familiarity with the
case. The drawback is your lawyer may be unfamiliar with practices and proce-dures in the second state, and an error or oversight on your lawyer’s part couldlead the judge to rule against your enforcement request. Therefore you shouldconsider hiring a lawyer in the state in which your child is located – either tohandle the case or assist your original lawyer as co-counsel. Your original lawyermay be able to recommend a lawyer in the second state. Other sources of lawyerreferrals can be found in the section titled “Finding a Knowledgeable Lawyer”beginning on page 27.
Can You Go to Federal Court to Resolve
Interstate Child-Custody-Jurisdiction Disputes?
No. Under existing law federal courts cannot act as “tie breakers” when courts in
different states have issued conflicting custody determinations. This is the hold-ing of a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court case, Thompson  v. Thompson, 484 U.S. 174
(1988). Unless the U.S. Congress enacts a law giving a custody contestant theright to go to federal court for a determination of which state court has jurisdic-tion consistent with the PKPA to make custody and visitation orders, the federalcourts will not intervene. In the meantime conflicting custody decisions can be
100FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -appealed through the court systems of the states that made them with hopes of
eventually resolving the conflict. This, of course, is not always possible.
In response to the Thompson  decision the American Bar Association adopted a
resolution supporting federal legislation to allow custody litigants to go to federalcourt to resolve jurisdictional disputes between state courts in child-custody and
visitation cases. Basically this would allow federal courts to act as tiebreakers
when state courts in different states issue conflicting custody orders about thesame child. Because it would change the effect of the Thompson case, the proposal
is called “ Thompson  legislation .” To date Thompson  legislation has not been
enacted. Interested individuals can contact their Congressional delegations.
Attorney’s Fees and Other Expenses
In your enforcement pleadings you can ask the court to award you attorney’s feesand other expenses you incurred trying to locate and recover your child. Cite theapplicable statutory section. Uniform Act citations are provided below. Consultyour state law for the corresponding citation.
Under UCCJA  § 15(b) courts may order the party who violated a custody
decree to pay the necessary travel; witness; and other expenses, includingattorney’s fees, incurred by the party who brought the en forcement action and
is entitled to custody.
Under UCCJEA  § 312 courts must award necessary and reasonable
expenses to parties who prevail in enforcement actions unless the party whowould be re quired to pay establishes such an award would be clearly inappropri-
ate. Necessary and reasonable expenses include costs, communication expenses,attorney’s fees, investigative fees, witness expenses, travel expenses, and childcareduring the course of the proceeding.
Section 8(c) of Pub. L. No. 96-611, part of the PKPA , encourages, but does
not require, courts to award necessary travel expenses, attorneys’ fees, costs ofprivate investigations, witness fees or expenses, and other expenses incurred inconnection with an enforcement action, to the person entitled to custody or visi-tation pursuant to the order.
The International Child Abduction Remedies Act  is the federal statute
imple menting the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International
Child Abduction in the United States. Under ICARA, 42 U.S.C. § 11607, uponordering re turn of a child under this Hague Convention, courts are required to
order the wrongdoer to pay the left-behind parent’s necessary expenses unlessthe wrongdoer can show such an order is clearly inappropriate. Expenses includecourt costs, legal fees, foster home or other care during the proceeding, and trans-portation costs related to the child’s return.
Note:  The UCCJEA also provides for an award of fees and expenses when a
court declines to exercise jurisdiction because the petitioner has engaged inunjustifiable conduct. Under UCCJEA § 208(c) when a court dismisses a petitionor stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant tosubsection 208(a), it shall assess against the party seeking to invoke jurisdictionnecessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses,attorney’s fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child-care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees aresought establishes that assessment would be clearly inappropriate.
101TROUBLE
SHOOTING- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEAnticipating Risks Associated With Enforcement Actions
Parents seeking enforcement of custody orders can take steps to minimize the
risk of flight by the abductor and prevent modification by the enforcement court.
Pick-Up Orders  There may be a risk to using the legal system to enforce a custody
order if an abductor is likely to flee with or endanger the child upon receivingnotice of the enforcement proceeding. As a precaution you can petition a judge,usually in the jurisdiction in which your child is located, for a pick-up orderdirecting law-enforcement officers to pick-up the abducted child for temporary
placement, often with the left-behind parent, until the enforcement hearing. A
pick-up order may be called a warrant to take physical custody of child , writ of
habeas corpus , writ of enforcement , writ of attachment , or warrant in lieu of a writ of
habeas corpus , among other terms.
Section 311 of the UCCJEA authorizes a court to issue a warrant to take
physical custody of child  upon a finding “the child is imminently likely to suf-
fer serious physical harm or be removed from the State.” The UCCJA has noexplicit provision for pick-up orders; however, most jurisdictions will allow youto obtain an ex parte , pick-up order for law enforcement to pick-up your child
if you can show convincing evi dence the abductor is likely to flee with your
child prior to trial. Examples include prior abductions; threats of abduction; andevidence the abductor has quit a job, sold a home, terminated a lease, or closed abank account. Other abduction risk factors are listed in the chapter titled
“Preventing Abductions” be ginning on page 9.
Ex parte  orders are orders obtained without notice to the other parent. They
are always of short duration and followed by a hearing in the issuing court. Lawenforcement usually serves the abductor with notice of the enforcement hearingwhen the child is picked up.
Warrants  To get a “warrant to take physical custody of a child” in a UCCJEA state
the person seeking the warrant files a verified application for the warrant alongwith a petition seeking enforcement of a child-custody determination. The courtmust take testimony from the petitioner or other witness. This can be in person,via telephone, or by any means allowed by local law. If the court finds the child is
imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from the state,
the court may issue a warrant directing law-enforcement officers to pick-up thechild and providing for the child’s placement pending the enforcement hearing.The respondent must be immediately served with the enforcement petition afterthe child is taken into physical custody. The hearing on the enforcement petitionmust be on the next judicial day after the warrant is executed unless such timingis impossible.
Restrictions on Modifying the Custody Order Another risk associated with enforce-
ment actions is the possibility the abductor will ask a judge to modify or changethe custody order; however, an enforcing court does not automatically havejurisdiction to modify. The PKPA gives the decree court exclusive continuingjurisdiction if the original exercise of jurisdiction complied with the PKPA, atleast one contestant remains in the state, and there is any basis under state law forcustody jurisdiction. If the decree court has exclusive continuing jurisdiction thatit has not declined, then the enforcing court is prohibited from modifying the
102FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -103order. This is true even if the enforcement state has become the child’s new home
state, which is frequently the case. The UCCJEA has a similar provision.
If the decree state has exclusive continuing jurisdiction, the left-behind parent’s
remedy is to file a motion to dismiss the abductor’s modification petition or local
equivalent of that procedure. This may slow things down, but it should not affect
the outcome of the enforcement action.
Temporary Care for a Child
The recovering parent should try to be present to pick-up his or her child. If this
is not possible, you may be able to designate a relative or other adult to taketemporary care of your child. Consult in advance with law enforcement, the pros-ecutor, your lawyer, or the judge issuing the pick-up or enforcement order. Amissing-child clearinghouse or missing-children organization in that area may be
familiar with local practice.
You may be able to have the local child-protective-services agency take tem-
porary custody of your child, if the law in that jurisdiction permits. The role you
are asking the child-protective-services agency to play is to transport and tempo-rarily house your child after he or she is recovered. If you must seek the assistanceof the child-protective-services agency, thoroughly discuss your situation
in advance, as local social workers may be unfamiliar with parental kidnap-ping. More typically they arrange care and protection for abandoned, abused,or neglected children. Be sure you will be al lowed to regain custody of your
child without legal complications.
Check the telephone directory under “County Government” for the local
child-protective-services agency. You can also call the family court for a refer-ral to this agency.
A missing-child clearinghouse or missing-children organization in the area in
which your child is located may be able to help with suggestions for other place-ment alternatives. Some parents have obtained assistance through religiousinsti tutions in their area or the community in which their children are located.
Transporting Your Child Home
Some companies, such as American Airlines®; Amtrak®; Continental Airlines,
Inc.®, and the Greyhound® Bus Lines, have programs providing assistance to
parents who must travel to recover their missing children. Contact NCMEC
at 1-800-THE-LOST® (1-800-843-5678) to determine if you are eligible for as sis-
tance from one of these programs.
Special Enforcement Problems If the Abductor
Is In the Military and Stationed in Another Country
When a member of the military on active duty takes a child to a duty stationin another country, special enforcement problems can arise. These are dis-cussed in the chapter titled “International Child Abduction” beginning onpage 105 particularly in the section titled “Recovering Children Who Are Vic-tims of International Abduction” beginning on page 121.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 104Self-Help Recovery: Is It Advisable?
In some places once you have filed or registered your custody decree, you may be
allowed to go and get your child as long as you do not commit any criminal acts,such as disturbing the peace or breaking and entering, in the process. Check witha lawyer, law enforcement, or a local prosecutor to see if self-help recovery is legalwhere you intend to do it. Even if the answer is yes it is still a good idea to ask law
enforcement to accompany you when you pick-up your child.
If there is any doubt about the legality of self-help recovery and if the pros-
ecutor or other public official designated by the UCCJEA or law enforcement
does not provide assistance with child recovery, you should file a petition withthe local court to enforce your custody decree. When the judge rules in yourfavor, he or she can issue an order directing the abductor to return your child toyou. The order can also direct law enforcement to accompany and assist you inthe recovery.
Apart from public authorities playing a role in child recovery pursuant to the
UCCJEA, bringing an action to enforce a custody determination is clearly thesafest means of child recovery in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision inCalifornia v. Superior Court of California, San Bernardino County (Smolin, et al.) ,
484 U.S. 400, 107 S. Ct. 2433 (1987). In the Smolin case a California father went to
Louisiana where, acting pursuant to a California custody determination, herecovered his children and returned with them to California. Notwithstandingthe California custody determination, Louisiana charged him with simplekidnapping and sought his extradition from California. He challenged extra-
dition. The case went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held the
father was subject to extradition to stand trial in Louisiana on the criminal chargeseven though the California custody order appeared to be consistent with the
PKPA and thus en titled to “full faith and credit” in Louisiana. The place where
the father needed to prove his defenses to the criminal charge was Louisiana, notCalifornia. The Smolin  case underscores the potential pitfalls of self-help, child
recovery even when you have a valid custody order.
Post-Recovery Prevention Measures
Talk to your lawyer about going back to court to ask a judge to incorporate pre-vention provisions into the custody order. You may be able to do this before yourchild is returned, but, more likely, you will do this after your child is home.

by Patricia M. Hoff
Chapter Overview
The information in this chapter is intended to help a parent in the United States organize a com-
prehensive response to an actual or threatened international abduction. The primary focus ison “out going cases,” those involving children who are wrongfully removed from the United States
and taken to or wrong fully retained in a foreign country. “Incoming cases,” those involving
children who are wrongfully removed from other countries and taken to or wrongfullyretained in the United States, receive a more abbreviated treatment.
Much of the information a parent needs during an international-abduction case is discussed in
the first six chapters of this guide. This chapter supplements those materials.
Assistance is available in international-abduction cases from various sources, which are sum-
marized below and more fully discussed in this chapter. In some in stances parents can request
help directly. In other cases, as noted below, assistance is available only at the request of law enforce-ment or prosecutors. Parents may wish to share this list with local law enforcement and prosecutorsworking on their case.1.Local law enforcement and the prosecutor.  Parents report missing children to local law
enforcement, who take missing-person reports and enter the child’s description in the FederalBureau of Investigation’s (FBI) National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. America’sMissing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alerts may be issued in urgent, high-risk
cases. Local prosecutors may criminally charge the abductor under state laws and seek an
Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP) warrant.

Child AbductionFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -The Problem
If you are a parent of a child abducted from the United States, regrettably you
are not alone. Since the late 1970s the Office of Overseas Citizens Services in theU.S. Department of State has taken action in several thousand cases of interna-tional parental child abduction including wrongful removals of children andwrongful retentions after court-ordered visitation.

While each family’s experience is unique, a parent may be able to learn from
another’s experience, particularly when a child is abducted to the same country.OJJDP supported establishment of Team HOPE, a network matching trained vol-unteers who have experienced an abduction with other victim families in order
to provide support and assistance. To be matched with a volunteer call toll-
free at 1- 866-305-HOPE (1-866-305-4673).
Many cases reported to the U.S. Department of State in volve a parent who
was born or raised in a foreign country or who has close family, business, or
religious ties to a foreign country. Foreign parents who have assimilated into U.S.culture as adults may feel their children should be raised as they were. There
may be sharp religious or cultural conflicts between the two parents.
Children born to a foreign parent may have dual citizenship. In addition to
being a citizen of the United States they may also have the citizenship of theforeign parent. This may be true even if the foreign parent has become a natural-
ized citizen of the United States. As a result foreign governments may help
foreign parents obtain passports and other visa and exit/entry permits fortheir children.
A significant minority of international child-abduction cases, however, involve
a child born to two parents who are citizens of the United States. In those casesthe abducting parent relies on the fact it will be more difficult for the searchingparent to find the abductor and child once in another country and enforce a U.S.custody order in a foreign court.
Overview of the Legal Responseto International Child Abduction
As in domestic, family-abduction cases, the civil- and criminal-justice systemsserve different purposes in international-abduction cases. The government usescriminal processes such as criminal charges, investigations, extradition, prosecu-tion, and punishment to hold the abductor responsible for criminal parentalkidnapping. A parent uses civil remedies to seek an abducted child’s return.
Depending on the facts a parent may be criminally charged under state law
or federal law such as the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act. If chargedunder state law the prosecutor may apply for a federal UFAP warrant if theabductor has fled the country to avoid prosecution. Extradition may be soughtfor state and federal crimes.
Criminal charges are aimed at the wrongdoer and do not address child recov-
ery. Although a child may be located in the course of a criminal investigation
10714“Abduction Prevention.” Washington, DC: U.S. Department of State. Accessed March 14, 2008, at
www.travel.state.gov/pdf/abduction_prevention_overview.pdf.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEdirected at the abductor and recovered incidental to the criminal process, parents
cannot rely on the criminal process for a child’s return. Ordinarily a parent mustsimultaneously pursue civil means to locate and recover a child even if a prosecu-tor is pursuing the abductor’s extradition and prosecution.
When children are wrongfully removed to or retained in countries that are
U.S. Hague Convention treaty partners, a parent may use the Hague Convention’sadministrative and legal remedies to seek the child’s return. The Hague Conven-tion may also be used to promote enjoyment of access rights, although the
remedy does not include return of the child. A detailed description of theHague Convention ap pears beginning on page 113.
Abduction cases to non-Hague Convention countries remain the most diffi-
cult to resolve. Parents generally hire lawyers in the foreign country to bring legalproceedings in the foreign country under the law of that country, either toenforce a U.S. custody order or get a new order. Foreign courts do not automati-
cally honor custody orders made by judges in the United States or other countries.
Parents whose children have been abducted to or wrongfully retained in
the United States may use the Hague Convention and federal implementing
statute, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, to seek a child’s re turn
from this country or access to the child. This entails filing a lawsuit in a stateor federal court. Alternatively parents can file civil lawsuits in state courts toenforce foreign custody and visitation determinations. The UCCJA andUCCJEA both provide for enforcement of foreign custody orders meetingspecified standards.

national parental kidnapping is available at www.ncjrs.gov. From the home page,in the “Site Search” field, enter “NCJ 189382.”

Judicial Safeguards and Practical Prevention Measures
The chapter titled “Preventing Abductions,” beginning on page 9, covers
prevention strategies in  family-abduction cases and should be read by anyone
concerned about a possible international abduction. The information about flag-ging and preventing issuance of passports previously discussed on page 18 isrepeated below.
By way of summary a parent can ask the court to include a variety of provi-
sions in the custody order, alone or in combination, to limit the risk of a child’s
removal from the United States. Prevention provisions include, but are not lim-ited to, prohibitions on visitation beyond a specified geographical area;restrictions on removing a child from the United States; restrictions on applyingfor a new or replacement passport for the child; temporary suspension of visi-
tation or su pervised visitation; surrender of passports and other travel documents
prior to visits; substantial bonds; notification to the foreign embassy or consulate
110FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -111of the situation and request not to issue travel documents for the child and to
be informed if application is made; specific definition of terms in the custody
order to facilitate use of the Hague Convention; and a clear statement of the child’sresidential arrangements.
If an order allows visitation in another country, visits may be conditioned on a
substantial bond; purchase of roundtrip airline tickets for the child and custodialparent in case the child is not returned; entry of a foreign court order, sometimesreferred to as a mirror-image order, confirming the provisions of the U.S. orderand agreeing to return the child if the order is violated; and the provision to the
custodial parent of the names, ad dresses, and telephone numbers of all relatives
living in the country where visits are to occur.
In July 2006 the Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act (UCAPA) was
approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Lawsand recommended for enactment in all states. UCAPA identifies risk factors for
child abduction and prevention measures courts can include in custody and visi-
tation orders to reduce the risk of abduction. Parents and lawyers interested inchild-abduction prevention should read UCAPA even if it is not enacted in yourstate. It is a useful tool to educate courts about the problem and possiblesolutions. UCAPA can be found at www.nccusl.org. From the home page clickon the “Final Acts & Legislation” link. Then from the “Select an Act Title”field select “Child Abduction Prevention” and click on the “Search” button.This Act is also reprinted beginning on page 191.
Practical things a parent can do to prevent an international abduction include
working with international, missing-children organizations; keeping records ofthe other parent’s passport numbers, immigration status, visa and work-permitnumbers; avoiding joint-custody orders when family members are dual nation-als; considering custody mediation or collaborative law negotiation as a wayto refocus both parents’ attention on what is best for the child  in order to
develop a workable cross-cultural, child-rearing plan; and flagging and prevent-ing issuance of passports.
Flagging Child’s U.S. Passport Application
You can learn from the U.S. Department of State’s Office of Children’s Issueswhether your child has been issued a passport. If you are concerned about aninternational abduction, you may also ask to have your child’s name entered inthe Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program. Once your child’s name isentered your attorney or you should be notified if an application for a U.S. pass-port for your child is received anywhere in the United States or at any U.S.embassy or consulate.

and “Fact Sheet on Passports for Family Law Judges and Lawyers” links.
Prevent Issuance of Child’s U.S. Passport
To reduce the possibility a U.S. passport might be obtained to facilitate an abduc-tion, the law now requires any person applying for a U.S. passport for a childyounger than 16 to demonstrate both parents’ consent to its issuance or the appli-cant parent has sole authority to obtain a passport for a child.
To prevent the other parent from obtaining a U.S. passport for the child, seek
a court order or provision in a custody order granting you the right to obtain apassport without the consent of the other parent and prohibiting the other parentfrom applying for a passport on the child’s behalf. Send a copy of the order to theU.S. Department of State with a request to deny issuance of a passport for thechild sought by the other parent. Also view additional information at the U.S.
Department of State’s website at www.travel.state.gov. From the home pageclick on the “Children & Family” link. Under the “International Parental ChildAbduction” heading click on the “Guarding against & responding to parentalchild abduction” link. Then respectively click on the “Prevention” and

port that has already been issued to a child. You can, however, ask the court toorder the other parent to surrender your child’s passport(s). Then take the stepsoutlined above to block issuance of a replacement U.S. passport.
The abductor’s U.S. passport is subject to revocation by the U.S. Department
of State, and issuance of a U.S. passport to the abductor may be denied, at therequest of federal law-enforcement authorities such as the FBI, U.S. Attorney,
or U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Department of State does not discusssuch ac tions with left-behind parents . See the section titled “Criminal Remedies

If your child is a dual national you can request the foreign government’s
coop eration not to issue travel documents for your child. Although the foreign
government is not legally required to help you, or even comply with court ordersdirecting or requesting them not to issue passports for a child, it may do so volun-tarily. You can write to the foreign embassy or consulate and ask that your childnot be issued a passport or other travel documents. You can also ask to be notifiedif they receive an application for a passport or visa for your child. Send a certified
copy of your custody decree with your letter. Tell them you are sending a copy of
the request to the U.S. Department of State, and make sure you do so. If yourchild is a citizen of the United States and not a dual national, you can request theforeign embassy not to issue a visa or other travel documents for your child.
Civil Remedies in International Abductions
This section expands on the information contained in the chapter titled “Civil-Court Remedies If Your Child Is Abducted” beginning on page 23.
The Hague Convention on the
Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction
The Hague Convention provides a private right of action to seek the prompt
return of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained within the mean-ing of the Hague Convention when the child is younger than 16 and the countriesinvolved are treaty partners. The Hague Convention is also intended to help par-ents secure the exercise of access or visitation rights across international borders.
For information about the Hague Convention visit www.hcch.net. From the
home page click on the “Welcome” link. Then click on the “Child AbductionSection” link. Also visit www.travel.state.gov. From the home page click on the“Children & Family” link. Under the “International Parental Child Abduction”heading then click on the “Guarding against & responding to parental childabduction” link.
The Hague Convention took effect in the United States in 1988 following its
ratification and enactment of a federal implementing statute, the InternationalChild Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 11601-11610. ICARAestablishes pro cedures for bringing legal action for the return of children who
have been wrongfully removed to or retained in the United States. If your childhas been abducted to another country, you must follow procedures established
by that country to invoke the Hague Convention.

When is a removal or retention “wrongful” under the Hague Convention?
A removal or retention is wrongful under the Hague Convention if it is in breach
of custody rights that were actually exercised or would have been but for theremoval or retention. Custody rights arise under the laws of the country in whichthe child was a habitual resident immediately before the removal or retention.
They may arise by operation of law, court order, or agreement and may beexercised jointly or alone.
Do you need a custody order to seek return under the Hague Convention?
No. A removal or retention may be wrongful even if there is no custody order ineffect. This recognizes many abductions occur before there is a custody order.It also makes sense in light of the Hague Convention’s goal of swiftly restoring achild to his or her pre-abduction/retention circumstances so courts in the child’scountry of habitual residence can make appropriate custody decisions. A decisionto return is not on the merits of custody.
What is the return obligation, and are there any exceptions?
Under Article 12 of the Hague Convention a court must order return if less thana year has elapsed between the time of the wrongful removal and retention andcommencement of the return proceedings. Return is still required a year or moreafter the abduction unless the abductor demonstrates the child is now settled inhis or her new environment.
Article 13 of the Hague Convention provides three exceptions to the return
obligation. Article 13(a) allows a defense if the person claiming a breach ofFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -115custody rights was not actually exercising those rights or had consented to or
subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention. Under Article 13(b), a childneed not be returned if there is a grave risk that return would expose the child tophysical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable
situation. Ar ticle 13 also allows a judge to refuse return if a mature child objects.
Article 20 provides the child’s return may be refused if return would not be per-mitted by the fundamental principles of the requested country relating to theprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Courts may order a childreturned even if a defense to return is proved.
Does the Hague Convention address visitation rights?
The Hague Convention is also intended to help parents secure the exercise ofaccess or visitation rights across international borders, although the Article 21remedy has proven to be of limited effectiveness. The remedy for breach of
access rights does not in clude the right of return.
What is a “Central Authority”?
In addition to judicial remedies, the Hague Convention establishes administrative
mechanisms to facilitate return of abducted children and the exercise of access/visitation rights. Each country is required to establish a “Central Authority” tocarry out duties listed in the Hague Convention. These duties include locatingchildren, processing requests for assistance in incoming and outgoing cases, andcooperating with other Central Authorities to secure the prompt return of thechild and achieve the other objectives of the Hague Convention.
The Office of Children’s Issues (OCI) in the U.S. Department of State is the
U.S. Central Authority for the Hague Convention for both outgoing and
incoming cases. Parents of children ab ducted from  the United States to a Hague
Convention country should contact OCI toll-free at 1-888-407-4747 or by dialing
directly at 202-736-9090. Parents may also contact NCMEC’s Missing Children
Division at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632) for instructions about how toproceed under the Hague Convention. You can obtain a return application bycalling the telephone numbers above. The application is also available online atwww.travel.state.gov. From the home page click on the “Children & Family”link. Under the “International Parental Child Abduction” heading click on the
“Guarding against & responding to parental child abduction” link. Then
respectively click on the “ Resources” and “Hague Application” links. Also
an application for return is re printed beginning on page 271.
A parent may seek assistance from the Central Authority in the child’s coun-
try of habitual residence, directly from the foreign Central Authority, or bypassboth and instead commence return proceedings directly in the courts of thecountry where the child is located. The Central Authority in some countries
may be able to ar range free or reduced-fee legal representation for the applicant-
parent. The U.S. Central Authority can make an inquiry about this possibility
on behalf of the U.S.-based parent. OCI can also provide a list of English-
speaking lawyers in the country in question. The U.S. Central Authority alsohelps parents find attorneys in the United States in incoming cases.
Do you have to use the Hague Convention?
No. The Hague Convention remedies are not exclusive. A parent can seek the
child’s return using any available remedy. In outgoing cases this generally means- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 116hiring a foreign attorney in the country in which your child is located and seeking
to enforce a U.S. custody order or get a custody order from the foreign court. Ineither case foreign law applies and governs the outcome.
If you seek to have your U.S. custody order recognized in a foreign court,
your lawyer should be familiar with the principles of comity , in which courts of
different nations recognize each other’s orders. Comity is voluntary, not manda-tory, and usually requires reciprocity.
In incoming cases  parents may petition a court under state law, either
the UCCJA or UCCJEA, to enforce a foreign cus tody determination. This
remedy may be more meaningful than the Hague Convention in access cases,because state courts may order a child returned for visitation, whereas courtsapplying the Hague Convention do not have that option. The UCCJEA alsooffers the advantage of an expedited enforcement procedure, which may be
considerably faster than a Hague proceeding. Another option is petition-
ing for a child-custody determination in a state court having jurisdiction.
Non-Hague Remedies
Parents of children abducted to countries that are not U.S. treaty partners under
the Hague Convention must pursue other avenues to secure  the return of their
child. One alternative avenue is to ask a foreign court to enforce your U.S. cus-tody order. Another is to seek a custody order in the courts of the foreign country.Advice about how to proceed in the foreign court may be available from NCMEC’s
Missing Children Division at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632); the U.S.
Department of State’s Office of Children’s Issues toll-free at 1-888-407-4747 orby dialing directly at 202-736-9090; and private attorneys in the United Statesand foreign countries.
NCMEC can help by explaining the legal civil and criminal remedies that
may be available, providing legal technical assistance and guidance about attor-ney and mediation resources, and communicating with local and foreign lawenforcement. OCI can help by attempting to locate, visit, and report on yourchild’s general welfare; providing the left-behind parent with information about
the country to which his or her child was abducted including its legal system,
family laws, and a list of attorneys willing to accept clients from the United States;monitoring judicial or administrative proceedings in other countries; andproviding a point of contact for the left-behind parent.
Child-Snatching Lawsuits
Consider filing a child-snatching lawsuit against the abductor and accom-plices. See the chapter titled “Civil-Court Rem edies If Your Child Is Abducted”
beginning on page 23. If the abductor has assets remaining in the United States,consider bringing a civil, child-snatching lawsuit against the abductor in U.S.courts and attaching his or her U.S. as sets. If the abductor has received help
from friends or relatives who remain in the United States or have assets in thiscountry, consider suing them as well. The left-behind parent may be awardedmoney damages against the abductor and/or others who have assisted in theabduction. The discovery process in such a case may also produce informationabout a child’s location.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 117Criminal Remedies in International Abductions
This section expands on the information discussed in the chapter titled “Crimi-
nal Remedies in Family-Abduction Cases” beginning on page 41.
NCIC Missing-Person Entry
If you do not know your child’s whereabouts, report your child missing to lawenforcement and request entry of information about your child into the FBI’sNational Crime Information Center-Missing Person File (NCIC-MPF). Fed-eral law re quires entry within two hours of receipt of a report of a missing child.
If the abduction is in progress, such as the abductor is heading to the airport or
border with the child, law enforcement may issue an AMBER Alert if applicable
criteria are met.
Information in NCIC is accessible to federal border personnel via the Inter-
agency Border Inspection System (IBIS), a computerized database. IBIS checksdone at U.S. borders and international airports may result in intercepting abduc-tors as they leave or reenter the country.
INTERPOL
INTERPOL, the world’s largest international police organization with 186member countries including the United States, may be of assistance in interna-tional, child-abduction cases. Urge law enforcement to contact the U.S. NationalCentral Bureau (USNCB)-INTERPOL for assistance. USNCB-INTERPOL serveslocal, state, and federal law enforcement but not parents . If contacted by law
enforcement on an urgent basis USNCB-INTERPOL may help stop an interna-tional abduction-in-progress. INTERPOL may also be of assistance in abductionsthat have already taken place.
Law enforcement can contact USNCB-INTERPOL at 202-616-9000 or via Nlets,
The International Justice and Public Safety Network, at DCINTER00. Alterna-tively law enforcement can contact NCMEC via Nlets at VA007019W. NCMECacts as a liaison with INTERPOL for cases involving missing children.
USNCB-INTERPOL can transmit messages, called “diffusions,” at any time
and without delay to one or any number of other national central bureaus asking
law-enforcement authorities in those countries to search for a fugitive charged
with a crime; trace and locate an abductor, whether or not charged with a crime;and/or locate and determine the safety and welfare of a missing or abducted child.
USNCB-INTERPOL may also apply to INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon,
France, for color-coded notices. The process takes at least several months.Red notices seek people wanted for extradition. Blue “trace and locate”notices seek people, including abductors, whether or not they have been
charged with a crime. Yellow “missing person” notices seek people who are
missing including abducted children. USNCB-INTERPOL has no control overhow foreign law enforcement handles diffusions and color-coded notices. Thatdepends on local law and practice.
Prosecution
Weigh the pros and cons of criminal prosecution, which are discussed in the chaptertitled “Criminal Remedies in Family-Abduction Cases” beginning on page 41.- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 118Caveat: Criminal charges in the United States against the abductor may hinder
return of the child from some Hague Convention countries.
If you choose to pursue criminal charges meet with the prosecutor or U.S.
Attorney to discuss the possibility of charging the abductor with a felony crime.
If state felony charges are filed ask the prosecutor to apply for a federal UFAP
warrant under the Fugitive Felon Act. Issuance of a UFAP warrant brings the FBI
into the investigation. This may improve the chances of locating the abductor andincidentally recovering the child.
Alternatively check with the U.S. Attorney about charging the abductor with
violating IPKCA. IPKCA makes international parental kidnapping and attemptedinternational parental kidnapping federal felonies. If an abductor is criminallycharged under state law, then federal charges are unlikely. If the crime has notbeen or cannot be charged under state laws, only federal charges may be avail-able. Extradition is possible for both federal and state charges.
U.S. Passports
Federal felony charges or a UFAP warrant provide grounds for revoking theabductor’s U.S. passport or denying issuance of a U.S. passport to the abductor.In addition a passport may be revoked if the passport holder is subject to a crimi-nal court order, condition of probation, or parole – any of which forbiddeparture from the United States, and the violation of which could sub-
ject the applicant to a provision of the Fugitive Felon Act.
Federal law enforcement may ask the Office of Passport Services of the U.S.
Department of State to revoke the abductor’s U.S. passport. Revocation of a U.S.passport may not burden a dual-national abductor who holds a passport fromanother country; however, a non-dual national citizen of the United Statesbecomes an undocumented alien in a foreign country once his or her U.S.passport is revoked. Many countries will deport, or at least question, anundocumented alien.
Information is available from the Office of Passport Policy and Advisory
Services at 202-663-2662 and www.travel.state.gov. From the home page clickon the “ Apply for a Passport” link. Then in the left-hand column under the“Passport Policy Information” heading click on the “Information for LawEnforcement” link.
FBI Investigation
Contact the FBI to request an investigation. The FBI is the law-enforcement agency
responsible for investigating international, parental-kidnapping cases underfederal law. The FBI may find a child in the course of a UFAP or IPKCA investiga-tion. If an abductor is in another country, the FBI Legal Attaché stationed at theU.S. embassy in that country may request assistance from local law enforce-
ment in that country either to locate or confirm a location of the ab ductor
and child. Al though the FBI may not disclose sensitive investigative information
to a parent, the Special Agent may notify the left-behind parent if the child isfound so the parent can pursue civil remedies to secure the child’s return.
Extradition
A prosecutor or U.S. Attorney seeking to extradite the abductor must coordinateinternational extradition with the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division,FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 119Office of International Affairs at 202-514-0000, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Northwest, W ashington, DC 20530-0001. As discussed in the section titled
“Extradition” beginning on page 59 some countries will not extradite their own
nationals. If the abductor can be arr ested in a country from which extradition to
the United States is possible, extradition of the abduc tor might be accomplished
even though the abductor ordinarily resides in a coun try that will not extradite
for this crime.
Although extradition applies only to the abductor, not a child, it is possible
the abductor will return a child “voluntarily” or the foreign authorities may assistin returning a child coincident with the abductor’s arrest. But it is also possiblefor an abductor to return to the United States to stand trial while leaving thechild behind with family or friends in a foreign country. It is important for theleft-behind parent to make arrangements to secure his or her child’s return evenas the government is pursuing the abductor’s extradition.

If your child is in a Hague Convention country, OCI, acting as the U.S.
Central Authority, or the left-behind parent, can ask the foreign Central Author-ity to locate the abducted child and report on the child’s condition.
U.S. embassy or consular officials in the Hague or non-Hague Convention
country can also be called upon by OCI or a left-behind parent to conduct a“welfare and whereabouts” check about a citizen of the United States, includinga dual national, and report back to the left-behind parent. Embassy officials are
not private investigators. Left-behind parents can help by being as specific aspossible about the abductor’s likely travel plans or location. U.S. embassyofficials can seek information about your child’s whereabouts from entry andresidence records kept by local governments. In many instances, however,these records are not kept in an easily retrievable form by the abductor’s coun-try and, on occasion, the country will not release information from such recordsto officials of the United States. OCI may call upon the Diplomatic SecurityService-Regional Security Officer (DSS-RSO) at the U.S. embassy for help.The DSS-RSO enlists the help of foreign law-enforcement contacts to deter-mine the child’s whereabouts even if there is no warrant for the abductor.
As part of the welfare and whereabouts check, the U.S. embassy will send a
Consular Official to visit your child. If the abductor refuses to allow the U.S.Consular Official to see your child, the official will ask the local authorities forhelp. For instance local social workers may be asked to try to visit your child. Ifthere is evidence of child abuse or neglect, the U.S. consular officials will try tohave a child removed from the home and child-abuse or neglect proceedingsinitiated by the local government.FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 121If you have serious concerns about your child’s health or welfare, assistance

Your Search
Try to locate your child on your own. Many search strategies described in thechapter titled “Searching for Your Child,” beginning on page 63, can be adaptedfor use when your child is missing in another country.
Seek advice from other families victimized by international parental
abduction. Call Team HOPE at 1-866-305-HOPE (1-866-305-4673) to be
matched with someone who has experienced the family abduction of a child.
Contact a missing-children organization specializing in international parentalkidnapping. Discuss your case with your missing-child clearinghouse. Referto the section titled “Nationwide Directory of Family-Abduction Laws andResources” beginning on page 199 for contact information. Ask NCMEC fortechnical assistance.
If you believe the abductor’s friends or relatives may be sympa thetic to your
cause, try to use their concern for your child’s welfare to obtain their assis-
tance. But beware of possible complications as described in the chapter titled
“Criminal Remedies in Family-Abduction Cases” beginning on page 41.
Try to trace the abductor’s sources of financial support such as bank accounts,
credit cards, and loans. Contact financial institutions and credit-card companies
and ask for the abductor’s current address information, which may or may not bedisclosed to you.
Find out how the abductor left the country. Contact airlines, rental-vehicle
companies, and similar businesses. Show pictures of the abductor and your child.Talk to U .S. border personnel at international air ports and borders near your
home. They may recognize pictures of your child and the abductor. Consider
the possibility the abductor did not take a direct route but may have traveledto Canada or Mexico before boarding an airplane, bus, or train.
Other useful leads may be generated from mail covers; telephone bills;
flags on birth, medical, and school records; prosecution of accomplices; andthe Federal Parent Locator Service. You will need law enforcement’s help orsubpoenas to get much of this information.
Recovering Children Who AreVictims of International Abduction
This section focuses on recovering your child from another country. It adds theinternational dimension to the information contained in the chapter titled“Recovering Your Child” beginning on page 93.
Voluntary Return
You may be able to negotiate the voluntary return of your child. The U.S. andforeign central authorities may be able to help in some Hague Convention cases.Child Find
® of America’s mediation program at 1-800-A-WAY-OUT (1-800-292-
9688) or www.childfind®ofamerica.org may also be of assistance in facilitating a
resolution. If a U.S. citizen-parent successfully negotiates the release of a child- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEwho is a citizen of the United States and obtains physical possession of the child
from the abductor, and there is no court order prohibiting the parent fromremoving the child from the foreign country, the U.S. embassy or consulate inthat country can provide passports and assist such parents in obtaining exitpermits. Under certain circumstances U.S. embassies and consulates can pro-
vide repatriation loans to fund the child’s travel home. Financial assistance
may also be available from NCMEC for searching parents to travel to othercountries to attend hearings and recover a child. Contact NCMEC’s FamilyAdvocacy Division at 1-888-24-NCMEC (1-888-246-2632) for more informa-tion about the “Victim Travel Reunification Program.”
When the Abductor Is Not a Citizen of the United States
Contact the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-tion Services Bureau (USCIS) to discuss the abductor’s immigration sta tus. If
an abductor is a foreigner who continues to hold a visa to enter the United Statesor has a U.S. work permit known as a “Green Card,” it may be useful to explorewith USCIS the circumstances under which these permits may be revoked or
suspended. Such action could pressure the abductor to return the child. Upon
request USCIS may be willing to flag communications from the abductor.Contact USCIS by calling the National Customer Service Center toll-free at1-800-375-5283. You may also discuss immigration-related issues with an Abduc-tion Officer in the Office of Children’s Issues or a Case Manager at NCMEC’sMissing Children Division.
Work with an OCI Abduction Officer to flag visa requests for people who
may be ineligible for admission into the United States under the “ Alien ExclusionAct,” section 212(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §
1182(a)(10)(C). Under this law non-U.S. citizen parents who abduct U.S. citizen
children to non-Hague Convention countries in violation of custody orders, andaliens who assist or provide material support to the abductor, may be deniedadmission to the United States until the child is surrendered to the lawfulcusto dian in the United States. Because the child’s return is a precondition to
obtaining a visa to enter the United States, the law provides leverage to negotiatethe child’s return.
Alternatives When Voluntary Return Is Not Possible
If voluntary return is not possible, other methods of recovery include
Filing an action under the Hague Convention for the prompt return of
your child
Going to court in the foreign country and asking the court to honor yourcustody decree as issued in the United States
Going to court in the foreign country and asking the court to award you cus-tody in the best interests of the child as judged by their standards
Accepting the situation and, perhaps, being allowed visitation
You should discuss legal recovery options with those most familiar with
international kidnapping in the United States and the country in which the
abductor is living. OCI may be a good source of information about the policiesand customs of foreign countries. OCI and NCMEC may have advice aboutmethods of recovery in the particular country.
122FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Countries party to the Hague Convention have legal and administrative mecha-
nisms for securing the prompt return of abducted children. In non-Hague
Convention countries, options for return include bringing a lawsuit to enforce aU.S. custody order, which depends upon the foreign court voluntarily recogniz-ing the U.S. order based on principles of comity , or petitioning for custody in the
foreign court. Methods and results will vary from country-to-country. Sometimescultural and religious differences between the United States and certain othercountries may make recovery difficult or even impossible.
To obtain authoritative advice about the laws of a foreign country or take
legal action in that country, you will need the help of an attorney there. InHague Convention cases the foreign Central Authority may provide free orreduced-fee counsel. The U.S. Central Authority can inquire on your behalfabout this possibility. Other sources of referrals to lawyers who can help liti-gate in a foreign court are found beginning on page 30. These sources
include embassy and consulate website postings of attorney lists,
usembassy.state.gov, and the U.S. Department of State’s Office of AmericanCitizens Services and Crisis Management at 202-736-9090.
The Office of Citizens Consular Services and U.S. embassy can provide

Abductors Connected With the U.S. Military
Enforcing a custody order against a person on active duty in the military who isstationed in another country can be problematic. Even assuming a left-behindparent could afford to litigate in another country, treaties called Status of ForcesAgreements (SOFAs) generally protect members of the U.S. armed forces againstlawsuits, including actions to enforce U.S. custody orders, brought in the civilian
courts of the country in which they are stationed.
If the abductor is connected with the U.S. military and stationed in another
country, instead of seeking relief in the foreign courts, consider contacting the
commanding officer of the base where the person is stationed to request help.Defense Department Instruction 5525.09 (Instruction), titled “Compliance of DoDMembers, Employees, and Family Members Outside the United States With CourtOrders,” requires base commanders at installations in other countries to cooper-ate with courts and officials who request assistance in enforcing court orders.
The Instruction provides explicit guidance when a re quest pertains to a felony
or contempt involving the unlawful or contemptuous removal of a child from thejurisdiction of a court or the custody of a parent or another person awardedcustody by court order. The remedies vary depending on whether the request
concerns an active-duty military member, a civilian employee, or an accompany-
ing family member.
According to the Instruction, in cases involving active-duty military members,
if the matter cannot be resolved with the court without the member returning tothe United States, the member shall be ordered to return expeditiously to the
123- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEUnited States, unless an exception is granted. Civilian employees serving outside
the United States and family members accompanying active military or civilianemployees, though not subject to return to the United States, are stronglyencouraged to comply with court orders, and may be sanctioned fornoncompliance including withdrawal of command sponsorship. Although the
child is not the subject of a return order or other sanctions, any formal punitive
measure taken against a parent may have a coercive effect resulting in the childbeing returned to the United States. A copy of the Instruction is reprintedbeginning on page 187.
Individual cases that cannot be resolved within the service member’s chain of
command may be brought to the attention of the Secretary of the MilitaryDepartment concerned at

How Public Officials May Help
Consider seeking political support within the United States to give you leveragein the foreign country. Representatives and Senators in Congress; members
of the Senate Caucus on Missing, Ex ploited and Runaway Children and Con-
gressional Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children; the U.S. Secretary of State,the U.S. Attorney General, and the President of the United States cannotsecure your child’s return from another country di rectly. Also they cannot

Avoid Self-Help Recovery: Do Not Attempt a “Snatch-Back”
Newspaper articles from time-to-time relate stories of parents resnatching theirchild from foreign countries. Such a course of action is strongly discouraged. It isdangerous both for a child involved and parent attempting it. As described in thechapter titled “Psychological Issues in Recovery and Family Reunification,”beginning on page 127, the psychological effects of the abduction can have a
serious effect on the well-being of the child and left-behind family. Attempting a
snatch-back can cause additional physical and emotional harm to the childand parent.
Many countries closely regulate their borders and may maintain special look-
outs for children likely to be resnatched. Officials of the United States stationedin the foreign country will be unable to assist a U.S. citizen-parent who isattempting a snatch-back. If a parent is caught attempting a snatch-back, he orshe could be arrested and imprisoned in foreign jails. If the parent is not impris-oned, he or she may be deported. Deportation, however, may preclude any
future visitation with a child in that country or elsewhere.

125- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE 116FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Psychological Issues in Recovery
and Family Reunification
by JoAnn Behrman-Lippert and the late Chris Hatcher
Chapter Overview
Over the course of a family abduction searching parents actively engage in thesearch process for their missing child and experience considerable distress andconcern over their child’s welfare. Fortunately many of these children are recov-ered and returned home. Each left-behind parent looks forward to the day of thechild’s recovery. To assist the left-behind parent and family in the reunification
process this section describes the psychological issues involved in child recovery
and family reunification, makes recommendations for arranging the initial reuni-fication meeting, and describes psychological issues after reunification. Below is asummary of the key points  more fully described in this chapter.
1. An abducted child’s reunification with, and readjustment to, his or her family
is determined by the three factors of the particular events that occurredduring the abduction; internal way in which the child tried to understand andcope with the abduction; and expectations of the left-behind parent andabducted child about recovery.
2. The abductor’s behavior before and during the abduction affect the child’s
views not only about the abductor and thus the situation, but also about theleft-behind parent. Reunification with the left-behind parent is influenced by
these perceptions.
3. Recovered children and the recovering family have different needs that should
be addressed by establishing a reunification plan. The plan should address the
role of law enforcement in the recovery process.
4. After recovery it is common for abducted children to fear reabduction,
struggle with guilt and shame surrounding the abduction, and experienceconflicting loyalty demands. At the same time families may face significantreadjustment issues. Friends, family members, and professional counselorsmay play an important role in post-recovery adjustment issues and planningfor the future.

bers are adults who were abducted as children.
FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 127Psychological 
Issues- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEPsychological 
IssuesFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -When children who have been abducted by a parent are recovered, there are
three important factors that will affect the child’s ability to successfully returnhome and reenter the family they were taken from.
First each family abduction case is different. Some children are away from
home for a short period of time and told they are only on an extended visitation.
Other children are away from home for periods of months or years, given new
names, kept out of school, told the left-behind parent has harmed or was intend-ing to harm them, and experience a fugitive lifestyle.
Second each abducted child is different. Some children are perceptive and
understand more quickly the abducting parent’s explanation they are on anextended vacation is not true. These children then experience both significantemotional distress for themselves and concern for the left-behind parent, eventhough the actual length of the abduction may be limited. The children may findthe fugitive lifestyle different and exciting or cooperate in order to maintain the
abducting parent’s increased level of positive attention toward them.
Third the reunification expectations of the searching parent and recovered
child can be quite different. For some families the reunification is indeed the
happy and joyous event hoped for. For other families the child may not, how-ever, be initially happy to be recovered. This is especially true if the child’sabsence from home has been lengthy resulting in the child becoming attached toa different home, friends, and activities. Still other children are angry with theleft-behind parent, believing they may have been abandoned or the parentmay have allowed the abduction to occur. Frequently children appear fearful
the left-behind parent will be angry and blame the child for the abduction.
In summary the recovered child’s reunification with the family and readjust-
ment is then determined by the combination of the three factors of the
Particular set of events that occurred during this child’s abduction
Internal way in which the child tried to understand and cope with the abduction
Expectations of the searching parent and child about recovery and fam-
ily re-entry
Specific Issues Prior to Recovery
The behavior of the abducting parent prior to the abduction is a key point to
understand. You should pay particular attention to the degree of preparationthe parent took to abduct your child, if known, and your child’s level ofparticipation, if any, in the abduction planning. Parents who carry out well-organized, carefully planned abductions have thought-out justifications for theabduction. As a result of such a well-thought-out abduction the child experiencesrapid, planned movement marked by plausible explanations for removal fromthe other parent. The child’s initial perception, then, is one of being cared for andattended to, reducing stress or confusion over leaving the home of the other par-ent. Unfortunately the child may later learn the abducting parent’s behavior wasnot really focused on the child’s best interests. This creates substantial disappoint-ment and disillusionment for the child. Alternatively, disorganized abductions
create confusion for the child. In an effort to create order out of confu sion the
child frequently responds by attempting to take care of the disorganized, emo-tional abducting parent. Upon recovery such children are concerned with the
129- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEwelfare, health, and arrest status of the abducting parent and are less interested in
the reunification process with the left-behind parent.
During the abduction the abducting parent may believe, in addition to con-
vincing him- or herself taking the child is the right thing to do, that it is necessaryto convince the child as well. Frequently this means talking to the child about the
“harm” being done to him or her by the left-behind parent until the child will
verbally repeat back the adult’s concerns. These communications to the childabout the left-behind parent may vary from representing the abducting parent assimply the better parent to labeling the left-behind parent as harmful or havingabandoned the child. Children may be told the left-behind parent is alcohol ordrug addicted. An abducting parent may tell a child he or she loves the childmore than the left-behind parent or cannot live without the child or the child infact belongs to him or her alone. In a few cases children have been told the left-behind parent will hurt or kill them if found.
Living conditions during the abduction are important to the child as well.
While some abducting parents and children create a new identity while living ina new home environment, most live with relatives or friends or move frequentlyliving out of motels or campers. These children suffer from school denial, fre-quent school changes, and a lack of other children with whom they can interact.Parentally abducted children, at times, are subtle victims of medical neglect anddeferred medical care. This can occur through failure to obtain preventative caresuch as immunizations, diagnostic care such as medical exams, remedial caresuch as regular medication or nonemergency surgery, or prosthetic care such
as eyeglasses.
Reunification Recommendations
Experience with the reunification of recovered children with their families indi-cates each member has an individual set of needs. The needs of the recoveredchild are
A safe transition from the abducting parent to law enforcement and then to
the recovering parent
An explanation about what is happening during this transition process
Evaluation and treatment, as necessary, for physical injury and psychologicaldistress related to the disappearance
The needs of the recovering family are to be informed of
The recovery of the child
The circumstances of recovery
Preliminary knowledge of the child’s physical and mental health
Reunification meeting options
Media contact options
Psychological counseling resources
The anticipated next steps in criminal/civil court proceedings
The needs of both the recovered child and recovering family can be met by
taking the actions noted below to establish a reunification plan.
130FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Prior to the Reunification
The left-behind parent and law-enforcement officer in charge of the case should
work together to agree upon recovery notification procedures; the investigatingofficer’s level of on-site involvement if the child recovery is in another jurisdictionor country; and what reunification assistance resources may be available throughthe National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
®; missing-child clearing-
houses; and any local, nonprofit, missing-children organization.
The left-behind parent and law-enforcement officer in charge of the case should
work together to agree upon what efforts should be made to provide support andinformation to the child pending the arrival of the recovering parent. The child
needs to have an explanation about what is happening and will happen next. If
the return of the child is voluntary or without resistance, it is possible and prefer-able for the abducting parent to provide such an explanation to the child and forgood-byes to be said. If the return of the child is involuntary and involvesresis tance or arrest of the abducting parent, the law-enforcement officer or child-
protective-service worker will need to provide an initial explanation to the childof what is happening and will happen until the other parent arrives.
Upon Notification of the Location of the Child
In addition to arranging travel to the recovery location for him- or herself and anyother family members, the left-behind parent needs to prepare legal documentsand consult, as needed, with local authorities in the jurisdiction where the child isfound. Arrangements should be made with someone, perhaps a relative, familyfriend, or neighbor, to care for the needs of the remaining family members in the
home who will not be going to the reunification. During his or her absence
the recovering parent should keep in regular contact with the caregiver tokeep the other children in the family informed about reunification eventsand return travel plans.
The searching parent should provide for welcoming the recovered child. This
may include bringing to the reunification location a favorite possession leftbehind and/or past and present photographs of family members, family events,or family pets especially if the child was close to a certain pet. These items can beuseful in helping the child recall past positive memories as well as providing some-thing to discuss during the initial reunification meeting. Depending on the age ofthe child, it may also be useful to take missing-child posters or newspaper articleswith the child’s name or picture to provide concrete indicators to the child of yourefforts to find him or her.
At the Reunification Meeting
The recovering parent should request the law-enforcement officer or other agencypersonnel at the planned reunification location provide a room and time for thechild and parent to become reacquainted before leaving for home.
The recovering parent should recognize that media attention in highly
publicized cases may be intense. It is important to remember the needs of therecovered child and family always come first. The recovering par ent desiring
privacy should request assistance from the other professionals in volved in
the reunification process.
131- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEPsychological Considerations/What a Parent Can Expect
Recovering parents should be aware during reunifications recovered children may
be hesitant, fearful, angry, or confused. In some cases the children may not even
remember left-behind family members. In such situations the recovering parent’sbest response is to continue to proceed to let the child know how happy he or sheis the child has been found and focus on welcoming the child home.
The recovering parent should recognize on the child’s first night home the
child is most likely to be focused on being in the room in which his or her bed islocated, becoming reacquainted with other family members, and relearning otheraspects of family interaction rather than talking about the disappearance. Therecovering parent may experience mixed feelings. On the one hand there is unde-niable relief the child has been recovered. On the other hand there is also a degreeof anxiety and concern over not knowing what happened to the child during hisor her absence and the possibility of future contact with the parent who abductedthe child.
Specific Issues After Recovery
Most recovering parents are interested in knowing what specific psychologicaland adjustment issues have been encountered by other children and familiesafter child recovery from parental abduction.
Most children who have been parentally abducted have initial concerns about
safety and reabduction expressed through dreams, play/sleep difficulties, and
specific fears about reabduction. Reabduction dreams more characteristically have
to do with a child being taken away by a nonspecific adult from the currentparent. Reabduction play involves reenacting the abduction itself or activities withthemes of abduction fear and protection. In one case a young boy who was fearfulof reabduction discovered a mouse under the kitchen sink. He then took little“weapons” from a set of toys to give to the mouse creating a “super” mouse whobecame the boy’s protector against reabduction.
Most recovered children struggle with guilt and shame around the abduction
event. It is important to understand the child’s knowledge of being abducted. If
the child is aware he or she was being abducted, the child frequently feels respon-
sible for not seeking help or calling home. Further, when the child realizes theabducting parent’s statements about the left-behind parent were not true, thechild feels guilty for not having seen this earlier. In a few cases the child truly doesnot understand what happened and feels responsible for not having known.Abducting parents also sometimes involve the child as a co-conspirator askingthe child to assist in the process of not being discovered. In the child’s mind evad-
ing discovery as part of the fugitive lifestyle may be like a game until real life
intrudes. In one case a 7-year-old child described, in an animated and excitedmanner, hiding in a building when her mother and she knew law enforcementwas looking for them. This game took on a very different meaning, however,when law enforcement came into the building, arrested the mother, and tookthem away.
After recovery children are often caught in conflicting loyalty demands. Overall,
children tend to be good at assessing adult reactions to them especially in situa-
132FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -tions where the risk of loss is high. In order to preserve a sense of safety the child
will most likely assume the attitudes and behavior expected of them by theabducting parent. Meanwhile the recovering parent must go through a lengthyand frustrating process of locating and recovering his or her child, inevitably pro-ducing a degree of anger toward the abducting parent. After the recovery the
recovering parent may find it difficult not to communicate such anger and hostil-
ity about the abducting parent directly or indirectly to the child. This may resultin the child feeling pressured to choose sides. In one case, nine months after
his recovery and return, a child was aware of the ong oing legal actions between
the custodial mother and father who had abducted him. In his play the boy wouldalways represent the mother and father figures in the family as being in conflict.As the legal disagreements increased, the boy finally announced his “playmates”wanted to get rid of both parents and get new ones in their place.
Planning for the Future: Recovery Resources
In the weeks and months after recovery many families find themselves facingsignificant readjustment difficulties. Relatives and family friends can be impor-tant sources of help and support during this time. Psychologists and othermental-health professionals can also play an important role. There may be a needfor family counseling including the child, parents, and siblings. Local psycho-
logical, mental-health, and medical associations can help identify mental-health
resources in your community. If possible find a therapist who has experience inparental abduction or missing-child cases. Remember a child’s readjustmentmay not be quick or easy especially if the child has been absent for a longperiod of time.

Chapter Overview
Parental abduction occurs within the context of failed adult relationships. A par-
ent snatches a child either as a marital or nonmarital relationship is breaking upor within a period of time ranging from a few days to a few years afterward.Whereas a great deal of attention has been focused on children of divorce, theconsequences of this related traumatic event have been virtually ignored.
Child-custody disputes and marital breakups tear at the fabric of the family
placing children and sometimes parents in impossible situations to which there
rarely are resolutions satisfying everyone. At the far end of the divorce
continuum are those relationship problems or custody disputes including a kid-napping or other illegal acts.
This chapter attempts to advance an understanding of children who
are ab ducted by reporting on the findings of a study and sharing the abduction
experience of one family. Below is a summary of the key points  more fully
described in this chapter.
1. A study of 371 left-behind parents found a significant number of ab ducted
children were at risk of psychological harm prior to the abduction due to
issues in the home including domestic violence; substance abuse or emotionalproblems; and physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse.
2. The findings indicate a child’s age at the time of the abduction may affect how
the child experiences the abduction.
3. Overall functioning was believed to have declined in more than half of
the children between the time they were taken and returned to theleft-behind parent.

FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  - 135Impact of 
Abduction- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEImpact of 
AbductionFAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -The Study
We compiled a sample of 371 left-behind parents, nearly half of whom had
recov ered their children, by enlisting the assistance of 15 missing-children orga-
nizations throughout the United States and Canada. The organizations mailedeight-page questionnaires to parents who had approached them for help in locat-ing their children. The findings noted below help frame the parents’ perspectives
about their pre- and post-recovery situations.
A significant number described their home life prior to the abduction as cha-
otic, thus placing the children at risk for psychological problems even before the
abduction. Domestic violence was present in 54 percent of the relationships. Theabductor’s substance abuse, at 15 percent, or emotional problems, at 16 percent,were blamed for the breakup in a significant percentage of the relationships, andabduction was threatened in advance of the actual event in almost half of thesituations. Children were taken to other countries and subjected to a new culturewhile hiding in 21 percent of the abduction cases studied.
Children who were recovered were described by the recovering parent as
having been physically abused, at 23 percent; sexually abused, at 7 percent; andboth physically and sexually abused, at 5 percent. Children were also exposedto a range of other abusive behaviors such as being screamed at, threatened,and witness to adult-to-adult fighting.
The findings indicate the age of the children may affect how they experience
abduction. Older children may suffer differently than younger children if, forexample, they blame themselves for not contacting the left-behind parent whenthey had the capacity to do so. A sense of guilt for not having made such a contact
may emerge. On the other hand younger children may be abducted at a time
when crucial developmental bonds are being formed with the left-behindparent. Such a break may result in serious emotional problems at the time orin the future.
Overall functioning was believed to have declined in more than half of the
children between the time they were taken from and returned to the left-behindparent. This finding was offered with caution, though, as parental assessment ofpre-abduction functioning appeared to be unrealistically high. Similarlyassess ment of post-abduction functioning could be affected by a parent’s desire
to characterize the child’s situation as negative in order to show how badly thechild was treated when missing. Behavior at home was the most problematic area
with grades, school behavior, and health showing a smaller decline. Three-
quar ters believed the abduction had some persisting negative effect. Over time a
majority of the children had been seen for psychological counseling.
One Family’s Experience
In order to provide the reader with a picture of one extended and traumaticabduction, following is the case of David and Susan. These children were 6 and 5years old, respectively, when they were located and returned to their mother, Ava,following more than three years of being held by their father.
David and Susan were the objects of a series of abductions when they were
both quite young. Their parents, Ava and Ralph, were married for a short timebefore Ralph became verbally and physically abusive toward Ava, as well as
137- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEaddicted to amphetamines. Major fights between the parents ensued. While never
the intentional targets of their father’s angry outbursts, the children would occa-sionally get nicked when objects were thrown. Ava finally fled with the childrento her mother’s house following one particularly abusive episode. Ralph locatedthem and forced them back home, beat up Ava, and locked her in a closet. She
escaped again with the children, this time to a women’s shelter in a different state.
With the shelter’s assistance she established a new life. Ralph once more foundthem and snatched the children after promising he was only interested in visita-tion. Three months later Ava tracked them down and snatched the children back.Weeks later her new hiding place was revealed to Ralph who once again took thechildren and went into hiding, this time for three and one-half years. During thattime the children had no contact with Ava who continued to search for them. Sheeventually remarried and had another child.
Life on the run was alternately exciting and terrifying especially for David.
Susan and he were trained not to trust law enforcement and avoid telling anyonetheir real names. They often went hungry but were given toys whenever theyasked for them. They were never enrolled in school. Most traumatic for Davidwas being exposed to his father’s drug taking and pornographic movies. In addi-tion David was sexually abused by a female sitter. Susan apparently was sparedmuch of this type of activity.
With assistance from a friend of Ralph’s, Ava located both children who were
in foster care in a different state following Ralph’s arrest and incarceration oncharges unrelated to the abduction. Ava said
The foster-care workers were shocked to see me. They and thechildren had been told first...I was dead and then that I was a pros-titute and drug user. Then here I was looking like a normal mother.While there was a battle going on between the foster-care people
and me as to who the children belonged to, Ralph was re leased
from jail, where he was serving time on other criminal charges,and snatched David from the foster home. The workers hadn’tknown who to believe, but when he snatched David right out ofthe foster home, they knew. I was then able to get a court order to
return custody to me which set the stage for my getting them back.
Susan, then 5 years old, was returned to Ava. As Ava described it, Susan greatly
enjoyed seeing her again. “It was just like in the movies. We ran and hugged each
other and were crying and everything. [My new husband] was there and he was
crying too.” Even though Susan did not remember Ava, it took only a few daysbefore she began feeling comfortable with her. Her experiences in foster homesand with her father had been so unhappy that the relationship Ava offered hereasily overcame any initial hesitations she had about living with her mother.
It would be another few months before David would rejoin the family. After
Ralph abducted him from the foster home, he drove to Canada. Ralph and Davidfinally were tracked down and caught after a high-speed chase, which ended
with their car crashing into a barrier and David flying through the windshield.
Ava recovered David, and Ralph went to prison for five years on kidnapping,drug, and theft charges.
138FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -Susan’s and David’s Adjustment
The authors interviewed the children on four separate occasions, beginning a few
months after David’s return to their mother and spanning the next three years. Atthe first interview Susan, who had been living with Ava for five months at thattime, was quiet and shy. She sat very close to her mother and gave the bare mini-mum of responses. She was alert and answered appropriately but, perhaps
because of her experiences while in hiding or foster care, had learned to offer
little information when questioned. Home schooling, initiated by her mother,was progressing well, and Susan was adjusting to her new half-sister. Susanstated she did not want to see her father and was afraid to speak or write tohim in prison.
David’s experiences left him in a more emotionally precarious position. He
had been missing longer, spent a number of months in a less satisfactory foster-care setting than Susan, and been exposed to much more abuse while with hisfather. He had also established a stronger identification with his father. His
adjustment to his mother, sister, new stepfather, and new half-sister was
problematic. Ava described David as not knowing right from wrong, constantlythrowing tantrums, crying 15 to 20 times a day if he was refused anything, andfrequently beating his head against the wall. Whereas Susan was seen as being “alittle lady,” David was perceived as acting out in ways similar to his father. Heentered counseling at a sexual assault center immediately upon his return home.
At the first interview with David he was extremely friendly and outgoing, had
difficulty with impulse control, could not sit still, and drew a picture re flect-
ing the skill level of a child much younger than 7 years of age. Like many
children who have such experiences, David had learned to get attention
through being affectionate and responsive to adults. Because he was veryyoung when first abducted, critical stages in his development were missed
and had to be experi enced for the first time with a loving parent like Ava. In
addition his moral development was stunted from living with a father who showedno regard for the law and encouraged illegal behavior.
Six months later, at the time of the second interview, improvement was noted.
David remained outgoing and loved the attention he received, yet he appeared tobe learning more clearly where appropriate boundaries between adults and chil-
dren should be drawn. Therapy was progressing and improved behavior was
noted at home. While he had at first been rooming with his youngest sibling,
David had moved into a room of his own in the basement of the family townhouse.
This was done in part to give David his own living space but also because Ava wassomewhat worried he might harm his half-sister.
During this time both children continued to be home-schooled by Ava.
Because they had never been in school, they both needed a great deal of remedialwork to catch up to their peers. In addition they had been away from Ava for somuch time she wanted to avail herself of every opportunity to be with them.Given their previous separations, home schooling enabled them to form a strongrelationship, which in turn improved the children’s self-concept.
At the third visit, 18 months later, Susan continued to show improvement
but other issues loomed for David. Susan seemed to have formed a close bondwith Ava. She was moving on with her life, and peer relations were not a problemfor her. David had spent an unsatisfactory year in public school and, with Susan,who had performed well academically in school, was being taught at home again.
139- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEApparently David was picked on a great deal by the other children and, even
though he was reportedly getting along well with children in the neighbor-hood, lacked social skills in the school setting. His academic performance wasnot at issue.
In addition contact with Ralph, who was still in prison, was upsetting the
family. David stated, “He calls and starts screaming at us and my mom and we allstart to cry. My mom just hangs up on him.” Despite the past dangers, Davidmentioned thinking about him a lot and wanting to see him. Then, with Ava’spermission, David produced a photograph of his father as well as a picture Ralphhad drawn from prison. Ava feared Ralph might try to reabduct the childrenwhen released from prison. Both children spoke fondly of their stepfather whowas described by Ava as being a positive influence in all of their lives.
On the fourth visit, a year later, the family had again undergone a change.
Ava’s husband had been ill and spent a number of months home from work. This
required the children to return to school outside of the home so he would have
quiet during the day as well as Ava’s attention. This time, at a new school, Davidbegan to flourish. As Ava stated with a laugh, “I think they like it [being in school]a lot more, and I think they like me a lot more now too! We were getting on eachother’s nerves. They are really finally adjusting well.”
Case Analysis
This case illustrates many issues. The children were kidnapped following monthsin an unstable home environment. They went into hiding; moved constantly;were told lies about their mother; had their identities changed; were taught toavoid legal authorities; were neglected; and at least one child, David, was abused.They also witnessed a great deal of Ralph’s aberrant and erratic behavior. In addi-
tion they were kept out of school and eventually removed from their father, with
whom David in particular had come to identify, and placed in foster homes.
When re turned to their mother, David had a difficult adjustment. He was uncon-
trollable for months and, almost two years later, continued to have problems inschool though his behavior at home improved. Time has proved to be beneficialto David, though some concerns persist. He remains obsessed with thoughts ofhis father. If he continues to identify with Ralph, he will have a harder time relat-ing to Ava and his stepfather. His sense of well-being may necessitate at somepoint a mourning for the loss of the “bad father” before he can accept the goodparts in himself and move on – something he is starting to do. Susan has had aneasier adjustment, though David’s problems affect her as is evidenced by her alsobeing home schooled a second time when David was removed from public school.
The fourth visit showed Ava had begun to experience her children more typi-
cally. She laughed at the need they had to spend time away from each other. Thisis a far cry from the mother who initially used home schooling to make up for losttime. Ava’s new realism should eventually pave the way for a normal parent-childseparation as the children reach adolescence.
This case example also illustrates children with rather different reactions to
abduction. How much of this is due to the different experiences of the children orbond formed between Ralph and David on the one hand and Susan and Ava onthe other is difficult to tell.

Interstate Child Custody, Visitation, and Abduction
Summary: The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) and the Uniform ChildCustody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) establish jurisdictional rules forinterstate child custody and visitation cases. A purpose of the jurisdictional scheme is toremove legal incentives for abducting children. The jurisdictional rules govern when astate court can make and modify custody and visitation orders. Whereas both laws requireinterstate enforcement of valid custody and visitation orders, only the UCCJEA providesnew enforcement procedures (including authorization for prosecutors and lawenforcement to become involved in the civil aspects of custody and visitation enforcement).Another key difference is that the UCCJEA, unlike the UCCJA, is consistent with the ParentalKidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), the federal law set forth below. This is importantbecause custody and visitation orders made consistently with the PKPA are entitled to beenforced and not modified in sister jurisdictions as a matter of federal law.
Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act
As of November 2008 the UCCJA remains the law in only 4 states (Massachusetts,Missouri, New Hampshire, and Vermont) and the territory of the Northern MarianaIslands. UCCJEA legislation has been introduced in the legislatures of Massachusetts,Missouri, and New Hampshire. Citations to these UCCJA statutes are in the “Nation-
wide Directory of Fam ily-Abduction Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199.
Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement ActAs of November 2008 the UCCJEA has been enacted, with some variations, by 46 states,the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a replacement for theUCCJA. Citations to these UCCJEA statutes are in the “Nationwide Directory of Family-
Abduction Laws and Resources” beginning on page 199. Information about the UCCJEA,including the text, is available at www.nccusl.org. From the home page click on the “FinalActs & Legislation” link.

The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (Pub. L. No. 96-611; 28 U.S.C. § 1738A),
as amended by the Visitation Rights Enforcement Act (Pub. L. No. 105-374) and theVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106-386 (2000))Summary: The PKPA has three parts. The first part requires appropriate authorities ofevery state to give “full faith and credit to child custody determinations” made consistentlywith its terms. The “full faith and credit” mandate applies to courts in every state, theDistrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessionsof the United States. The second part allows authorized persons to seek information fromthe Federal Parent Locator Service to determine the whereabouts of abductors andabducted children. The third part clarifies congressional intent that the federal Fugitive
Felon Act applies to parental kidnapping.

International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993

— Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the
Union and ordered to be printed.
SPONSOR: Mr. Brooks, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted the following.REPORT: To accompany H.R. 3378 — Including cost estimate of the Congressional
Budget Office
The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill (H.R. 3378) to amend
title 18, United States Code, with respect to parental kidnapping, and for other purposes,having considered the same, report favorably thereon without amendment and recom-mend that the bill do pass.
Summary and Purpose
H.R. 3378 is intended to deter the removal of children from the United States to
foreign countries in order to obstruct parental rights. It creates a Federal felonyoffense of interna tional parental kidnapping. Offenders may be punished by a fine under
title 18, imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both.
Background
Every year hundreds of children are taken from the United States to foreign countries
by parents who do not have legal custody. The rate of such cases has increased in recentyears. The State Department reported a total of 515 international parental child abductioncases from the United States during 1992.
1 That number capped a steady series of
increases from 320 such abductions during 1987.2 Some experts believe that these figures
are low and that the actual rate may be several times higher.3
These parental kidnappings seriously affect both the children and the parents
deprived of rightful custody. Some child psychologists believe that the trauma childrensuffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of child abuse.
4
Parental kidnapping is a criminal offense in all 50 states,5 and a felony in the majority
of these.6 But it is not a federal offense.
In the international cases which are the subject of this bill, the lack of a federal offense
and the federal criminal justice system consequences that would flow from such anoffense handicaps the pursuit of an effective remedy by the custodial, or “left-behind,”parent. This is primarily because violations of state parental kidnapping statutes eventhough they may be felony offenses do not in international practice provide an adequatebasis for effective pursuit and extradition.
In theory, an abducting parent who takes a child abroad may be pursued
through a federal warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution (UFAP).
7 In
179- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEpractice, however, UFAP warrants are often neither practicable nor effective in
international kidnapping cases.
State prosecutors may obtain UFAP warrants from U.S. Attorneys by tendering a
state felony warrant for the child’s abduction and showing probable cause that theabducting parent has fled the state.
8 However, this process requires that the state prosecu-
tor also agree to extradite the alleged abductor. Many state prosecutors are reluc tant
to spend the limited funds they have available for extradition on parental abduc-tion cases in general, and even more reluctant to expend those funds for the morecostly international extraditions.
9
Moreover, even if a UFAP warrant is obtained, it is of limited value in interna-
tional flight cases. This is because (1) the United States does not have extraditiontreaties with all  countries; (2) many countries with whom we have extradition trea-
ties will not extradite their own nationals; (3) unlawful flight to avoid prosecution isnot, itself, an extraditable offense; and, (4) the underlying state offense of child abduc-tion is often not an extraditable offense.
10
There is thus little effective legal process with which to enforce the criminal sanctions
of state law in international child abduction cases.
There is an international civil mechanism relating to these cases, the Hague
Conven tion on International Parental Child Abduction, for which Congress passed imple-
menting legislation in 1988. As a result of this convention, the signatories will recognizethe custody decrees of other signatories, thereby facilitating the return of abducted chil-dren. However, most countries are not signatories to the Convention, thus leavingindividual countries to take whatever legal unilateral action they can to obtain the returnof abducted children.
Creating a federal felony offense responds to these problems in four ways.First, making international parental kidnapping a federal crime provides a direct
basis for the United States to request extradition of the kidnapping parent from thosecountries with which we have extradition treaties.
Second, the federal criminal penalty will deter at least some abductions by ensuring
that the kidnapping offender will be pursued by the United States government. At present,most abducting parents have little to fear with regard to effective pursuit.
Third, the offense will provide the basis for Federal warrants, which will in turn
enhance the force of U.S. diplomatic representations seeking the assistance of foreigngovernments in returning abducted children.
Fourth, enacting such a felony offense will make clear to other nations the gravity with
which the United States views these cases.
BRIEF EXPLANATION OF H.R. 3378
H.R. 3378 adds the offense of international parental kidnapping to title 18, United
States Code.
The offense consists of taking a child from the United States, or keeping outside of the
United States a child who has been in the United States, with intent to obstruct parentalrights. A “child” is a person under 16. “Parental rights” means the right to physical cus-tody of the child, arising from court order, operation of law, or a legally binding agreement.
The bill provides three affirmative defenses: (1) acting under a valid court order, (2)
flight from domestic violence, and (3) circumstances beyond the defendant’s control.
H.R. 3378 also authorizes $250,000 for training and educational programs dealing
with parental child abduction. The funds will be administered by the State Justice Insti-tute in the form of grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts under the State JusticeInstitute Act of 1984.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
A bill to provide penalties for the international parental abduction of children, H.R.
3759, was introduced by Mr. Gekas of Pennsylvania in the 101st Congress. A hearing on the
180FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -bill was held before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on September 27, 1990.11 The bill
was subsequently included, as amended, as Subtitle B, Title XIV , of H.R. 3371, “The Omni-
bus Crime Control Act of 1991,” as reported by the Committee on the Judiciary during the1st Session of the 102d Congress.
12 It was accepted in the conference report on H.R. 3371, the
“Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1991,”13 which was adopted by the
House on November 27, 1991, but was not voted on by the Senate prior to adjournment ofthe 102d Congress sine die.
103d CONGRESS
H.R. 3378 was introduced on October 27, 1993, by Mr. Gekas. Its language is identical to
that of the relevant part of the Conference Report on H.R. 3371 in the 102d Congress.
The Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice reported H.R. 3378 to the Committee
on the Judiciary favorably by voice vote on November 16, 1993.
On November 17, 1993, the Committee on the Judiciary met to consider H.R. 3378. A
reporting quorum being present, the Committee by voice vote ordered H.R. 3378 favorablyreported to the House.
SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS
SECTION 1
Short title: International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993.
SECTION 2(a)
Section 2(a) amends Chapter 55 of title 18 of the United States Code, which governs
kidnapping, by adding a new section at the end, Section 1204 (to be codified at 18 U.S.C.,Section 1204) entitled “International Parental Kidnapping.”
The new Section 1204(a) provides for title 18 fines, or imprisonment for not more than
3 years, or both, for anyone who removes a child from the United States, or keeps outsideof the United States a child who has been in the United States, with the intent of obstruct-ing the lawful exercise of parental rights.
Section 1204(b)(1) defines “child” as a person who has not yet attained the age of 16.Section 1204(b)(2) defines “parental rights” as the right to physical custody of the
child, whether the right is joint or sole, and whether the right arises by operation of law,court order, or legally binding agreement of the parties. These “parental rights” are to bedetermined by reference to State law, in accordance with the Hague Convention on theCivil Aspects of International Parental Child Abduction.
Section 1204(c) provides three affirmative defenses. They are (1) acting within the
provisions of a valid court order obtained pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Juris-diction Act and in effect at the time of the offense; (2) fleeing an incidence or pattern ofdomestic violence; and (3) having physical custody pursuant to a court order but failing toreturn the child because of circumstances beyond the defendant’s control, provided thatthe defendant attempted to notify the lawful custodian within 24 hours after the visitationperiod expired and returned the child as soon as possible.
Section 1204(d) makes clear that nothing in this section is to be construed as detracting
from the provisions of the Hague Convention.
SECTION 2(b)
Section 2(b) expresses the sense of the Congress that, where applicable, the procedures
under the Hague Convention should be the option of first choice of a parent whose childhas been abducted.

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE...
U.S. CONGRESS
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
Washington, DC, November 19, 1993
Hon. JACK BROOKSChairman, Committee on the JudiciaryHouse of Representatives, Washington, DC
Dear Mr. Chairman:
The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed H.R. 3378, the International Parental
Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judi-
ciary on November 17, 1993. CBO estimates that implementation of H.R. 3378 would resultin enforcement costs of $15,000 a year, as well as increases in federal receipts and directspending of less than $500,000 annually. Because this bill would affect receipts and directspending, it would be subject to pay-as-you-go procedures under section 252 of the Bal-anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. In addition, H.R. 3378 wouldauthorize appropriations of $250,000 in fiscal year 1994 for the State Justice Institute toconduct training and educational programs related to child abduction. CBO estimates thatthe bill would impose no costs on state or local governments.
H.R. 3378 would make it a federal offense to remove a child from the United States with
the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights. Enforcing this legislation wouldconsume staff time and other resources of the federal government. Under current law, thefederal government has the authority to assist most states in their pursuit of alleged kid-nappers. Any costs incurred by the federal government are reimbursed by the state thatsought its assistance. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), enactment of this billwould enable the federal government to handle international child abduction cases whereit normally would not be involved because a state could not afford to reimburse the federalgovernment for its assistance. Because most states have been able to provide funding forthis type of assistance when needed, DOJ expects that it only would handle no more thanthree additional cases annually. CBO expects that it would cost DOJ an additional $15,000a year to support this additional caseload.
The bill establishes criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. CBO estimates
that the government would collect less than $500,000 a year in fines, which would berecorded in the budget as governmental receipts, or revenues. The fines would be depos-ited in the Crime Victims Fund and spent in the following year. Thus, enactment of H.R.3378 would affect both receipts and direct spending. Because the increase in direct spend-ing would be the same as the amount of fines collected with a one-year lag, the additionaldirect spending also would be less than $500,000 a year. Therefore, the pay-as-you-goimpact of this bill, with regard to both receipts and direct spending, would be negligible.
If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The
CBO staff contacts are Susanne Mehlman, and Melissa Sampson.
Sincerely,
Robert D. Reischauer, Director....

18 U.S.C. §
 SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE
This title may be cited as the “Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998.”
18 U.S.C. § SEC. 202. FINDINGS
Congress finds that —
(1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a parent in violation of law,
court order, or legally binding agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;
(2) until the mid-1970s, parental abduction generally was not considered a criminal
offense in the United States;
(3) since the mid-1970s, United States criminal law has evolved such that parental
abduction is now a criminal offense in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia;
(4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 (Pub. L.
No. 103-173; 107 Stat. 1998; 18 U.S.C. 1204), Congress recognized the need to combatparental abduction by making the act of international parental kidnapping a Federalcriminal offense;
(5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United States is a party specifically
list the offenses that are extraditable and use the word “kidnapping,” but it has been thepractice of the United States not to consider the term to include parental abductionbecause these treaties were negotiated by the United States prior to the development inUnited States criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and (4);
(6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the United States is a party contain
dual criminality provisions, which provide for extradition where both parties make the
183- FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSEoffense a felony, and therefore it is the practice of the United States to consider such treaties
to include parental abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the act ofparental abduction to be a criminal offense; and
(7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United States extradition law which
should be rectified to better protect the interests of children and their parents.
18 U.S.C. SEC. § 203. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES
For purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United States is a party, Congressauthorizes the interpretation of the terms “kidnaping” and “kidnapping” to includeparental kidnapping.

Application of Certain United States Extradition Treaties to Parental Kidnapping
Summary: On October 31, 1998, President Clinton signed into law the Extradition TreatiesInterpretation Act of 1998 (Title II of Pub. L. No. 105-323). That Act authorizes the interpre-tation of the word “kidnapping” in international extradition treaties of the United Statesto include parental kidnapping. An earlier Federal Register  notice issued by the State
Department’s Legal Adviser reflected a more limited interpretation of the word kidnap-ping in extradition treaties. This Notice explains the change in U.S. policy in this area,including the context of Pub. L. No. 105-323.
EFFECTIVE DATE: October 31, 1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Samuel M. Witten, Office of the Legal Adviser,
Department of State (202-647-7324).
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title II of Pub. L. No. 105-323, the “Extradition Trea-
ties Interpretation Act of 1998,” addresses a unique issue that has arisen in the last twentyyears of U.S. extradition practice. The U.S. Government’s international extradition treatiesnegotiated prior to the late 1970s typically limit extradition to specific listed offenses andinclude the word “kidnapping” in the negotiated lists of those offenses. About 75 of the U.S.Government’s approximately 110 extradition treaty relationships fall in this category of“list” treaties that include the word “kidnapping.”
At the time these list extradition treaties were negotiated, the term “kidnapping” was
generally understood in U.S. criminal law to exclude abductions or wrongful retentions ofminors by their parents. In keeping with this narrow interpretation, on November 24,1976, the State Department Legal Adviser issued a Federal Register notice with a model
“Bilateral Treaty on Mutual Extradition of Fugitives” which included the offense of “kid-napping” in the list of extraditable offenses while simultaneously noting that the modeltreaty would not reach “domestic relations problems such as custody disputes.” See Federal
Register , Vol. 141, No. 228, page 51897. Subsequently, the State Department has not inter-
preted such “list” treaties to permit extradition requests that would have construed theword “kidnapping” to include parental kidnapping.
184FAMILY  ABDUCTION : PREVENTION  AND RESPONSE  -U.S. law on this subject has evolved dramatically since most of these list treaties were
negotiated. Parental kidnappings are now crimes at the federal level (see United States
Code, Title 18, Section 1204), in all of the 50 states, and in the District of Columbia. Both in
the context of abductions and wrongful retention of children from the United States in
violation of these laws and, more generally, in the interest of enhanced international lawenforcement cooperation under our extradition treaties, this narrow interpretationbecame the subject of concern on the part of the U.S. Departments of Justice and State, stateand local prosecutors, and parents who would like the greatest possible flexibility in
dealing with parental kidnapping situations.
In addition, as U.S. extradition practice evolved, the practice of including lists of
extradit able offenses in extradition treaties was gradually abandoned in favor of gener-
ally permitting extradition for any crime that is punishable in both the requesting and
requested States by more than one year’s imprisonment. This advance in treaty practice
made the list treaty situation particularly anomalous because parental kidnapping was
typically an extraditable offense under the modern extradition treaties that rely on “dual
criminality” rather than lists of offenses, so long as the relevant treaty partner has also
criminalized the offense and all other conditions of the treaties are met.
Normally, the interpretation of “list” treaty offenses would simply evolve to reflect the
evolution of new aspects of crimes that are identified in the list treaties. In this instance,
however, the U.S. view had been widely disseminated, including by publication in theFederal Register in 1976, as a fixed policy of the U.S. Government. Therefore, in 1997 the Stateand Justice Departments brought this issue to the attention of the Congress. These
consul tations led to Pub. L. No. 105-323, which addresses the matter by clarifying that
“kidnapping” in extradition list treaties may include parental kidnapping, thus reflecting
the major changes that have occurred in this area of criminal law in the last 20 years. With
this clarification, the Executive Branch is now in a stronger position to make and act uponthe full range of possible extradition requests dealing with parental kidnapping under listtreaties that include the word “kidnapping” on such lists. This will help achieve the goal ofenhancing international law enforcement cooperation in this area. The United States would,however, adopt this broader interpretation only once it has confirmed with respect to a
given treaty that this would be a shared understanding of the parties regarding the inter-
pretation of the treaty in question.
This change in the interpretation of “kidnapping” for purposes of extradition treaties is
entirely unrelated to and would have no effect whatsoever on the use of civil means for the
return of children, in particular under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Inter-
national Parental Child Abduction. It addresses only countries with which we have “list”
extradition treaties and would have no effect with respect to countries with which theUnited States has no extradition relationship or countries where we have a dual criminal-ity treaty.
The adoption of this expanded interpretation with respect to each specific treaty, however,
will depend of course on the views of the other country in question, as the interpretation of
terms in a bilateral treaty must depend on a shared understanding between the twoparties. The United States recognizes that not all countries have criminalized parentalkidnapping, and many continue to treat custody of children as a civil or family law matterthat is not an appropriate subject for criminal action. We also recognize that this is anevolving area of criminal law and that some countries which do not currently criminalize
this conduct may decide to do so in future years. For this reason, we will consult with our
list treaty partners and will adopt the expanded interpretation only where there is a
shared understanding to this effect between the parties.

DUAL NATIONALITY FOR CHILDREN
Many children, born in the U.S. or born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent, are citizens of both the U.S. and another
country. A child may acquire the citizenship of a foreign country, for example, through the child’s birth abroad, or through
a parent. There is no requirement that a U.S. citizen parent consent to a child’s acquisition of another nationality. Theinability of a person to obtain a U.S. passport for a child (for example, because of the “dual-parent signature” requirement)
does not prevent a dual national child from obtaining and traveling on a passport issued by another country.
U.S. law and regulations concerning the issuance of U.S. passports do not apply to foreign governments when they
issue passports to people (including children) who they consider to be citizens of their country, even if the foreign passport
is issued in the United States and/or to a person the United States considers to be a U.S. citizen. If you think there is apossibility that your child may have another nationality, you are encouraged to contact the relevant country’s embassy orconsulate directly to inquire about the rules governing the issuance of that country’s passport to your child, including thepossible availability of mechanisms to prevent the issuance to your child of that country’s passport without your consent.The addresses and telephone numbers for the embassies and consulates of foreign countries in the United States arelisted on the Consular Affairs Internet web page at: >>http://travel.state.gov<< under Foreign Entry Requirements. TheU.S. Department of State encourages you to send the Office of Children’s issues a copy of any written inquiry in thisrespect you make to a foreign embassy or consulate.
PRIVACY ACT ST ATEMENT
The information solicited on this form is requested pursuant to provisions in Titles 8 and 22 of the U.S. Code, whether or
not codified, as well as the corresponding federal regulations, including specifically 22 U.S.C. 211a and Section 236 ofthe Admiral James W.

Failure to complete the formmay result in a passport being issued to your child without your knowledge.

*IMPORTANT*:  If there is no applicable court order, please provide a copy of the state
statute, case law, or an affidavit of law prepared by an attorney that establishes your right
of custody at the time of the child’s removal. This provision of the law may sometimes befound in the estate and wills section of the state code. Remember, you are not attemptingto show that you would have an equal right to obtain custody in a subsequent custodyproceeding, but that you had and were exercising a right of custody when the child was
taken.  SEND IN YOUR HAGUE APPLICATION IMMEDIATELY. Do NOT wait to get an
order of custody. Orders issued after removal/retention are irrelevant in aHague hearing.
