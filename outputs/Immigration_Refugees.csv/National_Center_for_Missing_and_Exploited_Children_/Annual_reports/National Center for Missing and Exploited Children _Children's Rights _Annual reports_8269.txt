A Message 
from 
the CEODear Friends,
It’s been a challenging year for everyone, and 
I’m proud to say that our dedicated employees 
found innovative ways to help missing and 
sexually exploited children 24/7 despite COVID-19 
restrictions and lockdowns. When schools 
were shuttered and children were spending 
significantly more time online, we stepped up 
our prevention efforts, warning and educating 
families about dangers lurking on the internet. 
The surge in screen times took a devastating toll on 
children this year, as reports of online enticement 
skyrocketed. During the height of the pandemic, our 
CyberTipline received 37,872 reports of suspected 
enticement compared to 19,174 last year – a 
97.5% increase. Enticement occurs when a person 
communicates online with someone they believe 
to be a child with the intent of committing a sexual 
offense or abduction. We also saw child sex traffickers 
leverage new business models to profit from child 
sexual exploitation in which they navigated face 
mask and social distancing rules by making sexual 
abuse content available for purchase online.
As the country was in lockdown, we assisted 
our federal partner, The U.S. Marshals Service, 
in operations across the country that led to the 
recovery of nearly 400 missing children. We 
commend their success. The fortuitous timing 
of our launch of NCMEC CONNECT, our new 
virtual gateway to trainings, resources and best 
practices, allowed us to continue sharing online 
the knowledge we’ve gleaned over 37 years 
as the nation’s leading nonprofit organization 
for missing and sexually exploited children.
All of us at NCMEC, along with our Board of 
Directors, were deeply moved that, despite economic 
uncertainty, our donors and corporate partners 
continued their generous support of our mission 
to help find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization. Holding 
our premier fundraising events virtually this year, 
notably “HOPE Live,” gave survivors a much wider 
audience for their messages of hope and enabled 
us to showcase all that NCMEC can do to help.
We’re now facing one of the biggest challenges in 
our 37 years, and I can’t overstate this: We’re in 
danger of losing the global battle for child safety. 
Despite our best efforts for a compromise, European 
Union (EU) regulations went into effect at the end 
of this year that infringe on tech companies’ ability 
to use scanning technology to detect, report and 
remove online child sexual abuse material, which 
comprised the vast majority of the record 21.7 
million CyberTipline reports we received this year.
We’ve warned legislators in the EU and in this 
country in stark terms that these regulations 
would literally blind the world to reports of 
online sexual abuse of children relating to the 
EU. Since its enactment, we’ve already seen 
some of our worst fears realized with reports 
relating to the EU plummeting. Law enforcement 
can’t rescue children if they can’t find them.
I’d like to personally thank our donors and 
corporate partners for their unwavering support 
during this trying time in America. For those who 
truly want to make a difference, please consider 
joining us in our mission. There’s nothing more 
fulfilling than helping children every single day.
Regards,  
John F. Clark, President and CEO
