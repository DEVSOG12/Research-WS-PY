A Message 
from 
the CEODear Friends,
Despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we 
have so much to be proud of this year: Our dedicated 
employees helped law enforcement recover 28,872 
missing children and handled a record number of 
reports of suspected child sexual exploitation – more 
than 29 million – to our CyberTipline. They engaged 
the public like never before on social media and 
helped families navigate dangers on the internet as 
their children spent significantly more time online.
The pandemic restrictions did not deter our non-
profit organization from fulfilling its mission to help 
find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation 
and prevent child victimization. In fact, we helped 
more children and families this year than at any time 
in our 37-year history. In addition, we’ve launched 
new initiatives to help underserved communities, 
including child sex trafficking survivors and children 
in Native, Indigenous and Tribal communities.
Our CyberTipline, the designated place in the U.S. to 
report suspected child sexual exploitation, surpassed 
a daunting new milestone this year: 100 million 
reports, nearly all related to images and videos of 
children being sexually abused that are circulating 
on the internet around the world. With help from 
our technology partners, however, we’ve made 
enormous strides helping law enforcement disrupt 
the distribution of these images and videos and 
recover the children in them and stop the abuse.
With the surge in screen times, we’ve seen a 
dramatic increase in reports of online enticement of 
children – from 19,174 before Covid-19 restrictions 
were implemented to 44,155 this year.  In response, 
we’ve stepped up our prevention efforts, educating 
parents about online predators who try to entice 
children for abuse, including sexually explicit 
photos or to meet for sexual purposes. We 
launched our second season of “Into the Cloud,” 
our popular animated NetSmartz series which provides important internet safety information in 
an age-appropriate and entertaining manner. It’s 
already reached 3.6 million students and families.
With our ever-expanding online presence, our 
overall reach this year across social media was 
more than 80 million people. We have nearly 1.9 
million followers across our platforms on Facebook, 
Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok. We’ve 
harnessed the power of social media to help 
find missing children, raise money and inform 
the public about our issues and free resources 
through our videos, missing posters and blogs.
I’d like to personally thank the many individuals, 
corporations, foundations and other donors who 
chose to invest in us this year, contributing more 
than $8.4 million for the children and families 
we serve. Despite economic uncertainty, this 
has been an outstanding year for philanthropy, 
with fundraising surpassing our goals.
We simply could not do all that we do without your 
financial support, including your help with our signature 
fundraising events, Hope Live and Miles for Hope.
On a personal note, I’ve had the privilege of leading 
this non-profit organization for more than six years, 
and I notified the Board of Directors that I’d be 
stepping down in spring 2022. I can’t overstate what 
an honor it’s been to serve this great organization 
and witness the impact our dedicated employees 
have every single day on the lives of children in this 
country and around the world. They could not do 
all that they do without your generous support.
Regards, 
John F. Clark, President and CEO 
National Center for Missing & Exploited Children2
