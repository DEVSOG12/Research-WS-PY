Wilson Family FoundationThis year, we’ve been facing one of the biggest challenges in our 35-year history, 
and I want to thank you for standing by our side as we work to protect our country’s 
most valuable resource – our kids. In response to growing concerns about online 
data security, many technology companies are adopting a strategy called end-to-
end encryption that could have dire consequences for millions of children being 
sexually abused and having horrific images of their abuse shared online.
We’ve received more than 61 million reports since 1998 to our CyberTipline of 
suspected child sexual abuse material, online enticement, child sex trafficking, 
child sexual molestation and other crimes, including more than 16.9 million reports 
this year alone. With end-to-end encryption, we estimate more than half of these 
reports would simply vanish, never making it into the hands of law enforcement.
End-to-end encryption would provide data security but, in the process, also prevent 
technology companies or any third party from detecting sexual abuse of children occurring 
on their platforms. Access to information about these crimes through our CyberTipline is 
often the only way for law enforcement to know they’re happening and rescue the children. This passionate privacy debate has awakened the nation to what we see 
at NCMEC everyday: an explosion in child sexual exploitation on the 
internet. The Justice Department held a summit this year on the issue, 
new laws are being debated and survivors have added their voices.
Just as it has developed innovative ways to help sexually exploited and 
missing children, we’re calling on the technology industry to implement 
solutions that enhance consumer privacy while prioritizing child safety.
Every day, I attend meetings with my staff to discuss issues like end-to-
end encryption and its impact on our children’s safety. I’m grateful for your 
support because it allows us to speak up for children and to fight to make 
sure our country is a safer place for them to learn, play and grow.
