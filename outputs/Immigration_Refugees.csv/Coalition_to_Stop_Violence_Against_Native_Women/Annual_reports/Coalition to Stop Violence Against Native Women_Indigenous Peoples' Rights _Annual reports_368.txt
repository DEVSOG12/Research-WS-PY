2016 IMPACT REPORTCelebrating two decades of service 
to New Mexico tribal communities!
2016 marked 20 years of service to New Mexico tribal communities. 20 years of building a broad and unified movement that works to 
end violence against Native women and children. Today, CSVANW is at the forefront of a dynamic approach to the tribal domestic and sexual violence prevention movement. We are sourcing the most effective, creative and innovative ways to address and prevent the cycle of violence against our women and children. Across the region we have mobilized hundreds of Native people to become a part of a strong network who advocate for better services, response and community-based programming.  
For 20 years, the Coalition has provided critical training, policy advocacy resources to tribal leaders, top federal and state officials, 
service providers, tribal law enforcement, victims, as well as those who prosecute violent offenders.
MISSION  
To stop violence against Native 
women and children by advocating for social change.
