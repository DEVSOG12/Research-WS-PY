It is critical to work towards inclusive advocacy.LGBTQ2S+ survivors of violence experience the same rates of violence as other intimate partner relationships- however, LGBT survivors sometimes face discrimination (whether intentional or not) when seeking help and protection. These discriminations can re-victimized and/or re-traumatize an individual. Although VAWA 2013 prohibits such discrimination to ensure that all victims of violence have access to the same services and protection to overcome trauma and find safety.Glossary of TermsGay: a man who is attracted to men.Lesbian: a woman who is attracted to women.Straight: a man who is exclusively attracted to women or a woman who is exclusively attracted to men.Bi-sexual: individuals who are attracted to people of one’s own gender and people of other gender(s).Pansexual: individuals who are attracted to people regardless of gender.Queer: similar to pansexual, queer individuals can be an identity label meaning that a person is attracted to people of many genders.Asexual: individuals who are not sexually attracted to anyone and/or not acting on attraction to anyone.
