Brian Nelson, in written testimony, testifies to his 12 years in Tamms Correctional Center, a supermax prison in Illinois.  Nelson, transferred from a minimum security prison in New Mexico, describes a harrowing experience of prison isolation and the significantly detrimental effects on his health and well-being. Tamms has recently been in the news for a contentious debate over its closure; this week, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn announced its  closure by August 31st.

I lost hope, even though I was scheduled to be released in a couple years. Depression overwhelmed me. Then a lawsuit as filed over the treatment of inmates with serious mental illness not being properly treated  at Tamms. I was named in that suit. In reply, Tamms mental health employees began to harass me and started placing me on suicide watches for no reason. I was given the Minnesota Multi Personality Test. When the results came back, the head psychologist called me to the infirmary had me locked in a bathroom and screamed at me that I was making her look bad. She then ordered officers to strip me naked–which they did leaving me locked on the bathroom for approximately 10 hours. The psychologist then ordered that my medication be immediately stoped. As part of the case, our lawyer arranged for two doctors to come into Tamms to evaluate me–Dr. Kathryn Burns and Dr. Terry Kupers. Both doctors confirmed that I was severely depressed and the conditions at Tamms exacerbated the depression. Both found that I was actively suicidal. Even though Drs. Burns and Kupers are experts on the conditions of supermax prisons, the Tamm’ psychologist refused to initiate any of the therapy they proposed. I got worse. Another serious suicide attempt followed and I lost so much weight that the Deputy Director, after seeing me in the holding cell, ordered that some sort of treatment be started, and immediately had me weighed. I weighed 119 lbs. All the boned in my body protruded. I shuffled instead of walked. I had no appetite and wanted to die.Everyday I went to sleep I got down on my knees and prayed that I would die in my sleep, yet God’s will was not mine. When I woke up in the night I prayed harder for death. I couldn’t sleep, and during thos period got no more than 16 hours of sleep a week. I went days pacing back and forth like a zombie (a condition now recognized as a sign of severe mental illness when exhibited by animals in zoos–but apparently its okay when people suffer this way). I looked like I was already dead and I had no will to live. Day after day all I saw was gray walls and over time my world became the gray box. I fought hard with my own mind, and I prayed. I copies the Catholic Bible word for word which took me 1 year 9 months and 2 days. I copied the Rule of St. Benedict 3 times and studied with Cisterician Monks and Priests. I watched a friend give up and kill himself at Tamms. Sadly, several minutes before he died, he told the nurse and mental health worker that he was going to commit suicide. They just didn’t care and walked away. Marcus Chapman was finally released from the gray box in a black body bag on August 24, 2005.He concludes his testimony with the following:I spent 12 years in solitary confinement and I was never told why I was placed in solitary. I am a human being and every day I still struggle with the trauma being held in that gray box. I wake screaming at night. I can’ get it out of my head some days. Solitary confinement in my opinion is worse than being beaten. That I spent twelve years in such conditions in America is appalling.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesVoices from SolitaryTagsIllinois,Mental Illness,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Supermax PrisonsVoices from SolitaryThe Voices from Solitary series publishes dispatches from people surviving the lived experience of solitary confinement.Help Expose the Hidden World of Solitary ConfinementAccurate information and authentic storytelling can serve as powerful antidotes to ignorance and injustice.

You guys who think this is inhumane need to take a couple of history classes. You guys = The suck!Replyrichard romaJuly 15, 2014 at 11:16 amThis article doesnt mention that Brian Nelson or “Mouse” as he was known on the streets was the alleged leader of the Simon City Royals gang, which has thousands of members nationwide and is involved in drug dealing, murder, robbery, assault etc. theyre big in chicago, milwaukee, florida, tennessee, misssisippi etc. This guy is/was not just some unlucky kid, he was a major gangster, look it up for yourself.Not saying that the treatment described isn;t inhumane, but if the people who wrote this are willing to omit such important info to get you on their side, theyre probably not to be trusted about anything else they sayReplyConnie VelezFebruary 26, 2014 at 1:40 amSmh…Wake up America !!!This is a Gigantic Moral Concern!!♥ReplyConnie VelezFebruary 25, 2014 at 9:49 pmNo.. Bueno These Beasts are Killing prisonersHarshly. WAKE UP AMERICA!! THIS IS A GIGANTIC MORAL CONCERN!!ReplyBelinda BelcherSeptember 11, 2012 at 11:42 pmThere are people who are in prisons who should be. The men that have suffered the harm of being in long term isolation arenot affforded any opppunitiies and have no “given” chance at a a life. They work hard, they fight hard to have whatever life they have. To say that it is not torture is is not only a lie but an a total lie to me–a taxpayer and advisor to those who are incarcerated. WHY do these places still operate? Money. What is more important money v. human lifeReply8foreverSeptember 12, 2012 at 12:22 pm@Belinda yep Money is the most important thing each of these human beings represent a pay check to someone Isolation costs more, and certainly people that break the law should be in prison but again I say torture was never supposed to be part of imprisonment. These places are not only still operating but still growing Obama okayed at least 2 more super maxes last year. I have recently felt defeated and intended to step back from the issue; The futilityatof watching and being part of the lives of those suffering made me want to quit then I read the BOP director Samuelssent of all things a memo to those in seg saying in part”dont lose hope” Um I wrote him too. My letters are always respectful but never acknowledged. Thank you for the post I still feel theres no hope.Talking and doing just need to be more doing…. Right?ReplyTim HurleyJune 28, 2012 at 1:30 pmDoes it really matter Caree?Reply#8 foreverJune 29, 2012 at 10:24 amExactly Tim people should go to prison for a crime but we as Americans have a right to not be tortured.ReplyCareeJune 25, 2012 at 12:45 pmWhy were they in prison in the first place?ReplyRoseJune 24, 2012 at 3:24 pmHebrews 13:3(NIV)Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.Reply#8 foreverJune 24, 2012 at 2:54 pmI have heard so many stories this one I cried I only have questions but no one to ask. and these fiends drawing a paycheck for doing these things blows my mind.I dream of it all ending and these employees being hunted down like Nazi war criminals the “psychologist in this story should be before a firing squad stripped naked.Replycuri56June 24, 2012 at 2:51 pmReblogged this on http://www.HumansinShadow.wordpress.com/.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
