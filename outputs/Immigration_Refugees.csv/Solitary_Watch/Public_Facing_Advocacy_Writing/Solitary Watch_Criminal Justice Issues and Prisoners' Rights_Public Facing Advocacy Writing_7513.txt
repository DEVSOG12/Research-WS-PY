According to his stepfather, Trujillo has spent his time in prison seeking “to expand his knowledge and his quest for spiritual enlightenment.” In his piece, a rap entitled “Dare to Think,” Trujillo writes that his mind “remains free.”  He can be reached by writing: Timothy Trujillo, P32319, Pelican Bay State Prison, P.O.
