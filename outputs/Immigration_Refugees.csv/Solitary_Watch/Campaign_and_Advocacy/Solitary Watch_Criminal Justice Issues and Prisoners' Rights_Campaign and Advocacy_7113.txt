People who go to jail have demonstrated that they have a problem adjusting to the laws of our society, if they are not treated properly more likely they will come out worse and be even more destructive to our communities. It should be the intentions of correction to help the inmates not make them worse which is what happens when a person is placed in solitary confinement.ReplyRobin KeebleJune 11, 2012 at 12:30 amSolitary confinement has a well documented negative impact on mental health and wellbeing and may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, particularly when used for a prolonged timeThere is unequivocal evidence that solitary confinement has a profound impact on health and wellbeing, particularly for those with pre-existing mental health disorders, and that it may also actively cause mental illness. The extent of psychological damage varies and will depend on individual factors (e.g. personal background and pre-existing health problems), environmental factors (e.g. physical conditions and provisions), regime (e.g. time out of cell, degree of human contact), the context of isolation (e.g. punishment, own protection, voluntary/ non voluntary, political/criminal) and its duration.There is remarkable consistency in research findings on the health effects of solitary confinement throughout the decades. These have mostly demonstrated negative health effects, with studies reporting no negative effects being few and far between, and virtually no study reporting positive effects.It is imperative that consideration of the vast amount of research on this practice be reviewed in determining continued use. Additionally, an in-depth understanding of the impact on the communities to which they return must be taken into account, as 90% of them return with limited support of successful transition.http://solitaryconfinement.org/uploads/sourcebook_web.pdfReplyJoanie RJune 9, 2012 at 2:28 pmThis is so inhumane when I was locked in a single cell I was fed a small breakfast, soup for lunch and left over dinner from chow that was ground into what we called “Mystery Mounds” or “Buffalo Balls” They were so bad nobody could eat it. I had lost 20 pds. in 3 weeks. My bed roll was taken away at 6am for weeks at a time to only be returned in the evening hours. The practice of soliatry confinement needs to stop. Showers were only every other day only when the CO felt like it some times a week would go by and I had gall stones it took them a month to take me only cuz someone felt compassion for me to get me to the hospital. Thank God my stones were going gang grenous…. I was left for dead and I was in a M.O. cell. Medical Observation Cell and stayed in the hospital 3 weeks for the surgery. Such a rotten place to be left in a cell sick with no attention….ReplyCindi MarshallJune 9, 2012 at 3:14 amWhen I was placed in SHU as a 21 yr. old it have a very big impact on my life…I was to be placed in the hole but because of overflow they put me in the SMU for SHU overflow.They had placed me with some who were witches and were satanic, something I will never forget.But the reality of the stay was no mattress, cememnt floors, food that was mush and was not worthy of being called food.Treated like animals, very demeaning and disrespectful.If you didnt have a very strong mind and heart I can see how this can effect a being for the rest of their lives.To have negativity towards anyone or thing.This SHU/SMU is inhumane and should be stopped.Of course if you are medically ill I believe they should be housed differently unless the prison made them like that.ReplySandy BealsJune 9, 2012 at 1:05 amPraying for reform, and for “the powers that be”,listen and make changes.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)June 9, 2012 at 1:02 amI will definitely write my viewpoint as a former deputy warden in a Special Management Unit in Florence and identify and address issues that I think are detrimental and contributory to the demise of human beings locked away for prolonged periods of time and held under conditions that are not constitutionally sound in my honest opinion as a former correctional administrator now having the opportunity to witness, observe, react and understand the elements of solitary confinement.I hope all family members will take the time to write how this concept has impacted their loved ones and how they have been treated and changed over the years of incarceration inside a SHU or SMU.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)June 8, 2012 at 5:52 pmNow is the time for all good men and women to take a step forward and share their experiences in solitary confinement with Congress. Don’t be shy, every word written or said is another stepping stone to a better and more focused picture of this practice that has long term effects when abused.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
