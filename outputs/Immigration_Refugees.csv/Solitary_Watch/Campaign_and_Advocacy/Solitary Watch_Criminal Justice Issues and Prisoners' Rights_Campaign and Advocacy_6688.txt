Also published was a list of the best reporting on solitary, including Solitary Watch’s “Voices from Solitary.”• Human Rights Watch released a report about the conditions experienced by transgender women held in immigration detention. Half of the women interviewed by HRW had spent time in solitary confinement, allegedly for their own protection.
