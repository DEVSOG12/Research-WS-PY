Released from prison in 2012, he has gone on to become an activist against solitary and mass incarceration and founder of the Incarcerated Nation Corporation, which aids and organizes formerly incarcerated individuals.Eyewitnesses say that Mualimm-ak and veteran activist Joseph “Jazz” Hayden, who had attended the event, were leaving the OSF building on West 57th Street when they saw police officers confronting a homeless man. Hayden began filming the encounter and was arrested. Mualimm-ak protested Hayden’s arrest, and was arrested as well.The two men were taken to the nearby Midtown North Precinct and placed in the cells. Five individuals who had attended the launch event walked to the precinct to inquire after their welfare. Shortly after arriving, they were arrested as well, handcuffed, detained, and finally released after being charged with “refusal to disperse.”In the early hours of the morning, Mualimm-ak and Hayden were sent from the precinct to Central Booking in Lower Manhattan. They have been charged with Obstruction of Government Administration and are expected to be arraigned today at approximately 2 pm, in New York County Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street. They have legal representation from the National Lawyers Guild.More details will be provided as they emerge, here and on Solitary Watch’s social media feeds.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsarrests,Five Mualimm-ak,Hell Is a Very Small Place,Jazz Hayden,NYPDJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

However, it is very impressive that the police who initially responded to the man who was homeless and having a hard time responded calmly, compassionately, and using de-escalating approaches.I hope that Mr. Mualimm-ak and Mr. Hayden, as well as other activists who came to inquire about what they were being charged with, will be cleared of all charges. I also hope that as a community we can work to address the systemic racism in our culture that sometimes makes real change very challenging. It is sad that some police found Mr. Mualimm-ak and Mr. Hayden somehow threatening when they were simply trying to help.We need to be able to trust that police will behave in calm, thoughtful, and balanced ways. Evidence of police responding to people based on racist attitudes is very problematic. We need to address this issue much more passionately as a community.ReplyshannondocheffMarch 17, 2016 at 8:27 pmWhat can we do about this?ReplyJean Casella and James RidgewayMarch 18, 2016 at 2:40 pmFive and Jazz have excellent attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild.

We have see dozens and dozens of films of police actions on TV and the people who filmed them are not in jail. Personally, I am thankful for police and grateful for their protection, but lets hear the whole story and not put people in jail for filming an incident. I doubt seriously that they were obstructing the role of justice.ReplyebeprimeMarch 16, 2016 at 7:25 pmSmh don’t believe everything you read..ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
