Among other things, the bill would prohibit the placement of people with mental illness in solitary confinement and require the Office of Inspector General to conduct regular reviews of all individuals serving indeterminate SHU terms.• In their latest piece, the Juvenile Justice Information Exchange examine the “growing number of states moving away from juvenile solitary confinement”.• Writing for VICE, Annie Waldman explores America’s “Little Guantanamos” – the two Communication Management Units (CMUs) currently operating out of federal prisons. About 70% of those placed in CMUs are Muslim.  People incarcerated in CMUs face very strict limitations on their communication with the outside world, so much so that the units have been called an “experiment in social isolation” by the Center for Constitutional Rights.• Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal – three Americans who endured many months of solitary confinement in Iran after being captured hiking near the Iraq-Iran border – have released a memoir detailing their experiences, “A Sliver of Light”.  The team was interviewed by several outlets, including The Guardian, MSNCB and Democracy Now, and spoke out not only about their own experiences but the plight faced by the tens of thousands of individuals held in solitary confinement across the United States.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,Center for Investigative Reporting,Communication Management Unit,Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice,Juvenile Justice Information Exchange,Loni Hancock,Sarah Shourd,Shane Bauer,Solitary Confinement,TexasAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
