His client, Jermaine Gotham, is 16.• Slate published a short film about solitary confinement. “Filmmaker Cali Bondad and reporter Gabrielle Canon spoke to some of the men at supermax Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California about their experiences in solitary. ‘It’s not to the point where you want to commit suicide,’ says one prisoner, before breaking down into tears and admitting there are times that he wishes he had received the death penalty.”• The New York Times published an editorial supporting the recently-announced plans to move 16 and 17-year-olds off Rikers Island to a dedicated jail in the Bronx. Many young people have spent long periods of time in isolation on Rikers Island, including Kalief Browder, whose experiences of solitary at the jail – and eventual suicide – brought the issue onto the national stage.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Auburn County Jail,Center for American Progress,children,disabilities,Mandela Rules,Pelican Bay State Prison,Riker's,United NationsAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
