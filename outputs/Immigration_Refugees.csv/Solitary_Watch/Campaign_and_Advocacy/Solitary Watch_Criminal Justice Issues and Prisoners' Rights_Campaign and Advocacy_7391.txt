Supporters of the Scott sisters have long tried to draw attention to their case, as an extreme example of the distorted justice and Draconian sentencing policies that have overloaded prisons, crippled state budgets, and torn families apart across the United States. But in recent months, their cause has taken on a new urgency, because for Jamie Scott, an unwarranted life sentence may soon become a death sentence.Jamie Scott, now spending her 16th year in prison.Jamie Scott, 38, is suffering from kidney failure. At the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility (CMCF) in Pearl, where Jamie and Gladys are incarcerated, medical services are provided by a private contractor called Wexford Health Sources, which has been the subject of lawsuits and legislative investigations in several states over inadequate treatment of the inmates in its care. According to Jamie Scott’s family, in the six weeks since her condition became life-threatening, she has endured faulty or missed dialysis sessions, infections, and other complications. She has received no indication that a kidney transplant is being considered as an option, though her sister is a willing donor.Jamie Scott’s family and legal advisors believe the poor health care she is receiving in prison places her life at risk. They have sent pleas for clemency or compassionate release to Governor Haley Barbour, whose tough-on-crime posturing and dubious record on issuing pardons do not bode well for Jamie. According to a local television station that reported on the rally at the capitol, a spokesperson for Barbour said: “Jamie Scott was tried, convicted and incarcerated, and she is receiving her care with the Department of Corrections.”The Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) has a provision for what it calls “conditional medical release,” but Scott is not a candidate, department spokesperson Suzanne Garbo Singletary said in an email last week, because “MDOC policy provides that an inmate must have a condition that is ‘incapacitating, totally disabling and/or terminal in nature’ in order to qualify.” So Jamie Scott appears to be caught in a deadly Catch-22: In order to be released from prison, she must convince the MDOC that her illness is terminal or “totally disabling”; but the only sure way for her to prove this is to die in prison.[READ THE FULL ARTICLE HERE]ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCentral Mississippi Correctional Facility,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,compassionate release,Cost/Budget Issues,Evelyn Rasco,Gladys Scott,Haley Barbour,Jamie Scott,MDOC,Mississippi,Mississippi Department of Corrections,Politics of Punishment,Prison Health Care,Private Corrections Working Group,Private Prisons,Race,Scott sisters,Sentencing,Solitary Confinement,Wexford Health SourcesJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

She is in tremendous pain & very weak. Please contact the governor and commissioner to release her from the horrible conditions she is in & the poor medical care that she is receiving. GOV.

It could take the form of mental illness or suicide brought on by the isolation, the contraction of incurable diseases such as aids, or hepatitis contracted when raped amongst other means, or just the death of ones spirit. Prison’s affects are unpredictable but predictable negative.California man gets eight years for stealing cheese Robert Ferguson was sentenced under the ‘three strikes’ law, as critics again plea for reform of state’s overcrowded prisonsCalifornia man gets eight years for stealing cheeseRobert Ferguson was sentenced under the ‘three strikes’ law, as critics again plea for reform of state’s overcrowded prisonsWednesday 3 March 2010The GuardianDaniel NasawA California man has been sentenced to up to eight years in prison for stealing a $3.99 (£2.60) bag of shredded cheese in a case critics say shows the need for reform of the state’s criminal justice system and the overcrowded state of its prisons.http://realcostofprisons.org/blog/archives/2010/03/california_man.html#moreReplyRev. Alan LairdMarch 5, 2010 at 8:54 amIt is bone chilling to the spirit to have knowledge of Jamie’s state of condition, and also having the knowledge that there are so many suffering in the same way. It would seem law was created to protect,and preserve,and not to mete out treacherous justice. We must somehow find a way to once again extract a grain of salt from the sea of humility…compassion….and agape love…not confined in religousity…but the infinite domain of spirituality and humand kindness.,,,ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
