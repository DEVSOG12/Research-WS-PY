I got to know CVT at a gathering – counselors came to talk to us; they did a sensitization. They said they wanted people to have counseling sessions, and said those who were interested should come.I wanted to get rid of those thoughts, those intrusive memories. I always remember one thing they said to me about what I was feeling: “That should not be your life. We have a way out of that situation.”So I came and did the forms and then came for sessions. One session was so good – it changed my life: it’s called the River of Life. They said life goes like a river – there are difficult times and smooth times when it flows. They said to put a stone on the river for the difficult times, and put a flower when it’s smooth. This touched me so much.After coming to CVT, now I feel that if I have difficulties, I have ways to take care of myself. For example, if I have trouble breathing when I’m working in the garden, I know what to do.I was a person who had a lot of anger. I felt angry all the time. When something happened, I hung onto it – I would keep a close hold of it. But after sessions I let go of it.I let go of the hurt I have because I realize this is not my future. This is not my life.My life has changed. Right now I love people. I like to stay around people. I socialize. I can talk to someone who is feeling sad. I listen and help them with their problems. I find I am able to impact people’s lives.From the first session I realized the sessions worked to change me. I realized my life was not useless.If you’re undergoing a difficult situation, I want you to know you are able to overcome this. I wish others could come to get the same kind of care – to know what can be changed. To know this is not the end of the world.You are still capable of living a better life.Name has been changed for security and confidentiality purposes.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
