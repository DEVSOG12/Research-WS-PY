One day while riding alone on a motorbike near his village, he was arrested at a checkpoint and held for 40 days. His fingernails were removed with pliers, which caused him to lose sensation in his fingers. His interrogators cursed at him, insulted him and drilled a hole into his leg with a power drill; he passed out from the pain. When he was released, he had lost 40 kilos (88 pounds) and his wife didn’t even recognize him.Hassan went through the interdisciplinary program of care at CVT Jordan and took the steps he needed to rebuild his life. Hassan wants his experience to be used to help others, so he stepped up to tell his story publicly and show the truth about the war in Syria. *Name and some details have been changed to protect anonymity.CVT’s work in Jordan is made possible with funding from the US State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and the United States Agency for International Development/World Learning and the American people’s support, and Open Society Foundation.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
