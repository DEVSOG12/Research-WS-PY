He confessed to the torturers that he had attended a demonstration in the early days of the revolution in Syria, thinking that would end the torture. It did not. He was put in a tire and beaten and electrocuted. Qassem told CVT he considered himself fortunate because only one of his fingernails was removed; many of his fellow prisoners had all of their nails removed.Transferred to a local prison in Homs, Qassem spent six months suffering sexual and psychological humiliation, being stripped naked and forced eat on his knees with his hands behind his back. After languishing for months, Qassem was finally released when a prison official recognized him and alerted his family. The judge who finally released him told him to leave Syria immediately. Qassem and his family fled, seeking refuge in Jordan. Qasssem came to CVT seeking rehabilitative care for the problems he was having as a result of his torture. He went through the healing cycle and then decided he wanted to share his story. Qassem did not want others to have to suffer what he had survived.  *Name and some details have been changed for safety and to protect confidentiality.Photo credit: Dreamstime. Funding for CVT’s work in Jordan is provided by the United States Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.Who We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
