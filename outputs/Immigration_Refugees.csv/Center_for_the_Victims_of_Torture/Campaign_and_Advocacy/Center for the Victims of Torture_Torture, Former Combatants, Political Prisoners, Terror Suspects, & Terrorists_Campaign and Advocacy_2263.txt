Now, I sleep in complete comfort without using any sedatives.”Rahim is a 49-year-old refugee from Iraq. In 2010, he was kidnapped for a month. After fleeing with his family to Jordan, the effects of his torture became more pronounced. He suffered depression and nightmares. He felt constant back pain and numbness in his leg.Rahim was referred to CVT where he received counselling and physical therapy. Through individual physical therapy sessions, Rahim said his severe pain was reduced by 80 percent. He recovered a range of motion, including standing up after sitting on the floor, walking and performing the Islamic prayer without having to sit on a chair.Rahim is in a better mood and his relations with others improved significantly. And he sleeps comfortably.CVT’s work in Jordan is made possible with funding from the US State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and Open Society Foundation.Photo: Ashley Jonathon ClementsThe names of survivors and some personal details have been changed to protect their identity.
