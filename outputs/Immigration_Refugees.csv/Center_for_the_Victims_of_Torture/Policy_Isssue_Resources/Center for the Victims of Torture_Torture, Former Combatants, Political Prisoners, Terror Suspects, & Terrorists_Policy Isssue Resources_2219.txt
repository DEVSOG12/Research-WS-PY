Progress was made, but vigilance is required and important work remains to be done.Here are steps CVT has taken to push back against the legacy of torture by the U.S.THE TRUTH MATTERS – CIA Torture ProgramIn the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the CIA built a torture program, holding more than one hundred Muslim men captive in secret “black site” prisons around the world and subjecting them to abuses that many Americans rightly associate with foreign dictators, tyrants and terrorists. The torture program had profound consequences for its victims, for U.S. national security, and for the United States’ reputation in the world.In November, 2019, Amazon studios released The Report – a film that tells the story of the work of Senator Dianne Feinstein and a team of Senate intelligence committee staff, led by Daniel J. Jones, which conducted an in-depth investigation into the CIA torture program. Jones and his team—principally Evan Gottesman, Alissa Starzak, and Chad Tanner—wrote a 6,700 page oversight report, 525 pages of which were released publicly, in redacted form, in late 2014. The rest remains classified.The grim realities of the CIA torture program must build support for actions to ensure it never happens again, including—at minimum—declassifying and releasing the full report and excluding from government those who were complicit in torture.

They write that “. . . unlike the efforts at Nuremberg, which marked the birth of international criminal law, the United States decided that power – the power to hide criminal abuse of detainees and fair trial violations – would subjugate reason and the rule of law at Guantanamo. It is for that reason that the 9/11 case has not yet gone to trial, and on that basis that detainee counsel are asking that the case be dismissed.”Op Ed Article: "Course Correction Still Needed on Anti-Torture Obligations”Aug. 9, 2021Scott Roehm, Washington director, and David Luban, Georgetown Law professor, co-authored this article in Just Security titled: “They address concerns that the government has made only a partial retreat from the use of torture-derived evidence, writing, “No more caveats, qualifications, or half-measures.

"It's an equally big deal in its potential much broader application to other torture survivors at Guantanamo."Article: Guantanamo’s COVID-19 Precautions Must Safeguard Detainees’ RightsMar. 31, 2020As COVID-19 expands its reach, Scott Roehm, CVT director of the Washington DC office, writes “. . . the virus’ local presence, coupled with certain measures that the Defense Department is undertaking to prevent a larger outbreak, endanger both the detainees and the already limited rights they have been afforded.” Read his article in Just Security.Letter:  Action Required for Guantanamo DetaineeMar. 31, 2020CVT and Physicians for Human Rights wrote this letter to Defense Secretary Esper urging immediate action in connection with the deteriorating health of one detainee at Guantanamo Bay prison.On Sept. 10, 2019, human rights, civil liberties and faith groups joined CVT in a letter to Defense Secretary Esper, expressing grave concern regarding detainee Sharqawi Al Hajj, who attempted suicide at Guantanamo Bay prison.REPORT: Deprivation and Despair: The Crisis of Medical Care at GuantánamoOn June 26, 2019, CVT and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) launched this joint report detailing widespread medical deficiencies at the Guantánamo Bay detention center. Read the press release and landing page for the report and associated supporting documents.In addition, on June 26, 2019, Scott Roehm, director of the Washington office, published an article at Just Security, “Deprivation and Despair: The Crisis of Medical Care at Guantánamo,” describing the above report.
