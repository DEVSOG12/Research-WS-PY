People are global. Justice should be too.Our MissionProtect migrant rights by ensuring justice across borders.Farmworker lawyer and human rights advocate Cathleen Caron founded Justice in Motion* in 2005 to address a growing crisis in our globalizing economy: abused migrant workers were shut out of the justice system because they returned to their families in their home countries. She recognized that this was a global phenomenon, but saw a solution. Human rights lawyers and NGOs could work together, across borders, to secure access to justice for those migrant workers. To make justice across borders a reality, Justice in Motion formed a Defender Network of human rights lawyers and nonprofit organizations throughout Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Defenders partner with U.S. lawyers on concrete legal cases for migrants, as well as advocacy and community education projects across the region. Now, we work to defend the rights of thousands of migrants from across the region each year -- from parents separated from their children at the U.S. border, migrant workers exploited by U.S. employers, to children seeking safety from harm. *Formerly Global Workers Justice Alliance Subscribe to Our NewsletterI accept terms & conditionsSubmitThanks for submitting!Justice in Motion protects migrant rights by ensuring justice across borders.HomeCase StoriesJoin UsPublicationsPressinfo@justiceinmotion.org | (646) 351-1160PO BOX 160128, BROOKLYN, NY, 11216, UNITED STATES
