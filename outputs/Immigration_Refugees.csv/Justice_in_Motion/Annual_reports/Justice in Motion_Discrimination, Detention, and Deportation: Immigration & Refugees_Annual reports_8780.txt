2020 Results
Through a global pandemic, devastating hurricane 
season, and relentless political assaults on migrants 
seeking safety in the United States, Justice in Motion 
helped thousands of migrants access portable justice. 
The dominant work in the past year continued to be 
the response to the Family Separation Crisis. We are 
proud to share the following highlights. 
Family Reunification Efforts
By October of 2019,  the government was forced to reveal the names 
of 1,500  more children who had been separated prior to the well -known 
“Zero Tolerance” family separation policy . Our partners contacted hundreds 
of parents , but were unable to reach hundreds more via traditional means . 
Through painstaking on -the-ground searches over the past fiscal year , 
Justice in Motion Defenders have located nearly 200 parents who would 
have otherwise been unreachable **. 
**These numbers reflect specific searches completed by the Justice in Motion Defender Network during 
our fiscal year spanning October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020. 
In January 2020, nine parents 
returned to the U.S. to be 
reunited with their children 
while they seek asylum here. 
The onset of the global pandemic 
in the Americas forced us to 
pause all on-the-ground work 
between March and August 
2020. When it became clear 
that the pandemic would not end 
soon, many Defenders chose to 
don protective gear and resume 
the search.COVID-19 
With support from the Justice in Motion 
Defender Network, 30 administrative 
complaints and two federal lawsuits 
have been filed by lawyers in the U.S. 
to help deported parents pursue justice 
for the harms they suffered after being 
separated from and then deported 
without their children. For an inside look at what 
it takes for Justice in Motion 
to find families, watch 
“The Unreachables,” a short 
documentary produced by 
VICE News on Showtime.

“It is our job to find a 
communication channel from 
parents to their children and for 
them to have the opportunity to 
reunite one day. These parents 
and children are going to live 
with that trauma all of their lives.”
