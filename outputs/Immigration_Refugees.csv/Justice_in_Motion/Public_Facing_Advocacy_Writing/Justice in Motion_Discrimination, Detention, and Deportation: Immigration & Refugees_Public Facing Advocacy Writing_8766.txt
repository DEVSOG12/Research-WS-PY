Previously, nine separated parents reunited with their children in the United States through a court-ordered return in January 2020, while others returned in 2019 with the support of Justice in Motion and Al Otro Lado.​Justice in Motion Founder and Executive Director, Cathleen Caron, said:​“Today is a momentous day in our fight to reunite separated families and help them access justice and healing. For three years, Justice in Motion and our partners have been on the frontlines of efforts to find separated families and make these reunifications possible.​“To date, members of the Justice in Motion Defender Network in Central America and Mexico have located hundreds of separated parents through our Herculean cross-border search efforts. We continue to work tirelessly to locate remaining parents and ensure all families affected by this horrific policy get the same opportunity to heal together in safety.​“We also recognize that reunification is just one step in the larger journey toward justice and restitution. As such, we call on Congress to take immediate action to guarantee families have access to the legal status and resources they need to begin healing from the trauma of separation. Justice in Motion is proud to endorse the Families Belong Together Act, which would provide affected families with a pathway to citizenship so that they can be together without fear of future separation.”###Justice in Motion protects migrant rights by ensuring justice across borders.
