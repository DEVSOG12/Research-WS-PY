Legal ActionWe are proud to have helped thousands of migrants 
in 2016 through our Legal Action, Policy Advocacy, and Education programs. Here are some highlights we would like to share with you.
Advancing justice across borders through legal actions continues to be 
our primary focus. In 2016, we are pleased to report that Justice in Motion:
Assisted in 111 legal actions in US, Mexico, or Central America legal venues:
 96 in the US 15 in Mexico or Central America, expanding litigation support in countries of    origin to combat recruitment fraud and abuse
Helped more than 1,500 migrants, either directly or indirectly
Assisted 48 lawyers in advancing transnational litigation in 27 US states 
Engaged 20 Defender Network members to assist in concrete cases in Mexico, 
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, as we continue to grow their involvement and substantive knowledge

priority this year was to shed light on the obscure and abusive temporary foreign 
worker visa system by:
Conducting a congressional staff briefing with partner organizations, Polaris and the Economic Policy Institute, to 
illuminate the problems temporary visa workers face during their stay in the US and in their countries of origin during the recruitment process
Demonstrating how greater transparency in the recruitment supply chain can help prevent human traffickingEmphasizing the importance of the Visa Transparency Anti-Trafficking Act of 2016 as a necessary tool to create a 
standardized reporting system across nonimmigrant visa categories that authorize work and requiring that this information be made public
Increasing usage of Visas, Inc. and our online Visa Pages — now indispensable resources for policymakers and 
advocates 
South of the border, Justice in Motion has made inroads to affect policy by:
Partnering with governments in Guatemala and two state governments in Mexico to reduce recruitment visa fraud 
and increase prosecutions when migrants fall victim to these schemes
Publishing Recruitment Rules: Countries of Employment to serve as a training tool for governments and 
advocates to enhance their understanding of foreign recruiters’ rules of engagement in their territory
Providing training for various governments and allies so that they can more effectively protect the migrants in their 
region 
Publishing Recruitment Rules: Countries of Origin, a comparative study that shows what protections exist in 
Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua for migrants who are being recruited to work abroad
Hosting events to facilitate the implementation of standardized norms across the region that would prevent foreign 
employers from recruiting from countries with lesser protections or enforcement Busine ss is global.
People ar e global.
Justice should be global too.
info@justiceinmotion.org      www.justiceinmotion.org 789 Washington Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238      (646) 351-1160Education  
Education and awareness are instrumental in preventing exploitation.
To ensure that the Defender Network, US advocates, government partners, and allies are equipped to handle 
cross-border legal actions and prevent recruitment abuse and fraud, we conducted online and in-person trainings on the following topics:•   New H-2B visa regulations•   Recruitment rules in the US, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua•   Canadian temporary worker programs•   Labor trafficking victim identification
To enhance the expertise of US attorneys who take on these challenging transnational cases, we trained more 
than 100 lawyers and advocates on:•   The challenges of transnational litigation•   Best practices for transferring money to clients in Mexico•   J-1 visa data•   Recruitment laws and regulations in the region 
We also extended trainings to an international audience for the first time, sharing what we have learned in our 
region about recruitment to help find global solutions for these issues.
To empower migrants to avoid abuse through education, Defender Network members achieved positive results 
training more than 600 migrants on: •   How to avoid recruitment abuse and fraud•   Knowing basic labor rights before going to work in the US•   What to do if they have suffered violations to their rights
This was the final year of a three-year US State Department funded project, "Enhancing Victim Identification & 
Increasing Victims’ Access to Services." This project filled a large programmatic gap in Mexico — the need to expand and improve the identification of victims and increase their access to available resources and services. Many victims have gone unidentified, which only emboldens human traffickers to intensify their dirty work. As part of this project, Defender Network members in the Mexican states of Chiapas, Puebla, and Tabasco:•   Conducted trainings for local government agencies on human trafficking and best practices for victim identification•   Built a localized referral network of service providers for survivors
