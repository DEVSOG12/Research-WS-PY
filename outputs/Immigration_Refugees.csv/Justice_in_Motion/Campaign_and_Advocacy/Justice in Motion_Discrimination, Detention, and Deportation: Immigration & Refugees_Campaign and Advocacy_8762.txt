We connect and advise legal advocates across the US, Mexico, and Central America to ensure that migrants’ rights do not stop at the border. 
158 cases in US courts to support migrants who were fleeing violence and abuse, or who suffered rights violations while working in the US; and
15 cases in Mexico and Central America to combat fraud and abuse during the recruitment process for foreign work visas to the US or Canada. 
Through these legal actions, we helped
2177 migrants to defend their rights or remain in safety in the US;
55 lawyers in 19 US states to ensure access to justice for their migrant clients; and
30 Defender Network members to engage in concrete legal support work, from finding evidence for asylum cases, to facilitating remote testimony for migrant victims of wage theft. 
Amidst the challenges of 2017, Justice in Motion has redoubled our efforts to fight for migrants’ rights across borders. Through our Legal Action and Policy Advocacy programs, in collaboration with our Defender Network, we have secured access to justice for thousands of migrants.

THE DEFENDER NETWORK  
We train and coordinate a network of over 40 human rights defenders across Mexico, Gua-
temala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, so that they can serve as a resource for migrants in their communities. 
Building Local Capacity 
In 2017, Justice in Motion provided 6 trainings to 51 participants from the Defender Network to equip them to better inform migrants in their communities, as well as to collaborate with Justice in Motion on transnational legal cases. 
Community Education 
When people know their rights before they migrate, they are less vulnerable to exploitation. Justice in Motion developed a new Know Your Rights toolkit, a set of materials and resourc-es for Defenders to use while conducting rights trainings in their communities. 
One Defender in Michoacán, Mexico piloted the toolkit to conduct 8 trainings, empowering 
330 participants from more than 12 communities to avoid fraud and abuse during recruit-ment for foreign work visas. 
A New Structure and Strategy
After nearly a decade of growing the Defender Network, Justice in Motion has decided to amplify our impact in policy advocacy and migrant education by decentralizing our net-work—making it more flexible, more responsive, and more coordinated.  
To better understand Defenders’ needs, priorities, and vision, we conducted interviews with 
Defender organizations across Mexico and Central America. This work will culminate in the 2017 Defender Summit: we will bring over 40 Defender organizations to El Salvador, where we will lay the groundwork for the new network structure. Together, we will articulate a shared vision for the next decade of defending migrant rights.

Justice in Motion collaborates with human rights allies across North and Central America to 
solve the systemic problems that threaten migrants’ rights. 
Building a Field of Knowledge 
Exploitation and human trafficking happen in the shadows; we need to better understand the sprawling US visa system in order to expose and address these abuses. Justice in Motion and allies convened researchers from the United States and Canada at Cornell University for the first-ever interdisciplinary conference on temporary work visas, where they shared insights and developed a research agenda. 
Denouncing Abuses 
Justice in Motion released the report “Who, How, and How Much? Recruitment of Guatemalan Migrant Workers to Quebec.” The Canadian Temporary Foreign Work Program is often pre-sented as a model program. However, researchers found that migrants took on debt to pay massive illegal fees to recruiters, making them unlikely to denounce abuses they suffered once in Canada. With a cross-border team of researchers and human rights defenders, Justice in Motion published the report in both Canada and Guatemala, where we advocated with both governments for stronger protections against recruitment fraud and abuse. 
Forging Government Partnerships
Justice in Motion renewed our commitment with the state migration agency of Michoacán, Mexico. We trained more than 70 government officials on US labor rights and the US immigra-tion system, ensuring that they can better advise and protect their citizens when their rights are in jeopardy. 
Figures are based upon preliminary end-of-year forecasts for fiscal year 2017.Business is global.
