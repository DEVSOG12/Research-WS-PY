2018 Results
Justice in Motion has spent more than a decade building our Defender 
Network and developing our model of portable justice – the right and ability of all migrants to access justice across borders. 
That careful work enabled us to respond to the 2018 family 
separation crisis, even as we continued to grow our Defender Network, policy advocacy, and legal programs. We are proud to share the following highlights. 
FAMILY SEPARATION 
CRISIS RESPONSE
Under its short-lived but disastrous family separation 
policy, the U.S. government deported more than 400 
parents without their children –  with no plan to reunite 
them. Justice in Motion mobilized our on-the-ground 
Defender Network to help the parents who were  
deported without their children and abandoned  
 in Central America. 
Access to Justice  
for Separated Families 
Some separated families were 
fleeing persecution but were denied 
a fair asylum process. Others need  
justice for the harms they suffered at the hands of U.S. officials. Justice in Motion connected 33 deported families with U.S. lawyers –  enabling 
them to access justice across borders.  March 2018
Justice in Motion launched 
cross-border Civil Rights 
Pilot Project to find 
deported migrants who suffered civil rights abuses and secure access to justice 
in U.S. courts. April
U.S. government 
began “Zero Tolerance” immigration policy, 
under which more than 2,000 migrant children were forcibly separated 
from their families at 
the U.S. border. May
Justice in Motion began 
"fact-finding" mission in 
Central America for the 
ACLU's Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit 
on behalf of separated families, interviewing 
parents deported without 
their children. June
The court in Ms. L v. 
ICE ordered that the 
government reunify 
separated families; we learned that more than 400 parents were deported 
without their children.July
Justice in Motion 
mobilized our on-the-ground Defender 
Network in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico to find the 
deported parents. August
Justice in Motion 
appointed to Steering 
Committee for Ms. L. 
v. ICE litigation. We began to interview parents, document their 
reunification wishes, and 
convey them to the court. September
Justice in Motion 
accompanied reunifications in 
Central America – making sure 
parents had the information, 
documents, and resources they needed to reunite with 
their returning children. Justice in Motion 
reached over  95 separated 
families and 
accompanied 
28 family 
reunifications. 
Justice in Motion mobilized  
14 Defender organizations  
in 4 countries.

The Visa Transparency  
Anti-Trafficking Act
Every year, thousands of workers 
travel to the United States under temporary foreign worker visas. But the system is opaque and unwieldy. Some unscrupulous employers take advantage of this system to exploit vulnerable workers and even commit human trafficking. The Visa Transparency Anti-Trafficking Act would pull together data that the government already collects about the many different visa categories. Making this data available will enable anti-trafficking advocates and law enforcement to identify and prevent human trafficking.We connected  
29 Defenders with 99 lawyers  
and NGOs in 20 U.S. states  
to secure portable justice.Staff
