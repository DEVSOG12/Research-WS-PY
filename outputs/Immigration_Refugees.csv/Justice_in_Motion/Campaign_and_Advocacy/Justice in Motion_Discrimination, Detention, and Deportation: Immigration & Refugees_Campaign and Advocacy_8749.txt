2019 Results
In 2019, we continued to grow our Defender Network, Legal Action, and Policy 
Advocacy programs to protect migrant rights across borders — whether reuniting 
separated families, helping asylum seekers to stay in safety, or promoting smarter 
migration policies to ensure that all workers are treated fairly. We are proud to 
share the following highlights. 
FAMILY SEPARATION CRISIS RESPONSE
Interviewed and screened 
40 deported families for 
potential civil rights cases , to 
pursue justice and healing for 
the harms they sufferedDeveloped and referred 15 cases 
to U.S. civil rights lawyers, who 
will work with our Defenders to 
support families throughout the 
cross-border legal process 
Reuniting in Safety
Defender Network members accompanied 
39 deported parents who were denied a fair 
asylum process as they sought to safely reunite 
with their children in the U.S. Supported the filing of 3 
administrative complaints 
and 1 class action lawsuit 
to secure justice and healing 
for separated families

Art: Amanda FloresOne year after the U.S. government forcibly separated migrant families at the U.S.–Mexico border, Justice in Motion is 
still working to secure reunification and justice for every parent deported without their child. Our response to the family 
separation crisis is grounded in more than 15 years of cross-border work to protect migrant rights through our unique 
Defender Network of human rights advocates in Central America and Mexico.ONE YEAR LATER“

POLICY ADVOCACYWe connect and advise legal advocates across the U.S., Mexico, 
and Central America to ensure that migrant rights do not stop 
at the border.
▶ Humanitarian Immigration: We supported 
269 cases for migrants fleeing persecution and abuse, 
helping them to pursue immigration relief in the 
United States. 
▶ Employment:  We supported 26 employment 
cases to enable migrant workers to defend their legal 
rights against human trafficking, wage theft, and other 
labor abuse. 
▶ Civil Rights: We supported 21 civil rights cases 
to ensure access to justice for deported migrants 
whose civil rights were violated during arrest, detention, 
and removal.
We collaborate with human rights allies across North and Central 
America to solve the systemic problems that threaten migrant rights. Our legal program served 1,744 migrants 
through 322 legal cases*

borders on migrant rights cases.
Shining a Light on Summer 
Work: A First Look at the 
Employers Using the J-1 
Summer Work Travel Visa 
In partnership with the International Labor 
Recruitment Working Group, Justice in 
Motion co-authored a report exposing 
serious flaws in the J-1 Summer Work Travel 
program and proposing reforms to keep 
workers safe. You can read the report at 
justiceinmotion.org/publications. The summer work travel program, the way that it’s set 
up, lends itself to human trafficking. Debt is a strong 
motivator for you to stay in suboptimal conditions... 
in work conditions you didn’t agree to.
