As a result, migrant families were forcibly separated at the U.S. - Mexico border. The government tore children away from their parents, sending them to separate facilities. Many children could not contact their parents for weeks or months. Traumatized parents were imprisoned and rushed through the court system. Many were denied a fair chance to explain if they were fleeing persecution and needed protection in the U.S. – a right protected under U.S. asylum law.  Others signed “voluntary departure” papers believing that was the only way they would see their children. Thousands of families were ripped apart, and hundreds of parents were deported without their children. While we knew that families had been separated during pilot programs starting as early as July 2017, the government wasn’t forced to reveal  the full scope of its family separation policies until late 2019.Click our interactive timelines to learn about our work reuniting families:2017-2018April 2018May-JulyJuly-Aug.July 2017Aug.-Dec. 20182019-2020Feb. -AprilAprilJune - Oct. Sept.Jan.MarchJan. 2019Aug. 2020- PresentHow is Justice in Motion helping separated families?  The United States government deported hundreds of separated parents with no plan or intention to reunite them with their children.
