In recent years, we have educated policymakers about key problems in foreign temporary worker visa programs on both sides of the border; encouraged Labor and Foreign ministry officials in countries of origin to consider improved enforcement of recruitment protections for migrants; and raised awareness about the importance of portable justice among policymakers and civil society throughout the North-Central America corridor.​​Our WorkPolicy AdvocacyTemporary Foreign Worker Visa GovernanceJustice in Motion published Visas, Inc.: Corporate Control and Policy Incoherence in the Temporary Labor System.  to provide a panoramic examination of U.S. temporary work visas. The findings revealed a fragmented system that lacks transparency and government oversight, resulting in abuse of both foreign and U.S workers. U.S. immigration policy has moved away from its roots in permanent labor migration and embraced, for better or worse, a constantly metastasizing temporary worker visa program. Rather than developing a coherent, unitary system, the U.S. has responded piecemeal to employer demands and created a patchwork of visas subject to distinct rules.With the launch of Visa Pages: U.S. Temporary Foreign Worker Visas, we endeavored to continue to add information and perspective to the major non-immigrant work visas highlighted in Visas, Inc. Improving Recruitment RegulationsJustice in Motion published Recruitment Rules: Countries of Employment to detail the legal framework for international labor recruitment in four common temporary work programs:​1.
