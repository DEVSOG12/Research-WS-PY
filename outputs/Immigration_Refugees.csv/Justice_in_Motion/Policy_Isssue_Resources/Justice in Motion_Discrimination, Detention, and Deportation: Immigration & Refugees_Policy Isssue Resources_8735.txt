The findings revealed a fragmented system that lacks transparency and government oversight, resulting in abuse of both foreign and U.S workers. Indeed, U.S. immigration policy has moved away from its roots in permanent labor migration and embraced an array of utterly chaotic, constantly metastasizing temporary worker visa programs. Rather than developing a coherent, unitary system, the U.S. has responded piecemeal to employer demands and created a patchwork of visas subject to distinct rules.​To curtail abuse and misuse, Justice in Motion believes that future reform must happen holistically, with the recognition that these individual visas constitute a de facto temporary foreign labor system. By maintaining Visa Pages as an online resource, Justice in Motion seeks to advance an informed conversation around the future of temporary foreign worker programs in the U.S.H-2AAgricultural Work213,394 visas issued in 2020*204,801 visas issued in 201994% of H-2A visas originate in MexicoThe H-2A nonimmigrant visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when they cannot find enough U.S. workers.Read MoreDownload PDFH-2BNon- Agricultural Work69,684 visas issued73% of H-2B visas originate in MexicoThe H-2B nonimmigrant visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary or seasonal non-agricultural jobs when they cannot find enough U.S. workers.Read MoreDownload PDF61,865 visas issued in 2020*97,623 visas issued in 2019H-1BSpecialty Occupation172,748 visas issued69% of H-1B visas originate in IndiaThe H-1B nonimmigrant visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers for specialty and professional occupations under conditions approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.Read MoreDownload PDF124,983 visas issued in 2020*188,123 visas issued in 2019J-1Exchange Visitors332,540 visas issued11% of J-1 visas originate in ChinaThe J-1 nonimmigrant visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers under the auspices of an educational and cultural exchange visitor program without testing the U.S. labor market.Read MoreDownload PDF108,510 visas issued in 2020*353,279 visas issued in 2019L-1Intracompany Transfers78,537 visas issued30% of L-1 visas originate in IndiaThe L-1 nonimmigrant visa program allows multinational employers to bring to the U.S. as intracompany transfers their current or former foreign employees who are managers or executives or who have specialized knowledge.Read MoreDownload PDF35,942 visas issued in 2020*76,988 visas issued in 2019A-3/G-5Domestic Workers1,824 visas issued23% of A-3/G-5 visas originate in PhilippinesThe A-3 and G-5 nonimmigrant visas allow foreign diplomats and employees of international organizations to employ foreign workers for in-home domestic work.Read MoreDownload PDF415/149 visas issued in 2020*857/404 visas issued in 2019F-1Students644,233 visas issued43% of F-1 visas originate in ChinaThe F-1 nonimmigrant visa allows foreign individuals to study in the United States; work is allowed on-campus part-time, and off-campus in only certain situations requiring government approval.Read MoreDownload PDF111,387 visas issued in 2020*364,204 visas issued in 2019B-1Business Visitors43,421 visas issued21% of B-1 visas originate in PhilippinesThe B-1 business visitor visa is available for a wide variety of business travelers, including domestic workers who are employed by U.S. citizens or nonimmigrants, trainees (B-1 in lieu of H-3), and high-skilled workers employed by foreign companies (B-1 in lieu of H-1B).Read MoreDownload PDF17,919 visas issued in 2020*37,841 visas issued in 2019Data Source: U.S. Department of State*2020 visa numbers reflect lower overall visa numbers because of Executive Action restricting certain visas specifically and reduced participation generally due to the coronavirus pandemicACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe Justice in Motion team would like to recognize the following individuals who have contributed to the Visa Pages project since 2013.
