That means voting with a commitment to the success of our students. From elections at the highest level to the most local races, education is always on the ballot. Make your voice heard and vote in support for students, teachers, and high-quality public schools.GET INVOLVEDProgramsWhere we workStand with usProgramsThe Center for High School Success provides training, coaching, data analysis, peer learning opportunities, tools, and resources to help high schools substantially increase the number of 9th-graders on-track to graduate. Using the Ninth Grade Success Approach, we partner with high schools committed to becoming communities where all students excel academically, and race and socio-economic status do not predict success.The home is a child’s first classroom. Through Home Visit Partnerships, teachers meet students’ families and learn about their lives outside of school. By confronting our own biases, and intentional two-way communication that focuses on listening and learning from families, teachers earn families’ trust which creates more support for the student. Home visits are all about building community and bridging the gap between schools and home so that students get the help and attention they need to succeed.Classrooms have become stages for extreme politicians to advance their agenda at the expense of students’ access to the high-quality education they deserve. Learn From History is a coalition of organizations representing millions of parents, educators, students, and community members who support teaching accurate U.S. history in American public schools. Together we push back against misinformation and censorship, and strive for a thorough, fact-based history education for all students.Kinder schools are safer schools. Kindness is a powerful, common-sense solution to some of schools’ and society’s biggest challenges. Teach Kindness provides free, research-based tools and resources to schools that want to make kindness a practical, commonplace skill. By teaching children to practice kindness on a regular basis and to manage their emotions, actions, and words, they become better equipped to navigate our complex world and these challenging times.Where we workStand ArizonaFounded in 2009, Stand Arizona empowers parents to support their children’s education journey and advocates for proven policies and the funding necessary to ensure all students have access to a high-quality education.Founded in 2009, Stand Arizona empowers parents to support their children’s education journey and advocates for proven policies and the funding necessary to ensure all students have access to a high-quality education.Stand ColoradoStand Colorado supports parents and community members in their fight for excellent public schools and works closely with local leaders to shape education policy and ensure the changes we fight for reach classrooms and directly support students.Stand Colorado supports parents and community members in their fight for excellent public schools and works closely with local leaders to shape education policy and ensure the changes we fight for reach classrooms and directly support students.Stand IllinoisStand Illinois makes an impact by advocating for policies and funding that level the playing field so that all students have a fair chance to succeed in the classroom and in life.Stand Illinois makes an impact by advocating for policies and funding that level the playing field so that all students have a fair chance to succeed in the classroom and in life.Stand IndianaSince 2011, Stand Indiana has worked to improve education outcomes for all children by utilizing a strong three-pillared approach: Parents, Politics, and Policy.
