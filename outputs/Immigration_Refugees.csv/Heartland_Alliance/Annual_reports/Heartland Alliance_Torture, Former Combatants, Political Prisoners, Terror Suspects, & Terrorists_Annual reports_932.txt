In the last year, three Heartland Health
Outreach programs merged into one thatserves refugee families who experienced
trauma in their home countries. The mergerstrengthens the treatment of whole families,allowing parents and children to be treatedtogether. In addition, it facilitated an expansionof services, allowing the program to offeradditional therapies, such as art and dance.
Hans Buwalda, a program manager, explains
the therapeutic value of expressive therapies:
“For example, an Ethiopian women’s group is working with doll making. That can betherapeutic because the doll making triggersmemories — both traumatic and positive.“The activity and memories encourage thewomen to talk about dolls they had as children,
or a skirt their mother had, or how they wouldnever use a certain color because it reminds themof their attacker who was wearing that color.
“It can also be therapeutic because they had the art forms before they came to the U.S.The art helps them reconnect to part of whatthey used to be, to connect to the person they are now.
“Dance therapy is therapeutic for children 
who have experienced trauma because in
most cultures, children are punished for actingaggressive or angry.
But through dance and
movement — through action, a familiar
expression for children — they can be a lion or a monster and feel aggression or angerwithout feeling ashamed or being punished.”IFamilyCare and KidCare Expansion

homelessness prevention
On average, it takes $3,400 to shelter a family of three
for two months. Most episodes of homelessness last 8 months — for an average cost of $13,600 per family.
In contrast, it takes on average $850 to prevent a family frombecoming homeless in the first place.
Heartland Alliance is collaborating with a number of
organizations and government agencies throughoutChicago to fight homelessness.
Heartland Alliance manages
$1.5 million in prevention funds, which are accessed by 40
agencies citywide.
Investing in homelessness prevention makes sense. Each year,
millions of dollars are spent by area nonprofits and local, stateand federal programs to serve the homeless population inChicago. That amount does not include the cost to local public
services like the police and fire departments or emergencyrooms serving those with limited access to health care.Heartland Human Care 
Services receives more than 50 calls a day from peoplehoping to receive homelessnessprevention funds.
Last year, 1,800 households
received, on average, $850
dollars each to keep them from homelessness.inhuman services2003 ANNUAL REPORT 7
For refugee students 
who speak little English,
remembering that you
should remove cookies fromthe sheet with a spatula is aschallenging as rememberingwhich tool is a “spatula.”
A higher paying job is crucial to exiting poverty. For people with little to no schooling, a higher paying
job is not just a resume and an interview away. It takes skills building and training. In the last year,Heartland Alliance launched two innovative programs designed to get people into jobs that payenough to lift them out of poverty.
cooking up success
Many refugee women from Africa come to the U.S. with little to no experience working outside the home. Heartland Alliance’s refugee culinary training allows them to turn one of the skills theyalready possess — cooking — into an opportunity to raise their standard of living. In addition totraining in the kitchen, the refugees increase their English skills in the classroom. “Translating theskills that they already possess into a paycheck has been very empowering for the women,” says Kari Szydel Mueller, a supervisor working with the refugees.
skills for independence
Microsoft-certification training gives people with little to no experience with computers a shot atgetting a job in an office, with opportunity for advancement. Learning to click and point, format alist or make a headline bold can be the building blocks to a better life.
Mastering these skills enables a job seeker to earn significantly more money, according to
certification trainer Nichole Oh. “One woman lost her job, took the training, became certified, andlanded another job doing basically the same work but for $4.50 more per hour.”
8H EARTLAND ALLIANCEFor the past four years, the Illinois Poverty
Summit, coordinated by HeartlandAlliance, has produced the annual Report
on Illinois Poverty.
Through the report, Heartland Alliance
generates media attention that helps bringpoverty issues to the forefront of publicdiscussion. The report also puts research intothe hands of other anti-poverty advocates —including legislators and community leaders —who then have the information they need to
work toward eliminating poverty in Illinois.in human services
helping handsThis year, a downstate anti-poverty advocate truly brought thereport’s key findings to life:
“At the time the report arrived, we were planning an event
in the Diocese to educate people, particularly children, about
poverty. I liked all the information in the report but didn’twant to just overwhelm people with numbers.
I went back to my science fair days and came up with the idea of making a triptych using the most striking, mostpertinent and most visually enticing findings from the report. Then I blew up a few key findings and turned them 
into sandwich boards. The kids who wore them really enjoyed themselves.”
Rob Otrembiak, Executive Director of Catholic Charities of Southern Illinois
Every year around the holidays, Heartland Alliance solicits and receives donations
of thousands of toiletries to create “hygiene kits” for people who are homeless and low income. For the last three years, Heartland Alliance has been able to makean average of 1,000 of these kits, which often include such winter essentials assocks and gloves.
Last year, thanks to the generous support of businesses and community groups,
Heartland Alliance programs distributed more than 
1,200 kits to people who are
homeless, vulnerable women and children, and people living with HIV and AIDS.

paths to safety
Human trafficking is almost where domestic violence 
was 10 years ago,” says Miriam Torrado, director of a new
program that works with victims of human trafficking.
“It’s hidden — people who have been trafficked don’t know what to do or where to go. Traffickers use control, silence and
intimidation, plus there is often the language barrier — whichkeeps people isolated and alienated by the individual who
trafficked them.
“It mirrors the domestic violence scenario. If you don’t know thelanguage, where would you run? Who would you turn to? 
“The trafficked people are told, ‘There’s no one going to help you
here. They’ll deport you. We know where your family is.’”
To combat trafficking’s hidden nature, staff educate organizations
and individuals who may come in contact with a trafficked
individual — police, hospitals and religious organizations.“Human trafficking is
almost where domestic
violence was 10 years ago. It’s hidden — 
people don’t know what to do or where to go.”“H2003 ANNUAL REPORT 15No country is immune from trafficking. A recent U.S. Government estimate
indicates that approximately 800,000–900,000 people annually are traffickedacross international borders worldwide and between 18,000 and 20,000 ofthose victims are trafficked into the United States.

“Winning my first asylum case was the most gratifying
victory of my legal career. Basically, we were saving this
man’s life. That’s more than what is usually at stake inmy pr actice.”
Jannis Goodnow, of Lord Bissell & Brook, was the lead pro bono a ttorney
for a Midwest Immigrant & Human Rights Center asylum case. She has
been practicing law for 16 years.new protections 
Undocumented immigrant survivors of domestic
violence are in a particularly vulnerable positionbecause their abusers often use their lack of legal 
immigration status as a means to keep them and theirchildren in the abusive relationship.
A new project of Heartland’s Midwest Immigrant &
Human Rights Center provides legal remedies toimmigrant survivors of domestic violence and helps connect them to social workers.
Since its inception in the fall of last year, the new project
has served more than 300 individuals and their children.Last year, staff and pro bono
attorneys provided legal counsel 
to more than 600 people seeking
asylum or other forms of
protection from persecution intheir home countries.
Heartland Alliance’s overall success
rate of 86% for winning asylumcases is especially noteworthy, asthe national approval rate is less than 30%.

securing lives and liberties
Changes in immigration enforcement and laws in the wake of September 11 continue to have a significant impact onthe people Heartland Alliance serves:
•The flow of refugees into the U.S. has slowed dramatically post-9/11. Of the 70,000 refugees authorized to enter
the U.S. last year, only 28,000 were allowed entry, despite passing multiple background checks.
Conditions in the refugee camps where refugees are waiting are often deplorable and dangerous. Typically located
close to the country from which the refugees fled, enemies frequently come into the camps and continue to kill,abduct or rape their victims. Heartland Alliance staff have been active advocates at the national level for continuedrefugee admissions.
•A tany given time in Chicago, some 600 immigrants are in detention, most for administrative violations that
have no connection to terrorism. They are usually kept with the general criminal population. Immigration
lawyers, including those at Heartland Alliance, have little success getting information on who is detained, whereand for how long they will be held. Detainees, meanwhile, have limited access to their lawyers.
Heartland’s Midwest Immigrant & Human Rights Center conducts outreach and “Know Your Rights” trainings in
numerous languages, including Arabic, and is collaborating with other human rights organizations to gain better
access to detainees and information about them.
•The situation for immigrants, in general, became considerably more difficult post-9/11. Many of the human rights
issues relevant to immigration from Mexico and Central America with which Heartland Alliance’s internationalprogram was working were taken off the table. In response, the program intensified its training of immigrantcommunity groups throughout the Americas to be their own best advocates at the national and international level.healing and hope
In the last year, Heartland’s Marjorie Kovler Center for the Treatment ofSurvivors of Torture provided training in Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Indiana,Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.Internationally, the Kovler Center trained service providers in El Salvador,Great Britain, Guatemala, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico and Sri Lanka.
Unfortunately, this increase in training reflects an ongoing need for torture
treatment centers worldwide. In 2002, more than 280 people obtainedmental health, medical and social services from the Kovler Center, anincrease of 30% in a year.

The time I invest in Heartland
Alliance nets a return I couldnever put a monetary figure to. That is the return of whatI teach my children, and thesocial aspect of working withwomen in my community.
When I learn about situationsthat I have no idea what itis like to be in, it is a verygrounding experience. Myparents taught me abouthelping people with great needby example. I hope that I cando the same for my children,my friends and neighbors.

I have headed a rather
successful company for twodecades. From where I started,my chances of attaining this
position are less than one in ahalf million. I then ask myself,how did this happen and why?The only plausible answer is,“to help make my village
better” — and I use “village”in a very euphemistic sense.I have been given gifts, and Ibelieve I must turn around and share those gifts withhumankind.

Everyone has time. We make
choices about how we spend our
time. Students invest their timein coming to class. Teachersinvest time in preparing forclass. I see the commitment toteach and to continue learningas an investment in yourself. Iwant to contribute something
to society — I don’t always wantto take — so I give my time.
