Contributors explore the hidden ramifications of convictions for inmates and for those who have already served their time — including a host of “invisible punishments,” from disenfranchisement and disqualification from public housing, welfare benefits, and job training, to greatly increased exposure to fatal diseases. Other essays examine the financially encumbered families who must travel hundreds of miles as a result of the rural prison movement, and the communities deprived of young men who would otherwise be starting families and careers. Edited by Marc Mauer and Meda Chesney-Lind, Invisible Punishment defines the boundaries of a whole new field of inquiry concerning criminal justice in America and should open the door to a profound reconsideration of our approach to crime and punishment.The book is published by The New Press and is available from its catalog and national booksellers.Marc Mauer is the assistant director of The Sentencing Project, a national organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes criminal justice reform. He is the author of Race to Incarcerate (The New Press).Meda Chesney-Lind is a former vice president of the American Society of Criminology, a professor of women’s studies at the University of Hawaii, and the author of the award-winning Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice.IncarcerationGender JusticeCollateral ConsequencesRelated PostspublicationsOctober 25, 2022Locked Out 2022: Estimates of People Denied Voting RightsChristopher Uggen, Ryan Larson, Sarah Shannon, and Robert StewartAn estimated 4.6 million Americans are barred from voting due to a felony conviction.Download PDFRead OnlinenewsOctober 03, 2022October is Youth Justice Action Month!October is Youth Justice Action Month! Our network of allied advocates and supporters use this month to celebrate the actions we’ve taken in the movement to end youth incarceration and provide all youth with the support they need to thrive.Youth JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up5.2MAmericans are barred from voting due to felony disenfranchisement lawsMore FactsTake ActionActions related toIncarcerationSupport the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and the First Step Implementation ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
