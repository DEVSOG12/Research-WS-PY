At the state level, many policymakers are now advocating changes in sentencing policy and practice that reflect new thinking and options for lower-level drug offenders in particular. These proposals emphasize shorter prison terms and/or diversion to treatment programs for cases in which substance abuse is an underlying contributor to crime, and for which it is believed that these approaches will provide greater public safety benefits.In contrast to these developments, a variety of policy changes beginning in the 1970s and increasing in recent decades have set in motion a movement to extend considerably the length of time that other offenders spend in prison. These changes include such policies as mandatory sentencing, “truth in sentencing,” and cutbacks in parole release. While many of these initiatives apply primarily to persons convicted of a violent offense, in some cases they mandate long-term incarceration even for persons convicted of property or drug offenses.Foremost among the changes affecting the prison population in recent years are laws affecting “lifers,” those persons receiving a sentence that may result in an offender never being released from prison. Policy considerations for persons sentenced to life are very different than for offenders who appear far less threatening, such as low-level drug offenders. For violent offenders who have taken lives or who pose a serious threat to public safety, incapacitation as a means of assuring public safety is a legitimate and compelling concern at sentencing. In addition, under current laws and sentencing philosophies, lifetime incarceration is deemed an appropriate punishment for the harm done by serious violent offenders.However, the issue of life sentences is far more complex and cannot be regarded as merely strict sentencing for a deserving population of serious violent offenders. A closer examination of the number of people serving life sentences, their offense characteristics, and the judicial process by which their sentences were imposed, challenges many of the assumptions about the composition of the lifer population. Among those serving life are persons who themselves have not committed violent acts and others whose life circumstances suggest they are more vulnerable than violent.In this report we assess the dramatic increase in the imposition of life sentences in the context of incapacitation and public safety, fiscal costs, and the sentencing goal of punishment, including the implications for both victims and offenders.To read the report, download the PDF below.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationRelated PostspublicationsMay 27, 2021Letter in Support of the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and First Step Implementation ActAmy FettigIn a letter of support submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, The Sentencing Project's Executive Director Amy Fettig expressed the importance of advancing the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act (S.312) and the First Step Implementation Act (S.1014).Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesDrug PolicypublicationsFebruary 17, 2021No End In Sight: America's Enduring Reliance on Life ImprisonmentAshley NellisIn the United States, more than 200,000 people are serving life sentences – one out of every seven in prison.Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up775%Increase in number of women incarcerated in the U.S. since 1980More FactsTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
