State Sentencing Reforms 2004-2006March 01, 2007Ryan KingBetween 2004 and 2006, at least 22 states enacted legislative reforms to their sentencing policies, or adopted policy changes affecting probation and parole revocation procedures.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyBetween 2004 and 2006, at least 22 states enacted legislative reforms to their sentencing policies, or adopted policy changes affecting probation and parole revocation procedures.These reforms have been driven by a number of factors, including budget crises at the state level, the development and expansion of a range of programs offering alternatives to incarceration, and the falling crime rate. These state initiatives to limit prison population growth build upon a trend first evident several years ago.At the same time, both established and newly enacted sentencing policies continue to exert upward pressure on prison populations in many states. These include the mandatory sentencing laws for drug and other offenses in most states, harsher sentencing provisions such as “three strikes and you’re out,” and cutbacks in parole release. During the 2006 legislative session, a number of states adopted harsher sentencing provisions for sex offenders as well, often increasing prison time for offenses already subject to harsh terms.Thus, despite the many sentencing reforms adopted in recent years, the state prison population has continued to grow, increasing by 7% from 2000 to 2005. State policymakers concerned with escalating prison populations will need to address sentencing and parole policies with a multifaceted approach, incorporating an expanded use of alternatives to incarceration for low-level offenders, increased access to high-quality treatment, better funding for the agencies necessary to deliver vital social services, and a commitment to using incarceration only if other interventions cannot meet the goals of public safety or justice.While much of the legislation highlighted in this report targets limiting the time served by individuals who have been convicted of low-level offenses, no long-term and sustainable reduction in the prison population will be possible without addressing the sentencing policies that contribute to long-term incarceration as well. Such sentences are too often disproportionate to the crime for which defendants have been convicted, they mandate imprisonment for a period far beyond which any tangible public benefit can be gleaned, and come at a significant fiscal and social cost. Thus, while the developments showcased in this report are encouraging, lawmakers hoping to build upon these successes will need to apply the lessons learned from these initiatives to a broad-scale examination of the use of incarceration.To read this report, download the PDF below.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRelated PostspublicationsOctober 25, 2022Locked Out 2022: Estimates of People Denied Voting RightsChristopher Uggen, Ryan Larson, Sarah Shannon, and Robert StewartAn estimated 4.6 million Americans are barred from voting due to a felony conviction.Download PDFRead OnlinenewsOctober 03, 2022October is Youth Justice Action Month!October is Youth Justice Action Month! Our network of allied advocates and supporters use this month to celebrate the actions we’ve taken in the movement to end youth incarceration and provide all youth with the support they need to thrive.Youth JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up1 in 3Black men born in 2001 can expect to go to prison in their lifetimeMore FactsTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
