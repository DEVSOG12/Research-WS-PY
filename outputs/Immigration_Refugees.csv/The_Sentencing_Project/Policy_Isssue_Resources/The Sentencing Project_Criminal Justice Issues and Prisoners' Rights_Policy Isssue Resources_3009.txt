TrumpThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NWWashington, DC 20500March 26, 2018Re: National coalition rejects death penalty and increased penalties for drug offensesDear President Trump:The United States must effectively confront the devastation resulting from substance use disorders. The skyrocketing increase in overdose deaths – totaling 64,000 in 2016 alone – is a national tragedy that requires substantial resources from the federal government as well as state and local public health officials to address. Given these circumstances, the 62 undersigned faith, civil rights, treatment and legal organizations are deeply troubled by the punitive elements of your administration’s proposal regarding the nation’s drug problems – including increasing already harsh sentences for drug offenses and employing the death penalty. We unequivocally condemn accelerating the use of the death penalty and urge your administration to support proven public health strategies to end the opioid crisis, reduce problematic drug use and save lives.As criminologists and many policymakers have documented, ratcheting up already tough sentences for people with drug convictions will produce little public safety benefit while carrying heavy fiscal, social, and human costs. Many people entering the criminal justice system are in the lower- and middle-levels of a drug operation. Incarcerating these individuals often results in their being replaced by other sellers willing to fill their roles, and does nothing to address the substance use disorders that users, and many sellers themselves, struggle with. Increasing already severe prison terms has a limited deterrent effect because most people do not expect to be apprehended for a crime, are not familiar with relevant legal penalties, or criminally offend with their judgment compromised by substance use or mental health problems.1)Lynch, J., Heimer, K., Peterson, R.D., Miller, J., DeJong, C., Armstrong, G., Zhang, S.X.

Letter to the Attorney General on DOJ Charging and Sentencing Policy.Current federal mandatory minimum sentences, which apply to many drug offenses, are considered among the harshest in the country. Nearly half of the Bureau of Prisons population is comprised of people convicted of drug offenses. African Americans and Latinos comprise 76% of this population2)Carson, E. (2018). Prisoners in 2016.

(pp. 15–16). As of 2012 people serving a federal prison term for a drug offense were serving an average of 11.3 years.4)In 2016, the average prison sentence imposed on those entering federal prisons for a drug offense—in contrast to the average sentence being served by those already there—was 5.6 years.

Almost half (49%) of the 3,861 individuals serving a federal life-without-parole sentence in 2016 are incarcerated for a drug offense.5)Nellis, A. (2017).

The Sentencing Project.Concerns about these harsh federal sentences have led to broad bipartisan consensus in support of criminal justice reform. Indeed, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley advanced his bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act through committee on a 16-5 vote in February. The bill would give federal judges discretion in sentencing people below a mandatory minimum sentence for low-level drug cases and curb outsized sentences.According to a 2017 report from the National Research Council, “Lack of economic opportunity, poor working conditions, and eroded social capital in depressed communities, accompanied by hopelessness and despair,” have been the underlying structural determinants of substance use disorders.6)Bonnie, R., Ford, M., & Phillips, J. (Eds.). (2017). Pain Management and the Opioid Epidemic: Balancing Societal and Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use. Washington, DC: The National Academies, Pg. 41. Moreover, limited access to drug treatment and medically assisted treatments in particular has undermined the opioid response. One study found that just 21.5% of people with opioid use disorder received any treatment between 2009 and 2013—including non-professional treatment such as self-help groups.7)Saloner, B. & Karthikeyan, S. (2015). Changes in Substance Abuse Treatment Use Among Individuals With Opioid Use Disorders in the United States, 2004-2013. The JAMA Network, 314(14), Pgs. 1515-1517. Surveys reveal that one-third of people with substance use disorder did not seek out professional treatment because they lacked health care coverage or could not afford the cost.8)Hughes, A., William, M.

Rockville, MD: National Survey on Drug Use and Health Data Review, Table 5.61B.To address these needs we endorse investments in communities to expand educational and vocational opportunities, and to ensure access to community-based drug treatment programs, medical care and mental health services. We reject the punitive and overly simplistic approach of the War on Drugs that has contributed to the United States’ world record levels of incarceration, and has fractured families and communities in the process. We ask for your support in advancing a more humane and evidenced-based approach to ending the opioid crisis.If you have questions, please contact Kara Gotsch, Director of Strategic Initiatives at The Sentencing Project at (202) 628-0871 or kgotsch@sentencingproject.org or Jesselyn McCurdy, Deputy Director of the American Civil Liberties Union Washington Legislative Office at (202)675-2307 or jmccurdy@aclu.org.Sincerely,African American Ministers In ActionAkeela, Inc.American Civil Liberties UnionAmerican Friends Service CommitteeBrennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawBuried Alive ProjectCANDO FoundationChurch of Scientology National Affairs OfficeCongregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, US ProvincesThe Constitution Project at POGOCriminal Justice Policy FoundationCURE (Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants)Daytop New JerseyDefending Rights & DissentDrug Policy AllianceThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in AmericaExodus Foundation.orgFaith Action NetworkFamilies Against Mandatory MinimumsFedCUREFranciscan Action NetworkFriends Committee on National LegislationHarm Reduction CoalitionHuman Rights WatchIslamic Society of North AmericaJewish Council for Public AffairsJustice Programs Office at American UniversityJustice StrategiesLatin America Working GroupLaw Enforcement Action PartnershipLegal Action CenterLife for PotNational Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good ShepherdNAACPNational Association of Criminal Defense LawyersNational Association of Social WorkersNational Center for Lesbian RightsNational Center for Transgender EqualityNational Council of ChurchesNational Immigration Project of the National Lawyers GuildNational LGBTQ Task ForceNETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social JusticeNORMLOffice of Social Justice, Christian Reformed Church in North AmericaOhio Justice & Policy CenterPresbyterian Church (U.S.A.)QueeriSafer FoundationThe Sentencing ProjectSinsinawa Dominican Peace and Justice OfficeStoptheDrugWar.orgStudents for Sensible Drug PolicyTransgender Law CenterTreatment Communities of AmericaUnion for Reform JudaismUnitarian Universalist AssociationUnited Church of Christ, Justice and Witness MinistriesThe United Methodist Church – General Board of Church and SocietyWOLA (Washington Office on Latin America)Witness to Mass IncarcerationWomen Who Never Give UpWorker Justice Center of New YorkCc: Secretary Alex Azar, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Speaker Paul Ryan, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, U.S. House and Senate Judiciary CommitteesFootnotes[+] Footnotes↑1 Lynch, J., Heimer, K., Peterson, R.D., Miller, J., DeJong, C., Armstrong, G., Zhang, S.X.
