Conclusion 23 4  The Sentencing Project
After a year-and-a-half of pandemic-fueled disruptions, 
the reopening of schools this fall on a (more-or-less) 
regular schedule marks a moment to celebrate, a chance 
for the nation’s children to get back to normal – or 
hopefully much better than normal – in their pursuit of 
learning, growth and achievement. 
But it is also a moment of truth – a pivotal turning point 
for the U.S. education system. This moment is filled 
with opportunity – a time when educators, advocates, 
and community leaders might apply the many lessons 
learned in recent times about how to finally close the 
school-to-prison pipeline. 
Thanks to a $122 billion infusion of federal funds, 
schools and communities can invest vast resources in 
effective new approaches that offer us the power to 
keep children in school and help them progress along 
the path to educational success. 
However, given the epidemic of disconnection, learning 
loss, and tragedy American children suffered during the 
pandemic, the moment will also be fraught with pitfalls. 
Absent an intentional effort to reject counterproductive 
zero tolerance discipline strategies and over-policing 
of public schools, and absent concerted efforts to adopt 
evidence-based and developmentally-appropriate 
strategies that engage young people in learning, foster 
a positive school environment and respond constructively 
to misbehavior, this could be a year of educational 
tragedy for millions of our nation’s most vulnerable 
students. 
If we don’t seize the opportunity, if we instead allow our 
schools to reopen on autopilot, we are likely to see a 
year of educational backsliding that needlessly pushes 
students by the busload out of school and into the 
justice system. Unless schools and communities rise 
to the challenge, untold numbers of young people might 
be thrust quickly into the justice system through 
unwarranted school arrests stemming from [mis]-
behavior that should be not only predictable, but 
anticipated. Also, given the far higher likelihood of arrest 
that arises whenever a young person leaves school 
without a diploma, many more young people could be 
relegated to the justice system more gradually if schools sustain their overreliance on suspensions and expulsions 
and don’t make adequate efforts to re-engage and 
support them.
Worse yet, these failures would exacerbate the gaping 
racial and ethnic disparities that have long plagued our 
nation’s education and justice systems. And they would 
deepen the difficulties faced by children with special 
educational needs, those in poverty, those involved in 
the child welfare or mental health systems, and those 
residing in disinvested and under-resourced communities 
– the very children who have suffered most during the 
pandemic. 
None of these bad outcomes is inevitable, however. 
Solutions are available to re-engage students in the 
new school year and to close the school to prison 
pipeline over time.
 
In this report, The Sentencing Project details a wide 
variety of promising and proven strategies through 
which schools and community partners can:
• Reduce unnecessary arrests at school,
• Replace the counterproductive overuse of 
exclusionary discipline (e.g., suspensions and 
expulsions),
• Improve social and educational climate within 
schools, and
• Provide vulnerable students with the services 
and supports they need to maintain good 
attendance, avoid disciplinary problems, thrive 
academically, and remain on track toward 
graduation and higher education.
 INTRODUCTION
By embracing these solutions, by making creative and 
strategic use of relief funds, we can establish a new 
normal in our education system that fosters success, 
promotes equity, conforms to best practice, and 
recognizes the realities of adolescent behavior and 
brain development, as well as the impacts of trauma.Back-to-School Action Guide 5
CHALLENGES FACING AMERICA’S SCHOOL 
CHILDREN
The covid pandemic sharply limited the amount and 
quality of instruction provided to public school students 
nationwide, leading to both lower achievement test 
scores compared with prior years and a big spike in 
absenteeism as many students disengaged from the 
school process.
Learning Loss
A July analysis by McKinsey & Company found that by 
the end of the 2020-21 school year, America’s school 
children were, on average, five months behind in math 
and four months behind in reading compared to what 
would be expected in a typical school year.1 Other 
studies showed that substantially more students were 
far behind in the spring of 2021 than in prior years, 
particularly in math.2 And the pandemic prompted a 
surge in the share of school children failing one or more 
academic classes.3
Disengagement 
Meanwhile, the shift to remote instruction led to 
wholesale disengagement from school among a 
significant swath of the nation’s student population. In 
a national survey of teachers in the Spring of 2020, 52% 
reported that half or fewer of their students were 
completing the distance learning activities assigned to 
them; only 15% of teachers said that all or nearly all 
students were participating.4Worsening Disparities 
These consequences were felt far more severely by 
Black and Latinx students than white children, and by 
those from low-income families.5 Studies show that 
children of color were far less likely than white children 
to receive in-person instruction,6 and – if relegated to 
remote instruction – far less likely to have devices and 
internet access necessary to participate.7 In the spring 
of 2021, one-fourth of principals in schools where 50% 
or more of the students are low-income, or Black or 
Latinx, reported that half or less of their students had 
home access to the internet.8 Children attending schools 
serving mostly Black or Latinx students saw both a far 
larger than average drop in the share of students testing 
at grade level in reading and especially math, and a far 
larger rise in the share of students two or more grades 
behind.9 Also, due to disruptions in the in-person 
supports and instruction many need, the pandemic 
disproportionately harmed students with special needs   
10 and those who require English language learning 
support services.11  
Spike in Behavioral Health Problems
In addition to these academic challenges, the pandemic 
caused a serious spike in mental health problems among 
adolescents nationwide. Compared to pre-pandemic 
times, young people have become more likely to 
contemplate or attempt suicide12 and more likely to 
visit the emergency room due to mental health 
problems.13 Nearly half of parents in a nationwide survey ENORMOUS EDUCATION AND YOUTH 
DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
America’s reopened schools are likely to face unprecedented challenges in the 
new school year as students – many of whom have suffered educationally, 
psychologically, and socially during the pandemic – return to schools that are 
themselves confronting serious, longstanding challenges.  6  The Sentencing Projectin early 202114 said their adolescent children had 
developed a new or worsening mental health condition 
since the start of the pandemic. Likewise, a large 
majority of students in a national survey in early 2021 
reported that they are “experiencing more problems 
now than they did in January 2020, before the pandemic 
began, ” and these problems were especially prevalent 
among youth of color.15 
For virtually all children, and especially for adolescents, 
the pandemic interrupted important developmental 
milestones,16 as young people were cut off from their 
peer groups and missed significant life events – 
everything from getting a first job to earning a driver’s 
license to going on their first dates. With school buildings 
closed, many youths were forced to care for younger 
siblings while trying to handle their own remote school 
assignments. 
Many children endured traumatic experiences during 
the pandemic. Some were thrown into economic crisis, 
or faced food insecurity, due to covid-related layoffs. 
Many youth grieved for loved ones who died or became seriously ill from the virus. Research shows that such 
trauma can have serious long-term consequences for 
young people’s educational progress and their future 
well-being generally.17  
Given all of these realities, many experts anticipate 
unprecedented behavioral difficulties in the re-opening 
of schools, as well as pervasive attendance problems, 
as students unaccustomed to attending school and 
meeting behavioral expectations are forced to follow 
not only the regular rules of school but also a host of 
new requirements related to pandemic health safety. 
For instance, the National Association of School 
Psychologists wrote last year that; “Under normal 
circumstances, we would expect approximately 20% of 
children to experience some social–emotional and 
behavioral concern throughout their school trajectory—
we now expect these rates to double or triple after 
COVID. ”18

year, ” Phyllis W. Jordan, the editorial director at Future

be kids who have behavioral outbursts, and you’re just 
going to have kids who are out of practice at being in 
school who are just not behaving properly, ” said Jordan, 
who previously worked as an education reporter for the 
Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. “And the 
worst thing a school can do is flush them all out with 
suspensions or harsh discipline. There is going to have 
to be some attention and training on issues like 
restorative practices and ways of coping with these 
issues that kids are going to have. ”
CHALLENGES FACING SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND 
THEIR STAFFS
In addition to all of these difficulties facing children, 
the adults working in public school systems can (and 
often do) also contribute to poor outcomes, both 
individually and through the problematic policies and 
practices schools sometimes employ. Indeed, all 
indications suggest that most US schools are not 
prepared to respond effectively to the current challenge.
A Workforce Under Duress 
In an April 2021 poll of teachers nationwide, 92% 
reported that they found their jobs more stressful in 
2021 than prior to the pandemic.20 In other polls during 
the pandemic, alarming numbers of teachers reported low morale, stress, burnout/fatigue, and anxiety at 
work.21 In February 2021, nearly one-fourth of teachers 
in a nationwide survey said they were likely to leave 
their jobs by the end of the 2020–2021 school year, far 
more than in prior years.22 Meanwhile, enrollment in 
college teacher preparation programs has fallen steadily 
in recent times,23 foretelling a likely teacher shortage 
in the years to come.24  
A Host of Prevalent Problematic Practices 
Educators throughout the US will be returning to schools 
that, prior to the pandemic, commonly employed many 
practices that fueled the School-to-Prison-Pipeline, 
perpetuated severe disparities, and left many students 
behind.
Too many police  
Back in 1975, just one percent of schools nationwide 
had a school resource officer25 (SRO) stationed on-site 
to provide security; by 2017-18 that figure had risen to 
61%.26 Yet, there is compelling evidence that the 
presence of SROs tends to increase the number of youth 
arrested at school, often for low-level offenses, and that 
having SROs on campus exacerbates racial and ethnic 
disparities.27 The presence of SROs does not protect 
against school shootings, scholars find, and there is 
little or no evidence that SROs improve other indicators 
of school safety.28 “You’re going to have some discipline problems this year.
And the worst thing a school can do is flush them all out with suspensions or 
harsh discipline. There is going to have to be some attention and training on 
issues like restorative practices and ways of coping with these issues that 
kids are going to have."
Phyllis W. Jordan  
Editorial director at Future Ed  8  The Sentencing ProjectNot enough counselors  
By contrast, research has shown that “school staff who 
provide health and mental health services to our children 
not only improve their health outcomes for those 
students, but also improve school safety. ”29 Yet, nearly 
two million students nationwide attend schools with 
police officers but no guidance counselors, 6 million 
attend schools with police but no psychologists, and 
10 million attend schools with police but no social 
workers.30 Nationwide, the ratio of counselors to 
students in US schools (1:444) is nearly twice that 
recommended by experts (1:250). Not a single state 
meets the recommended ratio of students to social 
workers, and only four states meet the recommended 
staffing ratio for school psychologists.31Drastic Overuse of Arrests 
Despite a federal law requiring school districts to report 
the number of students arrested or referred to law 
enforcement, the majority of large districts nationwide 
do not. Therefore, while the latest federal data show 
that more than 230,000 students were referred to law 
enforcement in 2015-16,32 the actual number is likely 
far higher.33 More reliable data from state and local 
school systems find that the majority of arrests are for 
low-level misdemeanor offenses like disorderly conduct 
or simple assault (schoolyard fighting), and racial 
disparities for these kinds of offenses are vast.34  
Research makes clear that getting arrested sharply 
decreases the likelihood of completing high school and 
increases the likelihood of future arrests and justice 
system involvement.35  Figure2. Ratio of Guidance Counselors to Students in U.S. Public Schools

courtesty of Amir Whitaker of ACLU of Southern California.Back-to-School Action Guide 9Over-reliance on Exclusionary Discipline 
US schools have also seen a troubling increase in 
suspensions and expulsions since the 1970s, fueled 
by the nation’s embrace of “Zero Tolerance” discipline 
policies requiring severe consequences for a wide range 
of misbehaviors at school. Overwhelming research has 
found that zero tolerance policies cause much more 
harm than good:36 getting suspended or expelled sharply 
increases children’s odds of dropping out of school37  
or entering the justice system,38 and attending a school 
with high rates of suspension and expulsion is 
associated with lower graduation rates and worse 
academic achievement.39 In the past few years, as 
awareness of this research has grown, the use of 
exclusionary discipline has begun to fall.40 This progress 
has been highly uneven, however, and the use of 
exclusionary discipline remains extraordinarily 
widespread nationwide. American school children lost 
11.2 million days of instruction to out-of-school 
suspensions in the 2017-18 school year, more than 
60,000 full school years.41
Glaring Racial and Ethnic Disparities 
In terms of both arrests and exclusionary discipline, 
data consistently find glaring disparities. For instance, 
Black high school students nationwide lost five times 
as many school days in 2015-16 as their white peers.42 
While national data are not collected reliably, available 
data and research consistently find that Black and 
Latinx youth are far more likely than white children to 
be arrested at school, particularly for less serious 
offenses. In Florida, for instance, Black girls made up 
22% of the total female student population, but 74% of 
the female students arrested for disorderly conduct.43 
Inadequate Support for Children with Disabilities
Studies consistently find that children with disabilities 
are arrested and suspended at far higher rates than 
other students, despite federal laws prohibiting schools 
from punishing children for behaviors caused by their 
disabilities.44 The covid-19 pandemic has caused 
particular hardship to students with disabilities.45 Many 
school districts were unable to provide youth with 
disabilities the services they required to participate successfully in distance learning,46  and frequent delays 
were reported for students needing new or updated 
individualized education plans.47 
Unnecessary Barriers to Re-entry for Returning and 
Relocating Students
The education system often does a poor job of enabling 
youth to return to school after placement into detention 
or correctional facilities, or into residential treatment 
centers. Also, homeless youth and those in the foster 
care system, who tend to be relocated frequently and 
forced to switch schools, often face serious difficulties 
in transferring credits from one school to the next.49  
SUMMARY: AN IMPENDING CRISIS
Given the disruption, lost learning opportunities and 
psychological stress suffered by students in the first 
18 months of the pandemic and schools’ continuing 
reliance on problematic practices in dealing with student 
behavior, the U.S. education system faces grave risks 
in the 2021-22 school year. Unless schools tap the 
resources of community partners and aggressively 
embrace promising new approaches, many young 
people will likely be criminalized or excluded from school 
due to predictable behavior problems, and many will be 
pushed out of school or left to drift away due to 
inadequate outreach, encouragement and support. 10  The Sentencing ProjectWhile the dangers facing the US education system are 
daunting, the current moment is even more noteworthy 
for the immense opportunities available to schools and 
communities nationwide. If they heed the lessons of 
best-practice research and invest available federal 
resources wisely, schools and communities can foster 
the success of returning students and engineer an 
overdue shift away from ineffective and inequitable 
practices that have long plagued our education and 
justice systems.
ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENTS
Today’s educational landscape features many 
encouraging developments and many assets that can 
be used to create a new ethos of effective and inclusive 
education; engage and support all students; and offer 
constructive and age-appropriate responses to 
predictable adolescent misbehavior.
A Massive Infusion of Federal Funds 
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan approved by 
Congress and signed by President Biden in March 2021 
included a provision allocating $122 billion for the 
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief 
Fund. These dollars, which are targeted to support state 
and local education agencies in their efforts to “reopen 
K-12 schools safely” and to “equitably expand opportunity 
for students who need it most, ”50 come on top of the 
$68 billion in K-12 education funding included in earlier 
stimulus packages enacted in 2020.51 
These $122 billion, to be spent over three years (more 
than $40 billion per year), represent the largest infusion 
of federal funding for elementary and secondary 
education in U.S. history. By contrast, the biggest 
ongoing federal funding program for elementary and 
secondary education, known as Title I, allocates $16 
billion to local education agencies each year.52 
The new law instructs states and local school districts 
to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable students, 
the very young people at greatest risk for entering the justice system, and it offers public school officials 
extraordinary flexibility to address the educational 
harms of the pandemic in almost any way they see fit. 
The law includes a provision to ensure that relief funds 
are not used to cover costs that would ordinarily be 
paid with existing funds, and it requires local education 
agencies to spend at least 20% of the funding to address 
learning loss among students impacted by the pandemic 
using strategies with at least some evidence of 
effectiveness or research-based rationale.53 
But beyond these modest requirements, school districts 
can spend the federal money on a vast variety of 
activities to address needs arising from the pandemic. 
In other words, over the next three years education 
officials across the nation will have at their disposal a 
previously unimaginable influx of financial resources 
which they can allocate toward virtually any approach 
they can reasonably describe as promising, either to 
help vulnerable students return successfully to school 
or to support other changes that promote the long-term 
well-being of student populations who have not been 
served successfully in the past.
The challenge facing school leaders and their community 
partners will be to employ those dollars wisely – to 
make the most of the time-limited opportunity by funding 
efforts that employ the most promising approaches, to 
implement them effectively, and to do so in a way that 
cements lasting changes and leads to long-term 
progress for the neediest students.
Momentum for Change on School Discipline and 
Policing 
While attention to the school-to-prison pipeline has 
been growing nationwide for more than a decade, the 
conversation has taken on a new urgency since May 
2020 when the murder of George Floyd sparked a 
nationwide movement to protest police brutality and 
promote reform in policing practices
In June 2021, Education Week identified 33 school

large school systems in all regions of the country such 
as Oakland; Des Moines; Alexandria, Virginia; Denver; 
Milwaukee; and Seattle. Since that list went to press, 
several more school districts have voted to remove 
police from their school buildings including San Jose, 
California55 and Arlington, Virginia.56 
In addition, many other school districts have curtailed 
or modified their school policing programs recently to 
reduce the number of SROs or limit their roles in 
response to community concerns. Los Angeles County57 
cut 133 SRO positions, removed all officers from being 
stationed on campuses, banned the use of pepper spray 
on students and reallocated $25 million to an initiative 
to improve the educational experiences of Black 
students. Continuing a reform movement that has cut 
school arrests from more than 6,000 arrests in 201058 
to 1,000 in 2018-19,59 Chicago’s school board voted in 
August 2020 to cut funding for SROs from $33 million 
to $12 million.60 Seventeen Chicago high schools voted 
to remove their SROs in 2020, and another 22 voted to 
remove one or more SROs in 2021 after the school board 
began allowing local school councils to reallocate 
$50,000 in flexible funding for each school resource 
officer removed to support alternative approaches to 
school safety.61 In 2020, Phoenix terminated its $1.2 
million SRO program and reallocated the funds to 
support alternative approaches to school safety selected 
by students, parents and school staff.62 
In addition, the use of exclusionary discipline has begun 
to decline nationwide, benefiting youth in all demographic 
groups, both at the elementary and secondary school 
levels, including youth with disabilities. Nationwide, the 
suspension rate fell 23% from 2011-12 to 2017-18, the 
last year for which data are available.63
Engaged and Capable Community Partners. 
The pandemic has strengthened partnerships between 
schools and community organizations to engage and 
assist vulnerable students and families facing pandemic-
related needs. All over the nation, community-based 
organizations have provided assistance to youth and their families thrown into crisis by the pandemic, and 
partnered with schools to promote school attendance. 
Detroit launched a door-to-door campaign where parent 
volunteers visited the homes of students who had not 
been showing up to class.64 In Brooklyn, NY, staff of a 
local community development organization provided 
all manner of assistance to students and their families 
at a local public school – distributing groceries, filing 
food stamp applications, providing rental assistance, 
organizing masked summer camp – in addition to 
operating its usual after school learning programs.65  
A growing body of research finds that strong connections 
to community organizations, especially when community 
partners are invited inside the school building and 
become part of the educational fabric, lead to better 
academic outcomes. Based on this research, a task 
force at the Brookings Institution called in 2021 for 
“transformation of U.S. schools into community schools” 
that bring “together educators, communities, and 
families to support every student every day. ”66 The panel 
called the community school approach “a proven 
solution that addresses educational inequities and 
leapfrogs our school system toward a new way of 
teaching and learning that honors local assets and 
helps students develop the competencies and skills 
they need to thrive in work, life, and citizenship. ”
In their efforts to put federal relief funds to optimum 
use, school systems and their community partners can 
draw upon a wealth of new knowledge regarding what 
works (and doesn’t work) to address or prevent problem 
behavior, and to improve outcomes for youth most at 
risk of school failure or entry into the justice system.Back-to-School Action Guide 13REFORMING SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AND 
CLOSING THE SCHOOL-TO PRISON PIPELINE
To close the school-to-prison pipeline and more 
effectively address misbehavior at school, a number of 
strategies are effective in minimizing arrests, reducing 
the use of exclusionary discipline, and improving the 
school climate in ways that enhance safety and foster 
student success.
Minimizing arrests
Schools and communities throughout the nation have 
experimented with a wide variety of strategies in recent 
times to minimize the use of arrests as a response to 
common and non-dangerous misbehavior at school. 
From these efforts, several key lessons are apparent:
End police presence inside schools 
Research suggests that eliminating or vastly reducing 
the number of School Resource Officers (SROs) and 
other law enforcement officers stationed within schools 
will boost student success without compromising 
safety. This strategy should be especially beneficial if 
resources previously spent for SROs are redirected to 
other more constructive uses. Fortunately, dozens of 
jurisdictions nationwide have voted over the past year 
to eliminate or scale back the number of school resource 
officers and other law enforcement personnel stationed 
in their schools. Because this trend is so new, there is 
no direct evidence yet to show the effect of removing 
officers in terms of school safety or student outcomes. 
However, the extensive research that is available on 
SROs makes clear that their presence does not protect 
against school shootings, and findings are mixed about 
their impact on other indicators of school safety.67 
There is substantial evidence, however, that the presence 
of SROs tends to increase the prevalence of arrests 
and the use of exclusionary discipline, exacerbating 
racial and ethnic disparities. Moreover, the presence of 
SROs is associated with reduced academic achievement 
and lower graduation rates.68 In a 2020 review of the 
research, University of Delaware Sociologist Aaron 
Kupchik found “strong evidence of unintended harmful consequences that come with policing programs [inside 
schools], including thrusting students into the criminal 
justice system and perpetuating racial inequality. ”69 
Create school-justice partnerships to minimize arrests
A number of jurisdictions nationwide have sharply 
reduced school arrests in recent years through 
community partnerships in which local stakeholders 
negotiated and signed agreements precluding arrests 
for specific offenses and devised a continuum of less-
punitive alternative responses to misbehavior. Clayton 
County, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb, has cut school 
arrests by 95% since 2003 (from 1,345 in 2003 to just 
69 in 2018) after local leaders in public education, law 
enforcement, the courts, and other community 
stakeholders negotiated and signed an agreement 
precluding arrests for an extensive list of low-level 
offenses and devised a continuum of less-punitive 
alternative responses to misbehavior instead.70 Judge 
Steven Teske and other leaders in Clayton County have 
conducted training on their model in dozens of 
communities, and replication efforts have been launched 
in numerous jurisdictions across the country. Also, the 
National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges 
has promoted the “Teske Model” nationwide through 
its School-Justice Partnership Project.71 
In Philadelphia, school arrests have plummeted 84% 
from 2013-14 to 2018-19 after former Deputy Police 
Chief Kevin Bethel brokered an agreement to preclude 
arrests for many routine misbehaviors and instead to 
refer youth to community youth development agencies 
funded by the city’s Department of Human Services.72 
In Broward County, Florida, community leaders agreed 
in 2013 to stop referring youth accused of 13 offenses 
to juvenile court.73 Instead, these youth spent several 
days at an alternative program focused on behavior 
and self-awareness. The arrest rate for students in 
county schools soon fell by more than 50%.74 In all of 
these sites, the keys to success have been to forge 
consensus on behaviors that will no longer be subject 
to arrest, and to identify more therapeutic alternative 
responses that will be used instead.AN ABUNDANCE OF PROMISING STRATEGIES 14  The Sentencing ProjectDevelop an emergency mental health response to 
students’ behavioral episodes 
Having emergency-response mental health professionals, 
not law enforcement officers, respond to students’ 
behavioral episodes offers another promising strategy 
for reducing school arrests. For instance, Connecticut’s 
School-Based Diversion Initiative connects students at 
risk of arrest for disruptive behaviors to mental health 
providers in their communities. The model, which also 
trains school staff on mental health and helps schools 
reduce reliance on suspensions and expulsions, has 
enabled participating schools to reduce juvenile court 
referrals by 34%. The model has been adopted in 48 
schools statewide, and has been exported to schools 
in several other states as well.75 In Summit County 
(Akron), Ohio, the “Responder” program assigns case 
managers from the County’s juvenile court to assess 
and work with youth exhibiting behavioral and 
attendance issues in school. Youth who successfully 
complete the Responder program are referred back to 
court less than half the rate as similar youth who do 
not complete the program.76 The National Center for 
Youth Opportunity and Justice (previously known as 
the National Center for Mental Health and Juvenile 
Justice) has promoted this model77 for many years, and 
has published numerous publications and tools78 to 
support its implementation.REDUCING THE USE OF EXCLUSIONARY 
DISCIPLINE
Increasingly, experts agree that zero tolerance policies 
and heavy reliance on exclusionary discipline 
(suspensions, expulsions) are both detrimental and 
discriminatory – with youth of color and those with 
special education needs targeted disproportionately. 
As a result, the use of suspensions in recent years has 
begun to decline nationwide. However, this progress 
has been highly uneven, and – as noted above – the 
use of exclusionary discipline remains extraordinarily 
widespread nationwide (more than 11 million schools 
days lost per year to suspensions79), with immense 
racial and ethnic disparities.80  
Effective strategies to lower the number of suspensions 
and expulsions include:
Rewriting the school discipline code 
Many jurisdictions in recent years have substantially 
reduced suspensions and expulsions by rewriting their 
school discipline codes. Changes to Chicago’s discipline 
code in 2012 and 2014, combined with efforts to employ 
restorative justice principles and promote social and 
emotional learning, helped cut out-of-school suspensions 
by 76% and expulsions by 59%.81 A major revision of Figure 3. Reducing Arrests at School Through School-Justice Partnerships

likewise helped spark dramatic reductions in exclusionary 
discipline: from a high of 26,000 suspensions in 2004 
to 6,600 in 2013.82  
Expanding therapeutic responses to misbehavior
Reducing exclusionary discipline also requires schools 
to provide developmentally-appropriate responses – or 
ideally a continuum of them – to address misbehavior. 
These can include simple warnings or required apology 
letters, behavior workshops, counseling, restorative 
justice conferences, or referral to wraparound programs 
offering a comprehensive array of support for children 
and their families.
In Clayton County, Georgia , students typically receive 
only a modest response to any first incident (write an 
apology letter, perhaps only a warning), while for a 
subsequent infraction students may be told to attend 
a workshop related to their behavior (anger management, 
substance abuse, etc.). For youth who are persistently 
disruptive, Clayton County has developed a system of 
care offering more intensive assessment to identify 
and address any underlying issues that children (and 
their families) may be grappling with.
In Cleveland, the local school system established 
student support teams – including a teacher, 
administrator and mental health professional – to work 
individually with young people who exhibit warning 
signs such as chronic truancy or behavioral referrals. 
Combined with other new efforts to improve the school 
climate and promote social and emotional learning, the 
support teams helped Cleveland cut behavioral incidents 
by half district-wide and reduced out of school 
suspensions by 60%.83 
In Broward County, Florida , when local leaders agreed 
in 2013 to stop referring students to court for 13 
behaviors that previously resulted in court referrals, 
they created a new program – PROMISE – where youth 
work with counselors, examine the reasons for their 
misbehavior and learn new skills. Less than 10% of 
students referred to PROMISE were committing a new 
offense as of 2016, and school arrests in the county 
fell 63%.84 Embracing Restorative Justice and other approaches 
to improve school climate 
Schoolwide implementation of Restorative Justice and 
Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), 
as well as teaching Social and Emotional Learning, can 
enhance safety and foster academic success.
• Restorative Justice 
In 2020, an evaluation study found that in 15 
Baltimore City public schools where Restorative 
Justice (RJ) was implemented on a school-wide 
basis in 2018, suspensions fell 44% in one year.85  
Large majorities of staff in schools adopting 
Restorative Justice reported that the project 
had improved school climate (72%), mutual 
respect among students (69%), and student 
respect for staff (64%). Studies of Restorative 
Justice in other jurisdictions have sometimes 
produced more mixed results, and have 
highlighted the need for rigorous and careful 
implementation.86 Yet, a recent review of 
Restorative Justice in schools concluded that 
while research remains limited, the preliminary 
evidence suggests that “RJ has positive effects 
on exclusionary discipline rates, discipline 
disparities, and school climate. ”87 
• Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports
PBIS is a multi-tiered school-wide intervention 
model designed to foster a positive school 
climate, support learning, and limit the need for 
and use of exclusionary discipline. PBIS has 
been adopted by more than 25,000 schools 
nationwide,88 including more than 3,000 high 
schools,89 and several evaluation studies have 
found that, when implemented rigorously, PBIS 
significantly lowers suspension rates and yields 
a host of other positive outcomes.90 
• Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) 
A wealth of research indicates that young 
people’s long-term success relies heavily on the 
development of key attitudes, work habits and  16  The Sentencing Projectsocial skills, such as determination to succeed, 
interest in and connection to school, and ability 
to cooperate and work with peers.91 Social and 
Emotional Learning programs aim to help school 
children develop these skills and attitudes, 
sometimes through off-the-shelf curricula and 
other times through more organic learning 
opportunities emerging through their school 
lessons – or through opportunities to serve or 
contribute to their class, school, or community. 
Many studies have found that students exposed 
to effective SEL instruction improve on key social 
and emotional skills and attitudes, and achieve 
better grades and more long-term success than 
youth who do not receive this instruction.92 
Hiring additional counselors and mental health 
professionals
Research suggests that schools can improve safety 
and student well-being by expanding their staff of 
guidance counselors and mental health professionals 
– or by bringing in community providers. Shortages of 
counselors, social workers and psychologists persist 
in schools nationwide despite evidence that, as a 2019 
report from the American Civil Liberties Union found, 
“mental health providers improve school climate and 
other positive outcomes for students. ”93 Moreover, this 
study found that “school staff who provide health and 
mental health services to our children not only improve 
the health outcomes for those students, but also 
improve school safety, ” and “schools that employ more 
[mental health staff] see improved attendance rates, 
lower rates of suspension and other disciplinary 
incidents, lower rates of expulsion, improved academic 
achievement and career preparation, and improved 
graduation rates. ”94
IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING STUDENTS AT 
RISK FOR FAILURE OR DROPOUT
Many promising and proven strategies are also available 
to re-engage and support vulnerable students who face 
elevated risks of dropping out or failing in the coming 
school year. By adopting these approaches, schools 
and communities might not only avert an epidemic of 
students leaving school during 2021-22, but also take 
a huge step toward erasing longstanding disparities in the education and justice systems while ushering in a 
new era of opportunity for children too frequently left 
behind in pre-pandemic times.
Identifying students at high risk of school failure
Education scholars in recent years have made enormous 
progress in pinpointing the early warning signs that 
predict when children are at extreme risk for school 
failure. Specifically, they found that half of all children 
who eventually drop out of school show problems in 
attendance (less than 80% attendance), behavior 
(unsatisfactory behavior mark in at least on class), or 
course completion (failing English or math) by the eighth 
grade, and 80% exhibited one of these signs by the 9th 
grade.95 Sixth graders who exhibited any of these 
indicators had a more than 75% likelihood of dropping 
out of school.96 These research findings provide 
educators an invaluable tool: by collecting and analyzing 
data regarding these early warning indicators, public 
school systems can identify youth at high risk of failure 
who require extra support and assistance in order to 
succeed.
Tapping community resources 
Increasingly, education and youth development experts 
recognize that schools must address the needs of the 
whole child, and often their family, in order to ensure 
success.97 Especially for children in vulnerable 
populations – racial and ethnic minorities, low-income, 
or with special needs due to disabilities or involvement 
in the child welfare system – schools must partner with 
community organizations and outside service providers, 
and they must tap the energy and talents of community 
residents interested to support children’s success. 
Toward this end, several strategies show significant 
promise.
Embrace the community school model 
By forging partnerships with and providing funding for 
community organizations to operate programs and 
provide crucial supports and services for vulnerable 
students and their families, community schools provide: 
(1) integrated assistance (i.e., wraparound services) to 
help children and their families access needed social, 
medical/dental and human services; (2) expanded 
learning opportunities during non-school hours; (3) Back-to-School Action Guide 17
support family and community engagement in school 
activities; and (4) involve parents and community 
members in decision-making around issues of common 
concern. A recent review of research on community 
schools concluded that “well-implemented community 
schools lead to improvement in student and school 
outcomes and contribute to meeting the educational 
needs of low-achieving students in high-poverty 
schools. ”98 A 2020 evaluation of community school 
effort in New York City by the RAND Corporation found 
that community schools “had a positive impact for 
students across a range of outcomes” including 
attendance, credit accumulation, and disciplinary 
incidents.99 Based on this promise, a task force 
assembled by the Brookings Institution issued a white 
paper in early 2021 calling for “transformation of U.S. 
schools into community schools, ” with a particular focus 
on the 4% of school districts nationwide that educate 
40% of US children and face the greatest concentration 
of student needs.100 
Recruit volunteers from the community 
Several of the most promising strategies to engage 
vulnerable students, and to help them succeed, require 
active involvement from community volunteers to tutor 
or mentor vulnerable students, and to reach out to 
children and families and promote consistent attendance 
at school. Therefore, ideally as part of their efforts to 
embrace the community school model, schools should 
partner with neighborhood-based organizations to bring 
in volunteers, cultivate their connection to the school 
community, and provide them with necessary training, 
supervision, and support. In these efforts, schools may 
wish to link with local Americorps programs, which may 
supervise large numbers of paid volunteers participating 
in this longstanding federal service program.101 The 
American Rescue Plan included an additional $1 billion 
dollars to support expansion of Americorps during the 
pandemic recovery, and these volunteers might be good 
candidates to serve in school-based service projects.102
Promote law enforcement strategies that divert youth 
from justice involvement
Instead of arresting youth who skip school or engage 
in low-level misbehaviors and referring them to court, 
or issuing truancy tickets or citations, law enforcement officers in some jurisdictions instead steer youth to 
supportive services and reconnect them with school. 
In Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, police have 
partnered with the public schools, area youth centers, 
and mental health experts on an ambitious initiative 
aimed at minimizing arrests, keeping youth out of court 
and connecting youth with positive activities or needed 
counseling or social services. Officers assigned to the 
Cambridge police department’s Youth and Family 
Services Unit receive extensive training on adolescent 
development and conflict resolution, and must follow 
strict protocols when dealing with youth incidents.103 
In the first five years of the program, youth arrests fell 
more than 70%.104 In Portland, Oregon, as well as many 
other sites participating in the Annie E. Casey 
Foundation’s Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative, 
police officers are instructed not to bring youth to 
detention for truancy and a variety of other low-level 
offenses. Instead, police officers bring youth to a 
“Reception Center, ” overseen by a local nonprofit agency, 
where counselors review the situation, interview the 
young person and his or her family, and steer the young 
person to relevant resources in the community.105 
Investing in promising interventions to boost student 
success 
Working with these volunteers and community partners, 
schools can adopt a number of promising strategies 
to engage and support students at risk of failure or 
dropout. Promising approaches include:Several of the most promising 
strategies to help vulnerable students 
succeed require active involvement 
from community volunteers to tutor or 
mentor students, and to reach out to 
children and families and promote 
consistent attendance at school. 18  The Sentencing ProjectIntensive tutoring
In April 2021, a coalition of leading education reform 
organizations sent a letter to the U.S. Department of 
Education singling out “targeted, intensive tutoring” as 
a critically important strategy to accelerate learning 
among students who are behind in their studies.106 The 
letter was written one month after publication of a 
groundbreaking random assignment study finding that 
intensive tutoring doubled or tripled the rate of math 
learning among 9th and 10th students in some of 
Chicago’s most disadvantaged public high schools.107  
Combined with previous studies documenting significant 
benefits from well-crafted tutoring programs, the new 
study leaves little doubt that intensive tutoring offers 
a powerful weapon in the battle to help students recover 
from the widespread learning loss caused by the 
covid-19 pandemic – and for any students who fall 
behind.108 As the authors of the new study put it, the 
powerful benefits available through intensive tutoring 
signify that it is never “too late or too difficult to substantially change the academic outcomes of children 
who are struggling academically even once they have 
reached adolescence. ”109 In March 2021, the Education 
Trust published a helpful guide to intensive tutoring 
detailing the research, offering implementation insights, 
and posing strategic questions for local leaders 
interested in developing intensive tutoring programs.110 
Attendance promotion 
Increasingly, education scholars have determined that 
chronic absenteeism, defined as missing more than 
10% of school days for any reason (excused or 
unexcused), is a critical factor in children’s educational 
success. “Missing even some school can have negative 
impacts, especially for students who live in or near 
poverty. Missing a lot of school, at any time, throws 
students completely off track to educational success, ” 
concluded one report from Johns Hopkins University.111 
As a result, the report continued, “one of the most

high-poverty students attend school regularly. ” A 2020 
Attendance Playbook documented a number of effective 
strategies to improve attendance.112 These included 
schoolwide strategies such as gentle reminders 
(postcards, text messages, phone calls) to parents and 
occasional home visits from teachers; and offering free 
breakfasts. For students who are already missing school 
regularly, providing “success mentors” – community 
volunteers, older students, or school staff – to meet 
regularly with students at school has substantially 
increased attendance in a variety of jurisdictions.113 
Promoting vulnerable students’ social and emotional 
learning at school
Scholars at the Chicago Crime Lab have published two 
random assignment studies showing powerful benefits 
from a school-based intervention called “Becoming a 
Man. ”114 In the program, high school students from 
disadvantaged neighborhoods meet weekly in a group 
to learn cognitive behavioral skills, participate in 
experiential group exercises, and talk about their 
concerns. The studies found that BAM improved 
participants’ school outcomes, raised graduation rates 
by 19%, and cut the likelihood of violent crime arrests 
by half. Since 2015, the BAM program has expanded 
to serve 8,000 students per year in Chicago, and 
replication efforts are underway in Boston, Los Angeles 
and Seattle. Other programs aiming to boost the social 
and emotional skills of vulnerable students have also “One of the most effective strategies for closing the achievement gap will 
be a concerted effort to enable and ensure that high-poverty students 
attend school regularly.”

shown strong results.115 Given these promising 
outcomes, schools seeking to help vulnerable youth 
remain in school and avoid the justice system should 
consider replicating BAM or similar models.
Building quality after school and summer programs
Finally, there is substantial evidence that vulnerable 
students can benefit from participation in positive youth 
development opportunities operated by community 
partners during non-school hours, and from well-crafted 
summer school programs that adhere to best practice. 
Although some research on the impact of afterschool 
programs has yielded disappointing outcomes,116 a 
preponderance of studies find that carefully-conceived 
and well-run programs that are intensive and combine 
academics with fun activities tend to improve young 
people’s attendance, social skills, and academic 
achievement. Likewise, the research on summer learning 
programs also yields mixed findings. Some summer 
programs do not yield measurable or lasting benefits ; 
however, many other studies find that summer learning 
programs can and do boost students’ success when 
they last at least five weeks with three hours per day 
of academic instruction, limit class size to 15 students 
of fewer, maintain strong attendance rates, mix engaging 
enrichment activities in addition to academics, and 
employ both certified teachers (for academic instruction) 
and engaging and knowledgeable activity leaders, 
preferably from the community.119  20  The Sentencing Project• Analyze available data to identify children at high 
risk for failure or dropping out using early warning 
indicators related to attendance, behavior and 
academic progress.
2. Mobilize the community to locate and engage these 
students and promote their success
• Forge partnerships with community organizations 
with the capacity to help schools connect with and 
engage young people and provide needed support 
and assistance to these youth and their families.  
• With those community partners, recruit and train a 
large cadre of volunteers to engage, support, mentor, 
and tutor students identified as vulnerable.  
• Adopt and aggressively implement school-wide 
strategies such as Restorative Justice, Positive 
Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and 
Social & Emotional Learning (SEL) that, when 
implemented rigorously, have demonstrated capacity 
to significantly reduce disciplinary incidents and 
increase student achievement.AN ACTION AGENDA
IMMEDIATE HELP FOR VULNERABLE 
STUDENTS
The first focus must be an all-out effort to re-engage 
and support children returning to school after more 
than a year of pandemic-fueled isolation, learning loss, 
missed adolescent development opportunities and in 
some cases trauma. Working with community partners, 
school systems must pull out all the stops to identify 
and reach out to students who have disconnected from 
school and others who are at high risk of dropout or 
failure. They must also put an immediate halt to 
exclusionary discipline: students have already missed 
enough school.
Specifically, these efforts should focus on four priorities.
1. Identify students at highest risk for disengagement 
or failure in the new school year
• Determine which students did not engage 
consistently in remote learning during 2020-21 or 
did not consistently attend in-school instruction, 
including those whose families have lost their 
housing during the pandemic.
To meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of this pivotal moment, states 
and local school systems must partner with their communities to pursue a two-
track approach focused on (a) re-engaging adolescents and helping them to catch 
up on their studies and succeed in the coming school year; and (b) closing the 
school-to-prison pipeline over time by fundamentally revamping schools’ long-term 
approaches to addressing student misbehavior and fostering success equitably 
for all students.Back-to-School Action Guide 213. Vastly restrict exclusionary discipline and arrests 
at school
• Given the huge loss in learning during the pandemic 
and the increase in children’s stress and anxiety, 
leaders in education and the justice system should 
prohibit arrests during the new school year and rule 
out suspensions and expulsions as a consequence 
for all but the most serious misbehavior involving 
danger to self or others.
• Instead, from the very first day of the 2021-22 
academic year, schools should address students’ 
predictable problem misbehavior with counseling, 
restorative justice processes and other alternative 
responses – while keeping youth out of the justice 
system.
• Schools and juvenile courts must also refrain from 
filing truancy charges against youth with poor 
attendance. With the help of community partners, 
schools should instead work with these young 
people to identify and address barriers to school 
participation.
4. Make racial and ethnic equity a top priority
• If they are not doing so already, schools must begin 
collecting and analyzing data to gain understanding 
about how and why the pandemic worsened the 
education system’s already grave disparities. How 
did children from various racial and ethnic groups 
differ in the type of instruction offered, attendance 
and participation, completion of assigned lessons. 
How did children from low-income families differ 
on these measures, or children attending schools 
with high concentrations of low-income students? 
What can be learned from surveys of parents and 
children about how students with different race, 
ethnicity, or income level experienced school since 
the pandemic began in March 2020? What actions 
must be taken immediately and in the long-term to 
remedy the disparities identified?
• Review school system policies and practices to 
examine how they might have contributed to the very unequal outcomes exacerbated during the 
pandemic, and to examine options for revamping 
longstanding practices that perpetuate racial and 
ethnic disparities. Consider new strategies that 
might enhance the opportunities and success rates 
of students most severely harmed through 
disruptions caused by the pandemic.
• Identify gaps in current programs and services for 
young people with emotional and behavioral issues 
and other special needs, and adopt new strategies 
to ensure that – as required under the federal 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act – these 
young people (and their families) receive the support 
they need to participate fully in school. As necessary, 
use federal relief funds to pay community providers 
to offer needed services that are beyond the capacity 
of existing school district programs and personnel.
PERMANENT SHIFT TO PRIORITIZE 
OPPORTUNITY, NOT PUNISHMENT
The second core goal for school systems and their 
community partners should be to use the current 
opportunity – the enormous sum of federal funds, and 
the heightened national focus on racial equity – to 
spark a permanent shift in discipline and other education 
practices. Now is the time to close the school-to-prison 
pipeline and to institutionalize effective alternative 
strategies that foster students’ success and address 
behavior problems constructively. Here the key priorities 
must be to:
Permanently close the school-to-prison pipeline
• Minimize arrests in the long-term by eliminating or 
vastly reducing the presence of SROs and other law 
enforcement personnel stationed in schools, and 
by creating school-justice partnerships to ensure 
that youth are not arrested at school except in 
dangerous, extreme situations.
• Reduce the use of exclusionary discipline by 
rewriting the school discipline code to minimize 
suspension and expulsions.
 22  The Sentencing Project• Adopt Restorative Justice as the guiding principle 
for addressing school discipline issues, and craft a 
continuum of therapeutic and developmentally 
appropriate responses to misbehavior.
Embrace the community school model
• Forging close connections with community 
organizations and residents and making school 
buildings a hub for a wide array of services and 
enrichment activities not only enhance the quality 
of life for students and their families; by enhancing 
the school climate, embracing a community school 
approach also leads to better academic outcomes 
for school children. A prestigious panel of experts 
wrote earlier this year that the pandemic has created 
a “once-in-a-century opportunity to reimagine school 
in ways that nurture the gifts and talents of every 
child and family. ”120 
• Further improve school climate by investing the 
time and resources necessary to institutionalize 
school-wide strategies like PBIS and Social and 
Emotional Learning, in addition to Restorative 
Justice.
• Connect youth to high quality positive youth 
development programming in the community during 
afterschool and weekend hours, and in summer.
Help Vulnerable Students Succeed
• Not just in 2021-22 but also in every subsequent 
year, school systems must partner with community 
organizations and invest in proven and promising 
strategies to re-engage students who are chronically 
absent.
• Offer intensive tutoring and other promising 
interventions to help students who are falling behind 
academically accelerate their learning, catch up 
with their peers, and strengthen their commitment 
to attending and thriving in school.• Provide supportive in-school programming to boost 
social and emotional learning among vulnerable 
students and increase their odds of future success
• Provide intensive assistance to help re-enroll 
children whose families lost housing during the 
pandemic and those who were previously unenrolled 
due to placements into residential care, group 
homes, and incarceration. Schools should make 
sure these youth receive credit for all courses they 
completed while studying in an alternative setting. Back-to-School Action Guide 23In addition to all of the death, misery, and disruption 
the covid-19 virus has inflicted, the pandemic has 
wreaked havoc on the educational progress and healthy 
maturation of America’s school population: so much 
learning loss, so much disengagement, so many lost 
opportunities for adolescents to participate in the 
essential rites of passage that allow them to transition 
successfully into adulthood.
Even more worrisome is the certainty that the setbacks 
suffered by children and adolescents thus far in the 
pandemic will become permanent anchors on their 
futures if our nation fails to re-engage students in school 
and help them recover lost learning – or worse yet, if 
we arrest or push students out of school for predictable 
behavioral problems as they return to classrooms.
Fortunately, as detailed in this report, the current 
moment has presented America’s schools and 
communities with an immense, historic opportunity not 
only to avert these disastrous outcomes in the short-
term, but also to initiate a deeper transformation in our 
nation’s schools for the long-term. Using the federal 
relief funds and our ever-expanding knowledge base, 
we have all the tools and resources we need to dismantle 
the counterproductive discipline regimes of the past 
and adopt a new model that responds constructively 
to misbehavior and fosters success for all students.
This opportunity requires schools to embrace community 
partners as never before. It requires community 
organizations, as well as parents and community 
residents and their advocates, to have a seat at the 
table in discussions about how schools work with 
students and families, and how they ensure success 
for vulnerable student populations (children of color, 
low-income children, children with special needs) who 
often have not been effectively served until now.
If schools and communities work together, if they heed 
the evidence and act strategically, a terrible crisis can 
give rise to historic opportunity.CONCLUSION
Using the federal relief funds and 
our ever-expanding knowledge base, 
we have all the tools and resources 
we need to dismantle the 
counterproductive discipline 
regimes of the past and adopt a new 
model that responds constructively 
to misbehavior and fosters success
