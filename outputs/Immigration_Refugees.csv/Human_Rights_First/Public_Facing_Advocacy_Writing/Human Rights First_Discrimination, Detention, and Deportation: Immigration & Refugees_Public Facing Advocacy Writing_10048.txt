Each refugee story and experience is different; collectively, they show the resiliency and strength of the human spirit. With these interviews we are celebrating and memorializing these individual stories. This project was made possible through a grant with The New School, whose history is rooted in principles of academic freedom, tolerance and social engagement.Refugee Stories: Lev SviridovInterviewing Lev and hearing his story was profound. Lev and his mother didn’t have a home when they decided to stay in the United States undocumented. Together they found ways to survive while “living in the shadows” as Lev put it. Working with Human Rights First they were able to gain citizenship and build their lives here. Growing up as a first-generation American, it was an honor and privilege for me to hear and record Lev’s story.—Kristin Sztyk, Director & EditorMA Candidate, Media Studies at The New SchoolPart 01, A Ticket OutPart 02, A Decision to StayPart 03, A Choice to LiveRefugee Stories: Myra DahgaypawIn completing the “Refugee Stories” project, we wanted to express how the refugee experience embodies essential values of strength and courage. These videos tell the story of how refugees have been able to rebuild their lives in the US after overcoming their displacement.The experience of listening to Myra’s story was inspiring. She had experienced a lot of difficulties before arriving in the United States. But that did not hold her back when it came to helping others and doing advocacy work for the Burmese community. It was an enriching experience to get to know her story.This project was completed through a grant with The New School, whose history is rooted in principles of academic freedom, tolerance and social engagement.Cristina Müller, Director & EditorMA Candidate, Media Studies at The New SchoolPart 01, DisplacementPart 02, AsylumPart 03, IdentityBlogPublished on December 7, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
