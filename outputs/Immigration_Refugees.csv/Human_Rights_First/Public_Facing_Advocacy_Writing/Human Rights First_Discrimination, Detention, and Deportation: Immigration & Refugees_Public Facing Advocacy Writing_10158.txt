And whether a parent, a sibling, a neighbor, or friend, they proudly play the role of citizen AND soldier. Meet Sarah Feinberg, a U.S. Marine veteran, a mother, and a Christian. She supports refugees.Sarah was a captain in the Marine Corps, and her service included a tour in Iraq. After leaving the Marine Corps, starting a family, and beginning a new career in Virginia, she was disturbed to watch the rising anti-Muslim bigotry and anti-refugee fear mongering that accompanied the election. She felt it violated both her faith and American ideals to turn our backs on those in need.So her family decided instead of selling their old home, they would offer it up to a refugee family. Their church, The Church of the Resurrection, filled it with donated furniture and home goods.Soon Arif, a former interpreter for USAID in Afghanistan, moved in with his family. While being vetted for over a year to get approved for the Special Immigrant Visa program, they lived in hiding from the Taliban. Arif’s children didn’t go outside for an entire year. Now Sarah and Arif’s son play together.“My husband and I decided it was important for us to take a stand on this issue because this defines us as Americans, it defines us as Christians,” Sarah says.Veterans for American Ideals, a project of Human Rights First, empowers veterans to challenge the United States to live up to the ideals that inspired them to serve in the first place. We are focused on protecting refugees, preserving the Special Immigrant Visa program for interpreters and translators who served U.S. forces, and countering anti-Muslim bigotry.WATCH VIDEOWATCH VIDEOBlogPublished on February 16, 2017ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
