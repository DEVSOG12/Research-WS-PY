The ruling will halt the ban on admission of refugees with bona fide relationships in the United States, including family members of refugees currently in the United States who are part of the U.S. refugee resettlement follow-to-join program.“Once again the courts see straight through the Trump Administration’s veiled attempts to discriminate against vulnerable refugees and tear apart families. We welcome Judge Robart’s decision, which will continue to allow those fleeing violence and persecution to find safety in the United States,” said Human Rights First’s Hary Vieux. “Welcoming refugees and keeping families together is not only a moral imperative but is good for our country’s national security– supporting allies strained by the challenges of the global refugee crisis.”The decision follows a December 21 hearing of two challenges to the Trump Administration’s October 25 ban on refugees. The first challenge was brought by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP); the National Immigration Law Center (NILC); Lauren Aguiar, Mollie M. Kornreich, and Abigail Shaheen Davis; Perkins Coie LLP; and HIAS on behalf of Jewish Family Service of Seattle, Jewish Family Services of Silicon Valley, and individual plaintiffs. The second challenge was brought by the ACLU of Washington, on behalf of a refugee living in Washington state who seeks to be reunited with his family.PressPublished on December 24, 2017ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
