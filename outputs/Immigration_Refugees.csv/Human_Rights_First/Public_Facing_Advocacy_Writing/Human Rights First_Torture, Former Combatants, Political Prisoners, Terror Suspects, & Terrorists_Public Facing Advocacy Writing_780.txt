In the coming days, I hope to see the United States and EU – along with the United Kingdom and Canada – continue to collaborate to hold accountable all Russian officials known to have been involved in and responsible for Navalny’s poisoning and arbitrary detention.”Human Rights First applauds the EU’s 27 member states for coming together to unanimously condemn the illicit actions of the Russian government and encourages continued and robust implementation of the regime against other human rights abusers across the globe.Today’s multilateral sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that committing serious human rights abuses in an effort to uphold Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regime are a dangerous affront to international norms and will be met with significant consequences.PressPublished on March 2, 2021ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsAuthoritarianism-Global Magnitsky and Targeted Sanctions24 International Organizations Call for Global Magnitsky Sanctions on Authoritarian Regimes Seeking to Exploit Coronavirus PandemicJuly 9, 2020 ⎯ The Sentry, Human Right First, and Freedom House joined with twenty-one other non-governmental organizations today in urging the United States government…PressAuthoritarianism-Global Magnitsky and Targeted SanctionsAtrocities in Ukraine Underscore Need To Reauthorize Strengthened Global Magnitsky ActWASHINGTON D.C. – Human Rights First, Freedom House, and 56 other civil society groups issued a joint letter today calling on the U.S. Congress to…PressAuthoritarianism-Global Magnitsky and Targeted SanctionsBerschinski Testifies Before European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human RightsWashington, D.C.—Today, in a hearing before the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, Human Rights First Senior Vice President for Policy Rob Berschinski outlined recommendations…PressAuthoritarianism-Global Magnitsky and Targeted SanctionsFrom Magnitsky to the Mothers of Mariupol: Congress Must Stand with Victims and Strengthen the Global Magnitsky ActIn recent weeks, the world has once again been confronted with the horrifying reality of war and witnessed shocking crimes in Ukraine.
