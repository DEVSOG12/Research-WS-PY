Jerry Nadler (D-NY) introduced the Keep Families Together Act, legislation that addresses the Trump Administration’s cruel policies that rips families apart at the border. In response, Human Rights First’s Jennifer Quigley issued the following statement:As the administration ramps up its disgusting attacks on those desperately seeking protection by tearing apart families and sending children to prison camps, members of Congress have stepped up to restore fairness and humanity in our asylum system. We applaud Rep. Nadler for introducing legislation that gets to the heart of this issue by preventing the administration from separating children from their parents.Today’s legislation was cosponsored by Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Ted W. Lieu (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) and House Democratic leadership.PressPublished on June 19, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
