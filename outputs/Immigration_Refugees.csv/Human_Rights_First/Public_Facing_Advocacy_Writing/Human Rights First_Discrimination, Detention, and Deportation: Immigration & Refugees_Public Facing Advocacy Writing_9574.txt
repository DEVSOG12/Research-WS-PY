From ensuring accountability for Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations to promoting transparency and oversight in use of force operations to limiting the role of the military in immigration enforcement, the House version of the defense bill advances critical human rights priorities at a time when American leadership on human rights is sorely needed.The House version of the defense bill would:Enable greater flexibility for transferring detainees out of the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba;Reinstate and strengthen critical reporting requirements on civilian harm caused by U.S. operations;Prohibit the military from engaging in immigration detention;require that any housing of unaccompanied minor migrants in military facilities meets the care of custody guidelines;Impose sanctions on Saudi officials responsible for the murder of Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi;Restrict U.S. military support for the war in Yemen;Protect immigrants who have served in or aided the military;Ensure equality under the law for transgender servicemembers; and,Curtail the executive branch’s abuse of war authorizations that could harm human rights, including by repealing the out-of-date 2002 Iraq War authorization, expressing concern about the stretching of the 2001 9/11 authorization, and emphasizing the importance of imposing clear limits on any new authorizations.Human Rights First supports these important human rights provisions, and in many cases developed policy recommendations that are reflected in them. The House and Senate will now proceed to conference negotiations to produce a final defense bill. Human Rights First will fight to ensure that these critical human rights priorities are reflected in that final bill.For more information or to speak with McBride contact Corinne Duffy at [email protected] or 202-370-3319.PressPublished on July 12, 2019ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
