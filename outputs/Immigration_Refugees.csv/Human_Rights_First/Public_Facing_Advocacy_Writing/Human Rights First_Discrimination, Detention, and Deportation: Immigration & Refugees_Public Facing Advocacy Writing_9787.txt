They made history, changing the narrative of rock and roll in Music City.Roots Radio NewsThe Book Of Daniel, Nashville Edition, On The StringCraig HavighurstIn our continuing effort to document key music-makers whose headline space doesn’t measure up to their behind-the-scenes contributions, I found myself talking this fall to two guys named Daniel whose accomplishments and esthetics seem to complement one another. Dan Knobler moved to Nashville from New York and quickly became one of the most admired producers of Americana and folk music. Daniel Tashian has lived in Music City basically all his life, building a circle of influence as a songwriter, artist, and producer, culminating in the Grammy Award he shared for making 2018’s Album of the Year, Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves. Both gentlemen have released new albums with cool stories, and we talk about them in this co-headlining episode.Roots Radio NewsEmerging Americana: Nora Brown, Tray Wellington and Taylor RaeCraig HavighurstAmericanaFest 2022 is in the books, and even more than usual, I came away with a backlog of fascinating conversations with artists who don’t live in Nashville but who are making an impact on roots music. This week’s show features highlights from three interviews with emerging talent in the veins of traditional old-time, modern bluegrass and folk-rock. There’s no such thing as a representative sample of the format’s younger generation, but between Tray Wellington, Nora Brown and Taylor Rae, there are plenty of storylines that will unfold and develop in the years to come.Listen • 59:00Roots Radio NewsFinally Friday Features The Blue Dogs, Mary Bragg and Gabe LeeCraig HavighurstFollow up your Manic Monday, your Taxing Tuesday, your Weird Wednesday and your Thankless Thursday with Finally Friday!
