In many cases, the people impacted are trying to leave countries that have been plagued by human rights abuses and conflict. Once again, the administration tried to dress up its discriminatory and xenophobic policies in the language of national security.”In addition to suspending the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria, as well as visas available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States including Sudan and Tanzania, Human Rights First is concerned that the ban would lead to the continued separation of families. The proclamation appears to apply to I-130 petitions which allow U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents (LPRs) – including a refugee or asylee who is already a U.S. citizen or LPR – to petition to bring a family member to the United States.PressPublished on January 31, 2020ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
