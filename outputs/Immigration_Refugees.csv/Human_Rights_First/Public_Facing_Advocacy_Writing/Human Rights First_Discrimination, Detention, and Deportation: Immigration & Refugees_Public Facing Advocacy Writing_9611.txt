Threatening critical funding for the government to build a senseless wall without addressing key border security issues harms, rather than helps, our national security. And denying basic protections to vulnerable people, including women and children, who are seeking asylum at the border only further erodes our commitment to basic human rights and American values.The United States has the world’s most powerful, professional, and well-resourced law enforcement and homeland security agencies; it’s absurd to think that we cannot safely offer protection to individuals who openly present themselves at our border to seek asylum.For more information or to speak with Olsen contact Corinne Duffy at [email protected] or 202-370-3319.PressPublished on February 15, 2019ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
