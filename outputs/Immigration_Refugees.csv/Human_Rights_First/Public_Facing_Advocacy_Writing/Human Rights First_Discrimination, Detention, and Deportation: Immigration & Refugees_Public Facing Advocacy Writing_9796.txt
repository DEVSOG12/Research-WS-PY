Paxton and other Texas brass joined a group of more than 30 state -level leaders who sought to bar Syrians from being resettled in Texas, in part in reaction to the devastating terror attacks in Paris (none of the attackers were Syrians or refugees, however).Paxton’s withdrawal comes just after another federal court shut down a similar anti-refugee policy in Indiana. That decision, handed down by 7th Circuit judge Richard Posner, issued a harsh reprimand of Indiana Governor Mike Pence, calling his attempt to block Syrian refugee resettlement due to alleged security concerns mere “nightmare speculation.”Undoubtedly fearful of a similar rebuke, Texas officials retreated from their quest to bar Syrians from resettling there, yet held fast to Governor Gregg Abbott’s plan to remove the state from the federal refugee program entirely. Though the Texas government will no longer play a role in the program, refugees, including Syrians, will continue to be resettled in the state by private organizations.Since 2011, Texas has become home to over 1000 Syrian refugees, and none have lived up to any “nightmare speculation.” In fact, no Syrian refugee has ever been accused of plotting terrorism in the United States. Rather, the new Texans have largely been model citizens.This information seems unconvincing to Texas lawmakers, who still have reservations about the refugee security screening process despite the analysis of our top national security experts and military leadership. That process, which includes a dizzying series of personal interviews, rigorous background checks, and biometric data screening, takes place before refugees step foot on American soil, making refugees the most vetted individuals to ever enter the country.Breaking with their top leaders, many Texans have instead chosen to welcome refugees with their famous southern hospitality. Joining them last week was former ambassador to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan Ryan Crocker and dean of the George W. Bush School of Government at Texas A&M.“A sad result of this heated and confusing campaign season is that Syrian refugees have become mingled in people’s minds with their oppressors,” Crocker told the Houston Chronicle. “Syrians, along with Iraqis, are the primary victims of ISIS. As a former ambassador to Syria, I know the country well . . . Syrians are precisely the kind of people I’d want living in my community and attending my child’s schools.”For Crocker and countless other Texans, the importance of welcoming refugees is clear. Now, it’s up to the state’s leadership to heed the advice of national experts and the compassionate calls of its own citizens and make Texas a leader, rather than a barrier, in solving the world’s refugee crisis.BlogPublished on October 13, 2016ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
