The bill was approved by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in what should be seen as a sharp rebuke of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Donald Trump’s plans to drastically cut the United States’ diplomatic power abroad. The legislation signals bipartisan congressional support for diplomacy and foreign assistance as key tools of U.S. influence abroad, and will require significant oversight of any re-organization plans to ensure that they do not erode America’s diplomatic and development capacity. The bill is expected to pass the full committee tomorrow.“Today, members of the Senate from both parties sent a strong signal to President Trump and Secretary Tillerson that they will not stand by as these men undercut the ability of the State Department and USAID to advance America’s interests abroad,” said Human Rights First’s Rob Berschinski. “Congress essentially told the administration that not only can they not weaken the State Department through severe budget cuts, they also can’t act unilaterally to modify its structure. It’s a strong rebuke.”Earlier this year, the Trump Administration requested a 30 percent cut in the State Department’s funding, which would reduce their annual budget to $37.6 billion, a figure that would severely diminish the agency’s capacity. Today’s press release from State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Thad Cochran (R-MS), however, indicates congressional support for an FY18 funding bill with a budget of $51.2 billion, which is roughly on par with previous years’ funding levels. The bill specifically mandates maintaining funding for State Department and USAID personnel levels “consistent with prior fiscal years,” and would prohibit using any funds to move the latter under control of the former.PressPublished on September 6, 2017ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsExtremism-Antisemitism120 Members of Bipartisan Taskforce Urge Pompeo to Fill Anti-Semitism Special Envoy PositionBy Susan Corke and Mazarine Lestienne Over the past 16 months, members of Congress, civil society, former senior government officials, Jewish and other religious leaders,…BlogExtremism-AntisemitismLetter on “United We Stand” eventDear Ambassador Rice, We applaud the administration’s efforts to address hate through the upcoming summit, United We Stand: Countering Hate-Fueled Violence Together.
