The Biden administration must immediately change course or risk a permanent stain on their record of upholding human rights.”The letter warns that while the administration has committed to advancing racial equity in all parts of the government, this commitment is belied by actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security at the southern border through the continuation of Title 42 expulsions as well as deportation flights to Haiti and other nations, without any screening for asylum eligibility, which is required under U.S. law.Human Rights First and the Haitian Bridge Alliance released a fact sheet on Tuesday on the Biden administration’s dangerous Haitian expulsion strategy, and the U.S. history of illegal and discriminatory mistreatment of Haitians seeking safety in the United States.Mr. Breen joined other signatories, including Sherrilyn Ifill, President and Director-Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF); Wade Henderson, Interim President and CEO, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Kenneth Roth, Executive Director, Human Rights Watch, and many others.PressPublished on September 22, 2021ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. Asylum5th Circuit Amicus Brief in State of Texas, State of Missouri v Biden: HRF Opposes MPP on the MeritsAmicus BriefsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Shameful Record: Biden Administration’s Use of Trump Policies Endangers People Seeking AsylumReportsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Sordid Scheme: The Trump Administration’s Illegal Return of Asylum Seekers to MexicoOn January 29, 2019, the Trump Administration began implementing its perversely dubbed “Migration Protection Protocols.” In reality, this policy is about denying—not providing—protection to refugees,…ReportsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Year After Del Rio, Haitian Asylum Seekers Expelled Under Title 42 Are Still SufferingIt’s now been a year since the U.S. government launched its “comprehensive strategy” in September 2021 that resulted in the mass expulsion of Haitian people…LetterSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Year of Horrors: The Trump Administration’s Illegal Returns of Asylum Seekers to Danger in MexicoSince January 2019, the Trump Administration has forcibly returned thousands of asylum seekers to Mexico under a policy it absurdly dubbed as the “Migrant Protection…ReportsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumAfter Appeals Court Stay, Human Rights First Renews Call for Biden Administration to End Trump Expulsion PolicyNEW YORK – In the wake of an appeals court order yesterday, Human Rights First reiterated its calls for the Biden administration to stop defending the…PressSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumAfter Two Years, Biden Must End Migrant Protection Protocols and Bring Asylum Seekers Swiftly to SafetyWASHINGTON – Today marks the second anniversary of the Trump administration’s so-called “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP), also known as “Remain in Mexico,” which forced thousands of…PressSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumAmicus brief: Lousiana v.
