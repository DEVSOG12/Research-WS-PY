At a number of official ports of entry along the southern border, some Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have improperly turned away asylum seekers without referring them, as required by law, for protection screening interviews.Unduly high screening standards. A new lesson plan relating to credible fear of persecution or torture, issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in February 2017 in the wake of the January 25 executive order, includes revisions that are inconsistent with U.S. law and put people at risk of return to persecution or torture.Escalating detention and failure to parole eligible asylum seekers. The president’s January 25 executive order calls for an escalation of immigration detention, which is already at an all-time high.“The Department of Homeland Security can—and must—both safeguard U.S. borders and protect the persecuted. Secretary Kelly should take steps to ensure that all DHS officers understand that they must faithfully implement laws and policies relating to asylum, ” added Acer.PressPublished on April 5, 2017ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
