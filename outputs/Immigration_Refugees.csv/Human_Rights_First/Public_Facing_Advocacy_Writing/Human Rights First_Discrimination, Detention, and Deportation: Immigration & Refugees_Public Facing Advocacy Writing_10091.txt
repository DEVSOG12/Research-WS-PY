Since 2008, the number of submitted asylum applications throughout the world grew by 126%. The reason behind the rise in credible fear claims, however, is not migrants exploiting the U.S. asylum law, but an increased number of refugees.Since 2008, the global number of refugees increased by 67%—reaching an astounding 25.4 million people at the end of 2017.Recently, the United States, along with Belize, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama, have been particularly prone to increases in credible fear claims due to significant increase in refugees stemming from neighboring countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Central America had a 58% increase in refugees from 2016 to 2017. It only makes sense that the number of people claiming credible fear increases as the number of refugees increase.The purported factsheet also points out an increase in pending asylum applications, creating a large backlog in the immigration courts. The White House, again, blames this on migrants exploiting U.S. laws. If the increase truly was caused by loopholes in U.S. asylum laws, this issue would be unique to the United States. However, the global number of pending asylum cases has seen a 273.75% increase over the past 10 years.These false claims administered by the White House show their utter disregard for human rights. Instead of protecting people who fear for their lives, the Trump Administration is misrepresenting numbers to serve their anti-immigration agenda. There simply is no evidence that refugees exploit U.S. asylum laws. The White House’s flagrant dishonesty only adds to the suffering of the world’s most vulnerable people.BlogPublished on June 20, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
