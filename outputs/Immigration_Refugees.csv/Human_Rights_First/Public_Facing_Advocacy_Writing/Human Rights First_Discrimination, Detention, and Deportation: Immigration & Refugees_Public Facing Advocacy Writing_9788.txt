For the men, women, and children who have fled violence and trauma in their home countries, having a lawyer can mean the difference between living in safety or a return to persecution.”Through Human Rights First’s refugee representation program, volunteer lawyers have the opportunity to change the lives of refugees by helping them gain asylum in the United States. The organization matches asylum seekers who need help with lawyers who can represent them on a pro bono basis. Human Rights First provides mentoring, training, and guidance throughout the process to ensure that the pro bono lawyers get the support they need to provide the highest quality legal representation to clients seeking asylum.Since its inception in 1965, the Texas Bar Foundation has awarded more than $18 million in grants to law-related programs. Supported by members of the State Bar of Texas, the Texas Bar Foundation is the nation’s largest charitably-funded bar foundation.PressPublished on May 25, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
