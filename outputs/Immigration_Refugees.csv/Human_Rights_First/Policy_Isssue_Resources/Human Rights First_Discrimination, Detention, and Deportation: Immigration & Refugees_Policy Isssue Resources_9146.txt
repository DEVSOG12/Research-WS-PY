The COVID-19 pandemic made the horrors of detention all the more apparent: the government’s failure to release many immigrants from immigration detention centers led to widespread disease transmission, death, and serious illness.In addition to inflicting harm, immigration detention is costly and unnecessary. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is not required under U.S. law to detain asylum seekers and has existing legal authority to release people to communities where they can safely live with family and friends to wait for their cases to be decided.Detention of asylum seekers flouts U.S. legal obligations under the Refugee Convention and Protocol. In its guidelines on the use of detention, the U.N. Refugee agency (UNHCR) has confirmed the general principle that “asylum-seekers should not be detained” and that “the use of detention is, in many instances, contrary to the norms and principles of international law.”People seeking protection at the border can be released pending adjudication of their casesDHS has existing legal authority to place asylum seekers who request protection at the United States border whether at or between ports of entry into regular removal proceedings and to release these families and individuals to wait for court proceedings in the community, rather than subject them to detention and expedited removal—an extremely flawed process that risks returning refugees to persecution and torture. They can be released on parole – a legal mechanism through which DHS can process an individual into the United States for humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit to avoid the use of detention. In addition, asylum seekers who have been subjected to expedited removal and received a positive credible fear determination can also be released from custody on parole under the 2009 DHS Parole Directive, if they establish their identity and demonstrate they are not a flight or security risk.While DHS has discretion to set additional conditions when granting parole, given that the overwhelming majority of asylum seekers appear for their immigration hearings, the agency should avoid the imposition of cruel and unnecessary restrictive monitoring conditions, such as the use of ankle shackles. Ankle shackles inflict enormous physical and psychological harm, result in social isolation and employment discrimination, are disproportionately used against Black immigrants, and, like detention, are unnecessary and ineffective.Detention of asylum seekers is unnecessary to ensure appearance at court hearings and wastes government resourcesStudies have repeatedly confirmed that asylum seekers overwhelmingly appear for hearings after they are released from DHS custody, rendering the use of costly immigration detention unnecessary to ensure future appearance. Appearance rates are even higher where asylum seekers are represented by counsel. For example, 96 percent of non-detained immigrants represented by a lawyer attended all of their hearings from 2008 to 2018.In addition to being unnecessary, detention is fiscally wasteful. Community-based case management alternatives are far less costly, as well as more humane and effective. For instance, a family case management program piloted by DHS from January 2016 to June 2017 demonstrated high levels of success, including a 99 percent appearance rate for hearings. This program cost about $36 a day per family while family detention costs almost $320 a day per person in family detention centers.____________________________[1] The administration can refer asylum seekers for full asylum interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers in their destination locations, ramping up asylum office staffing to fully adjudicate asylum requests, which will result in quicker initial decisions and reduce the number of individuals ultimately referred to immigration court hearings. These full asylum office adjudications should not be conducted within the expedited removal process, which would limit due process.DOWNLOADDownload the FactsheetDownload the FactsheetFact SheetsPublished on July 14, 2021ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. Asylum5th Circuit Amicus Brief in State of Texas, State of Missouri v Biden: HRF Opposes MPP on the MeritsAmicus BriefsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Shameful Record: Biden Administration’s Use of Trump Policies Endangers People Seeking AsylumReportsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Sordid Scheme: The Trump Administration’s Illegal Return of Asylum Seekers to MexicoOn January 29, 2019, the Trump Administration began implementing its perversely dubbed “Migration Protection Protocols.” In reality, this policy is about denying—not providing—protection to refugees,…ReportsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Year After Del Rio, Haitian Asylum Seekers Expelled Under Title 42 Are Still SufferingIt’s now been a year since the U.S. government launched its “comprehensive strategy” in September 2021 that resulted in the mass expulsion of Haitian people…LetterSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumA Year of Horrors: The Trump Administration’s Illegal Returns of Asylum Seekers to Danger in MexicoSince January 2019, the Trump Administration has forcibly returned thousands of asylum seekers to Mexico under a policy it absurdly dubbed as the “Migrant Protection…ReportsSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumAfter Appeals Court Stay, Human Rights First Renews Call for Biden Administration to End Trump Expulsion PolicyNEW YORK – In the wake of an appeals court order yesterday, Human Rights First reiterated its calls for the Biden administration to stop defending the…PressSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumAfter Two Years, Biden Must End Migrant Protection Protocols and Bring Asylum Seekers Swiftly to SafetyWASHINGTON – Today marks the second anniversary of the Trump administration’s so-called “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP), also known as “Remain in Mexico,” which forced thousands of…PressSystemic Injustice-Access to U.S. AsylumAmicus brief: Lousiana v.
