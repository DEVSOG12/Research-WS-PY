Many of the proposals included in the White House’s principles and priorities have previously been introduced, but ultimately rejected, by Congress. Others have been ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts.If enacted into law or otherwise implemented, these provisions would block access to refugee protection in the United States, penalize asylum seekers, send children and other vulnerable asylum seekers back to danger, and severely damage the integrity of the U.S. immigration and asylum systems, undermining U.S. global leadership and interests.DOWNLOADDOWNLOADFact SheetsPublished on October 12, 2017ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedTake actionUrge Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment ActSign the petitionSubscribeFirst NameLast NameEmail AddressPlease leave this field empty.FinancialsAbout UsCareersJoin the WorkBoardEventsContactHuman Rights FirstHuman Rights First is a nonpartisan, 501(c)(3).
