Despite the low admissions ceiling, the administration resettled less than half of the refugees pledged for Fiscal Year 2018. During Fiscal Year 2018, the United States resettled 22,491 refugees, an almost 60% decrease from the 53,716 refugees settled during Fiscal Year 2017.Although there have been decreases in admissions across all religions, during Fiscal Year 2018, admissions for Muslims were down by 85% compared to Fiscal Year 2017. In Fiscal Year 2017, 43% of admitted refugees identified as Muslims, however in Fiscal Year 2018 only 16% of admitted refugees identified as Muslim.In the first months of 2018, President Trump implemented refugee bans, which barred refugees from 10 Muslim majority countries from entering the United States, only 598 refugees from the 11 banned countries were admitted to the U.S. during Fiscal Year 2018. In comparison, 23,357 refugees from the 11 banned countries were admitted during Fiscal Year 2017. Notably, only 140 Iraqis were admitted during Fiscal Year 2018, which includes U.S.-affiliated Iraqis who provided aide to our military and government. Currently the backlog for U.S.-affiliated Iraqis is approximately 100,000 people.Despite record breaking levels of global displacement, overall refugee admissions in the United States are down by almost 60% from last fiscal year. Notably, admissions from Near East and South Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean are experiencing large drops in admissions.DOWNLOADDOWNLOADPublished on October 3, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
