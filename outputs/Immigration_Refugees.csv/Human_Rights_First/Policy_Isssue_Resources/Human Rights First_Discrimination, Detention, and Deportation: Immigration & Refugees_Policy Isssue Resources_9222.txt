This effort escalated in response to weeks of public outcry against his administration’s policy of separating family units at the U.S.-Mexico border. In signing an executive order on June 20, 2018, the president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to request modification to the Flores settlement agreement that would increase the amount of time that children can be held in detention facilities.These “residential centers”—as described by asylum seekers who have spent months inside—are prisons. Families do not have the freedom to move around; children spend little to no time outside; food is often expired or rotten; the water makes them sick. Detainees are kept under secure conditions, surrounded by guards, instilling constant fear and anxiety in children and their families.Family incarceration has been criticized by a wide array of voices, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar Association, 178 representatives of the House and 35 senators, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and numerous faith groups.Where are Families Currently Being Detained?All three facilities are not currently state-licensed childcare facilities, as required by the Flores agreement.Berks Family Residential CenterA 96-bed facility in Berks County, PennsylvaniaKarnes Residential CenterAn 830-bed for-profit facility in Karnes City, TexasSouth Texas Family Residential CenterA 2,400-bed for-profit facility in Dilley, TexasDOwnloadDOwnloadFact SheetsPublished on August 20, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedTake actionUrge Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment ActSign the petitionSubscribeFirst NameLast NameEmail AddressPlease leave this field empty.FinancialsAbout UsCareersJoin the WorkBoardEventsContactHuman Rights FirstHuman Rights First is a nonpartisan, 501(c)(3).
