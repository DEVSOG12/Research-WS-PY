It also further exacerbates impediments to asylum and other immigration processes.The use of immigration detention has far-reaching negative consequences on health and the ability to establigh asylum or other eligibility. Many are held in remote locations where they cannot access legal counsel or communicate with relatives. Family members suffer the collateral effects associated with losing a primary breadwinner, parent, or guardian.Families and Children with Legal Counsel Are in Compliance Nearly 100 Percent of the TimeAccording to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), as of December 2017, 97 percent of represented mothers whose cases initiated in fiscal year (FY) 2014 were in compliance with their immigration court hearing obligations three years later.Similarly, 98 percent of children in immigration proceedings whose cases initiated in 2014 and who had obtained counsel were in full compliance with their court appearance obligations as of December 2017.TRAC data also showed, however, that 44% of mothers were not able to obtain legal counsel. Additionally, among the 57,678 cases of children that were filed before the immigration courts in 2014, 36 percent had not obtained legal representation by December 2017.Human Rights First and other groups have noted numerous reasons that immigrants and asylum seekers often lack legal representation.Many cannot afford legal counselThere is only very limited government funding for legal representation.Pro bono legal representation is scarce and over stretched.Asylum and immigration laws are exceedingly complex, and without legal representation eligible indivuals often cannot satisfy the stringent legal and evidentiary requirements.Statistics have shown that legal representation is the most important factor in determining whether an individual will succeed in their case.The Trump Administration and proponents of legislation that seeks to block funding for legal representation are trying to thwart access to counsel, which in turn will lead to lower appearance rates.DOWNLOADDOWNLOADFact SheetsPublished on February 9, 2018ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
