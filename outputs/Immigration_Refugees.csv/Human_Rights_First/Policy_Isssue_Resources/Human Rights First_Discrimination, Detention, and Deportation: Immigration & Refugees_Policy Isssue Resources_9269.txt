Over the last four years, the backlog of asylum applications pending with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) Asylum Division has risen sharply. As of September 2016, there were over 194,000 affirmative asylum cases pending, a dramatic increase from the 32,560 that were pending in 2013. Most people who file asylum applications with USCIS are waiting over two years, and many will wait longer, to have their asylum applications adjudicated by USCIS asylum officers.DownloadDownloadFact SheetsPublished on November 16, 2016ShareLinkedInFacebookTwitterShare LinkLink copiedRelated PostsSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection2017 Pro Bono Stars: HoustonBy Hardy Vieux As part of the American Bar Association’s Celebrate Pro Bono Week, we are recognizing individuals with outstanding dedication to pro bono service…BlogSystemic Injustice-Refugee ProtectionJoint Letter to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas & AG Garland on Title 42LetterSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection360 Videos Document Life for Asylum Seekers at U.S. BorderWashington, D.C.—As the Trump Administration ramps up its attacks on refugees and asylum seekers and threatens to designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” Human…PressSystemic Injustice-Refugee Protection5 Ways To Help Migrant Parents And Children At The BorderDonate to Human Rights First: Your donations help us provide free legal representation for asylum seeking families and children in court.
