Guzman ChavezThis amicus brief addresses the obligation of U.S. courts to construe federal statutes, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), in a manner consistent with the nation’s obligations under binding international treaties. This has been an established canon of statutory construction since Murray v. The Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64 (1804).INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTThis amicus brief addresses the obligation of U.S. courts to construe federal statutes, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), in a manner consistent with the nation’s obligations under binding international treaties. This has been an established canon of statutory construction since Murray v. The Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64 (1804). Applying that canon here, this Court should avoid an interpretation of the INA that allows for detention without a prompt individualized determination by a court, independent of the detaining authorities and capable of ordering release, that detention is reasonable, necessary and proportionate under the facts of the particular case.DOWNLOADInterest of AmiciHuman Rights First is a non-governmental organization established in 1978 that works to ensure U.S. leadership on human rights globally and compliance domestically with this country’s human rights commitments.
