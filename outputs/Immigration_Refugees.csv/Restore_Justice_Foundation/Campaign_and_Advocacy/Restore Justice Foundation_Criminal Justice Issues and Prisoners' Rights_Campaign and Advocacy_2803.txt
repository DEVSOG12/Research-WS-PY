To the extent these procedures require or allow for application by inmates, forms should be readily available in each facility, as well as on IDOC’s website.State’s attorneys can initiate sentence reduction for individuals their office’s prosecuted decades ago who may not be reviewed otherwise because of the time remaining to their exit dates.Review individuals whose cases involved statutes that have since been amended by the General Assembly (prospectively), including youth given extremely long sentences who today would be eligible for parole if the Youthful Parole Law, signed in 2019, had been applied retroactively.Review individuals who were convicted of murder or other violent offenses under a theory of accountability, or those convicted of felony-murder for the death of a co-defendent at the hands of a third party.Initiate resentencing hearings for anyone serving less than 5 years on a nonviolent offense.Our state must ensure a responsible exit process for those selected for early release.The Governor’s Office should appoint a “czar” to cut through administrative and other barriers to re-entry, including housing, and to ensure consistent communications and directions with partner organizations and the public.During the pandemic, Governor Pritzker should waive the policy that dictates front-line staff within IDOC must physically visit placements before re-entry. The state must address lags in 311 service, as it is the only means for many people seeking newly available COVID-19 housing. This is particularly important if it is the only point of access for workers seeking to find housing for returning citizens.Make re-entry housing needs a high priority of the Governor’s Office plan involving property managers, landlords, hotels, and colleges.Standards for COVID-19 response in prisons should mirror response in long-term care facilities.Where even one case has been confirmed, all staff and incarcerated people should receive personal protective equipment (PPE) and be given greater access to hygiene supplies and clean, safe quarantine facilities.IDOC must continue to increase access to supplies for cleaning cells and common areas and ensure proper use by staff.IDOC must develop better system-wide protocols for food preparation and delivery, and those protocols should be reviewed and approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health.IDOC must ensure basic medications are being delivered to people with pre-existing conditions.Incarcerated people’s family members, friends, and lawyers, as well as the general public, must be given adequate information about COVID19 spread and response in all Illinois facilities.IDOC must begin reporting testing numbers and deaths by facility.IDOC should begin reporting hospitalizations by facility.IDOC should report early releases weekly by facility, including percentages of those being released needing housing and rates of secured housing.The Governor’s Office should give periodic reports on medical furloughs.The Governor’s Office should require reports from each of Illinois’ 102 counties on protocols for public reporting on COVID-19 in jails, including juvenile facilities.Read our earlier recommendations here.23 CommentsDonna KellyPosted at 21:06h, 27 AprilReplyTo Gov.

I feel he should be released immediately because of coronavirus without any other technicalities..PLEASE!!Luke R SullivanPosted at 22:59h, 29 AprilReplyTo Governor Pritzker,I write you in the hopes that you read this in regards to my Father Richard, Currently part of the Statesville correctional facility. Ive been fortunate that the staff at the institution have allowed him multiple calls in the last few weeks after a month of nothing, No contact until a letter I received indicating his physical state, he has been locked in a cell for day after day no ability to leave and at the very least move about the facility breathe fresh air and not the recirculated virus cloud im sure that is the current . Hes 60 and up until being placed inside was a heavy smoker and has dealt with breathing issues pneumonia and lung infections, hes a prime candidate to get this terrible virus and based on your own health directors guidelines would suffer greatly should he contract it and im very concerned for his safety. If you sir are serious about saving lives then why leave people crammed into jails especially older portions of the population, I ask you to consider his selection for early release before this pandemic claims another life, one that is easily avoided and allow him to show that your gracious ruling is not in vain. He has been a loyal tax paying citizen who has worked himself hard and has paid the price for it, I would ask that you don’t let the virus be the ultimate form of punishment and be the caring politician your news briefings make you out to be. Thank and I hope this reaches you sooner rather then laterRegards,LukeDonna L.

He is currently housed at Lawrence correctional center under the inmate name Andre. His current released date is 7/21/2020 but originally was to be released back on 1/21/2020. He was at Shawnee Correctional Center in 2017 where he was disciplined n solitary confinement for 6 months and was given 6 months additional time making his new release date 07/21/2020. The disciplinary occurrence at Shawnee and was charged and found guilty unfairly. He was accused of having marijuana in his cell and after drug testing him came back inconclusive, the searched his cell and found nothing. Internal Affairs pressed him to implicate me his fiance as an accomplice to bringing him drugs into a state prison. He again denied he had any drugs and also denied the accusations implicating his fiance had brought drugs to the prison. After the investigation they sent him to Solitary confinement for 6 months saying he was with holding info for this case and band me his fiance (Maud) from visiting him at any IDOC prison. We asked for another investigation because this was inaccurate and they kept giving us the round around. Eventually we gave up and i have not seen my fiance physically for over 3 years now. he has been in prison since 2014. ( I do believe this is illegal and if any real evidence indicated I did such a thing i would be in prison myself). I have never been incarcerated ever. I believe my husband was wrongfully given an extended time to remain in the jail and would appreciate an immediate release due to COVID19 and error on IDOC processing.Erica DavisPosted at 04:24h, 07 MayReplyAttention Gov.

Ronald has been incarcerated for over 10 years now and has since grown to be a much better person. He’s obtained a G.E.D, business degree and many other certificates. He’s also been promised a good, stable job upon his release. I’m certain you understand that times are especially difficult now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That being said, I’m becoming very concerned of the state and safety of Ronald’s well-being in prison. The conditions there are terrible and are a huge risk to the health of guards and prisoners. I’m sincerely asking you take the time to consider granting Ronald’s release during this time. I hope this information is enough to prove to you my cousin’s improvement and how much of an asset he will become to this society. Thank you so much for your consideration and time.

Fortunately, nobody was hurt. Zach is appealing this because: Nobody was in the house and Zach was in the backseat of a car. Some witnesses at trial testified to this. His sentence is 23 years at 50% and will have served 5 years this June. I have read about similar or worse circumstances where the individuals received a substantially lower sentence. Zacharyis currently confined at Gramham Correctional Center and feels like he received the death sentence because of the pandemic. Our country also has a problem with mass incarceration and in great need of Criminal Justice Reform. My son is a non-violent, low-level offender without any ties to any criminal organizations or gangs. My son has no criminal history. Anyone who has spent time with Zach will tell you he follows the rules, is respectful and hasn’t caused any problems. I believe this experience of spending time in prison has saved my son’s life. He was an addict, another statistic in our opioid epidemic. He has persevered through some very tough times. Now he is 5 years sober, found his faith again in God, helps others, is writing a book, and is looking forward to talking more college classes or attend a trade school. The first time you meet him you will see a soft spoken and kind hearted young man that gets along great with others. Please pray that Zach is granted clemency.Cassandra BarkerPosted at 20:11h, 22 MayReplyAnthony Allen has been incarcerated foralmost 29 yrs .

The state dismissedChristopher NeelyPosted at 18:44h, 26 MayReplyTo Gov.Pritzker.I am Christopher reaching out to you about my nephew Ronald. On behalf of Ronald whom is and has been incarcerated for over 10 years and has done a dramatic 360 during this time. Being my nephew Governor Pritzker i’ve noticed and has personally seen these dramatic changes he’s gone thru and completed. Achieving his G.E.D diploma was the first major step which it didn’t stop there. He went on to receive other degrees and certificates. Due to tragedies which happened in his life especially loosing his mother it wasn’t going to stop him from moving forward and taking the necessary steps to walk a fine line. I know his mom would truely be proud.. Due to the Coronavirus which has had a tremendous effect on all of our lives and family members. We worry deeply about Ronald because of his daily living conditions in these prisons. Especially his health. No one is exempt. I do understand but due to what i’ve seen my nephew has been thru and what he has achieved today i’m asking you Gov.Pritzker to take into consideration and take a look at sending him home to his loved one’s whom is waiting with open arms. He has a job prepared and waiting for him. A loving home with all types of family and friends support. Family and friends are willing to support with whatever he needs to help him to be that productive member of society. There is no limit what i’m willing to do. Church and it’s member also. Please take time to consider this letter Gov.Pritzker. I know your a busy man. Thanks for the good job your doing.Sincerely yours, ChristopherCarrie NeelyPosted at 19:53h, 26 MayReplyDear Gov.Pritzker, I’m writing to you today on the behalf of my grandson Ronald whom has been incarcerated for over 10 years. I don’t get a chance to visit him due to my health. Now that Covid19 which has caught us all by surprise it’s really,difficult,scary and frightening because of unknown everyday deaths especially family due to this virus. I would Love to hug,kiss and see face to face my Grandson rather than not to be viewed in a box nor vice-versa seeing him. I don’t want to view another family member especially seeing him that way. Due to the conditionss that surrounds the penal systems this virus has no limits to the lives it touches and takes. My Grandson was a teen when the crime was committed and was tremendously misled and mistreated. We lost his Mom a few years later my daughter and he still managed to put one foot in front of the other and achieved his GED diploma and began to receive other certificates. I am truely proud him especially when it comes to mind over matter situations. He’s learned to rise above and excel. A whole complete life change. I Love and enjoy his phone conversations. Very educational and Love. I Love the walk he’s walking. He has planned and continues to plan his future and goals has been set but due to this coronavirus the odds are really against us all. He has a stable job awaiting him. Beautiful home with full family,church and close friends support. Alot has been achieved by my grandson Ronald already. A strong minded man. Gov.Pritzker please help me to help him achieve the rest.Sincerely Grandmother Carrie NeelyKenisha SmithPosted at 11:26h, 30 MayReplyHey gov Pritzker I’m writing on behalf of Dareonte he has been incarcerated for a year now with 5months to go if not longer he has 3 little sister & 1 little brother we just lost his first cousin to Covar 19 last month so it’s really been hard on the family he’s the extra help around the house his mom work 1 of his little sister is sick need help gettin around & mom now has to put more work into home she just Recovered from a mental breakdown she lost her mother not too long ago so things have been kind of tough and also she losing hours & she’s the only 1 with income so bills & medical bills are backing up all cause this big piece of the puzzle is not around to help out with his siblings DareonteAlways played a big part in his siblings life he was his sister care taker Dareonte is & has been in GED Program he trying to show improvements With the Cove or 19 It is a big threat to his sisters health conditions so it’s hard to say who can be around her doing this pandemic Dareonte commits to attending and finishing his GED program if he is granted the ability to release early he will also be attending college courses once he’s done his family will be greatly appreciated to have him back home safe and sound Thank you we are going to pray for a good outcome in this situationEcho HamptonPosted at 18:34h, 30 MayReplyTo Gov.

He is in jail for aggravated battery after getting into a fight with U of I college Caucasian student , after my cousin who is African American defended himself he was arrested and charged . He was on parole already so the PRB chose to violate him . We have gotten him a lawyer but this lawyer has been no help in which I am filing a complaint against also for discrimination also . He is very rude and has cursed as me and my family when we called to get updates . We recently bonded my cousin out after hearing they were letting inmates for lesser chargesin spite of Covid and also he has asthma . The PRB lied and said they reviewed his case for release and never sent him paperwork or his parole officer . They are now saying they refused to let him out , did not send him any paper work saying yes or no and basically have him sitting in Champaign county until IDOC opens to finish his sentence which he has less then a 1 year . Please look in matter and contact me as thismatter it is being untreated unfair . Several other men , ( Caucasian) have been giving house arrest and have went home to there families . My cousin is a good kid like all who made a decision after being provoked by a drunken student and is now in Champaign county jail sitting since according to the jail can’t be released until IDOC comes to pick him up . He has a home to go to right now , please release him . Or look into this matter . PleaseCharniece LusterPosted at 03:39h, 26 JuneReplyAttention Governor Pritzker,I am reaching out to you on behalf of Ronald. Ronald has been in prison for over 10 years, which is a harsh reality given the fact that he was only 15 when sentenced. He paid his dues. We have good faith that Ronald will be another success story for life after prison. He has earned his G.E.D and other educational tools while incarcerated. He has an excellent support system and access to other resources for returning citizens upon being released. Ronald plans to continued to give back to his community. Another harsh reality is the corona virus pandemic, in which is making the prison conditions horrific. This is increasing our concerns for Ronald. We ask that you please consider his early release. This will give him a promising future. Thank you for your time and consideration.Kyvaonna FieldsPosted at 23:07h, 26 JuneReplyAttention Governor Pritzker: I’m writing this letter in regards of my boyfriend Terrace He is currently locked up in thecorrectional center and he has less then 10 months left I feel like he deserves another chance to come home and turn his life around I pray that you give him that chance thank you and have a blessed dayPost A Comment Cancel ReplyΔMailing Address: Restore Justice FoundationPO Box 101099Chicago, IL 60610Follow UsSubscribe:First NameLast NameEmail address:Street AddressCityStateZIPCountryCountryAfghanistanAland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Saint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBritish Virgin IslandsBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCook IslandsCosta RicaCroatiaCubaCuracaoCyprusCzech RepublicDemocratic Republic of the CongoDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEast TimorEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyIvory CoastJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKosovoKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian TerritoryPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRepublic of the CongoReunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthelemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluU.S. Virgin IslandsUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVaticanVenezuelaVietnamWallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabweLeave this field empty if you're human:Δ© 2020 Restore Justice & Restore Justice Illinois.
