The U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) is seeking 5,000 new beds to house the unprecedented numbers of immigrants who are in its custody. “The DHS’s decision to partner with private prisons sends a horrible message about profiteering at the expense of individuals seeking asylum,” said Brickner.DHS’s decision to negotiate deals with private prisons is especially troubling as just two months ago the Department of Justice announced the end of its use of private prisons after finding evidence of widespread abuse. Following suit, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson asked the Homeland Security Advisory Council to review its current policy on the use of private immigration detention centers and evaluate whether to eliminate the practice. Prior to DOJ’s announcement this year, the federal Bureau of Prisons had cancelled its contract with CCA in Youngstown in December 2014.“During ICE detention, these people have been subject to abuse and mistreatment,” said Brickner. “Incentivizing private companies to detain people for profit only exacerbates our criminal justice system problems. To allow more people to be incarcerated for a profit in Ohio sends our state in the wrong direction.” We urge local legislators to immediately call for an end to the contract discussions between ICE and CCA and prevent the Youngstown prison from becoming an ICE detention center.###Take Action! » End the use of for-profit detention centers.Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesImmigrant RightsRelated contentACLU of Ohio Issues Statement on HJR 4 and SJR 6May 18, 2022The Executive Order Loophole: Private Prisons and ICEOctober 7, 2021Here’s How You Can Celebrate The AAPI Community All Year LongJune 8, 2021ACLU of Ohio Calls on Biden Administration and Local Sheriffs to...May 27, 2021Ohio Counties Need to Cut Ties with ICEMarch 16, 2021Amaya-Cruz, et al. v.
