The court did not throw out the law’s hotly debated “show me your papers” provision, but their decision expressly opens the door for more legal challenges, including those brought forth by the ACLU.“This decision clearly shows that the federal government is responsible for creating and enforcing immigration policy, not the state of Arizona,” said ACLU of Ohio Executive Director Christine Link. “The court’s ruling bolsters our arguments and serves as a prelude to the work we will do to ensure that no one is unconstitutionally targeted because of their race or ethnicity — in Arizona, Ohio or anywhere else.”Today’s high court decision reinforced federal control of immigration law by striking down SB 1070’s requirement that all immigrants obtain or carry registration papers. It also struck a provision that would allow for the warrantless arrest of undocumented immigrants and another that would criminalize employment for all undocumented workers.The court did not strike down the law’s controversial” show me your papers” provision, which requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they believe to be in the U.S. illegally. However, the high court made clear that this decision will not affect any legal challenges that argue against the law on different grounds. These challenges were delayed, pending the outcome of this case, but they can now move forward.“The court did not strike down “show me your papers” but they certainly didn’t endorse it,” said Link. “Today the court dealt with the federal government’s complaints about the Arizona law. Our argument that “show me your papers” provisions invite unconstitutional racial profiling will be decided another day.”Stay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesImmigrant RightsRelated contentACLU of Ohio Issues Statement on HJR 4 and SJR 6May 18, 2022The Executive Order Loophole: Private Prisons and ICEOctober 7, 2021Here’s How You Can Celebrate The AAPI Community All Year LongJune 8, 2021ACLU of Ohio Calls on Biden Administration and Local Sheriffs to...May 27, 2021Ohio Counties Need to Cut Ties with ICEMarch 16, 2021Amaya-Cruz, et al. v.
