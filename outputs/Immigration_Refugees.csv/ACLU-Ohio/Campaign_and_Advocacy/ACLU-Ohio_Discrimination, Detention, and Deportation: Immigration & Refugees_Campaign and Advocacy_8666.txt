This bill includes tasking jails with checking the immigration status of anyone arrested before being released.Jurisdiction/Legislation LevelStateLCS Legislation Statushttp://lsc.state.oh.us/coderev/hou129.nsf/House+Bill+Number/0580?OpenDoc...Our Take on This BillThe ACLU of Ohio strongly opposes HB 580, Ohio’s immigration enforcement bill modeled after Arizona’s SB 1070. HB 580 expands the role of Ohio law enforcement officials to play double duty as both police and immigration officers, despite the various documented complications and civil liberties complaints about detention and profiling from around the country from similar measures. HB 580, especially with its problematic language mandating an immigration status determination before release after an arrest, brings these same civil liberties concerns to Ohio.CommitteesTransportation / Public Safety / Homeland Security (H)SponsorsRep.
