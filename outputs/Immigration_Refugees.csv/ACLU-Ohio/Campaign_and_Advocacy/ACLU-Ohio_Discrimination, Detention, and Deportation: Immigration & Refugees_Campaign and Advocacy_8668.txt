Currently, granting driver’s licenses and permits to those eligible under DACA is inconsistent, leaving eligible applicants unequally protected and without answers for why they were rejected. SB 62 seeks to ensure that eligible applicants are able to get driver’s licenses and permits no matter where they live in Ohio, so they may continue going to school, working, and contributing to our communities.CommitteesState Government Oversight and Reform (S)SponsorsSen.
