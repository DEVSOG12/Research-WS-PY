In addition, it stipulates that undocumented workers who suffer any injury as a result of the job cannot file a lawsuit against an employer unless the worker has “clear and convincing” evidence that they were unlawfully hired.Jurisdiction/Legislation LevelStateLCS Legislation Statushttps://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-status?id=GA132...Our Take on This BillThe ACLU of Ohio opposes HB 380 because it would cause great harm to an already vulnerable population. A person who is seriously injured, diseased, or dying because of their hard work should not have additional hurdles put in their way if they wish to hold a neglectful or exploitative business or corporation accountable for their actions.This bill gives license to corrupt businesses to hire undocumented workers and assign them to work the most harmful jobs or in the most dangerous environments, since many of the working people this bill targets do not have the resources to file lawsuits or conduct a search for “clear and convincing” evidence against their employers.Bill StatusIntroduced in the House on 10/11/17SponsorsRep.
