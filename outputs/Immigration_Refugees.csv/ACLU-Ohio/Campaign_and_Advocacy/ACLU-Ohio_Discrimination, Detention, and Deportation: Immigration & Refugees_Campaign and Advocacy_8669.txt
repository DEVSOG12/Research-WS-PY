DACA grantees are legally authorized to be in the United States by the federal government, and both the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Ohio Attorney General have established that DACA grantees are eligible for driver’s licenses. HB 114 effectively circumvents this, arbitrarily barring many Ohio residents from a driver’s license.CommitteesTransportation / Public Safety / Homeland Security (H)SponsorsRep. Becker (R), Rep.
