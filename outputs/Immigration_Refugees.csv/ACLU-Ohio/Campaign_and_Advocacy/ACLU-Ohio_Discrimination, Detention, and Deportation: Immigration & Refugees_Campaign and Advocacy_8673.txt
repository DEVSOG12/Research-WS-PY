This bill would extend this list to include immigration-related executive orders.The bill also gives more discretion to the director of public safety as to when a municipality is not compliant with the aforementioned laws.Jurisdiction/Legislation LevelStateLCS Legislation Statushttps://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-status?id=GA132...Our Take on This BillThe ACLU of Ohio opposes this bill because bullying municipalities through the threat of withholding funds is fundamentally wrong. This bill would force municipalities to compel local law enforcement to assist federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by way of threatening to withhold vital funding.Withholding funds to enforce immigration orders adds nothing to safety and only increases tensions between local police officers and the communities they are supposed to protect and serve.As the director of public safety would be able to determine noncompliance without any metric, their discretion would be wide and easily abused. The current law has a series of means through which a municipality could be determined to be noncompliant; eliminating this list leaves the fate of municipalities in the hands of one person with no means of checking that person.Bill StatusIntroduced in the Senate on 6/13/15Referred to the Senate Finance Committee on 6/15/17CommitteesFinance (S)AuthorsSen.
