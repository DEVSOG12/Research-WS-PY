Policy 413 says the opposite.So what has changed?  Has Painesville seen increases in gang activity or violent crimes in immigrant communities? Public statements by Chief Powalie indicate no such trend.Appendix D of a study titled “The Role of Local Police: Striking a Balance Between Immigration Enforcement & Civil Liberties,” released in 2009 by The Police Foundation states that crime rates historically decrease significantly during times immigration rates are highest.If immigrant neighborhoods in Painesville have lower rates of violent crime, why would Painesville Police need a policy targeting them?It seems more than a coincidence that the Painesville policy is being implemented while President Trump is attempting to force cities to act as agents for ICE. Many cities have refused because they feel this would be a violation of civil liberties and enforcing federal immigration law is the job of federal agents.“As police agencies move away from their core role of ensuring public safety,” the study says, “and begin taking on civil immigration enforcement activities, the perception immigrants have of the role of police moves from protection to arrest and deportation, thereby jeopardizing local law enforcement’s ability to gain the trust and cooperation of immigrant communities.”Determining reasonable suspicion, as outlined in Policy 413, is too subjective. It also has no policies or procedures for monitoring racial profiling or abuse of authority, as recommended in the study. Because it does not require conviction, it could easily result in non-violent parents being separated from their children.It is not Chief Powalie’s fault that Congress has failed to address our broken immigration laws, but there is little to be gained from Policy 413 and it should be rescinded.Brian Rice and Carole Maldonado are community activistsStay informedEmail address *Zip code *Leave this field blankJoin our Action TeamStand with usRelated IssuesImmigrant RightsPolice PracticesRelated contentCincinnati Public Schools and PoliceJuly 26, 2022New Data Shows Over-Policing, Racial Disparities, and Lack of...July 13, 2022Policing in Cincinnati Public Schools: Community Survey ResultsJuly 13, 2022Disparate Racial Discipline In Cincinnati Public SchoolsJuly 13, 2022ACLU of Ohio Issues Statement on HJR 4 and SJR 6May 18, 2022The Executive Order Loophole: Private Prisons and ICEOctober 7, 2021FAQ: Power of Mayors - ClevelandAugust 3, 2021FAQ: Power of Mayors - CincinnatiAugust 3, 2021Ending the School-To-Prison Pipeline: A Case Study of Cincinnati...June 24, 2021Search acluohio.orgPress ReleasesRequest AssistanceDonateJoinACLU on FacebookACLU on TwitterACLU on Instagram© 2022 ACLU of Ohio4506 Chester Ave. | Cleveland, OH 441031108 City Park Ave., Suite 203 | Columbus, OH 43206contact@acluohio.orgUser AgreementPrivacy StatementWebsite Accessibility
