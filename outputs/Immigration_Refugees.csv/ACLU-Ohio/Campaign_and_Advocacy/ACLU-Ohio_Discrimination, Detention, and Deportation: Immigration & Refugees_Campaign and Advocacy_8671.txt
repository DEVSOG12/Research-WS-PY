Under DACA status, children who were brought to the U.S before the age of 16 by their undocumented immigrant parents are approved for work permits and will not be deported for at least 2 years.Jurisdiction/Legislation LevelStateLCS Legislation Statushttp://lsc.state.oh.us/coderev/hou130.nsf/House+Bill+Number/0254?OpenDoc...Our Take on This BillThe ACLU of Ohio supports the ability of immigrants in Ohio, many of whom have lived here almost all their lives, to get a more affordable higher education degree. HB 254 unfairly punishes children for the actions of their parents and ignores the fact that these students have been authorized by the federal Department of Homeland Security to be legally present in the United States.  The ACLU of Ohio opposes this bill and urges the legislature to allow these children and young adults to contribute to this state and country by earning a college degree.CommitteesEducation (H)SponsorsRep.
