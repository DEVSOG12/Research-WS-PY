Once an individual is verified to be an undocumented immigrant, the bill authorizes notifying employers and other government entities, license removal, and ineligibility for state benefits for them and their families.Jurisdiction/Legislation LevelStateLCS Legislation Statushttp://lsc.state.oh.us/coderev/hou129.nsf/House+Bill+Number/0252?OpenDoc...Our Take on This BillHB 252 is an unnecessary and excessive expansion of law that has prosecuting attorneys take on the additional role of immigration enforcement. Despite the complexities of immigration law, this bill tasks prosecutors with tracking down citizenship and immigration status, as well as initiating a process that jeopardizes employment, driver’s licenses, and government benefits. Although undocumented immigrants are already ineligible for almost all state and federal government benefits, this bill also strips eligibility from their families for some programs, no matter their citizenship status.CommitteesTransportation / Public Safety / Homeland Security (H)SponsorsRep.
