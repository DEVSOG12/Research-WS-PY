It also mandates parole eligibility for kids who were sentenced before the age of 18. Ohio would become the 23rd state in the country to ban juvenile life without parole sentences if the bill is adopted. Please contact the House Criminal Justice Committee and urge them to pass SB 256. Tell representatives that no child is irredeemable and we want a policy that values redemption and hope.Chairman George Lang614-466-8550@LangForOhioVice-Chair Phil Plummer614-644-8051@PhilPlummerOH40Ranking Member David Leland614-466-2473@RepDavidLelandRep.

Thomas West614-466-8030@RepThomasWestSubstitute Senate Bill 3—Drug SentencingSub SB 3 is monumentally important because it will change low-level drug possession cases from felonies into unclassified misdemeanors. This bill will remove at least 387 barriers to work and livelihood in Ohio. The House Criminal Justice Committee needs to hear from as many people as possible with a simple message: people struggling with addiction need treatment not prison. Contact the committee and tell them you support passing SB 3 because it changes felonies into misdemeanors!Chairman George Lang614-466-8550@LangForOhioVice-Chair Phil Plummer614-644-8051@PhilPlummerOH40Ranking Member David Leland614-466-2473@RepDavidLelandRep.

Thomas West614-466-8030@RepThomasWestHB 1—Intervention in lieu of conviction/expanded record sealingHB 1 will allow more people to enter into diversion programs for drug and alcohol abuse in lieu of a criminal conviction, and it will make it easier for people to seal past criminal convictions, and in turn expanding opportunities for people with criminal records. HB 1 passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Dec. 9. Now, it just needs the Senate President to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Please call, email or tweet at Senate President Obhof and urge him to bring the bill for a vote.Sen. Larry ObhofSenate President614-466-7505obhof@ohiosenate.gov@LarryObhofHouse Bill 136—Death Penalty exemption for serious mental illnessesHB 136 ends the practice of sending individuals with severe mental illness to death row. The bill limits who can be sentenced to death by excluding people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and delusional disorder from death sentences. It was amended then passed by the full Senate on Dec. 9 by a vote of 27-3. The House already passed its version in June 2019, and all the House needs to do is agree to the two Senate amendments to the bill. Please call Speaker Bob Cupp and urge him to allow the House to vote to accept Senate changes. When this bill passes, Ohio will become the first state in the nation to protect individuals with severe mental illness from the death penalty.Speaker Bob Cupp614-466-9624@SpeakerCuppHouse Bill 263—Professional licensingHB 263 will be up for a hearing next week in the Senate Transportation, Commerce and Workforce Development Committee. will help people with criminal records get access to the initial professional licenses they need in their field of work. Collateral sanctions restrict access to employment opportunities to anyone with a past criminal conviction, no matter how long ago or unrelated the charge. This bill limits licensure denials and the disqualification time since the conviction to five years. Contact the Senate President, Chairman and members of the committee by phone (or tweet at them) and urge them to support and pass the bill. Please encourage them to act quickly before lame duck ends!Senate Transportation, Commerce and Workforce CommitteeChairman Rob McColley614-466-8150@Rob_McColleyVice-Chairman Terry Johnson 614-466-8082@DrTerryAJohnsonRanking Member Nickie Antonio614-466-5123@nickieantonioSen.
