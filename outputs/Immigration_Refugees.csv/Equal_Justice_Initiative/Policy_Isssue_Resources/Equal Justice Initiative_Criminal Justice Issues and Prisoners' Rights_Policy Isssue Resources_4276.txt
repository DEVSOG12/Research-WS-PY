The section then reviews all complaints to determine whether the allegations merit a more extensive investigation.The assistant attorney general decides whether the evidence warrants a full investigation. If the decision is made to investigate, the State is given at least one week’s notice, after which, the Justice Department contacts State officials to arrange for a tour of the facility and may ask officials to produce documents relevant to the case.The attorney general’s office has notified the Alabama Department of Corrections and begun touring Tutwiler prison and interviewing witnesses to civil rights violations there. If a pattern of violations is uncovered, the assistant attorney general will send a “findings letter” that states the alleged violations, explains evidence that was found to support the findings, and defines the minimum steps required to correct the violations.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesWetumpka HeraldPrison Conditions Are Still TroublingMontgomery AdvertiserdocumentJustice Investigates Sexual Abuse at TutwilerWSFA NewsU.S. Dept. of Justice Investigating Conditions at Tutwiler Women's PrisonAL.comU.S. Justice Department Investigating Conditions at Tutwiler PrisonAL.comGov.
