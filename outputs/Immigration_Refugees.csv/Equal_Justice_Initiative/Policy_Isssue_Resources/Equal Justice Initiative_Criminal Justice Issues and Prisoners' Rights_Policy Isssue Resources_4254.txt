Death row inmates are kept alone in their cells twenty-four hours a day, with ten-minute showers three times a week and an hour of exercise five days a week in outdoor cells not much bigger than their indoor cells. Mr. Prieto “is left alone in a small cell nearly every hour of every day,” the court wrote. Isolation creates a significant hardship for prisoners, which is exacerbated by the extended amount of time they may spend on death row.The court struck down the automatic policy of isolating death-sentenced inmates but ruled that they may be held in solitary confinement if there is a particular need.At a hearing last week, the court said the requirements its ruling imposes on Virginia put it in line with the policies used in most other states in the Fourth Circuit. The American Civil Liberties Union told the Associated Press that the ruling is the first of its kind nationally.Tags:Death PenaltyPrison ConditionsSolitary ConfinementRelated ResourcesAssociated PressJudge Rules Death Row Procedures UnconstitutionalRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
