It also bans flat-rate calling, whereby providers charge a flat rate for a call up to 15 minutes regardless of actual call duration.The FCC also cut its existing cap on interstate long-distance calls by up to 50 percent and barred or strictly limited the add-on fees and charges imposed by prison phone service providers, which the FCC said can increase the cost of families staying in touch by phone with loved ones who are incarcerated by as much as 40 percent.The new rules affect inmates in federal and state prisons, as well as immigration detention centers. They also apply to local jails, though the rate caps are higher in smaller facilities.Millions of incarcerated Americans and their loved ones will now see an end to exorbitant phone fees that have long been imposed by companies with monopolies on connecting people in prison to the outside world.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPovertyPrison ConditionsRe-EntryRelated ResourcesNBC News'Huge Step': FCC Slashes Costs of Prison Phone CallsFCCFCC Takes Next Big Steps in Reducing Inmate Calling RatesRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
