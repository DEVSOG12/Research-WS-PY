He was serving an 18-month split sentence for identity theft and property convictions. He was scheduled to be released on May 5, which was his 24th birthday.This week EJI also received reports that a man who died on February 9 was the victim of a homicide and was strangled to death. He was serving a 30-year sentence for theft and burglary convictions and was scheduled to complete his sentence on April 20.Tuesday’s homicide is the 56th Alabama prison homicide that EJI has documented since the U.S. Department of Justice began its investigation into the state’s prisons in October 2016. Both the number and rate of prison homicides has climbed markedly since the investigation began.EJI has documented 27 homicides in Alabama prisons since the Justice Department released its findings on April 2, 2019, that Alabama “routinely violates the constitutional rights of prisoners” by failing to protect them from rampant violence and sexual abuse.The Justice Department found “a high level of violence that is too common, cruel, of an unusual nature, and pervasive.”Though the recent high rate of homicides ranks Alabama prisons among the most deadly in the country, there is evidence that the Alabama Department of Corrections undercounts the true rate of violence as it does not report prisoner deaths that are the result of officer force and has repeatedly classified homicides as deaths due to “natural” causes.Tags:AlabamaPrison ConditionsRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
