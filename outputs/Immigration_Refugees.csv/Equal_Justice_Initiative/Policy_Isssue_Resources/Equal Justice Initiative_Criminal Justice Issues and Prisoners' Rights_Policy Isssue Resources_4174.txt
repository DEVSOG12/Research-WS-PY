News of the escape was broadcast widely by local and national media, including AL.com, WBRC, and the Associated Press. At 7:51 am, ADOC announced that Mr. Murphy had been recaptured.The corrections department later acknowledged that this entire story was false—and that Mr. Murphy had made no attempt to escape.AP, AL.com, and other news outlets updated their coverage to reflect that Mr. Murphy had never left the prison and repeated ADOC’s claim that the alert was issued in compliance with protocol and “out of an abundance of caution.” But media have not reported on how ADOC was unable to locate Mr. Murphy in the prison for nearly eight hours even though he was not hiding.The failures in oversight implicated in Mr. Murphy’s reported escape point to the perilous state of Alabama’s prisons. The closure of Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama, and reassignment of its population has intensified these management problems.In early March, after ADOC announced that it was decommissioning Holman and transferring all incarcerated men not under a death sentence to other facilities, Steve Murphy and other men were transferred from Holman to St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Alabama.Related CaseSt. Clair Correctional FacilityEJI filed a class action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of men incarcerated at St. Clair in Springville, Alabama.St. Clair has experienced three escapes since December 2017. Two of the men escaped using firearms. Six men were stabbed to death last year, broken door locks are a chronic problem, and hundreds of knives have been found in the prison.ADOC officials are defending multiple lawsuits alleging that years of poor management, a culture of violence, and indifference to basic security lapses like broken locks have created dangerous conditions for staff, incarcerated people, and the public and have led to an extraordinarily high rate of violence.Tags:AlabamaPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesAs Prison Spending Increases, So Does Violence and MisconductEJIWhat You Need to Know About the Alabama Prison CrisisEJIRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
