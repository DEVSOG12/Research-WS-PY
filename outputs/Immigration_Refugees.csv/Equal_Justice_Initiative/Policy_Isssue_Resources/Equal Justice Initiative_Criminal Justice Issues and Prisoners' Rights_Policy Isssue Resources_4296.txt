EJI supported the project and the film, which is now being screened across the country.The film has received glowing reviews and critical acclaim. Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis said: “This film makes it plain that no human being–no matter how troubled his beginning, regardless of his race, color, nationality, or creed–should be considered beyond the reach of redemption.” The New York Times calls the film “an emotional documentary about the benefits of meditation for a most unlikely set of candidates.”The Dhamma Brothers will be screened at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, Alabama, on Sunday, September 28, 2008.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesNPRAt End-of-the-Line Prison, An Unlikely EscapeRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
