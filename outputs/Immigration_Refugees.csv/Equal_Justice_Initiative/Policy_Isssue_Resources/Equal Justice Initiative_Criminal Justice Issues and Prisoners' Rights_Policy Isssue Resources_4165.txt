Charles Braggs, a 28-year-old Black man serving a 20 year sentence for robbery convictions that occurred when he was 17, was reportedly found dead in his segregation cell on July 27.Mr. Braggs was being held in the prison’s segregation unit, where complaints about intolerably high temperatures and unsanitary conditions have escalated in recent weeks. Several men incarcerated at St. Clair have reported that they are being denied showers and that reduced staff and faulty locks make the segregation unit especially dangerous. Reports indicate that Mr. Braggs had been held in segregation for more than a year.Mr. Braggs reportedly was found dead in his cell by segregation supervisor Sergeant Derrick Dent, who witnesses say was involved in an altercation with Mr. Braggs in the segregation unit three days before Mr. Braggs was found dead in his cell. Witnesses reported that Dent sprayed Mr. Braggs with chemical spray during a use of force incident the week before his death.Related ResourceAlabama's 13 State Prisons Are Grotesque Chambers of HorrorsThe Washington Post's editorial board writes that Alabama may have "the nation%u2019s most mismanaged, inhumane and blood-soaked prison system."EJI has received numerous reports about Dent’s use of excessive force.
