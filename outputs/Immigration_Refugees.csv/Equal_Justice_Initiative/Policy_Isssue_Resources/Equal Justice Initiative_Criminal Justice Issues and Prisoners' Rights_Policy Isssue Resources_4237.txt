coerced prisoners to engage in oral sex; engaged in voyeurism, watching women while they shower and use the toilet; and subject women to a “daily barrage of sexually explicit verbal abuse.”The United States Attorney General said the state could avoid a federal lawsuit if it implemented certain reforms by March 7, 2014.On May 28, 2015, the Justice Department filed a federal lawsuit against the Alabama Department of Corrections, alleging that the Alabama authorities “have allowed a sexualized environment to exist at Tutwiler, such that sexual abuse and sexual harassment are constant, and prisoners must sometimes submit to unlawful sexual advances from staff in order to obtain necessities or to avoid punishment.”Federal prosecutors agreed to a settlement that requires that sexual abuse and harassment allegations are properly and thoroughly reported, requires that women are protected from retaliation when reporting abuse, and provides for a rigorous tracking system for prison staff, who will presumptively face firing (rather than transfer) for committing sexual abuse.State officials also agreed to install monitoring cameras and increase privacy in bathrooms, and to hire a full-time compliance manager for the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act.Policy changes must be implemented within nine months, and the agreement requires an independent monitor to provide compliance reports to the court every six months.“Prisoners are entitled to be safe from sexual predation by staff, and to live in an environment free from sexual assault, sexual harassment and the constant fear of these abuses,” said the head of the Civil Rights Division, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta.“Our agreement uses gender-responsive and trauma-informed principles designed to address and eliminate the culture of abuse that Tutwiler’s women prisoners have suffered from and endured for years.”EJI investigators have observed improved conditions at Tutwiler, but it has taken too long to implement meaningful reforms, and a lot more work remains to be done.Recognizing that, for more than a decade, existing practices at Tutwiler led to an environment that was abusive to both staff (resulting in severe under-staffing) and inmates, the agreement is a comprehensive strategy document that requires a massive overhaul of the culture, policies, and operations at Tutwiler.The agreement does not end the Department of Corrections’s relationship with the Justice Department, but formalizes it by mandating that Alabama corrections officials work transparently with federal prosecutors to implement new policies and monitor successful compliance.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesMontgomery AdvertiserCorrections, DOJ Reach Tutwiler Prison AgreementAL.comAlabama Reaches Agreement with Department of Justice on Julia Tutwiler ReformsAssociated PressAlabama, Feds Reach Agreement Over Alleged Prison AbuseJustice Department Press ReleaseRecent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
