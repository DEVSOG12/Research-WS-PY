EJI has asked the Department of Justice to investigate that matter and they have agreed to do so.Thomas said no “investigation” is needed but told lawmakers he had requested technical assistance from the National Institute of Corrections to tour the facility, talk with staff and inmates, review internal policies, and make recommendations of steps that can be taken to reduce inappropriate staff conduct with female inmates.Thomas said he also asked two of his staff, who are responsible for making sure the Department of Corrections is in compliance with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, to look at how investigations are conducted when abuse is reported.State Senator Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, vice chairman of the joint legislative prison committee, said he would like the report to be available to committee members during the next meeting and committed to continuing to monitor the situation.EJI director Bryan Stevenson said he appreciated the commissioner’s words but said the department needs to get “past good intentions to meaningful solutions.”“There are specific protocol responses and actions that we believe can lower the incidence of sexual violence at the women’s prison and we hope that the department will consider implementing them,” Stevenson said.Tags:Mass IncarcerationPrison ConditionsRelated ResourcesBirmingham NewsAlabama Prisons Chief Orders Review After Complaint About Tutwiler Sex Assaults, 6/20/12Recent NewsMore newsEJI’s Community Remembrance Project Installs Historical Marker in Frankfort10.26.22EJI Releases New Report on the Transatlantic Slave Trade10.25.22Daniel Smith, Believed to Be the Last Child of Enslaved People, Dies at 9010.21.22Homicide at Limestone Is 16th in Alabama Prisons This Year10.18.22More newsFollow EJIfacebooktwitterinstagramyoutubeHomeMuseum and MemorialNewsAboutContactGet InvolvedDonateShop122 Commerce Street Montgomery, AL 36104(334) 269-1803[email protected]Subscribe to our newsletter© Equal Justice Initiative 2022
