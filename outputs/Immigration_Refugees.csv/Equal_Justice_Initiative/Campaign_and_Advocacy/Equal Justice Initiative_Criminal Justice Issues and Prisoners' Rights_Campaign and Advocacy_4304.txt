QUESTIONS PRESENTED  
 
1. Does imposition of a life-without-parole sentence 
on a 14-year-old child convicted of homicide vio-late the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments’ 
prohibition against cruel and unusual punish-
ments? 
2.  Does such a sentence violate the Eighth and 
Fourteenth Amendments when it is imposed upon this 14-year-old petitioner, who did not per-
sonally kill the homicide victim, did not person-
ally engage in any act of  physical violence toward 
the victim, and was not shown even to have an-
ticipated, let alone intended, that anyone be 
killed?  
3. Does such a sentence violate the Eighth and 
Fourteenth Amendments when it is imposed up-on a 14-year-old child as a result of a mandatory 
sentencing scheme that categorically precludes 
consideration of the offender’s young age or any other mitigating circumstances?

Ways That Bear Directly on the Ques-
tion of Culpability Central to Eighth

 C.   Hundreds of State and Federal Laws

1.   State and Federal Law Recognizes 
That Young Adolescents Are Especially Vulnerable and Provides Heightened 
Protection from Exploitation and 
Abuse .....................................................  30 
2.   State and Federal Law Recognizes

Young Adolescents Because the Retrib-
utive, Deterrent, an d Incapacitative 
Virtues of Such a Punishment Are At-

Life-Without-Parole Sentence on a 
Young Teenager Is an Aberrant, Ex-ceedingly Rare Occurrence ....................  47

Eighth Amendment Excessiveness Analy-
sis ..................................................................  52

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 Kuntrell Jackson was sentenced to life impris-
onment without parole for felony murder occurring during a robbery incident on November 18, 1999, less 
than three weeks after his 14th birthday. The State’s 
evidence showed that K untrell and two older boys, 
Derrick Shields and Travis Booker (Kuntrell’s cousin), 
were walking through a housing project when they 
began discussing the idea of robbing a local video store. Jackson v. State , 194 S.W.3d 757, 758 (Ark. 
2004). Kuntrell then became aware that Shields was 
carrying a shotgun in his coat sleeve. Id. At the store, 
the two older boys entered;  Kuntrell chose to stay 
outside. Id. Inside, Shields pointed his gun at a clerk 
and demanded money six or seven times. Id. at 758-
59. The clerk refused. Id. at 759. During this ex-
change, Kuntrell entered the store. Id. When the 
clerk threatened to call th e police, Shields shot and 
killed her. Id. The boys ran from the store. Id. They 
did not take any money. Id. 
 The prosecutor exercised his discretion under 
Arkansas Code § 9-27-318(c) to charge Kuntrell as an 
adult with one count of capital felony murder (Ark. Code Ann. § 5-10-101) and one count of aggravated 
robbery (Ark. Code Ann. § 5-12-103). J.A. 42-43. Fol-
lowing the trial court’s refusal to transfer the case to juvenile court, Jackson v. State , No. CA 02-535, 2003 
WL 193412 (Ark. Ct. App.  Jan. 29, 2003), Kuntrell 
was convicted of capital felony murder and aggra- vated robbery on July 19, 2003. J.A. 53-54. The 
judge, legally barred from considering Kuntrell’s 3 
age, character, individual circumstances, or degree of 
involvement in the offense, imposed a mandatory 
sentence of life without parole on the capital-murder 
conviction. J.A. 54-57. The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed without reviewing the propriety of the sen-
tence. Jackson , 194 S.W.3d at 762. 
 On January 8, 2008, following this Court’s de-
cision in Roper v. Simmons , 543 U.S. 551 (2005), 
Kuntrell filed a petition for habeas corpus under Arkansas Code § 16-112-101 et seq., in the Jefferson 
County Circuit Court. Kunt rell’s petition asserted 
that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments pro-hibit a mandatory sentence of  life without parole for a 
14-year-old child who was not the trigger person and 
who did not intend to kill. The State filed a motion to 
dismiss. After a non-evidentiary hearing, the circuit 
court granted the State’s motion on September 17, 
2008. J.A. 72-76. 
 Kuntrell appealed to the Arkansas Supreme 
Court. While his appeal was pending, this Court de-cided Graham v. Florida , 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010), hold-
ing that juveniles cannot be sentenced to life with- 
out parole for nonhomicid e offenses. Kuntrell was 
granted leave to file a supplemental brief regarding 
Graham . It made three arguments. First, Graham  
confirms Kuntrell’s basic su bmission that juveniles 
can assert categorical challenges to life-without-
parole sentences under the Eighth and Fourteenth 
Amendments. Second, Graham ’s recognition that a 
young person’s age must constitutionally be con-
sidered at sentencing prohibits mandatory sentences 4 
of life without parole for juveniles. Third, because 
Kuntrell did not commit the shooting and did not 
intend the victim’s death, Graham  invalidates his 
life-without-parole sentence. 
 The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed Kuntrell’s 
sentence on February 9, 2011. J.A. 77-82. Address- ing the merits of Kuntrell’s Eighth and Fourteenth 
Amendment claims, the Arkansas Supreme Court 
concluded that “[t]he [United States Supreme] Court’s holdings in Roper  and Graham  are very narrowly 
tailored to death-penalty cases involving a juvenile 
and life-imprisonment-without-parole cases for non-homicide offenses involving a juvenile.” J.A. 81. A 
four-justice majority therefore “decline[d] to extend 
the Court’s bans to homici de cases involving a juve-
nile where the death penalty is not at issue.” J.A. 81-
82. Two justices dissented from the court’s judgment. 
J.A. 84-89. They concluded that Graham  rendered 
Kuntrell’s sentence unconstitutional because the 
state failed to prove that he had any intent to kill. 
J.A. 87-88. The dissenters emphasized that Kuntrell’s role in the offense was “no more, if not less than, 
Graham’s involvement had been .” J.A. 88. They noted 
that Kuntrell’s mandatory sentence did not take account of his young age or other mitigating cir-
cumstances, as Graham  requires. J.A. 88. A third 
justice wrote a separate conc urrence to note that he 
“agree[d] with [Kuntrell’s] argument that this state 
needs a procedural mechani sm for the jury to hear 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances before a juvenile is put away in prison for the rest of his life 5 
without the possibility of par ole.” J.A. 83. Such indi-
vidualized consideration in Kuntrell’s case “may well 
have convinced the jury that life without parole was 
too severe and not appropriate in light of [Kuntrell’s] age and circumstances.” J.A. 83.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
 Graham v. Florida , 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010), and 
Roper v. Simmons , 543 U.S. 551 (2005), identified 
numerous features of adoles cence that make teen 
offenders less culpable than adults: Biologically and 
psychologically, teens are given to impulsive, heed-
less, sensation-seeking behavior and excessive peer pressure. Through inexperience and neurological un-
derdevelopment, they lack mature behavioral con-
trols. They are shaped by environments they did not 
choose and cannot change or escape. Their youthful 
characters are transitory,  their adult characters 
unpredictable. 
 These features are widely recognized by our legal 
and cultural institutions. Ea ch bears centrally on the 
retributive, deterrent, and incapacitative justifica-
tions for life-without-parole sentences. Graham ’s rea-
sons for finding the justifications lacking apply no less to murder than other crimes. Roper  so holds. 
 Life-without-parole homicide sentences for young 
teens are vanishingly rare. Homicides by young teens 
are themselves infrequent . No pragmatic difficulty – 
including the doctrinal problem of drawing an age 6 
line – warrants abandoning all Graham ’s logic in 
murder cases. 
--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------  
 
ARGUMENT 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL LOGIC OF ROPER V. 
SIMMONS  AND GRAHAM V. FLORIDA  CON-
TROLS THIS CASE.  
 In recent years, this Court has twice addressed 
the application of the Eighth Amendment to harsh 
penalties imposed on children. Each time, it has 
recognized that the substantial differences between children and adults are constitutionally relevant. In 
Roper v. Simmons , 543 U.S. 551 (2005), the Court 
found that, even in the most serious murder cases, three general differences between adolescents and 
adults “demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot 
with reliability be classified among the worst of-fenders.” Id. at 569. As compared to adults, teenagers 
have “[a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped 
sense of responsibility”; they “are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pres-
sures”; and their character “is not as well formed.” Id. 
at 569-70 (citation omitted). Because these differ-ences make juveniles less culpable than adults, this 
Court concluded that “[w]hen a juvenile offender 
commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfei-ture of some of the most basic liberties, but the State 
cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a 
mature understanding of his own humanity.” Id. at 
573-74. 7 
 In Graham v. Florida , 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010), the 
Court recognized that the same differences between 
children and adults are relevant to the constitution-
ality of sentences of life imprisonment without parole. Id. at 2026-27. Reviewing th e case of a 16-year-old 
convicted of armed burglary, the Court repeated 
Roper ’s reasoning “that because juveniles have less-
ened culpability they are less deserving of the most 
severe punishments” ( id. at 2026) in concluding 
categorically that life without parole is excessive for juvenile nonhomicide offenders ( id. at 2030). Thus, 
this Court has now held: (1) that even those juveniles 
who have committed the most aggravated murders cannot be treated as equivalent to adults in Eighth 
Amendment excessive-punishment analysis ( Roper , 
543 U.S. at 570-74) and (2) that similar considera-tions – taking account of the categorical differences 
between juvenile and adult offenders – must inform 
Eighth Amendment analysis of the permissibility of imposing life-without-par ole sentences on juveniles 
(Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026-29). 
 Graham  began this latter, specific analysis by 
tracking and reaffirming Roper ’s reading of the well-
informed contemporary understanding of the common characteristics of young people. It cited scientific 
studies of adolescent brain structure and functioning 
which confirm the daily experience of parents every-where that teenagers are still undeveloped personali-
ties, labile and situation-dependent, impulse-driven, 
peer-sensitive, and largely lacking in the mechanisms 
of self-control which almost all of them will gain later 8 
in life. It was these ubiquito us features of youth that 
led the Court to conclude that “it would be misguided 
to equate the failings of a minor with those of an 
adult” ( Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026 [citing Roper , 543 
U.S. at 569-70]) and that  the Eighth Amendment 
“forbid[s] States from making the judgment at the 
outset that . . . [young] o ffenders never will be fit to 
reenter society” ( 130 S. Ct. at 2030). 
 Logically, the identical features of youth compel 
two additional conclusions. First, adolescents’ “less-
ened culpability” cannot rationally be supposed to 
be crime-specific. Whatever developmental immatur-ity, impulsivity, and situational vulnerability set the 
scene for a teenager’s participation in a home-
invasion robbery will be operating similarly when he or she is drawn into conduct constituting robbery-
murder. Second, by every measure deemed relevant 
in Roper  and Graham , the younger a child is, the 
more compelling are the distinctions between chil-
dren and adults and the les s culpable children are as 
a class compared to adults. And in the case of chil-dren 14 or younger, nationwide practice unmistak-
ably reinforces these conclusions: life-without-parole 
sentences for murder in th is age group are particu-
larly rare. Thus, every factor which the Court consid-
ered crucial for the results in Roper  and Graham  
equally or more strongly compels the invalidation of Kuntrell Jackson’s life-without-parole sentence.

A. The Components of This Court’s Decisions 
in Roper  and Graham 
1. Children Are Different From Adults in 
Ways That Bear Directly on the Question 
of Culpability Central to Eighth Amend-
ment Excessiveness Analysis.  
 The core of this Court’s reasoning in Roper  and 
Graham  is that children are not simply miniature 
adults. Through no fault of their own, they are at a 
unique stage of development that makes them peculi-
arly susceptible to physical and psychological pres-sures toward risk-taking, and they are not yet 
adequately equipped with the capacity for mature 
behavioral controls. They lack  the resources to choose 
their environments and avoid negative influences; 
those environments are created and controlled by the 
adults around them. Because “their characters are ‘not as well formed,’ ” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026 
(quoting Roper , 543 U.S. at 570), they have the innate 
potential for change and rehabilitation. Society’s recognition of these well-known facts is reflected both 
in its actual practices when sentencing teens con-
victed of violent crimes and in its innumerable laws designed to protect teens from dangers including 
their own immature judgment. 
 
  10 
a. This Court Has Recognized That Chil-
dren Are Involuntarily and Partic-
ularly Susceptible to Physical and 
Psychological Drives That Can Lead 
Them Into Criminal Behavior.  
 Roper  and Graham  both recognized that a salient 
difference between children and adults is that chil-
dren’s immaturity and turbulent impulses render 
them peculiarly susceptible to engaging in thought-less, rash, risky behavior. A “ ‘lack of maturity and an 
underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in 
youth more often than in ad ults and are more under-
standable among the young. These qualities often 
result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and 
decisions.’ ” Roper , 543 U.S. at 569 (citation omitted); 
accord : Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2028; and see id. at 
2032, observing that teens hav e “[d]ifficulty in weigh-
ing long-term consequences” and “a corresponding impulsiveness.” Thus, “ ‘adolescents are overrepre-
sented statistically in virtually every category of 
reckless behavior.’ ” Roper , 543 U.S. at 569 (citation 
omitted). 
 
b. This Court Has Recognized That Chil-
dren Innately Lack Mature Behavioral Controls.  
 Both Roper  and Graham  also recognized that 
teens have underdeveloped capacities for behavioral 
control. Roper  noted that “scientific and sociological 
studies” of adolescent development confirm what “any parent knows”: teens lack ad ult powers of self-control. 11 
543 U.S. at 569. In Graham , the Court found Roper ’s 
conclusions buttressed by “developments in psychol-
ogy and brain science conti nu[ing] to show fundamen-
tal differences between juvenile and adult minds. For example, parts of the brain involved in behavior con-
trol continue to mature through late adolescence.” 
130 S. Ct. at 2026. These findings informed the Court’s judgment that “ ‘the case for retribution is not 
as strong with a minor as with an adult’ ” and that 
“ ‘juveniles will be less susc eptible to deterrence.’ ” Id. 
at 2028 (citation omitted). 
 
c. This Court Has Recognized That Chil-
dren, Through No Fault of Their Own, Lack Resources Necessary to Choose 
Their Environment and Mode of Life.  
 Roper  and Graham  also recognized that children 
lack both legal and practical capacity to escape from harmful environments. Teens “are more vulnerable or 
susceptible to negative influences and outside pres-
sures, including peer pressure.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 
569; see also  Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026. They “have 
less control, or less experience  with control, over their 
own environment.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 569. For this 
reason, “ ‘youth is more than a chronological fact. It is 
a time and condition of life when a person may be 
most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.’ ” Id. (citation omitted). 
 12 
d. This Court Has Recognized That Chil-
dren Are Not Solely Responsible for the 
Conditions That Have Shaped Them.  
 This Court has also recognized that children are, 
in A.E. Housman’s sense, “stranger[s] and afraid / In 
a world . . . [they] never made.”1 The adults around 
them largely dictate and th erefore share responsibil-
ity for the circumstances of their lives. “ ‘[A]s legal minors, [juveniles] lack the freedom that adults have 
to extricate themselves from a criminogenic setting.’ ” 
Roper , 543 U.S. at 569 (citation omitted). Teens’ “own 
vulnerability and comparative lack of control over 
their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a 
greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environ-
ment.” Id. at 570.  
 
e. This Court Has Recognized That Chil-
dren Are Works-In-Progress, Capable 
of Change and Likely to Change.  
 A central tenet of both Roper  and Graham  was 
that the final character of a child is as yet unknown and unknowable because children have an inherent 
potential for growth, change, rehabilitation. “ ‘[T]he 
relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are 
transient; as individuals mature, the impetuousness 
and recklessness that may dominate in younger years 
 
 1 Last Poems, XII in Collected Poems  117 (2d ed. 1961). 13 
can subside.’ ” Roper , 543 U.S. at 570 (citation omit-
ted). “The reality that juven iles still struggle to define 
their identity means it is less supportable to conclude 
that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.” Id. at 
570. Even in the case of an aggravated homicide, a 
juvenile’s culpability cannot be equated with that of an adult, because “a greate r possibility exists that a 
minor’s character deficiencies will be reformed.” Id.; 
accord Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026-27. 
 This Court has also recognized that, not only are 
teens capable of change, but most teens actually will change as an inevitable part of growing up. “ ‘For 
most teens, [risky or antis ocial] behaviors are fleet-
ing; they cease with maturi ty as individual identity 
becomes settled. Only a relatively small proportion of 
adolescents who experiment in risky or illegal activi-
ties develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior that persist into adulthood.’ ” Roper , 543 U.S. at 570 
(citation omitted). For this reason, the Graham  Court 
found that: 
To justify life without parole on the assump-
tion that the juvenile offender forever will be a danger to society requires the sentencer to 
make a judgment that the juvenile is incorri-
gible. The characteristics of juveniles make that judgment questionable. “It is difficult 
even for expert psychologists to differentiate 
between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immatur-
ity, and the rare juvenile offender whose 14 
crime reflects irreparable corruption.” Roper , 
[543 U.S.]  at 572. 
Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2029.  
 
f. This Court Has Recognized That Objec-
tive Indicators Demo nstrate a Societal 
Understanding That the Preceding 
Conditions Exist and That They Are 
Relevant to Culpability.  
 Both Roper  and Graham  also noted that these 
facts of adolescent life are pervasively acknowledged 
in a societal consensus marked by objective indicators 
of several sorts. “In recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost 
every State prohibits those under 18 years of age 
from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 569.
2 In Roper , 
the Court found that even when juveniles have com-
mitted aggravated homicides, “the rejection of the juvenile death penalty in the majority of States; the 
infrequency of its use even where it remains on the 
books; and the consistency in the trend toward aboli-tion of the practice . . . provide sufficient evidence 
that today our society views juveniles . . . as ‘categori-
cally less culpable than th e average criminal.’ ” 543 
 
 2 See also J.D.B. v. North Carolina , 131 S. Ct. 2394, 2403 
(2011): “The law has historically  reflected the same assumption 
that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise ma-ture judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to under-stand the world around them.” 15 
U.S. at 567 (citation omitted). In Graham , the Court 
identified only 123 juveniles sentenced to life with- 
out parole for nonhomicide offenses “stretching back 
many years,” and found that “only 11 jurisdic- tions nationwide in fact i mpose life without parole 
sentences on juvenile nonhomicide offenders – and 
most of those do so quite rarely.” 130 S. Ct. at 2024. 
Considering that many thousands of juveniles are 
arrested for serious felonies  each year, “in proportion 
to the opportunities for its imposition” such sentences are extremely rare. Id. at 2025. The Court concluded 
that the rarity of these se ntences reflected a societal 
consensus that the incorrigibility necessary to justify a life without parole sentence  is “ ‘inconsistent with 
youth.’ ” Id. at 2029 (citation omitted). 
*     *     *  
 The following sections of this brief will: (1) show 
that this Court’s recognition of the special nature and circumstances of adolescence is factually indisput-
able, (2) detail the specific  components of the differ-
ence between young adolescents and adults, and (3) show how those details  confirm the full applica-
bility of the reasoning of Roper  and Graham  to chil-
dren like Kuntrell Jackson. Ultimately, nothing in the constitutional analysis established by the Roper  and 
Graham  opinions and nothing in the real-world facts 
and conditions relevant to that analysis permits a rational distinction between life without parole for 
children who commit murder and life without parole 
for children who commit ot her serious crimes, partic-
ularly in the case of children 14 and younger. 16 
B. How the Reasoning of Roper  and Graham  
Applies to Young Adolescents Sentenced to 
Life Imprisonment Without Parole  
 Graham  pinpoints the constitutional vice in 
sentencing children to life imprisonment without parole: a lifelong, unchangeable sentence “requires 
the sentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is 
incorrigible . . . [while t]he characteristics of juveniles 
make that judgment quest ionable.” 130 S. Ct. at 
2029. Because a child is not yet what he will be, “[a] 
life without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth and 
maturity.” Id. at 2029. To declare a 14-year-old like 
Kuntrell Jackson forever unfit to live in society vio-lates “the duty of the government to respect the dig-
nity of all persons,” Roper , 543 U.S. at 560. This is all 
the more unjustifiable because children’s “struggle to define their identity,” id. at 570, is a struggle, bring-
ing with it unique, temporary impairments and vul-
nerabilities that reduce their criminal culpability. 
 
1. The Scientific Consensus on Adolescent 
Development  
 Contemporary psychological, sociological, and 
neurological studies converge
3 to demonstrate that 
 
 3 The convergence of the research in multiple disciplines 
makes the scientific cons ensus particularly strong. See Laurence 
Steinberg, Should the Science of Adolescent Brain Development 
Inform Public Policy? , 64 Am. Psychol. 739, 744 (2009). 17 
the factors which Roper  and Graham  recognized as 
critical for Eighth Amendment analysis in the case of 
children – changeability, immature judgment, under-
developed capacity for self-regulation, vulnerability to negative influences and ou tside pressures, and a lack 
of control over either their own impulses or their 
environment – are at their peak in young teens. This is the onset of the crucial  developmental period of 
adolescence, bringing radical transformations that 
include the stressful physical changes of puberty (in-creases in height and weight and sex-related physiol-
ogy), followed later by progr essive gains in capacity 
for reasoned, mature judgment, impulse control, and autonomy.
4 A “rapid and dramatic increase in dopa-
minergic activity within the socioemotional system 
around the time of puberty” drives the young adoles-cent toward increased sensation-seeking and risk-
taking; “this increase in reward seeking precedes the 
structural maturation of th e cognitive control system 
and its connections to areas of the socioemotional 
system, a maturational process that is gradual, un-
folds over the course of adolescence, and permits more advanced self-regulation and impulse control.”

“The temporal gap between the arousal of the socio-
emotional system, which is an early adolescent devel-
opment, and the full maturation of the cognitive 
control system, which occurs later, creates a period of 
heightened vulnerability to risk taking during middle 
adolescence.”6 
 These biological and psychosocial developments 
explain what is obvious to parents, teachers, and any adult who reflects back on his or her own teenage years: 13- and 14-year-old middle-schoolers lack the maturity, independence, and future orientation that adults, and even older teens, have acquired over the course of adolescence. While 16- and 17-year-olds are working after-school jobs to save up for their first car and applying to college,  13- and 14-year-olds are 
agonizing about who will si t with them at lunch. 
Graduating seniors are thinking about their future careers and families, while  seventh-graders are fix-
ated on who will be their “BFF”
7 that day. Among 
adolescents, young teens have the least capacity to 
imagine consequences, regulate their wildly-shifting emotions, and resist peer  pressure, and the most 
capacity for change, precisely because they are at the

a. Young Adolescents Have Not Yet De-
veloped the Capacity to Make Mature 
and Responsible Decisions.  
 By the standards of adul ts or even older adoles-
cents,9 the judgment of young teenagers is multiply 
handicapped: they lack life experience and back-ground knowledge to inform their choices; they strug-
gle to generate options and to imagine consequences; 
and, perhaps for good reason, they lack the self-confidence necessary to make reasoned judgments 
and stick by them.

environmental characteristics and demands. . . .” Spear, supra

adolescents; incidence of depression is often highest in adoles-cence; and teens experience sleep problems, great extremes in mood, and peak anxiety and self-consciousness).

at this developmental stage hampers their ability to 
make the kind of judgments at 14 that they will 
comfortably handle at 17. Like  a car with a powerful 
accelerator but weak brakes, a young teenager’s brain is fully developed in the part responsible for emo-
tional arousal and sensitivity to peer pressure (the 
gas pedal), but the parts in the frontal lobes that control impulses and allow long-term thinking, plan-
ning, and resistance to peer  pressure (the brakes) are 
still developing.
11 At 13 and 14, the major transfor-
mation in brain structure t hat will result in a sophis-
ticated system of circuitry between the frontal lobe 
and the rest of the brain, enabling adults to exercise cognitive control over their behavior, is barely under-
way.

increases the efficiency of information processing and supports 
the integration of the widely distributed circuitry needed for complex behavior; it is the wiring of connections among and between the frontal regions and the rest of the brain. Immature myelination is thought to make adolescents vulnerable to im-pulsive behavior, while the increased processing speed facili-tated by myelination facilitates cognitive complexity. Geier & Luna, supra  note 4, at 216; see also  Giedd, supra , at 80. White 
matter in the brain increases in a linear fashion, so that older adolescents and adults benefit from a greater number of myelinated neurons than younger teens. Id.  
 Cortical gray matter is thickest early in adolescence. Id. at 
82. Later in the teenage years, this cortical gray matter under-
goes significant “pruning,” making more efficient that part of the brain responsible for inhibiting  impulses and assessing risk. Id.;

Immature Brains Make Them Less Culpable than Adults , 9 
Quinnipiac Health L.J. 1, 12 (2005); Spear, supra  note 4, at 439.  
 Pruning typically is not comp lete until middle to late 
adolescence, and the parts of the brain that process risk and control executive functioning do not finish myelinating until late adolescence or early adulthood. Jay N. Giedd et al., Brain Devel-

 Young adolescents find themselves behind the 
wheel of this fundamentally deficient vehicle with no 
driver’s ed instruction to guide them. Their hunger 
for thrilling speed easily overwhelms their scant capacity to apprehend the possibility of a serious 
crash; they have weak brakes and very limited visi-
bility ahead or behind. This  is why no State permits 
young adolescents to drive. That older adolescents are 
issued driver’s licenses reflec ts the fact that they are 
further along in development: – they have more experience in making deci sions; their brain circuitry 
is more efficient; the hormonal storm of puberty is not 
brand-new to them; and th ey have a better view of 
their futures.
13 Sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds still 
are risky, bad drivers compared to adults,14 but there 
is clear consensus that 14-ye ar-olds are so lacking in 
maturity and decisionmaking capability that they 
should not even be allowed to take the wheel.

 14 Recognizing this fact, all States but one have enacted 
some sort of graduated licensing law, which “phases in unre-stricted driving by allowing beginners to get their initial behind-the-wheel experiences under conditions that reduce the risk of collision.” Christine Branche et al., Graduated Licensing for 
Teens,  30 J.L. Med. & Ethics 146, 146-47 (2002). 23 
b. Young Adolescents Are Especially Sus-
ceptible to Risk-Taking Impulses and 
Negative Peer Influences.  
 Early teenagers’ propensity for risk-taking exac-
erbates their decisionmaking difficulties. It is uni-versally recognized that adolescence is characterized 
by risk-taking behavior; contemporary neurological 
science establishes that this is a function of physical 
brain development as well as a socially scripted phase 
of the passage from childhood to maturity.
15 
For the purpose of understanding young adolescent behavior relative to that of adults, and even older 
teens, the critical observat ions are that (1) most ad-
olescent risk-taking is a group phenomenon and (2) young adolescents are the most vulnerable to peer-
group influence. 
 Parents, teachers, and observers of teenagers the 
world over know that social interactions and affilia-
tions with peers take on out-sized importance in adolescence. Teens spend about one-third of waking 
hours talking with peers (but only 8% with adults).
16 
While all adolescents are more peer-oriented than adults, the research indicates that vulnerability to peer 
pressure, especially for boys, increases during early 
 
 15 E.g.,  Steinberg, Risk Taking , supra  note 11, at 56-58;

adolescence to an all-time high in eighth grade.17 The 
need to fit in with the peer group – to impress peers 
with daredevil antics and smart-alecky comments – 
exerts enormous influence on the behavior of young adolescents, more so than du ring pre-adolescence or 
late adolescence.
18 Indeed, extreme vulnerability to 
peer influence (especially wh en it is to do something 
bad) is a defining characteristic of young adolescence, 
reflected in the fact that it is statistically aberrant for 
boys to refrain from minor criminal behavior during this period.
19 
 Most teens grow out of this behavior as a part of 
the maturation process.20 Typically, the ability to re-
sist peer influence and to regulate internal impulses 
matures in middle or late adolescence.21 Adolescents’ 
capacity to extricate themselves from a group or other 
setting where they are likely  to get into trouble also

increases with age. Denied  the rights and privileges 
that accrue at age 18, all adolescents have less ability 
than adults to free themselves from morally toxic or 
dangerous environments. But the youngest teens are worst off. State and federal laws meant to protect 
young teens from exploitation and from their own 
underdeveloped sense of responsibility – including restrictions on driving, working, and leaving school 
– operate conversely to disable a 14-year-old from 
escaping an abusive parent, a dysfunctional or violent household, or a dangerous neighborhood. 
 
c. Young Adolescents Have Not Yet Be-
gun to Form Their Own Identities or to Imagine Their Futures.  
 Young teens, to a much greater extent than 
adults or even older teens, are handicapped by their 
inability to envision who they want to be or what 
they want to achieve in the future. Young teens are readily distinguishable from 15- and 16-year-olds by 
their excruciatingly low s elf-esteem and high self-
consciousness, which fixate them on the instantane-ous present.
22 Not until age 16 do adolescents obtain 
something close to a mature sense of perspective. And

Arnett, Reckless Behavior in Adolescence , 12 Dev. Rev. 339, 344 
(1992); Steinberg, Social Neuroscience  at 90. 26 
not until the late teens or early twenties do they 
begin to form a coherent identity – although teens 16 
and older do have a more ma ture sense of self than 
adolescents under 15.23 
 Very few young adolescents think about their 
future beyond age 30.24 As adolescents grow older, 
they become increasingly focused upon tasks of self-
development, contemplating future education, occu-
pation, and family. With this added perspective, their ability to plan and to realistically anticipate long-
term consequences improves.
25 But at 13 and 14, 
middle-schoolers tend to struggle with planning even how to get tonight’s homework done in time to watch 
their favorite television program. 
 The flip side of young adolescents’ underdevel-
oped sense of self is that they have, relative to older 
individuals, more potential to change and develop positive character traits as they grow up. A typical 
14-year-old who acts irresponsibly in reaction to a 
thrilling impulse or peer pr essure is not irretrievably 
depraved or permanently flawed. Nothing about his 
character is permanent, and he has years of develop-
ment ahead, during which he can (and, in most cases, will) grow into a moral, law-abiding adult.

Dozens of longitudinal  studies have shown 
that the vast majority of adolescents who 
commit antisocial acts desist from such activ-
ity as they mature into adulthood and that only a small percentage – between five and 
ten percent, according to most studies – be-
come chronic offenders. Thus, nearly all ju-venile offenders are adolescent limited. . . .  
[M]ost juvenile offenders mature out of crime 
. . . and . . . will desist whether or not they 
are caught, arrested, prosecuted or sanc-
tioned . . . .

 This Court has recognized that adolescents, as a 
class, lack the maturity, aut onomy, and self-governing 
capacity of adults. Roper , 543 U.S. at 569-71; Eddings 
v. Oklahoma , 455 U.S. 104, 115-16 (1982). Within 
that class, which is defined by the transition from childhood to adulthood, there are gradations in ca-
pability that correlate with age. As is readily observ-
able and widely accepted, the youngest adolescents are the least mature, most susceptible to internal im-
pulses and external influences, and have the greatest 
capacity for change.

2. The Constitutional Significance of Young 
Adolescents’ Limited Cognitive Capacity 
and Psychosocial Immaturity  
 Roper  and Graham  teach that the special vulner-
abilities and frailties of ad olescence bear directly on 
the Eighth Amendment calculus of personal culpabil-
ity. See supra  pp. 6-15 . T h i s  i s  i n  a c c o r d  w i t h  t h e  
scientific consensus and common-sense understand-ing of parents and teachers  everywhere that a 14-
year-old is not a 17-year-old and that neither is an 
adult. Young adolescents’ culpability is diminished because they have not yet reached the level of cogni-
tive and psychosocial development that permits 
adults to make mature decisions, forecast conse-quences, and control their impulses. The sensation-
seeking proclivity and lack of impulse control charac-
teristic of adolescents further support the conclusion that “their irresponsible conduct is not as morally 
reprehensible as that of an adult.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 
561. 
 Young adolescents in particular will necessarily  
change over time, either as a result of natural matu-ration or through the intervention worked by convic-
tion and sentence. To pass a life-without-parole 
sentence on a young adolescent – a final, inflexible, reconsideration-resistant judgment that this still-
incompletely-formed individual will never  be fit to 
participate in civil society – is not merely premature but oblivious to “the duty of the government to re-
spect the dignity of all persons,” Roper , 543 U.S. at 
560. 29 
C. Hundreds of State and Federal Laws Recog-
nize the Special Vulnerabilities and Defi-
ciencies of Young Adolescents.  
 Roper  and Graham  do not stand alone in recog-
nizing the special fragility of young adolescents and its implications for the degr ees of responsibility and 
protection which they should be given – including 
protection from themselves. See J.D.B. v. North 
Carolina , 131 S. Ct. 2394, 2403 (2011) (“[T]he com-
mon law has reflected the re ality that children are not 
adults,” and has erected safe guards to “ ‘secure them 
from hurting themselves by their own improvident 
acts.’ ” (citation omitted)); Eddings , 455 U.S. at 115-16 
(“Our history is replete wi th laws and judicial recog-
nition that minors, especially in their earlier years, 
generally are less mature and responsible than adults.”); 
Roper , 543 U.S. at 581-88, Appendices B-D (collecting 
State laws on voting, jury service, and marriage with-
out parental consent). Numerous State and federal laws 
provide special protections fo r early adolescents while, 
at the same time, limiting their freedoms, consistent 
with the understanding that young teens are not 
mature enough for a wide r ange of responsibilities and 
privileges – from the obvious and universal (driving,

 29 All States issue at least restricted driver’s licenses to 16- 
or 17-year-olds. No State will issue even a learner’s permit to a 13-year-old, and the vast majority will not issue a learner’s permit to a 14-year-old. See App. A to Pet. Br., Miller  v. Ala-

works, hunting,32 tattoos33). See App. A to Pet. Br., 
Miller v. Alabama , 10-9646 [hereinafter Miller  App.], 
collecting State laws differentiating between younger and older adolescents. These ubiquitous regulations 
manifest the breadth of the consensus that the capac-
ities and vulnerabilities of  young adolescents differ 
substantially from those of adults and even of older 
teens.

Young Adolescents Are Especially Vul-
nerable and Provides Heightened Pro-

are especially vulnerable to exploitation, abuse, and 
 
 30 Most States, while forbidding persons under 18 to marry 
without parental consent ( see Roper , App. D), do allow 16- and 
17-year-olds to marry with parental consent; but they deny that 
privilege to younger teens. See Miller  App. 
 31 All States differentiate between younger and older ado-
lescents in regard to consent to sexual activity. A majority sets 
the minimum age of general consent at 16. Some States allow 13- or 14- or 15-year-olds to consen t to sexual activity with other 
adolescents; but States generally do not allow a 14-year-old child 
to consent to sex with an adult. See Miller  App.; Richard A. 
Posner & Katharine B. Silbaugh, A Guide to America’s Sex Laws

susceptible to negative influences, criminal statutes 
specifically prohibit the luring or enticing of young teens for the purpose of proposing illicit conduct.

that appearing in court traumatizes young adoles-cents to such a degree that they require shielding 
when testifying against their abusers.

2. State and Federal Law Recognizes That 
Early Adolescents Are Immature, Impul-
sive, and Relatively Ir responsible, as Well 
as That They Are Exceedingly Suscepti-
ble to Coercion, by Limiting Their Rights 
and Responsibilities in Many Aspects of Life.  
 The law seeks to prote ct young adolescents from 
exploitation and from their own lack of judgment in 
diverse contexts: education, employment, economic transactions, and so forth. Thirteen- and fourteen-
year-olds universally are deemed too immature and 
irresponsible to drive, vote, serve on juries, drink alcohol, gamble, or marry even with parental consent. 
See Miller  App. All States require children under 16 
to attend school.
40 All States and the federal govern-
ment limit the type and amount of work young teens 
can do41 and most jurisdictions have adjudged early 
adolescents incapable of entering into contracts.42 
 
 40 Mark G. Yudof et al.,  Education Policy and the Law  1 (4th 
ed. 2002).  
 41 See, e.g.,  Mo. Ann. Stat. §§ 294.011, 294.021, 294.040 
(forbidding most employment of  children under 14 and limiting 
employment of 14 and 15 year olds); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 42, 44 (limiting employment of 14- and 15-year-olds more strictly than 16- and 17-year- olds); 29 U.S.C. §§ 203(l), 212, 
213(c) (regulating child labor and distinguishing between teens younger than 16 and teens 16 or 17 years old). See also Miller  
App. 
 
42 See, e.g.,  Ala. Code § 27-14-5 (minors 15 and older can 
contract for certain kinds of in surance); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 
§ 20-1106 (same); Colo. Rev. St at. Ann. § 10-4-104 (same, 16 and

 As this Court has recognized, “the legal disquali-
fications placed on childre n as a class – e.g., limita-
tions on their ability to alienate property, enter a 
binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consent – exhibit the settled under-
standing that the differentiating characteristics of 
youth are universal.” J.D.B. , 131 S. Ct. at 2403-04. 
Although jurisdictions draw lines for these protective 
and restrictive provisions at various points in early- 
to mid-adolescence, they universally bar 14-year-olds from activities that require maturity and responsible 
judgment. See Miller  App. That these activities are 
permitted for many late adolescents demonstrates society’s widespread recognition that early adoles-
cents are developmentally distinct from adults and 
older teens – that 14-year-olds specifically lack the developmental capacity to bear such responsibilities, 
but that their incapacity w ill abate over the course of 
adolescence. 
 
D. The Distinctive Characteristics of Young 
Adolescents Recognized in State, Federal, 
and Constitutional Law Undermine the Le-
gitimacy and Utility of Life-Without-Parole 
Sentences for Young Teens.  
 Precisely the same reasoning that dictated this 
Court’s decisions in Roper  and Graham  compels the 
 
older); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 500.2205 (same); N.Y. Educ. 
Law § 281 (infants 16 and older cannot disaffirm education loans). 35 
conclusion that a sentence of life imprisonment with-
out parole imposed on a 14-year-old child for any of-
fense violates the Eighth Amendment. As we have 
seen, the analysis of Roper  and Graham  centers on 
the disjunction between a punishment that declares 
an offender finally and forever unfit to exist in society 
and the uniquely transitory characteristics of youth that preclude any such declaration. Roper  and Graham  
identify those characteristics, the kinds of scientific 
and legal sources from whic h additional information 
about them can be obtained , and the ways in which 
that information bears upon the Eighth Amendment’s 
guiding principles. When the constitutional method-ology of Roper  and Graham  is applied to the signa-
ture characteristics of young adolescents spelled out 
in the preceding pages of this brief, a firm basis emerges for the finding that a child of 14 – even one 
convicted of murder – cannot legitimately be con-
signed to lifelong incarceration with no possibility of ever being redeemed and re ady for release on parole. 
 
1. Some of These Characteristics Bear Di-
rectly on the Degree of Culpability That Can Be Found to Attach to Adolescent 
Criminal Behavior.  
 Children of 13 and 14 are especially vulnerable to 
each of the frailties and limitations that Roper  and 
Graham  regarded as relevant to culpability. They are 
neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally hard-
wired for sensation-seeking, impulsivity, poor fore-
sight, worse judgment, and control failure. They are 36 
uniquely sensitive to peer pressure and bad external 
influences. They did not and cannot choose the condi-
tions of upbringing that make them what they are, 
and the very protective laws that recognize their in-capacities have the correlative effect of limiting their 
ability to escape from those conditions. Their exis-
tence is dominated by the “struggle to define their identity,” Roper , 543 U.S. at 570, which they are not 
yet equipped to win. Graham  reaffirmed Roper ’s 
conclusion that, even for older teens, “ ‘the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an 
adult.’ ” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2028 (citation omit-
ted). And it is still more true of younger teens that their “culpability or blameworthiness is diminished, 
to a sustantial degree, by reason of youth and imma-
turity.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 571. 
 
2. Some of These Characteristics Bear on 
the Inutility of Life Without Parole as a 
Deterrent.  
 Roper  and Graham  both explained that the 
“ ‘same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest . . . that juveniles will be 
less susceptible to deterrence.’ ” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 
2028 (citation omitted). Bec ause “adolescents are less 
oriented to the future than are adults,”
43 far-future 
consequences are less meaningful to them; it is  
 
 43 Steinberg, Graham, et al., Future Orientation  supra  note 
28, at 39. 37 
particularly difficult to imagine them planning their 
current actions by assigning heavier deterrent weight 
to a life-without-parole sent ence than to a life-with-
eligibility-for-parole sentence. Testing of individuals from 10 to 30 years of age shows “significantly lower 
planning scores among adolescents between 12 and 
15 than among younger or older individuals.”
44 Thus, 
young adolescents are “less likely to take a possible 
punishment into consideration when making deci-
sions.” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2028-29. 
 
3. Some of These Characteristics Bear on 
the Risks of Wrongful Conviction (Or De-
gree of Conviction) and on the Even 
More Serious Risks of Erroneous Judg-
ment Regarding Appropriate Sentence.  
 Graham  recognized that “even if we were to 
assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might have ‘sufficient psychological maturity, and at the same time demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,’ . . . to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionali-ty approach could with suffi cient accuracy distinguish 
the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for change.” 130 S. Ct. at 2032. We have argued above that this predictive difficulty is one of the considerations that make life-without-parole sentences inherently unsuitable for young adolescents. It also means th at if such sentences are 
 
 44 Id. at 36. 38 
permitted, there is a signific ant risk that they will be 
imposed on the wrong adolescents. 
 As Graham  found, “the features that distinguish 
juveniles from adults also put them at a significant 
disadvantage in criminal proceedings.” 130 S. Ct. at 2032. The disadvantage is gr eatest in the case of 
young adolescents because this age group tends to be 
the most cognitively and psychosocially impaired in ways that undermine the fairness and reliability of 
criminal proceedings against them. These impair-
ments not only enhance the risk of erroneous sentenc-ing decisions; they also e nhance the risk of erroneous 
convictions. “Juveniles mistrust adults and have 
limited understandings of the criminal justice system and the roles of the institutional actors within it.” Id. 
“Difficulty in weighing long-term consequences; a 
corresponding impulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel seen as part of the adult world a 
rebellious youth rejects, all can lead to poor decisions 
by one charged with a juvenile offense” and “are likely to impair the quality of a juvenile defendant’s 
representation.” Id. 
 In adult criminal proceedings, critical decisions – 
such as whether to accept a plea agreement, waive a 
jury trial, or testify – must be made by the defendant. Model Rules of Prof ’l Cond uct R. 1.2(a) . The empir-
ical evidence raises doubts about the capacity of a 
significant number of 14-ye ar-olds to make these 39 
decisions.45 And unsurprisingly, young adolescents are 
particularly susceptible to giving false confessions. 
Of young adolescents who have been exonerated in 
the United States, 69% had confessed falsely, as compared to 8% of adults and 25% of older teens.
46 
Because young adolescents more readily perceive 
short-term benefits than hard-to-imagine future out-comes, they tend to give inculpatory statements in 
order to be allowed to go home.
47 Young adolescents 
are quick to comply with the wishes of authority figures, making them highly  susceptible to police 
suggestions and pressure.

4. The Severe, Terminal Sanction of Life With-
out Parole Is Inappropriate for Young 
Adolescents Because the Retributive, De-
terrent, and Incapacitative Virtues of 
Such a Punishment Are Attenuated in 
Their Cases. 
 Graham  recognized that “[l]ife without parole is 
an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile.” 130 S. Ct. at 2028. In their abs olute condemnation of the 
remainder of a child’s life , “life without parole sen-
tences share some characteristics with death sen-tences that are shared by no other sentences.” Id. at 
2027. A sentence to lifelong incarceration “alters the 
offender’s life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable” and “deprives the convict of the most basic liberties with-
out giving hope of restoration.” Id. 
 For adolescents sentenced to life without parole, 
this permanent judgment is issued before their adult 
lives have even begun, before they have ever had the most basic freedoms to shap e their own destiny. “Un-
der this sentence, a juven ile offender will on average 
serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.” Id. at 2028. For this 
reason, “[a] 16-year-old and  a 75-year-old each sen-
tenced to life without parole receive the same pun-ishment in name only.” Id. As this Court has found, 
a life without parole sent ence imposed on a child 
“ ‘means denial of hope; it means that good behavior and character improvement are immaterial; it means 
that whatever the future mi ght hold in store for the 
mind and spirit of [the co nvict], he will remain in 41 
prison for the rest of his days.’ ” Id. at 2027 (citation 
omitted). 
 Life without parole was enacted “to deal with 
dangerous and incorrigible individuals who would be 
a constant threat to society.” Workman v. Common-
wealth , 429 S.W.2d 374, 378 (Ky. 1968). As Graham  
recognized, there is no so und basis for finding incor-
rigibility in the case of an as-yet-undeveloped young 
teen. 130 S. Ct. at 2029. Plainly put, “incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.” Id. (quoting Workman , 429 
S.W.2d at 378).
49 This is especially so in the case of 
young adolescents who still have so far to go toward their “potential to attain a mature understanding of 
. . . [their] own humanity,” Roper , 543 U.S. at 554. 
 
E. Objective Indicia Demonstrate That There 
Is a Consensus Against Imposing Sentences 
of Life Imprisonment Without Parole Upon 
Young Adolescents.  
 In gauging the acceptance or rejection of a par-
ticular criminal punishment by contemporary society, 
the Court looks to both legislative enactments and 
actual usage. Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2023; Roper , 543 
 
 49 Life without parole is not necessary to serve the peno-
logical goal of incapacitation. Life with possibility of parole 
would permit review and evaluation of an offender, as an adult, to determine whether dangerousness or incorrigibility should preclude his or her release – a determination that cannot reli-ably or accurately be made at sentencing, when a child’s charac-ter has not yet formed. 42 
U.S. at 564-67. Graham  noted that “[a]ctual sentenc-
ing practices are an important part of the Court’s 
inquiry into consensus” (130 S. Ct. at 2023) and relied 
on the fact that “[n]ationwide, there are 123 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without parole 
sentences” and that “only 11 jurisdictions nationwide 
in fact impose . . . [such] sentences” to conclude that “[t]he sentencing practice now under consideration is 
exceedingly rare.” Id. at 2025-26. 
 Roper based its finding of “sufficient evidence 
that today our society views juveniles . . . as ‘categori-
cally less culpable than the average criminal’ ” (543 U.S. at 567 (citation omitted)) partly on the observa-
tion that “even in the 20 States without a formal 
prohibition on executing juveniles, the practice is infrequent. . . . [In the past 16 years], six States have 
executed prisoners for cri mes committed as juveniles. 
In the past 10 years, only three have done so.” Id. 
at 564-65. This analysis tracked that in Atkins v. 
Virginia , 536 U.S. 304, 316 (2002), where this Court 
had “emphasized that even in the 20 States without formal prohibition, the practice of executing the men-
tally retarded was infrequent”; from 1989 to 2002, 
“only five States had executed offenders known to have an IQ under 70.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 564. 
 The touchstone of actual use makes particularly 
good sense in the context of life-without-parole sen-
tences for young adolescent s because the statutory 
authorizations for these sentences are largely the result of the unplanned interplay of two independent 
  43 
legislative developments: (i) the expansion of life-
without-parole sentences for adult crimes; and (ii) mod-
ifications of juvenile-court jurisdiction that bring a 
larger number of adolescents into adult court. These developments cannot be read as expressing any legis-
lative judgment on the specific issue of the appropri-
ateness of life without parole for adolescents. 
 
1. Life Without Parole for Young Adoles-
cents Is an Unconsidered Consequence of 
Two Distinct Legislative Developments.  
 In the last few decades,  politically popular “tough 
on crime” policies like “truth in sentencing” have greatly circumscribed parole, resulting in a dramatic 
increase in the availability of life-without-parole 
sentences for adults .
50 Simultaneously with the trend 
to stiffen penalties for ad ult offenders by expanding 
life without parole, many States responded to con-
cerns about the perceived inadequacy of the juvenile justice system to deal with violent youth crime. They 
did this principally by lowering the age at which 
children could be prosecuted in adult court.
51 These 
changes in inter-court jurisdictional boundaries or in 
transfer provisions represented an abandonment of 
 
 50 See Marc Mauer et al., The Meaning of “Life”: Long 
Prison Sentences in Context  1, 5-8, 12 (2004 ), http://sentencing 
project.org/Admin/Documents/publications/inc_meaningoflife.pdf. 
 51 See  U . S .  D e p ’ t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  O f f i c e  o f  J u v e n i l e  J u s t i c e  &

the previously prevailing regimes that were com-
monly understood to limit juvenile-court dispositions 
to detention in a juvenile facility until age 18 or 21 at 
a maximum.52 But there is no evidence of any sig-
nificant legislative consideration of the specific ques-
tion whether lifelong imprisonment without parole is 
appropriate for young adolescents. For the most part, life-without-parole sentenci ng for young adolescents 
became technically possible as an adventitious conse-
quence of the overlay of two distinct movements, neither directed to the question. 
 Graham  recognized that “the fact that transfer 
and direct charging laws make life without parole 
possible for some juvenile nonhomicide offenders does 
not justify a judgment that many States intended to 
subject such offenders to life without parole sen-
tences.” 130 S. Ct. at 2025. This is so because such 
statutes reveal at most the age at which States have determined a child is “ ‘old enough to be tried in crim-
inal court for serious crimes (or too old to be dealt 
with effectively in juvenile court),  but tells us nothing 
about the judgment these States have made regard- 
ing the appropriate punishment for such youthful of-
fenders .’ ” Id. (quoting Thompson v. Oklahoma , 487 
U.S. 815, 829 n.24 (1988) (plurality opinion) with 
Thompson ’s emphasis); accord Thompson , 487 U.S. at 
 
 52 See, e.g.,  Lisa S. Beresford, Is Lowering the Age at Which 
Juveniles Can Be Transferred to Adult Criminal Court the Answer to Juvenile Crime? A State-by-State Assessment , 37 San 
Diego L. Rev. 783-86, 792 (2000). 45 
850-51 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Graham  and 
Thompson  teach that legislative judgments about the 
appropriate penalty for a child offender cannot be 
inferred from a statute that simply regulates the boundary between juvenile-court and adult-court ju-
risdictions. 
 
2. Virtually Every Stat e That Has Expressly 
Addressed the Question of the Minimum 
Age of Eligibility for a Life-Without-
Parole Sentence Has Set the Age Above 
14.  
 Where States have expressly addressed the min-
imum age at which life imprisonment without parole may be imposed, they have all but unanimously set 
that age above 14. See, e.g.,  La. Child. Code Ann. art. 
857(B) (“Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a fourteen -year-old who is transferred 
pursuant to this Article and subsequently convicted 
shall not be confined for such conviction beyond his thirty-first birthday.”); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 17-
22.5-104(2)(d)(IV) (minimum  age for life without 
parole is 18); Cal. Penal Code § 190.5(b) (minimum age for life without parole for first-degree murder is 
16);
53 Ind. Code Ann. § 35-50-2-3(b)(2) (minimum age 
 
 53 The California Court of Appeal has invalidated a code 
provision permitting a juvenile  kidnapper under age 16 to be 
sentenced to life without parole,  Cal. Penal Code § 209(a), as 
violating the federal and California Constitutions. In re Nu ñez, 
93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 242, 258-59 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009). 46 
for life without parole for murder is 16); D.C. Code 
§ 22-2104 (minimum age for li fe without parole for 
murder is 18); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21-6618 (minimum 
age for life without parole for capital murder is 18); 
Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 640. 040 (minimum age for life 
without parole for murder is 18); Mont. Code Ann. 
§ 46-18-222 (exempting all children under 18 from restrictions on parole eligibility); Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. 
§ 161.620 (prohibiting life without parole for children 
under 18 waived from juvenile court); Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 12.31(a)(1), (b)(1 ) (prohibiting life with-
out parole for children under 17 waived from juvenile 
court). The outlier, Massachusetts, sets the minimum age at 14 (for life without parole for murder). Mass. 
Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 119, § 72B.
54 
 The near-complete absence of express legislative 
approval of such a sentence for 13- and 14-year-olds 
reflects a consensus that the sentence would be ex-cessively harsh punishment as applied to a young 
adolescent. 
 
 
 54 Some death-penalty States explicitly abolished the death 
penalty for juveniles by provisions that arguably authorize life without parole. See, e.g.,  730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1; Md. 
Code Ann. Crim. Law § 2-202(b )(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 
§ 176.025 (amended by 2011 Nev. Stat. Ch. 12 to comply with Graham ); N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 14-17; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 
§ 2929.03(E); Va. Code  Ann. § 18.2-10(a); cf. Mo. Ann. Stat. 
§ 565.020 (amended 1990). 47 
3. In Actual Practice, the Imposition of a 
Life-Without-Parole Sentence on a Young 
Teenager Is an Aberrant, Exceedingly 
Rare Occurrence.  
 Although not explicitly addressing the issue of 
the propriety of life-without-parole sentences for the 
youngest teens, statutes in 26 States have the effect of exposing 13-year-olds to such a sentence;
55 and 
statutes in an additional 13 States make the sentence 
possible for 14-year-olds.56 In the light of this broad 
theoretical availability, the infrequency with which 
13- and 14-year-olds are actually sentenced to life 
without parole is striking . It evidences nationwide 
repudiation, not acceptance, of the sentence for chil-
dren of these young ages. 
 There are only about 79 persons in the United 
States under life-without-parole sentences for of-
fenses committed at age 13 or 14.57 This number is 
 
 55 See infra  Appendix A. 
 56 See infra  Appendix B. 
 57 J.A. 19, 21; Equal Justice Initiative, Cruel and Unusual: 
Sentencing 13- and 14-Year-Old Children to Die in Prison  20 
(2007) [hereinafter Cruel and Unusual ] (reporting results of a 
nationwide study identifying 73 children serving life-without-parole sentences for offenses at age 13 or 14). Since the publica-tion of this report, there has been some fluctuation in the number: some children originally identified have obtained relief from their convictions or sentences (including some under this Court’s decision in Graham ), and some new sentences have also 
been imposed. Counsel’s extens ive research sets the current 
total number of 13- and 14-year-old children serving sentences of life without parole at 79 plus or minus one or two. 48 
especially indicative of nationwide repudiation when 
one considers that 79 represents the total accumu-
lation  of life-without-parole sentences imposed on 
13- and 14-year-olds “stretching back many years” because “a juvenile sentenced to life without parole 
is likely to live in prison for decades.” Graham , 130 
S. Ct. at 2024. An accumulation of approximately 79 life-without-parole sentences since 1971
58 in a nation 
whose population rose from  200,000,000 to more than 
to 311,000,000 during those 40 years is a singularly unimpressive showing of institutional or public 
acceptance. 
 The number 79 bears comparison with the paral-
lel figures for the classes involved in Graham  and 
Roper.  When Graham  found a national consensus 
against life-without-parole sentences for children con-
victed of nonhomicides, there were 123 individuals 
serving such sentences.  130 S. Ct. at 2024. When 
Roper  recognized a national consensus against death 
sentences for juveniles, 71 juvenile offenders were 
under that sentence.
59  
 
 58 The earliest sentence imposed upon a 14-year-old juvenile 
currently serving life-without-parole was Brian Wilson’s, dating from 1971. See Commonwealth v. Wallace , 500 A.2d 816 (Pa. 
Super. Ct. 1985). 
 
59 Victor L. Streib, Death Sentences and Executions for 
Juvenile Crimes , January 1, 1973-February 28, 2005  3 (Oct. 
2005), http://www.law.onu.edu/faculty_ staff/faculty_profiles/course 
materials/streib /juvdeath.pdf. 49 
 The vast majority of jurisdictions nationwide – 32 
States, the District of Columbia, and the federal gov-
ernment – have not sentenced a single child of either 
13 or 14 to life imprisonment without parole. Only 18 States have 13- or 14-year-old offenders serving life-
without-parole sentences.
60 Most of these jurisdictions 
that have imposed life-without-parole sentences on young adolescents have done so rarely: Only six 
States have more than two or three children serving 
such sentences.
61 
 Even this smattering of sentences can hardly be 
said to represent reasoned  judgments that lifetime 
imprisonment without parole was necessary or ap-
propriate for the individual juveniles involved. Ninety 
percent of these sentences were – like Kuntrell’s sentence – imposed under  mandatory sentencing 
statutes that prevented th e sentencer from consider-
ing these childrens’ young ages or other mitigating circumstances.
62 They do not reflect focused, factually 
 
 60 See Cruel and Unusual  at 20 (juveniles 14 or younger 
serving life without parole in 19 States: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi,  Nebraska, North Carolina, 
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, and Wis-consin). The current number is 18 States because California now 
has no people serving life without parole for offenses committed at 14 or younger. See Nu
ñez, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 259, cited supra  
note 53. 
 61 Cruel and Unusual  at 20. 
 62 Only eight of the approximately 79 sentences were im-
posed under discretionary sentenci ng schemes: two in Arkansas 
for first degree murder; one in Ar izona for first degree murder; 
(Continued on following page) 50 
informed efforts to attune  punishment to juvenile 
offenders’ particular degree of culpability, but rather 
automatic applications of statutory schemes which – 
as we have noted at pages 41-45 supra  – themselves 
bear no assurance of such an effort by Legislatures. 
And where sentencers are accorded  discretion to 
impose or withhold life-wi thout-parole sentences for 
young teens, such sentences are exceedingly rare: – 
fewer than a dozen nationwide. Another measure of 
the level and nature of public toleration of such sentences is the race of the people who get them. Of 
the approximately 79 people nationwide serving life-
without-parole sentences for offenses committed at ages 13 or 14, 70% are racial minorities.
63 
 The determination that life without parole is 
an excessive punishment for adolescent offenders is further confirmed by “the global consensus against the sentencing practice in question.” Graham , 130 
S. Ct. at 2033; see also  Roper , 543 U.S. at 575 (con-
sensus against sentence “finds confirmation in the stark reality that the United States is the only coun-try in the world that continues to give official sanc-tion” to this punishment). The United States stands 
alone in sentencing children to die in prison without hope of ever winning release.
64 No other country is 
 
two in Florida for attempted first degree and second degree 
murder; one in Illinois for first degree murder; one in Tennessee for first degree murder; and one in Wisconsin for first degree in-tentional homicide.

known to have any offend ers serving life-without-
parole sentences for crimes as children.65 Sentencing 
juveniles to life without parole is banned by interna-tional conventions signed by almost every member of the world community of nations. As Graham  noted, 
“the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3 (entered into force Sept. 2, 1990), ratified by every nation except the United States and Soma lia, prohibits the ‘imposi-
tion of life imprisonment without possibility of re-lease . . . for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age,’ ” 130 S. Ct. at 2034; and the United States was alone in opposing a resolution in 
the United Nations General Assembly calling on all states to abolish life sentences without parole for juveniles. The motion passed by a vote of 176 to 1.

 When the actual practice of imposing life-
without-parole sentences on young adolescents is 
examined, it amounts to a powerful demonstration 
of domestic and global unacceptability. Most juris- dictions in this Nation have had a chance to use life 
without parole extensively in the sentencing of ado-
lescents but have voted with their feet against this 
form of punishment. It is  shunned world-wide. What 
emerges is a solid consensus that the passing of 
irrevocable judgment on a child of 14, condemning him or her to be imprisoned  until death, is an intoler-
able aberration. 
 
F. There Is No Legal, Empirical, or Practical 
Justification for Disregarding in Homicide 
Cases the Findings of Roper  and Graham  
That Salient Differences Between Young 
Teens and Adults Bear Directly on the Ques-tion of Culpability Central to the Eighth 
Amendment Excessiveness Analysis.  
1. Young Teens Convicted of Homicide Are 
Indistinguishable from Those Convicted 
of Nonhomicide Offenses Under This Court’s Reasoning in Roper  and Graham .  
 None of the analytical considerations identified 
in Roper  and Graham  can rationally countenance 
a distinction between homicide and nonhomicide crimes. It cannot be said that children who commit 
homicides have any less “[d]ifficulty in weighing long-
term consequences” ( Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2032) or 
that they are any less likely  to make “impetuous and 53 
ill-considered actions and decisions” ( id. at 2028) than 
those who commit nonhomicides. Nor are the “parts 
of the brain involved in behavior control” ( id. at 2026) 
more mature in the case of a child who commits a homicide. Children involved in homicides do not have 
more “control, or experience with control, over their 
own environment” than other children, and they are no less “vulnerable or susceptible to negative influ-
ences and outside pressure s, including peer pres-
sure.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 569. 
 The character of a child who commits homicide 
is no less “transitory” ( id. at 570) and no more “well 
formed” ( Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026) than that of 
a juvenile nonhomicide offender. “The reality that 
juveniles still struggle to defi ne their identity means 
it is less supportable [than in the case of an adult] to 
conclude that even a hein ous crime committed by a 
juvenile is evidence of ir retrievably depraved charac-
ter.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 570. And it is no less challeng-
ing in homicide cases than in cases of other violent 
crimes to accurately “distinguish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the ca-
pacity for change.” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2032.  
 Roper  recognized that juven iles as a class differ 
from adults in every one of  these dimensions, even in 
the case of aggravated homicides. And for young adolescents like Kuntrell, the class-wide differences 
from adults in capability and culpability are even 
greater. Regarding this subclass of younger teens, the infrequency with which they have been sentenced to 
life without parole during recent decades of “[a]ctual 54 
sentencing practices” ( Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2023) is 
as striking as that in Graham  and Roper . 
 
2. The “Super-Predator” Is An Exploded 
Myth That Cannot Justify Sentencing Young Teens to Life Without Parole.  
 Homicides by young adolescents do not constitute 
a danger of such magnit ude as to warrant their 
exclusion from the constitutional logic of Roper  and 
Graham . Although the 79 children 14 and younger 
who have been sentenced to life without parole for 
homicides represent only a minuscule percentage of 
children that age arrested for homicides, the total number of young adolescents arrested for homicide 
also represents only a tiny fraction of the total num-
ber of homicide arrests every year.
67 
 In the 1990s, fears of a massive increase in 
violent juvenile crime stimulated many of the legal changes that removed young adolescents from juve-
nile courts and exposed them to sentences of life 
without parole. Some influential criminologists issued predictions of a coming wa ve of “super-predators” 
with whom the juvenile justice system would be 
 
 67 For example, in 2010 the Uniform Crime Reports indicate 
that out of 8667 people arrested for murder or non-negligent homicide, only 73 (0.8%) were 14 or younger. See U.S. Dep’t of 
Justice, Fed. Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports for the United States, Table 38 (2010), available at  http://www. 
fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in- the-u.s./2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/ 
tables/10tbl38.xls. 55 
unable to cope.68 These theorists suggested that we 
would soon see “elementary school youngsters who 
pack guns instead of lunches” and who “have abso-
lutely no respect for human life.”69 Panic over the 
impending crime wave expected from these “radically 
impulsive, brutally remorseless”70 children led nearly 
every State to enact legislation increasing the expo-sure of children to adult prosecution.
71 
 
 68 “Super-predator” language was commonly used in con-
junction with dire predictions that a vast increase in violent juvenile crime was occurri ng or about to occur. See, e.g.,  Sacha 
Coupet, What to Do With the Sheep in Wolf ’s Clothing: The Role 
of Rhetoric and Reality About Youth Offenders in the Construc-tive Dismantling of the Juvenile Justice System , 148 U. Pa. L. 
Rev. 1303, 1307 (2000); Laura A. Bazelon, Note: Exploding the 
Superpredator Myth: Why Infancy is the Preadolescent’s Best Defense in Juvenile Court , 75 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 159 (2000). Much of 
the frightening imagery was racially coded. See, e.g.,  John J. 
DiIulio, Jr., My Black Crime Problem, and Ours , City Journal 
(1996), http://www.city-journal.or g/html/6_2_my_black.html (warn-
ing about “270,000 more young predators on the streets than in 1990, coming at us in waves over the next two decades . . . as many as half of these juvenile super-predators could be young black males”); William J. Bennett, John J. DiIulio, Jr., & John P. 
Walters, Body Count: Moral Poverty – And How to Win America’s 
War Against Crime and Drugs  27-28 (1996) [hereinafter Body 
Count ].

 In the last decade, those predictions have proved 
wildly inaccurate.72 Lower rates of juvenile crime 
from 1994 to 2000 despite si multaneous increases in 
the juvenile population led academics who had origi-nally supported the “super-predator” theory to back 
away from their predictions.
73 In 2001, the Surgeon 
General of the United States released a report label-ing the “super-predator” theory a myth and stating 
that “[t]here is no evidence that young people in-
volved in violence during th e peak years of the early 
1990s were more frequent or more vicious offenders 
than youths in earlier years.”
74 
 Even during the height of the violent crime wave 
of the early 1990s, when homicide arrests did tempo-
rarily increase for older teens and young adults, homicides by children 14 and younger remained a

very small part of the problem.75 Thus, there is no 
pragmatic justification fo r abandoning or cutting 
back all of the teachings of Roper  and Graham  in 
order to make constitutional space for lifelong incar-ceration of a few 14-year-olds convicted of murder.  
 
3. Principled, Practical Procedures Are Avail-
able to Assure Against Improvident Re-lease of Young Teens Imprisoned for 
Homicide.  
 Graham  forbids juvenile sentences that provide 
“no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance for reconciliation with society, no hope.” 130 
S. Ct. at 2032. Its aim is to secure for children “some 
meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” Id. at 
2030. 
 Many States have procedures suitable for pro-
viding a “meaningful opportunity to obtain release” 
by encouraging incarcerated children to work “to achieve maturity of judgment.” Id. at 2032. Alabama 
begins considering release for parole-eligible life-term 
 
 75 The 1992 UCR figures, for example, show 19,491 people 
arrested for murder or non-negligent homicide, but only 304 (1.6%) who were 14 or younger. See U . S .  D ep ’ t  o f  J u s t ic e,  F e d . 
Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports for the United States, at 227 (1992); see also U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Bureau of 
Justice Statistics, Homicide Trends 1980-2008 , 4 (2011), avail-
able at  http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf (show-
ing trends in homicide arrests by age from 1980 to 2008). 58 
inmates after 15 years and subsequently conducts 
periodic review of prisoners not yet deemed ready to 
return to society. See Ala. Board of Pardons and 
Paroles, Rules, Regulations, and Procedures, Art. 1(8). Louisiana requires that any 14-year-old tried as 
an adult be released by age 31. See La. Child. Code 
Ann. art. 857(B). Provisions of this sort balance the need for punishment with the need to provide hope 
and incentive for improvement.  
 They also respect Graham ’s and Roper ’s recog-
nition of the salient characteristics of youth, particu-
larly children’s innate “capacity for change,” Graham , 
130 S. Ct. at 2030. They respect Graham ’s insight 
that “[a] young person who knows that he or she has 
no chance to leave prison before life’s end has little incentive to become a responsible individual.” Id. at 
2032. They can be used to assure an opportunity for 
release which is not so far beyond the time horizon of a teen that it fails to provide an incentive for reform 
or so close to death that it denies a reformed teen 
the chance to contribute to the society to which he or she returns. They refute the bleak, destructive, self-
fulfilling prophesy that “the system itself . . . [must 
become] complicit in the lack of development” of incarcerated children by “withhold[ing] counseling, 
education, and rehabilitation programs” ( id. at 2032-
33) that can foster “self-recognition of human worth and potential” ( id. at 2032). 
 “A State is not required to guarantee even- 
tual freedom to a juvenile offender.” Id. at 2030. For 
young teens convicted of homicide, no less than for 59 
those convicted of lesser crimes, the States can keep 
the promise of Graham  through any sentencing or 
post-sentence review procedure that provides a “mean-
ingful opportunity to obtain release based on demon-strated maturity and rehabilitation,” id. 
 
G. Appropriate Categorical Lines Can Readily 
Be Drawn.  
 Roper  and Graham  both recognized that, given 
the “dilemma of juvenile sentencing,” Graham , 130 
S. Ct. at 2032, a categori cal rule, while “imperfect,” 
was necessary. Id. at 2030; Roper , 543 U.S. at 572. 
“[A]llowing the imposition of these sentences based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a 
judge or jury that the offender is irredeemably de-
praved” is “insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life without parole sen-
tence for which he or she lacks the moral culpability.” 
Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2031. And “even if we were to 
assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders 
might have ‘sufficient psychological maturity, and at 
the same time demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,’ . . . to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not 
follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportion-
ality approach could with sufficient accuracy distin-guish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the 
many that have the capacity for change.” Id. at 2032 60 
(citation omitted).76 Given the inescapable difficulty of 
reliably predicting a child’s character development 
years into the future,77 a categorical rule barring the 
infliction of a life-without-parole sentence on any offender under a certain age is necessary. The ques-
tion is not whether to draw a category boundary but 
where to draw it.
78  
 This is, of course, familiar terrain for the Court. 
“The case-by-case approach to sentencing must . . . be confined by some boundaries.” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 
2031-32. A well-established pr ocess for locating the 
boundary line through consideration of “objective indicia of society’s standards,” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 
2022, and “the exercise of [the Court’s] own inde-
pendent judgment,” id., is fully adequate to the task. 
 
 76 In homicide cases particularly, an “unacceptable likeli-
hood exists that the brutality or cold-blooded nature of any par-ticular crime would overpower mi tigating arguments based on 
youth as a matter of course, even  where the juvenile offender’s 
objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity” should require consideration. Roper , 543 U.S. at 573. 
 
77 “[T]he features that distinguish juveniles from adults also 
put them at a significant disadv antage in criminal proceedings.” 
Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2032. “Difficulty in weighing long-term 
consequences; a corresponding impu lsiveness; and reluctance to 
trust defense counsel . . . all can lead to poor decisions by one 
charged with a juvenile offense.” Id. These problems heighten 
the risk that, under a case-by-case approach, a court or jury will misjudge a particular child’s cul pability and amenability to re-
form.  
 
78 Despite “the objections always  raised against categorical 
rules . . . , a line must be drawn.” Roper , 543 U.S. at 574.  61 
 The Court could discern a satisfactory basis for 
drawing the line at any one of several different ages. 
To a considerable extent, the vulnerabilities and 
limitations of adolescence are common to a 14-year-old like Kuntrell Jackson and to a 17-year-old. For 
that reason, and because of the widespread recogni-
tion that full adult responsibilities requiring maturity of judgment should be withheld from adolescents 
below the age of 18 ( see, e.g. , Roper , 543 U.S. at 579, 
Appendices B-D), the line co uld properly be drawn at 
18. 
 However, as the scientific data we have summa-
rized at pages 16-27 supra  and the common-sense 
observations of parents world-wide attest, 13- and 14-
year-olds as a class are much less mature than 17-year-olds.
79 Numerous State statutes recognize this 
plain fact of life by provi ding special protections for 
children of 13 and 14 and by restricting their free-doms in ways that are thought unnecessary in the 
case of older teenagers. See supra  pp. 29-34. An 
additional – indeed, independently sufficient – basis for drawing the line between 14 and 15 would be the 
indisputable numerical evidence of repudiation of 
sentences of life imprisonme nt without the possibility 
of parole for 13- and 14-year-olds: a nationwide total 
of only approximately 79 such sentences having 
accumulated over the past 40 years. See supra  pp. 47-50. 
 
 79 See, e.g.,  Steinberg, Graham, et al., Future Orientation , 
supra  note 28, at 39; Steinberg & Monahan, supra  note 28, at 
1538-41; Steinberg, Cauffman, et al., supra  note 5, at 1776. 62 
While we do not have access to precise data regarding 
the comparable figure for older adolescents, the 
available indications are t hat the numbers rise sharp-
ly from age 15 upwards.80  
 There is also justification for drawing the line 
between 15 and 16. Many State statutes group 15-year-olds with 13- and 14- year-olds for purposes of 
the special protections and restrictions that they 
prescribe for younger teens but not older ones. And in 
the ordinary course of adolescent development, the 
growth of some capabilities that are crucial for ma-
ture judgment appears to level off at 16. See, e.g., 
Laurence Steinberg, Elizabeth Cauffman, et al., Age 
Differences in Sensation-Seeking and Impulsivity as 
Indexed by Behavior and Self-Report: Evidence for a 
Dual Systems Model , 44 Dev. Psychol. 1764, 1771 
(2008) (“[S]ensation seeking increases during the first 
half of adolescence and then declines steadily from age 16 on.”); id. at 1774 (“[H]eighten ed sensation seek-
ing is most clearly and consistently seen among in-
dividuals between the ages of 12 and 15.”); Laurence 
 
 80 As of 2008, Human Rights Watch estimated there were 
2484 offenders serving juvenile li fe-without-parole sentences in 
the United States. Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their 
Lives: Life without Parole for Youth Offenders in the United States in 2008  (May 2008), http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/ 
reports/us1005execsum.pdf. Human Rights Watch previously es-
timated that 13.3% of these children were 15 years old at the time of their offense. See Amnesty Int’l & Human Rights Watch, 
Rest of Their Lives: Life without Parole for Youth Offenders in the United States  26 (Oct. 11, 2005), http://www.hrw.org/en/ 
reports/2005/10/11/rest-their-lives. 63 
Steinberg, Adolescent Develo pment and Juvenile 
Justice , 5 Ann. Rev. Clinical Psychol. 47, 55 (2009). 
 But wherever the line is  drawn, there is no 
defensible constitutional logic consistent with Roper  
and Graham  that allows a State to condemn a 14-
year-old child to “die in prison without any mean-ingful opportunity to obtain release, no matter what 
he might do to demonstrate that the bad acts he 
committed as a teenager are not representative of his true character, even if he spends the next half 
century attempting to atone for his crimes and learn 
from his mistakes,” Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2033. 
 
H. The Constitutional Rule of Graham  Would 
Be Stripped of Intelligible Meaning If It 
Were Held Inapplicable  to the Mandatory 
Life-Without-Parole Se ntence Imposed on 
14-Year-Old Kuntrell Jackson for a Homicide 
Crime Attributed to Him Through Accesso-rial Felony-Murder Doctrines.  
 As the dissent below found , it is difficult to dis-
tinguish Kuntrell Jackson’s level of personal culpabil-
ity from Terrance Graham’s. J.A. 85 (“The facts in 
Graham  are not terribly different from the facts in 
the instant case, except that the victim in Graham  
did not die from Graham’s accomplice’s physical attack.”). Both young men engaged in a robbery with 
other teens, and, in both  cases, an accomplice at-
tacked the robbery victim. J. A. 84-86. Indeed, if case-
specific distinctions were to be drawn, convincing 
reasons could be found to regard Kuntrell Jackson’s 64 
culpability as less than Terrance Graham’s. Kuntrell 
was barely 14 years old; he became aware of an older 
companion’s possession of a gun only shortly before 
his companions entered the shop where the robbery was committed; he himself initially chose to remain 
outside the shop ( Jackson , 194 S.W.3d at 758-59); and 
the circumstances strongly  suggest that his compan-
ion’s firing of the gun was unexpected: the startled 
trio ran away without taking any money; Kuntrell’s 
felony-murder conviction was not obtained on the theory that he intended any assault upon the victim;
81 
and the conviction was affirmed on the express 
ground that the evidence was not insufficient solely because the jury could have resolved the “question of 
fact as to whether Jackson said ‘We ain’t playin’ ’ or ‘I 
thought you all was playin’ ’ upon entering the store” (id. at 760) in such a way as to support a conclusion 
that “Jackson did, in fact, in some way solicit, com-
mand, induce, procure, counsel, or aid in the commis-sion of the crime sub judice ” (id.). 
 Graham  observed that “a juvenile offender who 
did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished 
moral culpability.” 130 S. Ct. at 2027. To be sure, from 
the standpoint of the harm caused, even unintended 
 
 81 “In order to convict the appellant of capital murder, the 
State had to prove that Jackson attempted to commit or commit-ted an aggravated robbery and, in the course of that offense, he, or an accomplice, caused Ms. Troup’s death under circumstance 
manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life.” 194 S.W.3d at 760 (emphasis added). 65 
felony murder is a more serious crime than the 
nonhomicide offenses on which it is predicated. This 
is undeniable and explains wh y it is traditionally and 
legitimately punished more severely. But the applica-tion of felony-murder liability to young children 
becomes problematic in the light of the differences 
between children and adults recognized in Roper  and 
Graham . 
 The felony-murder doctrine rests essentially on 
the idea that one who chooses to become involved in a 
potentially violent felony should reasonably antic-
ipate injury to victims or bystanders. See Tison v. 
Arizona , 481 U.S. 137, 159-60 (1987) (Brennan, J., 
dissenting). As Graham  implicitly recognizes, this 
rationale is attenuated in the case of juveniles. Juve-niles as a group, and especially young adolescents 
like Kuntrell, have a significantly impaired ability 
to anticipate future consequences.
82 For this reason, 
they are less able to recognize that their participation 
in a robbery may lead to someone’s injury or death. 
Moreover, juveniles’ poor impulse control and high susceptibility to peer influence inhibit their ability to 
withdraw from potentially deadly situations when 
they are encouraged into wrongdoing by others. See 
Graham , 130 S. Ct. at 2026. In short, Kuntrell’s in-
carceration for life with no possibility of parole cannot 
be reconciled with Graham ’s square holding through 
 
 82 See the authorities in note 22 supra . 66 
any logic that takes this Court’s reasoning in Graham  
and Roper  at all seriously.
