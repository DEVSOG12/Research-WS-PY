His presence in the Witness Against Torture community was deeply cherished, and his absence will be hard to accept. Sending love to Judy and all the family.”Lastly, make sure to save the date for our annual Fast for Justice: January 3-12 and our presence at the Presidential Inauguration January 19-21 – We will start planning for these events soon.
