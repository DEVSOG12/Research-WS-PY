Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, responded to Ms. Haspel's moral confusion by saying:"Ms. Haspel argued that the program was legal, she suggested that Congress had adopted the Army Field Manual as a 'stricter' moral standard, and she even suggested that waterboarding was inhumane if done by a terrorist but not if done by the CIA. She was never, though, able to say that waterboarding or any other act of torture was immoral. Ms. Haspel has conflated law with morality and seems to have a moral compass that is spinning in circles. Being unable to say that torture is immoral shows that she lacks the character necessary to stand up to the President and be an independent, moral CIA Director."Faith groups representing Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faith communities recently delivered letters to all Senators expressing opposition to the Haspel nomination:http://www.nrcat.org/ncc-letter-haspel-nominationhttp://www.nrcat.org/catholic-letter-on-haspel-nominationhttp://www.nrcat.org/truah-letter-haspel-nominationThe National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
