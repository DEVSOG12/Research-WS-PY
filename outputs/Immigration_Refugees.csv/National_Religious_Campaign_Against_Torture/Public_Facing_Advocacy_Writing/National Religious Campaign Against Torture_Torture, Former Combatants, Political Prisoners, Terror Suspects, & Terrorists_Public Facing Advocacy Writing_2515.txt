The letter to the Attorney General follows recent media reports published by NPR and The Marshall Project uncovering allegations of torture at USP Lewisburg, including the use of prolonged double-celled solitary confinement, restraints, and lack of mental health treatment. The letter states that these reports “mirror years of troubling complaints at this federal facility,” and calls for “greater oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure humane and lawful conditions of confinement.”Rev. Laura Markle Downton, NRCAT’s Director of U.S. Prisons Policy and Program, stated, “Prolonged isolated confinement has been defined as torture by the United Nations and is widely opposed by medical and mental health professionals and leading corrections officials. The National Religious Campaign Against Torture has mobilized people of faith to oppose solitary confinement for many years. With bipartisan momentum building at the state-level for humane alternatives to restrictive housing, reported conditions at USP Lewisburg call for swift intervention and accountability.”The full letter delivered to the Department of Justice today follows:***November 28, 2016Attorney General Loretta E. LynchU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20530-0001Dear Madam Attorney General Lynch,As representatives of civil and human rights organizations, mental health and religious organizations, we write to urge you to request the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General launch an investigation into the federal Bureau of Prisons practices at the Lewisburg federal penitentiary, including the use of double-celled solitary confinement, restraints, and lack of mental health treatment.Recent media reports published by NPR and The Marshall Project have uncovered harrowing allegations of abuse and torture at USP Lewisburg.[1] These investigative reports mirror years of troubling complaints at this federal facility where incarcerated people have stated that they are routinely forced to face double-celled solitary confinement in a 6×10 ft cell for nearly 24 hours a day with a potentially dangerous or mentally unstable cell mate. Others, who refuse a cell assignment because they fear the individual who will be locked down with them, report being shackled in painful restraints for hours and even days at a time as punishment for refusing dangerous housing.Since 2009, at least four incarcerated people at Lewisburg have been killed by their cellmates, and the rate of assault there is six times higher than federal prisons overall. Media reports reveal officers responded to roughly 300 fights with cuffs and pepper spray. Incarcerated people have suffered from injuries including broken ribs and stab wounds: such evidence of profound and systemic use of devices of torture call for investigation and intervention.[2] By any measure, this is a facility in crisis that requires greater oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure humane and lawful conditions of confinement.We applaud your tremendous leadership in addressing the use of restrictive housing in United States prisons and urge swift action in response to these disturbing reports.Sincerely,African American Ministers In Action (AAMIA)American Civil Liberties UnionAmerican Friends Service CommitteeBaptist Peace Fellowship of North AmericaBend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for JusticeCampaign for Alternatives to Isolated Confinement (CAIC)Center for Children's Law and PolicyCommunion of Synodal Catholic ChurchesDisciples Center for Public WitnessEcumenical Catholic CommunionExodus Foundation.orgFig Tree RevolutionFirst Congregational Church of East Hartford, United Church of ChristFranciscan Action NetworkHealing Communities USAHuman Rights Defense CenterHuman Rights WatchInterfaith Action for Human RightsLewisburg Prison ProjectNAMI NYSNational Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good ShepherdNational Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)National Association of Social WorkersNational Center for Lesbian RightsNational Council of ChurchesNational Council of Jewish WomenNational Religious Campaign Against TortureNETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social JusticePennsylvania Institutional Law ProjectSolitary GardensSouthern Poverty Law CenterT'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human RightsUnitarian Universalist AssociationUnited Church of Christ, Justice and Witness MinistriesThe United Methodist Church - General Board of Church and SocietyUptown People's Law CenterWestern New York Peace Centercc: Michael E.
