Folks, it’s not a pretty picture.This bipartisan committee, The Constitution Project’s Task Force on Detainee Treatment, brought in some big guns — including President George W. Bush’s undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, former Republican Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, and President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to Mexico, James Jones, who served as a Democratic member of Congress from Oklahoma — to lead the group. Their research into the treatment of 9/11 detainees included public records as well as eyewitness accounts. What they found sickens me both as an U.S. citizen and as a Christian.People are also reading…Historic Madison building, Lawson family murders, featured in Netflix series, '28 Days Haunted''Unacceptable': Like nation, North Carolina students drop to new lows on national testsLawson family murders, historic Madison building featured in Netflix series "28 Days Haunted"Lawson family murders, historic Madison building featured in Netflix series "28 Days Haunted"Toyota NC signs sublease for Greensboro operational facilityGreensboro police used tear gas, pepper spray to disperse large crowd gathered at The Province Apartments early TuesdayGreensboro man charged with murder in Virginia woman's deathFormer longtime assistant DA appointed Guilford County Superior Court judgeTriad hospitals cope with barrage of child respiratory casesNC A&T freshman mourned after shooting late Tuesday in Greensboro kills 2, injures 4Guilford superintendent supports changes to school performance grading systemHomicide victim identified by Greensboro policeFormer nurse charged with murder of two patients, attempted murder of a third at Winston-Salem hospitalMan found unresponsive in Guilford jail cell has died, sheriff's office saysWinston-Salem diner has 1 employee – the owner – keeping iconic eatery open through a shutdown, a labor shortage and more.Our great nation stooped to depths previously condemned as illegal, including waterboarding, extended sleep deprivation, prolonged solitary confinement and sexual humiliation. Worse yet, detainees were literally tortured to death.I don’t know about you, but for me, that is no light on a hill. It is certainly not the behavior of one of the world’s greatest nations. It sounds more like the behavior we expect from groups that practice guerrilla warfare or nations that sanction military dictatorships.It certainly doesn’t sound American, and as a minister, I’d also point out it’s far removed from anything we see in the teachings and life of Jesus.There are those who make an appeal to nationalism and the tragedy of 9/11 and are willing to toss our moral high ground aside, saying that anything is fair game if it leads to valuable information.This is why we need access to the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report, which was adopted in December and has yet to see the public light of day. You see, the bipartisan committee found “no firm or persuasive evidence that the (the use of torture) produced significant information of value.” The task force did find that “there is substantial evidence that much of the information adduced from (torture) was not useful or reliable.”It’s essential for the public to have access to the information in the Senate’s report if we are going to keep the U.S. government accountable to the people. Otherwise, we end up with exactly what we seem to have before us, justification of illegal, immoral behavior through false manipulation of the law, all in the name of a nation that should stand above that kind of behavior.There are those, however, who would block our access to this incredibly important information. North Carolina’s Sen. Richard Burr, who sits on the committee that approved the report, opposes making it public. He claims he opposes the release because it contains inaccurate facts.If it actually is inaccurate, there is an easy solution — particularly for someone like Burr who sits on the Intelligence Committee: Fix it and release the right information to the public.As a citizen, I join people of faith from hundreds of diverse religious and faith-based groups who have come together through the National Religious Campaign Against Torture to call on the Senate Intelligence Committee to release its report about U.S.-sponsored torture to the American people.As a Presbyterian minister, I denounce all torture, especially state-sanctioned torture. All people of faith should have a crystal clear position against it as well. After all, it was state-sanctioned torture that killed an innocent man some 2,000 years ago on a cross. I fear we are repeating history.Let us once again hold the leaders of our nation — and our state — accountable for their actions. Let us call them to be, once again, a nation of the just — we have sacrificed far too many of our moral standards already. Let us once again establish the United States as a nation that values life, not destroys it.Let us prove to the world that we do not have to stoop to the levels of the lowest forms of violence to resolve our problems. Let us, once again, establish our place on the hill, and shine the light of truth and justice for all to see.The Rev.
