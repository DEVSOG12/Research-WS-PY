The National Religious Campaign Against Torture along with countless national and international human rights organizations had called for Mr. Woodfox's release for many years, today Rev. Ron Stief, executive director of NRCAT released the following statement:"The National Religious Campaign Against Torture celebrates that after more than 43 years in solitary confinement, Mr. Albert Woodfox will finally be released from prison. Many U.S. faith leaders have stood with the international community pushing for decades for his release and an end to the immoral torture of his prolonged isolation."Tragically most do not leave solitary confinement with this level of support or attention. As we witness this remarkable development, we remember that each year in the United States, thousands of people are released directly from prolonged solitary confinement to our communities with no means of grappling with the psychological, social and physical trauma this immoral treatment has caused."With this news, faith communities nationwide recommit to standing for human rights and calling for the United States to embrace the moral courage to end the practice of long-term solitary confinement."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
