Ron Stief, executive director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, which advocates for an end to all government-sponsored torture, released this statement:"This case shows that U.S. torture isn't just limited to Guantanamo or CIA black sites. Torture can, and does, happen in the custody of police. The city of Chicago has set an example for the nation by prosecuting the torturer, promising an apology, and giving financial compensation – all key elements of healing the scars left by torture on its victims. Lawmakers, policymakers and prosecutors at all levels of U.S. government should take note."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org     @NRCATtweets     facebook.com/nrcat###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
