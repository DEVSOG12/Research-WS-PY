Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released this statement today in response to the book:“As National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice chaired meetings ofPresident George W. Bush’s Principals Committee, which approved, andeven helped design, interrogation sessions that incorporated acts oftorture including waterboarding, yet she never even mentions the word‘torture’ in her entire book.  We do not know if she does not understandthat what she approved of was torture, or if she simply does not thinkthat U.S. sponsorship of torture is important enough to be worth hercontinued attention, but either way she is wrong.  We look forward toadditional attention from the media, asking her to address this glaringomission and prompting her to discuss her current thoughts abouttorture.People of faith know that torture is wrong; lawyers know that it’sillegal; and soldiers know it doesn’t work.  It’s time for policymakers –even former policymakers such as Condoleezza Rice – to listen to peoplewho know better, and to admit the mistakes they made when they gavetheir seal of approval to the use of torture.”///HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
