Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released the following statement about the report:“North Carolinians have shown us what can be accomplished by a group of citizens who dedicate themselves to investigating an unjust and illegal government program. While other reports have described the CIA’s torture flights, this report lays bare the raw inhumanity of Aero Contractor’s work to shuffle individuals between nations and facilities where they were tortured, as well as the degree of local government complicity in a federal government crime.As people of faith, members of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture know that torture is always wrong. It is against all of our faiths, and it is against the better values of our great country. Every aspect of the CIA’s torture program was wrong – from the torture carried out by CIA operatives, to the Aero Contractor flights used to send people off to be tortured by foreign governments. I encourage people to read the report and then to contact their local and federal officials about the importance of preventing anything like this from every happening again.”The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
