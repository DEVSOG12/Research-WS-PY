The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) has mobilized people of faith across the country to oppose solitary confinement, and has specifically led efforts to ban the solitary confinement for juveniles in California and other jurisdictions. Following the introduction of this historic legislation today, Rev. Ron Stief, executive director of NRCAT released this statement:"Many members of Congress appear ready to admit that it is immoral and counterproductive to put kids in solitary confinement. With this bill, Congress is taking the lead in recognizing the psychological and spiritual pain inflicted by solitary confinement. Our society must no longer subject children to the torture of solitary confinement – a practice that has proven ineffective, costly, and profoundly counterproductive for any goals of rehabilitation in our prisons. In particular, this bill would resolve a huge injustice for our kids here in the District of Columbia, many of whom are in the custody of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons after conviction and are far too often held in solitary confinement. The inherent worth and dignity of every human being means that we do not abandon our children ever, especially behind the closed doors of U.S. prisons."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
