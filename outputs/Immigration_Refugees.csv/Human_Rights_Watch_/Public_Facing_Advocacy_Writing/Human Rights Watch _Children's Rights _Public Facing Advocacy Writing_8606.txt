Under the McKinney-Vento Act, each state and every school district has designated staff responsible for ensuring the identification and enrollment of homeless students. This structure has enabled many school districts to enroll displaced children quickly and smoothly.We are deeply concerned that a waiver to the McKinney-Vento Act could have very negative and far-reaching consequences. Although intended to provide school districts with flexibility in responding to large numbers of evacuees, such a waiver could seriously undermine children’s access to education without discrimination.In particular, we are concerned that waivers to the McKinney-Vento Act may allow some school districts to turn children away, denying them their right to education entirely, or to segregate them into separate schools. As you know, the McKinney-Vento Act specifically prohibits states receiving assistance under the act from segregating homeless children in separate schools, separate programs within schools, or separate settings within schools.Schools could use the waiver system to avoid serving some students, based on socio-economic status, housing status, special needs, or race, or to segregate displaced students from the general school population. Our concerns regarding potential discrimination resulting from a waiver are particularly acute given thedisproportionate number of African-American children and children from lower economic status that have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina. At this time, it is more important than ever to maintain existing protections in our legal framework that ensure children’s access to education without discrimination.We also believe that it is in the best interests of the child to be integrated as quickly as possible into existing schools with established educational programs. For children who have been through trauma such as a natural disaster or displacement from their homes, being integrated into established classrooms with students who have not gone through such trauma can help re-establish a sense of stability and normalcy.Maintaining the provisions of the McKinney-Vento Act, as we have already seen during the initial response to the needs of evacuees, will be essential to ensuring that hundreds of thousands of children have immediate access to education without discrimination, and are able to integrate into stable and positive classroom environments. Rather than seek a waiver to this important piece of legislation, we urge you to uphold these provisions.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely yours,Lois WhitmanExecutive DirectorChildren’s Rights DivisionJamie FellnerExecutive DirectorU.S. ProgramYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's RightsMore ReadingSeptember 21, 2005News ReleaseNew Orleans: Prisoners Abandoned to FloodwatersReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingSeptember 21, 2005News ReleaseNew Orleans: Prisoners Abandoned to FloodwatersMost ViewedOctober 27, 2022ReportMali: Coordinated Massacres by Islamist Armed GroupsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceShare this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
