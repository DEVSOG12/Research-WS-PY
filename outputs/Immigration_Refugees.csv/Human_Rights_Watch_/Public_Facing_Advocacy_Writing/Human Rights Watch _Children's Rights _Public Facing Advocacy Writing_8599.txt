No other country imposes juvenile life without parole for any crime, including homicide. The United States remains an egregious outlier.Our research indicates that there are well over a thousand youth offenders who will spend the rest of their lives in prison for committing homicide in the United States.The court's analysis points the way forward: it explains that youth are categorically "less culpable" than adults, and it requires states to give youth "meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation."Bills are pending around the country to do precisely that. Until they pass and all juvenile offenders receive opportunities for parole, the United States will remain out of step with the rest of the world.Alison ParkerDirector, U.S. ProgramHuman Rights WatchSan Francisco, May 18, 2010Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal JusticeTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingOctober 2, 2009Fact SheetState Distribution of Youth Offenders Serving Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP)May 17, 2010News ReleaseCalifornia: Pass Law to Review Youth SentencesReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingOctober 2, 2009Fact SheetState Distribution of Youth Offenders Serving Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP)May 17, 2010News ReleaseCalifornia: Pass Law to Review Youth SentencesMost ViewedOctober 27, 2022ReportMali: Coordinated Massacres by Islamist Armed GroupsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceShare this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
