The routes shown are based onHuman Rights Watch’s interviews with talibés, marabouts, parents,and humanitarian and government officials in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau; a 2007quantitative study of begging children in Dakar performed by the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF), the International Labour Organization, and the WorldBank; and detailed records kept by SOS Talibé Children (SOS CriançasTalibés) of children returned to Guinea-Bissau after running away fromdaaras in Senegal.SummaryI have to bring money, rice, and sugar each day. When Ican’t bring everything, the marabout beats me. He beats me other timestoo, even when I do bring the sum.... I want to stop this, but I can’t. Ican’t leave, I have nowhere to go.–Modou S., 12-year-old talibé in Saint-LouisThe teachings of Islam are completely contrary tosending children on the street and forcing them to beg.... Certain maraboutshave ignored this—they love the comfort, the money they receive fromliving off the backs of the children.–Aliou Seydi, marabout in KoldaAt least 50,000 children attending hundreds of residentialQuranic schools, or daaras, in Senegal are subjected to conditions akin toslavery and forced to endure often extreme forms of abuse, neglect, andexploitation by the teachers, or marabouts, who serve as their de factoguardians. By no means do all Quranic schools run such regimes, but many maraboutsforce the children, known as talibés, to beg on the streets for longhours—a practice that meets the International Labour Organization’s(ILO) definition of a worst form of child labor—and subject them to oftenbrutal physical and psychological abuse. The marabouts are also grosslynegligent in fulfilling the children’s basic needs, including food,shelter, and healthcare, despite adequate resources in most urban daaras,brought in primarily by the children themselves.In hundreds of urban daaras in Senegal, it is the childrenwho provide for the marabout. While talibés live in completedeprivation, marabouts in many daaras demand considerable daily sums fromdozens of children in their care, through which some marabouts enjoy relativeaffluence. In thousands of cases where the marabout transports or receivestalibés for the purpose of exploitation, the child is also a victim oftrafficking.The Senegalese and Bissau-Guinean governments, Islamicauthorities under whose auspices the schools allegedly operate, and parentshave all failed miserably to protect tens of thousands of these children fromabuse, and have not made any significant effort to hold the perpetratorsaccountable. Conditions in the daaras, including the treatment of childrenwithin them, remain essentially unregulated by the authorities.Well-intentioned aid agencies attempting to fill the protection gap have toooften emboldened the perpetrators by giving aid directly to the marabouts whoabuse talibés, insufficiently monitoring the impact or use of such aid,and failing to report abuse.Moved from their villages in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau tocities in Senegal, talibés are forced to beg for up to 10 hours a day.Morning to night, the landscape of Senegal’s cities is dotted with thesight of the boys—the vast majority under 12 years old and many as youngas four—shuffling in small groups through the streets; weaving in and outof traffic; and waiting outside shopping centers, marketplaces, banks, andrestaurants. Dressed in filthy, torn, and oversized shirts, and often barefoot,they hold out a small plastic bowl or empty can hoping for alms. On the streetthey are exposed to disease, the risk of injury or death from car accidents,and physical and sometimes sexual abuse by adults.In a typical urban daara, the teacher requires histalibés to bring a sum of money, rice, and sugar every day, but little ofthis benefits the children. Many children are terrified about what will happento them if they fail to meet the quota, for the punishment—physical abusemeted out by the marabout or his assistant—is generally swift and severe,involving beatings with electric cable, a club, or a cane. Some are bound orchained while beaten, or are forced into stress positions. Those captured aftera failed attempt to run away suffer the most severe abuse. Weeks or monthsafter having escaped the daara, some 20 boys showed Human Rights Watch scarsand welts on their backs that were left by a teacher’s beatings.Daily life for these children is one of extreme deprivation.Despite bringing money and rice to the daara, the children are forced to begfor their meals on the street. Some steal or dig through trash in order to findsomething to eat. The majority suffer from constant hunger and mild to severemalnutrition. When a child falls ill, which happens often with long hours onthe street and poor sanitary conditions in the daara, the teacher seldom offershealthcare assistance. The children are forced to spend even longer begging to purchasemedicines to treat the stomach parasites, malaria, and skin diseases that runrampant through the daaras. Most of the urban daaras are situated in abandoned,partially constructed structures or makeshift thatched compounds. The childrenroutinely sleep 30 to a small room, crammed so tight that, particularly duringthe hot season, they choose to brave the elements outside. During Senegal’sfour-month winter, the talibés suffer the cold with little or no cover,and, in some cases, even a mat to sleep on.Many marabouts leave their daara for weeks at a time toreturn to their villages or to recruit more children, placing talibés asyoung as four in the care of teenage assistants who often brutalize theyoungest and sometimes subject them to sexual abuse.In hundreds of urban daaras, the marabouts appear toprioritize forced begging over Quranic learning. With their days generally consumedwith required activity from the pre-dawn prayer until late into the evening,the talibés rarely have time to access forms of education that wouldequip them with basic skills, or for normal childhood activities andrecreation, including the otherwise ubiquitous game of football. In some cases,they are even beaten for taking time to play, by marabouts who see it as adistraction from begging.Marabouts who exploit children make little to no effort tofacilitate even periodic contact between the talibés and their parents.The proliferation of mobile phones and network coverage into even the mostisolated villages in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau should make contact easy, but thevast majority of talibés never speak with their families. In many cases,preventing contact appears to be a strategy employed by the marabout.Unfed by the marabout, untreated when sick, forced to workfor long hours only to turn over money and rice to someone who uses almost noneof it for their benefit—and then beaten whenever they fail to reach thequota—hundreds, likely thousands, of talibés run away from daaraseach year. Many talibés plan their escape, knowing the exact location ofrunaway shelters. Others choose life on the streets over the conditions in thedaara. As a result, a defining legacy of the present-day urban daara is thegrowing problem of street children, who are thrust into a life often marked bydrugs, abuse, and violence.The exploitation and abuse of the talibés occurswithin a context of traditional religious education, migration, and poverty.For centuries, the daara has been a central institution of learning in Senegal.Parents have long sent their children to a marabout—frequently a relativeor someone from the same village—with whom they resided until completingtheir Quranic studies. Traditionally, children focused on their studies whileassisting with cultivation in the marabout’s fields. Begging, ifperformed at all, was rather a collection of meals from community families.Today, hundreds of thousands of talibés in Senegal attend Quranic schools,many in combination with state schools, and the practice often remains centeredon religious and moral education. Yet for at least 50,000 children, includingmany brought from neighboring countries, marabouts have profited from theabsence of government regulation by twisting religious education into economicexploitation.The forced begging, physical abuse, and dangerous dailyliving conditions endured by these talibés violate domestic andinternational law. Senegal has applicable laws on the books, but they are scantenforced. Senegal is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, theAfrican Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and all majorinternational and regional treaties on child labor and trafficking, whichprovide clear prohibitions against the worst forms of child labor, physicalviolence, and trafficking. International law also affords children the rightsto health, physical development, education, and recreation, obligating thestate, parents, and those in whose care a child finds himself to fulfill theserights.The state is the primary entity responsible for protectingthe rights of children within its borders, something which the government ofSenegal has failed to do. With the exception of a few modern daaras—whichare supported by the government and combine Quranic and state schoolcurricula—not one of the Quranic schools in Senegal is subject to anyform of government regulation. In the last decade, the government has notablydefined forced begging as a worst form of child labor and criminalized forcinganother into begging for economic gain, but this adequate legislation has sofar led to little concrete action. Rather than hold marabouts accountable forforced begging, gross neglect, or, in all but the rarest of cases, severephysical abuse, Senegalese authorities have chosen to avoid any challenge to thecountry’s powerful religious leaders, including individual marabouts.Countries from which a large number of talibés are sentto Senegal, particularly Guinea-Bissau, have likewise failed to protect theirchildren from the abuse and exploitation that await them in many urban Quranicschools in Senegal. The Bissau-Guinean government has yet to formallycriminalize child trafficking and, even under existing legal standards, hasbeen unwilling to hold marabouts accountable for the illegal cross-bordermovement of children. Guinea-Bissau has also failed domestically to fulfill theright to education—around 60 percent of children are not in its schoolsystem—forcing many parents to view Quranic schools in Senegal as theonly viable option for their children’s education.Parents and families, for their part, often send children todaaras without providing any financial assistance. After informally relinquishingparental rights to the marabout, some then turn a blind eye to the abuses theirchild endures. Many talibés who run away and make it home are returnedto the marabout by their parents, who are fully aware that the child willsuffer further from forced begging and often extreme corporal punishment. Forthese children, home is no longer a refuge, compounding the abuse they endurein the daara and leading them to plan their next escapes to a shelter or thestreet.Dozens of Senegalese and international aid organizationshave worked admirably to fill the protection gap left by state authorities. Organizationsprovide tens of centers for runaway talibés; work to sensitize parentson the difficult conditions in the daara; and administer food, healthcare, andother basic services to talibés. Yet in some cases, they have actually madethe problem worse. By focusing assistance largely on urban daaras, some aidorganizations have incentivized marabouts to leave villages for the cities, wherethey force talibés to beg. By failing to adequately monitor how maraboutsuse assistance, some organizations have made the practice even more profitable—whilemarabouts receive aid agency money with one hand, they push theirtalibés to continue begging with the other. And by treading delicatelyin their effort to maintain relations with marabouts, many aid organizationshave ceased demanding accountability and have failed to report obvious abuse.The government of Senegal has launched an initiative tocreate and subject to regulation 100 modern daaras between 2010 and 2012. Whilethe regulation requirement in these new schools is a long-overdue measure, thelimited number of daaras affected means that the plan will have little impacton the tens of thousands of talibés who are already living inexploitative daaras. The government must therefore couple efforts to introducemodern daaras with efforts, thus far entirely absent, to hold maraboutsaccountable for exploitation and abuse.Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, theCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the African Charter onthe Rights and Welfare of the Child the state is obliged to ensure thatchildren have access to a compulsory, holistic primary education that willequip them with the basic skills they need to participate fully and actively insociety. In addition to supporting the introduction of modern daaras, thegovernment of Senegal should therefore ensure that children have the choice ofaccess to free primary education through state schools or other means.Without enforced regulation of daaras and success on accountability,the phenomenon of forced child begging will continue its decades-long patternof growth. If the Senegalese government wants to retain its place as a leadingrights-respecting democracy in West Africa, it must take immediate steps toprotect these children who have been neglected by their parents and exploitedand abused in the supposed name of religion.RecommendationsTo the Government of SenegalEnforce current domestic law that criminalizes forcinganother into begging for economic gain—specifically, article 3 of LawNo. 2005-06—including by investigating and holding accountablein accordance with fair trial standards marabouts and others who force childrento beg.Consider amending the law to provide for a greater rangeof penalties, reducing the range of punishment to include onlynon-custodial sentences and prison sentences under two years, from thepresent mandatory two to five years, so that punishments can be betterapportioned to the severity of exploitation.Create a registry of marabouts who are documented byauthorities to have forced children to beg for money, or who areconvicted for physical abuse or for being grossly negligent in achild’s care.Enforce article 298 of the penalcode that criminalizes the physical abuse of children, with the exceptionof “minor assaults,” including by investigating and holding accountablein accordance with fair trial standards marabouts and others whophysically abuse talibés.Amend the law to include specific reference to all formsof corporal punishment in schools, in accordance with international law,including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the AfricanCharter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.Amend the law to ensure that it holds responsible amarabout who oversees, orders, or fails to prevent or punish an assistantteacher who inflicts physical abuse on a talibé.Enforce anti-traffickingprovisions under Law No. 2005-06, which criminalizes child trafficking inaccordance with the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol.Provide additional resources to civil and border policeunits, particularly in the regions of Ziguinchor and Kolda, to enhancetheir capacity to deter child trafficking.Improve and require periodic training for police units toensure that they know the laws governing movements of children acrossborders.Express support, from the highestlevels of government, for the prosecution of marabouts who violate lawsagainst forced begging, abuse, and trafficking.Relevant authorities within the Ministries of Interior andJustice should monitor, investigate, and, where there is evidence,discipline police, investigating judges, and prosecutors who persistentlyfail to act on allegations of abuse and exploitation by marabouts.Issue clear directives to the Brigade desmineurs (Juvenile Police) to proactively investigate abuse andexploitation, including during street patrols.Increase police capacity,particularly within the Juvenile Police, including through increasedstaffing and equipment, in order to better enforce existing laws againstforced begging and physical abuse.Provide adequate training to the Juvenile Police onmethods for interviewing children, and for protecting and assisting victimsof severe physical and psychological trauma, including sexual abuse.Ensure that children, aid workers, andothers have a safe and accessible means of reporting abuse or exploitation,including by better publicizing the state’s child-protection hotline managedby the Centre Ginddi in Dakar, and by extending availability of hotlinesand assistance elsewhere in Senegal.Introduce a law requiringhumanitarian workers to report to the police incidents of abuse,exploitation, and violations of relevant laws governing the treatment ofchildren, including the law on forced begging.Require all daaras to beregistered and periodically inspected by state officials.Enact legislation setting minimum standards under whichdaaras must operate, with particular attention to daaras that operate asresidential schools.Encourage child protection authorities to collaboratewith Islamic authorities on the development of these standards, whichshould include: minimum hours of study; promotion and development of thechild’s talent and abilities to their fullest potential, either withinthe daaras or in another educational establishment; minimum livingconditions; the maximum number of children per Quranic teacher;qualifications for opening a residential daara; and registration of thedaara for state inspection.Expand the capacity and mandate of state daara inspectorsin order to improve the monitoring of daaras throughout Senegal; empowerinspectors to sanction or close daaras that do not meet standards thatprotect the best interests of the child.Direct the Juvenile Police to investigatethe extent to which sexual abuse exists in daaras throughout Senegal. Engagetalibés, marabouts, the police, parents, community authorities, andIslamic and humanitarian organizations in establishing and publicizingadequate protection mechanisms for children who are victims of sexualabuse.Task a minister with coordinatingthe state response from the various ministries.Improve statistic-keeping on thenumber of talibés and Quranic teachers who come into contact withstate authorities, including: talibés who are in conflict with thelaw; talibés who run away and are recovered by state authorities;and Quranic teachers who are arrested and prosecuted for forcing anotherinto begging, physical abuse, or other abuses against children.Ensure the elimination ofinformal fees and other barriers to children accessing primary educationin state schools.To the Government ofGuinea-BissauEnact and enforce legislation that criminalizes childtrafficking, including sanctions for those who hire, employ, or encourageothers to traffic children on their behalf, and for those who aid and abettrafficking either in the country of origin or country of destination.Enact and enforce legislationthat criminalizes forced child begging for economic gain.Publicly declare that forcedchild begging is a worst form of child labor; follow with appropriatelegislation.Increase the capacity of civiland border police units, particularly in the regions of Bafatá andGabú, to deter child trafficking and other illegal cross-bordermovements of children.Improve and require periodic training for border units toensure that they know the laws governing movements of children acrossborders.

Bring the child to state authorities so thatthe Ministry of Justice can perform a thorough review of the child’ssituation and determine what environment will protect the child’sbest interests.Focus greater efforts onsupporting initiatives in village daaras and state schools to enablechildren in rural areas to access an education that equips them with thebasic skills they will need to participate fully and actively in society,so that children do not need to move to towns and cities to access qualityeducation.Increase pressure on thegovernment of Senegal to enforce its laws on forced begging, child abuse, andchild trafficking.To the United Nations SpecialRapporteur on Contemporary Forms of SlaveryConsider an investigation into the situation of the tensof thousands of children in Senegal who are forced to beg by their Quranicteachers, which appears to qualify as a practice akin to child slavery.To the Economic Community ofWest African StatesWork with governments in the region to improve collectiveresponse to child trafficking.To the Organisation of theIslamic ConferenceDenounce the practice of forced begging and physical abusein Quranic schools as in conflict with the Cairo Declaration andother international human rights obligations.MethodologyThis report is based on 11 weeks of field research inSenegal and Guinea-Bissau between November 2009 and February 2010. During thecourse of this research, interviews were conducted with 175 children; 33religious authorities, marabouts, and imams in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau;Senegalese and Bissau-Guinean government officials at the national and locallevels; diplomats; academics and religious historians; representatives frominternational organizations, including the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM);representatives from national and international nongovernmental organizations, nationalhuman rights groups, and community associations working in various ways toassist the talibés; and some 20 families in Senegalese andBissau-Guinean villages who had sent their children to distant cities to learnthe Quran.In Senegal, research was conducted in the capital, Dakar; inthe Dakar suburbs of Guédiawaye and Rufisque; in the cities of Saint-Louis,Thiès, Mbour, and Kolda; and in villages in the region of Saint-Louis inthe north (area called the Fouta Toro, or the Fouta) and in the region of Koldain the south. In Guinea-Bissau, research was conducted in the capital, Bissau;the cities of Bafatá and Gabú; as well as in villages in theeastern regions of Bafatá and Gabú. This field research wasaccompanied by an extensive literature review of publicly available andunpublished studies on the talibés in Senegal and Guinea-Bissauconducted by a range of international and local organizations.Of the 175 children interviewed, 73 were interviewed duringin-depth conversations, generally about one hour in length, in one of two typesof centers that assist talibés: food and healthcare assistance centersfor current talibés; and temporary shelters that assist in the care andrepatriation of runaway talibés. These sites helped ensure a secureenvironment for the children, most of whom were victims of serious abuse,during and immediately after the time of their interview. Of the 73 childreninterviewed in centers, 14 were interviewed, at the children’s request,in small groups of between two and four children from the same daara; the other59 interviews of children in centers were conducted individually and privately,with only a translator and the interviewer present.An additional 102 interviews were conducted with currenttalibés living in daaras in four Senegalese cities: Dakar, Thiès,Mbour, and Saint-Louis. These interviews normally lasted from 10 to 15 minutesand were conducted away from their daara, generally on the street. About halfof the street interviews were conducted in small groups of between two and fivetalibés, and the other half individually—depending on whether thechildren were begging in a group or alone. Privacy from other people on thestreet was ensured. Human Rights Watch did not interview children in or aroundtheir own daaras in order to help protect against acts of reprisal such asbeatings by the marabout.All interviews with talibés, marabouts, and familieswere conducted with the use of an interpreter between French and one of themain languages spoken by respective ethnic groups in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau.The vast majority of interviews were conducted in the interviewee’s firstlanguage—generally Pulaar, Wolof, or Creole.The names of all current and former talibésinterviewed for this report have been withheld in order to protect theiridentity and help ensure their security. The names of parents have also beenwithheld, even when consent was provided, to protect the identities of theirchildren who remain under the care of the marabouts. The names of somegovernment officials and representatives of nongovernmental organizations, attheir request, have likewise been withheld.Human Rights Watch identified and spoke with talibés,marabouts, and families with the assistance of humanitarian organizations thatwork with current and former talibés. Different local partners andtranslators were used in every city and, often, in each neighborhood in whichresearch was conducted.The exchange rate between the United States dollar and theWest African CFA franc (the currency used by seven West African francophonecountries as well as Guinea-Bissau) fluctuated from lows around 430 to highsaround 490 from October 2009 to March 2010. In this report, all dollar figuresuse a rate of 460 CFA to the dollar.BackgroundSenegal, the western-most country in continental Africa, hasa population estimated at around 12 million, about 95 percent of which isMuslim. The largest ethnic groups in Senegal are the Wolof (approximately 43percent of the population), Peuhl[1](24 percent), and Serer (15 percent). Independent from France since 1960,Senegal’s official language according to the constitution is French,[2]though Wolof is generally the lingua franca. Arabic is the second mostcommon language of literacy, even surpassing French—the language taughtin state schools—in some regions of Senegal.[3]Development of Islam in SenegalThe first article of Senegal’s constitution formallydefines the state as secular.[4]However, Islamic authorities, particularly through the Muslim brotherhoods thatdominate nearly all aspects of Senegalese life, wield considerable influence inthe political and economic structures of the country.The form of Islam prevalent in Senegal draws heavily fromSufism—a broad tradition that includes various mystical forms of Islam. Themovement began during the eighth century as a reaction to what was perceived asthe overly materialistic and worldly pursuits of many leaders and followers ofIslam. Sufi adherents are almost always members of tariqas, orbrotherhoods, and, in addition to learning the holy texts, place greatimportance on following the teachings and example of a personal spiritualguide.[5]There are four principal Sufi brotherhoods in Senegal: theQadriyya, the Tijaniyya,[6]the Muridiyya,[7]and the Layenne. The oldest order is the Qadriyya, but the current dominantbrotherhoods are the Tijaniyya, to which approximately half of Senegal’sMuslim population adheres, and the Muridiyya, the wealthiest andfastest-growing, followed by some 30 percent of Senegalese.[8]Each brotherhood maintains a strict hierarchy, led by acaliph, a descendant of the brotherhood’s founder in Senegal, followed bymarabouts, who serve as teachers or spiritual guides for thebrotherhood’s disciples, or talibés. Marabouts wield immenseinfluence over their disciples: the talibé is expected to be devoted andstrictly obedient; and the marabout, for his part, is expected to provideguidance and intercession throughout the disciple’s life.[9]Disciples consult marabouts for guidance on a variety of everyday and majorlife decisions and problems, such as family illness, a job search, and theharvest. Marabouts themselves are organized in a hierarchy, generally based onlineage, experience, and education. In addition, some marabouts in Senegal areimams, the leaders of mosques.During the early colonial period, between 1850 and 1910, theFrench repressed charismatic religious leaders who, with their largefollowings, the colonial administrators feared could incite rebellion.[10]However, this served only to increase the religious leaders’ popularity.[11]By around 1910, the French and the brotherhood leaders began to see thepolitical and economic benefits of adopting a more cooperative relationship. Inreturn for the religious leaders’ pacifying the population and acceptingcolonial rule, the French relinquished to them immense profits from theproduction and trade of groundnuts—one of Senegal’s most importantexports even today.[12]Post-independence, the religious leaders’ politicaland economic power continued to grow. During the presidency of LéopoldSédar Senghor, from independence to 1980, caliphs from the mainbrotherhoods issued ndiguels (religious edicts, in Wolof), guidingfollowers to vote for Senghor and the ruling Socialist Party. In return,Senghor affirmed the brotherhoods’ preeminent religious authority inSenegal and provided them considerable economic benefits.[13]In 1988, in hailing the efforts of Senghor’s successor, President Abdou Diouf,to provide roads and lighting in Touba, the Mourides’ holy capital, theMouride caliph issued a ndiguel that equated voting for the opposition with abetrayal of the Mouride founder.[14]The brazenness of this ndiguel resulted in a backlash against caliphs’overt intrusion into political life, which led subsequent caliphs to adopt asuperficially apolitical stance regarding support for a given candidate.[15]While caliphs are nominally apolitical in today’sSenegal, politicking by politicians and political candidates of individual maraboutsfor their disciples’ votes remains an active practice in national and,even more so, in local elections.[16]Human Rights Watch interviewed marabouts in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Kolda, andMbour who stated that during the last election cycle, in 2007, politicians ortheir intermediaries explicitly promised assistance in return for votes.[17]These various forms of political courting of religiousauthorities, and political involvement by religious authorities, have over theyears produced a political system in which no clear boundaries separate thereligious and civic spheres.[18]While public expression of dissent toward the government is commonplace, thepopulation and government leaders appear reluctant to express any opposition toreligious leaders, an issue acknowledged by multiple government officials andhumanitarian workers.[19]This dynamic has served to embolden those responsible for the proliferation offorced child begging and other abuses committed by the marabouts against talibéchildren.Quranic Education prior to French RuleThe introduction of Islam in Senegal brought with it thefounding of Quranic schools, or daaras. Prior to the arrival of theFrench—and even after their arrival in all but the most populouscities—Quranic schools were the principal form of education.The daaras in existence before French colonial rule, asremain today, were led by marabouts, and the students were, then as now, knownas talibés. While many talibés lived at home and studied at adaara in their village, many others were entrusted to marabouts in distantvillages. The talibés lived with the marabout at the daara, oftenwithout any contact with their parents for several years.[20]While both girls and boys undertook memorization of the Quran in their ownvillages, it was and remains almost exclusively boys whom parents confide to thecare of marabouts.In these traditional daaras that predominated throughindependence, most marabouts were also cultivators of the land—thoughtheir primary concern generally remained education.[21]During Senegal’s long dry season, emphasis was generally placed onQuranic studies. Then, during the harvest, the marabout and oldertalibés would work together in the fields to provide food for the daarafor much of the year—aided by contributions from families whosetalibés did not reside at the daara and from community members throughalmsgiving. While older talibés assisted in the fields, youngertalibés would remain in the daara and continue learning, either from themarabout or an assistant.[22]During this period, the practice of begging existed wherechildren lived at a residential daara and the harvest could not sustain thedaara’s food needs. Mamadou Ndiaye, a professor at the Islamic Institutein Dakar who has studied the daara system for three decades, described how thepractice of free boarding in Senegal’s Quranic schools led to the beggingphenomenon.[23]However, in the traditional practice, talibésgenerally did not beg for money; begging was solely for food and did not taketime away from the talibés’ studies or put them on the street. Familieswould donate a bowl of food for a talibé, who would then return to thedaara where all would eat as a community.[24]The experience emphasized mastering the Quran and obtaining the highestattainable level of Arabic. This traditional form of begging, however, bearslittle resemblance to current practice in Senegal’s cities. Indeed,Professor Ndiaye prefers to refer to these two practices using entirelyseparate terms: “la quête,” or collection, for the traditionalpractice; and “la mendicité,” or begging, for themodern practice which is the subject of this report.[25]QuranicEducation under French RuleDespite the imposition of restrictive regulations andsanctions, as well as strategic subsidies for daaras where French was taught,the French authorities were unable to significantly restrict the proliferationof Quranic schools or limit the influence of Islamic authorities over thepopulation.Between 1857 and 1900, the French colonial administration triedto limit the number of marabouts authorized to teach children the Quran, firstin the then-capital of Saint-Louis[26]and soon after throughout the region.[27]Correspondence between colonial leaders and the means they employed towardtheir goals demonstrated the central motivations behind these efforts: first, adesire to see the French language replace Arabic as the dominant scholarly andcommon language; and, second, a fear that Islam as practiced in West Africa wasnot favorable to colonial rule.[28]One colonial administrator wrote, “We are forced to ask ourselves whatcould be the utility of the study of the Quran as it is ... done in Senegal. Theresults from an intellectual point of view are negative.”[29]An 1857 order required marabouts in Saint-Louis to gainauthorization from the French governor in order to legally operate a daara. Theset of requirements for authorization—which included proof of residency,educational certificates, and certificates of good morals—were intendedto both limit the number of daaras and put out of practice individual maraboutswhom the French believed to be hostile to their rule.[30]The order also required that all marabouts send their students of 12 years ofage or older to evening classes at either a secular or Christian school inorder to learn French.[31]In 1896, the French administration extended this regulation throughoutSenegal in an order that continued the use of restrictive authorizationrequirements; forbade marabouts from receiving children between the ages of sixand 15 at Quranic schools during the hours of public education; and requiredmarabouts to obtain from all their students a certificate proving attendance atFrench school.[32]If a marabout operated a daara without authorization, or failed to comply withthe law, he could be punished with a fine and, for the first time,imprisonment.[33]These acts angered the population, who saw them as meddlingwith their religious affairs.[34]Most children continued to attend Quranic schools and French spread slowly. Manymarabouts continued to teach without authorization, and even those who hadauthorization generally failed to comply with official requirements.[35]In the early 20thcentury, the colonial authorities continued attempts to limit the influence ofIslam and Arabic in favor of French rule and language, but changed theirapproach, from the “stick” of over-regulation and punitivesanctions, to cooperation and cash payments to marabouts who set aside twohours a day for French instruction.[36]In another proactive effort, the French in 1908 establishedthe Madrasa of Saint-Louis. A school run by the colonial authorities, itspurpose, as stated by the governor general of French West Africa, was “tofight against the proselytizing by those [hostile] marabouts and to improve thecurrent, degraded teaching of Arabic through forming an official corps ofmarabouts.”[37]Scholarships were awarded with a distinct focus on attracting the sons ofleading and influential families. The goal was to train future Senegalesepolitical and religious leaders who would be more inclined to support theFrench.[38]The Madrasa’s curriculum included French, traditional school subjects,Arabic, and the Quran—prioritized in that order.[39]Subsidies for Quranic schools that taught French and thetraining of religious and political leaders expanded the reach of the Frenchlanguage and French colonial authority. However, in most regions, parentscontinued to prefer traditional Quranic schools.[40]Throughout the entire colonial period, the traditional model of thedaara—in which children assisted with the harvest and collected meals,but did not beg for money and instead spent the vast majority of their time onmastering the Quran—remained most prevalent. Ultimately unsatisfied withthe results of the “carrot” approach as well, the colonialadministration abandoned such attempts. A 1945 order stated that Quranicschools were not to be considered educational schools and were not to be givensubsidies under any circumstances.[41]Because the French authorities’ efforts were soexplicitly intended to limit the influence of Islam and religious leaders, theyhave had a long-lasting impact on later attempts to regulate the daaras: nearlyall proposed or enacted regulations have been immediately interpreted byreligious leaders as anti-Quranic education and anti-Islam. When a number ofmarabouts in the post-independence period began to use Quranic education as acover for the exploitation of talibés, the Senegalese government’simmediate and continued failure to challenge religious authorities on thispoint allowed an ever-worsening system of exploitation and abuse to develop.Quranic Education Post-Independence: Rising Tide of ForcedBeggingIn the post-independence period since 1960, village-baseddaaras have increasingly given way to urban daaras, in which the practice offorced child begging has become more and more prevalent. Immediately followingindependence, village-based daaras remained the most common and were the soleoption for a religious education, which was not provided by the secular stateschools, still widely referred to as “French schools.” Then, severedroughts in the late 1970s brought an influx of migrants, including marabouts,from Senegal’s villages to its cities.[42]Unable to make use of the traditional forms of support as were available in thevillages, many marabouts began forcing talibés to beg. By the 1980s,forced child begging was ubiquitous in Senegal’s cities, withprofitability attracting numerous unscrupulous marabouts.[43]At present, the practice of child begging in Senegal is almost wholly linked toresidential Quranic schools: a 2007 study by the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), the International Labour Organization (ILO),and the World Bank found that 90 percent of children begging in Dakar and itssuburbs were talibés.[44]While the government has categorically failed to respond tothe known prevalence of exploitation and abuse of children associated withresidential Quranic schools, it has made mild, unsuccessful attempts at largerreform of the education system. In an attempt to attract some families to thestate education system, the Senegalese government introduced at independencethe option of Arabic study in state schools,[45]but religious instruction was explicitly banned in state schools until 2004.Thousands of Senegalese families who prioritized religious education continuedto send their children to daaras, contributing to the proliferation of Islamicassociations and Arabic schools.[46]At the onset of urban migration in the 1970s, many maraboutsran seasonal daaras, where marabouts and talibés would live in the cityduring the dry season and then return to the village to prepare for theharvest.[47]Then, as the profits obtainable from forced begging and the greater comforts ofurban life became apparent, most marabouts remained in the cities all year.Professor Ndiaye explained these developments, and the negative effect thatforced begging has had on children’s Quranic education:Over time, the marabouts started to stay in the cities allyear—they weighed the pros and cons and thought it was more favorable tostay in Dakar. Some marabouts became more at ease in Dakar—there wascoffee, rice, fish, clean water. Why return to the village, where they had towork the land for long hours, when [in the city] a child comes daily withmoney, sugar, and rice? As a result, some marabouts reduced the hours ofQuranic learning, because the longer the child remains in the daara learning,the less opportunity he has to bring money. The longer he stays outside thedaara, the more the marabout can maximize the money that the talibésbring.[48]Emphasis on AlmsgivingAcademics and Senegalese humanitarianofficials working with the talibés noted how almsgiving—botha central tenet of the Islamic faith and a widely practiced custom inSenegal—has had the effect of contributing to the entrenchment of thetalibé problem, and as a result, the exploitation and abuses associatedwith child begging. Professor Ndiaye described this phenomenon:In Senegal, people love to give alms.... People here need apopulation to give to. Disciples go to their marabout at crucial times—forexample, when they want an important job—and the marabout will say thatif they want to achieve this, they must give 50 CFA (US$0.11) to 10 talibés.[49]This should not be construed to suggest that most Senegaleseare in favor of the exploitative and abusive practices carried out against thetalibés as detailed in this report. Rather, the attendant need felt bymany Senegalese to give alms, coupled with the widespread presence of beggingtalibés, has at once been exploited by many marabouts and contributed tothe normalization of the practice throughout Senegal.Types of Quranic Schools Present Today in SenegalVillage DaaraA form present in almost every Senegalese village,it generally preserves the traditional focus on memorizing the Quran. In manyvillage daaras, children live at home with their families, attending stateschools in the morning and the daara in the afternoon, or vice versa.Children residing at the daara assist the marabout with cultivation duringthe harvest and with other tasks such as the collection of wood and water.Seasonal DaaraAlmost nonexistent now, particularly in Dakar,marabouts and talibés live in cities during the dry season, withtalibés generally forced to beg for money. During the rainy season, toprepare for the harvest, marabouts return to the village, often with thetalibés who help cultivate.Urban Daara with Few or No Talibés Residingat the DaaraFrequently led by imams at daaras connected withmosques, these daaras are overwhelmingly comprised of children who residewith their families in the surrounding neighborhood. Most of these childrenalso attend state school. There is generally no begging.Urban Daara with Talibés Residing at the DaaraComprising the majority of daaras in cities,children often come from rural areas in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau to live andlearn from a marabout. Under the pretext that begging is essential to sustainthe daara and inculcate humility, many marabouts force their talibésto beg for long hours on the streets. The hours of actual Quranic educationvary considerably.“Modern” DaaraThough still relatively few in number, these daarashave introduced fields of study other than memorizing the Quran and learningArabic, including French and state school subjects. Begging for money isgenerally not performed, as the modern daaras are often financed byinscription fees, religious authorities, the state, foreign aid, andhumanitarian aid agencies.Exploitation and Abuses Endured by theTalibés in SenegalEach of us has our own technique to survive.– Abu J., 12-year-old talibé in Saint-Louis[50]In every major Senegalese city, thousands of young boysdressed in dirty rags trudge back and forth around major intersections, banks,supermarkets, gas stations, and transport hubs begging for money, rice, andsugar. Often barefoot, the boys, known as talibés, hold out a smalltomato can or plastic bowl to those passing by, hoping to fulfill the dailyquota demanded by their teachers, or marabouts, who oversee their schoolingand, usually, living quarters. Typically the children are forced to beg forlong hours every day and are beaten, often brutally, for lacking the tiniestamount. On the street they are vulnerable to car accidents, disease, and oftenscorching heat.Inside the daaras, the boys are subjected to deplorableconditions and, at times, physical and sexual abuse from older boys. The boysare typically crammed into a room within an abandoned structure that offersscant protection against rain or seasonal cold. Many choose to sleep outside,exposed to the elements. Very few are fed by their marabouts; instead, theymust beg to feed themselves, leaving many malnourished and constantly hungry.When they fall sick, which happens often, they seldom receive help from themarabout in obtaining medicines. Ultimately exploited, beaten, and uncared for,at least hundreds every year dare to run away, often choosing the hardship of alife on the streets over the abuse of life in the daara.Forced begging places children in a harmful situation on thestreet and therefore meets the ILO’s definition of a worst form of childlabor. Moreover, as the forced begging and gross neglect is done with a viewtoward exploitation, with the marabout receiving the child from his parents andprofiting from the child’s labor, it amounts to a practice akin toslavery.Large and GrowingProblemIn the environment of all-powerful religious brotherhoods,limited government response, and the migration of marabouts to urban centerswhere forced begging has proliferated, tens of thousands of talibéchildren in Senegal, the vast majority under 12 years old, endure exploitationand severe abuses. Each year, more and more children fall victim to this systemof abuse.Precise estimates of the number of talibés forced tobeg are difficult to ascertain, as children are constantly running away andmarabouts, emboldened by the absence of government regulation, frequently openup new daaras. However, based on field research and censuses by academics andhumanitarian workers interviewed for this report, Human Rights Watch estimates thereto be at least 50,000 talibés in Senegal who are forced to beg with aview toward exploitation by their teachers, out of the hundreds of thousands ofboys attending Quranic schools in total.The Senegalese government’s enactment in 2005 of a lawthat criminalized forcing another into begging for financial gain, as well asefforts to improve conditions in daaras by local and international aid agencies,have failed to stem either the growing numbers of talibés or the serioushuman rights violations associated with the practice of forced begging anddaara life. Evidence of the growing problem includes:A Senegalese government official working within the Ministryof Family, Food Security, Women’s Entrepreneurship, Microfinance,and Small Children (Ministry of Family) in Mbour (80 kilometers south ofDakar) registered a near doubling of daaras in the city between 2002 and2009, including many in which marabouts subjected children to the practiceof forced begging.[51]A government official who had previously worked inZiguinchor (480 kilometers south of Dakar) told Human Rights Watch: “Ziguinchoris an example of the fast rise of the begging talibés phenomenon.Up until 1995, the city had barely encountered the presence of these talibés.Now there are thousands.”[52]According to an experienced local aid worker in Saint-Louis(270 kilometers north of Dakar), the number of talibés, includingboth those who are forced to beg and those who are not, has doubled since2005 from an estimated 7,000 to 14,000.[53]According to the director of Samusocial Senegal, aninternational aid organization that provides healthcare to vulnerablestreet children in Dakar, including current and former talibés, “Therehas been an increase in 2009 in the number of street children in Dakar anda lowering in the age of the kids on the street.”[54]Profile: Young and Farfrom HomeOf the 175 talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch,roughly half were 10 years of age or younger.[55]On average, the children had begun living at the daara at seven years of age,though Human Rights Watch interviewed talibés who arrived at the daara whenonly three years old.[56]Many talibés in Senegal are from neighboring countries, most notablyGuinea-Bissau, and are thrust into a neighborhood or city where few peoplespeak their language. Combined with their age and distance from home, they findthemselves entirely dependent on the marabout, their fellow talibés,and, more often than not, themselves.[57]The profiles of talibés interviewed by Human RightsWatch suggest that the practice of forced begging is not limited to children ofany one ethnic group, region, or neighboring country. While boys from the Peuhlethnic group were disproportionately represented amongst the talibésinterviewed in most cities—some 58 percent of the talibésinterviewed by Human Rights Watch were Peuhl, though the Peuhl ethnicitycomprises only one-quarter of Senegal’s population—there were alarge number of Wolofs as well. And while a large portion of the talibépopulation in Dakar hailed from Guinea-Bissau, they were a clear minority inmost other Senegalese cities. No matter their places of origin, nearly alltalibés who reside at the daara are far from home and rarely, if ever,in contact with their families.Of the 175 talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch,the majority (about 60 percent) were Senegalese. However, there were also manyfrom Guinea-Bissau (about a quarter of those interviewed) and smaller, thoughsignificant numbers of talibés from the Gambia and Guinea. Of all thoseinterviewed, the majority came from the Peuhl ethnic group (nearly 60 percent)followed by the Wolof (40 percent).Ethnicities of TalibésInterviewed by Human Rights WatchPlaces of Origin of TalibésInterviewed by Human Rights WatchClick to expand ImageClick to expand ImageWhile samples were insufficient to effectively estimate proportionsof talibés by ethnicity or country of origin in each city, Human RightsWatch’s research revealed several distinct patterns of migration relatedto various cities:In Dakar, only about half the talibés interviewedwere from Senegal, with almost as many hailing from Guinea-Bissau.[58]In some neighborhoods, over 90 percent of interviewees were fromGuinea-Bissau, whereas in other neighborhoods, Senegalese predominated.[59]A clear majority were Peuhl, followed by Wolof and a few Serer.[60]In Saint-Louis, about 80 percent of talibésinterviewed were from Senegal, followed by Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, andMauritania.[61]Talibés of the Peuhl ethnicity comprised the overwhelming majority.In Thiès, about 60 percent of talibésinterviewed were from Senegal. The largest number from a neighboringcountry hailed from the Gambia, with small percentages from Guinea-Bissau,Mali, and Mauritania.[62]Over half were Wolof, followed closely by Peuhl.In a limited number of interviews in Mbour, the vastmajority of talibés interviewed were from Senegal, followed by theGambia. All but one of the talibés were Wolof.[63]The Story of Ousmane B., a 13-Year-Old FormerTalibé[64]I am fromthe region of Tambacounda. My father decided to send me to learn the Quranwhen I was six. My mother didn’t want me to leave, but my fathercontrolled the decision.The daarawasn’t a good place, and there were more than 70 of us there. If it wasthe rainy season, the rain came into where we slept. The cold season was alsodifficult. We didn’t have any cover and there were no mats, so we sleptonly on the ground. A lot of the talibés slept outside, because it wasmore comfortable.I did nothave any shoes, and only one shirt and one pair of pants. The marabout hadthree sons, and when I got clean clothes, the marabout would take them fromme and give them to his own children. The marabout paid for his children togo to a modern daara—they didn’t beg.When wewere sick, the marabout never bought medicines. We would either come tocenters where they would treat us, or we would use our own money to buymedicines. If I told the marabout I was sick and couldn’t beg, themarabout would take me to a room and beat me—just as if I was not ableto bring the sum. So I had to go to the streets, even when I was sick.The normalhours for studying were from 6 to 7:30 a.m., 9 to 11 a.m., and 3 to 5 p.m. Ibegged for money and breakfast from 7:30 to 9 a.m., for money and lunch from11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for money and dinner from 5 to 8 p.m. When I firstarrived, I had to bring 100 CFA (US$0.22) a day—that was the sum forthe youngest. As I got older, the marabout raised the quota to 300 CFA($0.65), half a kilogram of rice, and 50 CFA ($0.11) worth of sugar. I sawthe marabout sell the rice in the community; he never used it to feed us. Ihave heard from talibés there now that the quota is up to 500 CFA($1.09). Even then, it was very difficult for me to find the sum. It was easyon Friday, the holy day, but on many other days I had problems.When Icouldn’t bring the quota, which happened at least every week, themarabout would take me into the room where the oldest talibés slept.Then he wrapped rope cord around my wrists and beat me with electric cable,over and over. I still have marks on my back (these marks were shown to HumanRights Watch). As bad as it was with the marabout, when he was gone it waseven worse. The oldest talibés were really nasty. They would take ourmoney and then beat us really badly if we missed the quota—I would juststay out and keep begging, sleep on the street if necessary.Begging isdifficult. We ended up having to do whatever it took to get the daily sum,even steal. To be a talibé, it’s not easy.Nature of Forced Begging: Out of the Classroom and ontothe StreetBegging is a difficult thing, because I would spend allday begging and sometimes I might end up with nothing.– Mamadou S., eight-year-old former talibé in Thiès[65]In hundreds of urban residential daaras, the maraboutappears to emphasize forced begging over learning the Quran. As one humanitarianworker who works closely with talibés told Human Rights Watch, “Inthe urban daaras, there is a pretext of education with a real purpose ofexploitation.”[66]In principle, the marabout is responsible for impartingmastery of the Quran and a moral education on the talibé. In practice,the talibés are the marabout’s workers, forced to spend long hourseach day on the streets in search of money, rice, and sugar for themarabout—who uses almost none of it for their benefit. With educationoften secondary to fulfilling the quota, mastering the Quran takes two or threetimes longer than it would if the children received a proper education,according to Islamic scholars in Senegal.LongHours in Search of MoneyWhile the traditional daara placed primary focus on masteringthe Quran, the contemporary urban residential daara often focuses on maximizingthe marabout’s wealth. Amadou S., 10, told Human Rights Watch that eachday the marabout gathers the children at 6 a.m. and, before sending them offinto the streets, encourages them by saying, “The rice is there, goodluck!”[67]The talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch spent on average 7 hoursand 42 minutes, spaced throughout the day, begging for either money or food.[68]Begging is therefore a full-time job for the talibés, generally performedseven days a week.[69]The vast majority of marabouts in urban daaras demand aspecific sum that the talibés must bring back each day.[70]This quota varies between daaras and even within an individual daara: theyoungest and newly arrived are required to bring slightly less; those between eightand 15 years old must bring the most; and those over 15 are often exempt frombegging.For the 175 talibés interviewed by Human RightsWatch, the average daily quota of money demanded by the marabout was 373 CFA($0.87), except for Friday, where as a result of some marabouts setting higherquotas to take advantage of greater almsgiving on the holy day, the averagequota was 445 CFA ($0.97).[71]In a country where approximately 30 percent of the population lives on lessthan a dollar a day,[72]and the gross domestic product per capita is approximately $900,[73]this is a considerable and often difficult sum to achieve. The quota variesgreatly by city, as shown in the text box below, but the hours spent beggingeach day are remarkably consistent. The principal difference is that Dakar is afar richer city, which results in a higher quota.Average Begging Quota in CFA andHours by CityNormalDaysFridayHoursDakar4636427hrs, 42 minsSaint-Louis2282287hrs, 36 minsThiès2542687hrs, 54 minsMbour2462467hrs, 18 minsIn addition to money, many marabouts require that theirtalibés bring back sugar and uncooked rice. Just over 50 percent oftalibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch had a quota for either rice orsugar, around 14 percent had a quota for both rice and sugar, and 35 percentonly had to bring whatever they could. The daily quotas ranged from half akilogram to three kilograms of rice, and from 50 to 100 CFA ($0.11-$0.22) worthof sugar.In daaras where quantities of rice or sugar are demanded,every talibé told Human Rights Watch that none of what they brought backwas ever used for their own consumption. The account of Samba G., eight yearsold, was typical of what occurred in daaras with high rice quotas or a largenumber of talibés: “When you brought in the rice, the marabout wouldfill up large [50-kilogram] bags. When they were full, he would send them backto his village or he would sell them in the neighborhood.”[74]A 50-kilogram bag of rice sells for around 20,000 CFA ($43.50) in Dakar.As the forced begging is done “with a view”toward exploitation, with the marabout receiving the child from his parents andprofiting from the child’s labor, it amounts to a practice akin toslavery.[75]Going to the City: SuburbanTalibés’ Holy Day on Dakar’s StreetsIn one of the most exploitative practices, manymarabouts in Dakar’s suburbs force their talibés, eitherexplicitly or indirectly, through an elevated quota of 750 ($1.63) to 1,500CFA ($3.26), to travel into Dakar from Thursday to Saturday in order tomaximize their earnings. They beg around the main mosques in Dakar,particularly on the Friday holy day when Senegalese give greater alms. HumanRights Watch interviewed over a dozen talibés from different suburbs,including Guédiawaye, Mbao, Pikine, and Keur Massar (ranging from 10to 30 kilometers outside Dakar), and the vast majority said that they engagedin this practice.An 11-year-old talibé in Keur Massardescribed waking up at 5 a.m. on Thursday to catch public transport intoDakar, hopping off and walking when caught not paying. He, like the others,would then beg all day Thursday before sleeping on Dakar’s streetsThursday night. A full day of begging on Friday follows, either with a returnto the suburb on Friday night or, more often, another night on the streetbefore returning Saturday morning.Rather than attending mosque with theirtalibés on Friday, marabouts are widely subjecting children to 16-hourwork days and nights on the streets.Injuryand Death from Car AccidentsThe hours spent on the street begging put talibés atconsiderable risk of injury and death from car accidents. It is a common sightto see talibés, some as young as four years old, weaving precariouslybetween cars on major streets, approaching cars as they pull into and out ofdriveways and in inter-city transport hubs, and sticking their hand or bowlinto car windows in the hopes that alms will be given.Human Rights Watch documented four cases of death as aresult of car accidents, and interviewed nine talibés who had beenvictims of car accidents, with injuries ranging from soreness and bruises tomultiple broken bones. In addition, a marabout interviewed by Human Rights Watchsaid that an eight-year-old talibé under his de facto guardianship hadin late 2009 suffered breaks to both of his legs in a car accident.[76]A father of a former talibé told Human Rights Watch that his son had in2006 suffered a serious injury to his arm as a result of a car accident inDakar, which still affected him three years later.[77]While a small sample, all four deaths documented by HumanRights Watch occurred in Dakar—not surprising given the greater level oftraffic in the capital. All the deaths and injuries documented happened whilethe talibés were begging. A 2007 study on begging children in Dakar notedthat the conditions on the street inherently expose begging children todangers, particularly illnesses and car accidents.[78]Likewise, government officials and directors of international humanitarianorganizations and local human rights organizations all related to Human RightsWatch that the dangers on the street, including from car accidents, placed thetalibés in an extremely vulnerable position for long hours each day.[79]Pape M., 13, witnessed the death of a friend and fellowtalibé in a car accident in Dakar in 2007. He emotionally told HumanRights Watch:My friend—we begged together—was killed by acar. It happened when the sun was almost down, during the cold season. We were outbegging and a car hit him. It was a big car. I don’t know how ithappened. The car just hit him and he died, right next to me. The car stoppedand people came around. People were shouting at the driver. I think he wastaken to the hospital—someone took him in a car—but he died. Inever heard the marabout talk about it.[80]Two other talibés told Human Rights Watch that afellow talibé in their daara had been killed by a car accident, butneither was present when it happened.[81]A traditional chief in Guinea-Bissau losta talibé nephew to a car accident in Dakar, concluding that “thepractice of forced begging on the street is truly terrible for the children.”[82]Nine talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch describedhaving suffered injuries from car accidents. Bouba D., nine years old, wasinjured while begging near the transport terminal in Thiès:I was hit at the place where the cars leave.Iwas standing on the side of the road begging near one station wagon whenanother car came by and struck me. It wasn’t bad—I didn’tbreak any bones. But several other talibés from my daara have beenstruck by cars here too, and they have suffered broken bones. One his leg,one his arm. Accidents happen frequently.[83]Similarly, Ibrahima T., 13, related:I was hit by a motorbike once and hurt my knee. I was onthe side of the road—the road from Dakar to Rufisque—but themotorbike came off the road and struck me. My knee still hurts sometimes, andthis was several years ago. The marabout never took me to the hospital.[84]The frequent accidents demonstrate one of the many ways thatforced begging meets the ILO definition of a worst form of child labor andconstitutes a violation of the child’s right to physical security andprotection from injury, and, in cases of death, a violation of the right tolife.[85]The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires the state to take allappropriate measures to safeguard the children’s right to physical andmental security. Marabouts, as de facto guardians, are failing to act in thebest interests of the child as is also required under the CRC.[86]Denying the Right to EducationThe limited timetalibés spend in Quranic classes in most urban daaras, as compared with thetime spent begging, brings into question not only the motives of the marabouts,but also the relative value of education received in the daaras.The number of hours the talibés interviewed by HumanRights Watch spent in classes varied greatly—from less than one hour perday to as much as eight hours. However, they almost unanimously describedspending more time begging for money and food than they spent in the classroomlearning the Quran. On average, they spent nearly eight hours a day begging andonly five hours a day scheduled for Quranic classes.Talibés from several daaras made clear that the hoursof study were strictly enforced; however, in the majority of daaras from whichtalibés were interviewed, it was clear that scheduledhours farsurpassed actual hours of learning. Human Rights Watch interviewed tens oftalibés in the street in the midst of hours that they said were setaside for studying; when asked why they were not in class at the daara, theyuniversally responded that they would not go back until completing the quota. Inaddition, many talibés said that the long hours on the street make itdifficult for them to concentrate even while at the daara, due to hunger andgeneral fatigue.The result is that in many urban residential daaras, thetalibés’ progress in learning to master the Quran and read andwrite Arabic, as well as their ability to access education in other basicskills, is severely undermined by the marabouts’ apparent prioritizationof begging over classroom time. One marabout in Mbour told Human Rights Watch: “Ihave never begged my talibés because I want them to learn. The mostimportant part of the apprenticeship is the Quran, and the hours of beggingtake away from that.”[87]The president of ONG Gounass, a humanitarian organization in Kolda that worksclosely with daaras in the region and operates a modern daara, likewiserelated:The student is there supposedly learning the Quran. Butthere are many children that pass 10 to 15 years in the daaras and they knowneither the Quran nor a true understanding of Islam. They leave the daarawithout any skills and without even knowing the Quran.[88]The right to education under the CRC includes an education “designedto empower the child by developing his or her skills, learning and othercapacities, human dignity, self-esteem and self-confidence.”[89]Where a child barely learns the Quran and no other educational material, thisright is clearly left unfulfilled. Article 7(b) of the Cairo Declaration onHuman Rights in Islam gives parents the right to choose the form of educationfor their children, so long as they take into consideration the child’sinterests;[90]and article 9(b) states that “[e]very human being has a right to receiveboth religious and worldly education.”[91]While Quranic education can therefore be an integral part to a child’sself-development, tens of thousands of talibés in Senegal are failing toreceive either a religious education or an education in other basic skills.Severe Physical AbuseEach time I was beaten, I would think of my family whonever laid a hand on me.– Abdou K., 11-year-old former talibé[92]The overwhelming majority of talibés interviewed byHuman Rights Watch reported suffering repeated, often severe, physical abuse inthe daara. Beatings were most frequently reported within the context offailing to return the daily quota, although there were tens of talibéswho were also beaten for failure to master the Quranic verses. Thephysical abuse was perpetrated by the marabout himself or, to a lesser extent,an older talibé, or “grand” talibé, who served as anassistant teacher.[93]Talibés typically described being taken to a room, strippedof their shirt, and beaten with an electric cable or a club—usuallystruck repeatedly on the back and neck. Some were subjected to stresspositions, chained to a piece of furniture, or bound or shackled during thebeating. More than 20 talibés revealed to Human Rights Watch welts andscars resulting from beatings they had received. The children expressedprofound levels of fear at what would await them should they fail to meet themarabout’s established quota.Malick L., a 13-year-old former talibé, showed HumanRights Watch the scars from the beatings he had suffered at the hands of hismarabout more than a year before. He recounted his experience, which was typicalof many other talibés interviewed:When I could not bring the quota, the marabout beatme—even if I lacked 5 CFA ($0.01), he beat me. It was always the marabouthimself. He took out the electric cable and we went to the room. I stood thereand ... he hit me over and over, generally on the back but at times he missedand hit my head. I still have marks on my back from the beatings.[94]Not surprisingly, all but one of the talibés interviewedby Human Rights Watch who had run away from their daaras said that they had beenbeaten repeatedly for failing to bring enough money; the other was brutallybeaten for mistakes in memorizing the Quran. Of the 139 current talibésinterviewed, 77 percent described being beaten for failing to collect thequota. Human Rights Watch believes that this percentage may be even higher,given the apparent fear among children interviewed in groups, particularly onthe street, that other talibés might report to the marabout what hadbeen discussed with the researcher.[95]Of those who described being beaten for failing to collectthe quota, the overwhelming majority stated that it happened each and everytime that they could not bring the quota. Other talibés described beingbeaten only after being given a “second chance” to complete thequota, as Boubacar D., 12, told Human Rights Watch:If we cannot bring the quota one day, our name is put onthe board with the sum we owe. We are in debt. If we cannot bring it all thenext day, then we are beaten badly with electric cable.[96]Every talibé but one stated that the punishment wasinflicted by the marabout himself or with his clear knowledge andendorsement—since he was, at a minimum, physically present when some of thebeatings occurred.[97]Determining the precise frequency of the beatings isdifficult, as many of the talibés are very young and conceptions of timeare not always accurate. All but one former talibé interviewed by HumanRights Watch said that they suffered the beatings at least once a week, andmany said two or three times. Among current talibés, answers varied fromvery rarely to every day.[98]A large number of talibés said that their beatings were particularlycommon on Saturdays and Sundays, since there are far fewer people on thestreets to give money.During in-depth interviews, talibés identified anumber of different objects that marabouts and other teachers had used to beat them.Most commonly cited was electric cable (39 cases, including one in which a longstrip of iron was attached to inflict additional damage), followed by a club(13 cases), a cane (six), a whip (four), a hand (three), a tire strip (three),rope cord (two), and “whatever is lying around” (two).Human Rights Watch also documented multiple cases ofmarabouts using stress positions to accompany beatings.[99]Chérif B., 11, told Human Rights Watch:If I can’t bring the quota, then the marabout beatsme with an electric cable or a club. He takes us into a room and brings othertalibés in to watch. Every time he forces us to hold our ears and moveup and down as he strikes us—he keeps striking while we do this until wetumble over. If we tumble over right away, he starts again.[100]Eight talibés described being chained or bound withrope during beatings by their marabout or an assistant.[101]Ibrahima T., 13, recounted being repeatedly bound and beaten in a daara in a Dakarsuburb before running away in 2009:Every time I could not complete the quota by 10 a.m., oneof the grand talibés would take me into a room and chain me around myankles. Then he would beat me with electric cable or a tire strip—thestrikes were too numerous to count. After he finished, the grand talibéwould leave me there, chained, until seven at night, sometimes beating me again....The punishment was the same for arriving late. If I came back after 10 a.m.,even with the quota, I was chained until nighttime and beaten—themarabout was very strict about it.[102]One marabout employed a particularly heinous method ofpunishment, in which he forced the youngest talibés to brutalize each otheror suffer additional consequences (see text box of the story of Laye B. below).The talibés almost universally described thebeatings—and the fear of a coming beating when they were unable tocollect the quota—as the worst abuse in the daara. Babacar R., 14,related:Begging is too difficult because if I do not have the dailyquota, the grand talibé beats me. He hits me everywhere—on thehead, the back, everywhere, and over and over. It’s difficult, it’svery painful.... I want to return home and work in my village. I don’twant to be here.”[103]Moreover, the gross neglect, deprivation, and serious humanrights abuses endured by tens of thousands of talibés at the hands ofmany marabouts are augmented when, as is common, the marabout is either absentor leaves the daara for days or even weeks. Human Rights Watch documented 18cases in which the marabout lived in a house separate from the daara where thetalibés slept, including some instances when the marabout only came tothe daara on certain days.[104]Tens of talibés described how their marabouts left the city multipletimes a year to return to home villages—sometimes for holidays, sometimesto bring back more talibés.[105]In each of these daaras, talibés as young as four are left under thesupervision of older talibés, generally around 18 years old. Under suchcircumstances, older talibés are responsible for frequent beatings,stealing money from younger talibés, and sexual abuse.[106]Talibés who said that they were not beaten generallyacknowledged another form of dangerous punishment: refusing entry into thedaara. Talibés in these daaras said that while their marabout did notstrike them, they could not come back to the daara until they completed thequota. This restriction often resulted in their begging late into the night or,alternatively, sleeping on the streets.[107]In only around 7 percent of Human Rights Watch’s interviews didtalibés say that there was no punishment at all for failing to bring thequota.The fear of corporal punishment or of being forced to sleepoutside for failing to meet their quota has driven some talibés to turnto stealing. Seydou R., 13, was one of several talibés to describe thisphenomenon to Human Rights Watch:Because we were scared of being beaten for not having thesum, all of us would steal something and give the money to the marabout if wewere in danger of not collecting the sum. We would do anything to get the 300CFA ($0.65).[108]A government official of the Action Educative en MilieuOuvert (AEMO), a part of the Ministry of Justice that works with children,told Human Rights Watch that the problem of talibés implicated in theft,seemingly driven by their need to attain the required quota, is increasing eachyear.[109]The result, as stressed by a government official within the Ministry of Family,is that “over time, because of the tough life they have led and becausethey are forced to steal, it becomes difficult to integrate them intoproductive life.”[110]The severe physical abuse that many marabouts inflict on thetalibés in their care, as well as the looming threat of violence, violatesthe children’s right to freedom from physical and mental violence andabuse. Under the CRC, the state is obligated to protect children from suchabuse whether committed by a parent, a legal guardian, or any other personcaring for the child—clearly applying to a marabout who acts as a defacto guardian.[111]The Committee on the Rights of the Child, the body charged with interpretingthe CRC, has stated that the prohibition against physical and mental violence alsoapplies to corporal punishment in schools.[112]The physical abuse likewise places the marabout in conflict with Senegal’spenal code, which provides particular care to children.[113]In addition, particularly in cases in which chaining, binding,stress positions, and other more brutal forms of punishment are used, thephysical abuse may rise to the level of torture under the Convention againstTorture. The Committee against Torture has stated:[W]here State authorities or othersacting in official capacity or under colour of law, know or have reasonablegrounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being committed bynon-State officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due diligenceto prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials orprivate actors consistently with the Convention, the State bears responsibilityand its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwiseresponsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in suchimpermissible acts.[114]Violations of the Rightsto Food, Physical Development, and HealthHuman Rights Watch found that many marabouts are grosslynegligent in providing for the health and nutritional needs of thetalibés for whom they are responsible. Children are subjected to severe overcrowding,a lack of sanitation, and inadequate protection from weather. The poorconditions in the daara are combined with a lack of clothes and shoes for thetalibés’ long days on the street, which increases theirvulnerability to disease. Forced to beg for food, many are also extremelymalnourished. Often sick, their marabout rarely provides medicines, requiringthem to beg even greater hours in order to pay for their own treatment; moreoften, they suffer from the illness—no matter how severe—andcontinue begging to satisfy the quota. Human Rights Watch documented the casesof two talibés who died from illnesses, in both cases believed to befrom malaria not adequately treated by the marabout.[115]Conditionsin the DaaraHuman Rights Watch visited over 40 urban residential daarasthroughout Senegal. In the vast majority, conditions severely undermined thechildren’s rights to health and an adequate standard of living forphysical and mental development. Serious overcrowding, a lack of sanitation andrunning water, a lack of adequate protection from harsh weather conditions, andthe instability of the daara structures themselves posed a serious health riskto the talibés.Most of the daaras visited were situated in abandoned,partially constructed structures or makeshift thatched compounds with concreteor sand floors, which offered little protection from the heat, rain, orcold—compounded by a lack of cover and, in some cases, even something asbasic as a mat to sleep on. The daaras are also extremely overcrowded with poorsanitation, leaving talibés dirty and vulnerable to bites from mosquitoesand other insects.One daara visited by Human Rights Watch in Saint-Louis waslocated in the middle of the neighborhood garbage dump, surrounded by standingwater and refuse. While dismal, the daara was described as an upgrade overwhere the talibés had formerly been housed—the back of anabandoned truck.[116]In Mbour, one talibé was killed and four others were seriously injuredin December 2009 when the partially constructed building acting as their daaracollapsed at night.[117]While these were two of the most extreme cases documented by Human Rights Watch,the average daara is hardly much better.Many boys interviewed by Human Rights Watch complained aboutthe cold they suffered during Senegal’s winter—from December throughMarch—when nightly temperatures routinely descend to 60 degreesFahrenheit, or 17 degrees Celsius.[118]Very few of them had any form of cover, as described by nine-year-old MoussaA.:There are 57 of us and we all sleep in two rooms. It isvery cold right now and we sleep on mats, with no cover. When it gets cold, wehuddle and sleep as close together as possible to try to stay warm, but it isreally hard. Some nights we hardly sleep.[119]Indeed, 56 percent of talibés interviewed said thatthey had no cover at all in the daara. Nearly all the others who reportedhaving some form of cover said it had been provided by a humanitarianorganization or marraines (community godmothers),[120]or was made by the talibés themselves.[121]Moreover, just over 30 percent of talibés interviewedby Human Rights Watch said that they slept directly on the ground. The restalmost all slept on thin mats or rice sacks stuffed with anything soft that thetalibés could find. Human Rights Watch visited only one daara in whichtalibés slept in beds—they had been provided by a humanitarianorganization in Mbour.Many talibés complained of severe overcrowding.Daaras ranged in size from only six talibés to more than 200, with mosthousing around 40 talibés. In the vast majority of daaras with fewerthan 40 talibés, all of them—from ages four to 18—slept in asingle room. As the daara size increased, additional rooms generally housing nofewer than 30 talibés each were added. The result, as explained byAlassane L., 12 years old, was that many move outside to sleep:In Mbao [a suburb of Dakar], there were around 30 studentsin the daara and one room. It was a small room and ... there was not muchspace. It was so crowded that when it was hot outside, it became so hot in theroom, it was tough to live there; I would just sleep outside.[122]Human Rights Watch observed several talibés sleepingon the street in Dakar, Saint-Louis, and Thiès. As Idrissa C., 11, andother talibés expressed, however, sleeping outside was impossible duringsome parts of the year: “During the rainy season, we join the othersinside because it’s a little dryer than outside [under the covering]. It’sreally crowded and hot then though. It’s almost impossible to sleep.”[123]Yet inside is only a little better during the rainy season, which lasts fromJuly through September, as talibés from tens of daaras said that theshelters routinely leak, forcing them to sleep in water inside the daara.[124]In addition to the cold, the rain, and the hard ground,talibés often described suffering from exposure to mosquitoes. HumanRights Watch saw mosquito nets in only one of the daaras it visited, and a 2007study of begging children in Dakar found that only 6 percent slept undermosquito nets.[125]Already only allotted around six hours of sleep a night because of the demandsof begging and studying, the talibés are further deprived of sleep bythe conditions that leave them at the mercy of the elements.Marabouts interviewed by Human Rights Watch were keenlyaware of the problem; the overwhelming majority cited a lack of rooms as eitherthe most pressing or second most pressing issue they faced.[126]The second most cited problem, no less severe in terms of its effect on thetalibés’ health, is a lack of a water pump—meaning that thedaara must purchase water, often leading to shortages.[127]Compounding these difficult conditions, the vast majority oftalibés owned few pieces of clothing and one or no pairs of shoes. HumanRights Watch conducted interviews during Senegal’s four-month winter andalmost every talibé described having only a T-shirt and pants in whichto endure the nightly cold.[128]Several talibés said that the three-month rainy season was even worse:the brutally hot and humid days on the street, with frequent rain showers,combine to soak their clothes with sweat and rain, leaving them few or no otheroutfits to change into.[129]The few talibés who did describe having sufficient clothing all saidthat they had received none of it from their marabout.[130]With barely enough water for drinking in the daara, there is rarely enough leftover for talibés to wash their clothes, except very infrequently or withthe help of marraines or community centers.[131]Human Rights Watch documented cases from eightdaaras—representing over 15 percent of daaras from which talibéswere subject to in-depth interviews—in which the marabouts stole newclothing that the talibé had either been given or purchased for himself.While the traditional explanation for the talibés’ wearing ragsand not having new clothes is to teach humility, that justification is shown tobe hollow when every talibé who had clothing stolen said that themarabout gave the new clothing to his own children.[132]Several talibés described seeing their clothing on the marabout’schildren, including 13-year-old Moustafa F.:One time, after saving my money, I had enough to buy somenew clothes, because my two shirts were old and dirty. I bought them in the marketand brought them back to the daara, but the marabout took them from me and gavethem to his own son. He often wore one of my new shirts, and I had to keepwearing my old stuff.[133]Over 40 percent of the talibés interviewed reportedowning no shoes or sandals, a problem disproportionately weighted toward theyoungest talibés and shocking given that plastic sandals generally costless than 1,000 CFA ($2.17). Adama H., eight years old, told Human RightsWatch: “I begged without shoes on in the heat, it was very difficult. [Theground] was so hot sometimes. I hurt a lot.”[134]One medical professional who treats talibés told Human Rights Watch thatthe lack of shoes leads to cuts and other wounds on their feet, which oftenbecome infected.[135]The conditions in the daara, including overcrowding, lack ofsanitation, lack of protection from the harsh weather, and lack of clothing,violate the children’s right to an adequate standard of living for theirphysical and mental development, including the right to adequate housing, underthe CRC and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.[136]When a marabout willfully deprives a child of these basic needs, he is alsocommitting a criminal act under Senegal’s penal code.[137]Violationof the Rights to Food and Physical DevelopmentForced to beg for their meals despite in some cases bringinga considerable amount of rice to the daara, most talibés interviewed byHuman Rights Watch described suffering from extreme hunger on a daily basis,often eating at best one or two small meals a day, usually consisting of breadand rice. A 2007 report by UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank found that themajority of begging children in Dakar, including talibés, were observedto be malnourished, often severely.[138]In only one of the more than 100 daaras from which HumanRights Watch interviewed talibés did the marabout provide food for them.Indeed, Human Rights Watch interviewed talibés from some 15 residential daarasin Saint-Louis just after Tabaski, one of the most important religious andcultural holidays in Senegal, marked by a feast of roasted sheep, and all saidthat they received no food from the marabout that day—even in the daaraswhere the marabout had prepared one or multiple sheep for himself, his family,and sometimes others in the community.[139]Deprived of food by their de facto guardians, manytalibés are forced to beg in markets or door-to-door in neighborhoods totry to fulfill their daily nutritional needs. Many find specific families thatare willing to provide some regular assistance, but rarely is it sufficient. MoussaA., nine years old, told Human Rights Watch:The marabout does not give us anything from the rice wegive him every day.... There is a Peuhl family in the neighborhood that givesme rice at midday most days, sometimes with fish. They don’t give meanything for dinner though, so I have to beg. Sometimes I have trouble findingdinner, and I am very hungry when I can’t.[140]To help ensure that no one goes completely without food,talibés in many daaras have developed a survival strategy of poolingtheir food. Issa S., a seven-year-old talibé, told Human Rights Watch: “Weshare our food from begging with each other, so if someone is not able to findany, he will still be able to eat a little.”[141]Despite survival strategies, many talibés go hungry on an almost dailybasis. Mamadou S., eight years old, related: “It wasn’t easy tofind food; there were some days when I didn’t eat anything at all.”[142]Likewise, Lamine C., 12, recalled some days when he was so hungry that helooked through trash for food.[143]The minority of talibés that did receive three fullmeals a day generally told Human Rights Watch that they were provided by amarraine,or community godmother.[144]Even when talibés had marraines, however, marabouts’ demandssometimes kept them from receiving their meals. Several marraines interviewedby Human Rights Watch said that the talibés they fed occasionally missedmeals to beg so as to ensure that their quota was reached.[145]One marraine in Mbour said that a talibé she helped support did not comeon days after he was severely beaten, because the marabout refused to let himleave the daara for fear that his wounds would be seen by others.[146]Forced to beg for food and often extremely malnourished, thevast majority of talibés in urban centers are denied their rights tofood and physical development under the CRC and the African Children’sCharter—rights which the state, parents, and the marabout, as a de factoguardian, are failing to fulfill.[147]The Senegalese penal code likewise criminalizes the act of willfully deprivinga child of food and care in a way that impacts the child’s health,placing many marabouts in conflict with the law.[148]Violationof the Right to HealthAs a result of the long hours talibés spend on thestreet, the malnutrition they suffer from inadequate food, and the deplorableconditions in many daaras, nearly all talibés interviewed by HumanRights Watch described suffering from frequent illnesses. Although placed incharge of the talibés by parents—and seemingly in possession ofmoney from the proceeds of forced begging—only around 30 percent ofmarabouts in daaras from which children were interviewed provided medicalassistance to talibés. One medical professional who treats large numbersof talibés described their situation to Human Rights Watch as “veryprecarious in terms of their health.”[149]Over 90 percent of talibés interviewed describedhaving suffered from one or more diseases in the previous year,[150]with the most common problems being infected wounds; skin diseases; diarrhea;malaria; eye infections; severe headaches; fever; and fatigue.[151]One marabout said that several of his talibés had suffered from choleraduring the hot rainy season.[152]Humanitarian workers described how diseases, particularly conjunctivitis andskin ailments like scabies that often cover the talibés’ entirebodies, spread rapidly through the daaras given the close quarters and lack ofsanitation, leaving huge numbers of talibés in a daara sick at the sametime. Human Rights Watch visited tens of daaras in which it appeared that overhalf the children required treatment for visibly present symptoms ofconjunctivitis or skin disease.Approximately 70 percent of talibés interviewed toldHuman Rights Watch that when they fell sick, their marabout provided no fundswith which they could visit a clinic or purchase medicine, no matter how severethe illness was.[153]The account of Pape M., 13, was typical:When I was sick, I was never treated by the marabout. If wesaid that we were sick, the marabout would tell us to find medicines ourselves.So generally I would just suffer, try to sleep it off. I had skin diseases andmalaria several times, but diarrhea was the most frequent problem.[154]In a particularly egregious case, a group of some 10talibés from a large Dakar daara told Human Rights Watch that anongovernmental organization regularly provided their marabout with medicines, butrather than use the free medicines to treat the talibés, he sold themedicines for profit. When they fell ill, the marabout told them to use theirown money from begging to buy medicines. The talibés said that even whentheir companion suffered a broken leg from a car accident, the marabout toldthe group to collectively pay for the hospital visit and treatment with beggingproceeds.[155]Human Rights Watch interviewed three talibés whodescribed being beaten by their marabouts for having fallen ill, in order to “test”whether they were faking the illness. Birame N., 13, explained:When I first became sick, I still had to beg. The maraboutwould look at me and say, “No, you are not sick.” If I still wouldn’tgo out, he would beat me badly. He would say that he was seeing if I was trulysick or just faking.[156]In addition to failing to provide medical treatment andsometimes physically abusing talibés when they fall ill, most maraboutscontinue to require the talibés to beg for their quota, even when sick.Saliou M., 13, told Human Rights Watch:The rule was that if you could walk, you can beg. So evenwhen we were sick, so long as we could walk, we had to beg.[157]Many children are forced by their marabouts to make up thesum they would bring in from a days’ begging, once they are feelingbetter. Moussa A., nine, told Human Rights Watch:If I cannot beg because I am sick, I have to bring doubleanother day. Since that is not easy, I generally just beg when sick.[158]The few marabouts who did provide medicalassistance—including visits to the hospital for seriousillnesses—most often did so only after the sickness had become severe.[159]Moreover, several talibés said that they had to repay the marabout forwhat he had spent on their treatment. Amadou S.,10, explained:When I am sick, the marabout gives me money for medicine, buthe writes down how much he gives. Once we are healthy, we have to beg extra tobring back that amount in addition to the quota.[160]Forced to suffer through often severe illness, which in manycases could be prevented or treated relatively easily, children are denied theirrights to the highest attainable standards of health and the right to physicaldevelopment under international law.[161]The marabout, as de facto guardian, fails to provide the necessary livingconditions, and the state fails to protect the child’s health whenparents and the marabout have proven unable or unwilling to ensure the child’srights. In cases in which the deprivation of healthcare is willful, themarabout is likewise guilty of criminal neglect under Senegal’s penal code.[162]Senegal is a state party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights, which requires that for children, “work harmful to their moralsor health or dangerous to life or likely to hamper their normal developmentshould be punishable by law.”[163]Sexual AbuseSenegal is a conservativesociety in which discussions of sexual abuse are largely taboo. As a result,sexual abuse typically goes unreported, especially when both victim andperpetrator are male.[164]This conservatism has made it difficult to ascertain the prevalence of sexualabuse of boys living within the daaras, though research by Human Rights Watchand other groups suggests that the problem is very likely to be more widespreadthan the few cases that Human Rights Watch was able to document in interviewswith talibés.[165]Human Rights Watch documented three cases of sexual abusewithin the daaras, two of which were described by the victims themselves andone by a witness to an attack.[166]In each case the perpetrator was an older talibé, two of whom were alsoassistants to the marabout. Of the two victims, one said that there wasinappropriate touching on multiple occasions; the other was raped on oneoccasion.[167]Ndiaga Y., 13, still clearly affected by the abuse, explained to Human RightsWatch:When I first came to the daara, in 2006, a grandtalibé would take me away and touch me [sexually]. He forced me to do itto him too. It stopped when he left the daara several months later.[168]Ousmane B., 13, described to Human Rights Watch what hewitnessed:Several times when the marabout was gone, I saw one of the[assistant] Quranic teachers do something to another kid in the daara. While wewere sleeping, he came into the youngest boys’ room and pulled one of thetalibés outside. I was in the room, not far away. He started trying totake the talibé’s clothes off—the young talibéstruggled, and some of us made noise, and he got away. The teacher came againthe next night and took the young talibé farther away, and that time hedid not get away. He was too small. He told me what the older one did [malerape]. It was not the only time.[169]In all three cases, the marabout either lived in a houseseparate from the daara or was away from the daara at the time when the abusesoccurred.[170]None of the children informed the marabout about what happened for fear thatthe abuser would find out and retaliate. This fear demonstrates the need forstate authorities to create a more protective environment for victims to comeforward.In addition to sexual abuse inside the daara, humanitarianagencies identified a risk for sexual abuse posed to children who had run awayfrom an abusive marabout. In Mbour, Human Rights Watch was shown medicalrecords documenting multiple cases of male rape against three formertalibés, ages seven, eight, and 11, who had in 2008 run away separatelyfrom their daaras and were sleeping on a beach. According to a social workerfamiliar with the case, the children were separately and on several occasionsaccosted and raped by men armed with knives in the middle of the night.[171]Social workers in centers for vulnerable children in Dakar,Rufisque, and Saint-Louis had also collectively documented tens of cases ofsexual abuse against talibés in 2009, including cases in daaras and onthe street after children had run away.[172]Several personnel related that in the daaras the abuser was most often an oldertalibé.[173]According to one social worker, most cases on the street are committed by anolder Senegalese youth also living on the street, who appeared to the child tobe under the influence of alcohol or drugs.[174]The Convention on the Rights of the Child obligates statesparties to take all appropriate measures to protect children from sexual abuse.[175]In addition to directly improving protection in the daaras, the government mustaddress the current climate in Senegal, in which discussion of such acts istaboo, so that talibé victims feel more comfortable speaking about theabuse and are aware of state and non-state authorities who can provideprotection and psychosocial assistance. While most Dakar-based and Saint-Louis-basedSenegalese organizations have begun to document and discuss the problem ofsexual abuse, the taboo in other regions remains strong. When asked about casesof sexual abuse by Human Rights Watch, multiple senior officials of localhumanitarian groups noted for their admirable work responded with bewilderment,acknowledging that they had never asked male children about sexual abuse.[176]Denying Contact withFamilyMarabouts typically make little to no effort to facilitateperiodic contact between the talibés for whom they are responsible andtheir parents. Despite long distances between the daara and the talibé’svillage, the proliferation of mobile phones and network coverage into even moreisolated villages in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau should make periodic contactextremely easy.[177]However, Human Rights Watch found that the vast majority of talibés haveno contact with their families. In many cases, this lack of contact was adeliberate policy of the marabout.Fewer than 10 percent of talibés interviewed by HumanRights Watch had seen their parents since leaving home between several monthsto more than 10 years before. Even within the 10 percent, contact generally consistedof one visit by a parent over several years, or a return home for the Tabaskicelebration.[178]About 20 percent of talibés interviewed had spoken byphone with their family since leaving home, generally only on rare occasions.[179]Most talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch believed that theirmarabout knew their parents’ phone number—especially as manymarabouts are relatives or acquaintances from the talibés’ villageof origin—yet chose not to facilitate contact.Moreover, in about 15 percent of daaras, the lack ofcommunication was part of a conscious policy by the marabout, according totalibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch, enforced even if the childknew the parents’ mobile phone number and offered to pay for the creditwith extra earnings from begging. Oumar M., 11, told Human Rights Watch:My biggest problem is that the marabout refuses to let uscall our parents. I want to talk to them, and I know my mother’s number,but I don’t have a phone. Only the marabout does. I really want to talkto my family, but he says that it makes us want to go home when we talk to ourparents, so he forbids it.[180]Although marabouts consistently explained to Human RightsWatch that isolation from family is a way to help the child more effectivelymaster the Quran, interviews with many parents suggested that there may be amore malevolent motivation: the marabout’s desire to control information,so that the level of suffering and abuse in the daara is not conveyed back tothe family. Ansou B., a father from a village in northern Senegal who has twochildren studying in a Saint-Louis daara, described how he only receivesinformation about his children when the marabout comes back to the village: “Themarabout comes here often and he provides news. He tells me that my childrenare learning, that they are eating well, and that they are in good health. So Iknow they are well.”[181]While he believed this news, several families interviewed by Human Rights Watchnoted that a similar trust was betrayed when their children were returned byaid workers and the truth of the deplorable conditions was revealed.[182]One father related that despite several phone conversations regarding his son’swell-being, the marabout did not tell him that his son suffered a seriousinjury from a car accident while begging. When the father was informed of hischild’s injury by an extended family member in Dakar, the marabout liedand said it happened while his son was “playing around.”[183]Refusing to allow a talibé to speak to his family, aswell as deliberately providing misinformation about the child’s healthand well-being to the family, arguably violate the individual duty underarticle 29 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights “topreserve the harmonious development of the family and to work for the cohesion ...of the family.”[184]As noted by Professor Ndiaye at the Islamic Institute in Dakar, whatever valuethe traditional practice of separation and isolation served when the principalfocus was mastering the Quran, “the current environment does not allowfor this practice anymore.”[185]Denying the Right toPlayOn average, the talibés interviewed by Human RightsWatch spent 13 hours a day begging to fulfill their marabout’s quota, obtainingsufficient food for themselves, and studying the Quran. With their timeconsumed from the pre-dawn prayer until the late evening hours, talibésrarely have time to access forms of education that would equip them with basicskills, or for normal childhood activities and recreation, including the otherwiseubiquitous game of football. In some cases, they are even actively punished forplaying by their marabouts who view it as a distraction from begging.Out of the 73 in-depth interviews conducted withtalibés, only three reported that their marabout specifically allowedtime for leisure or recreation.[186]In addition, three marabouts told Human Rights Watch that they explicitly setaside time for recreation, understanding its benefit to studies, communityintegration, and quality of life.[187]For most of the talibés, any chance to play comes atthe expense of the hours spent begging, and so generally only occurs afterhaving met the daily quota. Fallou P., 11, explained:The kids in my daara used our extra money and bought afootball for when we finished begging. The marabout allowed us to play—aslong as we had the daily quota and studied well.[188]Some marabouts have gone even further by actively banningany form of leisure or recreation. Abdoulaye S., 11, told Human Rights Watch: “Themarabout did not allow us to even play football or anything else. He said, ‘Ifyou have the time to play, you have the time to beg. Go beg!’”[189]Similarly, Pape M., 13, said, “If we started to play, the marabout wouldtake out the electric cable and say, ‘If you continue, I will beat you.’”[190]While the violation of the right to play may seeminsignificant compared to the severe abuses committed against thetalibés, several of the talibés interviewed said that, for them,it was one of the worst transgressions of life in the daara. Lamine C., 12, toldHuman Rights Watch:If the marabout saw us playing, he would beat us. In theearly evening, almost every day, all the other neighborhood kids would be outplaying football, but we never could unless we were far away from the daara wherethe marabout could not see.[191]The denial of the right to play, an essential element in thehealthy development of a child and a guaranteed right under the CRC,[192]is the ultimate symbol that a talibé has no chance, nor right, to be achild.On the Run, on the StreetsUnfed by the marabout, untreated when sick, forced to worklong hours only to turn over money and rice to someone who uses almost none ofit for their benefit—and then beaten whenever they fail to reach thequota—hundreds, likely thousands, of talibés run away from daaraseach year. If found trying to run away by the marabout, the punishment is swiftand severe. If able to achieve their freedom, they often take up life on thestreets—generally shy of even 13 years of age—where they encounteran environment replete with drugs, violence, and criminality.Human Rights Watch interviewed 29 talibés who had runaway from their daaras, representing only a small fraction of the children whotry each year. Each former talibé interviewed by Human Rights Watchnoted that before he ran away, others had done the same.[193]Talibés living in one daara in Dakar with over 70 boys told Human RightsWatch that all of the children older than 12 or 13 had already run away.[194]Adama H., eight years old, similarly described:Sometimes talibés ran away in groups, sometimesalone. We went from 50 down to less than five. I stayed because my parents hadbrought me back when I tried to run away the first time. But then I ran awayagain—this time on the back of a garbage truck to go to Dakar. I couldn’tgo back home.[195]Precise figures on the number of runaways per year aredifficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, however the collective traffic ofrunaway talibés recorded in shelters and on the streets by humanitarianorganizations in Senegal leads Human Rights Watch to believe that the numberreaches more than 1,000.There are tens of shelters in Senegal that briefly housevulnerable children while staff work, often with the Ministry of Justice andthe International Organization of Migration (IOM), to return the child to hisparents. With the exception of Centre Ginddi, a shelter in Dakar run by theMinistry of Family, the children’s shelters are all run bynongovernmental groups, but registered with, and inspected by, the state.Centre Ginddi has the capacity to house approximately 60 children at once,whereas most non-state centers can house between 20 and 30 children. A HumanRights Watch researcher visited shelters for vulnerable children in Dakar,Rufisque, Saint-Louis, and Thiès, finding them all filled or nearlyfilled to capacity. Often, as many as 50 percent of the children at theseshelters were runaway talibés. On average, children at these centersstay for a few weeks to a few months, indicating a collective flow of hundredsof runaway talibés each year.In addition to figures from shelters in Senegal, groupsoperating in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau assist a number of runawaytalibés to return home to Guinea-Bissau. Two Bissau-Guinean humanitarianorganizations that operate shelters for former talibés—SOSTalibé Children (SOS Crianças Talibés) and Associationof the Friends of Children (Associação dos Amigos daCriança, AMIC) helped more than 430 former talibés in Senegalto return to their families in Guinea-Bissau in 2007-2008.[196]Although statistics somewhat overlap, the IOM reported having assisted 307victims of trafficking for “forced begging” between 2007 and 2009.[197]All of these figures are limited, however, to include only talibés thatsucceed both in running away and in finding centers to house them subsequent totheir flight. Many talibés return home on their own[198]and hundreds of others take up life on the streets, particularly in Dakar.Talibés appear to be running away in higher andhigher numbers. Moussa Sow, the head of an organization that works withvulnerable children in Rufisque, told Human Rights Watch that while runawaytalibés used to represent only 30 percent of the organization’scaseload, they are now closer to 50 percent.[199]Isabelle de Guillebon, the director of Samusocial Senegal, an organization thatprovides healthcare to street children, likewise stated that the organizationhas seen a clear rise in the number of runaway talibés on the street inthe past few years. A Samusocial social worker estimated there to be hundredsliving on Dakar’s streets alone.[200]Social workers delineate three principal categories ofrunaway talibés: those who are found by the marabout or a grandtalibé and returned to the daara; those who make it to a shelter; andthose who take up life on the street. While fear of corporal punishment forcesmany to leave, it is likely also a major reason why some talibés do notrun away. As severe as the beatings are for failing to bring the daily quota,the beatings inflicted when talibés try to run away and are then found aregenerally far worse. Assane B., 15, told Human Rights Watch:When the marabout found runaways, he would put them in aroom, strip them, and have four talibés hold each of the hands and feetof the runaway while he beat him. It was a very severe beating; every time hewould continue until you could see bad wounds on the body. It was only when heopened skin—sometimes multiple times—that he would stop.[201]Severe abuse was also documented when runaway talibéswere brought back to the daara by parents after successfully making it all theway home. One former talibé described:When talibés were returned by parents, the maraboutwould discuss things with the family, talk about the good conditions, thelearning. Then once the family left to go back home, the other Quranic teacherswould put the returned talibé in a room and beat him badly. Then for thenext few weeks a grand talibé would go with the returned talibéeverywhere to make sure he didn’t run away again.[202]Many talibés thus plan their escape, knowing exactlocations of shelters to reduce the possibility of being found and returned. AliouE., 11, recalled going directly to a Dakar shelter when he ran away during therainy season in 2008.[203]Djiby H., 12, fled his daara with two other talibés in December 2007,telling Human Rights Watch: “One of my companions knew about CentreGinddi, and we went directly there.”[204]Other talibés choose life on the streets—eitherwhile they figure out how to return home or simply to live theresemi-permanently—over the daara. One former talibé, tired of thebeatings in the daara and already returned once by his parents after havingfled, walked from Kaolack to Fatick (around 50 kilometers) before finding avehicle that was traveling to Dakar, where he took up residence on the streets.[205]Human Rights Watch interviewed talibés who had livedon the streets for periods ranging from two days to more than five years. Aformer talibé explained to Human Rights Watch the rationale of hisdecision:Truly, for me, I prefer the street. The oldesttalibés and the marabout push us to leave the daara. I slept outsidemost nights when I was at the daara anyway, which is not much different fromthe street. On the street, no one makes me bring back a fixed sum; I decide howmuch I beg and get to keep the money. No one beats me for not having enoughmoney. Life is not easy on the streets, but it’s better than in thedaara.[206]Three former talibés who had lived on the streets formonths and, in one case, years, described living in bands ranging from nine toover 40 youth—and described tens of similar bands throughout the regionof Dakar.[207]The children generally beg for survival, often posing as talibés toimprove their odds. Several admitted, however, that the dire conditions leadthem to steal in the market and from houses. The 27-year-old leader of onegroup of street children and youth explained the streets’ difficulties:There are lots of difficulties for us on thestreet—finding food, having a place to sleep, harassment by thepolice—but the biggest problem is drugs, particularly alcohol and guinze.When a new one joins, he is frequently initiated with alcohol, smoking, andguinze. After that it becomes really tough to break, the street becomes yourfixed residence.[208]Guinze, a Wolof term, is an industrial thinner that manystreet children soak their shirts in or place under their nostrils.[209]Of the more than 15 youth living on the street at one site near downtown Dakarvisited by Human Rights Watch, every youth but one was visibly on guinze. Thosewho take this drug often become violent, fighting each other with brokenbottles, at times leading to severe injuries.[210]One of the defining legacies of the present-day urban daarais the growing problem of street children;[211]talibés who run away and find themselves on the street are thrust into alife of drugs, theft, predatory behavior, and violence. Without a concerted andsustained effort by the state, religious leaders, families, and nongovernmentalorganizations, the numbers of street children will continue to grow.The Story of Laye B., an 18-Year-Old Former Talibé[212]I was born in the town of Dara Diolof [innorthwestern Senegal]. When I was five, my family sent me to a powerfulmarabout’s daara in Saint-Louis. Almost all of us slept outside underthe sky because there was no room for us in the daara. There were at least 60talibés.Each day, the marabout divided us into groups oftwo. We had to bring 350 CFA ($0.76), rice, and millet—all wereobligatory. Then, if one of the two of us found the sum, but the other onefailed, the marabout forced the one with the most money to beat theother—with electric cable laced with a strip of iron. If thetalibé refused, then the marabout himself would beat bothtalibés.I couldn’t handle it anymore, so my olderbrother came to get me. When he arrived, the marabout told him that I wasclose to finishing the Quran, so my brother left. I was not even halfwaythrough the Quran. It was then that I decided to run away. The first threetimes, a grand talibé trapped me and brought me back to the daara.With the marabout there, the grand talibé would lock me in a room allday and beat me; he would leave and then return to beat me again. Finally,there was a truck traveling to my aunt’s village, so I escaped.My parents said that they were going to send me backto the daara, so I ran away again, this time to Kaolack. From there, I fledto Mbour, where I begged for money to pay for a trip to Dakar.In Dakar, I’ve lived on and off the streetsfor the last six years. I begged to survive. During the rainy season, I sleptunder the overhang of a bank; otherwise I slept outside, where there wereother ex-talibés. I often had problems with people on thestreet—they would rob me while I was asleep and beat me. The police wouldfind us outside sometimes and take us to the police station for a coupledays.It’s because of begging—that is whythere are so many children on the streets. The marabouts need to understandthat it’s really difficult for us to have to bring the sum every day.Perpetrators and Complicitous ActorsHundreds of marabouts in Senegal subject talibésliving under their de facto guardianship to conditions akin to slavery. Theyforce the children to perform a worst form of child labor—begging on thestreets for long hours—and subject them to often brutal physical andpsychological abuse, all within a climate of fear. They are also responsiblefor gross negligence, failing to fulfill the children’s basic needs—includingfood, shelter, and healthcare—despite a presumption of adequateresources, brought in primarily by the children themselves. Senior religiousleaders have failed to subject exploitative marabouts to any kind of regulationor implement disciplinary measures.The governments of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, who bearultimate responsibility under national and international law for human rightsabuses within and at their borders, have failed to take effective action toprotect these children, including through punishing the perpetrators and preventingfuture abuse. In Senegal, the government has made next to no attempt tointroduce, much less enforce, regulation of the daaras, apparently allowing theanticipated political backlash from the brotherhoods to trump the welfare of tensof thousands of children. The government has likewise made almost no effort toenforce key laws and hold accountable marabouts who force children to beg orphysically abuse them. In Guinea-Bissau, the government has taken somemeaningful steps to prevent the large-scale trafficking of children to Senegal,but remains unwilling to hold accountable marabouts who are involved in thepractice. Moreover, the Bissau-Guinean government has largely ignored thegrowing problem of begging talibés in its own cities.Many parents who knowingly send their children into anabusive situation also bear responsibility for failing to adequately protecttheir children from harm. Lastly, humanitarian organizations, while attemptingto fill the protection gap left by the state, have sometimes incentivized theproliferation of unscrupulous marabouts and urban daaras where forced beggingis rampant.Marabouts and ReligiousLeadersMarabouts interviewed by Human Rights Watch oftenrationalized the practice of forced child begging with explanations that hardlywithstand reason. Some marabouts who hide behind these explanations ultimately standto gain considerable money from the talibés’ labor. Meanwhile,marabouts and religious leaders who take seriously their role as a religiousteacher have failed to publicly voice concern, much less take action to end theabuses.Justifications for Forced Begging: Food, Rent, HumilityEach of the some 30 marabouts interviewed by Human RightsWatch about why they force children under their care to beg gave one or more ofthree reasons: to provide for the talibés’ food; to pay the rentand related costs; and to teach humility. However, forced child begging aspracticed throughout Senegal is wholly inconsistent with each of these statedreasons.Every marabout interviewed by Human Rights Watch said thathe had too many talibés to be able to adequately feed them himself, sobegging was necessary to meet the daaras’ food needs. While this mayprovide for a collection of meals, it is wholly inconsistent with begging formoney. As noted above, Human Rights Watch interviewed children living in morethan 100 daaras and, with just one exception, none of the money or rice thetalibés collected was ever used for their food needs.A majority of marabouts also said that begging was necessaryto assist with the daara’s other costs, including rent. Aliou Seck, amarabout in Saint-Louis, explained: “Begging, in terms of the hours, ismostly so that the daara can survive—in order to pay the electricity, tobuy Quranic books, for medicines and shoes, and for soap to clean.”[213]But by occupying abandoned or partially constructed buildings, many maraboutsavoid having to pay rent in the first place. And, as demonstrated throughout thisreport, the clear majority of marabouts who force talibés to beg fail toprovide medical care, clothing, adequate shelter, or other basic needs.Even in daaras where marabouts do pay rent and cover othercosts, it is not the children’s responsibility—particularly througha worst form of child labor—to pay for the daara. This is all the more sogiven that most marabouts consciously chose to leave a village in which theyhad a house, separate children from families that could have been the primaryprovider of basic needs, and take them into a situation where these costsexist.Finally, a majority of marabouts claimed that begging isimportant for the talibé’s moral education, particularly to teachhumility. Masso Baldé, a marabout in Saint-Louis, explained: “Beggingis above all for humility—we need to give an education that is verydifficult. In order to truly learn the Quran, one must suffer. Begging is apart of that.”[214]While many marabouts profess the importance of teachinghumility, three times as many talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watchsaid that their marabout’s own children did not beg as those who saidthat they did.[215]Similarly, as detailed above, some marabouts take clothes from talibésand give them to their own children. In these cases, any argument that forcedbegging is necessary to inculcate humility appears incredibly hollow. Lastly,the collection of food from community families, combined with living inrelatively ascetic conditions and assisting with cultivation, was formerlysufficient to teach humility in the traditional daara—and remainssufficient in village daaras and some urban daaras throughout Senegal.If one accepts that asceticism and humility are importantcomponents of Quranic education, the teaching of these qualities still offersno justification, as many marabouts say, for the forced begging, daily quotas,and physical punishment for failing to bring the quota inflicted on thetalibés. As asserted by a Senegalese academic who has studied the daarasystem: “As we currently observe [the situation] in urban areas, begging doesnot represent an element of religious education.”[216]Unjustified by any of the marabouts’ explanations, thepractice of forced begging for money, particularly with an often brutallyenforced quota, can only be described as exploitation. Aliou Seydi, a maraboutin Kolda who has followed his father’s example by not having histalibés beg, explained:The teachings of Islam are completely contrary to sendingchildren on the street and forcing them to beg. They can work thefields—that teaches them a skill, teaches them hard work. But certainmarabouts have ignored this—they love the comfort, the money they receivefrom living off the backs of the children. That is the only explanation for howthe practice has become.[217]Mohamad Aliou Ba, Village Marabout in the Region of Kolda[218]A Quranic teacher since 1990, Mohamad Ba returnedfrom Dakar to his Kolda village in 1996, with the help of UNICEF. The daara,a well-made structure built by Ba, currently has 60 talibés—sixlive with families in surrounding villages and 54 reside at the daara. Threewomen in the village cook for the talibés in residence, and the costsare covered through the cultivation of millet, rice, and fruit.During the week, the children go to school from 8a.m. to 4 p.m., with a break for lunch and recreation. On the weekend, thetalibés combine Quranic studies with cultivation and prayer lessons.Only during the harvest period do children assist with cultivation onweekdays.On his own initiative, Ba “modernized”the daara. The talibés learn French in addition to Quranic and formalArabic studies. With a strong focus on studies, talibés master theQuran in three years, or in five years when combined with French and Arabicproficiency. When a talibé masters the Quran, Ba travels with thechild to his village, for the traditional test and celebration.In addition to providing greater assistance forvillage daaras, Ba recommends the creation of a “diploma for completingQuranic school, to show who has really mastered the Quran.”Mohamadou Sali Ba, a marabout in Saint-Louis, similarly feltthat exploitation through forced begging, as well as physical abuse in daaras, sharplyconflicted with the tenets of Islam:We are all under God, and it is necessary to respect theQuran and all human beings. I do not hit my students because that affects theirintelligence—they only think about being hit and they cannot study. Thesefalse marabouts, who exploit the children with long begging hours and beat themseverely, it makes me very angry. In the Quran, the Prophet teaches politenessand mutual respect. Those marabouts that do not act in accordance with thiscannot really serve themselves under the Quran.[219]From Ascetic to AffluentWhile Human Rights Watch is not in a position to determinethe origin of a given marabout’s apparent wealth, it is clear that somemeasure of many marabouts’ wealth is derived from the exploitation of talibés.At the least, the money obtained through forced begging is sufficient to providefor a considerably higher standard of care in the daara.Human Rights Watch visited more than 40 daaras in Senegal, observingthat many marabouts—including some who force talibés tobeg—live ascetic and relatively poor lives. Other marabouts—generallythose that demand higher quotas of money, rice, and sugar—appeared to useproceeds from forced begging for their personal benefit. Many talibés,fellow marabouts, and community members told Human Rights Watch that they knewmarabouts who owned multiple homes and enjoyed all available modern luxuries.In a country where 30 percent of the population lives onless than a dollar a day,[220]half of the population lives below the poverty line,[221]and the government pays the average primary school teacher a monthly wage ofaround 125,000 CFA ($272),[222]many marabouts have found a way to live comfortably through the exploitation ofchildren.While each daara is unique in terms of the number oftalibés and the quota imposed, below are calculations from four representativedaaras from which Human Rights Watch interviewed talibés:Proceeds of Forced ChildBegging:Sums Demanded by Marabouts in Four Representative Daaras[223]LocationNumber of TalibésDaily Quota per TalibéWeekly Demanded Total from TalibésMarabout’s Annual Demanded TotalThiès~20250 CFA, rice and sugar optional35,000 CFA ($76)1,820,000 CFA (~$4,000)Saint-Louis28300 CFA and ½ kg rice58,800 CFA ($128); 98 kg rice, worth 39,000 CFA($85)5,085,600 CFA (~$11,000)Dakar~60On Friday, 1,000 CFA;other days, 300 CFA;every day, 2 kg rice, and 20 morsels sugar168,000 CFA ($365); 840 kg rice, worth 336,000 CFA($730); and 8,400 sugar morsels, worth 28,000 CFA ($61)27,664,000 CFA (~$60,000)Guédiawaye150+On Friday, 750 CFA;Sunday, rest;other days, 500 CFA;every day but Sunday, 1 or 2 kg rice (dependent on age), sugar optional487,500 CFA ($1,060); 1,350 kg rice, worth 540,000CFA ($1,174)53,430,000 CFA(~$116,000)A former talibé from the daara in Dakar detailedabove, who had run away with four others because of frequent beatings, told HumanRights Watch that the marabout lived in a “nice” house separatefrom his daara in Dakar, and that he also had the largest house, which thetalibé had visited, within his and the surrounding villages inGuinea-Bissau—complete with fully installed electricity, multiplemotorbikes, and multiple televisions.[224]Indeed, talibés from several daaras told Human RightsWatch that they believed their marabouts were wealthy enough from theirexploitation to own multiple, often lavish homes, which the talibés had visited.[225]Human Rights Watch visited one daara with over 200 talibés in Guédiawaye,where the talibés lived crammed in an abandoned structure swarming withinsects and without water, windows, doors, or a toilet. A kilometer away, thedaara’s marabout, Malic Mane, had a house, visited by Human Rights Watch,but he more often resided in a second house in the Dakar suburb ofMbao—coming to the daara only once or twice a week according totalibés at the daara.[226]Several local organizations had informed the Ministry of Justice of the daara’ssqualid conditions in 2005, according to the director of one organization, butno action was taken.[227]Human Rights Watch scheduled two meetings with the marabout, but the maraboutfailed to honor the engagement.[228]Fellow marabouts and community members in Kolda, a region insouthern Senegal from which a disproportionate percentage of Senegalesetalibés and marabouts hail, cited wealth as relatively common. Onemarabout in Kolda stated:The practice of considerable money coming back from Dakardaaras is very common. There is a grand marabout here in Kolda who has sentstudents with a grand talibé to Dakar, and then money is sent back tohim here, which he lives off very comfortably. And there are many marabouts whouse the money from begging to build large homes and to control other buildings,here and in Guinea-Bissau.[229]A community member who has lived in the region of Kolda formore than 40 years likewise told Human Rights Watch:I know marabouts here who have big houses, cars, andmotorbikes, own multiple buildings, and who dress nicer than businessmen. Someof them live here currently; some have daaras elsewhere in the country. Italmost becomes a contest between them to have the most talibés.[230]Silent AcceptanceA number of marabouts and imams expressed indignation overthe proliferation of “faux-marabouts” and what they perceived to bethe prioritization of begging and money over the Quran in other daaras.However, few were willing to publically denounce the exploitation, press forgovernment regulation, or bring religious institutional pressure to bear onthose engaging in the practice.Mohamed Niass, a marabout and imam in Guédiawaye,told Human Rights Watch:The question about exploitation by marabouts is pertinent. Itis important for all of us to raise human rights and necessary to denounceexploitation. The Prophet commanded that we educate children, not exploit them....I see these problems, the children who beg all day and who do not have shoes orclothes, and it angers me.[231]Ibrahima Puye, a marabout in Guédiawaye, expressedconcern that the proliferation of forced begging would result in discreditingthe practice of Quranic education within Senegalese society:I know of the level of exploitation by some other marabouts,and it makes me angry ... [because] the result is that all marabouts are seenas the same. Some kids are on the street all day, because their marabouts donot care about education.... This must stop so that these faux-marabouts do notsully the name of all daaras.[232]Yet despite the anger expressed to Human Rights Watch, thesemarabouts, and hundreds of others who feel similarly, have yet to take action todemand regulation and accountability from the government or religioushierarchy.[233]In January 2010, the spokesperson for the Tijaniyya brotherhood voicedopposition to rampant forced begging; however, the statement was notaccompanied by concrete action.[234]Leaders of the other brotherhoods have yet to even publicly object to thepractice. As expressed by one Senegalese humanitarian worker, “If leadersof the two great brotherhoods in Senegal said ‘no more forced childbegging,’ there would be no more forced begging.”[235]In contrast to Senegal, religious authorities inGuinea-Bissau have begun to speak out against the practice of sending childrento daaras in Senegal. Alhadji Alonso Faty, the first vice-president of the HighIslamic Council (Conselho Superior Islâmico) in Guinea-Bissau, wasone of a half dozen religious leaders who took part in a commission thatinvestigated the conditions of talibés in Senegal, which he said shockedand “revolted” him and his colleagues.[236]The commission presented their findings on national television and urged parentsto keep their children in Guinea-Bissau. The president of the NationalCommunity of Islamic Youth (Comunidade Nacional da JuventudeIslâmica,CNJI) said that her organization had worked closely with imams in Bissau andcited as concrete results the discussion of sending children to Senegal duringthe Friday prayer and on radio broadcasts.[237]The head imam in Bafatá, the second-largest city in Guinea-Bissau, toldHuman Rights Watch that he had publicly expressed his opposition to sendingchildren to Senegal and advised families against it.[238]Despite these efforts, marabouts continue to bring hundreds,likely thousands, of children from Guinea-Bissau into Senegal each year. TheCNJI president acknowledged that sensitization efforts were mostly concentratedin the capital of Bissau and its surroundings, while the vast majority ofcross-border movement takes place in the regions of Bafatá andGabú, in the east.[239]More importantly, all of these religious leaders expressed that, even in thecase of child trafficking, they were reluctant to involve the state and pressfor criminal charges to be brought against perpetrators.Government of SenegalThe state is the primary entity responsible for protectingthe rights of children within its borders, something which the government ofSenegal has failed to do with respect to tens of thousands of talibés.In 2007, the government established the Partnership for the Withdrawal andReinsertion of Street Children (Partenariat pour le Retrait et laRéinsertion des Enfants de la Rue, PARRER), a coordinating body of governmentministries, civil society, religious groups, and aid agencies to help addressthe problem of street children, including the talibés. While PARRER hascommissioned and undertaken studies on the number of begging children inSenegal and effective response strategies, it focuses, as its president toldHuman Rights Watch, “not on the government, [but] on prevention andbuilding social mobilization.”[240]In January 2010, the state signed a 23 million CFA ($50,000) partnership withPARRER, for the coordinating body to continue prevention work.[241]While improved funding to remove children from the streetand to sensitize parents is noteworthy, the government continues to neglectother, crucially important responses that could serve as a deterrent. Centralto the widespread neglect and abuse of the talibés is the government’sfailure to inspect and regulate the daaras and to require that children accessa well-rounded education, much less investigate and prosecute marabouts engagedin the abuse and exploitation of children.Lack of RegulationWith the exception of a few modern daaras, none of theQuranic schools in Senegal are subject to any form of government regulation, beit regarding the curriculum, living conditions, or standards of health. Thegovernment does not require registration of the daara or the children in thedaara, nor are there requirements regarding hours of learning; subjects taught;teacher qualifications; student-to-teacher ratio; the quality of the structurewhere children live and learn; or provision of clean water, nutrition, andhealthcare.Not surprisingly, this has allowed for the proliferation ofdaaras and marabouts, including those who appear to have little interest ineducating children. The government’s failure to regulate the daaras hascontributed to every human rights abuse endured by the talibésdocumented in this report. It can only begin to protect these children if it isenacts legislation to register and regulate all daaras, creating adequatemechanisms to monitor compliance, and then exercise its power to close daarasin which children are forced to beg, brutalized, and subjected to conditions thatendanger their education and health.The need for regulation has long been discussed bySenegalese government officials, the diplomatic community, and aid agencies.Various ministries, particularly the Ministry of Education, have hosted andattended tens of conferences, seminars, and workshops on Quranic education inSenegal.[242]In 2004, the Daara Inspection Directorate was established within the Ministryof Education; however, the unit did not become operational until 2008.Furthermore, its mandate is very limited: the daaras subject to inspection are “modern”daaras.[243]Traditional daaras and urban residential daaras—which one inspector referredto as “daaras outside the law”—are not overseen.[244]Expansion plans for modern daaras, discussed below, will increase the number ofdaaras subject to regulation, but will still not impact government oversightover the daaras that are the subject of this report. While the governmentformally recognized all Quranic schools in February 2010, recognition was notcoupled with regulation.[245]As a result, it is precisely the daaras most prominently associated withexploitation and abuse that remain outside of the state’s regulatoryreach.As long ago as 1978, a seminar at the Islamic Institute inDakar, attended by high-level officials of the Ministry of Education,[246]recommended that Quranic school teachers should meet well-defined professionalcriteria; that pedagogy should be established; and that there should be requirementsfor opening and operating daaras.[247]However, when interviewed by Human Rights Watch, one high-level official in theMinistry of Family stated: “It is impossible for the state to regulateimmediately. It must first gain the marabouts’ trust [and] reflectfurther on the institution of daaras.”[248]Three decades after leading Islamic authorities in Senegal led a call forregulation to eliminate the then-newly burgeoning exploitation of children, thegovernment still professes a need to further study the issue—now withtens of thousands of children affected.Eschewing AccountabilityState authorities in Senegal have also failed to investigateand hold accountable marabouts implicated in abuse and neglect. In 2005, thegovernment passed a law that criminalized forcing another into begging forfinancial gain, under penalty of a large fine and imprisonment for between twoand five years.[249]Five years later, no government official interviewed by Human Rights Watch couldidentify a single instance when the law was applied to sanction a maraboutsolely for the practice of forced begging.One high-level official in the Directorate for theProtection of Children’s Rights, within the Ministry of Family, explainedto Human Rights Watch the two choices the state has identified to address forcedchild begging:Either the state applies the [anti-forced begging] law withrigor—and is in a situation where it arrests hundreds, perhaps thousandsof marabouts—or the state works with some marabouts, who can then look atothers and say, “It’s not like this, it’s like this.” Wehave chosen the second option, because otherwise too large a number would beimplicated; it is just not possible or optimal.[250]It is not clear why these are the only two options. Aninfluential assemblywoman, who disagreed with the state’s reluctance, notedthat the state could hold accountable the most exploitative or abusivemarabouts through imprisonment and fines, and use alternative sanctions likepublic shaming for others. Most importantly, she noted, the state is obligatedto take the children out of the abusive environment and return them to theirfamilies.[251]Indeed, determining the most exploitative marabouts requires only simpleinterviews with talibés who are begging outside of their daara, todetermine the quota and the punishment for failing to bring the quota.Beyond failing to punish marabouts for forced begging, stateauthorities have demonstrated a reluctance to launch and follow through withcriminal proceedings, even when marabouts engage in excessive physical abuseagainst talibés. In the few cases that have resulted in sentencing,judges have only imposed short prison terms. Article 298 of the penal codestates that anyone who voluntarily injures or strikes a child under 15 years ofage, excluding “minor assaults,” shall be punished withimprisonment and a fine. The findings in this report demonstrate that manymarabouts abuse their talibés in a manner far beyond a “minorassault.” Yet for each year between 2005 and 2009, fewer than fivearrests of marabouts were made for physical abuse against talibés.[252]Government officials with the Ministry of Justice in Mbour and Kolda said thatthey could not remember a single case in which a marabout was brought beforethe tribunal for physically abusing a talibé.[253]Cases resulting in criminal proceedings and punishment havealmost exclusively been those in which a talibé was beaten to death ornear-death. A marabout who beat a talibé to death was sentenced to fouryears imprisonment in 2007; and a marabout who beat a talibé tonear-death in 2008 was sentenced to three years in prison.[254]One of the few cases in which the perpetrator received a substantial punishmentwas in 2008, when an assistant Quranic teacher was sentenced to life in prison fortorturing and gruesomely suffocating a talibé in his father’sdaara.[255]Fear of BacklashAs noted in the backgroundsection of this report, religious leaders wield enormous social, political, andeconomic power in Senegal. Almost every humanitarian worker and many governmentofficials interviewed by Human Rights Watch described how the brotherhoods’power underscores the government’s lack of political will to ensure thatrelevant ministry personnel—notably from the Ministries of Interior,Justice, and Education—both regulate and hold marabouts accountable forabuse and exploitation. One government official in the Ministry of Family toldHuman Rights Watch:The state has made efforts, but is very sensitive to theissue, particularly in terms of punishment. The grand marabouts—theleaders of the brotherhoods—this involves them, even if indirectly. Ifyou touch any of the marabouts, you touch the brotherhoods, and that is verydifficult here. You lose votes, maybe you lose office, and you face trouble.[256]One high-level government official told Human Rights Watchthat in 2005 she publicly pushed for the prosecution of a marabout who hadseverely beaten a three-year-old talibé. While the marabout ultimatelyreceived a two-year prison sentence, the government official received multipledeath threats by telephone. The official noted that her colleagues are afraidto take the same risks.[257]Similarly, an individual who runs a center for talibés in Mbourdescribed how she faced threats and ostracism from marabouts and the localcommunity for trying to press charges regarding the rape of a youngtalibé.[258]Social pressure, in addition to outright threats, reducesthe number of cases brought before the authorities. One man who dared to filecharges after his son was brutally beaten by a marabout was shunned by hisvillage and his own father, who told an Associated Press journalist: “[Thebeating] was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout....The day they took the marabout to prison, it hurt me so much it was as if theyhad come to jail me.”[259]While individuals may endure threats and social pressure fortaking action against marabouts, these concerns are no excuse for theSenegalese government, whose support could reduce reprisals. One governmentofficial in the Ministry of Justice expressed this sentiment to Human RightsWatch:There is a great fear of the grand marabouts, but why? Thisis a law about child protection. It is necessary to apply the text of thelaw—poverty and religion are not excuses for throwing a child on thestreet, for making money off a child.[260]Assistance for Religious EducationMany parents refuse to send their children to state schools dueto the curriculum’s lack of Quranic instruction and the imposition ofinformal school fees. In recognition of the former, in 2004 the governmentamended the education law to allow for religious instruction in state schools.[261]The government has also built state-funded “modern” daaras in whichQuranic studies are combined with Arabic, French, and subjects such as mathematicsand science. With funding assistance from international partners, the Ministryof Education in 2010 began the construction of modern daaras to number 100 by2012, each of which will accommodate around 300 students. According to the plan,the state will establish and regulate the curriculum, teacher training andstandards, and health and safety requirements. The schools will be subjected toinspection by state officials and, if they fail to meet standards, can be orderedto close. According to the Ministry of Education, this will satisfy the state’sresponsibility regarding universal primary education for these children, whileaccommodating parental preferences.[262]While the initiative shows many promising attributes, it isnot a solution for the vast majority of exploited talibés. As noted by aninspector in the Ministry of Education, more than 1,600 daaras have alreadyapplied to be chosen as one of the 100 to “modernize.”[263]Moreover, those marabouts interested in personal financial gain at the expenseof education are unlikely to apply in the first place, because they can reapfar greater profits than a state-employed teacher. The result is that while theright to education will be extended to an important number of children, theimpact on the tens of thousands of talibés toiling on the streets willbe minimal. Their daaras will remain unregulated under current government plans,and additional daaras “outside the law” will very likely be opened.Plans to expand modern daaras must be paralleled withefforts to ensure that state education is accessible and attractive to childrenand parents, as well as a determined effort by state authorities to closedaaras marked by exploitation and abuse and sanction those who have committedor allowed such abuse. Addressing the widespread exploitation and abuse ofchildren cannot be postponed during the decades it will take to extend “modernization”to the vast majority of daaras in Senegal.Lack of Coherent ResponseA final problem that has plagued the Senegalese governmentis its diffuse and uncoordinated response to the exploitation oftalibés. Multiple officials from national and internationalorganizations told Human Rights Watch that a major impediment to effectivestate action is that the government response is spread over the Ministries ofFamily, Education, Justice, Interior, Social Affairs, and even Foreign Affairswith respect to Guinea-Bissau—not to mention dozens of directorates withinthese ministries—without a clear leader. Officials interviewed by HumanRights Watch felt that the response was at worst contradictory, but more oftensimply incoherent, with officials in one ministry unaware of other governmentinitiatives.[264]Given the gravity of the problem in Senegal, there is a need to identify oneofficial as a focal point to develop a coordinated strategy.Government ofGuinea-BissauWhile the government of Guinea-Bissau has taken somemeaningful steps to combat the illegal cross-border movement of talibésinto Senegal, efforts remain hesitant and marred by insufficient financing.Most importantly, the government has lacked the will to sanction marabouts whomove children across the border in a manner that violates domestic laws andinternational human rights norms. Furthermore, the Bissau-Guinean governmenthas largely ignored a burgeoning domestic problem of begging talibés.Underpinning both cross-border movement and forced begging is the government’sfailure to ensure the right to education for many children.Insufficient Action to AddressIllegal Cross-Border MigrationAfter decades of ignoring themass exodus of Bissau-Guinean children to daaras in Senegal, where thousandshave been abused and exploited, the government of Guinea-Bissau finally formeda National Committee to Fight against the Trafficking in Persons (NationalTrafficking Committee) in 2008 and acknowledged the severity of the problem.[265]Since then, the government has taken positive steps to reduce the illegalmovement of children to Senegal, including through training border guards andcivil police. Yet action remains limited and slow. The government has leftpolice woefully underfunded to combat the problem, has failed to criminalizechild trafficking, and has avoided accountability efforts.Border Efforts: Improving at Border Posts, Lacking ElsewhereThe National Trafficking Committee has conducted trainingfor civil and border police, and immigration and customs personnel, with somepositive results. The commissioner of the civil police force in Bafatá region,perhaps the principal departure point for marabouts and talibés, toldHuman Rights Watch that in 2007 and 2008, civil and border police stoppedaround 200 talibés at the border and returned them home. They alsoarrested nine individuals, either marabouts or someone tasked by the marabout,who were moving the children across the border.[266]In 2009, according to the commissioner and confirmed by the leading humanitarianorganization in the region, less trafficking through official posts resulted inthe police stopping fewer children and only arresting two marabouts.[267]While the commissioner felt that this reduction was in partdue to reduced overall illegal cross-border movement, he acknowledged that itwas also a result of “marabouts better hiding themselves and the childrenwhen they are going across.”[268]The police commissioner in Gabú further explained:There are different explanations for fewer captures. Thefirst is that trafficking has slowed. The second is that the people movingthese children have new methods. They used to go through the two official borderposts; now, they travel by hundreds of clandestine crossings. Instead of taking20 children, they take two or three. And they now cross at night, because theyknow that informers will disclose their location during the day.[269]Indeed, several children interviewed by Human Rights Watchdescribed crossing the border at night, and one recalled having to walk a longdistance with a grand talibé to pass the border clandestinely, beforebeing met by the marabout with a car in Senegal.[270]A senior police official also acknowledged that efforts tostop child trafficking through official posts remained hampered by bribe-takingofficials.[271]Moreover, a humanitarian organization director who assists in border policetrainings described receiving phone calls from border officials inquiring as towhether individuals could pass without children’s paperwork—suggestingboth the need for further police training, but also the improvements that haveled some to recognize a potential problem and seek guidance.[272]Police face their biggest problem in combating the illegalcross-border movement of children, however, from the lack of funding by theBissau-Guinean government. Police and border officials in Bafatá regiontold Human Rights Watch that they collectively had just one car and one motorbike;in Gabú, there was one car, one motorbike, and one bicycle. As Bafatá’spolice commissioner described, “If the car is on mission elsewhere, andwe receive a call about the movement of children across the border, we areimmobile—we cannot do anything.”[273]Lack of Legal Framework and AccountabilityThe lack of laws specifically criminalizing trafficking inGuinea-Bissau severely undermines efforts to reduce child trafficking, worsenedby a lack of accountability for marabouts who illegally move children intoSenegal.At this writing, there is no law in Guinea-Bissau that criminalizestrafficking, including child trafficking. There is, however, a draft law. Thegovernment focal person for the National Trafficking Committee, as well as aUNICEF child protection officer assisting on the issue, expressed optimism thatthe legislature would pass the law during the first half of 2010, but admittedthat the process has already been delayed several times.[274]At present, arrests are based on border requirements and violationsof penal code provisions including kidnapping and “abuse of confidence.”[275]Under Bissau-Guinean law, a non-parent taking a child across the border mustpresent a signed declaration from both parents indicating their approval and astated purpose.[276]Quranic school education is a legitimate purpose according to the law, but agovernment official said that both the parents and the marabout must state thatthe child will not beg and will not be beaten.[277]When these requirements are not met, the cross-border movement is illegal, and,according to the law, the marabout should be arrested and taken before atribunal.In practice, this rarely happens. Humanitarian officials whowork closely on the issue told Human Rights Watch that no case of a maraboutattempting to illegally move children across the border has gone all the waythrough trial, much less been judged and criminally punished.[278]While the humanitarian officials cited a lack of political will as the primaryexplanation, the state’s focal person on the National TraffickingCommittee cited the lack of legislation specifically sanctioning the practiceas the main impediment and assured: “When the [anti-trafficking] lawexists, it will be for everyone—marabouts will not be treated differentlythan anyone else. The law is the law, and the law will be applied to everyonethe same.”[279]Growing Forced Begging Problem in Guinea-BissauNumerous aid workers as well as representatives from UNICEFand the National Community of Islamic Youth told Human Rights Watch that theproblem of forced begging in Guinea-Bissau has risen dramatically within thelast five years, particularly in the capital.[280]The prevalence of tens of begging talibés, with a forced quota, wasconfirmed by Human Rights Watch in several cities, notably Bissau andGabú.[281]At present, the Bissau-Guinean government has failed to takeconcrete action to combat the rising problem. Unlike in Senegal, forced beggingis neither criminalized in domestic law nor defined as a worst form of childlabor.[282]The government’s principal response, according to multiple stateofficials, is sensitization against the practice of forced begging, combinedwith exploratory efforts into offering financial assistance for madrasas, theBissau-Guinean equivalent to modern daaras in Senegal.[283]Human Rights Watch urges the Bissau-Guinean government to look carefully at theexample of Senegal, where decades of “alternative solutions” and avoidingaccountability have served to embolden the perpetrators and resulted in ever-growingnumbers of victims.Denying the Right to EducationUnder Bissau-Guinean law, primary education should becompulsory and free, in accordance with international law. Yet when freeprimary education was introduced in the mid-2000s, the government wasunprepared for the enormous number of children who entered school for the firsttime. The state, recovering from a decade of instability, found itself unableto cover the costs of teachers, materials, and buildings. While the law prescribeseducation to be “free,” representatives of multiple organizationsworking on education issues with the government said that informal fees,including inscription and monthly fees, are widespread. The fees force manyparents to remove their children from state school and send them to a Quranicschool, in either Guinea-Bissau or Senegal, where parents were not responsiblefor any costs.[284]As a result of this and other barriers to accessing education, more than 60percent of children in Guinea-Bissau are not enrolled in state school.[285]Human Rights Watch interviewed eight children in twodifferent village residential daaras in Guinea-Bissau. Seven of the eight hadpreviously attended state school, combining regular school subjects withQuranic studies in their home village, until their parents could no longercover the state school fees. Six of the seven who were previously in stateschool said that both they and their parents would have preferred that theycontinue attending state school and Quranic school at home.[286]While the Bissau-Guinean government certainly faces financial constraints, itmust take positive steps toward the realization of the right to education.As in Senegal, many families in Guinea-Bissau emphasizereligious learning at least equally to, if not greater than, state schooleducation. For these families, the government should work with leading Islamicorganizations in Guinea-Bissau to regulate and standardize Quranic schools,with a view to ensure educational quality, adequate living conditions, and noexploitation.Although the project remains in its infancy, the Bissau-Guineangovernment has started to take steps toward this goal. In September 2009, thegovernment, under the direction of the Institute for the Development ofEducation (Instituto Nacional para o Desenvolvimento da EducaçaoNational, INDE), formulated an action plan for the integration of madrasas[287]into the national education system. The plan calls for a consistent curriculumand teacher standards, as well as state subsidies. While these principles havebeen clarified, ambiguities remain, including whether madrasas will bestand-alone schools with full state school curriculum, or an exclusivelyreligious school associated with a nearby state school. Moreover, as describedby several aid workers, it remains unclear how the government plans to fund theseinitiatives, since 60 percent of its children remain outside the educationsystem largely due to already inadequate funding.Parents Responsible forNeglect and AbuseParents’ treatment of the children they choose to sendhundreds of kilometers away to marabouts ranges from neglect to knowingcomplicity in abuse. In some cases, parents are indeed unaware of the abuseendured by their children—in part due to deliberate obfuscation by themarabout—but in others, they willingly send or return their children to asituation they know to be abusive.Parents interviewed by Human Rights Watch gave three primarymotivations for entrusting a child to a marabout. First, every parentinterviewed stressed their desire for the child to memorize the Quran. Second,many parents stated that they could not financially support the child, and thuschose to confide him to a marabout. Finally, some parents stated that themarabout “demanded” the child, and that since the marabout was anauthority figure—often an elder, respected relative or communitymember—they “could not say no.”In general, talibés in urban residential daaras originatefrom some of the poorest, rural regions of Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. In Koldaregion—from where the largest number of talibés in Senegalhail—the average household has less than a dollar a day (278 CFA, or US$0.60)to spend per person. Seventy-three percent of household expenditures arededicated to food, leaving 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, for healthand education.[288]Pressed financially, some parents send their children ostensibly to learn theQuran, but also to alleviate household expenditures. One father who sent threeof his nine children to learn the Quran told Human Rights Watch:I would prefer that my children stay by my side, but I didnot have the means to keep them all here.... It was for economic reasons that Isent them. When you confide a child to the marabout, the marabout is in chargeof food and clothing....[289]The president of a Senegalese organization that works tosensitize parents, communities, and religious leaders regarding children’srights in Islam and the risks of sending their children away, explained toHuman Rights Watch:There are a number of people directly responsible for thewell-being of these children who are not fulfilling their roles. Here is anexample. A father has two children—he sends one to French school and oneto Quranic school. For the child in French school, he takes care of food,healthcare, school fees, a place to sleep ... everything. For the child in Quranicschool, he takes care of nothing. He hands the child over to the marabout andthen takes no part in the child’s well-being. Why, in the name ofculture, is this okay?[290]Indeed, several parents interviewed by Human Rights Watchbelieved that they had no responsibilities once they confided their child tothe marabout. One father of two talibés said, “When I handed [mychildren] over to the marabout, I gave them to him. They are his responsibilitynow. If you have questions, you should go ask him—I do not have anyanswers.”[291]A mother in another village likewise said that she was no longer responsiblefor the child with a marabout, and that the researcher should speak with him.[292]The overwhelming number of talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch didnot want to leave their family and expressed mild to severe feelings ofabandonment, amplified by the fact that, despite the ease of mobile phonecommunication, they had not spoken with their parents since leaving thevillage.The Convention on the Rights of the Child assigns to parentsthe primary responsibility to ensure “within their abilities andfinancial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child’sdevelopment.”[293]At present, the parents of thousands of exploited and abused talibés arefailing to meet this obligation. These parents provide no assistance to themarabout for the child’s physical development and fail to maintaincontact to aid the child’s emotional development, much less monitor thechild’s welfare.In many cases, parents appear to be unaware of the severityof abuses that their children suffer or are likely to suffer in a daara. InHuman Rights Watch’s interviews with talibés, the marabout wasfrequently someone from the talibés’ village of origin; a relative,either a distant or close one; or someone from or with whom their fatherstudied the Quran. In very few cases was the marabout someone with whom theparents, particularly the father, had no prior contact. Parents therefore oftenbelieve that despite the existence of exploitative marabouts, their son’smarabout will focus on education.When children are returned to their villages by humanitarianorganizations after running away, some parents are shocked to hear of theirtreatment. A village chief in Kolda region who sent one of his nine children toa marabout in Dakar told Human Rights Watch:I was not satisfied with what happened when I sent my sonto Dakar. He did not master the Quran and he was tired from begging. Hesuffered a great deal there and then ran away. He hid for four years.... When Ispoke to the marabout, he made excuses—he said that my child had become abandit. It was another talibé who helped me find my child. I will notsend any more children to marabouts who have relocated to cities.[294]Malam Baio, the director of SOS Talibé Children inBafatá, Guinea-Bissau, created a video detailing the conditions andlevel of exploitation under which most talibés in Senegal’s citieslive, which he shows to village communities. He told Human Rights Watch that mostparents are appalled when presented with visual evidence of conditions indaaras. Notwithstanding, some of the same parents send their children to Dakardaaras anyway.[295]Many parents are indeed well aware that their childrensuffer neglect and abuse. Human Rights Watch interviewed many families who knewthat their children begged long hours, but justified it as necessary for themarabout to survive and pay rent.[296]In a recent study in Kolda region, 30 percent of families who had entrusted achild with a marabout believed that living conditions at the daara were indeed harsherfor the child than those at home.[297]In these cases, parents are not only implicated in neglect, but also complicit inabuse.Most egregious, however, some parents return runaway childrento a marabout known to be abusive. Human Rights Watch documented tens of casesin which this occurred; in some instances the parents even further beat thechild for having run away.Adama H. was seven years old in 2008 when he ran away fromhis daara in Mbour because of beatings and constant illness. He found his wayhome, where he told his parents about the abuse. His parents, particularly hisfather, decided immediately to return him to the daara. At merely eight yearsold, he fled again. Knowing that home was no refuge, he set out on foot towardDakar, 70 kilometers away. A driver eventually brought him to Dakar, where he livedon the street before a social worker found him. At a shelter for two monthswhen interviewed by Human Rights Watch, Adama said, “I want to go back home,but I am afraid, because I don’t want to be sent back to the marabout.”[298]Another former talibé, Seydou R., 13, told HumanRights Watch a similar story:I could not handle the beatings anymore, so I ran away. Thefirst time I made it home, but my parents brought me back to the daara. Idecided that if I ran away again, I would not go back home. The next two timesI was caught, and the marabout gave the worst beatings for trying to run away.When I finally succeeded, I walked by foot to Fatick, where I found a vehicleheading to Dakar and jumped on.[299]Unable to turn to his parents, Seydou traveled alone toDakar, at 12 years old, where he had lived on the street for eight months wheninterviewed by Human Rights Watch.[300]Even if parents can claim not knowing the exploitative conditions in daaraswhen first entrusting their child to a marabout, the decision to return a childto that situation once they are aware of the abuse without question makesparents complicit in the abuse.Humanitarian AidOrganizations: Incentivizing Urban Migration, Ignoring AccountabilityDozens of national and international humanitarian aid organizationsin Senegal provide a range of services to assist talibés and improveconditions in daaras. Many have done so for almost a decade. Forms ofassistance include provision of mats for sleeping; water; clothing and shoes;construction of shelters; food; bath soap, laundry detergent, and disinfectant;medicines or healthcare assistance; French classes; money to satisfy thetalibés quota; microcredit loans to marabouts to start businesses; andpayment of the marabout’s rent. Given the deplorable conditions in urbandaaras, the aid organizations’ efforts are certainly understandable, butthey have unintended consequences: by and large, they incentivize marabouts tocome to the cities—where begging is prevalent—and they reduce theresponsibility of the state, families, and religious authorities. Moreover,many marabouts continue to force their talibés to beg, thereby obtainingeven greater net income as the aid organizations help eliminate costs. In extremecases, marabouts sell the food and medicines they receive from aidorganizations. Many organizations have failed to halt assistance to marabouts whocontinue to exploit talibés under their care, much less report suchmarabouts to the authorities for abuse and neglect.Large-scale giving by aid organizations, with no stringsattached, encourages village marabouts to come to the cities, where theoverwhelming majority of assistance is provided. A marabout in a Kolda village describedthis enthusiasm to Human Rights Watch:Part of this [mass migration of marabouts to cities] isbecause on television programs, you see images of marabouts benefiting from NGOand state aid in Dakar. This motivates many marabouts to go to the cities, asthey think they will benefit.[301]Rather than assisting marabouts who remain in villages,where begging is almost nonexistent, most humanitarian assistance has had theeffect of pulling marabouts and their talibés to cities, where beggingis omnipresent. Several organizations, including UNICEF, Terre des Hommes, andIntermonde, are working with the Senegalese government’s project againstthe worst forms of child labor in order to return several urban daaras tovillages. Other groups, like ONG Gounass and Tostan, assist village daaras inparticular or community development more generally and encourage marabouts andfamilies to keep children in their villages. But the vast majority of moneyassisting daaras continues to be funneled into urban daaras, particularly inDakar region.Some marabouts appear to effectively use the assistance toreduce or eliminate their talibés’ begging hours and greatlyimprove the health conditions in the daara. Human Rights Watch visited severaldaaras supported by aid organizations where every child could be seen wearingclean clothes and shoes, there were blackboards and new books, and children didnot beg for more than food.[302]In other daaras, marabouts drastically reduced hours of begging and told HumanRights Watch that, with a little more assistance, they would stop forcingchildren to beg for money altogether.[303]However, according to interviews with talibés and aidagencies, many marabouts who receive assistance do not adjust the practice ofbegging at all, but merely use the assistance to obtain even greater net income.As detailed above, current talibés from one Dakar daara told HumanRights Watch that their marabout sold medicines given by an aid agency,requiring the talibés to pay for their own medicines through greaterhours of begging.[304]Moreover, several people who formerly assisted one international aidorganization expressed grave concerns about that organization’s decisionto support daaras through assistance including loans and paying the marabout’srent. They stated that although the organization told marabouts to ceaseforcing talibés to beg in return for the provisions, they routinely encounteredtalibés from these daaras begging on the street. Their opinion was thatthe organization was indeed “sustaining and encouraging the practice offaux-marabouts.”[305]Finally, one aid agency’s internal review of its three-year program—nolonger in existence—to assist scores of daaras acknowledged that somedaaras made no effort to either improve sanitation or reduce begging despiteconsiderable assistance provided.[306]The internal review noted that a serious shortcoming of itsprogram was the lack of consequences for marabouts who failed to demonstrateprogress in reducing the hours of begging.[307]Indeed, one employee told Human Rights Watch that when a marabout was caught forcingchildren to beg after the agreed-upon hours, the sole response was to put an “X”down in one of the organization’s records; no matter how many bad marksthe marabout received, the organization never ended its support, claiming thatit was trying to “build confidence among the marabouts.”[308]There is little doubt that significant assistance, with no serious efforts atconditioning the assistance or holding accountable those who abuse it, servesto encourage unscrupulous marabouts to start daaras and exploit children.UNICEF’s current position is not to directly supporturban daaras through material means, but rather to work with families,marabouts, and communities on prevention efforts to keep children in theirvillages and address the issue on a systemic level, including through assistingthe Ministry of Family to relocate several urban daaras to villages, improvingaccess to the public education system, and improving the financial standing offamilies and communities so that children are able to remain at home.[309]While most humanitarian organizations have not followed UNICEF’s lead byhalting direct assistance to urban daaras, they must take greater efforts toensure that assistance is not incentivizing the exploitation of moretalibés.Even when direct assistance improves daara conditions, theprograms are generally not sustainable over the long term, and diminish theresponsibility of marabouts, parents, religious institutions, and the state.The internal review of the same aid organization’s talibé program statedthat sustainability was the most significant obstacle it faced, acknowledgingthat once program funding ended and provisions to the marabouts accordingly ceased,most daaras returned to their pre-assistance state of begging and lack ofsanitation.[310]With tens of thousands of begging talibés in Senegal’s cities, aidagencies simply cannot finance a permanent end to exploitation. Indeed, giventhe continued rise in the number of talibés forced to beg on thestreets, such assistance has proved largely ineffective, and reduces theobviousness of the otherwise indisputable need for a government response to theproblem.Finally, while many international and national humanitarian organizationsplayed a crucial role in pressuring the Senegalese government to pass the 2005anti-trafficking law that criminalized forced begging, many have subsequently failedto insist on accountability or denounce the government’s utter failure toenforce the law. The humanitarian organization Samusocial Senegal stands out asan exemplary outlier, informing Human Rights Watch that its standard response whenmembers of its staff encounter a child who has been subject to physical abuseis to inform the authorities.[311]By contrast, directors of more than 10 humanitarian organizations working onthe talibé problem told Human Rights Watch that pressure foraccountability was at present unnecessary, counterproductive, or even a wasteof time because it had fallen on the state’s deaf ears for so long.[312]One director of a national organization went so far as to say that sanctionswould be unfair: “You cannot sanction someone who does not understand orknow why they are being sanctioned—that is what it would be tocriminalize or imprison most of the marabouts.”[313]International and national humanitarian organizations inSenegal and Guinea-Bissau have thus adopted an approach of so-called “constructiveengagement” and prevention toward the abuse and neglect inflicted by themarabouts. In so doing they have largely failed to report cases of abuse andneglect to the relevant authorities, much less demand accountability forabusive marabouts.For their part, UNICEF, in both Senegal and Guinea-Bissau,has contributed to addressing the abuses against the talibés over thelast decade. It has commissioned and led several studies on the prevalence ofchild begging in Senegal and on underlying reasons for child migration and confiage.It has, as discussed, also worked extensively on the protection of vulnerablechildren, including talibés, through prevention efforts. However, whileUNICEF’s country operations in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau have lobbied therespective governments to pass legislation against trafficking and forcedbegging, they have been hesitant to follow with sustained pressure to apply thelaws, particularly regarding prosecution and punishment for forcedbegging—a hesitancy that stems from concerns about damaging workingrelationships with government officials over this sensitive issue.[314]Human Rights Watch believes that as the preeminent child protection body,UNICEF must couple its noteworthy prevention work with sustained calls foraccountability, as the exploitation and abuse of the talibés will onlyend with both types of action.Ultimately, despite the efforts of many humanitarianorganizations and community associations, the phenomenon of beggingtalibés continues to grow. As the director of one large humanitarianorganization who formerly ran programs that directly assisted daaras, but whohas now shifted his strategy to relocating daaras back to the villages, toldHuman Rights Watch:Everyone is profiting from this status quo. InternationalNGOs have manipulated the situation and are receiving their funding. Nationalpartners are profiting, as they are funded for implementing programs. Maraboutsare profiting. Every NGO is doing something, but it is not clear howthey are helping given that the number of begging talibés continues torise. Everyone is profiting, everyone but the talibés.[315]Relevant International and National LawThe abuses perpetrated against the talibés representviolations of international and national law. The various abuses suffered bythe talibés qualify under international human rights law as a practicesimilar to slavery, a worst form of child labor, and, in hundreds if notthousands of cases per year, child trafficking. In addition, abuses suffered bythe talibés violate rights guaranteed in the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and theCairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam. Senegal has passed several laws toharmonize its domestic law with international human rights standards, but therehas been a complete lack of will to apply these laws.ChildServitude or SlaveryThe UN Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery,the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (SupplementaryConvention) defines practices similar to slavery as:Any institution or practice whereby a child ... isdelivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian toanother person ... with a view to the exploitation of the child ... [or] hislabour.[316]Children are routinely delivered by parents or guardians to amarabout. The central question is whether the practice involves “a viewto the exploitation of the child.” The use of “a view”in the definition indicates that exploitation need only be one of the purposesfor the child being delivered. As the evidence of abuses and concomitantbenefits for marabouts described in this report makes clear, exploitation iscertainly one of the marabout’s motivations when receiving the child inthe majority of urban residential daaras. Therefore, the threshold is met.[317]To combat these practices similar to slavery, theSupplementary Convention requires states parties to “take all practicableand necessary legislative and other measures to bring about progressively andas soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment of [these] institutionsand practices.”[318]Senegal has failed to take such measures to protect the talibés.Slavery, servitude, and forced labor are also prohibited byarticle 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.[319]Article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights prohibits“all forms of exploitation and degradation,” including slavery.[320]WorstForm of Child LaborArticle 3 of International Labour Organization (ILO)Convention 182 defines the worst forms of child labor to include:“(a) all forms of slavery or practices similar toslavery, such as ... forced or compulsory labour;...(d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in whichit is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.”[321]As discussed above, the practice of forcing children to begeasily qualifies as a practice similar to slavery. In addition, the work—whichrequires long hours on the street, puts children at risk of car accidents anddiseases, and often encourages stealing when a child cannot obtain the quota—qualifiesas a worst form of child labor under subsection (d).Senegal, a party to ILO Convention 182, has indeed definedthe practice of forced begging, including specific mention of forcingtalibés to beg, as a worst form of child labor.[322]However, the ILO’s Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventionsand Recommendations (CEACR), which oversees states parties’ compliancewith ILO conventions, including the Worst Forms Convention, noted in 2009Senegal’s failure to enforce its own legislation:[A]lthough the legislation is in conformity with the [WorstForms] Convention ... the phenomenon of child talibés remains a concernin practice. The Committee expresses concern at the use of these children forpurely economic purposes. It requests the Government to take the necessarymeasures to give effect to the national legislation on begging and to punishmarabouts who use children for purely economic purposes.[323]While the committee’s recommendation foraccountability is important, the committee’s language may leave manysituations that violate the Worst Forms Convention untouched. Few marabouts canbe said to use talibés for “purely”—if one definespurely as “only”—economic purposes, as there is generallysome, even if minute, educational purpose. At a minimum, accountability mustexist for marabouts who principally use talibés for economicpurposes or who, as the children’s de facto guardian by accepting theminto their care, fail to ensure that their most basic rights are fulfilled.In contrast to Senegal, the Bissau-Guinean government hasnot defined forced child begging as a worst form of child labor.ChildTraffickingThe United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol(Trafficking Protocol), article 3, states:(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouringor receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered “traffickingin persons”....[324]Under international law, threat, coercion, deception, andother means are not necessary to meet the threshold of trafficking when a childis involved. Every talibé interviewed by Human Rights Watch wastransported or received by the marabout. Therefore, to be defined astrafficking under the protocol, the marabout must receive the child “forthe purpose of exploitation.” In article 3(a), the Trafficking Protocoldefines exploitation as including, at a minimum, “practices similar toslavery”[325]—whichthe talibés’ situation has been shown to meet.However, as compared to the Supplementary Convention, whichrequired only “a view to exploitation,” the TraffickingProtocol’s requirement that the child’s movement be with “thepurpose of exploitation” appears to be a higher standard.[326]Even this threshold is almost certainly met in tens of cases documented byHuman Rights Watch, in which marabouts lied to family members to keep a childin the daara, brutalized talibés who tried to run away or asked to bereturned home, and deceived parents about the conditions in the daara. A strongcase can likewise be made that in daaras where marabouts impose the highestquotas and the longest hours of begging—largely neglecting Quraniceducation—the principal purpose is exploitation.The requirements for satisfying the child traffickingdefinition are therefore fully met in many cases, and largely met in others,leaving Human Rights Watch to conclude that there are hundreds, if notthousands, of cases of child trafficking by marabouts of talibés. Thesituation in some daaras, where begging is coupled with serious studies, ismore ambiguous under the Trafficking Protocol.CairoDeclaration on Human Rights in IslamThe Cairo Declaration, to which Senegal is a supporter,outlines human rights and related responsibilities deemed in line with theQuran and Sharia. Its provisions regarding education and exploitation wouldappear to interpret the abuses endured by talibés as counter to thetenets of Islam:Article 7(a) affirms that “every child has rightsdue from the parents, the society and the state to be accorded proper ...education and material, hygienic and moral care.”[327]For many talibés, the lack of food and healthcare provisions, evenwhen extremely sick, represent a denial of this right.Article 7(b) affords parents the right to choose the formof education for their children, so long as they take into considerationthe child’s best interests,[328]but article 9(b) states that “Every human being has a right toreceive both religious and worldly education.”[329]At present, a number of Senegalese children are failing to receive eithera religious or worldly education, but merely spend long hours begging onthe streets.Article 11 explicitly forbids the oppression andexploitation of others.[330]International Treaties onChildren’s RightsThe Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and theAfrican Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (AfricanChildren’s Charter) lay out the principal responsibilities of theSenegalese and Bissau-Guinean governments under international law in protectingand fulfilling the rights of the child.The Senegalese government is clearly violating itsobligations under the CRC with respect to at least some talibés’rights to life,[331]health,[332]physical and mental development,[333]education,[334]recreation and leisure,[335]protection from economic exploitation,[336]and protection from sexual abuse.[337]Article 19 of the CRC also requires the state to protect thechild from “all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse,neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexualabuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other personwho has the care of the child (emphasis added).[338]General Comment No. 8 by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the bodyresponsible for interpreting the convention, made clear that the requirementsoutlined in article 19 apply to corporal punishment in all settings, includingschools.[339]As outlined in this report, the physical abuse that many marabouts inflict ontalibés is severe and is unquestionably a violation under article 19. Thestate has an obligation to protect these talibés, including throughimproved legislation, regulation of the daaras, and accountability.[340]As well as including provisions similar to those in the CRC,the African Children’s Charter includes several important additionalprovisions:Article 29 requires states to take “all appropriatemeasures to prevent” the trafficking of children and “the useof children in all forms of begging.”[341]Article 21 calls on states to take “all appropriatemeasures to eliminate harmful social and cultural practices” thataffect the well-being and development of the child, focusing particularlyon those “prejudicial to the health or life of the child.”[342]The practice of Quranic education—or even boarding a child in adaara—is not in itself harmful; indeed, the modern practice oftenmarked by exploitation is far removed from the traditional culturalpractice. However, this article makes clear that the Senegalese andBissau-Guinean governments cannot hide behind the “cultural” natureof the practice when they fail to act.Article 20 defines the duties of parents toward theirchildren, including: “(a) to ensure that the best interests of thechild are their basic concern at all times; [and] (b) to secure, withintheir abilities and financial capacities, conditions of living necessaryto the child’s development.”[343]The CRC, African Children’s Charter, and theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights all containprovisions requiring states parties to ensure that education leads to the fulldevelopment of the child.[344]Finally, article 29 of the African Charter on Human andPeoples’ Rights states, “The individual shall ... have the duty ...to preserve the harmonious development of the family and to work for thecohesion and respect of the family.”[345]When marabouts forbid talibés to have contact with their families, orwhen marabouts lie to families regarding the well-being of their children, theyviolate this duty.DomesticLegislation Relevant to the TalibésSeveral Senegalese laws are likewise relevant to theprotection of the talibés, including those governing forced begging, trafficking,abuse, and neglect.Anti-Trafficking LawIn 2005, the Senegalese government passed Law No. 2005-06,which outlawed the practice of forced begging. Article 3 of the law states:Whosoever organizes the begging of another in order tobenefit, or hires, leads, or deceives a person in order to engage him inbegging or to exercise pressure on him to beg ... will be punished by imprisonmentof 2 to 5 years and a fine of 500,000 to 2,000,000 francs [US$1,160 to $4,350]. Theexecution of the sentence will not be stayed when the crime is committedagainst a minor....[346]The marabouts of almost all the talibés interviewedby Human Rights Watch are forcing children to beg for their financial gain. At thetime of this writing, the Senegalese government has failed to punish a singlemarabout for violating the provisions of this law, despite its daily occurrencein cities across Senegal.In addition to criminalizing forced begging, the 2005 lawformally harmonized Senegalese domestic law with the Trafficking Protocol and madetrafficking punishable by imprisonment of between 5 to 10 years and a fine of 5to 20 million francs ($11,630 to $46,520).[347]Senegalese Penal CodeProvisionsArticle 298 of the Senegalese penal code criminalizesphysical abuse and willful neglect of children, stating:Whosoever willfully injures or beats a child under the ageof 15, or who willfully deprives a child of food or care as to endanger hishealth, or who commits against a child any violence or assault, except minorassaults, will be punished by imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of25,000 to 200,000 francs ($54 to $435).[348]The penal code prescribes a heightened penalty—up to 10years imprisonment—if the abuser is a parent or any other person havingauthority over the child or acting as the child’s guardian.[349]Marabouts, as de facto guardians, would qualify under this elevated standard.While the penal code exempts “minor assaults,” the vast majority ofmarabouts described in this report perpetrate physical abuses that cannot beconsidered minor. The abuse inflicts severe physical harm, as well as terror,on the children, the vast majority of whom are under 15 years old and thereforecovered under the statute. Neglect, through the willful deprivation of food orcare, is likewise a common occurrence in many urban residential daaras asdocumented in this report.AcknowledgementsThis report was researched and authored by Matthew Wells, afellow in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch.

In teaching Arabic, the school gradually replacedreligious texts with literary texts, with the goal of “secularizingMuslim education.” Ibid., p. 172.[40]Ibid., p. 198.[41]Ibid., p. 202 (citing Order no. 2541, Administrative Code of French WestAfrica, August 22, 1945).[42]Ndiaye, L’Enseignement arabo-islamique au Sénégal, pp.11, 237-38; Human Rights Watch interview with the director of a localhumanitarian organization and shelter for vulnerable children, November 6, 2009;and with Ousmane Diop, Quranic student in region hardest hit by drought duringperiod of mass exodus, Fouta Toro area, December 2, 2009; and Anti-SlaveryInternational, Begging for Change: Research findings and recommendations onforced child begging in Albania/Greece, India and Senegal, 2009, p. 16.[43]Ndiaye, L’Enseignement arabo-islamique au Sénégal, pp. 237-38, 270.[44] UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, Enfants mendiants dans larégion de Dakar, November 2007, p. 37.[45] Ndiaye, L’Enseignement arabo-islamique auSénégal, p. 270.[46]Ibid., p. 270. In 1997, the caliph of the Mourides, Serigne SaliouMbacké, closed all of the French schools in the city of Touba,protesting the lack of religious education.

Maison de la Gare is currently performing a census inSaint-Louis to determine how many talibés are forced to beg and how manyare not. From their substantial work at present, the organization’spresident said that those who are forced to beg clearly outnumber those who donot. Ibid.[54]Human Rights Watch interview with Isabelle de Guillebon, Dakar, November 10,2009.[55]Of the 139 current talibés interviewed by Human Rights Watch, theaverage and median ages were 10 years old, with a range from five to 19 years. Formertalibés who had run away from the daara were separated out from thesestatistics, as many have spent months or years in shelters or have returned totheir city or country of origin. Indeed, the average and median ages of the 29former talibés interviewed were 12 years old, with a range from seven to18 years. See also UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, Enfants mendiantsdans la région de Dakar, p. 36 (finding that around half of beggingtalibés in the region of Dakar were under 10 years old).[56]These figures come from the 73 in-depth interviews by Human Rights Watch withcurrent and former talibés. A number of the talibés interviewedbegan their Quranic studies in their village of origin—for a period rangingfrom several months to several years—before the decision was made to sendthem away from home. Given this report’s focus on the conditions andabuses against talibés in residential daaras in Senegal’s cities,the age here reflects the moment at which they began under the care of amarabout in a city daara. In another study, performed by a large researchinstitute, researchers similarly found that boys from Kolda region—perhapsthe region in Senegal from which the largest number of talibéshail—are sent to other parts of the country, particularly to study theQuran, at an average age of 7.1 years. Draft version of a study on Koldaregion, seen by Human Rights Watch (publication pending).[57]Prior to being interviewed, the talibés had spent an average of 3.4years in their daaras, though this period ranged from only one month to as manyas 12 years.[58]A 2007 study with a larger sample size found that, in the region of Dakar, 58percent of begging talibés were from Senegal, 30 percent were fromGuinea-Bissau, and 10 percent were from Guinea. UNICEF, the ILO, and the WorldBank, Enfants mendiants dans la région de Dakar, pp. 37-38.[59]Of those from Senegal, the largest numbers were from the regions of Kolda,Kaolack, and Diourbel. See also UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, Enfantsmendiants dans la région de Dakar, p. 37 (finding that 15 percent ofbegging talibés in Dakar were from Kolda region, 11 percent were fromKaolack region, 7 percent were from Thiès region, 7 percent were fromZiguinchor region, and 5 percent were from Diourbel region).[60]See also UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, Enfants mendiants dans larégion de Dakar, p. 39 (finding that 69 percent of beggingtalibés in Dakar were Peuhl, approximately 25 percent were Wolof, and 5percent were Serer).[61]Of those from Senegal, the largest numbers were from the regions of Saint-Louis(particularly from the Fouta Toro area), Matam, and Kolda.[62]Of those from Senegal, the largest numbers were from Kaolack, Thiès, andLouga.[63]A humanitarian worker at a shelter for runaway talibés in Mbour confirmedfrom his experience that the majority of talibés in Mbour come from theregions of Kaolack and Thiès in Senegal, followed by the Gambia andGuinea-Bissau. He said he encountered far more Wolof talibés in Mbourthan Peuhls.

Although it is difficult to fullyseparate the two forms of begging, since they often occur simultaneously,talibés said that they spend an average of just over five hours a daybegging for money, with the rest focused on meals. In their study, UNICEF, the ILO,and the World Bank found that talibé children spend an average of sixhours a day begging. It is unclear whether the study included begging for food,or simply for money, in its statistics. UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, Enfantsmendiants dans la région de Dakar, p. 41.[69]Some marabouts provide a pause, or break, on Sundays, but this is in asmall minority of daaras.[70]Some talibés when interviewed first said that there was no “fixedsum,” but when asked what happens if they brought nothing, they said thatthey were beaten. Human Rights Watch then asked these talibés whathappened if they returned progressively greater sums (for example between 300and 400 CFA), to which talibés responded that they would not be beaten.Human Rights Watch considers such circumstances to constitute a quota, or “fixedsum.” Only when a child said that there was absolutely no punishment forfailing to bring money was there deemed to be no quota. Of the 175talibés interviewed, only two said that their marabout did not forcethem to beg at all, and only three talibés who were forced to beg weredetermined to have no quota.[71]The minimum was 0 CFA with a maximum of 1,000 CFA during the week and 1,500 CFAon Friday.[72]United Nations, Millennium Development Goals Indicators: Senegal, http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx (accessedFebruary 4, 2010) (based on a 2005 government survey).[73]UN Data, Senegal, http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Senegal(accessed February 26, 2010).[74]Human Rights Watch interview with eight-year-old former talibé in Mbour,Mbour, December 14, 2009.

Indeed, 88 percent of current talibés interviewedindividually told Human Rights Watch that they were beaten for failing to meetthe quota, compared to only 64 percent of those interviewed in groups.Similarly, 86 percent of current talibés interviewed in centers, whichoffered complete privacy and security, described being beaten, compared to only71 percent of those interviewed on the street.[96]Human Rights Watch interview with 12-year-old talibé, Saint-Louis,December 1, 2009.

If I hesitated, hewould always hit me. When he did not beat me the first time, I had to find therest of the sum the next day, or I would be beaten.”).[97]The one former talibé who said the beatings occurred without themarabout’s knowledge told Human Rights Watch that the marabout lived over20 kilometers from the daara, in a suburb of Dakar, and therefore did not cometo the daara daily. The former talibé believed that it was the grandtalibés, not the marabout, who required the quota and beat them for notbringing it. However, after he and other young talibés told the maraboutwhat the grand talibés were doing, the grand talibés brutallybeat them once the marabout left—and continued to demand the quota. Theyoung talibés decided not to bring it up with the marabout again.

They also frequently assist with cleaning clothes and provide a place forthe talibé to wash himself. Many talibés also said that theirmarraines helped provide money when they fell sick and sometimes bought themclothes. Perhaps just as importantly, many marraines provide a strong emotionalconnection for talibés who are far from their families and often in anabusive situation. One marraine, who had helped the same talibé for fiveyears, said how the talibé comes over each evening to watch televisionwith her family while eating dinner, describing her relationship with him aslike another son. Another marraine, who leads the women’s communityorganization that established the marrainage program in one city, said that foryoung talibés particularly, marraines routinely check the child’sback for severe beatings, and, in some cases, report the problem to the police.Human Rights Watch interviews with a marraine, Guédiawaye, November 23,2009; and with a marraine, Mbour, December 14, 2009.[121]See also UNICEF, the ILO, and the World Bank, Enfants mendiants dans larégion de Dakar, p. 42 (finding that only 29 percent of beggingchildren in the region of Dakar had cover for the cold season).[122]Human Rights Watch interview with 12-year-old former talibé in Mbao (a Dakarsuburb), Mbour, December 21, 2009.
