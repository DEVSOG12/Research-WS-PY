If you work on weekends he wakes you up at 5 A.M..He calls you in the back where we take showers and beats you for a whole hour.When we go to the mess hall to eat we have to count, and he tells you to come see, then he calls you into the washroom and beats you up and another sergeant comes to beat you.It has only happened two times to me ... I would change EBR. [I would] fire all the workers cause they are just dirty. "New jacks" come in talking, and they beat them up for nothing.This boy at EBR with me, a guard broke his arm with a broom ... [there were] boys lying on the floor and the sarge picked up his chair and threw it at him and hit him.If you tell a counselor, all it's going to do is make it worse.2In March and May 1995, the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Project conducted an investigation in Louisiana into the conditions in which children3 are confined in that state, examining the human rights aspects of their incarceration.We found that substantial numbers of children in the state training institutions are regularly physically abused by guards, are kept in isolation for long periods of time, and are improperly restrained by handcuffs.The state of Louisiana is by most standards one of the poorest states in the U.S.It has one of the highest rates in the country of children living in poverty and children not in school or working.Large numbers of children, especially black children, are suspended from school each year, sometimes for the whole year.Louisiana also has one of the highest rates of incarceration among U.S. states.4Approximately 1,500 children are confined in secure correctional facilities each year.The circumstances which lead to their incarceration are not within the scope of this report, nor are due process problems, such as adequate representation of the children.Human Rights Watch confined its investigation to the conditions in which children are confined in the Louisiana institutions.In Louisiana all acts committed by a person over the age of seventeen are tried in adult court, but children over the age of fourteen may be waived by the district attorney into the adult court system for certain enumerated violent crimes.All other children between the ages of eleven and seventeen are under the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Children's Code5 and are adjudicated by special juvenile courts, or district and parish courts with original juvenile jurisdiction.Children under the age of eleven are not subject to criminal adjudication.Certain enumerated acts, such as first and second degree murder and aggravated rape, that are not waived into the adult court, carry the potential adjudication by the court of juvenile jurisdiction of a juvenile life sentence. Under a juvenile life sentence a child is committed to a correctional facility until the age of twenty-one for an act committed before the age of eighteen.That means that children between the ages of eleven and twenty-one are confined in the four post-adjudication correctional facilities.These four correctional facilities are currently operating under a Federal court stipulation and consent decree, described below, that governs population limits and staffing levels.During the course of its investigationsHuman Rights Watch conducted interviews with more than sixty children incarcerated in all four long-term secure juvenile facilities in the state.6In addition we spoke with lawyers, judges, staff of the juvenilefacilities, former and current Louisiana state government officials, private individuals working on contract in the juvenile justice system both in Louisiana and in the U.S. in general, and individuals employed at the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.During our first visit to Louisiana we visited two detention facilities and two state correctional facilities.At the correctional facilities we were not allowed to speak with children.After a substantial exchange of letters requesting permission to interview children we were given permission by the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections in Louisiana (DPSC) to visit all four of the secure correctional facilities, generally called Lousiana Training Institutes (LTI), and to speak with children incarcerated at those facilities.Human Rights Watch enjoyed a high level of cooperation from state government officials on its second visit to Louisiana and thereafter in its correspondence with the Secretary of the DPSC and his staff.We were able to interview children chosen by us from the roster of children housed at each facility.The interviews were conducted in private rooms separated by sight and sound from any staff at the facility.This report is in two parts.The first provides an overview of children in confinement. It outlines and describes the standards, both international and national, which apply to children in confinement, and the U.S. government's involvement in the juvenile justice system.The second section describes the conditions found at the four correctional facilities in the State.At the beginning of each sub-section of the second part of the report the relevant international standards will be referred to, and outlined briefly, to provide guidance in identifying violations of the standards.The international standards appear in full in the appendices to this report.One of the most disturbing findings made by the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Project in its investigation of the conditions in which children are confined in Louisiana was that physical abuse of the children is pervasive in the system of correctional facilities.Although there were complaints of physical abuse at all of the facilities, we received the most complaints about the East Baton Rouge-LTI(EBR-LTI).7Most of the children interviewed at EBR-LTI told us that they had either experienced or witnessed physical abuse.Many of the children interviewed were so inured to the physical abuse that they expected it as a matter of course.The problemis compounded by the fact that there is no functioning complaint system by which the children may bring these abuses to the attention of higher authorities.Human Rights Watch recommends that the physical abuse of the children be strictly prohibited and punished.Moreover, a functioning and effective complaint system should be instituted to enable the children to seek redress for instances of abuse.Another serious problem is in the area of discipline.The Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Project found that discipline is administered in an arbitrary manner. As punishment, children are often confined in isolation cells for substantial periods of time without access to reading materials, emerging from the cells only once a day to take a shower.This is contrary to both the substance and the purpose of the international standards and U.S. constitutional law which clearly require that isolation be used only where children pose an immediate threat to themselves or others and further state that the confinement of children is for the purpose of treatment, not punishment.There is also an excessive use of restraints.Handcuffs are used regularly to restrain children after a fight until they are placed in isolation.Furthermore, many of the children told us that they were beaten while handcuffed.Human Rights Watch recommends that the institutions stop the use of disciplinary isolation.Human Rights Watch further recommends that the use of restraints be prohibited except where all other control methods have been exhausted and have failed and only in order to prevent the children from hurting themselves or others.In response to the question,"what would you most like to change here?", virtually every child at all of the facilities, except for Bridge City-LTI, responded that they would like the guards to stop hitting them and that they would like more food.The inadequacy of the portions of food served to the children was alleged in almost all the interviews. Children consistently told us that they were hungry.Human Rights Watch recommends that the portions of food served to the children be increased.The physical conditions in which the children are confined offer no privacy.The children sleep in large dormitories and must take care of all their physical needs in full view of others.Human Rights Watch believes that the failure to accord the children even a small amount of privacy strips them of the basic sense of respect and dignity that is essential to their treatment and reintegration into society.Human Rights Watch recommends that the physical environment in which children are confined be changed so as to afford children privacy while using the toilet facilities.The common problem of overcrowding, and the sanitary and violence problems associated with overcrowding and inadequate staffing, generally do not exist at the Louisiana institutions.The juvenile institutions in Lousiana are governed by a Federalcourt ordered stipulation and consent decree which sets out maximum population limits, mandates staffing levels and requires compliance with all state health and fire rules.Human Rights Watch's detailed recommendations appear at the end of this report.2AN OVERVIEW OF CHILDREN IN CONFINEMENTINTERNATIONAL STANDARDSThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child8 (CRC) is the most important international document concerning children's rights.The CRC deals directly with confinement conditions in:section 37 which sets out the right to be free from torture and, when detained, to be treated with humanity.Other relevant provisions of the CRC that do not deal specifically with childen who are detained include: the right to maintain contact with parents, the right of free expression, the right to health and the right to education.Five other international documents are relevant to children in confinement:theU.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of Their Liberty (U.N. Rules);9 the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules);10 theU.N. Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (Riyadh Guidelines);11 the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Prisoners' Rules);12 and the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons Under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (Principles).13These standards, except for the Prisoners' Rules, have been recognized by the international community by adoption as General Assembly resolutions.The Prisoners' Rules were approved by the Economic and Social Council by resolutions in 1957 and 1977.The Prisoners' Rules and Principles are standards applicable to adults and incorporated by reference into the standards applicable to children.The adult standards are never more rigorous thanthose applicable to children and are frequently less onerous.14TheU.N. Rules, the Beijing Rules and the Riyadh Guidelines are applicable exclusively to children in the justice system.The first deals most thoroughly with conditions of confinement and will be referred to most often in the body of this report.All of the international standards stress throughout that children in confinement are entitled to rehabilitative treatment and that states are obliged to provide such treatment.The objective of the treatment is to facilitate a successful reintegration into society.Applicable international standards will be outlined at the beginning of each descriptive section in the second part of the report.The full texts of all of the standards pertaining specifically to children appear in the appendix to this report.U.S. STANDARDSWhen a government takes someone into its custody, it has an obligation to ensure that the conditions in which the person is confined do not violate the person's human rights and that, at the very least, minimal standards of decency are guaranteed.The U.S. federal government has not established standards for the treatment of children in confinement in the U.S.The U.S. courts have established standards under the United States Constitution.The eighth amendment to the United States Constitution protects adult prisoners from conditions that amount to "cruel and unusual punishment."Children are entitled to a higher standard of care, as they are not "convicted" of crimes.U.S. constitutional law protects incarcerated children from conditions that "amount to punishment"15 under thefourteenth Amendment.16Although children used to have a right to rehabilitation and treatment,17 the obligation to provide treatment has been overturned.Now children are only protected from "unreasonable restraint."There is no right to treatment, except to the extent that it is necessary to prevent unreasonable restraint.18The American Correctional Association (ACA) is the leading source of standards for juvenile and adult detention and correctional institutions in the U.S.The ACA describes itself as a "private, nonprofit organization that administer[s] the only national accreditation program for all components of adult and juvenile corrections."Its purpose is to "promote improvement in the management of correctional agencies through the administration of a voluntary accreditation program and the ongoing development and revision of relevant, useful standards."19Facilities in the corrections system apply to the ACA for accreditation and are subject to a lengthy application process which includes an on-site review of the facilities' compliance with the applicable standards.The accreditation is strictly voluntary.The standards are detailed.Many of the standards require facilities to develop policies regarding, for example, suicide prevention or medical emergency responses, but do not address the effectiveness of the implementation of those policies.All of the Louisiana state juvenile correctional facilities are ACA-accredited and the one private secure facility is required by its contract with the Department of Corrections to become accredited. The ACA standards do not comply in all regards with international law or U.S. constitutional law.20The OJJDP has granted funds to Abt Associates, Inc.to develop performance-based standards for institutions detaining juveniles.The project is in the preparatory stages.U.S. GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENTTwo departments within theU.S. Department of Justice are concerned with the conditions in which children in the justice system are confined.The first, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), was established in 1974 under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (the Act).21The mandate of the Act is extremely broad.Its stated purposes include: providing for evaluation of federally assisted juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs; developing national standards for the administration of juvenile justice; and assisting state and local governments in improving the administration of justice.States that are assisted under the formula grants program under the Act used to be monitored by the OJJDP to ensure that status offenders are not held in secure confinement and that children are not held with adults.Since the Reagan administration, compliance with these requirements has been verified essentially through self-reporting by the states.The reports of the states are not monitored by the OJJDP.22There is no general monitoring of the conditions in which children adjudicated delinquent are confined.The OJJDP itself has not established standards for the conditions in which children are confined.The Act does, however, prohibit the incarceration of status offenders23 in secure facilities and requires that children adjudicated as juveniles are not confined with adults.The office is authorized under the Act to make grants and to enter into technical assistance contracts.The funds are allocated on an annual basis among the states according to the relative population of children.In 1995 Louisiana will receive$1,128,000 from the OJJDP.In earlier years the allocation was less than one million dollars.An official with the state advisory group24 told Human Rights Watch that the funds allocated to Louisiana were never sufficient to enable the state to carry out the Act's mandates effectively.In an attempt tostreamline the efforts to carry out the Act's mandate, the state advisory group has determined that OJJDP funds will be used only for pre-adjudication programs or alternative programs, leaving all secure facilities to the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DPSC).The only funding given to the DPSC is an annual allocation of $25,000 for the parenting program at Monroe-LTI.This parenting program will be referred to in more detail in the section on education and programming below.InAugust 1994 the OJJDP published a research report commissioned by it and prepared by Abt Associates, Inc. entitled "Conditions of Confinement:Juvenile Detention and Corrections Facilities."The report set out the findings of a major research effort into the conditions in which juveniles are incarcerated around the U.S. In assessing the conditions Abt Associates, Inc. referred to five nationally recognized sets of standards, but used the ACA standards as its primary resource.25The report found substantial deficiencies in institutions around the country in the areas of living space, security, control of suicidal behavior and health care.In the area of living space the report found a systemic problem of overcrowding.The most serious security issues found were the high escape rate and the number of injuries from violence despite adequate staffing.Prevention of suicide planning was found to be uncoordinated and insufficient.Finally, in the area of health care, health screenings were not being done promptly after a child's commitment to a facility.The other areas investigated by the researchers were:food, clothing and hygiene, living accomodations, sanitation, fire and life safety, education, recreation, mental health services, access to the community and limits on staff discretion.The report found some deficiencies in all areas.The second department involved with the children in the justice system is the Civil Rights Division - Special Litigation Section, which operates under a mandate toenforce the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (Institutionalized Persons Act).26The Special Litigation Section also has the authority to enforce the right to special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)27 and has used that act to enforce educational rights of children with disabilities in confinement.However, most of the IDEA litigation is undertaken by private organizations and law firms at the instigation of the aggrieved individuals.Under the authority of the Institutionalized Persons Act, the Special Litigation Section is given the right to bring actions for equitable relief, such as injunctions and court orders, against any state or political subdivision of a state, or any official of the state, that is violating the constitutional rights of persons or any other federal laws protecting the rights of institutionalized persons.Essentially the act provides an enforcement mechanism for the constitutional rights of children in confinement outlined earlier. The mechanism appears to be under-used on behalf of children in confinement.The Department of Justice only uses its power responsively, bringing suits where there have been substantial complaints about a facility.One attorney with the Department of Justice told us that in her opinion the Department of Justice was ignoring children, partly because there was very little sympathy in the current and former administrations for prisoner's rights, in particular for child prisoners.Mark Soler, President of the Youth Law Center, described the Department of Justice's record on protecting confined children as "mixed" and said that "for years there have been problems with the follow through at the Department of Justice."283SECURE CONFINEMENT IN LOUISIANAThere are four secure correctional facilities for children in Louisiana.Correctional facilities house children between the ages of eleven and seventeen29 adjudicated as offenders and ordered by the court to be confined in a state facility.The state-run facilities are called the Louisiana Training Institutes (LTI).They are: the East Baton Rouge-LTI (EBR),30 Monroe-LTI and Bridge City-LTI.The EBR-LTI campus is also the site for the Juvenile Reception and Diagnostic Center (JRDC).All children in Louisiana subject to incarceration in an LTI, whether the institution is specified by the court or not, are sent first to JRDC.The average length of stay at JRDC is about four weeks.During that time the children are evaluated for mental and physical health, educational ability and risk factors, such as aggressivity, to determine where they should be most appropriately placed in the system.The LTI's are ostensibly designed to care for different classes of children.Bridge City-LTI is the least secure environment and is where the children who are considered emotionally fragile or who have displayed low aggressivity are generally sent.31The fourth facility that houses children for the state is the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth (TCCY).The facility is run by TransAmerican Development Associates, Inc. and was built on contract with the town of Tallulah.The location was chosen for economic development purposes.32The Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DPSC) pays a per diem for each child incarcerated at TCCY on behalf of the state. TCCY opened in November 1994.The racial composition of the children incarcerated at the institutions is predominantly African-American.On August 24, 1995, the percentage of African-American children at the institutions was as follows:EBR-LTI -84 percent;Monroe-LTI - 88 percent; Bridge City-LTI - 73 percent and TCCY - 80 percent.33The racial composition of the staff at the institutions is also predominantly African-American.On August 24, 1995, the percentage of African-American staff at the institutions was as follows: EBR-LTI -87 percent; Monroe-LTI - 69 percent; Bridge City-LTI - 83 percent and TCCY - 78 percent.34Conditions in the three LTI's are monitored under a Federal court order, administered by Judge Frank Polozola, in the United States District Court, Middle District of Louisiana.The court's order arose out of litigation started in 1971 surrounding the conditions at the Lousiana State Penitentiary at Angola.In 1981, the court extended its jurisdiction to include conditions in all state penitentiaries, parish prisons, and other penal institutions, including juvenile institutions.In 1983 the court set interim population levels for the five then existing juvenile institutions operated by the DPSC, pending a report by the DPSC on the conditions at the institutions.Finally, in 1984, the DPSC entered into a consent decree and stipulation with the court35 pursuant to which the DPSC agreed to maintain conditions, limitations and standards at the juvenile institutions under its supervision and control as set out by the court.The court set population limits and minimum staffing requirements for the institutions which could be modified only by application to the court.The court also required that the facilities comply with all applicable health and fire rules and any other regulations adopted pursuant to Louisiana law which affect the health and safety of offenders. Finally the court required that an annual reportbe submitted to it by each institution setting out the populations, staffing levels and the number of violent incidents in certain categories, including assaults and suicides.The court continues to exercise its jurisdiction over the juvenile institutions to the present time.A court-appointed expertmonitors the institutions, receiving complaints and reports on occurrences at the institutions.The conditions at TCCY are also monitored by Judge Polozola.The facility was opened pursuant to a stipulation and consent decree dated November 15, 1994, setting a population limit and requiring that TCCY begin the process of securing ACA accreditation.TCCY encountered significant problems maintaining control of the children housed at the facility during November and December.During the period from November 16, 1994, to December 29, 1994, there were eighty reports of assault incidents between the children.36As a result of the problems at TCCY the court declared a state of emergency at the facility on December 22, 1994, and has been closely monitoring the situation at TCCY since then.A motion by the DPSC to vacate the state of emergency was denied on June 22, 1995.PHYSICAL CONDITIONSThe U.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners set out detailed specifications of the physical environment in which children can be confined.These standards, although non-binding, have been recognized by the international community by adoption as General Assembly resolutions.They are an authoritative statement of the international community's agreement on the minimum standards that should be adhered to in the confinement of children by the state.Rules 27 to 37 of theU.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty deal specifically with the physical environment that should be created by facilities which detain children in the justice system.The U.N. Rules generally require that the physical environment promote health and human dignity and to that end the design of the facilities is to be in keeping with the rehabilitative aim of the juvenile justice system. The requirements call for small-scale facilities, and where possible facilities with no or minimal security measures.Closed facilities are required to be small enough to enable individualized treatment.Sleeping should be in small dormitories or individual rooms and sanitary installations should afford the children privacy.The right to privacy includes the basic right to the possession of personal effects.Children also have the right to wear their own clothing to the extent possible.Rule 60 of theU.N. Rules gives children the right to receive regular and frequent visits, at minimum once a month, but preferably once a week.Rule 61 of theU.N. Rules entitles children to write letters or telephone at least twice a week.Because U.S. constitutional law also protects children from conditions that amount to punishment, courts have found that children are entitled to greater privacy than adults. Some courts have required single rooms, other courts have set limits on the number who may be housed in a dorm and have required privacy in toilet areas.37The physical environment and conditions in each facility will be described below.East Baton Rouge-Louisiana Training InstituteThe East Baton Rouge-LTI38 has a court-approved capacity of 580.On the first day that Human Rights Watch visited the facility in March 1995, 496 boys and eighty-four girls were housed on the campus.EBR-LTI is the only institution that houses girls. On the first day Human Rights Watch was at the facility, nine of the eighty-four girls were pregnant.On the second day that Human Rights Watch visited in May 1995, the population count for the girls was eighty-three, seven of whom were pregnant. According to Superintendent Lewis at EBR-LTI, the average length of stay at the facility is seventeen months.In the JRDC it is four weeks, although an official with the DPSC told HRW that JRDC processing could be done in five days.39The facility is located outside of Baton Rouge, about a twenty-minute drive from the city.It is located on the edge of an industrial district; there is no visible residential district in the area.The grounds of the facility are enclosed by a high chain-link fence with intermediate size razor wire coiled on the top of the fence.There are large open green spaces interspersed throughout the campus, including an outdoor playing field.Thereare very few trees on the property .All of the buildings, except the building which houses the large indoor gymnasium, are either red or yellow brick.The gymnasium building appears to be grey aluminum siding.There are two condemned buildings on the grounds.The JRDC is located on the same campus, but is separated from the main campus by a chain-link fence.The physical environment at JRDC is virtually the same as the main campus; however, the children are not provided with any education and their recreational and work options are restricted.It is, therefore, more punitive to remain at JRDC for a longer period of time, and it denies children the right to be educated while confined.40The dormitories house between forty and fifty children.Each dormitory is in a separate brick building.The buildings are one or two stories high and have a sleeping room, a common room and a bathroom area.The common rooms are generally bare except for a television set, some chairs and on occasion some magazines or a deck of cards.The sleeping rooms are generally furnished with metal double-bunk beds with thin plastic-covered mattresses that run along the perimeter of the room, spaced approximately two and one-half feet apart.There are windows in the room.The children are provided with pillows and blankets, and HRW was told by staff that children are given fresh linen each day.There is a bathroom area adjacent to the sleeping room which has three showers and four toilets.None of these are enclosed to provide privacy in any way.There are three toilets in a small room off the common area; the toilets are set side by side against a wall with no dividing partitions.There is a pay phone and a water fountain in the common room.The dormitories were clean on the day Human Rights Watch visited the facility, and none of the children interviewed indicated that sanitary conditions were a problem.Other problems were identified with the physical environment.TD,41 age fifteen, said that she was told when to go to the bathroom and that when she asked permission to go to the bathroom, her request was only granted "sometimes".The children are issued jeans, t-shirts, sweatshirts, underwear, socks, a pair of running shoes, rubber boots and a rain jacket.The jeans have 'LTI' printed down one leg. Children are not allowed to wear their own clothing.Children who earn privileges at Monroe-LTI are able to wear some of their own clothing which suggests that there isno security reason for denying this right.Children may wear their own shoes if the medical staff certifies that it is necessary for health reasons.Bridge City-Louisiana Training InstituteThe Bridge City-LTI is located five minutes out of a residential district in Bridge City, which is located a half hour drive from New Orleans.The facility has a court-approved capacity of 150 children.On the first day that Human Rights Watch visited in March 1995,144 children were on campus.The facility houses only boys.The facility has large outdoor spaces, a playing field and trees; flowers are planted each spring by children on a work detail at the facility.The buildings are for the most part brick; much of the facility was originally part of a religious girls school.The dormitories house forty children per sleeping room.There are two sleeping rooms in each of the buildings that house children.The children sleep on metal double-bunk beds that are arranged along each of the long walls with two foot lockers underneath each bed.There are windows along the same wall.The children are provided with blankets and pillows and fresh linen weekly, more often if necessary. The bathroom off of the sleeping room has three showers, one toilet and one urinal. There are no dividing or privacy partitions in the bathroom area.There is a water fountain against the wall.In the recreation room there is a water fountain and a bank of phones against the wall and an adjoining bathroom with one toilet and one urinal.The children are issued jeans, t-shirts, sweatshirts, running shoes, socks, underwear and jackets, and for Sundays they are issued khaki pants and shirts and black dress shoes.Their hair is shaved to a short stubble.They are neither able to wear their own clothing, nor wear longer hair.None of the other facilities require the children to shave their hair.It is a practise that enhances the harsh atmosphere, contrary to international standards which specify rehabilitation and treatment, not punishment.Monroe-Louisiana Training InstituteThe Monroe-LTI is located in a residential area of the city of Monroe, next to a hospital.Monroe is in the north of Lousiana, approximatelythree and a half hours from Baton Rouge by car.It has a court-approved capacity of 356.On the day that Human Rights Watch visited in May 1995,it was below capacity but waiting for the arrival of children being sent from other facilities for disciplinary purposes.The facility houses only boys.When the campus was first built it was simply integrated into the surrounding neighborhood without fences.As a result the campus has createda normal environment with named city streets running through it,large open green spaces, a playing field, trees, flowers and even sidewalks.The buildings are almost all red or yellow brick of varying sizes.In the early 1980s the closed campus was created.Monroe-LTI is composed of an open and a closed campus, although both campuses are secure. The closed campus is separated from the open campus by an extra fence.All entrances to the closed campus from the open campus are secured by correctional officers.Children from all of the LTI's and TCCY who are judged by the facilities to be incorrigible are sent to the Monroe-LTI closed campus.The closed campus has four dormitories and also maintains twenty-four isolation cells in another dormitory.Confinement to the closed campus is administered in stages as part of a three-level behavior program, beginning with a child's assignment to an isolation cell and graduating to the dormitories as his behavior is judged to be modified appropriately.The chain-link fence around the whole facilitywas erected in 1984, and in 1993 all of the fences were topped with large size coiled razor wire at the direction of the then new Governor Edwin Edwards's correctional administration.The dormitories are spread throughout the campus and house between thirty-four and forty-four children each.The buildings vary between single-story, two-story and three-story buildings.The three-story dormitory has one floor of administrative offices.The children sleep in metal double- bunk beds arranged around the perimeter of the room.There is one toilet and one urinal in the sleeping room itself.The adjoining bathroom has no partitions between the showers, toilets and urinals.The numbers of each vary with the size of the dormitory.In one dormitory housing thirty-four children there were five showers, two urinals and three toilets.The children are issued sweatshirts, t-shirts, jeans and running shoes, as at the other LTI's.At Monroe-LTI, however, there is also a point system that rewards good behavior under which a child may be entitled to get some of his own clothes sent to him for use at the facility.Monroe-LTI is the only facility that operates such an incentive system.Tallulah Correctional Center for YouthTallulah Correctional Center for Youth is located in the town of Tallulah in the north of Louisiana, about a half hour drive from Monroe and three and a half hours from Baton Rouge.The facility has a court-approved capacity of396.On the day that Human Rights Watch visited in May 1995,there were 395 children on the campus. There are plans to expand the facility by 350 beds, 240 of which will be single cellisolation and administrative segregation cells.Although the ground has been broken for the new building, progress has been held up due to the state of emergency declared by the federal court, described earlier.All the buildings look alike, with gray siding and concrete floors; they are placed close together.The buildings are connected by concrete walkways, and the dormitories are enclosed by high chain-link fences.There is no grass on the property and no playing field.The gymnasium consists of a concrete floor and a roof held up by posts.This is also the visiting area.The whole facility appears to be cramped, institutional and drab, particularly in comparison to the open green spaces of the state-runfacilities.All the dormitories are identical: one-room buildings with concrete floors.Forty children live in each dormitory.Twenty double-bunk beds are arranged in two rows along one wall in each.Underneath each bed are two unlocked foot lockers.Each dormitory has three long grey tables with long benches on either side and a television in the corner nearest the tables.There is a water fountain and four pay phones.Four toilets are separated from the showers by a partition and there is a low partition between the toilets.There are two urinals and six showers.The children wear unmarked t-shirts, sweatshirts, jeans and sneakers.On the day that Human Rights Watch visited the facility, it was raining heavily.The children were not wearing rain jackets.Some of the children interviewed told Human Rights Watch that a confrontation early in the winter was sparked partly by the fact that the children were not issued coats for the colder weather.The children are not allowed to wear their own clothing.When TCCY first opened, on November 16, 1994, there were significant problems in the operation of the facility.The staff hired by TransAmerican Develpment Associates, Inc. were unable to keep control of the children.Some children told HRW that they were moved to the facility without being told where they were going and once at the facility were given conflicting information about the length of time they would spend at TCCY and the nature of their program.Two children who had been confined at the facility since the opening described being awoken at 3:00 A.M.. at EBR-LTI and being told to take off all their clothes and to put on the new ones issued from TCCY.They were then bused up to TCCY in the middle of the night without being told where they were being taken.The DPSC assumed operational authority of the facility on December 29, 1994, pursuant to a Federal court-declared state of emergency at TCCY, on December 22,after an accumulation of disturbances made it clear to the court that order could not be maintained under the administration of the private management services corporation.42 Until the court declared a state of emergency authorizing the DPSC to assume operational control, there had been no indication that the DPSC would involve itself in a resolution of the problems.Human Rights Watch was told by Superintendent Goodwin at TCCY that the security system has been brought under control and that the administration of the facility is now operatedmore effectively.There was, however, a confrontation between the staff and the children in a dormitory on April 19, 1995, which suggests that the security system is still not as effective as it should be and that the children do not have sufficient respect for the security system.Although the reasons for the disturbance are not clear, the children in one dormitory were reported to be "loud, unruly and causing chaos" all evening.43The situation escalated when the children began throwing shoes and deodorant at the correctional officers.The correctional officers set off "Clear Out," a chemical agent, and left the dormitory.The children began "destroying" the dormitory, "knocking the T.V. down, pulling the water fountain off the wall, pulling sinks and urinals off the wall [and] overturning bunks."More Clear Out was set off and several of the children put towels, sheets and pillowcases around their faces.The situation was brought under control, and the children were removed and restrained within one hour.The forty-one children in the dormitory were dispersed to be housed as follows:"Nineteen were placed in segregation (the total count of this unit is twenty), fourteen were placed in the ward in the infirmary (this ward normally holds up to six offenders), eight were placed in the intake room in the segregation unit, and three were placed in the isolation rooms in the infirmary."There were no significant injuries to staff or children.HRW does not have sufficient information to determine whether the response to the riot was appropriate.GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PHYSICAL CONDITIONSThe facilities described above fail to comply with international standards in many respects. Although contrary to both international law standards and ACA standards,the state facilites in Louisiana use large dormitories exclusively.All of the standards recommend the use of single cells or at minimum small dormitories.44The large dormitories and the open bathrooms afford the children absolutely no privacy at any time in their daily lives.Large dormitories have also been found to be directly and positively linked to child-on-child injury and the increased use of isolation to control juvenile behavior.45Many children told HRW about getting into fights in their dormitories, or being picked on by other children in their dormitories.During the period from July 1994 to July 1995, there were 614 incidents of child-on-child assaults at Monroe-LTI, 545 incidents at EBR-LTI and eighty-three at Bridge City-LTI.46Frequently physical abuse by the correctional officers (which will be described later in the report) occurs in the process of breaking up a fight between children in a dormitory.The physical environment of all the facilities, but EBR-LTI and TCCY in particular, is punitive.The size of the facilities precludes individualized treatment to a large extent.Staff and children at the facilities told Human Rights Watch that isolation cells are often used to control the behavior of a child.The isolation cells are small and bare except for a bed, a toilet and a sink.There are generally no windows; where there are windows, they are so small that no significant natural light is let in, and they are covered by wire mesh.The doors have small windows for observation and slots through which food is passed at mealtimes.At Bridge City-LTI the isolation cells are painted a dark color on the walls, floors and ceilings.Placement in a dark cell andclosed or solitary confinement is absolutely prohibited by Rule 67 of theU.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty.TheU.N. Rules also encourage contact between confined children and their families and communities.Rules 59-61 require regular visits, preferably once a week but at minimum once a month, and a right to twice weekly telephone calls and letter writing. All of the facilities have visiting day only once a month.They are contact visits which usually occur in a large open room or space at the facility, generally the gymnasium or a similar location.Parents are not permitted to bring food for their children on visiting day.Because of the size of the facilities there is no attempt to locate facilities in the communities from which the children come.A substantial percentage of the children come from the urban areas, in particular Orleans Parish.Yet Bridge City-LTI, the closest facility to the parish, is the smallest and least secure facility.Because of the travel distances to the facilities, many of the children never receive visitors, and most do not have visitors every month.Telephone calls are generally permitted every night from the pay phones in the common rooms in the dormitories.Many children told HRW that their parents cannot afford to pay the collect phone charges, so they do not speak with their parents on a regular basis.At Monroe-LTI the counsellors are required to make a phone call to the parents of each child in their care once a month at the facility's expense.47This system ensures that the children speak with their parents at least once a month.The children said they are unable to call their lawyers because the lawyers will not accept the collect charges.There is also no privacy when making the phone calls, as the phones are located on a wall in the common room.Some children told us that they were denied the opportunity to make phone calls by other children in their dormitory. Others said that the length of time they were given to use the phone was restricted by the staff to between three and eight minutes.When the children are placed in disciplinary segregation, there does not appear to be any opportunity to use the telephone, as the children are not permitted to leave the isolation cell except once a day to take a shower.Human Rights Watch, however, was not told of any specific rule that prevented the children from using the telephone while segregated from the rest of the population.Writing paper and stamped envelopes are not uniformly or regularly supplied to the children.Many of the children said that they get writing paper, pencils and stampsfrom their parents.It is an article commonly included in the packages sent to the facilities by parents.There does not appear to be any institutional encouragement to write letters.The location of the institutions, the overall environment of monthly visits, shortened telephone calls, if any are made at all, and irregular letter writing do not foster contacts between the children and their families.Children at all the facilities told Human Rights Watch that they rarely saw their counsellors, whose role it is to provide guidance, counselling and individual attention to the children.Strengthening contacts with family and other persons in their home community and individual attention from a counsellor are considered by international standards to be an integral part of creating a treatment environment.48DISCIPLINEChildren are subject to different disciplinary standards than those that apply to adults, because under international standards the purpose of a child's confinement is not punishment but rehabilitation and treatment.49U.S. Constitutional law protects children from conditions that amount to punishment.50Rule 67 of theU.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty prohibits cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.It specifically prohibits corporal punishment and the use of solitary confinement under any circumstances.Rule 68 of the U.N. Rules requires that clear rules set out the conduct that constitutes a disciplinary offense and the sanction that will be imposed.Rule 24 of theU.N. Rules requires that upon admission to a facility, all children be given a copy of the governing rules of the institution.U.S. Constitutional law cases have found that children may not be placed in isolation for purely disciplinary purposes; rather they "may only be placed in isolation whenthey pose immediate threats to themselves or other people."51Moreover, isolation should be for as short a period of time as is necessary to enable a child's violent mood to subside.Giving a child books and writing materials in isolation reinforces its non-punitive nature.When children are placed in isolation in LTI's52 they are not able to participate in any of the programming at the facilities.They are let out only to have a shower each day. They are not provided with anything to do, no books, no paper and pencil, no television.They are simply given nothing to occupy their time.According to the ACA standards, disciplinary isolation may last a maximum of five days.This is the standard purportedly followed by the LTI's.This does not comply with the international standards set out above, nor does it appear to comply with the U.S. constitutional law decisions which restrict the use of isolation to instances where children pose an immediate threat to themselves or others, referred to above.Most children interviewed at all the institutions, except Bridge City-LTI, confirmed that disciplinary isolation generally lasted a maximum of five days.There were exceptions, however:TA at EBR-LTI told us that she had spent nine consecutive days in disciplinary lockdown.She also said that the guards sometimes refuse to let children out of the cells during the isolation period.None of the children interviewed at Bridge City-LTI had been in lockdown, nor had they ever heard of anyone placed in lockdown.The lockdown log book at Bridge City-LTI confirmed that no child had been in the cells since November 1994.Human Rights Watch was told by Superintendent Harris that when isolation is used it is only for one hour at a time to bring a child's behavior under control.Children are, however, placed in what the institutions call "protective custody", or administrative segregation, for longer periods of time than five days at all the facilitiesexcept Bridge City-LTI.53The administrative segregation cells are identical to the isolation cells and frequently located in the same building.The use of administrative segregation gives the institutional administration a power which is open to abuse and arbitrary use.There is no clear monitoring system or system of review at the correctional facilities to ensure that this power is not abused or over-used.Institutions use administrative segregation excessively.At TCCY, 240 of the 350 new beds being built will be single cells for use as administrative segregation cells and isolation cells.54At EBR-LTI, the staff uses what is called "pre-disciplinary detention" in the isolation cells.A child can spend up to three days in an isolation cell, prior to a determination that disciplinary isolation is required.Children reported that isolation is used frequently.UB, at EBR-LTI, said that on the day before she talked with us, she had been placed in isolation for seven hours simply for dancing.OK, age eighteen,at EBR-LTI, said that he was put in isolation for a "couple of hours" just for talking in the dining hall.At Monroe-LTI, one child alleged there was corruption in the isolation practices:C KJ, age eighteen, said:"Some of the guards are crooked, they ask for your money or else it's lockdown. [It's] cold [and] they take everything away from you and [you have] just your pj's."Several children reported that isolation cells were cold.At TCCY children in isolation prior to disciplinary hearings are provided with a mattress at all times, however, once a child is found "guilty" of a violation, the mattress is taken away between the hours of 6:00 A.M.. and 9:00 P.M. during his time in isolation.Human Rights Watch was not told about the use of this practice at any of the other facilities.Human Rights Watch was told by each of the superintendents of the facilities that the use of restraints was confined to circumstances where children needed to be brought under control or where they were being transported.None of the children interviewed said that they had either experienced or witnessed the application of handcuffs orshackles as punishment.However, a number of children told Human Rights Watch that they had either experienced or witnessed correctional officers placing handcuffs on a child to restrain him and then proceeding to beat him while he was restrained. In other instances where the use of restraints was described, it was unclear whether the restraints were a necessary security measure or an abuse of the power to restrain the children.DM, age nineteen, who had escaped from Monroe-LTI in 1993, told us that he is forced to wear shackles at all times, except when he is confined to his room.He was wearing shackles when HRW spoke with him.This unnecessary and cruel use of shackles is contrary to the international standards cited above.The international standards require that on admission children be given a copy of the rules and that the information contained in the rules be conveyed to them in a "manner enabling full comprehension."55Many of the children told us that they had not received a rule book upon arrival at the facility in which they were incarcerated. Being given a copy of the rules does not in itself guarantee that the rules will be applied fairly as written.Both children who had received a copy of the rules, and those who had not, told us that the "real" rules were created and applied at the discretion of the staff on duty.UB, at EBR-LTI, said that she got a copy of the rules, "but I didn't read them, because they don't run the institutes by the rules book."KM, age twenty, at EBR-LTI, said, "rules change every day."Human Rights Watch has reviewed the book of rules.It is drafted in complex language that is difficult to understand.It is unlikely that a reading of the rule book would provide adequate notice to the children of their rights and obligations, given the language in which it is written.56Secretary Richard Stalder of the DPSC told us that he wanted to change the language of the rules to make them more accessible to both staff and children.57PHYSICAL ABUSEInternational law is clear and consistent in its prohibition of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.The prohibition is contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child at article 37(a).58TheU.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice prohibit corporal punishment in Article 17.3, and Rules 63 and 64 of theU.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty prohibit the use of restraints or force in any case unless all other control methods have been exhausted and failed.59A violation of any of these provisions is physical abuse.In accordance with the ACA standards, the DPSC has adopted a standard operating procedure that specifically restricts the use of physical force to instances of justifiable self-defense, protection of others, protection of property, and prevention of escapes, and then only as a last resort. Under the DPSC procedure, physical force is never justifiable as punishment.60HRW received complaints of physical abuse at all of the facilities we examined.The frequency of abuse varied between the facilities.At the Bridge City-LTI only one child complained to us of abuse by a guard.61The problem of physical abuse by security staff at the facilities is more serious at Monroe-LTI and TCCY; at EBR-LTI physical abuse is pervasive.Children told us that they had been beaten for just "looking at someone wrong."A former staff person of the DPSC told Human Rights Watch that correctional officers have told him that the abuse problem is worsening,but that they will not report the problem because they are afraid of losing their jobs and of the repercussions in their relations with other correctional officers.Allegations of abuse varied widely from institution to institution.Secretary Stalder of the DPSC told Human Rights Watch that there is no systematic record of the number of allegations of abuseof children by staff.62East Baton Rouge-Louisiana Training InstituteChildren interviewed about the conditions atEBR-LTI said the following things about the physical abuse problem:C EC, age seventeen, said :"[The] night shift don't like me ... one of my friends was beaten up.They are beating people like us because we look at them, a lot of people are fighting ... I got hit in the head with handcuffs three weeks ago ... [the guard] hit me with a basketball.I asked him why and he pressed against me and I stepped back because I thought that he was going to swing and the other guard held me down and hit me with handcuffs and kicked me."63C BA, age sixteen, said:"[I have] been beaten up once by the guards, [he] used [his] fists.I was sitting on a bench and [he] said I was talking and hit me and gave me a [disciplinary] ticket and two days later I went to the [disciplinary] committee and they gave me work detail."C DR, age fifteen, said:"I got in trouble with one of the guards, I was talking and watching TV [around] bedtime and said I hope that they send me to Tallulah or Bridge City so I can go home.A guard came from behind and jumped on my back and started kicking and punching me with his hands.I went to court the next day.I told mama and the judge called here and told them to put me in C wing [protective custody].My eye was swollen and my lip busted, so mama knew.I couldn't fight back.It happened so quick.I didn't know what hit me."C BN, age sixteen, said:"The guards round here beat you up.They use handcuffs and whatever they get their hands on ... Counsellors will let the guards beat you up."C OK, age sixteen, said:"[Two weeks ago]my friend got hit with handcuffs over not moving a picnic table.He had a cut up by his eye, it was bleeding and left a scar, but he didn't have to get stitches ... We get mace thrown in our eyes when they try to break up fights."C EJ, age seventeen, said:"They hit you for any reason, with handcuffs, with hands.I've been hit with hands twice because I messed up the count by accident.He pulled me to the side and smacked my head two times.I've lots of times seen people hit.[In] April [I saw] two guards sure beating [another boy].One was holding him and one was beating him ... they bust his nose all up, there was a lot of blood, they sent him to Delta lockdown."C UD, age seventeen, said:"In area one the guards beat you up with their hands...they beat CS up bad. They beat him up ... Sergeant G is the one who really beats you up.He beats you up for calling him Sergeant. [Sergeant G] slapped [CS] and cursed him.He asked to go to the infirmary and he said no ... [Sometimes] we be up in the dorm in the back; if you miss the count or talk in the dormitory they beat you up for that and if you get up to get water. [Sergeant G] is just doing it for the fun of it...One time the dorm was sick, we had a virus, and he beat us up for coughing.My friend, they took his mattress and made him sleep in the shower because of his coughing ... They rush for you to eat your food.If you don't rush they take your fork away and throw it away.They beat you if you are too slow.You have about three minutes to eat."C ED, age sixteen, said:"I had a fight with a couple of them, they be hitting on you with handcuffs.I got hit in the head and had my teeth knocked out.It happened a lot."C BA, age sixteen, said:"A couple of nights ago I was talking and got slapped across the face for it ... for messing the count up they punched me in the side of the face ... Mr. K jumped on me, put some black cut-off gloves on and [was] beating on me ... they said if we find out, you rat, then we'll come back after you ... the next morning I peed blood because he kicked me in the wrong spot ... he took me in a little room to beat me, a room on the side ofthe dormitory. [He said] "you seem to have a little problem" and then they just beat on you ... the guards break you up, and they beat you to break it up, sometimes they hit you with the handcuffs or the shackles and then put them on you and take you to infirmary."C TM, age seventeen, described an incident in which he was not familiar with the shower rules and neglected to stand naked against the wall waiting for everyone to finish their showers.When he went to get his clothes, he said the guard,"hit me in the head, I fell down and he kicked me a couple times and then when I got up he hit me again."On another occasion TM said he witnessed two guards taking turns beating up two boys who had been fighting.He said, "they wrote a report saying that his black eye was caused by the other boy...[the guards] hit the fat boy in the head and stomach and stomped on him ... they did this right in front of everybody, then made us all go to bed early."C TS, age nineteen, said:"One time he tried to get another guard to help beat me up ... in the dining hall, but not in front of everyone, in the little entrance way.First he put cuffs on, then started hitting me in the face and kicking me."C KJ, age eighteen, said:"My first day there they had some suicide precaution, so I tried to say I was suicidal, so a guard asked me if I wanted to kill myself, so I said yeah so I could leave, but he just kicked me and hit me full in the side of the face.I was in full shackles and fell down and he kicked me out and so I shut up after that."C UD said:"That's how come I came up here from EBR because a guard beat me and another guy up with a broom.It's going to court, but they say I was in a fight and he beat us up with a broom and got a few minor bruises."C ED said:"I got hit one time by a sergeant with a book cause we weren't supposed to talk and I giggled and he made me get on my knees and he hit me on my head and my face."C EM, age fifteen, said:"EBR, that's a messed up place.The guards will beat you.One of them named Mr.O, he has a thing called a 'house party', if you work on weekends, he wake you up at 5 A.M. .He calls you in the back where we take showers and beats you for a whole hour. When we go to mess hall to eat we have to count, and he tells you to come see, then he calls youinto the washroom and beats you up and another sergeant comes to beat you. It has only happened two times to me ... I would change EBR. [I would] fire all the workers cause they are just dirty."New jacks" come in talking, and they beat them up for nothing.This boy at EBR with me, a guard broke his arm with a broom ... [there were] boys lying on the floor and the sarge picked up his chair and threw it at him and hit him.If you tell a counselor, all it's going to do is make it worse."C KN, age fourteen, said:"That place [EBR] was the worst place ever.I wasn't used to it.They slapped me cause I shared food and a guard walked up and came up and slapped me in the face and then took me into the laundry room and hit me again.Guards call us rats and stuff and people are stupid. Even if they don't talk they get hit."C BG, age eighteen, said:"All my ribs were purple at EBR.A new boy came in and I tried to help him so he wouldn't get beaten up, and then a guard pulled us both up and he slapped both of us and then he told me to raise my arms and he beat my ribs until they were purple and blue and I didn't tell my mom cause I knew she would start something."C UB said:"Every day ... they be hitting on pregnant girls. [On Sunday] the pregnant girls didn't want to go in for bed rest, they were pushing and shoving them, [the guards] carry them, just holding them by their arms and legs, and [they] picked one of them up over their shoulders, [there were] probably five guards, one man dropped a girl on her back."Ms. Gagneaux, the head nurse on staff at EBR-LTI,64 told Human Rights Watch that the most common illnesses for which children came to the infirmary were orthopedic injuries such as broken jaws, broken hands and broken noses.She said that there were a lot allegations of abuse made, and sometimes they were followed up, and that there were cases where children did not report the source of their injury to the nurse on duty. She also said that many of the allegations are found by staff to be unfounded.Human Rights Watch was not told of any systematic reporting of suspected cases of abuse by the medical staff.Monroe-Louisiana Training InstituteChildren interviewed about conditions at Monroe-LTI had the following things to say about physical abuse:C ED, age sixteen, said:"They don't hit on you with handcuffs, but they hit you with their hands and they kick you with their boots.I haven't been hit here yet, not yet.I saw a guard punch a guy with his fist last Saturday.He went to the infirmary, his eye was swole."C GD, age seventeen, said:"Stay your distance [from the guards].People get hit every day, all the time.They use their hands and handcuffs."C KJ, age eighteen, said:"In the past they were hitting.I've had my share of bruises and footprints on my face, but they are better."C UD said:"Mr. X hit him in the face with a radio, and he hit CA with his fist and broke his nose.They be slapping you every now and then.Mr. Y, he hits people while they are asleep; somebody might talk, and he hits them."C LJ, age sixteen, said:"I've been beat up a lot of times.I can't count, it be so many.They get some handcuffs and hit you up the side of the head and cut your head.They stomp on you when you fall down.A couple of days ago Mr. X hit a guy in the face with a radio ... they beat you up, they call you out where other offenders can't see you, in some room somewhere."C RR, age seventeen, said:"When you fight, they bust you in the head with [handcuffs].I've seen that about, I believe it was Friday, two dudes fighting, [the guard] put handcuffs over his fingers and put the key in to make a fist, then he hit them over the head; they complained, and they got their lawyers." Several other children told us about the same incident.Human Rights Watch was told by the children that the incident was under investigation.We were told by Superintendent Robert Dunavant that a recent abuse incident was under investigation, but we have heard nothing further on the matter.A few of the children told Human Rights Watch that the guards at Monroe-LTI sold contraband to some of the other children.They said that nobody talked about it, and the children were not prepared to give the names of the guards involved.The court expert appointed by Judge Polozola confirmed that she had received similar complaints but that there was never enough evidence to pursue the complaints.Tallulah Correctional Center for YouthThe children confined at TCCY made fewer complaints about physical abuse.Where abuse was reported, it was attributed to the DPSC security staff.The children interviewed about conditions at TCCY said the following about physical abuse:C BG, age eighteen, said:"It used to be alright but the DPSC came in and has to do their own thing.They beat you up and stuff ... they got a pack, three of them, and they run around and beat people up.Mymama wants to check. [One time when there were] no white people in the cafeteria, so [the man serving the food] skipped me three times and then started punching me and others joined and said this be for 300 years ago what you did to my people."C SC said:"I had my eardrum bust, March 22nd, the dormitory they stuck me out because I was the only one from Baton Rouge, the rest are from New Orleans, and the lieutenant punched me in the ear and busted my eardrum. I went to Conway hospital in Monroe ... I reported the ear drum.The nurse said she wrote it up, but you can't always listen to them and nothing happened."A few children who had been at both TCCY and EBR-LTI commented that the security staff at TCCY were more understanding and more willing to talk rather than hit as compared to EBR-LTI.Bridge City-Louisiana Training InstituteOf the children interviewed at Bridge City-LTI, only one mentioned physical abuse. The rest of the children interviewed said that they had never experienced physical abuse, nor had they witnessed it, at that facility.CM, age thirteen,said, "the guards here are better.They take their time with you, explain things."This sentiment was expressed by several children who told us that they liked the fact that the guards talked to them.However, the abuse described by the one child at Bridge City-LTI was very serious:C KG, age fourteen, said,"What had happened is this guard was walking around with a broomstick and he made a line of people and he hit guys ontop of the head and they fell down.The other day they were punishing us by making us hold our hands out for thirty minutes and one guy dropped his fingers and they came over and beat him up and threw a chair at him. Another punishment is thinking position.They make you hold up your weight on your elbows for ten minutes even if its only one guy who messed up; the skin rips off your arms and elbows ... one guard, he hits you with a cable wire, he wets your hand and arm and whips you."COMPLAINT PROCESSU.N. Rules 75 and 76 provide that children should have the opportunity to make complaints and to be informed of the response without delay.The Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP) under which children in the Louisiana correctional facilities are entitled to complain to the superintendent about physical abuse is virtually never used.During the period from July 1994 to March 1995, the summary of ARPS65 prepared by each institution showed that there were no complaints of abuse at Bridge City-LTI and only one complaint of abuse at EBR-LTI. At Monroe-LTI, where, according to Superintendent Dunavant,the ARP system is functioning much more effectively, there were seventy-seven complaints of abuse during the same period of time.The number of complaints per month dropped dramatically after the first three months of the period reported.There is no reporting by TCCY.The children we spoke to universally had no confidence in the system.Complaints are rarely made as a result of this lack of confidence, and when they are made there is frequently no response at all.Many of the children told us that when they wrote complaints they were ripped up by the guards when they gave the paper to them, or that the complaints were never passed on to the captain in charge.There is a strong fear of reprisal among the children.C LJ, age sixteen, said:"If you write them up and they find out, they are away for a couple of days, and then they try to hit you up for anything you do."Despite the existence of the ARP, Superintendent Elijah Lewis at EBR-LTI told us that he had no way of knowing how many children in total complained of abuse66 and how many staff members had been disciplined for abusing children.However, after our visit, he reported to Secretary Stalder that there had been ninety-two reported cases of alleged abuse; six of the cases had been confirmed and disciplinary action had been taken.There was no indication what the disciplinary action was.67Three days after Human Rights Watch's second visit to EBR-LTI, a child complained that he had received lacerations to the head area and the correctional officer named was placed on forced leave.An investigation was conducted, and the complaint was substantiated. The correctional officer received an emergency verbal suspension.68The children we talked to had the following to say about the ARP:C EC, age seventeen, said:"I wrote a complaint and told the truth and the officer came and got me and we started fisting.Sometimes they tear them up...every time someone in the dormitory files a complaint, nothing has ever happened."C DM, age nineteen, said:"They use physical force but when it goes down everything comes up clean, like nothing happens."C BC, age twenty, said:"The guards write reports and say that the offenders hit first, that's why nobody did nothing about it."C EK, age eighteen, said:"You can't beat their words.I wrote them up a couple times and I never got no response."FOODRule 37 of theU.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty provides that children must receive food of a quality and quantity to satisfy the standards of health and hygiene.Virtually every child interviewed at all the facilities, except Bridge City-LTI, told Human Rights Watch that he was hungry.At Bridge City-LTI the children said that they received better quality food than at the other facilities and a sufficient quantity of food.At the other facilities the portions of food served are inadequate according to the children.The children consistently made the following kinds of statements about the quantity of the food served:C UB told Human Rights Watch that she had lost 31 lbs. since her arrival at the LTI.C EC, age seventeen, said:"They don't feed us enough."C BA, age sixteen, said:"The food tastes like soap."C BN, age sixteen, said:"No taste to it.Don't get enough. Can't get full."C OK, age sixteen, said:"Don't be enough."The breakfasts and lunches served at the LTI's are funded by the federal government's school lunch program.In a meeting with the secretary of the DPSC, Human Rights Watch raised the issue of inadequate portions of food.The secretary agreed that there was a possibility that the portion sizes specified for the school lunch program might not be fixed with a view to the appetites of sixteen and seventeen-year-old boys. However, the secretary was of the opinion that all health and nutritional standards were met by the meals served at the LTI's.69In response to Human Rights Watch's expressed concern, Superintendent Dunavant of Monroe-LTI offered to look into the possibility of increasing the portion sizes, noting that the portion specifications were a minimum requirement, not a maximum requirement.Human Rights Watch was not told whether the DPSC authorized any increase in portion size.Although the quantities were said to be insufficient, there were fewer complaints about the quality of the food.Human Rights Watch was told by children who had been in several facilities that the quality of the food at EBR-LTI and JRDC was significantly worse than at the other two state-run facilities.There were complaints of meat and chicken being rare or raw in the middle.Some of the children complained about the sanitary conditions in the kitchens.KJ, age eighteen, who works in the dining hall at Monroe-LTI, said, "the cooks up here are dirty.They drop food on the floor and pick it up and serve it up."UM, age fourteen, said, "one day they dropped food on the floor and then picked it back up and gave it to us."We had meals at both EBR-LTI and Monroe-LTI.We found the food to be adequate, though it lacked seasoning, particularly, we were told, to the Louisiana palate which is accustomed to salt.Human Rights Watch was also told by some children that the food on days that visitors came was invariably much better quality than on other days.EDUCATION AND PROGRAMMINGArticle 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children have a right to education and that primary education must be compulsory and free.The right to education is reiterated in U.N. Rule 38.U.N. Rules 39 through 46 detail the parameters of the right to education, vocational training and work.The right includes education for children of compulsory school age and access to further education for children above compulsory school age.Article 26.6 of the Beijing Rules provides that children should not leave the institution at an educational disadvantage.U.N. Rule 47 sets out the children's right to a daily period of recreation, outdoors if possible, and additional daily time for leisure activities , like arts and crafts.All of the facilities, except the JRDC section at EBR-LTI,have a school program and some time set aside each day, usually about one hour, for recreation.In general children attended school either in the morning or in the afternoon for three hours. There is no school for children housed at the JRDC.Since many of the children are found to be at a grade level below the one corresponding to their age, most of the schooling programs are alternative education programs.Many of the children interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they had not been in school right before they were admitted to the institutions.The school provides basic education in math and literacy and builds on the child's education as he or she progresses.The teachers are, for the most part, drawn from the school system in the area in which the institution is located.There is provision for special education at all the facilities, to some extent.Monroe-LTI appears to have the most highly developed staff ofteachers in the area of special education.Most of the children commented relatively favorably on school, saying that it was an acceptable way to pass time and was sometimes interesting.All of the facilities provide classes to prepare children for their Graduate Equivalency Degree (GED).However, once a child achieves a GED there are no further educational opportunities.At Monroe-LTI, KJ, age eighteen, who wanted to take college courses, said, "If you are smarter, you don't get good education.It pays to be stupid, you get rewarded."Superintendent Dunavant told HRW that one child at Monroe-LTI did a teleconference course from Northeast University in Louisiana in 1994, but that college courses were not generally available.He also told us that when a child wants to go to college his approach is to try to convince a court to let the child out to attend college.Secretary Stalder of the DPSC told HRW that college courses were not possible because of lack of funds.The institutions have no policy of facilitating the pursuit of higher education .Human Rights Watch visited each of the facilities on a weekday, at an hour during which the children, or at least some of them, would normally be in school.At every facility there were empty classrooms at the time the visit occurred and a substantial proportion of the children were not in school.At Bridge City-LTI most of the teachers were gone on the first day Human Rights Watch visited, apparently on training programs, but no one that Human Rights Watch spoke to was quite sure of where the teachers were.EBR-LTI, but not JRDC, is fortunate enough to have the Model Continuum of Rehabilitative Care (MCRC)program, which is funded by a grant from the federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT).The program includes interaction with the parents, substance abuse treatment, aftercare, job placement and a large educational component.Children learn on computers, using a specially designed computer program which includes the Job Skills Education Program (JSEP).That program gives children the foundation for at least 350 different job prescriptions.The children who were participating in this program expressed satisfaction with the program, particularly the sense that the interactive computer program was like having their own personal tutor.Bridge City-LTI and Monroe-LTI recently received funding from the DPSC to set up the computer job training portion of the MCRC program.Recreation at the facilities is inconsistently provided from facility to facility.Some of the children told HRW that during the recreational period at EBR-LTI they are often made to sit on the floor in the gym and do nothing for the entire hour; for outside recreation time the childrensaid that they are often made to sit on the sidewalk.OK,age eighteen, said, "yesterday, I'm a dormitory rep, I go to a meeting and tell them the dormitory needs some outside rec, the man ain't letting us out, he come ready to hit because I told he didn't give us outside rec."Many of the children at TCCY said that there was not enough to do at the facility and that there was more to do at EBR-LTI.The children at Monroe-LTI and Bridge City-LTI, except those in isolation, of course, generally said that they had lots of things to do and that the activities were interesting and, in some cases, enjoyable.At Monroe-LTI there is a "boys club" which operates a canteen and has various activities including pottery, pool and weights.The children interviewed at Monroe-LTI commented favorably on the club activities.The three LTI's all provide vocational training.Monroe-LTI has the most highly developed vocational training program.It includes working as apprentices to various trades.On the day that Human Rights Watch visited, two children were helping to set up an air conditioning system in the school.The regular vocational programs focus on small engine repair, upholstery and carpentry.There are also parenting skills programs, to differing degrees, at each of the LTI's.At Monroe-LTI the parenting program is operated on an annual grant of$25,000 from the state formula grant money distributed by the OJJDP and awarded through the State Advisory Group.The parenting program started out as a comprehensive program that included an overnight visit component.A small house was assigned for use by the program and set up to mimic a home.As part of the program the confined children's babies were able occasionally to spend an entire weekend in this monitored "home" situation with their parents.Human Rights Watch was told by an official who requested anonymity that although no problems ever occurred, the administration of Governor Edwards stopped the overnight visit component of the program, citing liability risks.Bridge City-LTI also has a parenting program, and EBR-LTI provides some parenting skills training to girls who are pregnant.When a girl has a child during her term at the LTI, the baby is taken from her immediately after delivery and placed in the care of a family member or put into foster care.At Bridge City-LTI there is a program called the Short Term Offender Program (STOP).STOP is for children, boys only, who are generally first time property offenders.The boys are required to serve only ninety days in the program, which includes components on substance abuse and victim impact awareness.TCCY ostensibly has a Louisiana Intensive Training and Education Program, the "LITE" program, which is for boys serving shorter sentences, and a regular LTI program.The "LITE" program is supposed to be a boot camp program.The children interviewedsaid that there did not seem to be any difference between the two programs, and many were given conflicting information on which program they were participating in. Human Rights Watch was unable to discern the difference between the programs, and none of the children interviewed said that they were participating in boot camp type activities beyond some drills.However, Bridge City- LTI, which does not purport to be a boot camp, has an atmosphere more akin to a boot camp.At Bridge City -LTI the children's heads are shaved close and they are required to do marching style drills for at least one hour every day, often more, and sometimes for as much as four hours on the weekend.THE PRINCIPLE OF NORMALIZATION AND TREATMENTInternational standards clearly enunciate the principle that children who are incarcerated are to be cared for and treated.The goal of the incarceration is to prepare children for their return to society.Incarceration is not for punishment, but rather for treatment.To that end the international standards develop the concept of "normalization.""Normalization" requires an institution to minimize the differences between life inside and life outside the institution.International standards encourage interaction between the children and their community, treatment with respect and dignity and the development of alternatives to incarceration.The physical surroundings of the four correctional facilities foster intimidation and punishment.The programming and counselling are inadequate to provide a full treatment program and on the days Human Rights Watch visited, there was little evidence that the children were being treated with respect and dignity at most times. The total lack of privacy magnifies the punishment atmosphere of the institutions.A judge in Orleans parish who did not want to be named said, "people may mouth treatment, but they don't mean it," and another judge in Jefferson parish told Human Rights Watch that the State was just "warehousing kids" in the LTI's and that he "did not have much confidence in the LTI's...I only send kids to LTI's as a last resort; you can't count on good, effective treatment." Even Superintendent Dunavant, of Monroe-LTI, told Human Rights Watch that keeping children in the LTI's until they are twenty-one years old means that when they are released, they cannot function as adults in society.70Some children in the institutions told us that they are not getting treatment or preparation for reintegration into society.JK, age eighteen, who had been at Monroe-LTI for three and a half years said, "I'm somewhat institutionalized.When they keep you a long time it just makes it worse.If they would have some type of rehab. courses, it would be better."EK, age nineteen, at Monroe-LTI, summed up the systemic and societal problems that are carried over to the LTI's, saying, "They just slap you up...I came from a family like that, that's all I had to go through all my life, being locked up ain't changing me...when they slap us up, it ain't doing nothing but pumping up anger in me...I mostly grew up in the system...since everyone telling me how it was, I knew I would be at LTI someday."This sentiment was echoed by Dr. Cecile Guin who has worked in the field of juvenile justice in Louisiana for eighteen years.She said, "No one cares enough to rock the boat so that the system can be changed ... Once the youth enters a juvenile institution, his or her chances of becoming a productive member of society are significantly decreased ... It is more likely that the youth has serious educational deficiencies that are not addressed during incarceration, is brutalized one way or another through the system and is released at a full term date with little or no preparation for reintegration into society ... Louisiana has never really implemented a comprehensive treatment program in the state."A particular issue that is symptomatic of the general treatment accorded to the children is that many are not even given the fundamental right to know when they are to be released from the facility, or they are given an adjudicated date of release by the court, but it is somehow modified or let to pass without formal extension of the date. According to the children we spoke with this is due to the fact that an aftercare plan has not yet been prepared for the child,71 or that there is no space yet in the alternative or aftercare program for which the child is slated, or that the child is simply not able to contact his or her lawyer before a court date so that he or she is then unable to make arrangements to attend court.The problem is particularly acute for the children from Orleans parish because of the large number of children from the parish who need an aftercare program and the lack of resources of the parish.KN, age fourteen, said, "I seen a lot of people here that are supposed to go home but they never leave, it worries me because they take so long."At TCCY, SC said his release date was supposed to be March 7 (he was interviewed on May 3) but that he had heard nothing about his release and he could not get in touch with anyone because all the phone calls are collect and the lawyers do not accept the calls.The overall atmosphere of the institutions, in particular EBR-LTI and TCCY, is one of hostility and anger.Very little appears to be done to assist children in their reintegration into society.Among the people Human Rights Watch spoke to in the institutions and outside of them, there seemed to be little hope that the children at the secure facilities would stay out of trouble once released.4RECOMMENDATIONSHuman Rights Watch offers the following recommendations regarding the human rights aspects of the confinement of children in Louisiana.To the state of Louisiana:C The Louisiana state government should develop mandatory standards that at minimum comply with international standards on the conditions of confinement for children and that are applicable to all public and private facilities.C Physical abuse by staff against children should be strictly prohibited.Staff found to have abused children should be appropriately disciplined, including dismissal.Where appropriate, criminal charges should be brought against the staff.Staff should be fully informed of the rules and consequences concerning physical abuse of children.C The Administrative Remedy Procedure should be made accessible and effective.The ARP should be written in clear language that can be easily understood and should be fully explained to children upon their arrival at an institution.Steps should be taken to ensure that the ARP is readily accessible, including the availability at all times of the proper forms on which to file a complaint.At each institution the ARP should be administered by a person independent of the institutional administration who can receive complaints without the involvement of security staff.Complaints should be responded to and thoroughly and promptly investigated.C Health care personnel should be employees of the Department of Health or other entity separate from the DPSC in order to have the independence required to report suspected abuse.C Isolation should never be used as a disciplinary measure.C Administrative segregation should be used only where absolutely necessary for the protection of a child.A decision to place a child in administrative segregation should be promptly and systematically reviewed.C Pre-disciplinary isolation should never be used, as it is punishment without benefit of due process.C Instruments of restraint like handcuffs or shackles should be used only where all other control methods have been exhausted and failed, and only where necessary to prevent the child from causing self-injury or injury to others.C Handcuffs and shackles should never be used as punishment.Handcuffs and shackles should not be used a means of preventing escape unless all other control methods have been exhausted and failed and where is no less intrusive method is available.C Denial of access to reading matter should never be used as a disciplinary measure.C Denial of outdoor time should never be used as a disciplinary measure. Children should be allowed at least one hour of daily outdoor exercise.C The use of large dormitories should be phased out.C The physical environment in which children are confined should be changed so as to afford children privacy while using the toilet facilities.Ideally each institution should contain single person rooms with toilet facilities contained within the room, as preferred by both international and national standards. As an interim measure, toilet facilities should be partitioned.C In any future construction of correctional facilities for children, the DPSC should build smaller facilities and should make every effort to confine children as close to their homes as possible to facilitate the maintenance of family bonds, important to the social development and reintegration of the child in society.C TCCY should be required to provide conditions which at minimum are consistent with the conditions at the state facilities.C Children should be released on the date specified by the court.Children should be told in advance of their release dates and should be given the opportunity to contact their lawyer at the expense of the facility in advance of the court date.C The institutions should develop a policy and practice of facilitating the pursuit of higher education by children who have completed their Graduate Equivalency Degrees.C Education should be provided to children at the JRDC.C The processing at JRDC should be completed within a reasonable time and, in any event, children should stay at JRDC for no longer than seven days.C The institutions should provide adequate programming and educational instruction to ensure that the children are not spending their time without any activity.The purpose of the programming and education is to prepare the child for a successful reintegration into society.C Children should be treated by staff with respect and dignity.To the Federal government:C The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention should, in accordance with the stated purposes of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, develop mandatory standards for the administration of juvenile justice.These standards should at minimum comply with international standards on the conditions of confinement for children and be applicable to all public and private facilities.C The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention should, in accordance with the stated purposes of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, assist state and local governments in improving the administration of justice.C The Office of Juvenile Justice and Deliquency Prevention should, in accordance with the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, monitor the states that participate in the formula grants program to ensure that status offenders are not held in secure confinement and that children are not held with adults.C Congress should pass legislation expanding the mandate of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to include a requirement to monitor the actual conditions of confinement for children in the justicesystem and states' compliance with U.S. constitutional law in the conditions of confinement for children.CThe Department of Justice, in accordance with the mandate of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, should regularly initiate investigations into the conditions in which children are confined to determine that they are in compliance with U.S. constitutional law.APPENDIX I: UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILDConvention on the Rights of the Child, G.A. res. 44/25, annex, 44 U.N.

The juvenile justice system should uphold the rights andsafety and promote the physical and mental well-being ofjuveniles. Imprisonment should be used as a last resort.2. Juveniles should only be deprived of their liberty inaccordance with the principles and procedures set forth in theseRules and in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for theAdministration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules).Deprivation of the liberty of a juvenile should be a dispositionof last resort and for the minimum necessary period and should belimited to exceptional cases. The length of the sanction shouldbe determined by the judicial authority, without precluding thepossibility of his or her early release.3. The Rules are intended to establish minimum standards acceptedby the United Nations for the protection of juveniles deprived oftheir liberty in all forms, consistent with human rights andfundamental freedoms, and with a view to counteracting thedetrimental effects of all types of detention and to fosteringintegration in society.4. The Rules should be applied impartially, withoutdiscrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, age,language, religion, nationality, political or other opinion,cultural beliefs or practices, property, birth or family status,ethnic or social origin, and disability. The religious andcultural beliefs, practices and moral concepts of the juvenileshould be respected.5. The Rules are designed to serve as convenient standards ofreference and to provide encouragement and guidance toprofessionals involved in the management of the juvenile justicesystem.6. The Rules should be made readily available to juvenile justicepersonnel in their national languages. Juveniles who are notfluent in the language spoken by the personnel of the detentionfacility should have the right to the services of an interpreter freeof charge whenever necessary, in particular during medicalexaminations anddisciplinary proceedings.7. Where appropriate, States should incorporate the Rules intotheir legislation or amend it accordingly and provide effectiveremedies for their breach, including compensation when injuriesare inflicted on juveniles. States should also monitor theapplication of the Rules.8. The competent authorities should constantly seek to increasethe awareness of the public that the care of detained juvenilesand preparation for their return to society is a social serviceof great importance, and to this end active steps should be takento foster open contacts between the juveniles and the localcommunity.9. Nothing in the Rules should be interpreted as precluding theapplication of the relevant United Nations and human rightsinstruments and standards, recognized by the internationalcommunity, that are more conducive to ensuring the rights, careand protection of juveniles, children and all young persons.10. In the event that the practical application of particularRules contained in sections II to V, inclusive, presents anyconflict with the Rules contained in the present section,compliance with the latter shall be regarded as the predominantrequirement.II.

As soon as possible after the moment of admission, eachjuvenile should be interviewed, and a psychological and socialreport identifying any factors relevant to the specific type andlevel of care and programme required by the juvenile should beprepared. This report, together with the report prepared by amedical officer who has examined the juvenile upon admission,should be forwarded to the director for purposes of determiningthe most appropriate placement for the juvenile within thefacility and the specific type and level of care and programmerequired and to be pursued. When special rehabilitative treatmentis required, and the length of stay in the facility permits,trained personnel of the facility should prepare a written,individualized treatment plan specifying treatment objectives andtime-frame and the means, stages and delays with which theobjectives should be approached.28. The detention of juveniles should only take place underconditions that take full account of their particular needs,status and special requirements according to their age,personality, sex and type of offence, as well as mental andphysical health, and which ensure their protection from harmfulinfluences and risk situations. The principal criterion for theseparation of different categories of juveniles deprived of theirliberty should be the provision of the type of care best suitedto the particular needs of the individuals concerned and theprotection of their physical, mental and moral integrity andwell-being.29. In all detention facilities juveniles should be separatedfrom adults, unless they are members of the same family. Undercontrolled conditions, juveniles may be brought together withcarefully selected adults as part of a special programme that hasbeen shown to be beneficial for the juveniles concerned.30.

Personal effects that thejuvenile does not choose to retain or that are confiscated shouldbe placed in safe custody. An inventory thereof should be signedby the juvenile. Steps should be taken to keep them in goodcondition. All such articles and money should be returned to thejuvenile on release, except in so far as he or she has beenauthorized to spend money or send such property out of thefacility. If a juvenile receives or is found in possession of anymedicine, the medical officer should decide what use should bemade of it.36.

These services shouldensure', to the extent possible, that the juvenile is providedwith suitable residence, employment, clothing, and sufficientmeans to maintain himself or herself upon release in order tofacilitate successful reintegration. The representatives ofagencies providing such services should be consulted and shouldhave access to juveniles while detained, with a view to assistingthem in their return to the community.V. PERSONNEL81. Personnel should be qualified and include a sufficient numberof specialists such as educators, vocational instructors,counsellors, social workers, psychiatrists and psychologists.These and other specialist staff should normally be employed on apermanent basis.

GAORSupp.(No. 53) at 207, U.N. Doc. A/40/53 (1985).PART ONEGENERAL PRINCIPLES1. Fundamental perspectives1.1 Member States shall seek, in conformity with their respectivegeneral interests, to further the well-being of the juvenile andher or his family.1.2 Member States shall endeavour to develop conditions that willensure for the juvenile a meaningful life in the community,which, during that period in life when she or he is mostsusceptible to deviant behaviour, will foster a process ofpersonal development and education that is as free from crime anddelinquency as possible.1.3 Sufficient attention shall be given to positive measures thatinvolve the full mobilization of all possible resources,including the family, volunteers and other community groups, aswell as schools and other community institutions, for the purposeof promoting the well-being of the juvenile, with a view toreducing the need for intervention under the law, and ofeffectively, fairly and humanely dealing with the juvenile inconflict with the law.1.4 Juvenile justice shall be conceived as an integral part ofthe national development process of each country, within acomprehensive framework of social justice for all juveniles,thus, at the same time, contributing to the protection of theyoung and the maintenance of a peaceful order in society.1.5 These Rules shall be implemented in the context of economic,social and cultural conditions prevailing in each Member State.1.6 Juvenile justice services shall be systematically developedand coordinated with a view to improving and sustaining thecompetence of personnel involved in the services, including theirmethods, approaches and attitudes.CommentaryThese broad fundamental perspectives refer to comprehensivesocial policy in general and aim at promoting juvenile welfare tothe greatest possible extent, which will minimize the necessityof intervention by the juvenile justice system, and in turn, willreduce the harm that may be caused by any intervention. Such caremeasures for the young, before the onset of delinquency, arebasic policy requisites designed to obviate the need for theapplication of the Rules.Rules 1.1 to 1.3 point to the important role that a constructivesocial policy for juveniles will play, inter alia, in theprevention of juvenile crime and delinquency. Rule 1.4 definesjuvenile justice as an integral part of social justice forjuveniles, while rule 1.6 refers to the necessity of constantlyimproving juvenile justice, without falling behind thedevelopment of progressive social policy for juveniles in generaland bearing in mind the need for consistent improvement of staffservices.Rule 1.5 seeks to take account of existing conditions in MemberStates which would cause the manner of implementation ofparticular rules necessarily to be different from the manneradopted in other States.2. Scope of the Rules and definitions used2.1 The following Standard Minimum Rules shall be applied tojuvenile offenders impartially, without distinction of any kind,for example as to race, colour, sex, language, religion,political or other opinions, national or social origin, property,birth or other status.2.2 For purposes of these Rules, the following definitions shallbe applied by Member States in a manner which is compatible withtheir respective legal systems and concepts:(a) A juvenile is a child or young person who, under therespective legal systems, may be dealt with for an offence in amanner which is different from an adult;(b) An offence is any behaviour (act or omission) that ispunishable by law under the respective legal systems;(c) A juvenile offender is a child or young person who is allegedto have committed or who has been found to have committed anoffence.2.3 Efforts shall be made to establish, in each nationaljurisdiction, a set of laws, rules and provisions specificallyapplicable to juvenile offenders and institutions and bodiesentrusted with the functions of the administration of juvenilejustice and designed:(a) To meet the varying needs of juvenile offenders, whileprotecting their basic rights;(b) To meet the needs of society;(c) To implement the following rules thoroughly and fairly.CommentaryThe Standard Minimum Rules are deliberately formulated so as tobe applicable within different legal systems and, at the sametime, to set some minimum standards for the handling of juvenileoffenders under any definition of a juvenile and under any systemof dealing with juvenile offenders. The Rules are always to beapplied impartially and without distinction of any kind.Rule 2.1 therefore stresses the importance of the Rules alwaysbeing applied impartially and without distinction of any kind.The rule follows the formulation of principle 2 of theDeclaration of the Rights of the Child.Rule 2.2 defines "juvenile" and "offence" as the components ofthe notion of the "juvenile offender", who is the main subject ofthese Standard Minimum Rules (see, however, also rules 3 and 4).It should be noted that age limits will depend on, and areexplicitly made dependent on, each respective legal system, thusfully respecting the economic, social, political, cultural andlegal systems of Member States. This makes for a wide variety ofages coming under the definition of "juvenile", ranging from 7years to 18 years or above. Such a variety seems inevitable inview of the different national legal systems and does notdiminish the impact of these Standard Minimum Rules.Rule 2.3 is addressed to the necessity of specific nationallegislation for the optimal implementation of these StandardMinimum Rules, both legally and practically.3. Extension of the Rules3.1 The relevant provisions of the Rules shall be applied notonly to juvenile offenders but also to juveniles who may beproceeded against for any specific behaviour that would not bepunishable if committed by an adult.3.2 Efforts shall be made to extend the principles embodied inthe Rules to all juveniles who are dealt with in welfare and careproceedings.3.3 Efforts shall also be made to extend the principles embodiedin the Rules to young adult offenders.CommentaryRule 3 extends the protection afforded by the Standard MinimumRules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice to cover:(a) The so-called "status offences" prescribed in variousnational legal systems where the range of behaviour considered tobe an offence is wider for juveniles than it is for adults (forexample, truancy, school and family disobedience, publicdrunkenness, etc.) (rule 3.1);(b) Juvenile welfare and care proceedings (rule 3.2);(c) Proceedings dealing with young adult offenders, depending ofcourse on each given age limit (rule 3.3).The extension of the Rules to cover these three areas seems to bejustified. Rule 3.1 provides minimum guarantees in those fields,and rule 3.2 is considered a desirable step in the direction ofmore fair, equitable and humane justice for all juveniles inconflict with the law.4. Age of criminal responsibility4.1 In those legal systems recognizing the concept of the age ofcriminal responsibility for juveniles, the beginning of that ageshall not be fixed at too low an age level, bearing in mind thefacts of emotional, mental and intellectual maturity.CommentaryThe minimum age of criminal responsibility differs widely owingto history and culture. The modern approach would be to considerwhether a child can live up to the moral and psychologicalcomponents of criminal responsibility; that is, whether a child,by virtue of her or his individual discernment and understanding,can be held responsible for essentially antisocial be ha vi our.If the age of criminal responsibility is fixed too low or ifthere is no lower age limit at all, the notion of responsibilitywould become meaningless. In general, there is a closerelationship between the notion of responsibility for delinquentor criminal behaviour and other social rights andresponsibilities (such as marital status, civil majority, etc.).Efforts should therefore be made to agree on a reasonable lowestage limit that is applicable internationally.5. Aims of juvenile justice5. 1 The juvenile justice system shall emphasize the well-beingof the juvenile and shall ensure that any reaction to juvenileoffenders shall always be in proportion to the circumstances ofboth the offenders and the offence.CommentaryRule 5 refers to two of the most important objectives of juvenilejustice. The first objective is the promotion of the well-beingof the juvenile. This is the main focus of those legal systems inwhich juvenile offenders are dealt with by family courts oradministrative authorities, but the well-being of the juvenileshould also be emphasized in legal systems that follow thecriminal court model, thus contributing to the avoidance ofmerely punitive sanctions. (See also rule 14.)The second objective is "the principle of proportionality". Thisprinciple is well-known as an instrument for curbing punitivesanctions, mostly expressed in terms of just deserts in relationto the gravity of the offence. The response to young offendersshould be based on the consideration not only of the gravity ofthe offence but also of personal circumstances. The individualcircumstances of the offender (for example social status, familysituation, the harm caused by the offence or other factorsaffecting personal circumstances) should influence theproportionality of the reactions (for example by having regard tothe offender's endeavour to indemnify the victim or to her or hiswillingness to turn to wholesome and useful life).By the same token, reactions aiming to ensure the welfare of theyoung offender may go beyond necessity and therefore infringeupon the fundamental rights of the young individual, as has beenobserved in some juvenile justice systems. Here, too, theproportionality of the reaction to the circumstances of both theoffender and the offence, including the victim, should besafeguarded.In essence, rule 5 calls for no less and no more than a fairreaction in any given cases of juvenile delinquency and crime.The issues combined in the rule may help to stimulate developmentin both regards: new and innovative types of reactions are asdesirable as precautions against any undue widening of the net offormal social control over juveniles.6. Scope of discretion6.1 In view of the varying special needs of juveniles as well asthe variety of measures available, appropriate scope fordiscretion shall be allowed at all stages of proceedings and atthe different levels of juvenile justice administration,including investigation, prosecution, adjudication and thefollow-up of dispositions.6.2 Efforts shall be made, however, to ensure sufficientaccountability at all stages and levels in the exercise of anysuch discretion.6.3 Those who exercise discretion shall be specially qualified ortrained to exercise it judiciously and in accordance with theirfunctions and mandates.CommentaryRules 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 combine several important features ofeffective, fair and humane juvenile justice administration: theneed to permit the exercise of discretionary power at allsignificant levels of processing so that those who makedeterminations can take the actions deemed to be most appropriatein each individual case; and the need to provide checks andbalances in order to curb any abuses of discretionary power andto safeguard the rights of the young offender. Accountability andprofessionalism are instruments best apt to curb broaddiscretion. Thus, professional qualifications and expert trainingare emphasized here as a valuable means of ensuring the judiciousexercise of discretion in matters of juvenile offenders. (Seealso rules 1.6 and 2.2.) The formulation of specific guidelineson the exercise of discretion and the provision of systems ofreview, appeal and the like in order to permit scrutiny ofdecisions and accountability are emphasized in this context. Suchmechanisms are not specified here, as they do not easily lendthemselves to incorporation into international standard minimumrules, which cannot possibly cover all differences in justicesystems.7. Rights of juveniles7.1 Basic procedural safeguards such as the presumption ofinnocence, the right to be notified of the charges, the right toremain silent, the right to counsel, the right to the presence ofa parent or guardian, the right to confront and cross-examinewitnesses and the right to appeal to a higher authority shall beguaranteed at all stages of proceedings.CommentaryRule 7.1 emphasizes some important points that representessential elements for a fair and just trial and that areinternationally recognized in existing human rights instruments.(See also rule 14.) The presumption of innocence, for instance,is also to be found in article 11 of the Universal Declaration ofHuman rights and in article 14, paragraph 2, of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.Rules 14 seq. of these Standard Minimum Rules specify issues thatare important for proceedings in juvenile cases, in particular,while rule 7.1 affirms the most basic procedural safeguards in ageneral way.8. Protection of privacy8.1 The juvenile's right to privacy shall be respected at allstages in order to avoid harm being caused to her or him by unduepublicity or by the process of labelling.8.2 In principle, no information that may lead to theidentification of a juvenile offender shall be published.CommentaryRule 8 stresses the importance of the protection of thejuvenile's right to privacy. Young persons are particularlysusceptible to stigmatization. Criminological research intolabelling processes has provided evidence of the detrimentaleffects (of different kinds) resulting from the permanentidentification of young persons as "delinquent" or "criminal".Rule 8 stresses the importance of protecting the juvenile fromthe adverse effects that may result from the publication in themass media of information about the case (for example the namesof young offenders, alleged or convicted). The interest of theindividual should be protected and upheld, at least in principle.(The general contents of rule 8 are further specified in rule 21.)9. Saving clause9.1 Nothing in these Rules shall be interpreted as precluding theapplication of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment ofPrisoners adopted by the United Nations and other human rightsinstruments and standards recognized by the internationalcommunity that relate to the care and protection of the young.CommentaryRule 9 is meant to avoid any misunderstanding in interpreting andimplementing the present Rules in conformity with principlescontained in relevant existing or emerging international humanrights instruments and standards-such as the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Declaration ofthe Rights of the Child and the draft convention on the rights ofthe child. It should be understood that the application of thepresent Rules is without prejudice to any such internationalinstruments which may contain provisions of wider application.(See also rule 27.)PART TWOINVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION10. Initial contact10.1 Upon the apprehension of a juvenile, her or his parents orguardian shall be immediately notified of such apprehension, and,where such immediate notification is not possible, the parents orguardian shall be notified within the shortest possible timethereafter.10.2 A judge or other competent official or body shall, withoutdelay, consider the issue of release.10.3 Contacts between the law enforcement agencies and a juvenileoffender shall be managed in such a way as to respect the legalstatus of the juvenile, promote the well-being of the juvenileand avoid harm to her or hi m, with due regard to thecircumstances of the case.CommentaryRule 10.1 is in principle contained in rule 92 of the StandardMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.The question of release (rule 10.2) shall be considered withoutdelay by a judge or other competent official. The latter refersto any person or institution in the broadest sense of the term,including community boards or police authorities having power torelease an arrested person. (See also the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights, article 9, paragraph 3.)Rule 10.3 deals with some fundamental aspects of the proceduresand behaviour on the part of the police and other law enforcementofficials in cases of juvenile crime. To "avoid harm" admittedlyis flexible wording and covers many features of possibleinteraction (for example the use of harsh language, physicalviolence or exposure to the environment). Involvement in juvenilejustice processes in itself can be "harmful" to juveniles; theterm "avoid harm" should be broadly interpreted, therefore, asdoing the least harm possible to the juvenile in the firstinstance, as well as any additional or undue harm. This isespecially important in the initial contact with law enforcementagencies, which might profoundly influence the juvenile'sattitude towards the State and society. Moreover, the success ofany further intervention is largely dependent on such initialcontacts. Compassion and kind firmness are important in thesesituations.11. Diversion11.1 Consideration shall be given, wherever appropriate, todealing with juvenile offenders without resorting to formal trialby the competent authority, referred to in rule 14.1 below.11.2 The police, the prosecution or other agencies dealing withjuvenile cases shall be empowered to dispose of such cases, attheir discretion, without recourse to formal hearings, inaccordance with the criteria laid down for that purpose in therespective legal system and also in accordance with theprinciples contained in these Rules.11.3 Any diversion involving referral to appropriate community orother services shall require the consent of the juvenile, or heror his parents or guardian, provided that such decision to refera case shall be subject to review by a competent authority, uponapplication.11.4 In order to facilitate the discretionary disposition ofjuvenile cases, efforts shall be made to provide for communityprogrammes, such as temporary supervision and guidance,restitution, and compensation of victims.CommentaryDiversion, involving removal from criminal justice processingand, frequently, redirection to community support services, iscommonly practised on a formal and informal basis in many legalsystems. This practice serves to hinder the negative effects ofsubsequent proceedings in juvenile justice administration (forexample the stigma of conviction and sentence). In many cases,non-intervention would be the best response. Thus, diversion atthe outset and without referral to alternative (social) servicesmay be the optimal response. This is especially the case wherethe offence is of a non-serious nature and where the family, theschool or other informal social control institutions have alreadyreacted, or are likely to react, in an appropriate andconstructive manner.As stated in rule 11.2, diversion may be used at any point ofdecision-making-by the police, the prosecution or other agenciessuch as the courts, tribunals, boards or councils. It may beexercised by one authority or several or all authorities,according to the rules and policies of the respective systems andin line with the present Rules. It need not necessarily belimited to petty cases, thus rendering diversion an importantinstrument.Rule 11.3 stresses the important requirement of securing theconsent of the young offender (or the parent or guardian) to therecommended diversionary measure(s). (Diversion to communityservice without such consent would contradict the Abolition ofForced Labour Convention.) However, this consent should not beleft unchallengeable, since it might sometimes be given out ofsheer desperation on the part of the juvenile. The ruleunderlines that care should be taken to minimize the potentialfor coercion and intimidation at all levels in the diversionprocess. Juveniles should not feel pressured (for example inorder to avoid court appearance) or be pressured into consentingto diversion programmes. Thus, it is advocated that provisionshould be made for an objective appraisal of the appropriatenessof dispositions involving young offenders by a "competentauthority upon application". (The "competent authority,' may bedifferent from that referred to in rule 14.)Rule 11.4 recommends the provision of viable alternatives tojuvenile justice processing in the form of community-baseddiversion. Programmes that involve settlement by victimrestitution and those that seek to avoid future conflict with thelaw through temporary supervision and guidance are especiallycommended. The merits of individual cases would make diversionappropriate, even when more serious offences have been committed(for example first offence, the act having been committed underpeer pressure, etc.).12. Specialization within the police12.1 In order to best fulfil their functions, police officers whofrequently or exclusively deal with juveniles or who areprimarily engaged in the prevention of juvenile crime shall bespecially instructed and trained. In large cities, special policeunits should be established for that purpose.CommentaryRule 12 draws attention to the need for specialized training forall law enforcement officials who are involved in theadministration of juvenile justice. As police are the first pointof contact with the juvenile justice system, it is most importantthat they act in an informed and appropriate manner.While the relationship between urbanization and crime is clearlycomplex, an increase in juvenile crime has been associated withthe growth of large cities, particularly with rapid and unplannedgrowth. Specialized police units would therefore beindispensable, not only in the interest of implementing specificprinciples contained in the present instrument (such as rule 1.6)but more generally for improving the prevention and control ofjuvenile crime and the handling of juvenile offenders.13. Detention pending trial13.1 Detention pending trial shall be used only as a measure oflast resort and for the shortest possible period of time.13.2 Whenever possible, detention pending trial shall be replacedby alternative measures, such as close supervision, intensivecare or placement with a family or in an educational setting orhome.13.3 Juveniles under detention pending trial shall be entitled toall rights and guarantees of the Standard Minimum Rules for theTreatment of Prisoners adopted by the United Nations.13.4 Juveniles under detention pending trial shall be keptseparate from adults and shall be detained in a separateinstitution or in a separate part of an institution also holdingadults.13.5 While in custody, juveniles shall receive care, protectionand all necessary individual assistance-social, educational,vocational, psychological, medical and physical-that they mayrequire in view of their age, sex and personality.CommentaryThe danger to juveniles of"criminal contamination" while indetention pending trial must not be underestimated. It istherefore important to stress the need for alternative measures.By doing so, rule 13.1 encourages the devising of new andinnovative measures to avoid such detention in the interest ofthe well-being of the juvenile. Juveniles under detention pendingtrial are entitled to all the rights and guarantees of theStandard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners as well asthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,especially article 9 and article 10, paragraphs 2 (b) and 3.Rule 13.4 does not prevent States from taking other measuresagainst the negative influences of adult offenders which are atleast as effective as the measures mentioned in the rule.Different forms of assistance that may become necessary have beenenumerated to draw attention to the broad range of particularneeds of young detainees to be addressed (for example females ormales, drug addicts, alcoholics, mentally ill juveniles, youngpersons suffering from the trauma, for example, of arrest, etc.).Varying physical and psychological characteristics of youngdetainees may warrant classification measures by which some arekept separate while in detention pending trial, thus contributingto the avoidance of victimization and rendering more appropriateassistance.The Sixth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime andthe Treatment of Offenders, in its resolution 4 on juvenilejustice standards, specified that the Rules, inter alia, shouldreflect the basic principle that pre-trial detention should beused only as a last resort, that no minors should be held in afacility where they are vulnerable to the negative influences ofadult detainees and that account should always be taken of theneeds particular to their stage of development.PART THREEADJUDICATION AND DISPOSITION14. Competent authority to adjudicate14.1 Where the case of a juvenile offender has not been diverted(under rule 11), she or he shall be dealt with by the competentauthority (court, tribunal, board, council, etc.) according tothe principles of a fair and just trial.14.2 The proceedings shall be conducive to the best interests ofthe juvenile and shall be conducted in an atmosphere ofunderstanding, which shall allow the juvenile to participatetherein and to express herself or himself freely.CommentaryIt is difficult to formulate a definition of the competent bodyor person that would universally describe an adjudicatingauthority. "Competent authority" is meant to include those whopreside over courts or tribunals (composed of a single judge orof several members), including professional and lay magistratesas well as administrative boards (for example the Scottish andScandinavian systems) or other more informal community andconflict resolution agencies of an adjudicatory nature.The procedure for dealing with juvenile offenders shall in anycase follow the minimum standards that are applied almostuniversally for any criminal defendant under the procedure knownas "due process of law". In accordance with due process, a "fairand just trial" includes such basic safeguards as the presumptionof innocence, the presentation and examination of witnesses, thecommon legal defences, the right to remain silent, the right tohave the last word in a hearing, the right to appeal, etc. (Seealso rule 7.1.)15. Legal counsel, parents and guardians15.1 Throughout the proceedings the juvenile shall have the rightto be represented by a legal adviser or to apply for free legalaid where there is provision for such aid in the country.15.2 The parents or the guardian shall be entitled to participatein the proceedings and may be required by the competent authorityto attend them in the interest of the juvenile. They may,however, be denied participation by the competent authority ifthere are reasons to assume that such exclusion is necessary inthe interest of the juvenile.CommentaryRule 15.1 uses terminology similar to that found in rule 93 ofthe Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.Whereas legal counsel and free legal aid are needed to assure thejuvenile legal assistance, the right of the parents or guardianto participate as stated in rule 15.2 should be viewed as generalpsychological and emotional assistance to the juvenile-a functionextending throughout the procedure.The competent authority's search for an adequate disposition ofthe case may pro fit, in particular, fro m the co-operation ofthe legal representatives of the juvenile (or, for that matter,some other personal assistant who the juvenile can and doesreally trust). Such concern can be thwarted if the presence ofparents or guardians at the hearings plays a negative role, forinstance, if they display a hostile attitude towards thejuvenile, hence, the possibility of their exclusion must beprovided for.16. Social inquiry reports16.1 In all cases except those involving minor offences, beforethe competent authority renders a final disposition prior tosentencing, the background and circumstances in which thejuvenile is living or the conditions under which the offence hasbeen committed shall be properly investigated so as to facilitatejudicious adjudication of the case by the competent authority.CommentarySocial inquiry reports (social reports or pre-sentence reports)are an indispensable aid in most legal proceedings involvingjuveniles. The competent authority should be informed of relevantfacts about the juvenile, such as social an d family background,school career, educational experiences, etc. For this purpose,some jurisdictions use special social services or personnelattached to the court or board. Other personnel, includingprobation officers, may serve the same function. The ruletherefore requires that adequate social services should beavailable to deliver social inquiry reports of a qualifiednature.17. Guiding principles in adjudication and disposition17.1 The disposition of the competent authority shall be guidedby the following principles:(a) The reaction taken shall always be in proportion not only tothe circumstances and the gravity of the offence but also to thecircumstances and the needs of the juvenile as well as to theneeds of the society;(b) Restrictions on the personal liberty of the juvenile shall beimposed only after careful consideration and shall be limited tothe possible minimum;(c) Deprivation of personal liberty shall not be imposed unlessthe juvenile is adjudicated of a serious act involving violenceagainst another person or of persistence in committing otherserious offences and unless there is no other appropriateresponse;(d) The well-being of the juvenile shall be the guiding factor inthe consideration of her or his case.17.2 Capital punishment shall not be imposed for any crimecommitted by juveniles.17.3 Juveniles shall not be subject to corporal punishment.17.4 The competent authority shall have the power to discontinuethe proceedings at any time.CommentaryThe main difficulty in formulating guidelines for theadjudication of young persons stems from the fact that there areunresolved conflicts of a philosophical nature, such as thefollowing:(a) Rehabilitation versus just desert;(b) Assistance versus repression and punishment;(c) Reaction according to the singular merits of an individualcase versus reaction according to the protection of society ingeneral;(d) General deterrence versus individual incapacitation.The conflict between these approaches is more pronounced injuvenile cases than in adult cases. With the variety of causesand reactions characterizing juvenile cases, these alternativesbecome intricately interwoven.It is not the function of the Standard Minimum Rules for theAdministration of Juvenile Justice to prescribe which approach isto be followed but rather to identify one that is most closely inconsonance with internationally accepted principles. Thereforethe essential elements as laid down in rule 17.1 , in particularin subparagraphs (a) and (c), are mainly to be understood aspractical guidelines that should ensure a common starting point;if heeded by the concerned authorities (see also rule 5), theycould contribute considerably to ensuring that the fundamentalrights of juvenile offenders are protected, especially thefundamental rights of personal development and education.Rule 17.1 (b) implies that strictly punitive approaches are notappropriate. Whereas in adult cases, and possibly also in casesof severe offences by juveniles, just desert and retributivesanctions might be considered to have some merit, in juvenilecases such considerations should always be outweighed by theinterest of safeguarding the well-being and the future of theyoung person.In line with resolution 8 of the Sixth United Nations Congress,rule 17.1 (b) encourages the use of alternatives toinstitutionalization to the maximum extent possible, bearing inmind the need to respond to the specific requirements of theyoung. Thus, full use should be made of the range of existingalternative sanctions and new alternative sanctions should bedeveloped, bearing the public safety in mind. Probation should begranted to the greatest possible extent via suspended sentences,conditional sentences, board orders and other dispositions.Rule 17.1 (c) corresponds to one of the guiding principles inresolution 4 of the Sixth Congress which aims at avoidingincarceration in the case of juveniles unless there is no otherappropriate response that will protect the public safety.The provision prohibiting capital punishment in rule 17.2 is inaccordance with article 6, paragraph 5, of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.The provision against corporal punishment is in line with article7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights andthe Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from BeingSubjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment, as well as the Convention againstTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment orPunishment and the draft convention on the rights of the child.The power to discontinue the proceedings at any time (rule 17.4)is a characteristic inherent in the handling of juvenileoffenders as opposed to adults. At any time, circumstances maybecome known to the competent authority which would make acomplete cessation of the intervention appear to be the bestdisposition of the case.18. Various disposition measures18.1 A large variety of disposition measures shall be madeavailable to the competent authority, allowing for flexibility soas to avoid institutionalization to the greatest extent possible.Such measures, some of which may be combined, include:(a) Care, guidance and supervision orders;(b) Probation;(c) Community service orders;(d) Financial penalties, compensation and restitution;(e) Intermediate treatment and other treatment orders;(f) Orders to participate in group counselling and similaractivities;(g) Orders concerning foster care, living communities or othereducational settings;(h) Other relevant orders.18.2 No juvenile shall be removed from parental supervision,whether partly or entire l y, unless the circumstances of her orhis case make this necessary.CommentaryRule 18.1 attempts to enumerate some of the important reactionsand sanctions that have been practised and proved successful thusfar, in different legal systems. On the whole they representpromising opinions that deserve replication and furtherdevelopment. The rule does not enumerate staffing requirementsbecause of possible shortages of adequate staff in some regions;in those regions measures requiring less staff may be tried ordeveloped.The examples given in rule 18.1 have in common, above all, areliance on and an appeal to the community for the effectiveimplementation of alternative dispositions. Community-basedcorrection is a traditional measure that has taken on manyaspects. On that basis, relevant authorities should be encouragedto offer community-based services.Rule 18.2 points to the importance of the family which, accordingto article 10, paragraph l, of the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, is "the natural andfundamental group unit of society". Within the family, theparents have not only the right but also the responsibility tocare for and supervise their children. Rule 18.2, therefore,requires that the separation of children from their parents is ameasure of last resort. It may be resorted to only when the factsof the case clearly warrant this grave step (for example childabuse).19. Least possible use of institutionalization19.1 The placement of a juvenile in an institution shall alwaysbe a disposition of last resort and for the minimum necessaryperiod.CommentaryProgressive criminology advocates the use of non-institutionalover institutional treatment. Little or no difference has beenfound in terms of the success of institutionalization as comparedto non-institutionalization. The many adverse influences on anindividual that seem unavoidable within any institutional settingevidently cannot be outbalanced by treatment efforts. This isespecially the case for juveniles, who are vulnerable to negativeinfluences. Moreover, the negative effects, not only of loss ofliberty but also of separation from the usual social environment,are certainly more acute for juveniles than for adults because oftheir early stage of development.Rule 19 aims at restricting institutionalization in two regards:in quantity ("last resort,,) and in time ("minimum necessaryperiod"). Rule 19 reflects one of the basic guiding principles ofresolution 4 of the Sixth United Nations Congress: a juvenileoffender should not be incarcerated unless there is no otherappropriate response. The rule, therefore, makes the appeal thatif a juvenile must be institutionalized, the loss of libertyshould be restricted to the least possible degree, with specialinstitutional arrangements for confinement and bearing in mindthe differences in kinds of offenders, offences and institutions.In fact, priority should be given to "open" over "closed"institutions. Furthermore, any facility should be of acorrectional or educational rather than of a prison type.20. Avoidance of unnecessary delay20.1 Each case shall from the outset be handled expeditiously,without any unnecessary delay.CommentaryThe speedy conduct of formal procedures in juvenile cases is aparamount concern. Otherwise whatever good may be achieved by theprocedure and the disposition is at risk. As time passes, thejuvenile will find it increasingly difficult, if not impossible,to relate the procedure and disposition to the offence, bothintellectually and psychologically.21. Records21.1 Records of juvenile offenders shall be kept strictlyconfidential and closed to third parties. Access to such recordsshall be limited to persons directly concerned with thedisposition of the case at hand or other duly authorized persons.21.2 Records of juvenile offenders shall not be used in adultproceedings in subsequent cases involving the same offender.CommentaryThe rule attempts to achieve a balance between conflictinginterests connected with records or files: those of the police,prosecution and other authorities in improving control versus theinterests of the juvenile offender. (See also rule 8.) "Otherduly authorized persons" would generally include among others,researchers.22. Need for professionalism and training22.1 Professional education, in-service training, refreshercourses and other appropriate modes of instruction shall beutilized to establish and maintain the necessary professionalcompetence of all personnel dealing with juvenile cases.22.2 Juvenile justice personnel shall reflect the diversity ofjuveniles who come into contact with the juvenile justice system.Efforts shall be made to ensure the fair representation of womenand minorities in juvenile justice agencies.CommentaryThe authorities competent for disposition may be persons withvery different backgrounds (magistrates in the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland and in regions influenced bythe common law system; legally trained judges in countries usingRoman law and in regions influenced by them; and elsewhereelected or appointed laymen or jurists, members ofcommunity-based boards, etc.). For all these authorities, aminimum training in law, sociology, psychology, criminology andbehavioural sciences would be required. This is considered asimportant as the organizational specialization and independenceof the competent authority.For social workers and probation officers, it might not befeasible to require professional specialization as a prerequisitefor taking over any function dealing with juvenile offenders.Thus, professional on-the job instruction would be minimumqualifications.Professional qualifications are an essential element in ensuringthe impartial and effective administration of juvenile justice.Accordingly, it is necessary to improve the recruitment,advancement and professional training of personnel and to providethem with the necessary means to enable them to properly fulfiltheir functions.All political, social, sexual, racial, religious, cultural or anyother kind of discrimination in the selection, appointment andadvancement of juvenile justice personnel should be avoided inorder to achieve impartiality in the administration of juvenilejustice. This was recommended by the Sixth Congress. Furthermore,the Sixth Congress called on Member States to ensure the fair andequal treatment of women as criminal justice personnel andrecommended that special measures should be taken to recruit,train and facilitate the advancement of female personnel injuvenile justice administration.PART FOURNON-INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT23. Effective implementation of disposition23.1 Appropriate provisions shall be made for the implementationof orders of the competent authority, as referred to in rule 14.1above, by that authority itself or by some other authority ascircumstances may require23.2 Such provisions shall include the power to modify the ordersas the competent authority may deem necessary from time to time,provided that such modification shall be determined in accordancewith the principles contained in these Rules.CommentaryDisposition in juvenile cases, more so than in adult cases, tendsto influence the offender's life for a long period of time. Thus,it is important that the competent authority or an independentbody (parole board, probation office, youth welfare institutionsor others) with qualifications equal to those of the competentauthority that originally disposed of the case should monitor theimplementation of the disposition. In some countries, a juge del'execution des peines has been installed for this purpose.The composition, powers and functions of the authority must beflexible; they are described in general terms in rule 23 in orderto ensure wide acceptability.24. Provision of needed assistance24.1 Efforts shall be made to provide juveniles, at all stages ofthe proceedings, with necessary assistance such as lodging,education or vocational training, employment or any otherassistance, helpful and practical, in order to facilitate therehabilitative process.CommentaryThe promotion of the well-being of the juvenile is of paramountconsideration. Thus, rule 24 emphasizes the importance ofproviding requisite facilities, services and other necessaryassistance as may further the best interests of the juvenilethroughout the rehabilitative process.25. Mobilization of volunteers and other community services25.1 Volunteers, voluntary organizations, local institutions andother community resources shall be called upon to contributeeffectively to the rehabilitation of the juvenile in a communitysetting and, as far as possible, within the family unit.CommentaryThis rule reflects the need for a rehabilitative orientation ofall work with juvenile offenders. Co-operation with the communityis indispensable if the directives of the competent authority areto be carried out effectively. Volunteers and voluntary services,in particular, have proved to be valuable resources but are atpresent underutilized. In some instances, the co-operation ofex-offenders (including ex-addicts) can be of considerableassistance.Rule 25 emanates from the principles laid down in rules 1.1 to1.6 and follows the relevant provisions of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.PART FIVEINSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT26. Objectives of institutional treatment26.1 The objective of training and treatment of juveniles placedin institutions is to provide care, protection, education andvocational skills, with a view to assisting them to assumesocially constructive and productive roles in society.26.2 Juveniles in institutions shall receive care, protection andall necessary assistance-social, educational, vocational,psychological, medical and physical-that they may require becauseof their age, sex, and personality and in the interest of theirwholesome development .26.3 Juveniles in institutions shall be kept separate from adultsand shall be detained in a separate institution or in a separatepart of an institution also holding adults.26.4 Young female offenders placed in an institution deservespecial attention as to their personal needs and problems. Theyshall by no means receive less care, protection, assistance,treatment and training than young male offenders. Their fairtreatment shall be ensured.26.5 In the interest and well-being of the institutionalizedjuvenile, the parents or guardians shall have a right of access.26.6 Inter-ministerial and inter-departmental co-operation shallbe fostered for the purpose of providing adequate academic or, asappropriate, vocational training to institutionalized juveniles,with a view to ensuring that they do not leave the institution atan educational disadvantage.CommentaryThe objectives of institutional treatment as stipulated in rules26.1 and 26.2 would be acceptable to any system and culture.However, they have not yet been attained everywhere, and muchmore has to be done in this respect.Medical and psychological assistance, in particular, areextremely important for institutionalized drug addicts, violentand mentally ill young persons.The avoidance of negative influences through adult offenders andthe safeguarding of the well-being of juveniles in aninstitutional setting, as stipulated in rule 26.3, are in linewith one of the basic guiding principles of the Rules, as set outby the Sixth Congress in its resolution 4. The rule does notprevent States from taking other measures against the negativeinfluences of adult offenders, which are at least as effective asthe measures mentioned in the rule. (See also rule 13.4)Rule 26.4 addresses the fact that female offenders normallyreceive less attention than their male counterparts. as pointedout by the Sixth Congress. In particular, resolution 9 of theSixth Congress calls for the fair treatment of female offendersat every stage of criminal justice processes and for specialattention to their particular problems and needs while incustody. Moreover, this rule should also be considered in thelight of the Caracas Declaration of the Sixth Congress, which,inter alia, calls for equal treatment in criminal justiceadministration, and against the background of the Declaration onthe Elimination of Discrimination against Women and theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminationagainst Women.The right of access (rule 26.5) follows from the provisions ofrules 7.1, 10.1, 15.2 and 18.2. Inter-ministerial andinter-departmental co-operation (rule 26.6) are of particularimportance in the interest of generally enhancing the quality ofinstitutional treatment and training.27. Application of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatmentof Prisoners adopted by the United Nations27.1 The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisonersand related recommendations shall be applicable as far asrelevant to the treatment of juvenile offenders in institutions,including those in detention pending adjudication.27.2 Efforts shall be made to implement the relevant principleslaid down in the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment ofPrisoners to the largest possible extent so as to meet thevarying needs of juveniles specific to their age, sex andpersonality.CommentaryThe Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners wereamong the first instruments of this kind to be promulgated by theUnited Nations. It is generally agreed that they have had aworld-wide impact. Although there are still countries whereimplementation is more an aspiration than a fact, those StandardMinimum Rules continue to be an important influence in the humaneand equitable administration of correctional institutions.Some essential protections covering juvenile offenders ininstitutions are contained in the Standard Minimum Rules for theTreatment of Prisoners (accommodation, architecture, bedding,clothing, complaints and requests, contact with the outsideworld, food, medical care, religious service, separation of ages,staffing, work, etc.) as are provisions concerning punishment anddiscipline, and restraint for dangerous offenders. It would notbe appropriate to modify those Standard Minimum Rules accordingto the particular characteristics of institutions for juvenileoffenders within the scope of the Standard Minimum Rules for theAdministration of Juvenile Justice.Rule 27 focuses on the necessary requirements for juveniles ininstitutions (rule 27.1) as well as on the varying needs specificto their age, sex and personality (rule 27.2). Thus, theobjectives and content of the rule interrelate to the relevantprovisions of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment ofPrisoners.28. Frequent and early recourse to conditional release28.1 Conditional release from an institution shall be used by theappropriate authority to the greatest possible extent, and shallbe granted at the earliest possible time.28.2 Juveniles released conditionally from an institution shallbe assisted and supervised by an appropriate authority and shallreceive full support by the community.CommentaryThe power to order conditional release may rest with thecompetent authority, as mentioned in rule 14.1 or with some otherauthority. In view of this, it is adequate to refer here to the"appropriate,' rather than to the "competent" authority.Circumstances permitting, conditional release shall be preferredto serving a full sentence. Upon evidence of satisfactoryprogress towards rehabilitation, even offenders who had beendeemed dangerous at the time of their institutionalization can beconditionally released whenever feasible. Like probation , suchrelease may be conditional on the satisfactory fulfilment of therequirements specified by the relevant authorities for a periodof time established in the decision, for example relating to"good behaviour" of the offender, attendance in communityprogrammes, residence in half-way houses, etc.In the case of offenders conditionally released from aninstitution, assistance and supervision by a probation or otherofficer (particularly where probation has not yet been adopted)should be provided and community support should be encouraged.29. Semi-institutional arrangements29.1 Efforts shall be made to provide semi-institutionalarrangements, such as half-way houses, educational homes,day-time training centres and other such appropriate arrangementsthat may assist juveniles in their proper reintegration intosociety.CommentaryThe importance of care following a period of institutionalizationshould not be underestimated. This rule emphasizes the necessityof forming a net of semi-institutional arrangements.This rule also emphasizes the need for a diverse range offacilities and services designed to meet the different needs ofyoung offenders re-entering the community and to provide guidanceand structural support as an important step towards successfulreintegration into society.PART SIXRESEARCH, PLANNING, POLICY FORMULATION AND EVALUATION30. Research as a basis for planning, policy formulation andevaluation30.1 Efforts shall be made to organize and promote necessaryresearch as a basis for effective planning and policyformulation.30.2 Efforts shall be made to review and appraise periodicallythe trends, problems and causes of juvenile delinquency and crimeas well as the varying particular needs of juveniles in custody.30.3 Efforts shall be made to establish a regular evaluativeresearch mechanism built into the system of juvenile justiceadministration and to collect and analyse relevant data andinformation for appropriate assessment and future improvement andreform of the administration.30.4 The delivery of services in juvenile justice administrationshall be systematically planned and implemented as an integralpart of national development efforts.CommentaryThe utilization of research as a basis for an informed juvenilejustice policy is widely acknowledged as an important mechanismfor keeping practices abreast of advances in knowledge and thecontinuing development and improvement of the juvenile justicesystem. The mutual feedback between research and policy isespecially important in juvenile justice. With rapid and oftendrastic changes in the life-styles of the young and in the formsand dimensions of juvenile crime, the societal and justiceresponses to juvenile crime and delinquency quickly becomeoutmoded and inadequate.Rule 30 thus establishes standards for integrating research intothe process of policy formulation and application in juvenilejustice administration. The rule draws particular attention tothe need for regular review and evaluation of existing programmesand measures and for planning within the broader context ofoverall development objectives.A constant appraisal of the needs of juveniles, as well as thetrends and problems of delinquency, is a prerequisite forimproving the methods of formulating appropriate policies andestablishing adequate interventions, at both formal and informallevels. In this context, research by independent persons andbodies should be facilitated by responsible agencies, and it maybe valuable to obtain and to take into account the views ofjuveniles themselves, not only those who come into contact withthe system.The process of planning must particularly emphasize a moreeffective and equitable system for the delivery of necessaryservices. Towards that end, there should be a comprehensive andregular assessment of the wide-ranging, particular needs andproblems of juveniles and an identification of clear-cut priorities. In that connection, there should also be a co-ordination inthe use of existing resources, including alternatives andcommunity support that would be suitable in setting up specificprocedures designed to implement and monitor establishedprogrammes.APPENDIX IV: UNITED NATIONS GUIDELINES FOR THEPREVENTION OFJUVENILE DELINQUENCYUnited Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of JuvenileDelinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines), G.A. res. 45/112, annex, 45U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 49A) at 201, U.N. Doc. A/45/49 (1990).I. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES1. The prevention of juvenile delinquency is an essential part ofcrime prevention in society. By engaging in lawful, sociallyuseful activities and adopting a humanistic orientation towardssociety and outlook on life, young persons can developnon-criminogenic attitudes.2. The successful prevention of juvenile delinquency requiresefforts on the part of the entire society to ensure theharmonious development of adolescents, with respect for andpromotion of their personality from early childhood.3. For the purposes of the interpretation of the presentGuidelines, a child-centred orientation should be pursued. Youngpersons should have an active role and partnership within societyand should not be considered as mere objects of socialization orcontrol.4. In the implementation of the present Guidelines, in accordancewith national legal systems, the well-being of young persons fromtheir early childhood should be the focus of any preventiveprogramme.5. The need for and importance of progressive delinquencyprevention policies and the systematic study and the elaborationof measures should be recognized. These should avoidcriminalizing and penalizing a child for behaviour that does notcause serious damage to the development of the child or harm toothers. Such policies and measures should involve:(a) The provision of opportunities, in particular educationalopportunities, to meet the varying needs of young persons and toserve as a supportive framework for safeguarding the personaldevelopment of all young persons, particularly those who aredemonstrably endangered or at social risk and are in need ofspecial care and protection;(b) Specialized philosophies and approaches for delinquencyprevention, on the basis of laws, processes, institutions,facilities and a service delivery network aimed at reducing themotivation, need and opportunity for, or conditions giving riseto, the commission of infractions;(c) Official intervention to be pursued primarily in the overallinterest of the young person and guided by fairness and equity;(d) Safeguarding the well-being, development, rights andinterests of all young persons;(e) Consideration that youthful behaviour or conduct that doesnot conform to overall social norms and values is often part ofthe maturation and growth process and tends to disappearspontaneously in most individuals with the transition toadulthood;(f) Awareness that, in the predominant opinion of experts,labelling a young person as "deviant'', "delinquent" or"pre-delinquent" often contributes to the development of aconsistent pattern of undesirable behaviour by young persons.6. Community-based services and programmes should bedeveloped for the prevention of juvenile delinquency, particularly where noagencies have yet been established. Formal agencies of socialcontrol should only be utilized as a means of last resort.II. SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES7. The present Guidelines should be interpreted and implementedwithin the broad framework of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social andCultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child andthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in the context ofthe United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for theAdministration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules), as well as otherinstruments and norms relating to the rights, interests andwell-being of all children and young persons.8. The present Guidelines should also be implemented in thecontext of the economic, social and cultural conditionsprevailing in each Member State.III. GENERAL PREVENTION9. Comprehensive prevention plans should be instituted at everylevel of Government and include the following:(a) In-depth analyses of the problem and inventories ofprogrammes, services, facilities and resources available;(b) Well-defined responsibilities for the qualified agencies,institutions and personnel involved in preventive efforts;(c) Mechanisms for the appropriate co-ordination of preventionefforts between governmental and non-governmental agencies;(d) Policies, programmes and strategies based on prognosticstudies to be continuously monitored and carefully evaluated inthe course of implementation;(e) Methods for effectively reducing the opportunity to commitdelinquent acts;(f) Community involvement through a wide range of services andprogrammes;(g) Close interdisciplinary co-operation between national, State,provincial and local governments, with the involvement of theprivate sector representative citizens of the community to beserved, and labour, child-care, health education, social, lawenforcement and judicial agencies in taking concerted action toprevent juvenile delinquency and youth crime;(h) Youth participation in delinquency prevention policies andprocesses, including recourse to community resources, youthself-help, and victim compensation and assistance programmes;(i) Specialized personnel at all levels.IV. SOCIALIZATION PROCESSES10. Emphasis should be placed on preventive policies facilitatingthe successful socialization and integration of all children andyoung persons, in particular through the family, the community,peer groups, schools, vocational training and the world of work,as well as through voluntary organizations. Due respect should begiven to the proper personal development of children and youngpersons, and they should be accepted as full and equal partnersin socialization and integration processes.A. Family11. Every society should place a high priority on the needs andwell-being of the family and of all its members.12. Since the family is the central unit responsible for theprimary socialization of children, governmental and socialefforts to preserve the integrity of the family, including theextended family, should be pursued. The society has aresponsibility to assist the family in providing care andprotection and in ensuring the physical and mental well-being ofchildren. Adequate arrangements including day-care should beprovided.13. Governments should establish policies that are conducive tothe bringing up of children in stable and settled familyenvironments. Families in need of assistance in the resolution ofconditions of instability or conflict should be provided withrequisite services.14. Where a stable and settled family environment is lacking andwhen community efforts to assist parents in this regard havefailed and the extended family cannot fulfil this role,alternative placements, including foster care and adoption,should be considered. Such placements should replicate, to theextent possible, a stable and settled family environment, while,at the same time, establishing a sense of permanency forchildren, thus avoiding problems associated with "foster drift".15. Special attention should be given to children of familiesaffected by problems brought about by rapid and uneven economic,social and cultural change, in particular the children ofindigenous, migrant and refugee families. As such changes maydisrupt the social capacity of the family to secure thetraditional rearing and nurturing of children, often as a resultof role and culture conflict, innovative and sociallyconstructive modalities for the socialization of children have tobe designed.16. Measures should be taken and programmes developed toprovide families with the opportunity to learn about parental roles andobligations as regards child development and child care,promoting positive parent-child relationships, sensitizingparents to the problems of children and young persons andencouraging their involvement in family and community-basedactivities.17. Governments should take measures to promote family cohesionand harmony and to discourage the separation of children fromtheir parents, unless circumstances affecting the welfare andfuture of the child leave no viable alternative.18. It is important to emphasize the socialization function ofthe family and extended family; it is also equally important torecognize the future role, responsibilities, participation andpartnership of young persons in society.19. In ensuring the right of the child to proper socialization,Governments and other agencies should rely on existing social andlegal agencies, but, whenever traditional institutions andcustoms are no longer effective, they should also provide andallow for innovative measures.B. Education20. Governments are under an obligation to make public educationaccessible to all young persons.21. Education systems should, in addition to their academic andvocational training activities, devote particular attention tothe following:(a) Teaching of basic values and developing respect for thechild's own cultural identity and patterns, for the social valuesof the country in which the child is living, for civilizationsdifferent from the child's own and for human rights andfundamental freedoms;(b) Promotion and development of the personality, talents andmental and physical abilities of young people to their fullestpotential;(c) Involvement of young persons as active and effectiveparticipants in, rather than mere objects of, the educationalprocess;(d) Undertaking activities that foster a sense of identity withand of belonging to the school and the community;(e) Encouragement of young persons to understand and respectdiverse views and opinions, as well as cultural and otherdifferences;(f) Provision of information and guidance regarding vocationaltraining, employment opportunities and career development;(g) Provision of positive emotional support to young persons andthe avoidance of psychological maltreatment;(h) Avoidance of harsh disciplinary measures, particularlycorporal punishment.22. Educational systems should seek to work together withparents, community organizations and agencies concerned with theactivities of young persons.23. Young persons and their families should be informed about thelaw and their rights and responsibilities under the law, as wellas the universal value system, including United Nationsinstruments.24. Educational systems should extend particular care andattention to young persons who are at social risk. Specializedprevention programmes and educational materials, curricula,approaches and tools should be developed and fully utilized.25. Special attention should be given to comprehensive policiesand strategies for the prevention of alcohol, drug and othersubstance abuse by young persons. Teachers and otherprofessionals should be equipped and trained to prevent and dealwith these problems. Information on the use and abuse of drugs,including alcohol, should be made available to the student body.26. Schools should serve as resource and referral centres for theprovision of medical, counselling and other services to youngpersons, particularly those with special needs and suffering fromabuse, neglect, victimization and exploitation.27. Through a variety of educational programmes, teachers andother adults and the student body should be sensitized to theproblems, needs and perceptions of young persons, particularlythose belonging to underprivileged, disadvantaged, ethnic orother minority and low-income groups.28. School systems should attempt to meet and promote the highestprofessional and educational standards with respect to curricula,teaching and learning methods and approaches, and the recruitmentand training of qualified teachers. Regular monitoring andassessment of performance by the appropriate professionalorganizations and authorities should be ensured.29. School systems should plan, develop and implementextracurricular activities of interest to young persons, inco-operation with community groups.30. Special assistance should be given to children and youngpersons who find it difficult to comply with attendance codes,and to "drop-outs".31. Schools should promote policies and rules that are fair andjust; students should be represented in bodies formulating schoolpolicy, including policy on discipline, and decision-making.C. Community32. Community-based services and programmes which respond tothe special needs, problems, interests and concerns of young personsand which offer appropriate counselling and guidance to youngpersons and their families should be developed, or strengthenedwhere they exist.33. Communities should provide, or strengthen where they exist, awide range of community-based support measures for youngpersons, including community development centres, recreational facilitiesand services to respond to the special problems of children whoare at social risk. In providing these helping measures, respectfor individual rights should be ensured.34. Special facilities should be set up to provide adequateshelter for young persons who are no longer able to live at homeor who do not have homes to live in.35. A range of services and helping measures should be providedto deal with the difficulties experienced by young persons in thetransition to adulthood. Such services should include specialprogrammes for young drug abusers which emphasize care,counselling, assistance and therapy-oriented interventions.36. Voluntary organizations providing services for young personsshould be given financial and other support by Governments andother institutions.37. Youth organizations should be created or strengthened at thelocal level and given full participatory status in the managementof community affairs. These organizations should encourage youthto organize collective and voluntary projects, particularlyprojects aimed at helping young persons in need of assistance.38. Government agencies should take special responsibility andprovide necessary services for homeless or street children;information about local facilities, accommodation, employmentand other forms and sources of help should be made readily availableto young persons.39. A wide range of recreational facilities and services ofparticular interest to young persons should be established andmade easily accessible to them.D. Mass media40. The mass media should be encouraged to ensure that youngpersons have access to information and material from a diversityof national and international sources.41. The mass media should be encouraged to portray the positivecontribution of young persons to society.42. The mass media should be encouraged to disseminateinformation on the existence of services, facilities andopportunities for young persons in society.43. The mass media generally, and the television and film mediain particular, should be encouraged to minimize the level ofpornography, drugs and violence portrayed and to display violenceand exploitation disfavourably, as well as to avoid demeaning anddegrading presentations, especially of children, women andinterpersonal relations, and to promote egalitarian principlesand roles.44. The mass media should be aware of its extensive social roleand responsibility, as well as its influence, in communicationsrelating to youthful drug and alcohol abuse. It should use itspower for drug abuse prevention by relaying consistent messagesthrough a balanced approach. Effective drug awareness campaignsat all levels should be promoted.V. SOCIAL POLICY45. Government agencies should give high priority to plans andprogrammes for young persons and should provide sufficient fundsand other resources for the effective delivery of services,facilities and staff for adequate medical and mental health care,nutrition, housing and other relevant services, including drugand alcohol abuse prevention and treatment, ensuring that suchresources reach and actually benefit young persons.46. The institutionalization of young persons should be a measureof last resort and for the minimum necessary period, and the bestinterests of the young person should be of paramount importance.Criteria authorizing formal intervention of this type should bestrictly defined and limited to the following situations:(a) where the child or young person has suffered harm that hasbeen inflicted by the parents or guardians;(b) where the child or young person has been sexually, physicallyor emotionally abused by the parents or guardians;(c) where the child or young person has been neglected, abandonedor exploited by the parents or guardians;(d) where the child or young person is threatened by physical ormoral danger due to the behaviour of the parents or guardians; and(e) where a serious physical or psychological danger to thechild or young person has manifested itself in his or her ownbehaviour and neither the parents, the guardians, the juvenilehimself or herself nor non-residential community services canmeet the danger by means other than institutionalization.47. Government agencies should provide young persons with theopportunity of continuing in full-time education, funded by theState where parents or guardians are unable to support the youngpersons, and of receiving work experience.48. Programmes to prevent delinquency should be planned anddeveloped on the basis of reliable, scientific research findings,and periodically monitored, evaluated and adjusted accordingly.49. Scientific information should be disseminated to theprofessional community and to the public at large about the sortof behaviour or situation which indicates or may result inphysical and psychological victimization, harm and abuse, as wellas exploitation, of young persons.50. Generally, participation in plans and programmes should bevoluntary. Young persons themselves should be involved in theirformulation, development and implementation.51. Government should begin or continue to explore, develop andimplement policies, measures and strategies within and outsidethe criminal justice system to prevent domestic violence againstand affecting young persons and to ensure fair treatment to thesevictims of domestic violence.VI. LEGISLATION AND JUVENILE JUSTICEADMINISTRATION52. Governments should enact and enforce specific laws andprocedures to promote and protect the rights and well-being ofall young persons.53. Legislation preventing the victimization, abuse, exploitationand the use for criminal activities of children and young personsshould be enacted and enforced.54. No child or young person should be subjected to harsh ordegrading correction or punishment measures at home, in schoolsor in any other institutions.55. Legislation and enforcement aimed at restricting andcontrolling accessibility of weapons of any sort to children andyoung persons should be pursued.56. In order to prevent further stigmatization, victimization andcriminalization of young persons, legislation should be enactedto ensure that any conduct not considered an offence or notpenalized if committed by an adult is not considered an offenceand not penalized if committed by a young person.57. Consideration should be given to the establishment of anoffice of ombudsman or similar independent organ, which wouldensure that the status, rights and interests of young persons areupheld and that proper referral to available services is made.The ombudsman or other organ designated would also supervisethe implementation of the Riyadh Guidelines, the Beijing Rules andthe Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of theirLiberty. The ombudsman or other organ would, at regularintervals, publish a report on the progress made and on thedifficulties encountered in the implementation of the instrument.Child advocacy services should also be established.58. Law enforcement and other relevant personnel, of both sexes,should be trained to respond to the special needs of youngpersons and should be familiar with and use, to the maximumextent possible, programmes and referral possibilities for thediversion of young persons from the justice system.59. Legislation should be enacted and strictly enforced toprotect children and young persons from drug abuse and drugtraffickers.VII. RESEARCH, POLICY DEVELOPMENT ANDCO-ORDINATION60. Efforts should be made and appropriate mechanismsestablished to promote, on both a multidisciplinary and an intradisciplinarybasis, interaction and co-ordination between economic, social,education and health agencies and services, the justice system,youth, community and development agencies and other relevantinstitutions.61. The exchange of information, experience and expertise gainedthrough projects, programmes, practices and initiatives relatingto youth crime, delinquency prevention and juvenile justiceshould be intensified at the national, regional and internationallevels.62. Regional and international co-operation on matters of youthcrime, delinquency prevention and juvenile justice involvingpractitioners, experts and decision makers should be furtherdeveloped and strengthened.63. Technical and scientific co-operation on practical andpolicy-related matters, particularly in training, pilot anddemonstration projects, and on specific issues concerning theprevention of youth crime and juvenile delinquency should bestrongly supported by all Governments, the United Nations systemand other concerned organizations.64. Collaboration should be encouraged in undertaking scientificresearch with respect to effective modalities for youth crime andjuvenile delinquency prevention and the findings of such researchshould be widely disseminated and evaluated.65. Appropriate United Nations bodies, institutes, agencies andoffices should pursue close collaboration and co-ordination onvarious questions related to children juvenile justice and youthcrime and juvenile delinquency prevention.66. On the basis of the present Guidelines, the United NationsSecretariat, in co-operation with interested institutions, shouldplay an active role in the conduct of research, scientificcollaboration, the formulation of policy options and the reviewand monitoring of their implementation, and should serve as asource of reliable information on effective modalities fordelinquency prevention.1BG (not his actual initials), age eighteen.To preserve the anonymity of the children the initials used to identify a child bear no relation to the actual initials or name of the child.2EM, age fifteen.3The word "children" is used in this report to mean anyone under the age of eighteen. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as "every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier" (Article 1).4Annie E.

Jan. 1, 1992.6Because Human Rights Watch visited only two detention centers for children, the Rivarde Memorial Home in Jefferson Parish and the Youth Study Center in Orleans Parish, this report does not attempt to evaluate conditions in all detention centers in the state.Although the conditions at the detention facilities are not included, Human Rights Watch extends its thanks to Superintendent Richard Winder of the Youth Study Center, Dr. Walter Maestri, Director ofJuvenile Services in Jefferson Parish and his staff and Mr. Ernest Thomas, Detention Home Supervisor at Rivarde Memorial Home; all of whom were helpful to us.7Now known as the Jetson Correctional Center for Youth (JCCY).8G.A.

Res. 43/173, December 9, 1988.14As a result of the emphasis on naturalization and treatment in the standards applicable to children, many of the requirements are more detailed than the standards applicable to adults.For example, the specifications for the physical environment of adult facilities deal primarily with the tangible material environment like the size of the cell, the bed, the shower and the toilet.The standards for children's facilities call for facilities small enough to enable individualized treatment and of a design in keeping with the rehabilitative aims.There are virtually no programming requirements for adult facilities.Institutions housing children are required to provide education, vocational training and work opportunities, as well as recreational and physical training. Solitary confinement is prohibited for children, though not for adults.15Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979).16References to U.S. Constitutional Law will draw on a paper by Sue Burrell, Staff Attorney at the Youth Law Center in San Francisco, entitled, Legal Issues Relating to Conditions of Confinement for Detained Children, presented at the NJDA 6th Annual National Juvenile Services Training Institute, 1994.See also Soler et al., Representing the Child Client, (Matthew Bender Publishing, 1994).17Pena v.

Human Rights Watch considers the ACA standards to be the most comprehensive; they are, therefore, the only standards referred to in the report.2642 USC 1997.2720 USC 1401.28Interview with Mark Soler, President, Youth Law Center, September 8, 1995.29Children serving a juvenile life sentence in Louisiana may continue to be held in juvenile facilities between the ages of eighteen and twenty.30Since our visit this facility has changed its name to the Jetson Correctional Center for Youth.For purposes of this report, the name of the facility at the time of Human Rights Watch's investigation will be retained.31Interview with Mrs. Perla Steele, Director of Diagnostic Services, who administers the operations of JRDC, on March 16, 1995.32Interview with Secretary Richard Stalder of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, on May 4, 1995.33This information was provided to Human Rights Watch in a letter dated August 25, 1995, from George White, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Youth Development, Department of Public Safety and Corrections.34Human Rights Watch was not able to obtain this statistical information from TCCY.35Hayes Williams, et al v.

Large numbers of children, especially black children, are suspended from school each year, sometimes for the whole year. Louisiana also has one of the highest rates of incarceration among U.S. states.4 Approximately 1,500 children are confined in secure correctional facilities each year. The circumstances which lead to their incarceration are not within the scope of this report, nor are due process problems, such as adequate representation of the children. Human Rights Watch confined its investigation to the conditions in which children are confined in the Louisiana institutions.Region / CountryUnited States US Poverty and Economic Inequality Racial DiscriminationProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet Updates On Rights Issues From Around The GlobeSign UpConnect With UsTwitterFacebookYouTubeInstagramFooter menuContact UsCorrectionsPrivacy PolicyPermissionsBlackbaud Security IncidentSite MapChild Safeguarding© 2022 Human Rights WatchHuman Rights Watch | 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor | New York, NY 10118-3299 USA | t 1.212.290.4700Human Rights Watchis a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808Human Rights Watch
