They don’tlove us.—Kenji M., 17, living in an institution, Tokyo, August2012If Japan’s alternative care system doesn’tchange after this, I don’t believe it will change for many years to come.—Former child guidance center staff member, in chargeof foster parent system at the time of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, Miyagi,May 2012The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated muchof the coastal area of Tohoku in northeastern Japan, killed almost 16,000people and left 241 children orphaned. Almost all of the children weresubsequently taken in by relatives, and received generous financial supportfrom governmental and nongovernmental sources—a response that has giventhem, though indelibly marked by tragedy, a chance to rebuild their lives.But thousands of other Japanese children who are eitherorphaned or are facing serious difficulties with their families remain out ofthe limelight, receiving far less attention and support from the Japanesegovernment. In 2013, 39,047 children were living in alternative care becausethe state determined that their parents were either unable or unwilling to carefor them properly.[1]Click to expand ImageA child plays inside an evacuation center in Kamaishi inIwate prefecture, March 2011. © 2011 Athit Perawongmetha/Getty ImagesThe vast majority—over 85 percent—are placed ingovernment-run institutions, which in 2013 housed just under 34,000 children.[2]The rest receive care from foster parents or are placed in smaller “familyhomes,” where five to six foster children are cared for in one family. Arelatively tiny number, 303 in 2011,[3]are eventually formally adopted. For most, institutional living lastsapproximately five years. Such high rates of institutionalization contrastsharply with rates in countries with similar levels of development and economy.[4]Click to expand ImageSleeping quarters for children at a child care institution inthe Kansai region. Even teenagers have to share a room with others, without anyprivate space for themselves, June 2012.© 2012 Sayo Saruta/Human Rights Watch.This report examines Japan’s alternative care systemfor children—a structure that includes infant care institutions, childcare institutions, short-term therapeutic institutions, group homes forindependent living, and foster care and family homes. It analyzes thesystem’s organization and processes, and highlights the problems found inthe institutionalization of most children (including infants), as well as abusesthat take place in the system. It also considers the difficultpost-institutional environment that many children experience once they haveleft alternative care and the many continuing problems in the foster caresystem. Finally, it examines the experience of orphans of the 2011 earthquakeand tsunami.Human Rights Watch finds that while there have beenimprovements in alternative care made in the aftermath of a spate ofhigh-profile abuse cases in recent years, as well as a move to more fosteringand other positive policy initiatives, an array of practical problems andspecific abuses still plague the system.These problems include physical and sexual abuse by bothcaregivers and children; poor physical conditions; overly large institutions inwhich physical space is limited and chances for bonding and learning lifeskills are limited; and insufficient mechanisms for children to reportproblems. Lack of support for children once they leave the alternative caresystem leaves them prone to homelessness, low-paying work, little opportunityfor higher education, and difficulty navigating a social and employmentstructure in which a “guarantor” is crucial.More broadly, the very system of institutional care mayitself be abusive—depriving children of the smaller, family-based carethat studies have shown is important for their development and wellbeing.At the root of many of these problems is a long-standingpredisposition of Japan’s child guidance centers—which determinethe placement of children needing such care—towards institutionalizingchildren rather than placing them in adoption or foster care. A number ofreasons explored below inform this view, which includes deferring to the financialinterest of existing institutions as well as deferring to the preference ofbiological parents to place the child in an institution rather than with a fosterfamily. As one care worker at an institution inTsukuba said, “In Japan, the interest of the parents is seen as moreimportant than the interests of the child.”International human rights standards provide thatinstitutionalizing children who need alternative care should be a last resort,only used after care by members of the extended family, or opportunities foradoption or foster care are deemed unsuitable and not in the child’s bestinterests.***Over-institutionalization is a problem for all children whoneed alternative care, but it is especially problematic for infants—around 3,000 of who lived in infant institutions in 2013. Internationalstandards set out that alternative care for young children under three shouldbe, almost without exception, in family-based settings, and many childdevelopment specialists suggest that infants are at risk for attachmentdisorder, developmental delay, and neural atrophy when in institutional care.One care worker in a Tokyo institution told Human Rights Watch that the infantshoused there have no one to hold them when they cry at night because there aretoo few staff.A high proportion of children living in institutions havesome form of disability, mostly mild intellectual or emotional disabilities. Accordingto the government, about a quarter of all children living in child care institutionshave a disability.Some children with disabilities in child care institutionsare sent to specially designated schools reserved only for those with disabilities,and lose their opportunity to study in their community. Some children inalternative care are even more segregated from their peers and community, placedin so-called short-term therapeutic institutions that cater only to childrenwith disabilities, and are restricted from going out, even for school. Internationalhuman rights law and standards provide that children with disabilities have aright to be supported as necessary so that they can live in a community-basedsetting and have an inclusive education.The confining nature and duration of “temporary childcustody,” in which children who have been removed from their families arefirst placed, is also problematic. Children are confined to these lockedpremises, and often restricted from going to school or having contact with theoutside world. The law allows children to be held in such a facility for up totwo months, although this can be extendedindefinitely. In 2011, these children spent 28 days on national averagein such custody. In the worst cases, they were there for about two years.Many child care institutes in Japan are modern, clean, andsafe, but a few that Human Rights Watch visited were in poor condition. In one,the boys’ wing stank of urine, electrical wiring was exposed, wallpaperwas peeling, and much of the furniture was broken.But more than the physical conditions, the very nature oflife in these institutions is troubling. In particular, children lackprivacy—new standards in 2011 raised the living space requirement perchild in institutions to just 4.95 square meters—and opportunities todevelop a bond or trusting relationship with an adult care giver. Care workersrotate in and out, and are often too overworked to provide consistent care toindividual children.The large size of many facilities compounds the problem:more than 50 percent of child care institutions have facilities that can house20 or more children, and 30 facilities house over 100 children. Life in aninstitution does not seem conducive to learning important life skills, whetherforging human relationships, developing communication and social skills, orgaining daily coping skills that children in regular families would naturallylearn, such as how to cook a meal or eat in a restaurant.Lack of privacy, frustration, distress, and trauma from pastfamily abuse can also lead to violence and bullying among children insideinstitutions. And the sense of stigma and shame that segregation ininstitutions can breed can also prompt bullying and violence in schools againstchildren from institutions.Japan’s foster care system also has problems.Information collected by the government’s child abuse reporting systemfor children in alternative care shows that the percentage of abuses by fosterparents is higher than abuses recorded among children in an institutionalenvironment. There are a few cases in recent years in which children died infoster parent care.Moreover, almost a quarter of foster child placements do notwork out and the child is sent back to the institution. An inappropriatecertification and matching process also causes problems. Foster parents are notprovided with enough training, support, and monitoring. The child guidance center,which is positioned to deliver these inputs and training, does not have sufficienthuman resources and expertise to deliver. Authorities also fail to raiseawareness about the role of foster parents. As a result, foster parentcandidates who do register are often insufficiently qualified, whichparticularly affects placing children with diverse needs, includingdisabilities.Poor post-institutionalization outcomes for manychildren who grow up in institutions reflect the failure of such facilities andthe government to adequately prepare them for independent life once they leaveschool or turn 18. Just 73 percent of children living in the alternative caresystem complete high school in Tokyo, and just 15 percent of children inalternative care complete a higher education (a course of study in auniversity, college, or vocational school). National high school completionrates stand at 81.5 percent, and higher education graduation rates are 36.1percent in Japan.[5] Fartoo many children leave their institutions only to end up in low-paying jobs,or jobless, and even homeless.At the national level, the Japanese government hasrecognized the need to increase the use of foster parenting. But its plan fortransforming the alternative care system is piecemeal and half-hearted.In 2011, it set a goal to change the distribution ofalternative care in the next 10-plus years to be equally divided three waysamong the main larger institutions, house-based institutional care, and fosterparents. This would still officially allow two-thirds of the children to remaininstitutionalized, whether in larger or house-based institutions.[6] In line with this policy,significant budgetary resources have been dedicated to reform and remodel manylarge-sized institutions into units and house-based institutional care.Smaller institutions are recognized as better for childrenthan larger ones, but they cannot be the same as family-based care. They mayeven lead to greater government dependence on this slightly improved form ofinstitutional care, hindering transition to a full-fledged foster parent systemthat should not be put on hold to maintain existing institutional facilities.And while existing institutions understandably have a vested interest inmaintaining their current funding and work, the government—consistentwith its international legal obligations—should prioritize the bestinterests of the child, and treat the institutional transition towards asmaller-scale care system as provisional.Japan should demonstrate its commitment to increasing use ofadoption and foster parenting—and simultaneously decreasinginstitutionalization—by ensuring that its foster parenting system is ofsufficient quality to protect children in need of care. Deaths of foster children have received high-profile attention, but stepsstill need to be taken to prevent future tragedies. Unless the current fosterparent system is reformed and improved, simply increasing the number ofplacements could risk exposing children to more dislocation and anguish. Fosterparents need better training, better support, and better monitoring in order todeliver quality care to children. Measures to promote and improve adoptionshould also be seriously considered.The shortcomings of the existing systems can be overcome.But the situation will not change significantly so long as the currentavailability of institutional care facilities and difficulties in reforming adoptionand foster care are used as excuses to defend the status quo.Just like the orphans created by the earthquake and thetsunami, every child in need of alternative care in Japan has the right tofamily life. If that cannot be with their biological parents, alternativesolutions should be found for them with close relatives, or adoptive or fosterfamilies.The care and support shown to the child survivors of theearthquake and tsunami demonstrate that the Japanese government, along withcivil society, is more than capable of protecting its most vulnerable members.It is time that all children needing alternative care receive similar attentionand support.Key RecommendationsTo the Japanese DietRevise the Child Welfare Act sothat an independent mechanism, such as a family court, can decide where achild should be cared for in the alternative care settings to ensure theirbest interests are met, in line with the UN Guidelines for the AlternativeCare of Children.To the Japanese GovernmentClose all infant careinstitutions as part of a clear plan to transition the care of infantsfrom institutions to families. Ensure that the plan is time-bound and hasadequate resources and political support to reach its goals. Provide childrenunder the age of 3 years with care in family-based settings.Amend the Foster ParentsPlacement Guidelines in line with the UN Guidelines for the AlternativeCare of Children, which require that institutional care is limited to“cases where such a setting is specifically appropriate, necessaryand constructive for the individual child concerned and in his/her bestinterests,” and direct prefecture governments, ordinance designatedcities, and child guidance centers to implement the revised guidelines.The amendment should also specifya certain short period, such as 6 months for a child and 3 months for aninfant, as the maximum period a child can remain in an institution beforebeing cared in family-based settings, unless this is against the bestinterest of the child. This setting should be temporary only until theinstitutions, such as infant homes, are terminated.Direct the use of Child WelfareAct article 28 court process to place children with foster parents if any biologicalparents found to be abusive refuse to give consent to placing children infamily-based care.Assign an independent panel ofexperts to develop a set of policy recommendations to ensure that adoptionis considered before any other long-term arrangements, such as foster orinstitutional care;Utilize special adoption fornewborns by consulting with pregnant women who are not willing or able toraise their babies.Make sure that all fosterparents, including kinship-based foster parents and adoptive fosterparents, receive adequate training, monitoring, and support, includingfoster parent allowance. In order to come up with the improvedcomprehensive programs, assign an independent panel of experts to makerecommendations regarding the comprehensive training programs, supportprograms, and monitoring mechanisms for foster parents. It should alsorecommend concrete measures to improve the child guidance center’sability to support foster parents.MethodologyResearch for this report was conducted in Japan by aconsultant for Human Rights Watch and two Human Rights Watch staff members betweenDecember 2011 and February 2014. Human Rights Watch interviewed 202 people. Theinterviewees included 32 children ages 7 to 17 who are in alternative care, and27 adults who previously had lived in alternative care arrangements. Pseudonymsare used for all children and some adults quoted.We also interviewed foster parents, institutionadministrators, care workers, prefecture and national level governmentofficials (including staff members of 10 child guidance centers), academicsspecializing in child care issues, and experts from local nongovernmentalorganizations.Human Rights Watch visited 24 institutions in thealternative care system, including 18 child care institutions, four infant careinstitutions, one group home for independent living, and one short-termtherapeutic institution. Human Rights Watch also visited seven foster familyhomes and foster care homes.Human Rights Watch also attended several conferences andworkshops, including discussion events of children’s self-help groups,Zenkoku-Jidou-Yougo-Mondai-kenkyukai (National Workshop for Alternative Care),the Foster Parent Convention in Kanto, Koshinetsu and Shizuoka, as well asmeetings of foster parent organizations.Interviews and field investigations took place in four differentregions, and encompassed 10 prefectures out of total 47 prefectures in Japan,to ensure a comprehensive examination of local government policies that varybetween prefectures. The regions visited were Tohoku (Iwate and Miyagiprefectures), Kanto (Ibaragi, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures),Kansai (Osaka and Hyogo prefectures), and Kyusyu (Oita prefecture).In Tohoku, in addition to the general situation of thealternative care, Human Rights Watch conducted research on children who losttheir parents in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Kanto and Kansai were chosen sincethey have the largest population of children in alternative care in Japan andtheir systems have significant differences, seen by the continued operation of manylarge alternative child care institutions in Kansai. Human Rights Watch alsoconducted work in Oita because in recent years it had considerably increasedfoster parents placements.Out of the 202 interviewees, 61 are from the Tohoku region.Human Rights Watch visited Tohoku four times, in December 2011, and in May,June, and August of 2012. We visited cities and towns devastated by the 2011earthquake and interviewed earthquake orphans, care givers taking care of theorphans, local government officials, and representatives of civil societyorganizations.To gain additional perspectives on child care institutions,a Human Rights Watch researcher conducted daytime activities with children andstayed overnight in a child care institution in Chiba. The researcher alsojoined a three-day camping trip for high school children from alternative care.In this report, the word “child” refers toanyone under the age of 18. The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines achild as “every human being below the age of eighteen years unless underthe law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.”The Japanese Child Welfare Law also defines child as anyoneunder the age of 18, but full age is 20 in Japan according to civil law.Human Rights Watch ensured that all interviewees wereinformed in advance of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, andthe ways in which the data would be collected and used. Human Rights Watchobtained oral consent to conduct the interview from each interviewee. Wheneverpossible, which was in most cases, the interviews were held in private, butseveral were conducted in the presence of other people such as friends of theinterviewees; interviewees consented to this arrangement.Interviews were conducted in Japanese or in English andJapanese with the assistance of an interpreter. No one interviewed received anyfinancial compensation.In preparing this report, Human Rights Watch reviewedJapanese government documents and laws regarding alternative care and consultedreports written by United Nations and local and national nongovernmentalorganizations about alternative child care.I. Japan’s Alternative Care SystemIn 2013, 39,047 children lived in alternative care in Japan.[7]After World War II, child care institutions were mainlyintended to care for war orphans and street children. Today, however, mostchildren requiring alternative care are not orphans, but children who cannot livewith their families because of parental abuse or neglect.[8]The number of reported child abuse cases has been consistentlyrising since the late 1990s, when the issue was first recognized as a serioussocial problem.[9] Inaddition, children may live within the alternative care system if there is noparent to take care of them because they are deceased or incarcerated, or iftheir sole remaining parent has a disability so severe they cannot parent.Children who are victims ofdomestic abuse or neglect account for 53 percent of the children and youth inchild care institutions, 32 percent of those in foster family homes, and 32percent of infants in alternative care institutions, according to a 2008government report.[10]These figures may not include those who were placedin alternative care for a different reason but were also victims of abuse orneglect, or whose experience of abuse or neglect did not come to light untilafter they were already separated from their parent or guardian.Some institution staff saidthat up to 90 percent of children in care may have been victims of abuse orneglect.[11]According to theMinistry of Health, Labor and Welfare,the types of abuse experienced include neglect (70 percent), physical abuse (39percent), psychological abuse (24 percent), and sexual abuse (4 percent).[12]The child guidance center isthe government body with principal responsibility for children in need ofalternative care. There are 206 centers around the country, each reporting tothe prefectural or ordinance-designated city government where they are located.[13]Once informed by a school,medical facility, the police, or a member of the public of the potential needof a child for protection, staff members from these centers carry outinvestigations, ensure the safety of the child, and plan their support.[14]Temporary Child CustodyWhen a child guidancecenter finds there is an urgent need for protection, thecenter’s director makes the decision to remove the child from theirparents and place them in temporary custody. In Japan, this does not involveany judicial process.[15]These children are oftenplaced in a facility for temporary custody within a child guidance center,where they are confined and often restricted from going to school or havingcontact with the outside world.[16]Infants are temporarily placed in infant careinstitutions. Under the Child Welfare Act, a child may be held for up to twomonths in such a facility, although the child guidance center may authorizethat this period be extended for an unlimited time.On an average day in 2011, 1,541 children wereheld in temporary custody around the country, where they remained an average of28 days. In Chiba prefecture, which tops the statistics, children were intemporary custody for 53 days.[17]In some especially lengthy cases, the child was intemporary custody for nearly two years.[18]In 2011, 36 percent of municipalities had temporarycustody facilities that were over capacity.[19]While the child is intemporary custody, the child guidance center attempts to sort out the issuesbetween the parents and the child to allow the child to return to parentalcare. However, few special programsexist to assist parents with problemssuch as parental abuse that underlie many cases or drug addiction.[20]If a child in temporary custody is deemed to need longer separation from the parents, the child guidancecenter places them in a child care institution or in foster parent care,detailed below.[21]Longer Term CareThe Japanesegovernment’s alternative care system comprises of:Infant care institutions for newborns and infants;[22]Child care institutionsfor children (except infants) until theygraduate from high school, or are 15 or older and leave the educationsystem;[23]Group homes forindependent living for 15to 19 year olds who have left the education system and have been releasedfrom an alternative care institution or other care facilities, and forpersons in that age group who the prefecture governor determines needscontinued support.Short-term therapeutic institutions for children whoexperience difficulties in daily life because of psychological issues andpain and who need psychological treatment;[24]Foster parent system, whichprovides family care for one to four children in family home; andFoster family group homesystem, which providesfamily-based care for five to six childrenin a residential setting.Number of Children inAlternative Care, October 1, 2013[25]Child careinstitutions28,831Infantcare institutions3,069Short-termtherapeutic institutions1,310Fosterchildren in foster parents4,578Fosterchildren in foster family group home829Youths (age15-19) in group homes for independent living430Total:39,047Typically, child placement inalternative care takes place only after the child’s parent or guardianagrees.[26]The child guidance center plays an important role intrying to reach such an agreement with the child’s parent or guardian,but when this fails, the director of the center or each prefecture may apply to a family court for approval to place the child in aninstitution or foster parent’s care under article 28 of the Child WelfareAct by demonstrating that the child’swelfare is seriously violated in the custody of the parents. For those children recognized by the family court toneed institutional or foster parent care, a renewal procedure is required everytwo years.[27]Child Care InstitutionsMost children in the Japanesealternative care system are housed in institutions; only 14.8 percent ofchildren receiving alternative care do so from foster parents. Children sent toan institution spend an average of five years there, but as many as 18 percentstay longer than 10 years.[28]Child care institutions inJapan are large establishments, with an average institutional capacity of 55children. The largest institution can hold 164 children.[29]Japanese governmentclassifies institutions into three categories; large institutions with 20children or more (280 locations), middle-sized institutions with 13 to19 children (147 locations), and smaller facilities with 12 or less children(226 locations).[30]However, classifying some ofthese institutions as “middle-sized” and “small-sized”does not mean they are small. Rather such institutions could have multipleunits under their purview, and the total number of children in the so-calledsmall and middle-sized institutions can be quite large—in fact, similar in size to the so-called“large-sized” institutions that could have more than 100 children.[31]In “large”institutions, children live in a dormitory-type residence sharing rooms,bathrooms, dining rooms, and living rooms with dozens of other children.  51percent of child care institutions in Japan have one or more“large” residences.Efforts to provide care insmaller groups within institutions through house-based or other unit-based carefacilities are intended to transform the large-scale institutions intosmall-scale systems to provide better services and downsize the livingenvironment for children. The unit-based care system in institutions divides the institution into smallergroups of six to eight children that are independent and clearly divided fromeach other. The house-based institutional care is operated by a larger institution but accommodates up to six childrenunder the care of around three staff in a separate rented localresidence.Infant care institutions andshort-term therapeutic institutions will be discussed in section II.Foster CareIn 2012, 4,295foster children lived in 3,292 households in Japan and 671 children lived in177 foster family group homes. Japan’s foster care system is made up offour types of foster parent arrangements and one foster family group homearrangement:Foster Care ArrangementsRegistered foster parents: This is the most basictype of foster parent arrangement in Japan. Registered foster parents mustrenew their status every five years by completing a one-day training sessionconducted by prefectural or city-level officials, or by nonprofit organizationsthat are entrusted to conduct the trainings. They receive the foster parentallowance of 72,000 yen (US$720) per month paid by the prefectural or citygovernment and the national government, plus general living, educational, andmedical expenses.[32]There were 7,001 households of registered foster parents in 2012, yet slightlymore than one-third (2,617) were matched with a child, providing care for thetotal of 3,283 children.Specialized (registered) foster parents: If the childguidance center determines that a child needs special care, they are placedwith specialized foster parents. These children may include those who havefaced traumatic experiences, such as abuse that has affected them mentally andphysically; children who have come into conflict with the law; or children withphysical or mental disabilities. Specialized foster parents have more thanthree years of experience as a registered foster parent or institutional carestaff, have completed government organized training for specialized fosterparents, and should be capable of dedicating adequate time and resource tocaring for the child. Their registration as a specialized foster parent needsto be updated every two years followed by a training session. They receive thespecialized foster parent allowance of 123,000 yen ($1,230) per month andgeneral living, educational, and medical expenses. In 2012, there were 602households registered as specialized foster parents, but only 152 had beenmatched with at least one child as specialized foster parents, covering 184children.[33]Adoptive (registered) foster parents: These arefoster parents who ultimately wish to adopt a child. In 2012, there were 179children placed in 183 such households out of a total of 2,124 households thatwere registered as adoptive foster parents.[34]This is often used for building stronger ties between children who are unlikelyto be able to be reunited with their biological family, and foster parents whoare unable to have a biological child. Slightly more than 17 percent of fosterparents eventually adopt their foster children in Japan, and others remain asfoster parents.[35]However, due to financial reasons, many foster parents who might actually wishto adopt the child they are caring for, register as foster parents not asadoptive foster parents. Japanese government policy dictates that if theyregister themselves as adoptive foster parents, they lose the foster parentallowance of 72,000 yen ($720) per month paid by the prefectural or citygovernment, and the national government. They only receive general living,educational, and medical expenses.Kinship-based (registered) foster parents: In thistype of arrangement, relatives within the third degree of consanguinity take inthe child and become the responsible relative for providing care for the child.Kinship-based foster parents are not entitled to receive a registered fosterparent allowance, but receive general living expense, educational expense, andmedical expense coverage. Within the third degree of consanguinity, there is anexception for uncles and aunts who under Japanese civil law are not consideredto be obligated to take care of children, and therefore are placed in thecategory of registered foster parents who are eligible for the foster parentallowance. This exception was created in 2011 after many uncles and auntsstarted taking care of their nephews and nieces because of the 2011 earthquake.In 2012, there were 649 children placed in 434 households out of 445 registeredhouseholds in this category.[36]Foster family group home: Established in 2009, thissystem is designed to enlarge the scale of the foster parent system by providing family-based care for a group of five or sixchildren in a residential setting.[37]In all, there were 8,726 households registered under thefoster parent system in 2012, but as many as 60 percent of the registeredfoster parents were not matched up with a child. This issue will be discussedlater in “Inappropriate Certification and Matching,” section III.Steps to Foster ParentCertification, Registration, and Child PlacementThe foster parent system is run and managed by the child guidancecenter established in each prefecture and ordinance-designated city. Once apotential foster parent submits an application to the child guidance center,the candidate receives basic pre-certification training, residence visits, andinspection.The inspection results are forwarded to the prefecturalgovernor or ordinance-designated city mayor for assessment by the Child WelfareAdvisory Council as to the candidate’s suitability as a foster parent.To become a certified foster parent, candidates must meet therequirements outlined in the Ordinance for Enforcement of Child Welfare Act,including devotion to childrearing, adequate financial status, and completionof training for registered foster parents.[38]These national certification requirements for foster parents are supplementedin some cases by additional requirements from the prefecture or city, and sothere are some variations.[39]When there is a potential foster child to be placed in care,the child guidance center arranges a match-up process, which involves a seriesof visits by the potential foster parents to the facility for temporary custodyor institution where the child is placed, as well as trial placements of thechild with the potential foster parents in their residence before the placementis made official.[40]Financial Support for Foster ParentsThe government gives foster parents money to cover thegeneral living costs of a child. As of 2013, this was 54,980 yen ($550) permonth for infants, and 47,680 yen ($480) per month for others. Foster parentsalso receive additional funds for educational expenses, preparation for a jobor higher education, and medical services. In addition, a monthly allowance of72,000 yen ($720) is granted to registered foster parents for the first childthey care for, and 36,000 yen ($360) for each subsequent foster child.Specialized foster parents receive more: 123,000 yen($1,230) per month and 87,000 yen ($870) for each child after the first.[41]However, kinship-based foster parents and adoptive foster parents receive nomonthly allowance.[42]Post-Placement SupportAfter a child is placed with foster parents, the child guidancecenter staff or similarly positioned personnel (e.g. foster parent assistancecounselors in child care institutions) visit the household to inspect thesituation, and give guidance and support.[43]Foster parents are encouraged to get support from fosterparent groups, which host gatherings, and provide training and consultationservices. Some services, such as trainings, are subsidized by prefecturalgovernments and entrusted to foster parent groups and other nonprofitorganizations that act as foster parent support agencies. Starting from 2012,foster parent assistance counselors have also been deployed in child careinstitutions and infant care institutions to provide support and consultationfor foster parents. Problems regarding post-placement support are detailedlater in this report (see section III).AdoptionAdoption is generally deemed to better serve a child’sinterests than foster care or institutional care, should family reintegrationprove impossible within an appropriate period. However, child guidance centersare often reluctant to use adoption and consequently, in 2011, only 303children were adopted through the child guidance centers. The same year, 127additional children were adopted through registered private agencies.[44]The family court must grant permission for a child to beadopted. For the adoption of children up to age 15, a legal representative ofthe child, including biological parents, consents on their behalf.[45]Japan also has the system of special adoption that promotesa relationship similar to with biological parents, under which it terminatesthe relationship between the biological parents and the child. Special adoptionis allowed only for children under six years old and after the family courtdecision following more than six months’ probation period.[46]Some prefectures, such as Aichi, try to find special adoptive parents fornewborn babies after consultation with pregnant women who are either unwillingor unable to raise their babies, but this trend has not spread.II. Abuse and Problems in InstitutionsI was having a very difficult time in my life, and all thefriends I met at junior high school had parents, and I wanted to have parentsas well.—Masaki, 15, who lives in an institution, TohokuDecember 2011Recent efforts to end the traditional use of physicalpunishments against children living in institutions have led to a significantdecrease in incidents of physical abuse, although a small number are stillreported.[47] Butchildren living in institutions continue to face abuse, bullying, andharassment from their peers, both from within and outside their institution.Moreover, the conditions in some institutions may alsoqualify as abusive, as may the overuse of institutions. Extensive research bychild development experts has shown that institutionalization can cause severedevelopmental delays, disability, and irreversible psychological damage. Suchnegative effects are more severe the longer a child remains in an institution,or when the conditions of the institution are poor.Physical and Sexual Abuse byAdultsPhysical abuse, including hitting, kicking, and forcing childrento stand in place or sit in the Japanese traditional seiza style for along time [48]—oftenmeted out under the guise of discipline—used to be widespread in childcare institutions in Japan. A child care institution chief told Human RightsWatch that in the past they often frequently “raised a hand” to achild.[49]However, growing societal opposition to the use of physicalpunishment, combined with a series of cases from late 1990s to mid-2000s thatpublicly exposed abuses in certain institutions, eventually led to reform.In April 2009, the government finally revised the ChildWelfare Act and mandated that “institutional staff and similarlypositioned personnel must not conduct any actions which may cause harmfulimpacts on children in care, physically or mentally.”[50]New guidelines to prevent child abuse in alternative carewere also formulated, requiring that the number of child abuse cases ininstitutions and the foster parent’s care be reported to eachmunicipality, and published.[51]Many experts whom Human Rights Watch interviewed said the tendency ofalternative care providers to view physical punishments as customary hasreceded, and the gravity of child abuse by institutional staff hassignificantly diminished.[52]In 2011 (the most recent year for which information has beenpublished), 193 cases of abuse in alternative care were reported through thischild abuse reporting system.[53] Ofthose, government investigations found 46 credible claims, including 37 casesof physical abuse, 6 cases of psychological abuse, 2 cases of neglect, and 1case of sexual abuse. Of the 46 valid cases, roughly two-thirds were in childcare institutions, and 13 percent were foster care and foster family grouphomes.  The remaining 26 percent of cases included one in an infant home,four in group homes for independent living, three in child guidance centers(including temporary shelters); and four cases in institutions for childrenwith disabilities.Incidents included physical violence, such as slapping andkicking by care workers at institutions when reprimanding children.[54]For example, three workers at one child care institution hit a child in thehead, and used other violence after they found the child had hit his youngerbrother, saying, “He would not understand unless [he was] beinghit.” The workers told the child: “You should experience the painyourself.”  At another child care institution, a staff member hadsexual relations with a child.One child interviewed by Human Rights Watch recalled that astaff member always hit a child if it was perceived the child did somethingwrong. “Everyone saw it, but did not stop it or even say anything,”the interviewee said.[55]However, the nature of the subject of abuse is so sensitive thatsome victims are reluctant to report what has happened to them. In addition, manychildren do not know they can report their experience to outside organizations.As a result, there is a strong possibility that the actual number ofinstitutional abuse cases is higher than official figures suggest.[56]Harassment and Violence amongChildrenLack of privacy, frustration, overcrowding, and a failure toseparate particularly vulnerable children from older, more aggressive childrencan lead to violence and bullying. Many children told Human Rights Watch thatbullying or harassment by other children was the hardest part of living in aninstitution. One institution head told Human Rights Watch: “We are awarethat there is always a power dynamic between the older children and youngerones.”[57]Aki K., a junior high school student, was bullied by otherchildren at her institution in Tokyo. She told her care worker about theharassment, who asked the children to stop. However, the bullying continued.Aki said: “I wanted the head of the institution to ask the children tostop it with a forceful voice,” but he did not do anything and theabusive situation continued.[58] Akiwas taken into a storeroom and sexually abused by other children from herinstitution. Aki said, “I was troubled all the time when I was in theinstitution not being able to talk to anybody about the harassment. I wishedthey would have noticed it without me having to tell them.”[59]Aki’s foster mother told Human Rights Watch,“The institution was concerned of the risk of pregnancy should she stayany longer and she was sent to us right after they found out about theassaults.”[60]At another institution, the head told us that, on average,there was one incident of sexual abuse between children each year.[61]Joji S., a 15-year-old living in an institution in Osaka,told Human Rights Watch:I was very aggressive when I was in elementary school.Punching and damaging all sorts of things. I was fighting all the time in theinstitution. I even punched the other children for small things that didn’tmean anything…. In my previous institution I noticed that some spaces areblind spots for the care workers, and sometimes the children were beingthreatened or crying [there].[62]Toshiyuki Abe, 19, recalled that when he was in elementaryschool, he was brutally bullied by older children at his institution. He toldHuman Rights Watch: “I was beaten by a baseball bat, hit in the face.… The older guys would just hit me if they were having a badday.”  He added that the institution staff knew about the bullyingbut the staff person “was an old lady so she didn’t sayanything.”[63]Children also face stigma and exclusion at school due to thefact that they live in institutions. Hana T., 13, told Human Rights Watch,“At school, classmates know I come from the institution and they keepsome kind of distance.”[64]An institution head told Human Rights Watch that childrenfrom his institution struggle in school, “Because they’re living inan institution, because they are not living in families. It’s out of thetypical Japanese picture, so if you’re out of that they feel bad aboutit.”[65]Maiko, now 20 years old but still living in an institution, noted:There are children living in residential care institutionswho are hiding that fact, because of the ideas that some people have aboutpeople who live in residential care institutions.[66]Nozomi M. told Human Rights Watch:I feel unhappy about living in an institution because whenI go to school next door everyone knows where I came from. For example, lastyear, all of a sudden, my classmates started saying that I was supported by thetaxes that they pay. And this year … when they were talking about goingon some trip doing something fun, they said “Because you come from theinstitution you can’t make it because of the money and the time.”All of the time, they are saying, “Probably you can’t do it becauseyou come from the institution.”[67]Institutionalization of InfantsThe vast majority of infants(children under 2) who require alternative care in Japan end up ininstitutions—despite studies that indicate that children under 4risk developmental and psychological damage when they do not have adequateopportunities to bond with their parents or care giver.[68]Out of 2,032 children underthe age of 2 who required alternative care in 2011, merely 15 percent (310children) were placed into foster parent care and the remaining 85 percent (1,722children) were admitted to infant care institutions.[69] Almost half of all municipalities and governmentordinance-designated cities did not have a single case of foster parentplacement for infants under one year old in 2011.[70] In 2011, 2,963 children were living in infant careinstitutions. [71]Click to expand ImageBaby beds lined up side by side at an infant care institutionin Tokyo, where newborns and infants up to age two are placed in two bedroomswith a capacity of 35 children each, August 2012.© 2012 Sayo Saruta/Human Rights WatchFor example, in Tokyo, whichhas the most number of children in need of alternative care, 395 children younger than 2years old were brought into alternative care in 2010. Of these, 95 percent weresent to infant care institutions; and only 17 from the one-year-old age groupand 1 from the under one-year-old age group were placed into foster parent care.Institutionalizationdominated the response for infants, and in fact, not a single infant from among56 infants in the under one-month-old age group was placed into foster parentcare.[72]Sumiko Hennessy, an emeritusprofessor in Tokyo and an expert in child abuse and attachment disorder, said:Consistent bonds of attachment with parents are importantfor normal growth of the brain. Bonds of attachment made within the first threemonths after birth and made after that period differ in depth and quality.… We [in Japan] have been creating mentally delayed children by bringingthem into infant homes.[73]Katsumi Takenaka, a fosterparent who grew up in a child care institution, told Human Rights Watch:Japanese alternative care takes the trouble of puttingbabies into infant care institutions only to make them disabled, and then latermakes the point that they are in need of care precisely because of this. If[the children] had been given to foster parents in the first place, suchhardship would have been unnecessary.[74]At Saiseikai Chuo HospitalInfant Care Institution in Tokyo, the newborns and infants up to age two are placed intwo bedrooms with a capacity of 35 children each, which is then supplemented byone playroom and one dining room. The chief nurse of this facility, MatsueTakeuchi, said:This facility was established in response to the GreatKanto Earthquake [in 1923] and as much as we feel sorry for the children, thereis not much we can do [about the poor environment].[75]At the Futaba Infant CareInstitution in Tokyo, infants who cry at night have no one to hold them. A careworker noted:There are not enough care staff at night so one worker hasto take care of many children at once. When there are multiple children cryingat the same time, we can’t do anything but hold one child and feed therest of them from a bottle placed on their bedside.[76]Segregation of Children with DisabilitiesChildren with disabilities are over-represented inJapan’s alternative care system. According to the government,approximately a quarter of all children in child care institutions (which arenot specialized for children with disabilities) have a disability or medicalcondition.[77]This includes intellectual disabilities (40 percent), “pervasivedevelopmental disorders” (11 percent), attention deficit-hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) (11 percent), “physical weakness” (10 percent),speech disabilities (6 percent), epilepsy (5 percent), and learning disabilities(5 percent).[78]Fifty-three percent of children in child care institutionsare victims of abuse who have a number of emotional and behavioral issues,which increases the number of children needing specialized attention.[79]Abuse could be a cause of physical issues and various developmental delays dueto the impact on brain development.[80]Notable characteristics shown in the behaviors of abusedchildren include a series of sudden and severe problematic behaviors;dissociation (loss of memory, an altered state of consciousness, hallucination,and switching personalities occurs daily along with frequent aggressivebehaviors); hyperactivity; irritability; and malfunction of emotional control,and aggressive behaviors.[81]However, rather than taking care of their existing problems,an immediate result of institutionalization of those abused children inalternative care is creating greater difficulties for these children, forexample, by causing them increased difficulties forming appropriate humanrelationships.[82]Furthermore, when children with a disability enter the alternativecare system, they are in some cases further segregated from their peers andcommunity. Nearly 1,300 children live in Japan’s 38 so-called short-termtherapeutic institutions that areintendedto treat children with emotional or behavioral issues.[83]According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, morethan 70 percent of the children living in these institutions were victims ofabuse in their homes.[84] Theseinstitutions have doctors, psychotherapists, and nurses who provide psychiatrictreatments and other support, such as life guidance and academic assistance. Mostchildren live in these institutions and in some cases attend classes within them,while a small number of children visit these institutions for nonresidentialcare.Children are supposed to be discharged once theirtherapeutic goals are achieved. The average period of stay for these childrenin these institutions nationally is 2.1 years.[85]Human Rights Watch visited one such institution in Yokohama with 50 childrenfrom elementary to high school age, and was informed by the institution’shead that “to make some kind of improvement it takes about threeyears.” He added, “Some stay from elementary school to 12thgrade.”[86]At this institution in Yokohama, all children of elementaryand middle school age attended small classes inside the institution, which thehead promoted as being “not that different from regular school.”[87]Children do not leave the building to walk from their rooms to their classroom.They are allowed outside into the institution’s playground to play, butmust apply for permission to go outside the institution.Furthering their isolation from peers and community, the institutionhad just two computers for the 50 children—despite Japan having one ofthe highest per capita number of computers in the world, with almost eightcomputers for every ten people.[88]Once they reach high school age, the vast majority ofchildren at the institution attend regular school, but struggle to fit in.According to the head:They feel bad about themselves; they know they are notnormal, so they keep a distance. They care very much about how others viewthem.[89]The head did not express an opinion as to whether the factthat they had been excluded from regular schools until high school might haveinfluenced the students’ feelings of unease and stigma.Thirty-eight of these so-called “short-term”therapeutic institutions have similar arrangements whereby children also attend“special” education institutions. In this separate education model,in which children with disabilities are taught in segregated schools, childrenwith and without disabilities have very little interaction. This can lead togreater marginalization within the community, a situation that persons withdisability face generally, thus entrenching discrimination.[90]Some children, although not segregated into“therapeutic institutions,” are nonetheless sent by theirinstitutions to segregated schools for children with disabilities. MasashiSuzuki (pseudonym), for example, was sent to a “special guidanceschool” instead of a regular high school where he said he did not makefriends because all his schoolmates had more severe disabilities. “I wentto drink with my teachers. My only friends were those I knew from junior highschool who were in a regular high school,” herecalled.[91]Maiko W., who was sent to an elementary school and juniorhigh school for children with disabilities, but then went to a mainstreamschool for high school remarked:When I went to high school, it was the first time that Iwas living in the community. I realized there is so much information that Ididn’t know. Certain values, certain ways of living, I just didn’tknow. If we were integrated into the community, the exchange of ideas would bemuch better.[92]See section V for international standards for inclusiveeducation for children with disabilities, and for community basednon-institutional residential care for these children.GeneralInstitutionalization-Related ProblemsAlternative care in Japan depends significantly oninstitutions. Compared to other developed countries, the rate of foster parentplacement, 13.5 percent in 2012, is extremely low.[93]The proportion of children who enter the alternative care system is lower thanin similarly developed countries.[94]Click to expand ImageOnce they enter an institution, a child will live in aninstitution for an average of five years. Fourteen percent of children stay inan institution for more than ten years.[95]As explained in greater detail in section V, international standards generallyrecommend favor family-based alternatives to institutional care.Click to expand ImageBeds for children in kindergarten at a child care institutionin the Kansai region. The beds are supplemented by a small playing space in thesame room, June 2012. © 2012 Sayo Saruta/Human Rights WatchA number of studies have linked institutional care ingeneral (discussed further later in this section) to adverse effects onchildren’s mental, physical, intellectual, and language development.[96] While many children are admitted to institutions dueto abuse and neglect in their own homes, the negative consequences ofinstitutional care can compound the damage done to the child. Kevin Browne, aprofessor of Forensic Psychology and Child Health at Nottingham University inthe United Kingdom, writes: “Even apparently ‘goodquality’ institutional care can have a detrimental effect onchildren’s ability to form relationships throughout life.”[97] Foster care allows for a deeper, more sustained, andmore consistent relationship with the child than is possible in institutionalcare. Megumi Fukuta, a former foster child, told Human Rights Watch:The biggest difference [in the foster parent’s carefrom institutions] is that you will always have the same adult [to look afteryou]. Even in house-based institutional care where resident care givers aresupposedly providing 24-hour care, these people don’t necessarily workthere forever.[98]Tomoya Maruyama, who caresfor four children in a foster family group home in Saitama prefecture, has seenfirst-hand the problems derived from institutional care, includingdevelopmental delays among the many children whom he has cared for over theyears. Based on his experience, he suggested that these delays could have beencaused by abuse in the home, coupled with inadequate institutional care.“The institution’s primary goal is ‘safety.’ Theycannot afford to strongly encourage children to try new things,” Maruyamasaid. “When a child faces difficulties in doing something, we asfoster parents consider all sorts of ways to make it possible and get the childto try over and over again with patience. That’s not possible ininstitutions.”[99]Maruyama, who helps hisfoster children with their homework every day, stated it is important to getfoster children to “study properly.” He explained that becausechildren in alternative care face difficulties when they are young, they oftenneed to work harder to keep up academically: “I feel I needed to get themto study harder than my own child.” Maruyama, who sends his fosterchildren to soccer class and other extracurricular activities, pointed outanother difference from institutional care saying:Children go to play soccer on weekends. Naturally, we asparents go with them. That’s nothing special. But in institutions, if onechild goes outside, the staff will be short the one worker who must accompanythat child. The result is children cannot even go out of the institution tolessons or practices to do what they like freely.[100]Overly LargeInstitutionsThe general problem of institutionalization can becompounded by the large size of many facilities: More than 50 percent of childcare institutions have facilities which can house 20 or more children. Ofthese, 30 facilities can house over 100 children. Five of these can hold over150 children.[101] Manyof these institutions hold as many children as their maximum capacity, or justa few less than the limit.Satoshi Hayakawa, who works at child care institution MeguroWakabaryo, explained that large-scale institutions are incapable of providingchildren with adequate, quality living conditions. “Putting children in alarge-scale institution for a long time is systematic abuse on its own,”he said. “Children’s life style in big institutions is so differentfrom the normal life in the society. They put children into the abnormalsituations and they cannot learn what they should learn.”[102]The Japanese government’s recent push towardsfamily-based care has in recent years begun to shift from a large-scale,institution-heavy care structure to a smaller-scale (but still institutional)care system that the government claims promotes family-like settings, such asunit-based care and house-based care within a larger institution.In 2011, the Japanese government set a goal to change theweight of alternative care distribution to be equally divided three ways amongthe main institutions (with a new limit of no more than 45 children),house-based institutional care, and foster parents (including foster familygroup homes) within the next 10-plus years.[103]In line with this policy orientation, many large-sized institutions have been,or are being, reformed and renovated to move towards unit-based care andhouse-based institutional care.[104]Some large institutions have adopted unit-based care andhouse-based institutional care. Care workers in such institutions told HumanRights Watch that “the children are much calmer now” and “theliving environment became much quieter, like a regular family home.”[105]Additionally, institution staff members argued that these new forms ofinstitutional care provide a living environment more similar to a regularfamily home and thus help children learn day-to-day coping skills such as howto use a refrigerator or what vegetables look like before being served on aplate, reducing a number of problems often associated with large-scaleinstitutional living.[106]But even with improvements, institutional care cannot be thesame as family-based care. While smaller institutions are considered better forchildren than larger ones, they typically will not be in the best interests ofthe child compared to family-based care. The fact that many facilities havebeen reconstructed or newly built to shift institutional care from large groupfacilities towards unit-based care or house-based institutional care may evenlead to a greater government dependence on this slightly improved form ofinstitutional care that hinders a transition to a full-fledged adoption and fosterparent system.Staff Shortages, Barriersto BondingAt institutions, care workers rotate in and out and canrarely provide consistent care to the children they oversee. As a result, manychildren grow up in environments where they are never able to develop a bond ortrusting relationship with an adult care giver.Setsuko Yamamoto spent 25years as a foster parent after working for seven years as a staff member at achild care institution. She currently cares for six foster children at a FosterFamily Group Home. Setsuko told Human Rights Watch:What’s important for children is to receive love froma specific individual and establish a safe, unshaken relationship with him orher since the time they are infants. You could face some problems along the waybut I find that having this “unshaken relationship” is absolutelyessential. Staying in long-term institutional care impairs the fundamentalstability of a person.[107]The goal of consistent careby the same individual is virtually impossible in institutional care. Even inthe institutions that designate a specific caregiver for a group of children,the staff operates on eight-hour shifts, so they may not always look after thesame group of children. There is also staff turnover, meaning that staffcaregivers change over time.Hiro S., a third-year highschool student in institutional care, said:When I see small children held by the care workers, Ireally envy them. Staff members do not have time to take care of older childrenlike me… It is so bad when the staff change and even quit. I hate thechange. I feel if you leave me eventually, I won’t trust you from thebeginning.[108]Kenji M., who is 17, toldHuman Rights Watch:I had the same care worker for me since I was 3 years olduntil I was 15 years old. But two years ago, the worker changed. The new workeris too young for me.… Many of the staff look like they take care of usonly because it is their job. They just play with us and they work. Theydon’t love us.[109]At one institution with 98children that Human Rights Watch visited in Osaka, one staff member statedproudly:We make it a rule for a care worker who is assigned to achild that once a month they have tea time, when they sit down and the careworker can ask if the child has anything of concern.[110]The number of staff deployed in institutions in Japan isstrikingly low compared to similar European and North American child careinstitutions.[111]This creates an inevitable problem in maintaining quality care. For example, inEngland, the standards are set to place at least one caregiver per child.Japan’s new 2012 standards provide that the child to care worker ratio is“1.6:1” for children aged zero to one year old,“2:1”for two year olds, “4:1” for young children from three to five, and“5.5:1” for those from school age (six years old) to eighteen yearsold.Japan’s new standards were a major disappointment forvarious stakeholders in the field of institutional care, many of whom werehoping for more significant changes.[112]Despitesome budget allocations for special staff deployment, such as individual carestaff and family support counselors, some institutions with unit-based careonly have one worker looking after 18 children at night, working on thethree-shift system. Human Rights Watch observed such staffing arrangements intwo institutions, and inadequate staffing levels to meet needs were a commoncomplaint among staff members from other institutions.Difficulties Learning LifeSkillsWhen Human Rights Watch askedindividuals who had spent time in institutions as a child what was most lackingin institutional care, the predominant answer was that basic social skillsrequired for life in society were not taught. Kiyomi Morikawa, a30-year-old woman living in Chiba who grew up in institutional care explained:The biggest problem I had after coming out of theinstitution was that I didn’t know basic things in life. I didn’tknow that you don’t get electricity at home if you don’t pay forit, how to buy tickets to ride a train, or how to order food atMcDonald’s. We go out in society without knowing these things, while achild from a normal family can simply learn from day-to-day life.[113]Tomo S., who is in the sixth grade andlives in a foster family, told Human Rights Watch that at first, after he movedfrom an institution, “I didn’t know what to do when I went shoppingwith my new foster family.”[114]A foster parent pointed outthat in institutions “normal things are so restricted that the childrenare unaware of the fact and that situation becomes the norm.” He saidthat “it is important that children learn from day-to-day life.”[115]These seemingly trivial things can build up to make itdifficult for individuals who have lived in an institution to becomeself-reliant. Many institution graduates told Human Rights Watch that there isa serious need for sufficient training on independent living skills, includingcommunication skills, social survival skills, and regular day-to-day copingskills.[116]Children living in institutions also have difficultieslearning family-based social behaviors, as well as experiencing a family modelof nurturing children that could influence the way they parent.[117] “I now know for the first time in my life what‘spending time with family’ meant after having started living withmy foster family,” a high school aged female foster child told HumanRights Watch.[118]Lack of PrivacyKunifusa Utagawa, the principal of child care institutionKoubo Aijien, described the difficulty providing child care as he showed HumanRights Watch the built-in, clinical looking bunk beds lined up in a room.[119]Another institution that Human Rights Watch visited was anannex of a local hospital, and the children’s rooms resembled a medicalward filled with hospital beds. The space on their own bed was the only placechildren were allowed some privacy.[120]In one institution, eight children shared each room.[121]Maiko W., who had lived at this institution for several years, told HumanRights Watch:There are certain times when I want to think over, or thinkthrough certain things and I want to do so in peaceful circumstances. But if Iam surrounded by people it doesn’t make me tense, as such, but you canalways feel people’s eyes on you. I just want to be alone sometimes.[122]Click to expand ImageSleeping quarters for boys at a child care institution inIwate prefecture. Children’s’ rooms often resemble medical wardsfilled with hospital beds, August 2012. © 2012 Sayo Saruta/Human RightsWatchAki K., a junior high student, who now lives in afoster family, told Human Rights Watch that when she lived in an institution,“I shared a room with three children. It is same even for high schoolstudents. There is no private space for myself.”[123]The minimum standards that Japanese child care institutions andinfant care institutions must meet are defined in the “Facility andOperational Standards for Child Care Institutions.”[124]In 2011, the living space requirement per child in child care institutions wasraised from only 3.3 square meters per child to 4.95 square meters per child,and infant institutions from only 1.65 square meters to 2.47 square meters perchild.[125]Poor Hygiene and SafetyTwo facilities Human Rights Watch visited had readilyapparent problems with sub-standard hygiene and safety.At one facility, the boys wing smelled strongly of urine,paint and wallpaper were peeling, numerous wall sockets were smashed, carpetswere stained, many pieces of furniture were broken, the fabric on seats wasripped, and there were holes in the wall.[126]The condition was particularly concerning because it waspossible that maintenance had not been prioritized as the institution wasbuilding a new facility that would comply with the government’s desirefor “smaller” institutions.At another institution, where five to six children share aroom, books, cups, towels, and clothes that belonged to different children werescattered all over their rooms, heavy dust lay on window frames, and dirty matswere piled in the corridor.However, the results of the most recent assessment by athird party did not appear to recognize, or even remotely match, the problemsthat Human Rights Watch saw. For example, the latter facility was given an“A” in an evaluation carried out in 2013 that had rated theinstitution in terms of whether “overall facility including bedrooms isclean.” The same institution received a “B” rating for how it“provides space for each child where children can feel secure and comfort.”[127]Lack of Reporting MechanismsThe national government has taken some steps to givechildren the ability to expose institutional problems and abuses. According togovernment standards, each institution has to take necessary measures to treatopinions and complaints from children appropriately.[128]Many institutions have set up an “opinion box” to allow children tosend their views directly to the institution staffs. There is also a Children’sRights Guidebookthat the national government strongly recommendsprefecture governments develop and issue to the child guidance centers undertheir purview, although not all prefectures do so.In addition, the government requires that each institutionreceive a third-party assessment every three years and involve a third-party totreat childrens’ complaints.[129]The Children’s Rights Guidebook teacheschildren they have rights, and provides contact information for them to seekhelp if they are in trouble. The child guidance center also gives the book tochildren when they are sent to foster or institutional care. Human Rights Watchasked five high school students whether they actually used the guidebook; onlyone knew what it was.[130]To satisfy the above-mentioned national governmentstandards, many child care institutions set up an external third-partycommittee consisting of experts, lawyers, scholars, and others, to provideexternal supervision and to ensure that children can voice their concerns topeople outside the institution.But the operation of the system depends on each institution,and there is a wide range of actual engagement between the third-partycommittee and the institution. For example, Human Rights Watch found that someinstitutions have the third-party committee members over for dinner every monthto communicate with the children.[131] Butother institutions only organize an annual visit to their facility of thecommittee members, who hardly interact with the children. Some interviewees pointedout that committee members are not properly selected at someinstitutions—for example, because they are local notables rather thanpeople with specific expertise in children’s issues.[132]At a house-based institutional care facility run by thechild care institution Meguro Wakabaryo in Tokyo, sketches of the third-partymembers’ faces alongside their contact information hung visibly in thedining room. Asked if they knew the people pictured, one child answered,“I know one of them but I don’t know the rest.”[133]In other institutions, information about the third-party committee members isposted in obscure locations.Professor Hiroyasu Hayashi, who sits on the advisory councilof the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, told Human Rights Watch:Both the third-party committee and the opinion box haveturned into mere formalities and serve no practical purpose. TheChildren’s Rights Guidebook is not used properly because the childrenjust throw it away. In order to put it to real use, we need to make sure thatthe information will actually reach the children by going through the contentwith them or through other methods.[134]Other suggestions for accountability mechanisms includesetting up a toll-free contact number that a child could call to consult aboutproblems, or distributing a pre-paid postcard (addressed to local governments,the child guidance center, or nonprofit child advocacy groups) for mailingcomments and complaints.Since 2012, third-party assessments by an external partyhave been mandatory for every child care institution and must be conductedevery three years. According to Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, theobjective of the third-party evaluation is to pursue a higher quality ofwelfare services while administrative inspections ensure that organizations aresatisfying minimum standards.[135]Professor Hiroyasu Hayashi also pointed out, however, thatthis has not developed into a significant or comprehensive enough evaluationprocess that could uncover and investigate children’s claims andcomplaints, and that the assessments have largely remained a formality withlittle significant impact.[136]Moreover, the government’s current regulations undermine the independenceand impartiality of the assessments by granting institutions the right toselect which organization would conduct the required external evaluation of theestablishment.[137]III. Problems in Foster Care SystemOnly 14.8 percent of the children who need alternative carein Japan are placed with foster parents.[138]In 2010, the government set a goal to increase thepercentage of children placed into the foster system to 16 percent by 2014. Furthermore,in 2011, an additional goal was set to change the distribution ofchildren’s placement in alternative care during the next 10-plus years toan equal ratio between main institutions (with capacity up to 45 children),house-based institutional care (for up to 6 children in settings like a localresidence under the main institution’s management), and foster parentcare.[139]These figures still compare poorly to many developed countries, where 70 to 90percent of children requiring alternative care are placed into foster parentcare.[140]In recent years, the Japanese government has taken a numberof steps to improve and expand the use of foster care. Although these changesare mostly positive, as this section details, problems persist, and a strongpreference for institutionalization remains, which impedes the extent andlikelihood of crucial reform.Recent Steps TakenMeasured as a percentage of the children receiving care, theproportion of foster-parented children (including foster family group homes)has increased in the past decade from 7.4 percent (2,517 children) in 2002 to13.5 percent (4,966 children) in 2011.The Japanese government has implementedvarious measures to promote foster care system in the past decade, including:Establishing “specialized fosterparent” and “kinship-based foster parent” status;[141]Implementing “respitecare”—a service that offers foster parents a chance to take a breakfrom child caring;Deploying special committee to promotechildren’s placement in foster care who can discuss how to increase thefoster care placement and how to support foster care.[142]Implementing foster parent supportorganization projects (e.g., outsourcing foster parent support to privatenonprofit organizations);Founding the Foster Family Group Homesystem, which provides family-based care for five to six children in aresidential settings;Significantly increasing the foster parentallowance;[143]andIssuing the Foster Parents PlacementGuidelines (on March 30, 2011, revised on September 1, 2011 and March 29, 2012)declaring the Foster Parents First Principle. Under the principle, the childguidance center must consider foster care for children in social care beforeinstitutional care.[144]These are useful steps. But problems persist with the fostercare system in ways and for reasons detailed below.Abuse in Foster CareSystemIncidents of physical, mental, and sexual abuse persist inthe foster care system, just as they do in institutions. In fact, informationcollected by the government’s child abuse reporting system for childrenin alternative care show that the percentage of abuses at the hands of fosterparents is higher than abuses recorded among children in an institutional careenvironment.[145] Careis harder to monitor because it occurs in a private family environment, andthere is a higher risk than in institutions that it will take outside monitorslonger to detect abuse. Failure by the government system and local officials toeffectively monitor foster care placements and provide adequate support tofoster parents and children placed with them is clearly a major problem.In the worst (but very rare instances), children have diedin foster parent care. One case from Suginami Ward, Tokyo, in 2010, receivedconsiderable media attention. On the evening of August 23, 2010, foster motherShizuka Suzuike allegedly struck her foster child Miyuki Watanabe, age 3 yearsand 7 months, in the head and the face multiple times over a five-hour period.The violence caused numerous injuries, leading to Miyuki’s death at 2a.m. on August 24.[146] Attrial, Suzuike denied responsibility for the child’s death, claiming anunknown person had broken into the house and beaten the child. However, theTokyo District Court found the defendant guilty and sentenced her to nineyears’ imprisonment on the charge of injury causing death.[147]Although Suzuike maintained her innocence, the Supreme Court rejected herappeal in February 2014 and upheld the ruling.In another case in Utsunomiya in 2002, a foster child waskilled by her foster parent. And in 2006, a one-year-old child in Sakura, Chibawho would not stop crying died after being strongly shaken by their fosterparent. [148]Several more cases of foster parents injuring their fosterchild have been reported in recent years. For example, in February 2009 policearrested foster mother Yasuko Nemoto in Hokkaido because she stuck a pin in theneck of her seven-month-old foster child. The girl took two weeks to recover. Acourt found Nemoto guilty of causing injury and fined her.[149]In May 2009, a five-year-old foster child from Osaka suffered lacerations atthe hands of her foster parent, Yoko Yoshimura, which were so serious they tooksix months to heal. The Osaka District court sentenced Yoshimura to three yearsimprisonment, but with a suspended sentence for five years.[150]And in August 2009, in Miyazaki, foster mother Kei Yasunamibit her six-month-old foster child’s buttock, resulting in an injury thattook a month to heal. Police arrested her on the criminal charge of causinginjury and a court sentenced her to 10 months imprisonment, with the sentencesuspended for three years.[151]Over-Institutionalizationand Slow Increase in Foster PlacementsAlthough Japan’s government has started to encourage fosterparent placement since mid-2000s, the decisions of the child guidance center—theauthority that determines where the children should be placed—has shownlittle progress and most of the children are ending up in institutions.While the child guidance center’s decisions should beguided solely by the best interest of child, in reality they take intoconsideration other conflicting interests, such as keeping good communicationswith biological parents and not invoking a time consuming judicial process,which appear to contribute to over-institutionalization.There seems little prospect that encouraging favorableattitudes to prioritize foster care placement will translate into the increasedfoster care decisions by the centers in line with international human rightsstandards.While the number of children being placed in foster careincreased in the last decade, for example, from 2,517 in 2002 to 4,966 in 2011,the number of children being admitted to child care institutions has also increasedslightly in the past 10 years from 31,592 children in 2002 to 31,693 childrenin 2011.[152] Whilesome observers view these trends as proof that the proportion of children infoster parent arrangements are gradually increasing, others are more critical,analyzing the increase only as the result of the increase of the total numberof children being placed into care.Some children who could not enter a child care institutiondue to overcapacity were merely diverted to foster parents, leading some expertsand foster parents to conclude the increase in foster care placements wereneither intentional nor the result of active involvement of the Japanesegovernment.[153]The plan to reach a target of one-third of children infoster parent care, when considered together with the plan’s slowimplementation, shows the government’s measures are generally inadequate.Moreover, many people involved in alternative care question both these goalsand whether the government plan can actually be implemented, pointing out thatbudget plans to support the changes are also unclear.[154]The government also erodes compliance with the FosterParents First Principle in the Foster Parents Placement Guidelinesby permitting exceptions. For example, the guidelines allow a child to beinstitutionalized when they have “significant psychological problems andtherefore special care in the institution is desirable,” or when “theparents/legal guardian(s) clearly disagree with foster parent placement (exceptfor article 28 cases).” Another problematic exception is possible when“the parents/legal guardian(s) are difficult to handle including whens/he makes unreasonable demands.”The guidelines further allow the centers not to consider aninstitutionalized child for foster care until the biological parents cease tomeet the child for up to one year (and an infant, for six months).[155] This is particularly problematic for infants as it implies that aninfant, whose institutionalization is strictly restricted by UN Guidelines, canbe regularly be institutionalized for up to six months. In reality, most infants are in an institution for much longer than six months.Why do child guidance centers continue to place childrenwith institutions, not foster parents?First, institutions are located at the core of the currentalternative care system and have been handled that way for a long time. Centerstaff are often invested in continuing existing systems, such as child careinstitutions, and can point to reforms (such as reducing institution size andintroducing unit-based care) as further justification for their continuedpreference to send children to institutions. As a result, center staff oftenhesitate to hamper the relationship with institutions, which operate with government subsidies based on the numberof children they admit, by diverting children to foster care.Second, there is no adequate assistance for, or effectivemonitoring of, foster parents. This means that child guidance center staffmembers do not completely trust the foster parent as a genuinely appropriateoption to protect and support children. Wary of being held responsible forpossible foster parent abuse, many center staff members choose to send childrento established child care institutions.Third, because of a shortage of child guidance center staffsand lack of their specialties, the staff are not able to change the currentsituation which highly depends on institutions. Also, as discussed in greaterdetail in the next section, centers tend to prioritize the opinion ofbiological parents, who tend to prefer institutions, over the interest ofchildren.Children’s best interests will usually lie in properlydesigned, implemented, and monitored family-based care. To achieve this,government officials should assume that family-based care should generally bethe first choice for alternative care placements.The national government must immediately instruct localgovernments and child guidance centers to strictly adhere to the best interestof the child to overcome conflict of interests between biological parents andinstitutions. The government should also consider legal reform to address theembedded conflict of interest child guidance centers are involved in, and taskan independent mechanism, such as family court, to decide where they should receivecare in alternative care settings.Furthermore, reforms should be undertaken to shift relianceon institutions to reinforcing the foster parent system, and potential problemsimplementing foster-based care should be assessed and appropriate action taken,including, for example, better support for children in family-based care.[156]Staff members of child guidance centers, institutions,government policymakers, and other stakeholders should also change theirmindset to recognize that depriving children of family through unnecessaryinstitutionalization is itself abusive. Such changes in people’sperspectives about the best way to approach alternative child care shouldhappen at all administrative levels, including nationally at the Ministry ofHealth, Labor and Welfare, and locally at the level of prefectures, cities, andchild guidance centers around the country.The lack of foster care placement will likely neversignificantly change if existing institutional care facilities and the need toreform foster care are used as excuses to defend the status quo.Government officials should instead assume that family-basedcare should generally be the first choice. If, in fact, moving towards fosterparent systems face certain problems and issues in implementation, officialscould assess what kind of systems could counteract those problems, includingbetter support for children in family-based care, and take action accordingly.This change of perspective in assuming foster care, not institutional care, isthe desired result, could build the foundation for a better system in allaspects, from the reinforcement of detailed foster parent support to adequatehuman resource deployment in child guidance centers.Fukuoka and Oita Prefecture both saw a considerable increasein the percentage of children placed with foster parents in recent years, andserve as good examples of what is possible with the right approach.[157]Officials in these two prefectures pointed out that there is now “betterunderstanding of the effectiveness of the foster parent’s care among thechild guidance center staff” and “the child-centered viewpointbased on the concept of ‘assuring the best interests of the child’in encouraging foster parent’s care.”[158]The importance of attitude was noted during the July 2011National Child Guidance Center Directors Conference in Tokyo. Municipalitieswith low foster parent placement rates, it noted, tend to display “a highdegree of caution” when approaching child-care related issues,”while municipalities with higher foster care placement rates had a “forward-lookingattitude, while remaining cautious where needed, to overcome theseissues,” by, for example, considering foster parent care first forinfants before institutionalization. The conference noted:The positive and forward-looking attitudes of the childguidance center towards the family-based care in general, including infantplacements in the foster parent’s care, play an important role inincreasing the rate of new foster care placements.[159]From a cost perspective, italso makes sense to move away from institution-delivered care. One estimatesuggests that it costs the government 83,732,000 yen ($837,320) to bring up achild in public institutions in a large city from birth until 18, and as littleas 32 to 38 million yen ($320,000 to 380,000)[160]to raise a child from infancy to 18 in fosterparent care.[161]Biological Parents Controlover Child PlacementIt is customary for the Child Guidance Centers to obtain consent from a biological parent of a childbefore placing them in a foster family or child care institution. But, as acare worker at the Child Guidance Center in Tokyo told Human Rights Watch, itcan be difficult to obtain parental consent to place children in foster care inpart because “many fear that their child will be taken away by the fosterparents.”[162]As a care worker at an institution in Tsukuba said: “InJapan, the interest of the parents is seen as more important than the interestsof the child.”[163]Minoru Hasegawa, chief director at Miyagi Chuo ChildGuidance Center, told Human Rights Watch:Generally speaking, most parents probably agree with theoption of institutional care, in part because they are hoping to take theirchild back someday. There seems to be an image associated with the fosterparent system that the child becomes somebody else’s child.[164]Setsuko Yamamoto, who hasbeen a foster parent for 25 years, said:I always say it’s time that we left behind that kindof excuse [about foster parents]. It’s a matter of how you talk to theparents who don’t have much idea what alternative care is about. Theirattitudes change most of the time when you do it right…. It is really upto the child guidance center staff how they talk to the parents.[165]A care worker from an infantcare institution in Tokyo said that child guidance center staff could improve theirefforts to get the consent of biological parents:Even for those children for whom we request fosterparent’s care, the child guidance center staff most often respond bysaying they cannot get the parental consent. Sometimes we wish the child guidancecenter would try harder.[166]When biological parents donot agree to the decisions of the child guidance centers, the director of the center or each prefecture may apply to a family court for approval to place the child in aninstitution or foster care under article 28 of the Child Welfare Act by demonstrating that the child’s welfare is beingseriously violated in the parents’ custody.[167]In order to protect the bestinterests of the child, child guidance centers should invoke the article 28court process, when biological parents do not agree to placing their child intofoster care. However, child guidance centers are reluctant to use theprocedures. Out of 32,365 children either in child care institution and foster care in 2010, the childguidance center used the article 28 procedures only in 466 cases. Moreover, thecenters appear to have requested institution placement instead of foster carein this article 28 court process. Therefore, almost all article 28 cases resulted in the child being placed in institutionalcare. Court ordered placements account for only 18 cases out of 2,610 fosterparent placements, demonstrating that most children are put straight intoinstitutions when the parent does not consent to foster care.[168]The national government’s Foster Parent PlacementGuidelines also seem to tolerate the ongoing reluctance of the child guidance centersto invoke the article 28 legal motion. It says a child to be institutionalizedwhen “the parents/legal guardian(s) clearly disagree with foster parentplacement (except for article 28 cases),” without instructing the child guidancecenters to invoke the article 28 court process when biological parents do notagree with foster parent placement arrangements made by the child guidance centers.[169]While the court has approvedmost of the applications by the director of child guidance centers for alternativecare placement—in fact 85 percent [170]—child guidance centers often avoid invoking the article 28 procedure, saying it canbe troublesome and time consuming. Seeking a ruling on the application takestwo to four months on average after it is filed,[171] plus possibly another month if one considers thepreparation time before the legal motion is filed. During this time, the childis usually held in a “temporary custody” institution within a child guidance center. While there are no legal restrictions inplacing children with foster parents for the temporary custody during the waiting periodinvolved with the article 28 procedure, child guidance centers placechildren in the temporary custody facilityin almost all cases. The article 28 procedurealso requires another statement be filed with the family court two years laterfor status renewal.[172]One worker in a child guidancecenter in Iwate Prefecture explained:If we go through the article 28 procedure, the child willneed to stay in a facility for temporary custody for three or four monthsduring which he or she cannot even go to school. As long as the parent givesconsent for institutional placement, then an early placement in an institutionwould be a better solution for the children, wouldn’t it?[173]In addition, there is afinancial rationale for seeking to persuade parents to voluntarily surrendertheir child to the alternative care system: parents must pay fees to thegovernment for taking care of their children in the alternative care system. Ifthey do not give their consent, they often do not pay this fee.[174]Another significant obstaclearises from the government’s stated goal of promoting the return childrento their biological parents if possible, since some child guidance centers arereluctant to press forward with foster care, which they see as risking their continuingrelationship with the child’s biological parents. Minoru Hasegawa, chiefdirector of Miyagi Chuo Child Guidance Center, said:[175]We want to make best efforts not to have any conflicts withthe child’s parent for the sake of future possibilities. If we can returnthe child to the biological parent, that would be most desirable. So this iswhy it’s our preferred option to make efforts to obtain parental consent.Takeo H., 15, was strugglingliving in an institution where he had been placed when he was 3 years old. Aschool teacher with whom he discussed the idea of foster care sought todissuade him, telling him: “You might want to reflect a little bit morebecause you might not want to forget about your biological family [as youmight] if you live with a foster family.”Takeo told Human RightsWatch:I had never thought about it that way … but afterreflecting on what he told me, I began to see it that way…. I have afamily who raised me until I was three years old and I didn’t want to doanything that separated me from them.[176]He remains in institutionalcare. Takeo’s main communication with his biological parents since he wasfive has been via a letter sent each year on his birthday, and one meeting whenhe graduated from elementary school, although recently he said he had beencorresponding more regularly by mail with his mother.[177]Inadequate Resources in ChildGuidance CentersThe position of child guidancecenters is generally a decisive factor in the rate of foster parent placement.[178]But in the current system, many centers lack the resources tosupport foster parents adequately. As a result, they are often not eageror forward-looking in promoting foster care.“It takes time and effort to place a child underfoster parent care. It’s easier to put them in an institution withoutgoing through any troublesome, person-to-person process,” explained MikaHobbs, who fosters three children in Tokyo. She pointed out that child guidancecenters do not generally have time to carefully match potential foster parentsand a child.[179]For example, child guidance centersare responsible for visiting each foster family after a child’s placementthroughout the time they are in the placement, until the expiration of theplacement order.[180]A staff member of a child guidance center in Iwate prefecturesaid bluntly with respect to the foster parent system that “it is notpossible given our capacity to satisfy all requirements written in the foster parent placement guidelines.”[181]The chief director at the MiyagiChuo Child Guidance Center, Minoru Hasegawa, said there was“understandably pressure” on child guidance centers to avoid moreincidents like the Suginami case in 2010, when a foster parent allegedly killedthe child in her care.  He added:We cannot see [how things are] once the child is under thefoster parent’s care. Institutions, in that sense, are more accessible[for regulators] and the fact that the child is in a place we know makes usfeel safe in some ways.[182]Hiroyasu Hayashi, aconsulting member of Institutional Management and Foster Parent Care PoliciesWorking Group of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, pointed to thesheer number of tasks that child guidance centers must perform as the biggestobstacle to the growth of the foster parent system.[183]Child guidance centers alsohave other competing priorities for their work, including responding to reportsof abuses (which included over 65,000 cases in 2012). This sometimes limits theamount of resources available for other tasks including providing consultingservices.[184]For example, Jun Yahagi,deputy manager of Iwate Prefecture Miyako Child Guidance Center, told HumanRights Watch that he handled 127 new cases in a year on his own, in addition totaking care of deputy manager duties that involved administrative tasks,dealing with child care institutions, and attending foster parent meetings.[185]The number of child socialworkers in child guidance centers is also strikingly low compared to other developedcountries, resulting in large individual caseloads. For example, Osakaprefecture has only 108 child social workers for 6.2 million people; eachworker receives and handles 225 new cases per year, while continuing their workon cases from previous years. In comparison, New York City, with a populationof 8 million people, has 2,058 child protection workers who each handle 12 newcases on average per year. New Zealand has a population of 3.9 million people buthas 989 child social workers who each receive approximately 30 new cases year,including delinquency and alternative care cases.[186]Such demands mean it is not surprising that centers arequite conservative when it comes to promoting foster parent care, according toProfessor Tetsuo Tsuzaki. He said:There is no way that the child guidance center will pushforward with the foster parent placement which is much more demanding thaninstitutional care in terms of time, process, expertise, and efforts.[187]Many child guidance centerstaff also lack necessary expertise for their jobs—what TetsuroTsuzaki, former director of Osaka Chuo Child GuidanceCenter, referred to as “knowledge and know-how.”[188]Just 53 percent of center directors and 65 percent ofsocial workers have child care-related education and qualifications, accordingto governmentdata.[189]Often, educational backgrounds have little to do withchild care: the head of one Tokyo-based child guidance center, for example, is a doctor, but asurgeon.  It is also not uncommon to find that child guidance center staffmembers previously worked in a completely different field, such as constructionor waterworks.[190]Vested InstitutionalInterests, Lack of Investment“To be honest withyou,” the director of a child care institution in the Tohoku district told HumanRights Watch, “it’s not exactly ideal for us if there were no morechildren to be admitted to our institution because our operation is based onreceiving children to care for.”[191]The director’s remarkis unsurprising: child care institutions in Japan operate with subsidies theyreceive from the government based on the number of children they admit.A close relationship between childguidance center staff and the institution’s executives promotesplacements of children in institution instead of foster parent care. ProfessorTetsuo Tsuzaki observed that, “It has become customary for municipalityrelated personnel to try and work things out as smoothly as possible tominimize conflicts with the local childcare institutions,” which often results inmore child placements in institutions than in foster care.[192]More investment is needed in foster care if it is toflourish, according to Professor Hiroyasu Hayashi. He said:[If] we are to actually operate our system in a way that iscentered around the foster parent program, we will need to invest as much moneythere as we do in institutions. Japan spends too little money on the fosterparent system compared to Western counterparts.[193]Lack of Awareness about Foster CareSocial awareness regarding the foster parent system in Japanis very low. A study conducted in 2010 by the National Child Guidance CenterDirector Conference concluded that one reason the foster parent system hasexperienced limited growth is because “citizens have scarce awareness andinterest in participating in the child’s alternative care.”[194]In some prefecture and city governments, promotion of fosterparent placements has successfully increased. The child guidance centers inthose prefectures mentioned the importance of raising public awareness by collaboratingwith nonprofit organizations, creating and distributing leaflets, screeningvideos about foster parenting, and having foster parents share theirexperiences in information sessions.[195]Furthermore, in terms of successfully soliciting morepersons to become foster parent candidates, it is important that foster parentsare better understood by Japanese society and that social prejudice againstfoster parents ends.[196]Mika Hobbs, a foster mother caring for three foster children in Tokyo, toldHuman Rights Watch that some foster parents are reluctant to reveal they arefoster parents because of the accompanying social stigma, and also becausebelieve their children could be singled out and bullied at school.[197]Lack of Parent DiversityFoster parents often lack sufficient diversity to cater to awide range of children’s needs.“We don’t haveappropriate foster parents,” one representative of the Kesennuma ChildGuidance Center Branch Office said. “There are only five in our area. Wecould look for suitable foster parents for each child only if there are moreregistered foster parents.”[198]The director of a child careinstitution in Iwate told Human Rights Watch that “most of the childrenin alternative care have issues like a developmental disability and cannot behandled by foster parents. We also lack foster parents with technical skills.Even specialized foster parents are not specialists in real sense.”[199]While child guidance centers have invariably recommended ahousehold with a dedicated homemaker to be foster parents, more needs to be doneto encourage households where both partners work to be foster parents, andunmarried individuals as well as LGBT couples should also be considered.[200]More also needs to be done to develop kinship-based fostering. Countries with ahigh rate of foster parent placements show an extensive use of thekinship-based foster parent system. Whilechild placements in the kinship-based foster parent’s care in Japan makeup around 1.7 percent of the total of alternative care placements, theycomprised 18 percent of placements in the United Kingdom, 23 percent in theUnited States, and 40 percent in Australia.[201]There is also a lack of foster parents registered for thespecialized foster care program set up to care for children who are abusevictims, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.[202]The ministry is aiming at recruiting a total of 800 special foster parents.Recruiting more people for the specialized foster parents program and improvingtheir training is a must. One more option is to implement a professional fosterparent system that would be better equipped to care for children with a severedisability who are difficult even for specialized foster parents to handle.[203]Furthermore, when necessary, another solution to overcomethe lack of foster parent diversity could be to promote cross-prefectural childplacements to ensure that children are matched with appropriate foster parents.Although such cross-prefectural placements are possible, there are not manycases where children are placed in foster family located in a differentprefecture.[204]InappropriateCertification and MatchingThe certification process is a very lenient for fosterparents. Katsumi Takenaka, formerly in institutional care and currently afoster father, describes it as “passable as long as one is over a certainage, married, and does not have a criminal record.”[205]One child guidance center staff member admitted to HumanRights Watch that “it is difficult to reject a foster parentapplication” unless age, residential space, or income conditions comeinto play.[206]Jun Yahagi, deputy manager at Iwate Miyako Child Guidance Center, told HumanRights Watch that some people are certified as foster parents despite clearlybeing inappropriate.[207] Fosterparents whom center staff view as unsuitable may spend years on the fosterparent list without any children placed under their care.There are as many as 5,434 households without any fosterchild out of the national total of 8,726 registered foster parent households.[208]A child guidance center staff member in Tokyo explained the gap by saying theyneed many candidates to make the best possible matches for children havingdiverse needs. But Katsumi Takenaka, a foster parent in Tokyo, said, “Thecertification process for foster parents needs to be more careful andstringent, but at the same time those who were successfully registered asfoster parents should immediately receive a child for care.”He claimed that newly registered foster parents may losetheir initial motivation and passion if no child is placed under their care forseveral years.[209]Professor Tetsuo Tsuzaki said to Human Rights Watch that thefoster parents assessment and matching process, as well as certificationprocess, should be much stricter, pointing out the Utsunomiya case in 2002 inwhich a foster mother killed a foster girl. In that case, the foster mother wasa non-Japanese woman not fully proficient in the Japanese language and wasstressed by isolation from the Japanese society. Although the main care giver wasthe foster mother, the child guidance center communicated with the fosterfather. In addition, the 3-year-old child had a severe attachment disorder. ProfessorTsuzaki said he found persuasive the claim that the disastrous outcome in thecase resulted from a high risk parent being matched with a high risk child.[210]A former child guidance center staff told Human Rights Watchthat he had not conducted enough inspections and assessments of the fosterparents in question, and that he regretted placing some children ininappropriate foster families. He cited a case in which he had placed a childwith foster parents without closely assessing the particular case because aprior placement of another foster child to that foster family had gone well. Butthe second child’s placement did not work out and the foster parents sentthe child back to the institution. In another case, he thought a foster familywas appropriate based on the information he received from documents, but afterthe placement, he learned that only the husband wanted to take a child, but notthe wife.He also told Human Rights Watch that child guidance center staffcannot reject registration of foster parents that they think are inappropriate.He explained that one of reasons for this is because in Japan some potential fosterparent candidates think the foster parent system is the same as adoption, andmany foster parents apply because they cannot have their own biological child.These foster parents say to the staff, “Why do you reject us? We have ourright to have a baby.”[211]Insufficient Preparation andAfter-Placement Support for Foster ParentsFoster parents received six days of mandatory trainingbefore certification: three days in a classroom and three days of practical training.The training is based on a national guideline but each prefecture devises andconducts its own programs.[212] Nostudy has yet been conducted into the outcomes of the training since it becamemandatory in 2008.The training should provide information on the role ofalternative care in society. Given the circumstances in which more than half ofthe children in the alternative care are victims of abuse, it is crucial thattraining focuses on practical aspects of care giving in difficult situationsand emphasizes the important role that foster parents play in caring forchildren traumatized by abuse—something currently apparently lacking.[213]Many foster parents we interviewed also said that child guidancecenters provided little or no aftercare. One Tokyo-based foster parent toldHuman Rights Watch, “Home visits only happen once a year or somethinglike that.”[214] Anothersaid:Generally speaking, the child guidance center staffdoesn’t even come around once a year after things settle down. It’shard to consult or rely on them as well since workers change every two, threeyears.[215]Support for foster families through frequent home visits,observation, and consultation are vital, especially since nearly a quarter offoster care placements result in a mismatch and the child is sent back to theinstitution.[216]Professor Tetsuo Tsuzaki said:Foster parents do not simply come around, foster parentsshould be fostered and supported by the government administration as a preciousresource for child welfare, as a resource which should be prioritized overinstitutions to look after the children in need. Training and support breedfoster parents.[217]Nearly half of specialized foster parents report that theyhave cancelled one or more of their foster care arrangements for a placed childin the past, but there is little information available about why they didso.  These statistics indicate that even experienced foster parents faceissues they cannot overcome,[218] andthat system reform is crucial in order to better detect problems that fosterparents face and improve placements at an early stage.Foster parents who fear losing their foster child said theydo not consider the child guidance center, which has discretion to end theplacement, to be an appropriate institution for discussing placement-related problemsor seeking advice. According to foster parent Naoko Yoshida: “I wasconstantly nervous about the relationship with the child guidance center andthe institutions. I did not even think of forming a partnership with them.[219]Some support for foster parents is currently provided bynongovernmental organizations, foster parents groups, and private organizationsthat are entrusted to undertake these functions by the local government. Childcare institutions and infant care institutions, which now hold foster parentsupport advisors, and child and family support centers established alongsidethe main institutions, also provide foster parent support.[220]However, this support remains limited in scope.In addition, foster parents often receive insufficientinformation about the background and needs of a child before placement, whichcan make it difficult for them to decide the best guidance and care for thechild. Keiji Umehara, a foster parent in Osaka, told Human Rights Watch:Although there have been some improvements in the recentyears, we are not given enough information about the child regarding his or herbackground and the environment in which the child had been raised before.[221]UnrealisticExpectations of Foster ParentsChild guidance center staffsaid that foster parents generally prefer a foster child who is healthy (withno disabilities), very young, and female.[222]Child guidance center staff said that foster parentsfrequently complain if they find out that their foster child turns out to havea disability. One staff member from a child guidance center in Tokyo said:If a child is a year old or younger, it is still too earlyto tell if he or she has a disability so we normally end up waiting until theyare 2 or 3 years old before we can place them in foster parent’s care.[223]A staff member from theFutaba Infant Care Institution told Human Rights Watch about a child who wasplaced in foster care but “was sent back after a little while because thefoster parents didn’t like the shape of the child’s ears, whichbecame apparent after having a haircut.”[224]In general, institutional personnel said that theyfrequently saw that “a placed child is sent back after a short while dueto unsatisfactory foster parent placement.”[225]Problems AdoptingAdoption is an appropriate and permanent solution forchildren. But despite the national government’s “Notice on AdoptionAdministration,” which directs child guidance centers to try to arrange adoptionfor children,[226]the centers have not prioritized adoption in their work, and therefore only around250 to 300 children were adopted through centers annually from 2008 to 2011.[227]One reason that child guidance centers do not make adoptiona priority is because centers are already busy with responding to urgent abusecases, and it is easier and less time consuming to send a child already intheir custody to an institution rather than individually arranging an adoption.[228]A large number of childrenincluding infants are in need of a permanent place to live, and often thesecases are quite serious. According toTokuji Yamanda, a former child social worker in Aichi prefecture, “abuserelated deaths of children [in Japan] most often occurs soon after they areborn” and that more than half of such deaths occur when the child is lessthan one month old.[229]He said that these infantsshould be adopted through the special adoption system. The child guidance centerin Aichi prefecture has been active on promoting the special adoptions by conducting consultations with pregnant women as well as placing newbornbabies with foster parents who seek specialadoption. However, this is an exception and only a few child guidance centers are active on adoption. Yamanda told Human Rights Watch that “childguidance centers are reluctant to do that because they do not have the know-howand do not want to come into collision with infant care institutions.”[230]Under the current system, adoptive parents or adoptivefoster parents who eventually adopt are neither obligated, nor receive thechance, to receive training. Adoptive parents also do not receive other assistancefrom the child guidance center. Adoptive foster parents also receive onlylimited financial support, which does not include the foster parents’allowance. Some Japanese child care experts have recommended that adoptivefoster parents and adoptive parents receive child care training and, whennecessary, deserve similar support and assistance to that received by fosterparents.[231]IV. Lack of Support for Independent LivingWhen I was leaving the institution, I was excited,thinking, “Finally I’m out of this prison!” But life is notsuch a smooth ride. A day feels like it never ends. I cannot enjoy my life.—Masashi Suzuki, 21, Chiba, June 2012A major problem faced by people who grow up in alternativecare is how to live independently after graduating from their care program. InJapan, few children become completely independent from their parents at the ageof 18. But participation in the alternative child care system can be terminatedas soon as a child over 15 leaves school. Even children who successfullygraduate from high school are expected to start living on their own as soon asthey graduate.The Child Welfare Act provides that alternative care, whennecessary, can be extended until a person turns 20 years old, and the Ministryof Health, Labor and Welfare issued a recommendation in 2011 to actively extendthe period of alternative care measures.[232] In reality, however, childguidance centers reject many applications for an extension.[233]Once support is terminated, individuals lose their place tolive. With no one to rely on, the life awaiting these young people is quitedifferent from that facing people of a similar age who live in a family.Individuals who grow up in alternative care institutions are much less likelyto go on to higher education or hold a steady job than those who grow up infamilies. As Yuji Morita, the director of a child care institution in Chibaexplained:The current system is producing more citizens who needsocial welfare and other forms of public money after being released frominstitutions, thus making them a burden on society.[234]A Path to HomelessnessThe connection between leaving institutional care andhomelessness has not been given adequate attention in Japan.[235]However, once individuals lose their access to staying in an institution,combined with low wages for menial entry-level jobs, many young people cannotstay on the same job that the institution helps them find when they leaveinstitutional care. If they leave that first job, they struggle to find another.[236]Masashi Suzuki, 21, grew upin a child care institution in Chiba from the age of 2 until 18.He has changed jobs at least 20 times in the three years since he left theinstitution. The furnishings company where he got his first job upon leaving theinstitution gave him little work and the monthly pay of 20,000 yen (US$200) washardly enough to survive on.[237]The financial aid he received from thegovernment to start an independentlife after leaving the childcare institution was entirely used up purchasingfurniture and buying other basic necessities to prepare his own apartment.[238]After less than half a year, he could not afford therent and became homeless, sheltering in a mangacafe[239]or wherever he could.[240]Those who start working straight after graduating fromjunior high school and are forced to leave their institutional care facilitymay be at a particularly high risk of becoming homeless.[241] YuKato (pseudonym), 29, was 15 when he left his child care institution because hedecided not to go to high school. He returned home to live with his biologicalfather, but ended up being abused once again and moved out. After working atvarious jobs, he eventually became homeless and has been on social welfarecontinuously ever since. Yu said he wishes he had been allowed to live in thealternative care until he turned 18.[242]Limited Access to HigherEducationJust 73 percent of children living in the alternative caresystem complete high school in Tokyo, and just 15 percent of children inalternative care complete a higher education (a course of study in auniversity, college, or vocational school) in Tokyo.For children in the general population of Tokyo, schooladmissions start higher, with 98 percent of children in Tokyo entering highschool and 65.4 percent going to higher education in Tokyo.[243]National high school completion rates stand at 81.5 percent, and highereducation graduation rates are 36.1 percent in Japan.[244]A 28-year-old man in Chiba who was formerly in institutionalcare, told Human Rights Watch that he started working right after graduatingfrom high school, giving up his desire to study further. He said,“It’s impossible for those who don’t have parental [financial]support to get higher education. I wanted to go to a college, too.”[245]In Japan, education can be free only until high school. Thosewho wish to obtain higher education after high school must invariably overcomefinancial shortcomings to study and save for education expenses after highschool. One 19-year-old who was formerly in a child-care institution, and isnow a vocational school student said:Even if we wanted to participate in extracurricularactivities in high school, we can’t because we need to get a part-timejob right after we get into high school because we need money if we are to gethigher education. Some people I know even work seven days a week. But then thatdoesn’t leave us much time to study.[246]Some high school students also told Human Rights Watch thatthey give up on the possibility of continuing their studies because they lackinformation about opportunities.[247]“Weneed more information on scholarship programs,” one high school studentin institutional care told Human Rights Watch.[248]As Sayuri Watai, chairperson of a self-help group of formerchildren from alternative care, said: “Investment in children’sacademics has evident returns for their future.”[249]Inability to Find a Guarantor,Afford a Driver’s LicenseIn Japan, individuals, regardless of age, need a“guarantor” to get an apartment or a job. Excluding a very limitednumber of cases, apartment lease agreements as well as employment contractswill always require an applicant to provide a guarantor. Individuals under 20years old may also have trouble getting a mobile phone if they do not have anyperson with parental authority. Typically, family members take care of thesearrangements. But children coming from an alternative care background usuallyhave no one to serve this function.[250]“The biggest problem of our society is that socialsystems exist on the assumption that one has a family and support,”[251]said Tuyoshi Inaba who works at Moyai, a homeless support organization.In 2007, the Japanese government issued an ordinance whichencourages the directors of alternative care institutions, child guidance centers,and foster parents to act as  guarantors for youth leaving alternativecare to seek a job and apartment. However, the government encourages thosepeople to give this support only for one year after the child leaves theinstitution or foster care arrangement.[252]Consequently, some former residents of alternative care have difficulties, andare unable to find a job or apartment. Kouichiro Miura, a 35-year-old man inTokyo who grew up in an institution, told Human Rights Watch that he was askedfor a guarantor after passing his employment examination for a securitiescompany after graduating from high school but “could not get the job fornot having one.”[253]Another significant hurdle for people coming from aninstitution is paying for a driver’s license, which costs between 200,000to 300,000 yen ($2,000-3,000) and is often needed for jobs such as constructionworkers or craftsman that are popular among male graduates of childcareinstitutions. From FY 2012, the national government decided that it wouldprovide 55,000 yen ($550) for those in the alternative care program who are intheir senior year of high school as a support grant for obtaining adriver’s license or other activities involved in preparing for a job.[254]However, this amount is far from sufficient.Need for Post-GraduationIndependence SupportAmi Takahashi is constantly on the move between municipaloffices, hospitals, police stations, and lawyers’ offices. She is thedirector of the After Care Support Center “Yuzuriha,” anorganization that provides support for people who used to be in child careinstitutions. Yuzuriha is one of the few support centers in Japan for those whoseek assistance after leaving institutional care.Many who come to Yuzuriha are experiencing pressing problemsthat could even put their lives at risk.The flow of people visiting Yuzurhia’s small office in a residential areain Tokyo never seems to slow down. Two full-time workers and one part-timeworker conducted consultations and follow-up with 4,280 people in need in 2011.[255] Many visitors are junior-high school graduates whodropped out of high school.Takahashi told Human RightsWatch: “Those released from institutional care] manage their living witha shockingly miniscule pay like 120,000 or 130,000 yen ($1,200 or 1,300) a month after tax.” Having no parent and nowhere to go for help,many “live under pressure that they cannot even afford to be sick andsome of them develop psychological problems as a result of the stress.” Takahashi said that in her experience many formerlyinstitutionalized youths never complete high school and often end up as welfarerecipients, homeless, or in prison.[256] She said homeless support organizations criticizechild care institutions saying, “Those young people were supposedlyprotected growing up under the welfare system and yet, what kind of life dothese institutions force on the children?”“Some are still tootraumatized to properly communicate with other people and others freeze whenreprimanded or warned about something due to flashbacks,” Takahashi continued. The oldest persons among those whom Yuzurihasupports are in their 40s. “Still now,they are struggling. Time does not fix things. It’s important that issuesare detected early and plentiful protections are provided.”[257]Kouichirou Miura, 35, grew upin an institution. He told Human Rights Watch, “We don’t haveanywhere to run back to.” After graduating from high school at the age of18, he went to Tokyo. The institution stafftold him when he left, “Turn to the government for help if you are inreal trouble.” After changing from one job to another, he becameunemployed at the age of 19 and his money dwindled to 5,000 yen ($50). He said:I went to a government office to get some help but wastold, “You were already helped to graduate from high school [by thecountry’s tax money] so you shouldn’t be needing any more help tocover your living expenses,” and was sent away. I learned then that Icouldn’t rely on the government.[258]Ayumi Takagi (pseudonym), a 24-year-old woman from Ibarakiwho was formerly in institutional care said, “I didn’t have anybodyto talk to after I left the institution. My parents abandoned me when I was twomonths old so there was no way that I could go back to them. I couldn’tgo back to the institution and didn’t want to either.” Having tolive on her own, she earned her living through sex work. “I was happythat somebody, even though a stranger, actually listened to me. I was lookingfor a place where I belonged.”[259]There is no specific publicsupport system targeted to assist those who graduated from the alternative careprogram, although some institutions in Tokyoand other areas are deploying independence support counselors to provideaftercare for the post-release youth. Kiyomi Morikawa, a 30-year-oldwoman who grew up in a child care institution inChiba said, “What you need after leavingthe institution is someone, even just one, to whom you can talk abouteverything.”[260]Some of the graduated youths gather in self-help groupscomposed of people who have departed institutional care or foster family homes.One of the self-help groups in Tokyo is called Hinatabokko (“Basking inthe sun”), and it serves as a place for youth to casually stop by andknow there is a place where they can feel they belong, and receive assuranceand support, before going back to their own daily lives again. “This iswhere I belong,” said Kouichirou Miura, who frequently goes toHinatabokko.[261]However, there are only about 10 such self-help groupsaround the country, and the activities of many of them are still in adevelopmental stage and not sufficient to meet needs. In addition, manygraduates from child care institutions do not know these groups exist.Failure to Follow-Up onInstitutional Care GraduatesUntil recently, it was up toeach institution to keep track of the status of their graduated youths. It wasnot uncommon to come across institutions that said they had lost contact withtheir graduated youths just one year after their release. To date, there hasbeen no comprehensive national study or statistics on the status of youths whowere part of the institutional or foster parents care systems. As aresult, there is little understanding of the full gamut of problems and issuesthat they have faced, continue to endure, or what kind of support they mostneed. “Proper studies need to be done in order to clarify what goals wereachieved through the alternative care system and whether the measures takenwere the right ones,” said Sayuri Watai, head of the self-help groupHinatabokko.[262]At the time of writing, the only existing governmentstatistics come from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in a study that coveredonly former children from institutions and foster families in Tokyo. The study,conducted from December 2010 to January 2011, revealed that graduates ofalternative care institutions face extreme challenges: their education level islow, so only a small percentage have a job with a formal contract, and theirincome level is also low.[263]The research was implemented through questionnaires sent to those whose addresswas identified by institutions, foster families, and others. This suggests thatthose most in need—without a proper place to stay or any form of networkto seek help—were likely left out of the study.[264]Former Foster Children and Independent LivingThe conditions of children in foster care transitioning toindependent living are relatively better than those in institutional care, butmany of the previous observations about the challenges of those leavingalternative care institutions are also true for foster children. Many fosterparents continue to provide accommodation to their foster children using theirown funds even after the child turns 18 and maintain a lifetime relationshipwith them.[265]However, the reliance on foster parent volunteers only increases the burden onfoster families and creates disparities in children’s conditions acrossdifferent foster families. Furthermore, it is more difficult for children infoster parents’ care than those in an institution to create their ownnetwork among similarly situated children.The university and collegeparticipation rate of children in the foster parent care program is 47 percent,higher than children in child care institutions.[266] But fosterchildren also face major financial challenges given the high cost ofcollege. As one foster mother told Human Rights Watch:I do want to send them to higher education programs butbecause I don’t have financial resources to do so, there is not much Ican do. I suggested to them to get a job first and save money as they can go touniversity anytime they want in the future.[267]V. International Human Rights StandardsThe preamble to theConvention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the family as the naturalenvironment for the growth and well-being of children. For the full and harmoniousdevelopment of their personality, children “should grow up in a familyenvironment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding.”[268]International human rights law ensures that thefamily is entitled to the widest possible protection and assistance by societyand the state.[269]The Convention on the Rightsof the Child obligates governments to ensure that a “child shall not beseparated from his or her parents against their will, except when competentauthorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicablelaw and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests ofthe child.” Such a determination may be necessary in a particular case,such as involving parental abuse or neglect.[270]The United Nations Guidelinesfor the Alternative Care of Children, which were adopted by the UN HumanRights Council in 2009 and welcomed by consensus by the UN General Assembly,are intended to enhance implementation of the Convention on the Rights of theChild “regarding the protection and well-being of children deprived ofparental care or who are at risk of being so.”[271] The guidelines start from the general principal thatefforts should primarily be directed to enabling children to remain in orreturn to the care of their parents, or when appropriate, other close familymembers. As a result, governments should ensure that families have access toforms of support in the caregiving role.[272]Removing a child from thecare of the family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should,whenever possible, be temporary and for the shortest possible duration.[273] Children temporarily or permanently deprived of theirfamily environment, or in whose best interests cannot be allowed to remain inthat environment, are entitled under the Convention on the Rights of the Childto special government protection and assistance.[274] Such alternative care can include “fosterplacement … adoption or, if necessary, placement in suitable institutionsfor the care of children.”[275]All decisions about thealternative care for children should be made on a case-by-case basis, andgrounded in the best interests and rights of the child concerned. Governmentsneed to ensure to a child who is capable of forming his or her own views the rightto express those views freely in all matters affecting the child. The views ofthe child should be given due consideration in accordance with thechild’s age and maturity.[276]All decisions concerningalternative care should take full account of the desirability, in principle, ofmaintaining the child as close as possible to his or her habitual place ofresidence, in order to facilitate contact and potential reintegration with thechild’s family and to minimize disruption of the child’s educational,cultural, and social life.[277]Decisions regarding childrenin alternative care should have due regard for the importance of ensuringchildren a stable home and of meeting their basic need for safe and continuousattachment to their care givers, with permanency generally being a key goal.[278]Residential InstitutionsMeasure of Last ResortThe Convention on the Rightsof the Child provides that one form of alternative care can include “ifnecessary,” placement in suitable institutions for the care of children.[279]This language indicates that institutions aregenerally less preferable than an alternative family, while recognizing thatfor some children institutional care may indeed be the best placement—forexample older teenagers nearing independence, large families of siblings whowish to remain together, or a child that has endured multiple foster carebreakdowns.Indeed, the Committee on theRights of the Child—the independent body of experts that monitorsstates’ compliance with the treaty—has stated that governmentsshould, “Ensure that the institutionalization of a child is a measure oflast resort and only occurs when family-type measures are considered inadequatefor a specific child.”[280]The committee has found thatplacing young children into institutions is particularly inappropriate:Research suggests that low-quality institutional care isunlikely to promote healthy physical and psychological development and can haveserious negative consequences for long-term social adjustment, especially forchildren under 3 but also for children under 5 years old. To the extent thatalternative care is required, early placement in family-based or family-likecare is more likely to produce positive outcomes for young children. Statesparties are encouraged to invest in and support forms of alternative care thatcan ensure security, continuity of care and affection, and the opportunity foryoung children to form long-term attachments based on mutual trust and respect,for example through fostering, adoption and support for members of extendedfamilies.[281]While accepting thatsometimes institutionalization may be necessary, the committee has stated thatcountries should ensure that “the placement of children in thesefacilities is regularly reviewed … to ensure that such placement is onlyused as the last resort and for the shortest time possible.”[282]The UN Alternative CareGuidelines also elaborate on the position of residential institutional care asa form of alternative care for children, stating:Use of residential care should be limited to cases wheresuch a setting is specifically appropriate, necessary and constructive for theindividual child concerned and in his/her best interests….[283]In accordance with the predominant opinion of experts,alternative care for young children, especially those under the age of 3 years,should be provided in family-based settings. Exceptions to this principle maybe warranted in order to prevent the separation of siblings and in cases wherethe placement is of an emergency nature or is for a predetermined and verylimited duration, with planned family reintegration or other appropriatelong-term care solution as its outcome….[284]While recognizing that residential care facilities andfamily-based care complement each other in meeting the needs of children, wherelarge residential care facilities (institutions) remain, alternatives should bedeveloped in the context of an overall deinstitutionalization strategy, withprecise goals and objectives, which will allow for their progressive elimination.To this end, countries should establish care standards to ensure the qualityand conditions that are conducive to the child’s development, such asindividualized and small-group care, and should evaluate existing facilitiesagainst these standards. Decisions regarding the establishment of, orpermission to establish, new residential care facilities, whether public orprivate, should take full account of this deinstitutionalization objective andstrategy….[285]The competent national or local authority should establishrigorous screening procedures to ensure that only appropriate admissions tosuch facilities are made….[286]States should ensure that there are sufficient carers inresidential care settings to allow individualized attention and to give thechild, where appropriate, the opportunity to bond with a specific carer.[287]Regarding the condition of such institutions, the UNGuidelines also provide that there should be “frequent inspectionscomprising both scheduled and unannounced visits.[288]Foster CareAlthough international standards recognize that fosterparents generally provide better care for children than institutional care,providing substantial financial and administrative support is important inorder to maintain a rights-respecting foster parent system. The UN AlternativeCare Guidelines point out administrative and other measures needed to provideappropriate foster parents systems:The competent authority or agency should devise a system,and should train concerned staff accordingly, to assess and match the needs ofthe child with the abilities and resources of potential carers and to prepareall concerned for the placement.A pool of accredited foster carers should be identified ineach locality who can provide children with care and protection whilemaintaining ties to family, community, and cultural group.Special preparation, support, and counselling services forfoster carers should be developed and made available to carers at regularintervals, before, during and after the placement.Carers should have, within fostering agencies and othersystems involved with children without parental care, the opportunity to maketheir voice heard and to influence policy.Encouragement should be given to the establishment ofassociations of foster carers that can provide important mutual support andcontribute to practice and policy development.[289]”AdoptionThe UN Alternative Care Guidelinesspecify that adoption is an appropriate and permanent solution. For each child,the government should make efforts to find an appropriate and permanentsolution before making other long-term arrangements, such as foster orinstitutional care.This is consistent with UN Alternative Care Guidelines thatsupport efforts to keep children in their family’s care, and should thisfail, to find another appropriate and permanent solution, such as adoption.Whatever solution is sought, the alternative care should be under conditions“that promote the child’s full and harmonious development.”[290]Thus, when agencies are approached by a parent wishing torelinquish a child permanently, and other care efforts by family members havefailed, the government should make efforts to find a permanent family placementsuch as adoption.The UN Alternative Care Guidelines provide that governmentofficials should ensure that the family receives counseling and social supportto assist them in caring for the child. If this fails, a social worker shoulddetermine whether there are other family members who wish to take permanentresponsibility for the child, and whether this would be in the best interestsof the child. The Guidelines state: “Where such arrangements are notpossible or are not in the best interests of the child, efforts should be madeto find a permanent family placement within a reasonable period.”[291]Children with DisabilitiesThe guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights ofPersons with Disabilities (CRPD),which Japan ratified in January2014, include dignity, autonomy, nondiscrimination, participation, inclusion,respect and acceptance, equality of opportunity, and accessibility for personswith disabilities.[292]The CRPD shifts the paradigm of disability rights:disability is no longer viewed as a medical condition of which someone needs tobe “cured.” Rather the treaty emphasizes that disability isinherently human, requiring society itself to adapt to ensure that persons withdisabilities are able to participate fully and equally in society.[293]The CRPD provides that respect to children with disabilities,governments should:[T]ake all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoymentby children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms onan equal basis with other children….In all actions concerning children with disabilities, the best interests of thechild shall be a primary consideration.[E]nsure that children with disabilities have the right to express their viewsfreely on all matters affecting them, their views being given due weight inaccordance with their age and maturity, on an equal basis with other children,and to be provided with disability and age-appropriate assistance to realizethat right.[294]The treaty articulates ashift from institutionalization to community-based living, with support asneeded.[295]The CRPD also sets outactions to take during situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, notingspecifically that governments should take, in accordance with theirinternational legal obligations, “all necessary measures to ensure theprotection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk,including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and theoccurrence of natural disasters.”[296]Right to Family Life for Children with DisabilitiesUnder the CRPD, governments should ensure that children withdisabilities have equal rights with respect to family life. To realize theserights, and to “prevent concealment, abandonment, neglect and segregationof children with disabilities,” governments are obligated “toprovide early and comprehensive information, services, and support to childrenwith disabilities and their families.”[297]Governments are also required to ensure that “a childis not separated from his or her parents against their will, except whencompetent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance withapplicable law and procedures, and that such separation is necessary for thebest interests of the child.” Furthermore, “In no case shall achild be separated from parents on the basis of a disability of either thechild or one or both of the parents.”[298]Non-Institutionalizationand Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in the CommunityIn instances where the immediate family is unable to carefor a child with disability, the CRPD requires that governments undertake everyeffort to provide alternative care within the wider family, and failing that,within the community in a family setting.[299]Under the CRPD, governments are obligated to recognize theequal right of everyone with disabilities to live in the community, withchoices equal to others, and to take effective and appropriate measures tofacilitate this right and their full inclusion and participation in thecommunity, including by ensuring that:Persons with disabilities have the opportunity to choosetheir place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basiswith others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement;…Persons with disabilities have access to a range ofin-home, residential and other community support services, including personalassistance necessary to support living and inclusion in the community, and toprevent isolation or segregation from the community.[300]The explicit right to live in the community contained in theCRDP stems from a long history of institutionalization of persons withdisabilities, which has increasingly been recognized as discriminatory andunnecessary.Countries should shift social service systems for childrenwith disabilities away from those focused on institutional care towards asystem of community-based support services, including housing.[301]Such a system should allow for equal choice, independence, and full inclusionand participation in the community. The lack of any reference in the CRPD toinstitutional housing and care reflects an evolving body of research andexperience that over the last 40 years has shown that even those with the mostsevere disabilities can live and integrate into the community if given adequatesupport.The committee of experts who oversee implementation of theCRPD has called on governments to take “immediate stepsto phase out and eliminate institutional-based care for people withdisabilities.”[302]Inclusive Education for Children with DisabilitiesInclusion in education is rooted in the concept thateveryone has the right to education. The CRPD obliges governments to guaranteean “inclusive education system at all levels.”[303]Specifically, the convention requires governments to ensure that children withdisabilities “are not excluded from the general education system on thebasis of disability” and that they have access to “inclusive,quality and free primary and secondary education on an equal basis with othersin the communities in which they live.”[304]The convention goes further by requiring governments to provide reasonableaccommodations and the “individual support required, within the generaleducation system, to facilitate their education...consistent with the goal offull inclusion.”The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also recognizedthe importance of modifications to school practices, provision of supportservices to students and training of mainstream teachers “to prepare themto teach children with diverse abilities and ensure that they achieve positiveeducational outcomes.”[305]In an inclusive education system, all students participatein ordinary classes in their district schools.[306]This includes “disabled and non-disabled, girls and boys, children frommajority and minority ethnic groups, refugees, children with health problems,working children, etc.”[307] Furthermore,inclusive education requires that students are provided with support servicesand an education based on their individual needs.[308]Inclusive education focuses on removing the barriers withinthe education system itself that exclude children with special educationalneeds and cause them to have negative experiences within school.[309]It places the burden on teachers and classrooms to adapt, rather than for thechild to change. Support services should be brought to the child, rather thanrelocating the child to the support services.[310]In an inclusive education classroom, children with disabilities have individualeducation programs to guide the teacher, parents and student on how to achievethe best educational outcomes for the child.Diversity in the classroom is understood to benefit allchildren, including by addressing stereotypes, and improving understanding andlearning. Studies in both Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) and non-OECD countries increasingly recognize that students withdisabilities achieve better academic results in inclusive environments,surrounded by their non-disabled peers and provided with special support whenneeded.[311] Asnoted by Vernor Muñoz, the former UN special rapporteur on the right toeducation, schools with an inclusive orientation are the most effective meansof combating discrimination, and are thus essential to securing the full rightto education for children with disabilities.[312]The Committee on the Rights of the Child also acknowledged that inclusiveeducation can show a child with a disability “that he or she hasrecognized identity and belongs to the community of learners, peers, andcitizens.”[313]Inclusive education needs to be distinguished from thesystem of integrated education. The latter focuses on developing the skills ofchildren with disabilities so that they can join a mainstream school, sometimesthrough classrooms located within the mainstream school itself. However, thismodel tends to regard the child itself as the problem rather than addressingwhether children with disabilities are in fact learning and the system-widebarriers in the education system.[314]Specialized classes within mainstream schools may be beneficial for somestudents with disabilities to complement or facilitate their participation inregular classes, such as to provide Braille training or physiotherapy.[315]Right to be Consulted and to be HeardThe Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out thatchildren have the right to express their views and their views should be givendue weight in accordance with the child’s age and maturity.[316]Therefore, a child has the right to be consulted as well as to be fullyinformed about the alternative care options.[317]The views of the child,including those with a disability, must be taken into account in order todetermine what are the best interests of the child not only at the time of theseparation from parents, but also at the time of decisions regarding placementin foster care or homes, development of care plans and their review, and visitswith parents and family.[318]Moreover, according to the UNGuidelines on Alternative Care:Children in care should have access to a known, effectiveand impartial mechanism whereby they can notify complaints or concernsregarding their treatment or conditions of placement. Such mechanisms shouldinclude initial consultation, feedback, implementation and furtherconsultation. Young people with previous care experience should be involved inthis process, and due weight being given to their opinions.[319]Support Systems for IndependenceThe UN guidelines recognize the importance of thepreparation and training for life after care. They also note that the childshould be allowed to be consulted with a specialized person regarding his orher independence when leaving care.[320]Committee on the Rights of the Child, ConcludingObservations on JapanThe Committee on the Rights of the Child monitorscountries’ compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Atits most recent review of Japan, in June 2010, the committee noted “with concern the lack of a policy on alternative,family-based care for children without parental care, the increase in thenumber of children taken into care away from their families, the inadequatestandards of many institutions, in spite of efforts to provide small-group andfamily-type care, and the reportedly widespread abuse of children inalternative care facilities.”[321]The committee expressedsupport for the mandatory training and increased allowance received by fosterparents, but was concerned that some categories of foster parents—adoptive foster parents and kinship basedfoster parents—are not financiallysupported.[322]The committee made thefollowing recommendations to Japan:Provide care for children in family-like settings,such as foster families or small group settings in residential care;Regularly monitor the quality of alternative caresettings, including foster care, and take steps to ensure the compliance of allcare settings with appropriate minimum standards;Investigate and prosecute those responsible forchild abuse in alternative care settings and ensure that victims of abuse haveaccess to complaints procedures, counselling, medical care and other recoveryassistance as appropriate;Make sure that financial support is provided to allfoster parents;Take into account the UN Guidelines on AlternativeCare of Children.[323]VI. Orphans of the 2011 Earthquake and TsunamiClick to expand ImageThe earthquake of March 11, 2011, was the strongest everrecorded in Japan, with a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale. The severityof the combined damage from the earthquake and resulting tsunami cripplednuclear power plants and inflicted unprecedented damage on the Tohoku region ofnortheast Japan. The disaster resulted in 15,884 deaths, 2,633 missing persons(now presumed dead), 127,302 completely destroyed houses, 272,849 halfdestroyed houses, 748,777 partially destroyed houses, and 58,421 destroyednon-house buildings.[324]Click to expand ImageElementary school students walk beside the rubble afterschool in the tsunami-devastated town of Otsuchi, Iwate prefecture, May 2011.© 2011 Toshifumi Kitamura /AFP/Getty Images.In addition, the disaster left 241 children completelyorphaned or without their legal guardian: 126 in Miyagi prefecture, 94 in Iwateprefecture, and 21 in Fukushima prefecture.[325]As of 2012, all but five of them were living with extended relatives. Of the remainingfive who were in child care institutions, two were in child care institutionbefore the earthquake.[326]Nationwide, a total of 1,483 children lost at least one of their parents to theearthquake and tsunami.[327]Right after the earthquake struck, child care institutionsand child guidance centers prepared to accept orphans at the national level.Yet when staff visited the evacuation centers a week after the disaster tocheck on the situation of orphans, all children who had lost their parents hadalready been taken in and were being cared for by relatives[328]—inmost cases, grandparents, uncles, and aunts, and older siblings over 20 yearsold. Many relatives who opted to care for the orphans were also victims of thedisaster themselves.Manami Kajiwara fromIshinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, was in first grade when the earthquake struck and the resultingtsunami swept her mother away. Previously, Manami had lived with her mother andgrandmother, but after the disaster she was left alone with her grandmother.Just like many other cities and towns along the coast of northeastern Japan,the tsunami caused catastrophic damage to Ishinomaki City, transforming thecity into mountains of debris. When Human Rights Watch met Manami, she and hergrandmother were living with Manami’s uncle and his family.Click to expand ImageChildren being visited by a Catholic sister at theearthquake-damaged Fujinosono child care institution in Ichinoseki, Iwateprefecture, November 2011. © 2011 Fulvio Zanettini/ADH/Laif/ReduxAfter living in an evacuation center for a few weeks and inan uncle’s house for two months, Manami was able to finally return to heroriginal house. When Human Rights Watch met her, her home was still surroundedby her largely destroyed neighborhood but she was keeping busy every day, goingto school and attending extracurricular activities. She said she is trying herbest to live a normal life, encouraging people around her. Seeing hergrandmother who still spends her days in tears mourning her lost daughter,Manami tried to cheer her up. On the flower Manami offered at hermother’s altar, she wrote: “Grandma, don’t cry.”[329]Use of Foster Care SystemTomoaki Hiraga, Ichinoseki Child Guidance Center director inIwate, said, “We as the Child Guidance Center actively promoted theapplication of the foster parent system” for the orphans.[330]As a result, the 168 people who accepted to take care of their relative’schild (after the child’s parent or parents died) all registered under thefoster parent system. Of those, 95 did so through the kinship-based fosterparent system and 73 through the regular foster parent system.[331]In the past, relatives with a third degree of relationshipcould only register under the kinship-based foster parent system, which doesnot grant any foster parent allowance, because the civil law defines them aspersons who are naturally responsible to support the child. However, after the2011 earthquake, a new government policy enabled the child’s uncle andaunt or relatives of a similar status to be certified as registered fosterparents and receive foster parent allowance.[332]The remaining 68 orphans, who are not under the fosterparent system, were adopted by their relatives or live with their other parentwho regained parental rights that had previously been lost after divorce.[333]A former staff member of Miyagi Chuo Child Guidance Centerwho was in charge of the foster parent system at the time of the earthquake,said that the disaster should provide the optimal opportunity to reconsiderwhat the country’s alternative care system should be like.[334]The former staffer said that soon after the earthquake, the phone at the centerkept ringing for days with domestic and also international calls from those whowished to foster any children in need.According to the Child andFamily Division of Iwate Prefectural Office Health and Welfare Department, thenumber of registered foster parents increased by 30 households annually afterthe earthquake and tsunami as opposed to the normal rate of approximately 15households a year beforehand.[335]Theearthquake increased the publicity around the foster parent system and helpedboost the number of people who wish to foster a child. The fact that most ofthe orphans who lost both of their parents to the disaster were taken into careby their relatives also represents an aspect of what protection and care forchildren should be like. Family-based care that provides a familiar environmentwith familiar people should be, in many cases, the form of alternative carethat is in the child’s best interests.Future ConcernsDespite the positive side of things, the difficulties thatrelatives who have taken on the care of children are considerable.The oldest kinship-based foster parent is 90-year-old NorioKato from Iwate Prefecture. He had been living with his oldest son and hisfamily but lost his oldest son to illness before the earthquake and hisdaughter-in-law to the disaster. Now he is left with two grandchildren, inthird grade and sixth grade. Managing his new life with the two children withthe help of a housekeeper who takes care of the household chores, his spirited,lively demeanor does not belie his nine decades. However, he expresses hisconcern saying, “I never know when my health will turn for the worse. Idon’t know how long I can look after these children.”[336]Initially, the child guidance center checked on the statusof these orphans once a month through home visits. However, many householdsobjected, saying that they are “simply keeping their normal lives asbefore as a family.” Many centers have reduced their number of visits inresponse.[337]Foster parent groups in each prefecture are also hosting gatherings on aregular basis to support the foster parents who have started caring for anorphan after the disaster. However, many of these relatives do not reallyconsider themselves to be “foster parents” and their attendance isinfrequent.[338]Concerns among some of the foster parents do exist, however,and problems in future years cannot be discounted. For example, an IwatePrefectural government official heard the following concern from the fosterparents:The junior high school boy [we’re taking care of]does not say much in general, nor does he express his grief regarding thedisaster or his longing for his parents. Is it okay to just leave him likethat?I’m concerned with what could happen in the futuregiven the environment of temporary shelters where multiple children of both sexesare living together in limited space.[339]Tadami Takahasi, president of the Iwate Foster Parentsassociation, told Human Rights Watch that although there were no special issuesfound with the orphans through 2012, some reports have reached the associationin 2013 showing some delinquent behavior among the orphans, even though thecases have not been severe.[340]Reports related to the Great Hanshin Awaji (Kobe) earthquakein 1995, in which more than 6,000 people died, show that issues aroundchildren, including psychological stress, most commonly becomes evident threeor four years after the incident.[341]Financial Security of the OrphansVarious forms of support from the government as well asdonations from nongovernmental sources have reached the orphans and to date,there has not been much indication that they have experienced financialhardship.Public funds include 5 million yen ($50,000) of disastercondolence money, 500,000 yen ($5,000) for the first distribution plus 815,000yen ($8,150) for the second distribution of donation money for disastervictims, and 65,741 yen ($657) monthly payments of a basic pension for eachbereaved family. There are also nongovernmental sources, such as 2.82 millionyen ($28,200) of Ashinaga one-time emergency relief grant and 3 million yen, or$30,000 from the Asahi Shimbun Social Welfare Organization child support fundfor elementary school children, 2 million yen (US$20,000) for junior-highschool children and 1.5 million yen (US$15,000) for high-school children.[342]A list of scholarships and support funds is put together on each prefecturalgovernment’s website homepage and there are many other public and privaterun support systems that are not included in this list.Some of the orphans ended up with over tens of millions ofyen, including inheritance from their parents’ estate as well asreceiving payouts from life insurance policies.[343]Indeed, the concentration of support on orphans has beenpointed out as a problem, creating a disparity between what they and othervictims have received. The director of the Ashinaga one-time emergency reliefgrant program told Human Rights Watch:Financially speaking, orphans are in a situation in whichpeople tell them they are “lucky” to be an orphan. There arechildren who had already been orphans before the disaster, single motherhouseholds, and households without income after the disaster cost them theirjobs. We want to extend our support to a wider range of people but thesituation is tough, because a considerable portion of donations is specificallygiven to children who lost one or both of their parents in the disaster and,thus, we cannot use the fund for other purposes.[344]A mother of one junior high school student and one highschool student told Human Rights Watch:Thankfully my family all survived, including my twochildren, and our house was only half-destroyed. But my husband, who is adesigner, lost most of his clients to the tsunami and hardly had any incomelast year. I check the newspaper section for victim support and grants everydaybut most of them are for children who lost one or both parents. Nothing isapplicable for our family and I’m now concerned whether we can send ourchildren to seek higher education.[345]Psycho-Social Assistance forAffected ChildrenWhile the recovery of the disaster victims’ livesdepends heavily upon the reconstruction of the area itself, the process hasonly been moving forward very slowly. Yoshinori Sato, a psychiatric nursinginstructor, told Human Rights Watch:After the disaster, children were having issues like badtemperament, moodiness and inability to sleep or eat. You can’t reallytell easily though that they lost their parents. I’ve been spending timeevery month for the past year with the children who lost one or both of theirparents, but most of them don’t mention anything related to it. Some kidsmay let spill a few words when they are playing but it doesn’t happenoften.”[346]Groups of child psychiatrists and counselors have visitedthe evacuation sites in Tohoku since the early days after the disaster to carefor children’s mental health. The child guidance centers in the regionhave also formed a team that included child counselors and experts to visitaffected children, respond to children who lost one or both parents, and toliaise with medical organizations whenever problems were detected.[347]Child psychiatrists have been consulted since the earthquakeand tsunami regarding symptoms of trauma such as unusual behavior, infantileregression, bed-wetting and crying in the night.[348]The mental distress experienced by children affected by thequake first came to light two years after the disaster. Kazuro Ovama, chief ofthe child care team in Miyagi prefectural government, told Human Rights Watchthat the children’s problematic behaviors were first reported from theaffected area in 2013.[349]From April 2012 to March 2013, Miyagi prefecture had the highest ratenationally of junior high school students who were not able to go to school.[350]Kazuo said it may have been a consequence of the earthquake.[351]In January 2014, a research team from the Ministry ofHealth, Labor and Welfare issued a report focusing on the situation during thefirst two years after the earthquake. It reported that 28 percent of the small children,from 3 to 6 years old, in the three affected prefectures (Iwate, Miyagiand Fukushima) suffer from what the reports called the “introvertissue” such as serious unease and depression, which sometimes manifestedin a reluctance to go outside and a strong preference to stay indoors. Theresearch mentioned that 21 percent of the children studied had what the reporttermed the “extrovert issue,” which included behavior to takeaggressive actions, and 26 percent of them showed what was termed“general issues,” which include difficulties in socialadaptability. The report concluded all of those children require medicaltreatment and some have multiple issues that require urgent action.[352]The fact that many children are now under the care of theirrelatives should not be a reason not to extend further attention. It isimportant that child guidance centers, schools, and communities collaborativelymonitor and interact with these children continually in order to identifydistress they may be experiencing.A number of care providers worry that psychosocial care forchildren in disaster-affected areas will not be adequate.[353]They point to very few psychiatrists for children in the region—forexample, in Iwate prefecture there is only one psychiatrist for childrenalthough the total population is 1.3 million. Asa result, the affected areas have been receiving external support fromchild psychiatrists and psychologists located elsewhere, but this cannotcontinue indefinitely.  Given such conditions, some local officials havecalled on the government to “set up a special team on constant standby tobe dispatched in emergency occurrences and stay in affected areas for a periodof months or years.”[354]Organizations like Ashinaga and Sendai Grief Care Societyhost monthly gatherings for the children in the area, mainly elementary schoolstudents, who lost one or both of their parents.  At these meetings, thechildren are able to meet similarly positioned peers as well as to play andtalk freely with facilitators.[355]Yoshinori Sato, organizer of the Sendai GriefCare Society, told Human Rights Watch that it takes time to care for thesechildren. He said, “I can’t say that this support can be a quickfix for their grief but I hope it will be one of the options for them.”[356]Yoshiji Hayashida, chief of the Ashinaga Sendai office, alsopointed out the difficulties of reaching children in need saying that “thosewho are suffering the most don’t come to gatherings. It’s importantto spread the word to those people that these gatherings exist.”[357]Furthermore, both organizations provide a place for parentalpsychological care through creating opportunities for the child’sguardians to interact and communicate with each other. “Usually parentsare more unstable mentally. And when the parent or guardian is not mentallystable, it is most certain that it echoes to the child as well. That’swhy parental psychological care is very important,” said Sato.[358]Another staff member from Ashinaga told Human Right Watchhow difficult it is to uncover the problems facing the children. She discussedher experience visiting one affected family saying:When I visited them at their house and talked to themother, she said, “My child is strong. He is always trying hard andI’m really getting strength from him. But I’m not strongenough,” bursting into tears. I then went to the child’s roomwondering if he was doing all right. It turned out he was crying like a baby.At the moment, I realized that the child is certainly going through a lot, too.He just doesn’t show it in front of his mother because of his sense ofresponsibility to support his mother.[359]She stressed her view that long-termmonitoring and care will be needed to support children in the region affectedby the earthquake and tsunami.[360]RecommendationsTo the Japanese DietTo Ensure that All Children Have an Opportunity to Grow Up in a FamilyRevise the Child Welfare Act so that  anindependent mechanism, such as family court, can  decide where a childshould be cared for in  the alternative care settings to ensure their bestinterests are met, in line with the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care ofChildren.Amend the Child Welfare Act and add adoptionand special adoption as measures of alternative care.To the Ministry of Health,Labor and WelfareTo Ensure that All Children Have an Opportunity to Grow Up in a FamilyClose all infant care institutions as partof a clear plan to transition the care of infants from institutions tofamilies. Ensure that the plan is time-bound and has adequate resources and politicalsupport to reach its goals. Provide children under the age of 3 years with carein family-based settings.Amend the Foster Parents PlacementGuidelines in line with the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children,which require that institutional care is limited to “cases where such asetting is specifically appropriate, necessary and constructive for the individualchild concerned and in his/her best interests,” and direct prefecturegovernments, ordinance designated cities and child guidance centers toimplement the revised guidelines. The amendments should include, among others, thelisted exceptions deemed suitable for institutional care, which significantlyundermine the "foster parents first policy" in the Foster Parents PlacementGuidelines;[361]Revisethe instruction on infants to comply with the UN Guidelines for the AlternativeCare of Children, which specifies that the alternative care of children,especially those under age 3, should be provided in family-based settings;Specifya certain short period, such as 6 months for a child and 3 months for an infant,as the maximum period a child can remain in an institution before being caredin family-based settings unless this is against the best interest of the child,by amending, among others, guidance that suggests a child can stay in aninstitution for 6 months or a year.[362]This setting should be temporary only until the institutions, such as infanthomes, are terminated.Directthe use of the Child Welfare Act article 28 court process to place childrenwith foster parents if any biological parents found to be abusive refuse togive consent to placing children in family-based care.Assign an independent panel of experts todevelop a set of policy recommendations to ensure that adoption is consideredwhen family reintegration proves impossible within an adequate and appropriateperiod, or return to the biological parents is considered contrary to the bestinterests of the child. The panel should:Considerways to make sure that adoptions are considered before any other long-termarrangements such as foster or institutional care;Utilizespecial adoption for newborns by consulting with pregnant women who are notwilling or able to raise their babies;Examinewhat, if any, support and training that the government provides foster parents,including foster parent allowance, is also desirable to be given to adoptivefoster parents and adoptive parents.Recommendconcrete measures to improve the child guidance center’s ability to promoteadoption, including providing necessary human resources.Cease building new child care institutionsand ensure that any construction of child care facilities, includinginfrastructure to support smaller-scale child care units, does not concentrateresources on institutional care options for children at the expense ofappropriate growth of care in a family. Review the government’s current goalof placing only one-third of children with foster parents or family home in“ten-plus years” from 2011, allowing the rest to be stillinstitutionalized and come up with a more robust goal for children to beadopted or placed with foster parents that aims to enable all children to havea chance to grow up in a family. This new goal should be developed along with aspecific plan of actions, supported by a finding scheme different from thecurrent, which incentives institutions to admit more children for moregovernment subsidies.To Ensure Better Foster ParentingMake sure that all foster parents, includingkinship-based foster parents and adoptive foster parents, receive adequatetraining, monitoring, and support including foster parent allowance. In orderto come up with the improved comprehensive programs, assign an independent panelof experts to make recommendations regarding the comprehensive trainingprograms, support programs, and monitoring mechanism of foster parents. Thepanel should examine the types of training foster parents currently receive,and conduct a training needs assessment. It should also recommend concretemeasures to improve the child guidance center’s ability to support fosterparents, including through home visits and more effective, regular monitoringsystems, and necessary human resources to implement such reforms.Assess and review the current foster parentselection criteria and practices as well as government outreach measures toprospective foster parents. Develop fairer and more transparent criteria toensure that all those candidates with a strong commitment and ability to carefor children in their best interests in anatmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding are registered withoutdiscrimination, without excluding couples in common-law marriage and personsnot married, or any other groups of people who are committed and able to carechildren in their best interest. Inappropriate candidates, who are not willingand able to care any children for their best interest, should not be includedin the list. Run a more effective nationwide outreach campaign to encouragequalified candidates from diverse backgrounds to apply for foster parent registration.Set out systems to ensure that localgovernment, experts including but not limited to teachers, counselors, medicaldoctors and lawyers, and community organizations provide the necessary supportand quality monitoring of foster parent placements and the care.To Ensure Adequate Living Standards for Children with DisabilitiesAssign an independent panel of experts includingpeople with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, andrepresentatives of disabled people’s organizations, to review and assessthe situation of children with disabilities in alternative care institutionsand develop comprehensive recommendations for transition of these children to acommunity-based care system, supplemented by special measures needed to assistfoster parents of children with disabilities. The recommendations should makesure that children with disabilities are in the regular school system in thecommunity.Within a planned period of time,de-institutionalize the children living in the short-term therapeuticinstitutions into family-based care in the community and transform theinstitutions into a more accessible community based support mechanism forchildren with disabilities. Make sure that the prefecture or city localgovernment, experts including but not limited to teachers, counselors, medicaldoctors and lawyers, and organizations in the community fully support thefoster parents and the children.Set out systems, such as support groups andexpert advisors, to ensure that local government, experts and disabledpeople’s organizations and parents’ organizations in the communityprovide support to specialized foster parent placements and the care.To Ensure Adequate Temporary Shelter for Children Removed from Biological ParentsIssue policy guidance to child guidance centersto end potentially abusive practices in temporary shelters such as restrictingschool attendance, limiting freedom of movement, unless based on anindividualized assessment that such measures are in the best interests of achild.Develop a transition plan to move allchildren out of child guidance center controlled “temporaryshelter” arrangements after they are removed from their biologicalparents’ care, and into more appropriate, temporary humanitarianplacements that allow the child to interact with other children, continueschool, and live their life with minimal disruption. Solutions could includesystems similar to current temporary protection entrusting children with fosterparents or family in the community.To Improve Care for Children in Alternative Care InstitutionsExtensively revise the conditions of thechild care institutions, such as expanding living space requirements per child orprivate space for each child, to ensure those conditions meet international bestpractice.Undertake frequentinspections—comprising both scheduled and unannounced visits—by thechild guidance centers and other local officials as well as independent thirdparties working for the best interests of the children to check conditions inthe institution. The inspections also check bullying among children. Theseshould involve discussion with, and observation of, the staff and the children.Increase staffing levels in institutions sothat ratios of child care workers to children are in line with internationalbest practice.To Increase Child Participation in Decisions Affecting ThemIssue regulations to require the developmentof an effective external, third-party committee to monitor child careinstitutions at the prefecture level, and provide the committee with resourcesand appropriate personnel to engage with the children in alternativecare.  Ensure the committee has regular, unrestricted access to child carefacilities and develops confidential methods for children to contact thecommittee to relay complaints regarding treatment and conditions. The committeeshould have unfettered access to the foster children as well.Develop other forms of complaint mechanismsto ensure that children can confidentially reach out and seek redress forabuses suffered, and ensure all institutions in the alternative care systemestablished a “zero tolerance” policy regarding any retaliationagainst children raising complaints. Young people with previous care experienceshould be involved in this process, due weight being given to their opinions. Ensurethat these complaint mechanisms are accessible to children with diversedisabilities, including by providing independent support people, if needed.Promote organizations and activities of peergroups of children in alternative care and graduated youth.To Support Independent Living for Older ChildrenEnsure that all children under alternativecare, upon their request, can extend their care arrangements until they are 20years old as an interim measure until such time that appropriate reforms havebeen carried out to support independent living for graduated youth.Provide more financial assistance to supportindependent living, such as tuition assistance and other costs connected toattending high school and college, as well as fees for obtaining adriver’s license.Provide a designated person to consistentlyact as the child’s guarantor for the purpose of securing an apartmentlease, employment contract, and to serve as a guardian for mundane, yetcritical tasks like securing a mobile phone service contract. Come up with effectivemeasures to make sure that issues surrounding parental authority are notobstacles to these contracts. Guarantors should be permitted to serve in thisrole at any occasions if necessary.Develop proper post-care peer supportsystem, including allocating whenever possible, a specialized person who canfacilitate the child’s independence after leaving care.Launch a comprehensive research and analysisproject based on perspectives of youths released from the alternative caresystem. Such a report should consider recommendations for reforming the entirealternative care system.To Support Earthquake-Tsunami OrphansMonitor children for an appropriateperiod—up to 10 years—after the earthquake to make sure that theyall receive all needed care for mental or physical trauma, and receiveappropriate other support as necessary.To Prefectures andOrdinance Designated CitiesTo Ensure that All Children Have an Opportunity to Grow Up in a FamilyFollow the foster parents’ firstpolicy in the national government’s policy guidelines “FosterParents Placement Guidelines”, and make available adequate resources toeffectively implement the principle in line with the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children.Follow the national government’spolicy guidance “Notice on Adoption Administration” that directsdirectors of child guidance centers to try to arrange appropriate adoption forchildren.Whenever biological parents do not agreewith foster care placements, use the authority granted to the child guidance centersunder article 28 of the Child Welfare Act that allows them to place a child infoster parents care with family court permission.To Improve Foster ParentingDevelop a system of more comprehensive andregular trainings, including providing information about care of children, forwould-be foster parents.Ensure foster parents receive ampleinformation required for caring for the child as a foster parent, including thereason for the child entering alternative care, environment(s) where the childhas been in prior to the placement, the history of care for the child, andother related information.Improve the quality of the prospectivefoster parent support and monitoring system, including increasing the expertiseand numbers of people providing support and conducting monitoring.To Ensure Adequate Temporary Shelter Arrangements for Children Removed fromBiological ParentsAssess and review the potentially abusivepractices of temporary shelters for children, including restricting schoolattendance and limiting freedom of movement in the absence of individualizedassessment that such measures are in the child’s best interests.To Ensure Adequate Living Standards in the Community for Children with DisabilitiesRecruit more qualified specialized fosterparents to care and assist children with disabilities, and ensure that theyreceive appropriate training and support to undertake such care.To Increase Child Participation in Decisions Affecting ThemUndertake a range of measures to improve children’sparticipation in the alternative child care system, including but not limitedto:Significantly improving distribution of the Children’sRights Guidebook, including ensuring its contents are properly communicatedto the children, and effective avenues are created for implementing andfollowing-up on the provisions contained in the guidebook. Standardizedcurriculums and regular courses should instruct staff on using the guidebook.The guidebook should include postcards to allow children to reach the child guidancecenter and other third parties free of charge, as well as provide toll-freephone numbers and email address.Listen to and appropriately take intoaccount children’s opinions when making decisions about the alternativecare arrangements and institution/foster home where they reside. Developpractical steps to promote such consultation in a more effective manner.Encourage regular interactions between theresponsible individuals or committee members outside of the institutions whooversee the institution and the children.To Improve Support for Independent Living Arrangements for Graduated Youth WhoHave Left Alternative CareInstruct each child guidance center to designatea specialized person, and provide that person with appropriate resources andauthority, to serve as a liaison to children who have left alternative care andsupport them with independent living arrangements. Each child guidance center shouldalso modify schedules, programs and routines for children in the institutionsto help them gradually yet consistently prepare to live independently.AcknowledgementsSayo Saruta, consultant for the Asia division of HumanRights Watch; Kanae Doi, Japan director; and Bede Sheppard, deputy childrenrights director researched this report.

However, there is no dataabout how many new children entered in group homes for independent living.However, accurately determining the actual overall number of children newlyentering the alternative child care system each year is difficult becausechildren who enter institutions from other child care institution and otherfoster homes are included in government statistics. Human Rights Watch phone interviewwith an official of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, November 26,2013.

There are various reasons for such long-stays, including thefollowing: some child care institutions did not accept children withdevelopmental disabilities; some parents gave their consent for placement oftheir child, but then withdrew it later, and then continued this cycle ofconsent and withdrawal of consent; the child guidance center thought thearticle 28 process under the Child Welfare Act (by which the center seeks acourt order when biological parents seek to block a transfer to alternativecare) took a long time and hesitated to use it, but then found that getting consentfrom the birth parents actually took longer time; the child guidance center didnot use the article 28 process because they did not have confidence that the familycourt would authorize the placement.

Please be informedthat this number shows only how many institutions have which  size ofresidence. For example, when one institution has seven units each with eightchildren and two units each with thirteen children in its premise, this datacounts twice, one for “small-sized-institution” and one for “middle-sizedinstitution.”[31]Phone interview with officer in the Family WelfareDivision, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, November 5, 2013.[32]As of 2013, monthly general living expense covered by the government is 54,980yen ($550) for an infant, and 47,680 yen ($480) for others. Foster parents alsoreceive additional funds for educational expenses, preparation for a job orhigher education, and medical services.[33]Furthermore, there are also many cases in which thosewho are certified as specialized foster parents serve simply as registeredfoster parents.

There isa huge gap between the overall number of specialized foster parents and thenumber of specialized foster parents successfully matched with a child. This isbecause some specialized foster parents receive children in the status of registeredfoster parents, not as specialized foster parents, but are still countedbureaucratically as “specialized foster parents without any childplacement.” The disparity also results because some specialized fosterparents run family homes and are not counted as specialized foster parents matchedwith children.[34]The number of children placed in foster parent’scare does not match up the number of foster parents receiving a foster child,which seems to be a statistical error. The Ministry of Health, Labour andWelfare responded to an inquiry from Human Rights Watch regarding this issue,by admitting that they were aware of the statistical errors which were thoughtto be caused by duplicate calculations of the same foster parents who areregistered in multiple categories. However, the ministry was unable to provideany further clear reasoning or explanation on this issue.[35]Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare,“Reference Material: Current State of Alternative Care” (“社会的養護の現状について [参考資料]”), March 2013,http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/kodomo/syakaiteki_yougo/dl/yougo_genjou_01.pdf(accessed March 1, 2014), p. 86.[36]Human Rights Watch raised the question with officialsof the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare about why persons would registerwith the Child Guidance Center as kinship-based foster parents and then nothave a child who is their relative placed with them.

Therefore,this form of care is typically considered to be a type of the foster parentcare system in Japan and, in principle, treated equally as foster parents. Theterm “foster parent” used in this report includes foster familygroup home facilities unless noted otherwise. However, some argue thatnurturing six children at once, even if it were under single residential setting,may not be exactly the same as what we call “foster parent’scare.” Human Rights Watch interview with Tadami Takahashi, president ofIwate foster parent association, Iwate, May 17, 2012.[38] Equal Employment, Children and Families Bureau,Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, “Notice on Foster ParentPlacement Guidelines” (“里親委託ガイドラインについて”), in Foster Parent Placement Guidelines (里親委託ガイドライン), Issue 0330, No.9, March 30, http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/shingi/2r98520000018h6g-att/2r98520000018hlp.pdf (accessed July 26, 2013).[39] Thesecertification requirements for foster parents vary among prefectures andcities. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government, for example, sets out requirements includingthose related to residential conditions which demand that “appropriatespace be available according to the family structure with at least two roomsmaking up 10 tatami mat space (approximately 16.5 square meters) or larger inprinciple,” as well as income standards which require “a totalincome of the household exceeding the welfare standards in principle,”meaning the individual or family must earn more than the amount that wouldqualify them for public welfare assistance. The Tokyo Metropolitan Governmentalso   sets out a requirement that if the foster parent candidatedoes not have a partner, he or she must be recognized as able to provideadequate care for the child solo. If no issues are raised through this process,the candidate will then be certified as a foster parent and registered.

According to Masao Tamai, the traits of developmental disorders(i.e. pervasive developmental disorder, LD, ADHD) could induce abuse at times,but there is no causal relationship in abuse leading to developmentaldisorders.
