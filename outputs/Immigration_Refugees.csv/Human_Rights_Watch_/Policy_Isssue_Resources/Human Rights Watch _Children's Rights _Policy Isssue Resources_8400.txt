[t]hey'd have rug burns allover their bodies. . . . They hold your arms back and they purposefully pushyour face in the rug. They have their knee in your back and your arms all theway back. I've been restrained before so I know.-Stephanie Q., incarcerated at age 16There's only one teacher, but everyone's in a differentplace, so it's not good. They try to give you a book and tell you to study outof it.-Alicia K., incarcerated at age 15I asked to talk to the ombudsman probably every day. They[facilities staff] said, "OK," but it never happened. It's my right to call butthey wouldn't let me talk to him. Or the other thing they'd say is "Tell mewhat you're going to tell him."-Felicia H., incarcerated at age 17There is growing recognition that people incarcerated in U.S.jails and prisons often suffer from abusive treatment and neglect. When thoseabused are children who have been placed in juvenile facilities ostensibly fortheir rehabilitation, public concern is justifiably heightened. Media storiesand public debate about troubled children tend to focus on the delinquentbehaviors of and state responses to boys. However, an increasing proportion ofthe children being put behind bars are girls. In New YorkState, the proportion of girls takeninto custody has grown from 14 percent in 1994 to over 18 percent in 2004.This report focuses on the two large, prison-like facilitiesin which girls in New Yorkstate are confined, namely, the Tryon and Lansing facilities, and concludesthat, far too often, girls experience abusive physical restraints and other formsof abuse and neglect, and are denied the mental health, educational, and otherrehabilitative services they need. Because of the facilities' remote locations,confined girls are isolated from their families and communities.The New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS)is the state agency whose Department of Rehabilitative Services administersjuvenile facilities. Although OCFS ischargedwith rehabilitating children over whom it takes custody, it often fails toserve, and even to protect, confined girls, and this failure continues becausethere is little or no meaningful oversight of conditions in OCFS facilities. Thislast point is critical. Internal monitoring and oversight of the facility are,to put it charitably, dysfunctional, and independent outside monitoring is allbut nonexistent. As a result, the conditions in the Tryon and Lansingfacilities addressed in this report are shrouded in secrecy and girls whosuffer abuse have little meaningful redress.Human Rights Watch investigates conditions in juvenilefacilities in the UnitedStates and around the world and we havefound OCFS to be among the most hostile juvenile justice agencies we have everencountered. Despite repeated formal and informal requests over a period ofseveral months, we were denied access to the facilities themselves. Workingthrough channels independent of OCFS, Human Rights Watch and the ACLU(HRW/ACLU) made contact with children, family members, and others with relevantfirsthand experiences and knowledge. Ultimately we were able to speak with only30 formerly incarcerated girls directly, but what we found, as detailed below,is serious cause for concern: the state of New York is failing to watch over OCFS, andOCFS is failing the girls in its custody.The majority of girls in Tryon and Lansing are fifteen orsixteen years old, although some are as young as twelve. As with incarceratedpersons throughout the U.S.,a disproportionate number of girls confined in New York are African-Americans from familieswho have lived in poverty for generations, with parents or other closerelatives who themselves have been incarcerated. In many cases, these girlsfall into juvenile facilities through vast holes in the social safety net,after child welfare institutions and schools have failed them. In the wake oflegal reform in 1996, girls who commit "status offenses" such as disobedienceand running away from home are no longer supposed to be placed in custody, butsuch offenses-and the related issue of involvement with child welfare agenciesbecause of parental abuse and neglect-continue to function as gateways throughwhich particularly vulnerable children are drawn into the juvenile justicesystem.Of course, the immediate cause of a girl's incarceration inthe Lansing or Tryon facilities is her commission of a delinquent act, that is,an act that would be a criminal offense if committed by an adult. Such actsinclude assault, occurring in many cases during family or peer altercations,theft offenses including shoplifting, and other crimes. A judge ordering a girlto be placed in a specific type of facility signals his or her expectation thatthe girl will be confined at a particular level of security and provided withappropriate, specified services. Unfortunately, conditions in the facilities oftenare markedly different from what many judges envision. In reality, all girls sentto Tryon or Lansingare confined in a prison-like physical environment where they may be at risk ofabuse and where promised services are often not delivered.One of the most troubling abuses is the use of inappropriateand excessive force by facilities staff against girls. By interviewing formerlyincarcerated girls and examining agency documents, HRW/ACLU have documented theexcessive use of a forcible face-down "restraint" procedure intended foremergencies but in fact used far more often. In a restraint, staff seize a girlfrom behind and, in a face-down posture, push her head and entire body to thefloor. They then pull her arms up behind her and hold or handcuff them. Wefound that the procedure is used against girls as young as 12 and that itfrequently results in facial abrasions and other injuries, and even brokenlimbs.According to human rights standards, physical force may beused against confined children only as an emergency measure to control aviolent or self-destructive child and only when all other means of control havefailed. Physical force is never acceptable as punishment, yet that is exactlyhow force sometimes appears to be used at Lansing and Tryon. Many girls told HRW/ACLUthat the face-down restraint procedure at times was used punitively for minorof failings by girls, including, in the most egregious cases, improperly makingtheir beds or not raising their hands before speaking.Girls confined in Tryon and Lansing are also at riskof a range of sexually abusive behaviors. HRW/ACLU documented three specificcases over the past five years of staff having sexual intercourse with girls. Sexualabuse short of intercourse also occurs in the facilities, ranging from verbalinnuendo, to observation of girls in states of undress by male staff, tounwanted touching. Girls also report that staff make publicly humiliatingcomments revealing girls' past sexual history, or experience of abuse, or amedical condition such as infection with a sexually transmitted disease.Lesbians as well as girls who do not conform to staff stereotypes of girlishbehavior are sometimes harassed by staff and other girls.Girls incarcerated at the Tryon and Lansing facilities arealso subjected to security measures beyond what appears to be strictly necessaryand in some cases contrary to OCFS's own official categorizations. Thefacilities examined in this report are designated by OCFS as "secure" (one partof Tryon, referred to as Tryon Secure), "limited secure" (Lansing), and "non-secure" (another part of Tryon,referred to as Tryon Girls). According to OCFS, girls sent to the "non-secure"portion of Tryon "do not require the more restrictive setting of a limitedsecure facility." Yet both the "secure" and "non-secure" portions of Tryonconsist of barracks-like units surrounded by layers of razor wire. Girls'activities are tightly controlled and their interaction with each other islimited. In fact, there is little discernible difference between Tryon's "secure"and "non-secure" units.Throughout Tryon and Lansing, all girls are bound in somecombination of handcuffs, leg-shackles, and leather restraint belts any timethey leave the facility. Girls are also subject to frequent strip-searches inwhich they must undress in front of a staff person and submit to a thoroughvisual inspection including their genitals. All correctional systems must takeappropriate precautions to maintain security and to ensure that weapons, drugs,or other contraband are not smuggled by transported prisoners. Nevertheless,these measures should be reasonable, proportionate, and objectively justified. Themeasures taken by OCFS are hard to justify as legitimate or reasonable securitymeasures for children, many of whom have been found by judges to require a"non-secure" environment.Tryon and Lansing provide haphazard and insufficienteducational and vocational opportunities for girls. When a girl is ordered to ajuvenile facility, she is discharged from her public school and the facilitybecomes responsible for ensuring one of her most basic and important rights-theright to an education. Classes held at Lansing and Tryon combine girls ofvarying educational levels and needs, and are insufficiently staffed withqualified teachers. Girls are therefore either intellectually understimulatedor overwhelmed, and girls complain that the facilities' main aim seems to bepreparing them to take the General Equivalency Diploma exam, rather thanhelping them achieve a high school diploma. Both OCFS and the schoolsthemselves fail to ensure that girls leaving facilities are properly placedback in public schools. The lack of reentry assistance provided to girls andpoor coordination between facilities and schools likely contributes to thetroubling fact that two-thirds of high school aged boys and girls leavingjuvenile facilities do not re-enter regular public high schools.When vocational training is available at all, that offeredto girls is limited to stereotypically female pursuits such as culinary arts,cosmetology, and clerical skills. By contrast, comparable boys' facilitiesoffer a range of vocational classes providing marketable skills and nationallyrecognized certifications. These educational failings can amount to a cripplingfuture disadvantage for incarcerated girls, exacerbating the pattern ofintergenerational educational and economic marginalization suffered by many ofthe girls and their families.In New Yorkin 2004, of the children screened by OCFS for special needs when taken intocustody, 48 percent had physical health needs, 52 percent had mental healthneeds, and 77 percent had substance abuse problems. Sixty-nine percent ofscreened children had multiple special needs. OCFS documents and the statementsof administrators reveal that staff are aware of and concerned about the healthneeds of incarcerated girls. Serious failings remain nevertheless, especiallywhere mental health services are concerned. Many incarcerated girls physicallyharm themselves and even attempt suicide, to which facilities' staff frequentlyrespond with punishment in addition to treatment. Mental health counseling byprofessionally trained staff is largely inadequate, and much "counseling" isinstead provided by ordinary line staff without credentials or training inpsychotherapeutic treatment.Judges, attorneys, family members, and friends ofincarcerated girls have little chance of learning exactly how girls in OCFS facilitiesare treated, not least because Tryon and Lansing are located hundreds of milesaway from New York City,the place most incarcerated girls call home, and because girls' access to meansof communication is strictly limited. Girls are cut off from the outside worldin other ways too. Once a girl is placed in an OCFS facility, she loses thestate-funded lawyer who represented her in court, unless an appeal or otherpost-adjudication legal proceeding is underway.Girls incarcerated in NewYork's juvenile system who wish to seek redress forinfringements on their rights have few options. In most cases, the only placeto which they can turn is the same facility and at times the very same staff membersresponsible for the wrongs about which they are complaining. Girls' primarymeans of drawing attention to problems they experience within a facility is thefiling of written grievances. All of the girls HRW/ACLU interviewed said theyfound the grievance process frustrating and ineffective, most commonly becausetheir grievances were ignored. Thus hidden from public scrutiny and without aneffective mechanism for seeking redress, girls in Tryon and Lansing continue toendure harmful treatment and neglect.One important reason that the abusive treatment and otherproblems described in this report continue is the absence of genuinely independentoversight of the Tryon and Lansing juvenile facilities. Combined with thefacilities' isolated rural location and restrictions on incarcerated children'scontact with the outside world, the facilities operate in an informationalvacuum. Inadequate funding for existing monitors, such as the facilitiesombudsman, as well as OCFS's failure to maintain a functioning IndependentReview Board as required by law, are partly to blame. The ombudsman's office isalso weak because it is part of OCFS, answerable to and physically locatedwithin OCFS headquarters. New York'sChild Protective Services (CPS) is likewise a sub-part of OCFS and itsexistence is not known to many incarcerated girls. Another established monitor,New York'sOffice of the Inspector General, does not provide the necessary oversightbecause OCFS represents only a small piece of its broad mandate, and because itconducts no regular monitoring visits to OCFS's locked facilities. Althoughjudges, legislators, and other state officials have the power under state lawto visit the facilities at will, this power is rarely if ever invoked. Inresponse to efforts by outside investigators to gather information on how OCFSruns its juvenile facilities, the agency's leadership has proven itself secretiveand adverse to scrutiny, effectively leaving the public in the dark. Withinthis institutional scheme, children are left to fend for themselves.The "key recommendations" below highlight immediate steps webelieve OCFS and other state authorities must take to stop some of the mostegregious abuses documented in this report. We then provide detailedrecommendations for the state and local authorities with responsibilitiesaffecting the conditions under which girls are incarcerated in New YorkState. Change is essential since girls'near total isolation from outside eyes and ears allows abuses to continueundetected and without remedy.RecommendationsKey RecommendationsA number of problems in New York's girls' juvenile facilities urgentlyrequire correction. To end its dangerous overuse and misuse of the forcibleface-down restraint technique, OCFS must bring its internal policies intocompliance with domestic and international law by revising them to permit thephysical restraint of children only as an option of last resort in genuineemergencies. OCFS must take immediate and vigorous measures to implement thisnarrower policy through thorough re-training of all facilities administratorsand staff. Facilities employees who use excessive force should be punished. Inaddition, OCFS should make it a priority to develop safer techniques ofemergency control.The absence of meaningful oversight of OCFS facilities must alsobe addressed. At a minimum, OCFS should ensure that the Ombudsman's office is sufficientlywell staffed to carry out its legally mandated functions, constitute afunctioning Independent Review Board (IRB) staffed as required by stateregulations, and open its doors to outside monitors.Those with immediate authority over NewYork's juvenile justice system, the Governor and OCFS Commissioner,should be held accountable for seeing that these reforms are implemented andfor ensuring that conditions for all children confined in New York meet international, national, andstate standards of safety, health, and dignity. To date, they have failed to doso.We believe that the foregoing immediate changes are necessaryto mitigate the most dangerous conditions in OCFS facilities. More fundamentalinstitutional changes-requiring action by the New York State Legislature inaddition to the Governor and OCFS Commissioner-need to be made, however, forsignificant improvements in girls' and boys' conditions of confinement to occur.First, Human Rights Watch and the ACLU urge passage of Assembly Bill 6334/SenateBill 6877, creating an independent state Office of the Child Advocate tooversee all juvenile justice and foster care facilities. While internaloversight in the form of a functioning and fully staffed ombudsman's office andIRB may help remedy some of the most urgent abuses, external, independentmonitoring is crucial to ensure the fair and humane treatment of New York's mostvulnerable children. Second, as an overarching goal, the Governor, OCFS, andthe State Legislature should work diligently toward a system in which few ifany children are held in prison-like environments but instead receive the helpthey need in their homes and communities.DetailedRecommendationsTo theGovernor of New York and the Commissioner of the Office ofChildren and Family Services (OCFS)System-wide Structural ReformReduce the use of large, remote, prison-like facilities tothe greatest extent possible, realizing that rehabilitation and communitysafety are in almost all cases best served by more humane, effective, andeconomical home- or community-based care programs.oExpand the ability of juvenile courts to keep children intheir homes and to shorten periods of incarceration by vastly expanding theexisting "Evidence-based Community Initiative" (EbCI).oPhase out prison-like facilities in favor of small, home-like,post-adjudication facilities located close to children's communities andemploying a rehabilitative philosophy.So long as juvenile facilities continue to operate, reviewall policies and procedures to ensure that each genuinely contributes to thegoal of rehabilitation.Ensure that policies and practices affecting girls servetheir needs and do not reflect outdated stereotypes. At the very least, girlsshould always receive care, protection, assistance, treatment, education, andtraining on par with what is given to boys.Elimination ofDangerous and Excessively Punitive PracticesImmediately bring OCFS use of force policy into compliance withnational and international standards regarding the use of force againstchildren by replacing the existing broad grounds for use of physical restraintswith the widely accepted standard of permitting force only when a child posesan imminent threat of injury to self or others and all other means of controlhave been exhausted. Train all facilities staff as to these standards andpunish staff who use excessive force against children.Collect and make publicly available cumulative statisticaldata on the use of restraints in each OCFS facility.Diligently explore alternative means of emergencyintervention.Discontinue the use of mechanical restraints on childrenexcept when strictly necessary and as a last resort.Never use physical, mechanical, or medical restraints asmeans of punishment.Ensure that conditions in "non-secure" facilities aremeaningfully less restrictive and prison-like than those in secure facilities.Discontinue the practices ofstrip-searching children except when absolutely necessary for reasons of safetyand security.Improve staff recruitment, screening, training, andsupervision with the goal of curtailing violence and degrading treatment of allkinds and promoting the formation of nurturing, non-exploitative relationshipsbetween staff and girls in which the girls' needs and safety are paramount.Elimination ofSexual Abuse against Confined GirlsStrictly enforce policies prohibiting sexualcontact, harassment, or abuse of children.Strictly limit the use of male staff in girls'living quarters.Upon receiving an allegation of sexualmisconduct, immediately suspend the implicated staff member pendinginvestigation.Conductthorough internal investigations of all complaints of abuse, refer all suchcomplaints to Child Protective Services and the New York State Inspector General,and impose appropriate punishment on staff members found guilty of misconduct.Girls' Physicaland Mental HealthEnsure staffing by an appropriate number of mental healthprofessionals to provide mental health services to confined girls, and ensurethat everyone providing counseling has sufficient qualifications.Ensure that procedures are in place to provide prompt andconsistent access to physical and mental health care to all confined children,and ensure that nonmedical staff do not interfere with access to care.Respond toself-cutting and other forms of self-harm, which signal psychological needs,with appropriate mental health services. Stop punishing girls for acts ofself-harm.Strictly implement policies prohibiting the disclosure ofconfidential personal, medical, and other information by staff to anyone notauthorized to receive such information. Impose discipline on staff members whoviolate children's right to privacy.Offer quality productive and recreational activitiesthroughout the day, including on weekends, to drastically reduce the degree ofisolation and idleness experienced by confined children. Girls should not beleft idle or left in their rooms for extended periods, which is currently asignificant problem especially on weekends.NondiscriminationAdopt and enforce explicitpolicies prohibiting discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, andtransgendered (LGBT) children, and children who do not conform to genderstereotypes. Include such policies in allpolicy and training manuals. Report and record incidentsof discrimination based on sexual orientation or any other basis, such as raceor religion, by staff or girls.Provide high qualitytraining to all OCFS staff and administrators in how to relate to LGBT andgender non-conforming children with sensitivity and support.Education and SocialDevelopmentIncrease the number of teaching staff in each facility andensure that each teacher is property trained and qualified as a means ofproviding all incarcerated children, especially those with special educationalneeds, with quality schooling meeting their individual needs. OCFS educationalprograms should also strive for continuity of education, facilitatingchildren's reentry into public schools at the same grade level they would haveoccupied had they remained in public school.Consistentlyprovide vocational training of a quality and variety meeting the needs of girlswhen they leave facilities and enter the work force. At a minimum, providegirls with vocational opportunities on a par with that offered to boys. Conductresearch to determine the career fields most likely to offer stable, lucrativeemployment for girls following their release.Consistently provide adequate writing materials and a fullstock of art supplies to permit incarcerated girls modes of self-expression.Respect the privacy of girls' journals and other possessions.Foster peer support through social activity among girls. Ensurethat any restrictions on peer interaction are reasonable and are designed and enforcedwith an eye toward rehabilitation, especially at TryonReceptionCenter, where socialisolation is the most severe.Access toFamiliesImprove family members' access to facilities in remotelocations by creating shuttle-bus services, transportation reimbursement, orother means.Increase opportunities for children to maintain contactwith family members, such as increasing visiting hours and permitting childrenmore frequent and longer telephone calls home.ReentryFor eachincarcerated child, regardless of age, establish a comprehensive reentry plancreated with the child's participation and tailored to her individual needs andabilities. Where possible, work with the child's family to facilitate positivefamily reunification.As to eachchild who is under 21 and has not earned a high school diploma or GED at thetime of her release, make all necessary arrangements to reenroll her in schoolprior to her release.At reentry,provide each child who cannot return to her family with a foster placement oranother form of transitional housing.EnsuringAppropriate StaffingImmediately fill youth aide, youth counselor, and educationalvacancies to ameliorate the severe, chronic shortage of staff.Increase staff levels so that each employee has a manageableworkload, can attend mandated trainings, and need not regularly work overtime.Provide counseling, mentoring, and other training mechanismsfor line staff and administrators to help them better respond to the demandsand stresses of the uniquely difficult environment within facilities.Review required qualifications and credentials for line staffand counselors working directly with children. If higher qualifications arecalled for, revise salary levels to attract better qualified staff.Transparency andAccountabilityComply with existing state regulations providing for areasonably independentand functional ombudsman's office. The ombudsman's office should be physicallylocated outside of OCFS headquarters, and should to the greatest extent possiblebe independent from OCFS administratively and substantively. The ombudsman'soffice should be allocated sufficient funding and staff to perform itsfunctions in a meaningful way, including making frequent in-person visits toeach facility.Ensure unimpeded access between the ombudsman andincarcerated children via telephone and post. To this end, prominently displayinformation regarding the ombudsman's office in each unit of every facility,including information on children's right to contact the ombudsman and contactinformation for the ombudsman's office. Consider establishing a hotline and/ora locked box in which children may deposit messages forwarded directly to theombudsman.Reestablishthe statutorily mandated Independent Review Board, comply with legalrequirements as to the number and qualifications of its members, and ensurethat it meets regularly, inspects OCFS facilities, and carries out all of itsenumerated functions.Ensurecompliance with internationalstandards calling for regular inspections and other meansof control of facilities by independent monitors. Such monitoring should be frequent,regular, unannounced, and unrestricted.Ensure that the grievance system operates so that each andevery filed grievance is responded to promptly, fairly, and in sufficientdetail.Establish systematic data gathering for key indicators ofchildren's welfare and facilities' performance, including data regarding thehistory, placement, and post-release success of children referred to OCFS. Thisdata should be gender-, race-, and ethnicity-disaggregated. In particular,collect and disseminate comparative data on the recidivism rates of childrenremanded to OCFS facilities and those participating in the Evidence-basedCommunity Initiative (EbCI).Make all non-confidential data collected by OCFS freelyavailable to the public as a measure of accountability and to counteract theinvisibility of girls in the system.Conduct and publish a comprehensive annual survey of allincarcerated girls to discover problem areas and shortcomings in facilities.To the New YorkState LegislatureAction on Pending BillsAdopt Bill A.6334/S.6877, creating an independent Office ofthe Child Advocate to oversee all juvenile justice and foster care facilities. TheChild Advocate would have capacity beyond that of the ombudsman and completeindependence from OCFS, allowing impartial, comprehensive review and analysisof OCFS's performance. Ensure sufficient allocation of funds permitting theOffice to function effectively.Adopt Bill A.6502, also known as the SAFETY (Safe, Fair andEqual Treatment for Youth) Act, prohibiting discrimination and harassment inOCFS facilities based on sexual orientation, gender, and gender identity, aswell as race, national origin, ethnicity, religion and disability, andrequiring OCFS to train staff to respond appropriately to incidents ofdiscrimination and harassment.Adopt Bill A.6597/S.4423, also known as the SafeHarborfor Exploited Children Act, creating community based programs forprostitution-involved children who are currently incarcerated. In addition,adopt legislation recognizing that children's legal inability to consent to sexshould preclude the arrest of commercially sexually exploited children forprostitution.Other ActionEncourageeach assembly member to conduct unannounced visits to OCFS facilities wheneverpossible, particularly those in remote locations, as authorized by section 519of the Executive Law.To the NewYorkCourtsReferchildren to prison-like OCFS facilities only as a measure of last resort, whenthere are no alternatives consistent with the child's well-being.As to children referred to OCFS, order whenever possible the provision ofservices through the "Evidence-based Community Initiative" (EbCI) orother home- or community-based programs as an alternative to incarceration.Issue a detailedorder assuring proper individualized treatment and services for each adjudicatedchild. Ensure that OCFS fully complies with all provisions in court orders andconsistently provides high-quality services to referred children.Other ActionEncourage each judge and eligible court officerto conduct unannounced visits to OCFS facilities whenever possible,particularly those in remote locations, as authorized by section 519 ofthe Executive Law.To Family Court Prosecutors, Mental Health ServicesOfficers, and Probation OfficersRecommendconfinement of children in prison-like OCFS facilities only as a measure oflast resort, when there are no alternatives consistent with the child's well-being.As to those children referred to OCFS, recommend wheneverpossible the provision of services through the "Evidence-based CommunityInitiative" (EbCI) or other home- or community-based programs as an alternativeto incarceration.In all cases, ensure that judges are presented withinformation concerning effective community-based options they can consider inlieu of incarceration.To the New YorkState Office of Mental HealthDramatically increase the number of qualified mental healthcare staff available at OCFS facilities, both for youth and staff. Ensure theexistence of programs for girls addressing physical and sexual abuse and othervictimization.Regularly review the quality of mental health care providedin juvenile facilities. Pay particular attention to the quality and quantity ofindividual and group therapy provided and the appropriateness of prescribed medication.To the New York State Department of EducationRegularly monitor OCFS educational facilities to assure compliancewith all federal and state educational standards.Implement a memorandum of understanding and a cooperativerelationship with OCFS to assure automatic transfer of credits from OCFSschools to New Yorkpublic schools. This should include developing syllabi for classes offeredin OCFS and making any other recommendations necessary to bring the twoeducational systems into harmony.To the New YorkState Civil Service Employees Association and PublicEmployees Federation, the unions representing OCFS facilities staffSupport the immediate abandonment of OCFS's current overbroad useof force policy, which causes needless injury to confined children as wellas staff, in favor of a far narrower policy permitting the use of forceonly as a last resort in genuine crises.Help transform OCFS facilities into humane working environments forstaff as well as safe living environments for girls by supporting keyreforms such as ample staffing and improved staff hiring, training, andsupervision.Support broad-based reforms such as movement toward lessprison-like facilities and procedures, in-depth monitoring of facilitiesconditions by internal and external observers, and legislative reformsmaking OCFS facilities safer, fairer, and more humane.To the United States Department of Justice, Special LitigationSectionInvestigate the conditions of confinement of girls in New York commitmentfacilities. An investigation is particularly warranted in this case notonly because of the nature of the complaints HRW/ACLU has received but alsobecause OCFS currently lacks its own adequate investigatory mechanisms and impedesfull investigation by outside monitors.To the UnitedStates State DepartmentExtend an invitation to the United Nations Special Rapporteuron Violence Against Women to investigate the conditions of confinement of girlsin New Yorkcommitment facilities.To the United StatesCongressTo Both HousesAmend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act toenforce the equitable treatment of boys and girls, and ensure thatgender-specific services are provided to girls. Require states to gatherand provide recidivism rates and other data demonstrating the success of their treatment, educational,and other programming.To the SenateConsent to ratification of the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child.To the President of the United StatesRatify the Convention on the Rights of theChild once the Senate has given its advice and consent.To the United Nations Special Rapporteur onViolence Against WomenInvestigate the conditions of confinement of girls in New York's juvenilefacilities, whether alone or in conjunction with other United Nationschildren's rights and women's rights expertsMethodsThis report, a joint effort by Human Rights Watch andthe American Civil Liberties Union ("HRW/ACLU"), is the second report issuedunder the Aryeh Neier Fellowship Program.[1]It is one of a series published by Human Rights Watch on the conditions ofconfinement of children. In the United States, Human Rights Watch has investigatedand reported on juvenile correctional facilities in California, Colorado,Georgia, Louisiana, and Maryland, and has published two reports on detention conditionsfor unaccompanied immigrant children. Outside the U.S.,Human Rights Watch has documented conditions of children's incarceration in Bulgaria, Guatemala,Egypt, India, Jamaica,Kenya, Pakistan, PapuaNew Guinea, and Brazil. This is the first HumanRights Watch report to focus specifically on the conditions faced byincarcerated girls. New York was chosen as thefocus of this report because its juvenile justice system is a large one, withmany girls affected by the problems identified, yet the patterns apparent in New York are replicated elsewhere in the United States.Whenconducting research for this report, HRW/ACLU faced significant resistance fromOCFS. Officials at OCFS repeatedly denied HRW/ACLU researchers access to theLansing and Tryon facilities and permission to interview incarcerated girls,employing tactics of delay and misdirection over a period of approximatelyeight months.[2] OCFS also acted to frustrate and delay requests to obtain agencydocuments. In reacting to a request filed under New York's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL),OCFS delayed responding for months, claiming repeatedly that the request wouldresult in thousands of pages of disclosure, but ultimately produced fewer than300 pages of responsive documents and denied the remainder of the request. Onlyupon successfully appealing OCFS's denial did HRW/ACLU gain access toapproximately 600 additional pages of documents containing summaries of thousandsof complaints by incarcerated girls. These grievance logs, maintained by eachfacility, contain one- to two-sentence summaries of grievances filed byconfined girls regarding various aspects of facilities conditions. HRW/ACLUanalyzed 4924 of these entries, recorded over a three-year period in eachfacility.[3]HRW/ACLU also submitted two subsequent FOIL requests, in response to which OCFSproduced approximately 6,000 pages of documents in compliance with its legalduty but only after protracted delay, and subject to a number of apparentlyunwarranted redactions, inexplicably missing pages, and denials of certainspecific requests.OCFSalso refused repeated requests by HRW/ACLU for permission to interview OCFSadministrators and staff. In April 2006, after months of negotiation and theintervention of concerned state legislators, HRW/ACLU was granted a singlemeeting with the Commissioner of OCFS and certain OCFS administrators. Thatmeeting lasted for about one hour and yielded very little concrete information.HRW/ACLU's repeated attempts to contact several individual OCFS employees toobtain their perspectives on concerns raised in this report were largelyrebuffed or ignored. The viewpoints of the few individual OCFS employees whoagreed to speak with HRW/ACLU, as well as some opinions expressed by seniorstaff during the April 2006 meeting, are reflected in this report. Most OCFSstaff contacted by HRW/ACLU refused to be interviewed, and several calls byHRW/ACLU were returned instead by staff of the OCFS Office of Public Affairsinsisting that HRW/ACLU cease contacting OCFS employees and instead direct itscommunications to the public relations office alone. Questions directed to thepublic relations office have gone unanswered.HRW/ACLUultimately conducted interviews with thirty girls who had previously beenincarcerated in New YorkState, and correspondedby mail with two girls still in confinement.[4] In addition, HRW/ACLU obtainedtranscripts of interviews conducted with two formerly incarcerated girls by theCorrectional Association of New York in July 2004, as well as unpublishedreports produced by the Legal Aid Society in New York City following visits to severalOCFS facilities between 1999 and 2005.Aswhen working with other vulnerable individuals, HRW/ACLU takes particular careto ensure that interviews of children are confidential, conducted withsensitivity, and free from any actual or apparent outside influence. HRW/ACLU doesnot print the names or other identifying information of interviewed children.In this report, all children are identified by aliases to protect theirprivacy. In addition to the interviews with girls, which form the heart of thisreport, HRW/ACLU interviewed other knowledgeable individuals such asdelinquency attorneys, social service providers, and academic experts. Becausemany child welfare agencies depend on state funding, several of the adultsinterviewed asked that their names and positions not be published so as toavoid jeopardizing their organizations' funding.HRW/ACLUsolicited interviews with all formerly incarcerated girls whom it identified andconducted interviews with all who consented to be interviewed. As reflected inthis report, the interviewed girls expressed a wide range of opinions about theconditions in OCFS facilities. Yet there was striking consensus among girls,though incarcerated in different facilities at different times and interviewedindividually, as to certain concerns, notably the misuse and overuse of theforcible face-down restraint technique, the hopeless state of the grievanceprocess, and the near impossibility for New York City children of maintainingmeaningful contact with families from facilities located deep in rural upstateNew York. Other concerns, such as discrimination, educational deficiencies, andcomplications with reentry into communities were raised by some girls but notby others.I. The Rights of Incarcerated Girls under InternationalLawThisreport assesses the treatment of children according to international standards setforth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[5] the International Covenanton Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights,[6] the Convention against Tortureand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,[7] the Convention on theRights of the Child,[8] the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,[9] the U.N. Standard MinimumRules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice,[10] the U.N. Rules for theProtection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty,[11] the U.N. Guidelines for thePrevention of Juvenile Delinquency,[12] and the U.N. StandardMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.[13]Inrelation to the protection of the rights of children confined in a correctionalfacility, it is important to note that,with the exception of the right to liberty, children continue to enjoyin general all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under humanrights law. An incarcerated girl does not forfeit her rights merely because ofher confinement, or because she has fallen afoul of the justice system.Imprisonment, the deprivation of liberty, is the punishment. The conditions ofimprisonment and the regime to which a girl is subject should not, therefore,except as incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance ofdiscipline, aggravate the suffering inherent in imprisonment. Any restrictionson girls' human rights that are a consequence of their imprisonment must bejustified, for example, on well founded considerations related to security.TheInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is one of the corehuman rights instruments providing for the protection of basic civil andpolitical rights. The ICCPR also prescribes the rights due those who face criminal charges or confinement.Relevant provisions include the prohibition on arbitrary detention,[14] a guarantee of due process,[15] a right to be treated withdignity[16] and a strict prohibitionagainst egregious violations of fundamental rights, most notably theprohibition of torture and any form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.[17] In 1992, the United Statesratified the ICCPR. As a ratified international treaty, the ICCPR is not onlybinding on the U.S.as a matter of international law,[18] but it also constitutes"the supreme Law of the Land" pursuant to Article 6 section 2 of the UnitedStates Constitution, and "the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby."[19]Severalfundamental provisions of the ICCPR are directly relevant to the treatment ofincarcerated girls. Article 24 proclaims that all minors are subject to specialtreatment without regard to gender or other status.[20]The jurisprudence of the Human RightsCommittee, which oversees States' compliance with the ICCPR, affirms that thisoutlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation.[21] Article 10 provides thatincarcerated juveniles must be kept separate from adults, and that the aim ofdetention shall be rehabilitation.[22] Finally, articles 17 and 23emphasize the importance of family and dignity, stating that "No one shall besubjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, homeor correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honor and reputation."[23] The ICCPR's standards andprotections are of a fundamental and general nature. The fact that some of themare addressed in more detail in other, more specific international instrumentsdoes not affect their legal force pursuant to the ICCPR. Hence, some of thespecific instruments discussed below formulate standards already prescribed bythe ICCPR and are relevant not only directly, but also indirectly as providingguidance on the interpretation of the ICCPR in specific settings.[24]TheUnited Stateshas also ratified the Conventionagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment(CAT). As a party to this treaty, the United States undertook not only tooutlaw acts of inhuman and degrading treatment, but to ensure that education and informationregarding the prohibition be fully included in the training and therules or instructions issued in regard to the duties and functions of all personnel, publicofficials, and other persons who may be involved in the confinement ortreatment of any individual subjected to any form of arrest or detention. Individualstates within the UnitedStates are also bound.[25]Parties to the treaty have an obligation to systematically review arrangementsfor the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any form of confinement witha view to ensuring that no inhuman or degrading treatment occurs.[26] If a person allegesill-treatment, he or she has a right to complain to, and to have his casepromptly and impartially examined by, authorities of the jurisdiction inquestion.[27]In relation to its obligations under CAT, the United States has already beenadvised by the supervising committee that it should "adopt all appropriate measures to ensure thatwomen in confinement are treated in conformity with international standards."[28]Those international standards are found in other instrumentsthat concern specific populations such as the Convention on the Rights of theChild (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination Against Women (CEDAW), both of which are especially relevant tothe girls who are the topic of this report.TheConvention on the Rights of the Child was signed by the U.S. in 1995. Although the CRC isyet to be ratified by Congress,[29] the Supreme Court expresslyacknowledged its authority as an expression of "the overwhelming weight ofinternational opinion" in interpreting domestic legal standards, specificallystating that the "express affirmation of certain fundamental rights by othernations and peoples simply underscores the centrality of those same rightswithin our own heritage of freedom."[30]TheConvention on the Rights of the Child identifies the family as the fundamentalunit of society, emphasizing its importance for child development.[31] The Convention containsfundamental guarantees including freedom from violence, sexual abuse, anddiscrimination, as well as rights to health care, an education, freeexpression, and privacy.[32] The Convention specificallyrequires all government institutions responsible for the care of children tofollow standards ensuring children's health and well-being.[33] According to the treaty,"Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect forthe inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes intoaccount the needs of persons of his or her age."[34] The Convention on theRights of the Child also prohibits states from subjecting children to "cruel,inhuman, or degrading treatment."[35]The Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), aimed at ensuring the equal rights ofmen and women, requires gender equality in areas such as education and healthcare.[36] Signed by the United Statesin 1980, it further reiterates the general demand of equality of the sexesfound in prior international agreements. CEDAW, as well as the ICCPR, theConvention on the Rights of the Child, and the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), discussed below, all containprovisions prohibiting discrimination based on sex.[37]TheICESCR broadly articulates a number of basic rights of which some, such as theright to an education, are especially relevant to incarcerated children. Inaddition, failures by state governments to protect ICESCR rights such as therights to family, state-provided education promoting a sense of human dignity,and physical and mental health care,[38] create and exacerbate thepathways to incarceration described in this report. The United States signed the ICESCR in1979, but has yet to ratify it.In addition to relevant treaties,[39] there is a body ofinternational legal instruments setting out more specific standards protectingthe rights of incarcerated children. While these standards are not treaties, andtherefore not binding as a matter of law in the same way, they representinternational consensus and are considered authoritative. They also provide interpretiveguidance on the implementation of the rights addressed in the fundamentaltreaties discussed above. The oldest of these sets of rules is the StandardMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, passed by the First U.N. Congresson the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders in 1955 and approved bythe Economic and Social Council in 1957 and 1977. The U.N. Minimum StandardRules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules) wereadopted in 1985 and many of their principles are also found in the Conventionon the Rights of the Child. The U.N. Rules for the Protection of JuvenilesDeprived of their Libertywere adopted in 1990 along with the U.N. Guidelines for the Prevention ofJuvenile Delinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines).In sum, the ICCPR, the othertreaties to which the UnitedStates is a signatory, and theU.N.-promulgated rules clarifying the broad commands of treaties reflectinternational consensus on standards applicable to the incarceration ofchildren. It is not only the federal government that is bound by these laws. New YorkState's institutions are also obligated to comply withthese minimum standards and protections. First and foremost, as noted above,treaties ratified by the UnitedStates constitute "the supreme Law of the Land"pursuant to Article 6 section 2 of the Constitution, and "the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby."[40]In addition, the fundamental guaranteesenumerated in international laws and standards reflect the world's consensus onapplicable minimum standards; moreover, many of the enumerated rights coincidewith those contained in federal and state law and professional standards governingjuvenile facilities.Finally,New YorkState should strive to meet and surpass theseminimum standards regardless of legal obligations to do so. The norms referredto represent an international consensus as to good practice in the field ofcriminal justice and the rights and best interests of children. New YorkState considers itself a leader in manyareas of policy, including in its response to crime and delinquency. In keepingwith its pioneering sense of self, NewYorkStateshould not only meet but exceed these standards in serving some of the mostvulnerable children within its borders.II. Girls in the NewYork Juvenile Justice SystemOnce you get into the system, it's kindof hard to get out.[41]Girls' Delinquency:Systemic Failures and Pathways to IncarcerationThe United Nations Rules forthe Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty permit the incarceration of a childonly "as a last resort and for the minimum necessary period."[42] In New York,over 2,000 children are placed in OCFS custody every year.[43] The proportion of girls among these children has grown fromabout 14 percent in the mid-nineties to over 18 percent in 2003 and 2004.[44] Of the girls in custody, about a third are confined in thehigh- and medium-level security facilities of Tryon and Lansing.[45] Who are these children, why are they arrested and jailed,and are they truly incarcerated only as "ameasure of last resort?"The SocialWelfare SystemLikeboys, girls typically enter the system with a background of familial poverty,disruption, and disadvantage. Of children taken into OCFS custody in 2004,about 63% came from New York City, especiallythe poorer Bronx and KingsCounties.[46] Only 23% came from two-parenthouseholds.[47]In New YorkState, a high percentageof single-parent families with children, 33 percent, live in poverty.[48] Poverty is a major risk factor for delinquency, and often isaccompanied by other risk factors related to family disruption.[49]Incarcerated girls inparticular have frequently experienced emotional, physical, and/orsexual abuse at home.[50] This history of abuse may be the most significant underlyingcause of behaviors leading to girls' delinquency.[51] In New York,an informal survey of incarcerated girls conducted in the 1980s by OCFSofficials found that over 70 percent had experienced physical or sexual abuseprior to their incarceration.[52] This finding is consistentwith national estimates.[53] Histories of abuse and trauma help explain why, nationally,the majority of girls entering the juvenile justice system suffer frompost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other mental health problems, substanceabuse, and physical ailments.[54]Recognizingthe causal link between disadvantage, unmet basic needs, and delinquency,international norms, including those concerned with delinquency prevention,stress governments' duty to provide basic services to children such as "adequate medical and mental health care, nutrition, housingand other relevant services, including drug and alcohol abuse prevention andtreatment."[55] International standards also call ongovernments to provide services and support to families experiencinginstability and conflict,[56] and to work to "prevent domestic violence against and affectingyoung persons and to ensure fair treatment to these victims of domesticviolence."[57] Specifically, these standards urge states to providetreatment and adequate follow-up services for children and their families whenabuse does occur.[58] The experience of legal and social service providers in New York confirms that"[m]uch of girls' criminal behavior could be prevented with adequate services .. . ."[59]Yetin New Yorkand elsewhere, the disadvantages of children who, in light of their backgroundare already at high risk for delinquency, are exacerbated by multiple failuresin the social systems that should provide care and services to them and theirfamilies.[60]According to legal and social service providers, "theservices and support that should be in place to prevent criminal behavior arelacking."[61] Crucial but failing government systems include the health,child welfare, and educational systems. As a New York delinquency defense attorney putit:Detention andcommitment institutions are just a repository for the failures of the otherparts of the system. They just take whatever everyone else won't take. Like theOffice of Mental Health in this state that has failed the teenage population toa great extent, so a lot of kids are locked up because there's no other placeto live, and they claim they'll get mental health services, but they don't, orif they do, it's in a lockup which isn't a therapeutic environment. So theOffice of Mental Health, and ACS,[62] and school systems need to be looked at.[63]New York suffers from state-widehealthcare deficiencies including poor access to services for children withmental health needs, especially for those receiving public assistance andMedicaid. This failure can result in girls being confined in juvenile prisonsnot only because they manifest preventable but untreated behavior problems, butalso because overwhelmed parents feel they cannot control their childrenwithout state intervention, or because judges recognize that incarceration isthe only way to guarantee access to health services.[64] According to a study of child mental health services in NewYork, lack of access to adequate care sets children up for later encounterswith the juvenile justice system by encouraging frustrated families torelinquish mentally ill children to state custody and ignoring health problemsuntil the point of criminal "crisis."[65]Family instability frequently leads girls as well as boys to involvement withthe child welfare system, including the foster care system, either because ofparental abuse or neglect or through the filing of a petition, often by aparent, requesting the court's help in supervising a child.[66]Ironically, contact with the child welfare system is frequently not only unhelpfulto families in crisis but is itself a risk factor for juvenile justiceinvolvement. In New York,a well-traveled pathway has emerged wherein children who suffer abuse areplaced in foster care where they commit a delinquent offense, initiating theirinvolvement with OCFS.[67] Foster children are overrepresented in New York City juvenile detention, and thebias is particularly strong where girls are concerned.[68] Stephanie Q., now 18 years old, describes her path into thesystem:My father usedto hit me, it was corporal punishment. I was in foster care since I was 12. Iwas in ACS[69] group homes. They were like any other grouphomes. . . . It's like an institution, with shifts, they baby-sit us. Theydon't get personal, they don't tell us anything to do, they just sit in theoffice just to be there so they can say an adult is there. . . The kids arewild, you find every type in there. . . It was everyday drama. That's why I gotlocked up, someone would steal something, and I was an angry child, so everytime someone did something to me there was a violent reaction, so they'd callthe cops and I'd get sent to Spofford[70] or Crossroads[71] or whatever. I had the same judge over andover again, I guess he finally got tired of me and sent me upstate.[72]Foster care group homes likeStephanie Q.'s former home may place already traumatized children in difficultenvironments while also failing to provide meaningful adult involvement in theirlives. Children in such placements are also more likely to be incarcerated thanchildren not in foster care because an adult rarely is present to advocate forthem when they are arrested and because when a foster child is detained, anotherchild typically is immediately assigned to that child's foster placement, makingreturn to the original placement impossible for the detained child.[73] In New York,errors such as miscommunication between police, OCFS, and other relevantorganizations cause foster children to go unrepresented in their firstencounters with the juvenile justice system. Adults, such as foster parents andcaseworkers, who are authorized to act as legal guardians, are often either notnotified by the police of a child's arrest, or when called, refuse tointervene, leaving children without an advocate and therefore more likely to besentenced to detention.[74] In addition, in NewYork, foster children with serious physical andmental health needs who have not committed any offense are often placed inprivate "residential treatment centers" alongside children who have alreadybeen adjudged delinquent, confined in a secure juvenile facility, andsubsequently "stepped down" to the same center.[75] The net effect of the close proximity between the fostercare and juvenile justice systems is a "foster care to prison pipeline" in New York.SchoolsI wasn'tgetting good grades. I got transferred because a girl did graffiti on the wallagainst white people. They kicked me out. The principal didn't want me inschool anymore.[76]Where families andgovernment agencies struggle to help children, schools can and sometimes doprovide the care and positive engagement children need for healthy development.Specifically with respect to girls, success in school has been found tomitigate the negative effects of abuses like sexual assault, leading to lessaggressive behavior and vandalism by abused girls, and therefore to a lowerlikelihood of juvenile justice involvement.[77] Recognizing the importance of educational opportunities inpreventing delinquent behavior in children, international standards emphasize thatstates have a particular responsibility to ensure schools are environmentswhich nurture children at social risk.[78] In New York, however, there are many schools in which childrenare not engaged academically or their learning disabilities are neitherdiagnosed nor accommodated, and which implement "push-out" measures, "zerotolerance" disciplinary policies and "high-stakes" testing.[79] Such an environment can do more harm than good forvulnerable children.Educational advocates in NewYork have documented the systematic use of "push-out" tactics in city schools,such as illegally expelling students based on spurious claims that they were"too old, did not have enough credits, or were not on track to earn a diplomain four years."[80] In the majority of cases it is students who are already atrisk for juvenile offense who bear the brunt of the negative effects of thesepolicies, as they are singled out for removal based on lagging performance,their dependence on relatively expensive special needs programs, and previousinvolvement in the juvenile justice system.[81]What is more, that firstencounter with the juvenile justice system is often precipitated directly byschool policies. "Zero tolerance" policies in schools are those imposingautomatic, severe penalties on students, such as suspension or expulsion, oftenfor relatively minor rule violations.[82] Such policies reflect theories of deterrence and segregationfrom the larger community, and mirror the retributory characteristics of theadult and juvenile justice systems. By mandating harsh responses to relativelyminor misconduct these policies trigger contact with the criminal justicesystem for behavior that could be addressed in a less punitive fashion.[83] In addition, NewYork has poured record numbers of police into thecorridors of so-called "impact schools," institutions which borrow the tacticsof recent neighborhood anti-crime campaigns using additional patrols and "zerotolerance" policies ostensibly to decrease school violence.[84] This tactic has been decried by students and educators asproviding questionable safety gains while ensuring that troubled students notonly face removal from the academic environment but are almost immediatelybrought before a judge for their offenses and thus are "criminalized."[85]Harsh disciplinary policieswhose intended or foreseeable effect is to remove from schools children viewedas troublesome violate international standards.[86] Even relatively mild academic performance policies like NewYork City's retention policy, which systematically holds children back in gradelevels to boost school performance, can work to the detriment of vulnerableyouth.[87] Although such policies do not immediately remove childrenfrom schools, they threaten instead to encourage school drop-out by the verystudents for whom school engagement represents a crucial safeguard againstjuvenile offense. There is also some evidence suggesting that when schoolsexclude troubled students, girls in particular suffer. Negative attitudestoward school and truancy, suspension, poor grades, or expulsion, are even morepowerful predictors of delinquency in girls than in boys.[88] Once displaced from more nurturing networks in the schooland the home, both boys and girls face an increased risk of involvement withthe juvenile justice system.Juvenile JusticeProcessing and the Incarceration of GirlsIn New York and nationally, girls represent an increasing but stillrelatively small proportion of children who enter the juvenile justice system.[89]Like the larger society, the juvenile justice system in New York regularlydisadvantages children from marginalized and institutionalized backgrounds, butgirls face specific problems.Developments in thePolicing of GirlsInthe early twentieth century, prevailing juvenile justice ideology resulted inattempts to police girls' behavior and especially their sexual morality,leading to a high rate of institutionalization of girls as compared with boysfor offenses that would not be crimes if committed by adults.[90] These acts, known as "status offenses," and designated underNew York lawas "PINS" offenses include habitual disobedience of parents, truancy, and"incorrigibility."[91] Since that time, it has generally been the case that girlsare disproportionately charged with and incarcerated for status offenses andtechnical violations such as the violation of probation,[92] a trend attributed to gender bias in the decision-making ofpolice, prosecutors, judges, and others involved in the process.[93] Status offenses, as well as other nonviolent acts such asdrug use and larceny, can, in turn, often be traced to histories of abuse.Girls may run away from abusive homes but be arrested for the act of runningaway itself, or for engaging in petty theft or prostitution as means ofeconomic survival on the streets.[94] In New York,although a child under 17 years of age is considered legally incapable ofconsenting to sex,[95] she may still be convicted of prostitution if she engages incommercial sex.[96] This state of affairs has been criticized as penalizingabused and commercially sexually exploited children.[97]Ebony V. ran away from anabusive home and was prostituted by a man in his thirties.[98] She was arrested on a prostitution charge and held in the Lansing facility, whereshe was again sexually exploited. Contrasting what she viewed as the justicesystem's lenient treatment of adult men who buy sex from children with itsharsh treatment of commercially sexually exploited girls, Ebony V. said:The system ismade for us to fail. Put it like this: A young person like me can get arrestedand get put away for a year and a half, then another year for what adults didto her. A lot of times it's not our fault, it's an adult's fault and they treatus like adults in there.[99]Alternatively, abused andtraumatized girls who are deprived of necessary mental health counseling or treatmentmay self-medicate with alcohol or other drugs.[100] Bless L., for example, told HRW/ACLU:I'm from Staten Island. My mother, when I was young, was alwaysabusing me. She was doing drugs and everything, and my grandparents got custodyof me. Then my grandmother passed away. I started bugging out, I started using weed,coke, liquor, I'd get it from friends, people selling on the corner, wherever.My grandfather was using and I was using with him, so he knew.[101]A New York delinquency attorney observes that"There's a fair amount of self-medicating going on among the girls. It'sidentified as a chronic drug problem, but really it's the underlying problem thatnever gets addressed."[102] The justice system's response to these patterns, that ofarresting and prosecuting the girls concerned, has been dubbed the"criminalization of girls' survival strategies."[103]Girls benefited from thedeinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s, specifically the passage of the federalJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974 and itsprohibition of the incarceration of status offenders. Girls were incarceratedless frequently during the years following the JJDPA's passage.[104] During the 1980s, however, national concern over "missingand exploited youth" helped to motivate an amendment to the JJDPA allowing forthe incarceration of status offenders violating a valid court order, includingorders setting the terms of their probation. From this revision arose ajudicial practice that became known as "bootstrapping" or "relabeling," wherebya child is jailed for violating a court order arising from a status offense,resulting in the incarceration of girls whose original charge was a statusoffense.[105]Bootstrapping allowedjudges to circumvent the JJDPA's ban on incarcerating status offenders, andalso constituted a violation of international standards insofar as itdisproportionately affected girls. In the 1992 reauthorization of the JJDPA, thepractice was outlawed.[106] As of 1996, children accused of PINS offenses in New York may no longerbe placed in OCFS custody.[107] While these key legal reforms have helped to reduce theincarceration of children, the evidence indicates that, nationally, girls continueto be arrested and incarcerated disproportionately for status offenses.[108]In New York,girls are increasingly arrested for violent offenses such as assault;[109]indeed, of girls entering Lansing and Tryon in the last three years, 49 percentwere adjudicated to have committed a crime against a person, of which 35percent were classified as "assaults."[110]Although girls as well as boys can and do engage in physicalviolence, somescholars argue that violent behavior among girls has not increased, but thatpolicing and charging practices have.[111] A recent study of national datacollected between 1980 and 2003 attributes the apparent increase in girls'violent crime to "net-widening" changes in law and police practices resultingin criminal penalties for less serious forms of violence; violence in privatesettings, such as the home; the arrest of less-culpable offenders, such asaccomplices and those acting in self-defense; and a decrease in the tendency ofpolice, parents, teachers, and social workers to excuse girls' physical orverbal aggression.[112] Official sources also suggestthat, nationwide, the increase in girls' arrests for violent offenses,especially assault, arises from changes in enforcement rather than in girls'behavior.[113]Other recent changes inpolice procedure, such as the policy of mandatory arrests when responding todomestic violence calls, may account for part of the increase in the number ofadolescent girls being charged with assault for relatively minor mutual physicalaltercations with parents.[114] In our research, we found some examples of this. Marisol U.,[115] whose case is profiled below, and other girls interviewed by HRW/ACLU entered the juvenilejustice system as a result of family violence. Felicia H., from Queens, New York,was removed from her mother's care when she was eight years old and placed in afoster home she describes as chaotic. She ran away several times back to hermother's home. At home, her step-father occasionally hit her until she was tenor eleven, when she called the police, after which her step-father did not hither again. Although she was no longer physically abused, Felicia H. feltneglected by her mother and step-father and often ran away for several days ata time. When asked about her arrest, she said:I got arrestedfor assault. That's when I was 12 or 13. My mom and I were fighting because Ihad run away and came home high. We were fighting and she got mad. I wascutting onions, I called my mom a ho, she came to hit me and since I had theknife, she called the police and they arrested me. They came they gave me achoice to stay at home or go to Spofford. I decided to go to Spofford because Iwas mad.[116]A New York delinquency attorney states "Somegirls have been abused all their lives . . .. Finally, they get to an age wherethey can hit back. And they get locked up."[117]CaseStudy: Marisol U.Marisol U., from theBronx, New York City, is 15 years old. In these excerpts from an interviewwith HRW/ACLU, Marisol U. describes how she became caught up in the juvenilesystem.[118]It's tough growing up around there. There are drug dealerseverywhere you go and girls that want to fight you for no reason. It wasfighting and drugs, everywhere you go. But I just stayed out of it by nothanging out with those kinds of people. I always had my older sister. She'dbeen through a lot of things, she's a grown woman now. She guidances [sic]me, she gives me advice.My father is schizophrenic, so is my mother a little bit.She hasn't been diagnosed but sometimes she takes his meds to calm hernerves. My mom sees a psychiatrist, but she goes whenever she wants to, andshe usually cancels her appointments. She has health problems, too. Usuallywe're on public assistance.My father embarrasses my friends, especially when he's offhis meds. He yells at them, and he send them home when they come to see me.Especially if it's a boy, once my friends came over and my dad went crazy inthe hallway. He opened the door and started screaming at them. I got upsetand spoke up. I said, "They're not disturbing no one, there's no reason toact like that." He slapped me across the face hard, it left a mark for awhile. I don't know what got into me but I went and got a knife, I didn'tstab him or anything but my mom didn't know how to react to it so she calledthe police and they came and arrested me. And because the situation happenedat home, they don't want to send you home so they sent me to an NSD[non-secure detention facility] instead.I feel like I didn't even fit in there. I'm not the type ofgirl who's out on the street smoking or whatever. I was just there because ofmy father's schizophrenia. Once my sister came to the facility to see me. Shesaw me with my hands behind my back, with a jumper on, and she started crying.Janine Y.'s experience istypical of children whose identification as a person in need of supervision facilitatestheir entry into the delinquency system:My father's incarcerated and I don't know where my mom's at. Mygrandma raised me. I was at East Middle, I think it's called. It was in Binghamton. It's a juniorhigh. I was bad in school and the school kicked me out and they told mygrandmother she had to put a PINS on me or else I couldn't go back to school.She didn't want to, she didn't think I needed it. I was 12 or 13. . . .So I had a PINS petition and I violatedcurfew, and they sent me to a group home. I didn't like it there so I kickedone of their screen windows out, so I ended up at OCFS.[119]For girls previouslyremanded to OCFS custody and released, even minor misbehavior can have severeconsequences. Many girls are conditionally released from OCFS subject torespecting terms such as curfews and orders to attend school. If they violatethese orders, they are incarcerated again. Janine Y. was held at TryonReceptionCenter, then a non-securefacility, and later at Brooklyn Residential Facility, or "BRC," an OCFSfacility in which "revocators," or girls who violate the conditions of release,are held. She described her path to BRC:I've been at BRC three timesalready. I've got a curfew problem. The reason I'm here now is because I didn'tgo to school. . . . A lot of girls here are like that.If you did another crime you'd most likelyget charged all over again so you'd go to [Tryon] Reception [Center] and thenupstate. So most of the people here are for curfew and stuff.[120]Several other girlsincarcerated in New Yorkand interviewed by HRW/ACLU described similar experiences. When asked why theywere confined, girls answered: "I revocated because of curfew. I'm not a curfewperson, I break curfew all the time[121]"; "My original charge was assault but then I violatedprobation"[122]; "Originally, I got caught for criminal trespassing,breaking and entering. Me and my friend broke into a house. It was emptythough, there was no one living in it. I got put in a group home and I AWOLed"[123]; and "I was having problems at a RTC [residential treatmentcenter]. Then after LansingI was in aftercare, in independent living. I went to an OCFS group home after Lansing, for eight months,then still OCFS, then went AWOL, then got sent to Tryon."[124]The Incarceration ofGirlsBoth international standardsand some provisions of New YorkState law are premised onthe principle that the institutionalization of children should be avoided wheneverpossible.[125] Yet through the 1990s, the number of children held in New York'spre-adjudication detention facilities increased steadily,[126] with girls entering detention at relatively high ratescompared with boys.[127] The length of time children spend in detention has alsoincreased.[128] As to post-adjudication commitment, as the number of boys taken into OCFS custody has decreased slightlybetween 1995 and 2004, the number of girls has remained more or less steady,resulting in a slight increase in the proportion of girls to close to 19percent of the total population.[129]International standardsemphatically require that a range of alternatives to incarceration be madeavailable to children accused of or found guilty of crimes,[130] and the principle of nondiscrimination mandates that suchalternatives be equally available to boys and girls.[131] Even when they are provided with alternative programs,however, girls tend to perform worse than boys, indicating a need for programsthat are specifically designed for girls.[132]New York suffers from a shortage ofalternatives to both pre-adjudication detention and post-adjudication confinement.As to pre-adjudication detention, between 1988 and 1992, New York saw among the highest increases ofany state in the rate of detention of girls as compared to boys.[133] The four New York Cityschools operated by the Probation Department as alternatives to detention were"perennially full or overcrowded, failed to provide education in accordancewith New Yorkand federal law," and were recently closed down.[134] Although both secure and non-secure detention facilitiesexist for children awaiting adjudication of their cases, the inadequatecapacity of New York City'snon-secure detention facilities has harmed girls in particular. "There has beena consistent lack of adequate non-secure detention space for girls, causinggirls who need a group home setting to be illegally jailed."[135] This conflicts with international standards, whichspecifically require that "whenever possible, detention pending trial shall bereplaced by alternative measures, such as close supervision, intensive care orplacement with a family or in an educational setting or home."[136]As to post-adjudicationplacement, there are over 3,000 children confined in various OCFS facilities inNew YorkState.[137]New Yorkis "severely lacking" in non-incarceration placements for children, especiallyfor girls,[138] and some children have been incarcerated because of a lackof available alternative residential placements.[139] According to Nancy Rosenbloom,director of the Special Litigation unit of the Legal Aid Society's JuvenileRights Division, "many of the most desirable non-secure residential placementsonly accept boys."[140] According to a facilities service provider, the privatizationof group homes in New Yorkis another factor resulting in greater rates of incarceration for girls:Now homes cansay, "we don't want HIV positive girls" or "we don't want girls with a drughistory." So some of the girls in there [OCFS facilities] have done nothingwrong, there's just nowhere to go. . . . You get sweet, timid, shy youngladies, mixed in with girls who are rougher and tougher. The other girls werethrust into this environment that they shouldn't have been in but there wasnowhere else to put them.[141]To its credit, OCFS hastaken preliminary steps toward reducing the incarceration of children byinitiating its "Evidence-based Community Initiative" (EbCI) in 2003. Theinitiative aims to provide intensive family therapy and other services tochildren within their communities.[142] Although apparently intended at its inception to serve as analternative to institutionalization of children and as a means of shorteningthe length of children's incarceration, there is some indication that EbCI isnow primarily being offered to children after their incarceration rather thanas an alternative to confinement. OCFS's recently released 2004 Annual Reportstates, however, that "[i]n2004 there were also some Evidence-based Community Initiative (EbCI) DayPrograms that admitted youth meeting certain criteria to front end programs inlieu of residential care." Only 3 of 40, or 7.5 percent of children enteringEbCI day programs in 2004 were girls,[143] and at the end of 2004, only ninechildren were in such day programs, and all were boys.[144] There is also conflictinginformation as to the extent to which facilities' capacity has been reduced through the use of EbCI.[145]What is clear is that theeffort toward deinstitutionalization is extremely important and should begreatly expanded.The DisproportionateImpact on Girls of ColorEqual protection of the law isguaranteed by the U.S. Constitution as well as international law.[146] Yet the marginalization permeating the life experiences of girls ofcolor continues through their time in the juvenile justice system. Theincreasingly common practice among school administrators of calling the policein response to student misbehavior has a disproportionate impact on African-Americanstudents.[147] Across the U.S.,70 percent of delinquency cases involving white girls are dismissed, while only30 percent of cases involving African-American girls are dismissed.[148]Nationally,34% of 12 to 17 year olds in the U.S. are girls of color, yet theyaccount for 52% of those detained for juvenile offenses.[149]In New YorkState,54 percent of children in the general population are Caucasian, 20 percent areLatino, 18 percent are African-American, and 6 percent are Asian.[150] In contrast, of the girls admittedto the Lansing and Tryon facilities over the last three years, 54 percent arenon-Hispanic African-American, 19 percent are classified as Hispanic,[151] 23 percent are non-Hispanic White,and none is Asian.10 girls, or 3 percent of the total, are Native American. One is classified asnon-Hispanic-Other.[152] The disproportionately high numberof African-American girls incarcerated in the highest security juvenile prisonsin New YorkState echoes the overalloverrepresentation of black children in OCFS: Since 1995, African-American boysand girls have consistently accounted for close to 60 percent of children takeninto OCFS custody.[153]III.Conditions of Confinement:Abusive TreatmentThepublications and public statements of the Office of Children and FamilyServices paint a picture of juvenile facilities in which girls and boys are keptsafe and provided an impressive range of individualized services.[154]The views of children currently or formerly held in OCFS facilities as well asjuvenile justice experts paint a different picture, one of an agen cyconfronted with children with exceptionally significant and complex needs, in whichoverwhelmed staff too often use excessive physical force and other forms ofabuse, including threats, and where services such as counseling and education oftenare inadequate.[155]Girls' stories of their experiences in the facilities focus on their day to dayinteractions with staff, some of whom treat their wards with compassion andgood humor, many of whom are simply marking time, and some of whomaffirmatively harm the children in their "care."Girlsincarcerated at Lansing and Tryon experience serious threats to their safety.Some girls complain that other girls attack, threaten, and confront them, orspread rumors and personal information about them and that staff fail tointervene to stop peer violence and mistreatment.[156]Generally, however, complaints of peer-to-peer abuse are relatively rare, whilereports of staff abuse of girls, especially under the guise of the "restraint"procedure, are common.HRW/ACLUattempted to corroborate girls' accounts of abuse by recourse to agencyrecords, but our request for incident reports that would reflect staff accountsof situations in which they used restraints was categorically denied.[157]Nevertheless, the number and consistency of reports among interviewed childrenand adults, as well as available documentary evidenceincluding references inthe facilities' monthly reportsleave little doubt that Lansing and Tryon havea serious problem of abuse that has yet to be addressed.Excessive Use of Physical "Restraints"It was grown men there attacking girls like they hadno sense.[158]Girlsheld in both the Lansing and Tryon facilities told us that staff frequentlyemploy physical force in response to minor rules violations that pose no threatto the security or safety of either staff or girls. The force is not only usedwithout just cause, but is excessive, sometimes resulting in injuries to girlsand staff. The exercise of force against girls almost always takes the form ofa procedure known as a "prone restraint" or "face down restraint" and is referredto by staff and incarcerated girls simply as a "restraint."[159] In a restraint, one or morefacilities staff seize a girl from behind and push her to the floor, face down.They then pull her arms up behind her and hold or handcuff them.Like adults, children havethe right to be free from violence and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.[160] This right also applies toprisoners, who must be treated with humanity and dignity,[161] and to incarceratedchildren, whom governments must protect from "all forms of physical or mentalviolence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment orexploitation, including sexual abuse . . . ."[162] Corporal punishment ofincarcerated children constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.[163] The use of physical forceagainst incarcerated children is strictly prohibited by internationalstandards, except "in order to prevent the juvenile from inflictingself-injury, injuries to others or serious destruction of property.[164] Even in such circumstancesforce can only be used, "in exceptional cases, where all other control methodshave been exhausted and failed, and only as explicitly authorized and specifiedby law and regulation."[165] This "harm to self orothers" rule is echoed in recognized U.S. standards governing thetreatment of incarcerated children.[166]Statutory law governing OCFSabsolutely forbids corporal punishment "for any purpose and under allcircumstances,"[167] and permits the use ofphysical restraints as well as isolated confinement only when a child"constitutes a serious and evident danger to himself or others."[168] OCFS's internal policyregarding the use of force, however, is more permissive than what is legallymandated. In addition to cases in which a child poses a threat to herself orothers, the policy permits restraints in two broad categories of cases: "Toenforce a direct order to a resident for reasons of safety or control,"including an instruction to move or stay still, and "To respond to an immediatethreat to the safe, secure operation of the facility."[169]Girlswho had been confined in OCFS facilities described the use of the forcibleface-down restraint in numerous situations which did not suggest dangers orthreats to security, staff, or any residents. Girls described being restrainedor witnessing others being restrained for: failing to hold their hands behindtheir back in the prescribed manner when standing in line, holding and waving acomb while speaking to a staff member,failing to make their bed correctly,talking back to staff or"acting out," misbehaving in school,not following directions,refusing to go swimming, "mouthing off,"not raising their hands before speaking oracting, being loud,moving withoutpermission, and "playing around."[170] As a girl formerly held at Lansing stated, "Theythought restraints were the answer to everything. They'd use them foranything."[171]StephanieQ., now 18 years old, described the use of restraints for failure to follow anorder given by a staff member:They only give you one time to follow a directive. Ifthey tell you something and you don't do it, that's grounds for them torestrain you. What if you didn't hear? What if you didn't understand? I used tosee this girl, she didn't speak English, she didn't understand what was goingon. They didn't care, they'd restrain her, like for not getting in line whenthey said to.[172]Accordingto interviewed girls, staff sometimes unnecessarily increase the use of forceused during a restraint. Alicia K., who was incarcerated at both Tryon andLansing when she was between 15 and 17 years old, described one of severalrestraints she experienced:It was in the medical unit. I forget who restrained me.It was probably for refusing to move. There were two people to start off with.They hook up under your arms from behind and throw you to the ground. If youwere "resisting" as they like to call it, they push harder. They pull your armsbehind you and push up. My thumb touched the back of my head. That youresisted, that's the excuse they use. They say "Stop resisting! Stop resisting!"even though you're not moving. That time it was four or five different staff,mostly male.[173]Anotherformerly incarcerated girl, Devon A., was also held at each facility betweenthe ages of 15 and 17. She said: "The trick they had was to 'escort' you, tohold you standing up and if you moved even a little you were going to thefloor."[174]Asdescribed by interviewees and confirmed by agency documents, use of therestraint procedure sometimes results in injury to girls and staff.[175] For example, an agency letteraddressed to a staff member states: "On November 6, 2004 . . . you usedinappropriate and excessive physical force with resident [name redacted] duringher restraint. Specifically, you punched resident [name redacted] in the leg."[176] In one month in 2002, theTryon facility reported that 15 of its 76 residents received medical attentionfollowing restraints.[177] The most common injuryreported by girls was facial abrasions, sometimes severe. Among residents of juvenileprisons, these facial injuries are called "rug burns."Selena B. was 12 when she was sent to TryonReception. She told HRW/ACLU:I was restrained once because I wouldn't eat fish,because I'm allergic. So the lady told staff, and staff threw my foodaway.I got upset and started yelling.They took me to the bathroom. They take you and throw you on the ground. Oneman and a woman grab you and throw you on the ground. I got a rug burn. I had ascar for about two weeks.[178]Whileincarcerated at Tryon, Felicia H., 17 years old at the time, was restrained andsuffered a serious facial abrasion that took three weeks to heal. She wrote toHRW/ACLU:Staff here do restraints and they do it bad. I beenrestrained two times during my stay here and they do it to hurt you. And if youdon't get along with that staff then they hurt you, like when I got restraintthey had messed up my face real bad, they broke someone's arm before, busted mylip, that's one thing I don't like about here. . . . [T]hey shouldn't touch us'cause us kids get hurt real bad.[179]Formerlyincarcerated girls described seeing others restrained, or seeing injuries toothers in the aftermath of restraints, including at least one instance of abroken arm and a broken leg.:"You'd see kids walking around with rug burns on their facesfrom their temple all the way down to the bottom of their chin, with crutches,one girl was in crutches and a cast because they broke her arm and leg. Theyhad bent her up like a pretzel," said Devon A.[180]"I was never restrained upstate. I've seen girls get rugburns, bad bad bad, rug burns, where you can see the meat of their faces andso I make it my business not to get restrained," 16-year-old Denise J. reported.[181]Oneincarcerated girl complained that she suffered backaches since beingrestrained, and although facilities staff gave her Motrin in response to hercomplaints of pain, the medicine did not help.[182] Facility records confirmthat girls are injured during restraints. Such injuries include lacerationsrequiring sutures and, in one instance, a concussion.[183]Somegirls reported that some staff members seemed to vent their anger on girls.Alicia K., said, "It seems like the staff like restraining kids."[184] Anne C., 15 and 16 yearsold at the time of her incarceration, said:It's aggression that the staff puts on you. The staff areso quick to put their hands on you. I know they're trained to put you on theground, but sometimes it seems like they don't care how they do it.[185]Thefacilities' grievance logs also suggest that the misuse of the restraintprocedure is a perennial problem at both the Tryon and Lansing facilities.[186] Alicia K., quoted above,gave further details about her restraint in the medical unit of Tryon:When they push your arms up [behind your back], they kindof slide you across the floor at the same time. You try not to say anything,but after they keep going you start yelling and cursing. Then they puthandcuffs and shackles on you until they feel you're calm enough. That time itwas an hour. They ask if you're calm. If you're not they just leave you thereand stand there having a nice little conversation like nothing happened, likeabout the new motorcycle they just got, like everything's O.K. Then they let onehandcuff go and you put your hand forward. If that one's not moving they letthe other one go. Then you go to the nurse and they document your injuries.[187]Stephanie Q. also described being restrained and keptin a prone position for a long period of time. Her account suggests that girlssometime resist the use of force by staff and escalation quickly occurs. Suchescalation is particularly likely if staff have not been properly trained inmanaging and defusing confrontation. Stephanie Q., as well assome other interviewed girls, interpreted some instances of restraints asintentionally inflicting pain or harm:When theyrestrain kids, they purposely hurt them, seriously. . . .They'd have rug burnsall over their bodies. You can see that they're doing it on purpose. . . Theyhold your arms back and they purposefully push your face in the rug. They havetheir knee in your back and your arms all the way back. I've been restrainedbefore so I know. It makes me angry, I just want to fight some more. They havean advantage over you because there's like five of them, and that just makesyou angrier. Most of my restraints, I fell asleep, because they had to hold medown for so long. I got a scar on my face, it was a discoloration. I don't haveit anymore, that was years ago. It could last for maybe six months. How longthey hold you down depends on how long you're being defiant. If it gets long,like more than an hour and a half, they'll get the handcuffs and shackles andleave you there. At the OCFS facilities out in the country, they'll start usingthe handcuffs and shackles.[188]Accordingto Alicia K., "Some staff were known for restraints. If you got restrained bythem you got at least one injury. They'd talk about restraints they did wherethey hurt a resident. Kind of like they were bragging about it. Most of thestaff known for restraints were male."[189] The cavalier attitude takenby some OCFS employees is reflected in official records of a staff member"making remarks about 'betting' when residents would be restrained."[190]DanaG., who is 16 and was pregnant when she was subjected to the restraintprocedure, described her experience at Tryon:I didn't like how you had to put your hands behind yourback, and how they'd restrain you. I was four months pregnant, and this [staffmember] slammed me up against the wall. I could've miscarried! He knew I waspregnant because I had purple laces.[191]I was in the mudroom[192]standing with my hands in a diamond.[193]He was talking to me and I told him to "shut the f up." That's when he took meand slammed me.[194]Althoughmost of the physical violence perpetrated by staff against girls incarceratedat Lansing andTryon appears to be some form of a "restraint," OCFS records suggest that otherkinds of violence, including forms that are never permissible, also occur. Thefacilities' complaint logs and other records also contain reports of girlsbeing hit,[195] kicked,[196] choked,[197] thrown against a wall,[198] and subjected to the use of"pressure points."[199] In one incident reported ina facility's monthly report, a girl complained that "a staff was handplayingwith her and caused bruising on her neck."[200] Unsurprisingly, our reviewof three years of grievances from both facilities revealed numerous complaintsthat children do not feel safe at the facility or do not feel safe in thepresence of a particular staff member.The use of excessive force occurring in the Lansingand Tryon facilities would be damaging to any child, but it may be especiallyharmful to girls. As noted above, a high proportion of incarcerated girls haveexperienced physical and sexual abuse in the past,[201] making them especiallysusceptible to additional trauma upon being assaulted by an adult whileincarcerated. Girls' experiences of trauma may also expose them to greaterphysical harm during a restraint: According to an expert in juvenilecrisis-management techniques, when staff seize previously-abused girls andthrow them to the floor, they replicate and provoke past trauma. In part becauseof their past experiences, these girls may not acquiesce to the application offorce, and their resistance may be exaggerated, in turn escalating thesituation even further.[202]Of course, even absent a past experience ofphysical abuse, children already embroiled in an escalating confrontation thenabruptly seized and pushed to the floor may react in kind with physicalaggression.Thefrequency of restraints in the investigated facilities and the proclivity ofstaff to escalate staff/girl conflicts to physical violence rather than toprevent or deescalate such conflicts also points to a failure to recognize andrespond to girls' needs. Research has revealed that incarcerated girlsexperience a high level of anxiety and anger from past trauma, leading tointense, uncontrollable emotions.[203] Experts prescribe teachingsuch girls "self-soothing" techniques to employ when they begin to feelanxious.[204] Yet such techniques are notconsistently utilized at OCFS facilities, where some staff lack the trainingand skills necessary to resolve a confrontation with a child in a way thatsaves face for themselves and protects the child.[205]Monthlyreports by facility administrators at Lansing and Tryon confirm girls' accountsof the frequent use of restraints. At Lansing,the number of forcible face-down restraints per month at that facility betweenJanuary 2004 and January 2006 ranged from 35 to 108 and averaged 65. Theaverage population for these months was 81 girls, yielding an average of 10restraints per child per year. For the same period, mechanical restraints suchas handcuffs were used an average of 38 times per month. This figure excludesmechanical restraints used during the transportation of girls to court andelsewhere, and likely includes handcuffing in the aftermath of physicalrestraints. Over the last two years, Lansingreported an average of 1 restraint-related injury to a girl and 2 injuries tostaff per month.[206] Monthly reports from Tryonindicate that there were between 10 and 43 face-down restraints per month,averaging 22 per month. Distributed across an average population of 77, this amountsto 3 per child per year. Tryon averaged 11 instances of use of non-transportmechanical restraints per month. Over the last three years, Tryon reported anaverage of 3 child injuries and 4 staff injuries per month as a result ofrestraints.[207]Atleast some facilities administrators are aware of the excessive use of force,and have even made attempts to reduce the frequency of use and the incidence ofmisuse of the restraint procedure.[208]At Lansing,beginning in January 2003, one of the facility's annual goals was to "Decreaseuse of physical restraints." This remained a goal until at least January 2006(the last date for which we have Lansingmonthly reports). Over the years, the monthly reports contain brief two orthree sentence references to general actions being taken to achieve the goal. Forexample, a typical statement is "We continue to make progress in thisarea.The weekly unit computation aswell as staff debriefing after every restraint continues to help in this area."[209] Nevertheless, during 2004,the per capita use increased. In 2005 it dropped slightly, but was still higherthan that in 2003. Tryon's monthly reports also include references to effortsto ensure restraints are used properly and less frequently. For example, the September2005 report notes:TheFacility director and/or Assistant Director have been attending CMPR [CrisisManagement/Physical Restraint] refreshers to discuss the need for 'safe'restraints and to brainstorm with staff on suggestions/ideas to reducerestraints. We are putting this list of suggestions together and willdistribute to staff when complete. The internal format for tracking restraintshas been revised.We will now betracking additional information to see if patterns exist. FacilityDirector/Assistant Director distributed a memo to all staff regarding the needto do restraints according to trained techniques and to reduce restraints.[210]Top OCFS administrators know about the excessive useof force. Inez Nieves, the Associate Deputy Commissioner forPrograms and Services for OCFS's Division of Rehabilitative Services and theformer director of Lansing recently convened a meeting of almost the entireLansing staff and, in relation to the use of the face-down restraint, andreportedly accused all present of being "child abusers."[211]According to knowledgeable sources, "the red flags are up everywhere."[212]HRW/ACLUreceived anecdotal reports from girls and anonymous adult sources thatexcessive use of force occurs much more frequently at Lansing than at other OCFS facilities, butefforts by HRW/ACLU to obtain comparative statistical data to verify thesereports were denied by OCFS for unclear reasons.[213] In response to HRW/ACLU'sappeal of this and other denials of information, OCFS stated: "OCFS does notmaintain cumulative statistical data regarding abuse of youth placed infacilities, disciplinary measures employed with youth, suicide or self harm."[214] This failure to maintainreadily available data reveals insufficient institutional concern regarding thedanger to children posed by the prone restraint and frustrates monitoring ofthe use of force and trends in it, whether internally or by outside observers.Staff Shortages as a Contributing Factor toExcessive ForceOurresearch suggests that physical abuse and other mistreatment are systemicproblems, not the work of a few bad eggs. Ultimate responsibility thus restsnot with the well-meaning but under-prepared and overworked line staff, butrather with the policymakers and administrators who place both the girls andtheir keepers in inordinately difficult circumstances. Understaffing in Lansing, for example, ispersistent and severe. Between January 2004 and January 2006, the Lansing facility, whosebudgeted staff level is 100, had an average of 22 staff vacancies and 6backfilled vacancies.[215]Of the actual vacancies, 13 were positions involving the direct, day to daysupervision of girls. Entries in the facilities' monthly reports regularlyinclude expressions of concern over the number of vacancies and the amount ofovertime worked by staff.[216]Lansing's staffshortage and the amount of overtime worked prevents facilities administratorsfrom being able to send staff to training sessions.[217]The Tryon facility, whose budgeted staffing level is 137, had an average of 10vacancies for the same period, of which five were counselor positions. Tryon'srecords also express concern at the number of unfilled staff positions.[218]Itis likely that the staffing shortages contribute significantly to the stressexperienced by line staff, making healthy relationships with confined girlsdifficult. The excessive "mandating" of staff, that is, requiring staff to workexcessive hours, and the intense emotional strain workers experience is describedby informed sources:They get horribly mandated, there are some who aremandated three 16 hour days in a row. You can imagine they're sleep deprived,family deprived, everything, and they're not going to be good with the kids.The staff are emotionally crumbling, they're falling apart because they're sooverworked.[219]Facilitiesadministrators and OCFS officials are aware of the effects of overwork.[220]The severe staff shortage, likely caused in part by the remote location of thefacilities, may in turn exacerbate inadequate screening of potential employeesand preclude necessary supervision.[221]The failure of supervision is also related to the self-protective bureaucraticculture pervading OCFS:Everybody has their job to do, so the YDC[222]is not constantly on the unit observing how staff are working or dealing withthe kids in any way. The top doesn't know what the bottom is doing because it'sa cover up from the bottom to the top.[223]Despitethe obstacles posed by institutional policies, staff shortages and difficultworking conditions, many facilities workers help and nurture their wards in theface of institutional failures. HRW/ACLU was told:There are some staff that are wonderful to the kids, theyreally go the extra mile, they spend their money on the kids, they buy arts andcrafts supplies, they buy them yarn to crochet with, and shampoo.[224]Thegoodwill and enthusiasm of facilities workers is also apparent in the monthlyreports generated by each facility. Although these documents are intended forOCFS administrators and as such are inclined to portray facilities' performancein a positive light, what nevertheless shines through is the difficulty ofoperating an institution with such a difficult mandate under severe budgetaryand other bureaucratic constraints, and the degree of genuine concern manystaff members show for the welfare of girls confined in the facilities.[225]Regardlessof the challenges, all juvenile institutions should provide at least theminimally acceptable conditions for children set forth in domestic andinternational laws and guidelines. International norms set standards as tostaffing levels and supervision,[226]insist on equal treatment and opportunities for girls and boys,[227]and address numerous other areas affecting the lives of incarcerated children.Excessive Security MeasuresIt feels like jail, the barbed wire, the restraints,the cells. They call them rooms but they're just like cells. They have littlebeds with thin mattresses, a desk, and you get locked in it. To me, that's acell.[228]Bothinternational and New YorkState law emphasizes theimportance of avoiding institutionalization and unnecessarily restrictivemeasures to the greatest extent possible where children are concerned.[229]International standards require in additionthat different degrees of security be available to different groups ofincarcerated persons according to their needs.[230] Certain conditions andpractices at the Lansing and Tryon facilities fail the test.Secure Conditions within Tryon's "Non-Secure" FacilityAccordingto OCFS literature, the TryonGirlsCentercomprises four distinct parts, two of which are TryonGirlsSecureCenter and TryonGirlsResidentialCenter.[231] Tryon Secure is classifiedas a "secure" facility. OCFS literature describes secure facilities as "themost controlled and restrictive" providing "intensive programming for youthrequiring a highly controlled and restrictive environment."[232] Tryon Girls, on the otherhand, is classified by OCFS as a "non-secure" facility. OCFS literature describes"non-secure facilities" as consisting of "a variety of urban and ruralresidential centers and community based programs . . . . Youth in residentialcenters require removal from the community but do not require the morerestrictive setting of a limited secure facility."[233]According to available evidence, however, there islittle or no difference between Tryon Girls and Tryon Secure in physical layoutor operation. The entire Tryon facility is encircled by perimeter fencingtopped with coils of razor-wire.[234] Within this perimeter, theboys' area and the girls' area are each encircled by a second layer of fencingwith razor wire. A third layer of razor wire-topped fencing surrounds eachhousing unit regardless of its security classification.[235] Thus there is no differencein the physical layout of the "secure" and "non-secure" girls' housing units atTryon.Proceduresare also similar in the different parts of Tryon. Visitors must pass throughmetal detectors before entering any of the Tryon units. Facility-wide, girlsare allowed only one magazine in their room at a time, and are not allowed tokeep pens or pencils in their rooms.[236] According to facilitiesstaff and some girls incarcerated at Tryon, the only difference in theoperation of the sub-facilities is that in the secure portion, the girls'individual cells are locked at night, whereas in the non-secure portion theyare not.[237] Residents in each facilitycannot move about the facility grounds freely. "Privileges," such as a laterbedtime, number of phone calls, and access to a television are meted outaccording to a girl's "stage," with very minor variations across facilitytypes.[238] HRW/ACLU requesteddocuments from OCFS that would verify or contradict these accounts, but ourrequest was denied.[239]Thus,although girls classified as "secure" and "non-secure" at Tryon are segregatedfrom one another, in almost all respects both groups are held in a maximumsecurity environment. Presumably, judges sentencing girls to Tryon Girls ratherthan to Tryon Secure do so because they have determined that placement in ahigh-security environment does not serve their best interests. The maximumsecurity treatment such girls receive not only contravenes internationalstandards but also frustrates the rehabilitative intent of other actors in New York's juvenilejustice system.Internationalstandards require that different degrees of security be available to differentgroups of incarcerated persons according to their needs.[240]The use of security measures beyond what is needed or appropriate for juvenilesis also cause for concern because such measures have a tendency to interferewith children's ability to exercise other rights, such as rights to freeexpression[241]and family contact.[242]Strip SearchesI really didn't like it at all, because they wasdisrespecting my privacy. But I was locked up, so what could I do?[243]Girlsheld at Tryon and Lansingare frequently strip searched and even more frequently pat searched forcontraband and weapons. A pat search consists of staff touching the pockets ofthe child's clothing and asking the child if she has anything concealed.[244] Agency documents describehow a strip search is carried out on girls.[245] The girl is required totake off all of her clothes. The staff member then performs the following:visual examination of mouth;[246]visual examination of the nose and ears;resident runs fingers through her hair and staff visuallyexamines;resident lifts arms to expose armpits to visual examination;visual examination of hands, between fingers, bottom of feetand between toes;resident lifts breasts to expose areas to visual examination;resident separates body folds or creases to expose areas tovisual examination;resident removes any sanitary articles from body or clothing,i.e. tampon, sanitary napkin;resident squats and coughs deeply to dislodge any articlesconcealed in the anus or vagina;resident bends over and spreads the buttocks to expose theanus and vagina to visual examination;staff search of each article of clothing.[247]AliciaK. described a strip search:Most of the time it was in the bathroom. The female staffcame in, you take off all your clothes, you shake out the clothes, they checkthe pockets, you bend down and cough. No one wants to be strip-searched.[248]Girlsdescribed strip searches being performed every time they returned from outsidefacility grounds, and at Tryon, after merely having been transported to theboys' side of the facility for a medical appointment or for any other reason.[249] OCFS policy documentsconfirm this.[250] Strip searches areperformed regardless of how little time was spent away from the facility, andeven though children are always monitored by facilities staff and almost alwayshandcuffed and shackled when they are taken outside facility grounds, althoughtheir handcuffs may later be removed, for example, during a court appearance. Girlsdescribed being strip searched after medical appointments,[251] and Selena B., who was 13when she was held at the paramilitary "L-Unit" at Lansing described being strip searched uponreturning from weekly hiking trips.[252]Devon A., formerly held at the Lansing and Tryon facilities, told HRW/ACLU:You'd get a pat search after eating and a pat in certainclasses. They'd pat search when something was missing. They'd strip you whenyou went across the yard even to the dentist at the boys' side.You getstrip searched any time you have shackles and handcuffs on. It feels like aviolation.[253]Whenasked about the frequency of strip searches, Alicia K. responded: "Monthly atleast. There was a basic routine, a unit search. And anytime something came upmissing, like a pencil or a crochet needle."[254] The girls interviewed didnot report male staff conducting or observing strip searches.TheInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits governments frominflicting degrading treatment on any person.[255] International standardsprohibit both the imposition of excessive security measures on confinedchildren and treatment that is degrading,[256] as well as measures thatcould compromise children's mental health.[257] While strip searches at anytime may be perceived as humiliating or degrading by the child enduring it,international human rights law does not absolutely prohibit strip searches whenthere is a legitimate security need to search for weapons or contraband thatcannot be met through other means, i.e. when there is an individualized reasonto suspect a child may have concealed contraband in a body cavity. The routine andprecautionary use of strip searches for all girls regardless of their securitylevel, in circumstances in which it is unlikely girls may have acquiredcontraband or weapons is inconsistent with international norms.[258]Handcuffing and Shackling of GirlsAt the beginning it bothered me, but there was nothingI could do about it.[259]Accordingto the accounts of incarcerated girls and their lawyers, all children in OCFScustody, regardless of their crime, disciplinary history, or any otherindividual circumstance, routinely are handcuffed and shackled when they aretransported to Family Court, to medical appointments, and at other times whenthey are taken off facilities grounds.[260] This violates OCFS'sregulations, which permit the use of mechanical restraints "only in cases wherea child is uncontrollable and constitutes a serious and evident danger tohimself or others," and during transport only if restraints are "necessary forpublic safety."[261] In addition, and also inapparent violation of its own regulations, OCFS in at least some cases employs restraintbelts and metal boxes fitting over wrist shackles, shortening the distancebetween the handcuffs.[262] In December 2005, New York's Legal AidSociety filed suit challenging the practice of handcuffing and shacklingchildren and of using restraint belts and restraint boxes on children when theyare transported to court.[263] The suit was pending atthis writing.[264]Click to expand ImageA girl is held inhandcuffs, shackles, and a "restraint belt." The chain connecting the handcuffsruns through a metal loop connected to the leather belt fastened around thegirl's waist, further restricting her ability to move. Girls typically are heldin these devices during several hours of transport and while awaiting courthearings.2006 Mie Lewis/HumanRights Watch/ACLUInternationalstandards prohibit the transport of juveniles in conditions that in any waysubject children to hardship or indignity.[265] They also prohibit the useof instruments of restraint outside of "exceptional cases, where all othercontrol methods have been exhausted and failed, and only as explicitlyauthorized and specified by law and regulation," specifically, when a childposes an imminent danger of harm to herself or others.[266] When used, such restraintsmust not "cause humiliation or degradation, and should be used restrictivelyand only for the shortest possible period of time."[267]New York state regulations permit the use ofsuch restraints only when children pose a threat to themselves or others, andduring transport only where there exists a threat to public safety.[268] OCFS practice should bemade consistent with these standards.Sexual AbuseAlthoughOCFS and other New York child welfare agencies are occasionally the subject ofscandals involving the sexual abuse and exploitation of children in their care,[269]it is difficult to gauge the extent of such abuse occurring in the facilitiesbecause of girls' understandable reluctance to discuss such issues, combinedwith OCFS's refusal to release even partial or redacted reports of abuse. Availableevidence suggests that incarcerated girls are more commonly targeted for sexualabuse than their male counterparts.[270]HRW/ACLUinterviewed one girl, Ebony V., who was repeatedly sexually abused at the Lansing facility when shewas held there in late 2002 and later at a non-secure residential facility. EbonyV. stated that girls at Lansingknown to have previously been commercially sexually exploited, as she was, are atrisk of being targeted by male staff members. When asked to describe thistargeting, Ebony V., who was 16 at the time of her incarceration, described theconduct of male staff, including her abuser, who was her facility-assignedcounselor:The male staff would flirt with me, like [the abuser].[The abuser] continually made me repeat my story in detail, he made me dothings I did to them to him. He said what I was I would always be that. When Isaid: "I'm going home, I'm not doing this anymore." He said "You like doingthis, you like having sex."[271]Thetargeting of previously sexually exploited girls was also observed by Janine Y.,who was not herself sexually abused. When asked whether staff flirted withgirls, Janine Y. replied:At Tryon [Reception] one staff did, because some of thegirls were in there for like prostitution and stuff. . . . Most of the ones[girls] who got reported for doing stuff with the staff were like prostitutesor strippers.[272]Theincreased vulnerability of previously exploited girls to abuse within juvenilefacilities may arise from factors in addition to targeting by staff. In writtentestimony concerning sexual abuse of adult women prisoners by guards, TerryKupers, a psychiatrist who specializes in prisoner's mental health, explained:Women prisoners, because of the level of sexual andphysical abuse in their backgrounds and their resulting psychological make-up,are less able than many other women to know when their boundaries are beingviolated or they are being harassed or disrespected. Often this is because theyremain confused about who was responsible for the sexual assaults in theirpast. (Children tend to think that the bad things that happen to them are theirown fault.) Because of early and repeated boundary violations, usuallyinvolving the people they should have been able to trust (for instance a fatheror close male relative), because of the resulting guilt, confusion anddiminished self-esteem, and because of a lack of confidence that a man in aposition of power might heed their wishes or commands, they do not have theconfidence to give a clear message to halt in the early stages of an evolvingsexual assault, privacy invasion or violation of bodily integrity-for examplewhen a male officer makes a lewd or infantilizing comment or conducts aninappropriately sexualized pat search. Rather, they are just as likely topartially dissociate, become passive and let the abuse develop without angrilyprotesting. The offending staff take this as a signal, not of consent, butrather that this woman is unlikely to submit a grievance or sound an alarm whenhe assaults her, and consequently he may more confidently continue to makedemeaning comments or move ahead with the evolving sexual assault.[273]EbonyV. continues her account of her experiences in the Lansing facility:It was very exploitative in there. I was living betterthan I was on the street but I was still living street life in there. I wasstill being sexually exploited by the staff there. A staff member had sex withme. . . . When I was there, it was at least three of us. And before I camethere, he was on it. . . . Even when I was in there, he was under investigationfor inappropriate behavior with girls on the unit.[274]Whenasked about the facility's response to the abuse, Ebony V. stated that she didnot report her abuse to other staff, but that the abuser was investigated forhaving sex with another girl:He wasn't allowed to counsel us with the door closed, butthat was just for about two weeks. But once the investigation ended he wentback to counseling us with the door closed. They said he was not guilty. . . .The state protects their staff. So it's hard to convict him of anything.[275]Whenasked how the staff person was able to isolate her, Ebony V. replied:He was the YDC.[276]So when girls would make collect calls, they did it from his office. Or, ifyou're going home or had problems with anyone in the unit, you spoke tohim.. . .[During the day,] he'dcome pick me up from the lunchroom. He was allowed to take me back alone whilethe other staff and residents were in the cafeteria. He took me back to theunit and had sex with me. [At night,] most of the time we went to theschoolhouse right next door to the unit or we went to his office and said I hadto make a phone call.[277]Whenasked whether any other staff were aware of her abuse, Ebony V. replied:We got caught one time by another YDA[278]from another unit. The way the office was set up, [the abuser's] office had twodoors. He was leaning against the front door, the guy came in the back door. Hesaid: "Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm sorry" andclosed the door. It's crazy, isn't it?[279]Byfailing to intervene or report the abuse, the YDA violated his duty under statelaw as a mandated reporter of child abuse. When asked why she herself had notreported the abuse, Ebony V. replied:I was 16, I needed attention. At that time my body hadbeen through so much trauma that it didn't matter. Having sex with me was thesame as loving me.[280]Courtrecords describe a similar case at Tryon in 2001, in which a girl, Silvia N.,was approached by her facility-assigned mentor as she left a bathroom,undressed, and taken back into the bathroom where they had sex. As she puts it,she "was surprised" but did not file a complaint.[281]After a second, similar, incident, Silvia N. became pregnant. Silvia N. thenattempted to contact the facility director but the director "didn't come towork and didn't get the letter right." Later, Silvia N.'s mother called thefacility and reported what had happened.[282]Courtrecords describe another alleged sexual assault at Tryon occurring in late2002. Sandra Z. was 15 years old when, according to court pleadings, a YouthDivision Aide (YDA) sexually assaulted her on six occasions in a common area ofthe facility during the evening when the YDA was on duty and other residentswere confined to their rooms.[283]Sandra Z. alleges that on the first two occasions, the YDA touched her breastor breasts, on the second two occasions, he touched her vaginal area, and onthe last two occasions, he had sexual intercourse with her. Sandra Z. made an"internal complaint" about the abuse. Of the five criminal charges broughtagainst him, the YDA pled guilty to Official Misconduct.[284]SandraZ. alleges, among other things, that OCFS acted negligently, recklessly, andcarelessly by failing to properly screen, train, and supervise its employees,to take proper precautions against the YDA, who had "entered into ameretricious relationship[] with one or more infant residents," and for failingto terminate or investigate the YDA when it "knew or should have known" of hisrelationships with girls at Tryon. OCFS denies Sandra Z.'s allegations.Accordingto interviewed girls and facilities records, sexual abuse short of intercourseoccurs at the facilities. For example, facility records from Tryon describeallegations by a child of "kissing, hugging, touching and sexual contact"between a child and a staff member.[285]Another report describes the suspension of a staff member for "emailing [a girl]while she was in the community. . . It is also alleged that [the staff member]met [the girl] in the community and he gave her his cell phone number, e-mailaddress and home address. [The girl] further alleged that they have contactedeach other on several occasions via e-mails and cell phone."[286] Other allegation of sexualcontact are noted in facility reports.[287]DevonA., who was incarcerated between the ages of 15 and 17, described herobservations while held at Tryon:Staff would really get into the kids' sex lives. They'dstart a conversation about kids' sex lives. One girl kissed a staff and then herestrained her. I guess their talking went a little too far. He restrained herso bad she defecated on herself.[288]It was in the hallway where our rooms are at. There was a lot of ongoinginvestigations, but they came up not guilty or inconclusive, because nobodywould snitch.[289]FeliciaH. described flirtatious behavior by staff: "The staff like playing with theirhands too much with the females. They'll play-fight, or chase us around or putketchup or paint on our clothes. They'll call you 'ugly' and 'fat-ass,' that'show they flirt."[290]Wendy M., who had been held at Tryon Reception and other state and localfacilities said:All over at every facility, staff flirts with girls. Theyhave side conversations, they treat them better. They ask things like, have youever had sex? How did it feel? The girls can't do nothing about it, because ifyou complain, you'll be overruled.[291]Girls'grievances also suggest that staff sexually harass girls. One grievance reads:Grieving the fact that she feels like she was beingdisrespected by [name redacted]. One day at the Gym, they were playing "Batman"and he had spanked her in the butt with a racket and she feels uncomfortable.She feels he is taking advantage. She wants [this] to be looked into and notignored.[292]Otherexamples of sexual talk include a staff person telling a girl that "she likesto be touched by men,"[293]or to "stop walking the way she is walkingbecause she is not on the strip."[294]Grievance records also indicate that male staff aresometimes present in the housing area when girls are showering, dressing aftera shower, or changing their clothes. One girl complained that when one male andone female staff member are on duty, the male staff member watches the showers.[295]Other complaints suggest that male staff in the housing area are required toannounce "man in hall," but that sometimes they do not, catching girls bysurprise while they are undressed. One girl complained of a male staff member,"residents would be getting dressed, but he just says 'I won't look.'"[296]Accordingto grievance logs, peer-on-peer sexual harassment appears to occur at thefacilities,[297]and as to some grievances it is not possible to tell whether the harassment isbeing carried out by a staff member or another girl because names have beenredacted and the entries contain no gendered pronoun referring to theperpetrator. For example, one grievance from Lansing reads: "[name redacted] is touchingher, slapped her butt, and made comments about chest."[298]Several such ambiguous grievances are present in the logs obtained by HRW/ACLU.Other complaints are vague, stating only that a child feels unsafe oruncomfortable in the presence of a staff member, or are exceedingly terse.[299]Thesexual abuse and harassment present in the facilities are likely to poseparticular risks to the psychological well-being of incarcerated girls becauseof the high rate of sexual abuse in their pasts. The emotional impact of abuseat the facilities is suggested in a grievance entry which reads: "Is angry,flashbacks, cannot sleep, [name redacted] has come in when she/other peersshowering. She feels unsafe with him,"[300]and another which reads: "grieving [name redacted] and his inappropriatecomments. She feels he is a pervert especially watching showers and is havingnightmares about it."[301]Available evidence suggests girls who have suffered sexual abuse prior to theirincarceration are not only more vulnerable to abuse within facilities but alsomore likely to be retraumatized by such abuse and harassment. In his testimonyconcerning sexual assault against adult women prisoners, Dr. Terry Kupersstated:When male officers treat women with disrespect it has adifferent impact than having women officers act disrespectfully to maleprisoners. Disrespect towards women by male officers is more likely to besexual in content or implication, and in women who were traumatized by sexualabuse perpetrated by males, it is more likely to be experienced as a"retraumatization." . . . Of course, in a prison setting, the picture is muchmore complicated and the possible sequelae are much more severe. The woman whois sexually harassed (for instance experiencing prurient and inappropriateobservation or pat searches), assaulted or raped remains imprisoned in the samesetting where the assaultive conduct occurred, and absent a complaint beingsustained and the officer being terminated, the same officer who committed thetraumatizing acts remains in total control of the woman.Even if there is no grievable sexual misconduct, the merepresence of male officers in the housing units where the women toilet, shower,undress and sleep can constitute a retraumatization. The deprivation of privacythat is inherent in incarceration becomes much more of a deprivation than isnecessary to accomplish the proper goals of incarceration. Previouslytraumatized women who might choose to avoid the gaze of males in order tocreate a safe place are forced to live in a situation where male officers areconstantly present and might intrude on their most personal and privateactivities at any moment. The woman can develop a generalized fear, and thissituation is quite likely to make her symptoms and disability worse and morelong-lasting.[302]Muchof the physical abuse and almost all of the sexual abuse described byincarcerated girls appears to be perpetrated by male staff,[303]raising concerns about the supervision of girls' housing units by male staff.HRW/ACLU has been informed that OCFS policy requires that there be at least twostaff members on each unit at all times, but at least one resident has allegedthat her unit was left supervised by only one staff member.[304]Grievance logs contain specific requests by girls not to be left alone withmale staff, or for female staff to be assigned.[305]It appears that OCFS administrators have previously considered "gender-basedstaffing" to address the problem of sexual relationships between girls andstaff, but details of such discussions were withheld from HRW/ACLU.[306]Internationalstandards prohibit the supervision of female inmates by male staff.[307]Implementing such a policy in the housing areaof girls' facilities could decrease the incidence of sexual abuse in OCFSfacilities, as well as the incidence of extreme use of force. OCFS's refusal torelease documents to HRW/ACLU relating to sexual abuse makes evaluation of thefacilities' response to individual allegations difficult.[308]Yet the allegations of both physical and sexual abuse at the Lansing and Tryonfacilities points to failures of screening, training, and supervision, as wellas the lack of oversight of the facilities by outside monitors.Thepractices reported here run contrary to the United States' international legal obligations.In July 2006, the UN Committee Against Torture, an international body ofexperts, for the first time evaluated U.S. policies on imprisonment and concludedthat, among other things, the U.S. needed to "design and implement appropriate measures to prevent all sexual violence"against incarcerated persons. The U.S. was called on to ensure thatallegations are investigated promptly and independently, perpetrators areprosecuted, and appropriately sentenced and victims can seek redress, includingappropriate compensation.[309]Collective PunishmentSeveralgirls interviewed by HRW/ACLU complained of collective punishment. The mostcommon complaint concerned what is known as "retraining." As Devon A. put it,"If five, six, or seven kids do something, you [the unit of approximately 20girls] go on 'retraining.' They're very strict, they follow all theprocedures."[310]According to Felicia H., retraining consists of each girl being required tospend a substantial part of each day sitting on a chair placed in front of thedoor to her room. Girls may do nothing other than study the facility rulebook.Girls must take the rulebook with them wherever they go within the facility.During "retraining," girls must also attend meetings to discuss the misbehaviorthat has occurred.[311]Girlssubjected to retraining said they resented being held accountable for others'bad behavior. Girls also complained that they were not taken off retrainingeven though they exhibited good behavior.Collectivepunishment contravenes the principle that a penalty should be imposed onan individual only for actions that he or she personally committed. Group punishment, defined aspunishment "solely on account of the behavior or acts of other children" isprohibited under New YorkState regulations.[312]Internationalstandards also specifically prohibit collectively punishing incarceratedchildren.[313]Verbal and Psychological AbuseVerbalabuse by facilities staff takes several forms. According to both interviewedgirls and grievance records, staff sometimes threaten girls with physicalviolence. Wendy M., who was 16 when interviewed and who had been held inseveral pre- and post-adjudication facilities, including Tryon Reception, forover 4 years, gave as examples of such statements:"I'm gonna fuck you up,""I'm gonna whoop your ass," and "I'm gonnaput your lights out."[314]A staff member at Tryon told a girl that he would "knock her teeth out."[315]Several girls complained that staff threatened them with the restraintprocedure.[316]For example, one girl said she felt threatened by a male staff member becausehe told her that he "[felt] a restraint coming on."[317]Inaddition, facilities staff sometimes curse and raise their voices at girls.Grievance records contain complaints of girls being called names such as"asshole," "idiots," "slow," "thug," "bitch,""cry-baby," "witch," "stupid," "ignorant," "little bastards,""nobody," and "lazy" and for being "screamed"at, "cursed" at, "yelled" at, told to "shut the fuck up," and "insulted."[318]A girl confined in Lansingwas told by a staff member that "I'm nothing, won't do nothing, and I'm aboutnothing."[319]Many girls complained of being told to "shut up," and generally to beingtreated disrespectfully. Some girls said they felt as if they were treated likea "dog" or "animal," or not "as human but as if slaves."[320]Girlsalso reported being taunted and provoked by staff to fight with their peers.Wendy M. said, "Staff would purposely get in my face, because they knew I hadan anger management problem. They knew because they saw my records."[321]Another girl complained, with respect to oneof her peers, that the staff "are repeatedly telling her to fight them soshe'll be put in jail[She d]oes not want staff to push her."[322]Another girl complained that a male staff member was "calling her a pussybecause she will not fight another peer. She wants him to stop making commentsthat make her upset."[323]Yet another girl complained of a staff person "telling residents that theyshould fight."[324]OCFS did not provide HRW/ACLU with material indicating the extent to which facilitiesstaff are disciplined for verbally abusing or taunting residents. We wereprovided one letter of reprimand that reveals a staff person was fined fortelling a child, "Your breath smells like pussy, you need a tic tac."[325]Violations of Privacy[Staff members]shout them out, say private things about them. They said, "you know you'reburning." That meant, you have a disease, like HIV or Chlamydia.[326]Bothinterviewed girls and reviewed grievance logs reveal a widespread practiceamong facilities staff of disclosing residents' private information to otherresidents. The disclosed information consists of details of residents' medicaland mental health conditions such as a diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections,medication, past abuse including sexual exploitation, family problems, and bedwetting. The evidence suggests that staff members sometimes revealed residents'private information to others when they were angry with the resident, but morecommonly without apparent reason.Grievancelogs consistently contain entries in which girls complain that theirconfidentiality was violated. Some entries read:[Name redacted] is grieving that staff in Unit 53 isthrowing the fact that she was abused in her faceWould like her personalbusiness away from peers.[327][N]urse told peer she asked for an HIV [t]est[328][Name redacted] is grieving the fact that [name redacted]allows other residents to file residents' portfolios. Feels other residentsshouldn't have access to this personal information.[329][Name redacted] is grieving [name redacted] as residentstates that YDA[330]bribes residents w/information and tells residents personal information aboutother residents.[331][N]urse told personal business in front of staff, blameeverything on rape [illegible].[332][D]isclosed personal business in front of unit.[333]EbonyV., 16 at the time of her incarceration, had been subjected to commercialsexual exploitation and incarcerated under a charge of prostitution. This waswidely known among staff members, but Ebony V. nevertheless felt ashamed when astaff member remarked on it in the presence of other residents:Sometimes, if the YDA gets mad, they say it in front ofthe others: "You don't want to go back to where you were now, do you?" They tryto embarrass you.[334]Confined children still enjoy their right to privacyas guaranteed both under U.S.law and U.S.human rights obligations, although the right may be subject to somerestrictions inherent in the fact of incarceration.[335] International standardsrequire facilities staff to respect children's right to privacy, andspecifically forbid staff from disseminating private information about childrenlearned in the course of their duties.[336]Girlsat Lansing alsocomplain that they are not allowed to keep a journal or are prevented fromwriting in their journal when they please, or that theirjournal is read by staff or confiscated.[337]These seemingly small restrictions are very significant limitations on girlswho because of their incarceration already have limited scope for a privatelife and for self-expression. It is important that the environment within juvenilefacilities should promote and support children's capacity for generalself-development in a manner that facilitates their intellectual independence.[338]DiscriminationDiscrimination andHarassment against Lesbian and Gender Nonconforming GirlsThe exact number of lesbian, bisexual, and transgendergirls incarcerated in the Lansing and Tryon facilities is not known. Oneestimate places the percentage of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youthin the New YorkState juvenile justice system as a wholeat 4 to 10 percent, and this may provide a rough gauge.[339]In addition, it appears that some girls who would not ordinarily identify as gayform romantic bonds with other girls when confined in single-sex environments.[340]Whenasked whether she was aware of gay relationships while incarcerated, Alicia K.,who was held at Tryon Reception and then at Tryon Secure for 7 to 8 months whenshe was 15 years old, then sent twice to Lansingwhen she was 16 and 17 years old, said, "That was common. It was like breathingair in there." Facilities records confirm that such relationships exist.[341] When asked whether sexoccurred between residents, however, Alicia K. responded, "That was pretty muchimpossible, because staff was always around. It was mostly letter writing."[342]Selena B. confirmed that in the facilities "going out" means, "Talking,writing, and stuff."[343]Thus the treatment of girls in the facilities identified as lesbian appears tospring less from the enforcement of rules against sexual activity than the propensityto single out certain girls for harsh treatment because of their perceivedsexual or gender identity or their nonconformity to gender norms. Devon A., whois lesbian and who was held at Tryon and Lansing between when she was 15 and 17years old, told HRW/ACLU:If you're gay they think you think you're a man, so theyrestrain you harder. They have an attitude of "If you want to be a man, I'llrestrain you like a man." That place [Lansing]was unstable. I was restrained ten or twelve times.[344]SelenaB., a straight girl who had been held at Tryon Reception and Lansing, saidabout gay girls in the facilities:They had to hide out, or they'd get in trouble. They'dget extensions of placement. That was at Tryon [Reception] and Lansing.[345]Non-sexualbehavior, such as letter writing between girls or blowing kisses is punished ifit is perceived as lesbian.[346]Some girls reported that "special relationships" among residents are punishedand can result in an "extension of placement," juvenile justice parlance for anincrease in a child's sentence.[347]Devon A. said she was subjected to room confinement for being lesbian:At LansingI was restrained because I was gay, they couldn't trust me. If I was talking toanother girl, they'd think something sexual was happening. Once I was put onisolation for two weeks, they thought I was getting too close to a female. It'snot fun because there's no rec [free] time, it's supposed to be mandatory butyou can't even interact with your peers. That made me feel real depressed.[348]Girls'accounts of discrimination and harassment based on gender identity areconsistent with the findings of a 2001 report on the experiences of gay,bisexual, and transgender youth in the New York juvenile justice system,[349]which concluded that the lack of policies protecting LGBT youth, combined withthe lack of expertise among adults working with LGBT youth results in verbaland physical harassment of such youth by staff and peers.[350]Given the strict sex segregation maintained in the facilities, punishing girlsperceived as lesbian for speaking to and otherwise communicating with othergirls essentially guarantees the targeted girl's social isolation.Racial DiscriminationSomegirls also reported incidents of racial discrimination. Asked how she liked thestaff at Tryon Reception, Miranda N. replied:Some were friendly, really there was only one staff thatno one liked because she was racist. She was white. She called girls "nigger."She made jokes. Once in the cafeteria the lights cut out by mistake. She said"when you cut out the lights I could only see 20 eyeballs, can't see any kids."[351]Onegrievance from Tryon reads: "Grieving [name redacted]. Picks on her calling herwhite cracker & everyone laughs."[352]Other grievances appear to relate to discrimination of some kind but are tooabbreviated to provide a clear understanding of what occurred.[353]"Our Kids Can't Act Like That"The Missouri Model of Juvenile CorrectionalFacilitiesAmidthe seemingly inevitable realities of NewYork's existing juvenile justice system, it isoften difficult for both officials and reformers alike to imagine anythingother than the status quo. According to reports, however, for over 20 years,juvenile facilities in the State of Missourihave pursued a sincere commitment to juvenile rehabilitation that disposeswith corrections convention in favor of a higher quality of life forresidents coupled with some of the lowest recidivism rates in the country.[354]Thesystem, referred to as the Missouri Model, took shape in the late 1970s asthe establishment of smaller facilities was slowly joined by a new approachto staffing and a working philosophy genuinely stressing treatment overpunishment. From the outset, smaller, region-specific facilities ensured thatresidents were never too far from their homes. In these smaller groupsettings residents are far more likely to receive the specialized attentionessential to rehabilitation.[355]Accordingto Mark Steward, former director of Missouri's Division of Youth Services andone the primary architects of the Missouri Model, a state can only fullyrealize the benefits of the small facility model when those staff-residentrelationships are of a high quality. Steward said in an interview withHRW/ACLU that this starts with a uniquely equipped and caring staff composedof college-degreed individuals with a level of ethnic diversity reflective ofthe children in their care.[356]Within the facilities, both residents and staff are individually accountablefor the personal relationships they forge while in residence, offering anorganic solution for both resident behavioral issues and the staff apathy andturnover that characterize larger facilities. To Steward, controlling staffmakeup is essential for a staff-resident relationship that steers clear ofthe correctional-style interactions that dominate the juvenile justiceexperience in other states.Stewardstresses that severing any philosophical or bureaucratic link betweenjuvenile and adult corrections is a necessary first step in moving from a juvenilejustice system that is an idle repository for rejected children to a refugefor kids who warrant renewed investment from their communities andgovernments. Often, says Steward, the transformation requires awakening asystem and its politicians to the realization that "these kids are notdemons."[357]Thischange of mindset is made easier when policymakers realize that theinvestment required by the Missouri Model is a question of attitude andtechnique, not a matter of increased financial investment. The smallerresident populations are divided into 9- to 11-member "teams" in which eachchild and staff member is authorized to initiate impromptu rehabilitativediscussions and therapy sessions and any child can call the entire teamtogether in a "circle" for a discussion at any point during the day.[358]These sessions allow residents to explore the underlying sources of turmoilin their lives, whether family history or bodily trauma. Physical andmechanical restraints are almost nonexistent in the Missouri Model; rather,when a conflict threatens to escalate, residents form a "trust circle," asimultaneous embrace of team members that calms residents whose outburstsendanger the group.TheMissouri Model also requires a complete rejection of the opaqueness characteristicof the New Yorksystem and instead a simple commitment to outside oversight throughout alllevels of administration. In Steward's view, abuses and neglect are simplyless likely to happen in an "open system." In Missouri, active advisory boards reviewfacilities practices and "liaison councils" bring legislators and otherofficials into facilities to interact with residents. In another measure toincrease openness, Missourihas situated its facilities in uniquely visible and social environs, such asplacing a girls' facility on an active college campus where residentsregularly dine with the student population.[359]These measures simultaneously reduce the likelihood of abuse and increasepublic understanding of residents and the challenges they face.Lookingahead, Steward predicts that the most significant barrier to Missouri-stylechange in a situation like New York'smay be on the agency level. "A lot of people [within the agencies] say,'Well, our kids can't act like that,'" laments Steward.[360]The challenge ahead rests equally on the shoulders of administrators,legislators, and advocates to ensure that, while this state's most troubledchildren may not be identical to Missouri's, New York's juvenile justicesystem can indeed "act like that" and realize some of the lessons of theMissouri Model.IV. Conditions of Confinement: InadequateEducational OpportunitiesHRW/ACLU'sresearch uncovered a number of areas in which facilities' educational offeringsare deficient. Girls receive no schooling during the first two weeks of theirincarceration. Many girls told us that a shortage of qualified staff combinedwith the grouping in a single classroom of girls of widely differenteducational levels and needs deprives them of necessary individualizedinstruction. The vocational training offered to girls embodies archaic genderstereotypes and does not measure up to what is offered to boys. Barriers togirls' transition back to regular schools upon their release from OCFSfacilities adds an additional educational handicap.Itshould be noted that, according to one New Yorkeducation expert, many children feel that the education they receive in OCFSfacilities is better than that provided in some New York City schools, because the classesare smaller and children feel that the teachers care more about them.[361] Although, in the expert'sopinion, OCFS "could be doing a better job," its schools and aftercare servicescompare favorably to city schools, where the special education program inparticular is "broken."[362] The accounts below in partcontradict this rosy picture, at least with respect to Lansing and Tryon. Buteven assuming it is accurate, it says more about the failures of the New York City schoolsystem than about OCFS facilities. It should certainly not be cause forcomplacency.SchoolingWhena girl is remanded to OCFS custody, she is discharged from the public school inwhich she was enrolled.[363]OCFS is then responsible for providing the girl with an education.[364]As of 2003, there were 1,709 boys and girls in OCFS schools.[365]Duringthe first two weeks of their incarceration, girls do not receive schooling.They are placed initially at TryonReceptionCenterto receive assessments to determine in which facility they will ultimately beheld, and in addition are provided "group" sessions on such topics as HIVawareness, drug use, and aggression, as well as some physical exercise. Noformal education takes place at TryonReceptionCenter,and for much of the two-week period, girls are left alone and idle in cells. Manygirls say the group sessions they attend are of little educational value.According to Miranda N., such sessions consisted of "watching movies from Lifetime."[366]When asked about the counseling offered to her, Stephanie Q., now 18, replied:They have this whole wellness criteria, a wellness group.Like dealing with aggression. . . . It didn't help, because it's common sense.You know that automatically. Most of the people [incarcerated] there are smart.But if you look at the stuff, most of it is dumb, they just want to fill up theschedule.[367]Girls placed at Lansingand Tryon attend facilities-operated schools on facility grounds. At Tryon,school consists of small classes of ten or twenty students, depending onwhether half a unit or an entire unit is placed in a class together, and thereis generally one teacher per class.[368]Incarcerated girls range in age from twelve to nineteen and exhibit a widerange of educational abilities.[369]Some girls enter the facilities with a high level of educational aptitude andachievement and the ambition of earning a high school diploma and going tocollege, while others have very limited reading ability, special educationalneeds, and may have been out of school for long periods of time.[370]Incarcerated children with learning disabilities have the right to specializededucational services administered according to individualized educational plans(IEPs).[371]Forall girls, the education offered at the Lansing and Tryon facilities isdeficient, primarily because the facilities' schools lack the qualified staffnecessary both to provide the scope of classes offered at regular schools andto provide the individualized attention many students need.[372]Girls of different grade levels are lumped together and frequently asked to studyindependently from a book or a worksheet without the help of a teacher. Thisarrangement compromises the educational progress both of girls withindividualized educational needs, who complain that they do not receive enoughindividual attention to allow them to learn,[373]and those with stronger educational backgrounds, particularly older teenagers,who express frustration at being under-challenged in the facilities' schools.Ofschool at Tryon, Devon A., who was held in OCFS facilities between the ages of15 and 17, said:It was a regular school, but it wasn't up to par. Theatmosphere of the school wasn't real, the work was kindergarten, first gradetype stuff. Like "What's 13 times 2?" I was a pre-GED student. They didn't havethe materials. I felt very bored. I took the GED at Tryon and passed.[374]Ofschool at Lansing,Ebony V., who was 16 at the time of her incarceration, said:School was a setup. They teach you all this kindergartenor easy work. You'll come back in the world and not be able to survive inregular schools. Part of school was crochet! Come on, we're fourteen, fifteen,sixteen years old, that should not be part of our curriculum. I think it wasevery day, a significant amount of time was crochet, beading, or makingblankets to sell.[375]Severalother girls expressed frustration at what they view as thelowest-common-denominator approach taken by the facilities schools. Some girls feltthat the primary aim of schooling at the facilities is to prepare girls for theGED,[376]rather than preparing them to reenter and eventually graduate from regular highschools. One grievance reads: "Has been here ten months and has not gotten herproper studies to help her for her regents exam."[377]Indeed, residents sometimes do not receive homework or are barred from takingwork out of the classroom.[378]An emphasis on the GED over high school graduation denies children not only achoice but a right: New YorkState law requires thatevery child be offered the opportunity to earn a high school diploma, and theright to schooling continues until a child earns a diploma or turns 21.[379]Inaddition to the lack of appropriate and individualized instruction, otheroccasional factors interfere with girls' ability to gain an education at thefacilities. Grievance logs contain complaints that teaching vacancies remain unfilled,teachers do not come to class or come late, girls are woken up late for schoolby staff, girls are not told what grade level they are in or are placed in thewrong grade level, and there are not enough books for the girls to read.[380]According to facility records, although theTryon facility has some computers, they were malfunctioning and not usable fora period of over a month in 2005.[381]Thegenerally poor quality of facilities schools may be attributable in part to anapparent absence of outside monitoring. The New York State Department ofEducation is responsible for monitoring OCFS schools,[382]yet when in the course of litigation the Department of Education was asked forits most recent reviews of schooling at Lansing and Tryon, the departmentturned over reports dating back to the late 1990s.[383]Although its datedness renders its current value slight, a review ofeducational programs in the Lansingfacility consisting of inspections in 1996 and 1998 found "problems of aserious nature," specifically incomplete and poorly maintained IndividualEducation Programs for special education students, a dysfunctional andineffective Committee on Special Education, and teaching-related inadequacies.[384]Children may also face administrative barriers whenthey are released from OCFS facilities and attempt to transition back intocommunity schools. The nature and extent of such barriers is not clear, and OCFSdid not return phone calls from HRW/ACLU seeking to verify allegations in thisregard,[385]but New York City Department of Education statistics indicating that two-thirdsof high school-age children leaving custody do not return to regular schoolssuggest that the barriers are substantial.[386]This problem is at issue in a pending class action lawsuit brought by formerlycourt-involved children against the NewYork City and State Departments of Education.[387] According to other sources,children leaving OCFS facilities are sometimes faced with unnecessarydifficulty in reintegrating into regular schools because of the nature of theclasses and credits awarded at facilities schools, combined with failure ofcoordination between OCFS and the city education departments, specifically, theabsence of a memorandum of understanding governing the relationship betweenOCFS and the New York City Departments of Education.[388]Another possible barrier may be that OCFS high schools are not registered withthe State of New York and, as a consequence, the principal of a school a childwishes to enter upon her release from OCFS has discretion to determine whether sheis to receive credits for her past work.[389]The determination as to how many credits a student is permitted to transfer is"complicated by the fact that the student may have attended multiple schools,not completed a full semester of coursework, or have taken courses that do notsatisfy graduation requirements."[390]According to OCFS literature "general education" consisting of a corecurriculum and electives is provided to children held at Tryon and Lansing inaddition to "remedial education" and "special education."[391]OCFS literature states that its electives are "comparable or equivalent toapproved syllabi established by the NYS Education Department," but does notmake a similar claim for its core curriculum.[392]Someformerly incarcerated children report experiencing difficulty in transferringthe credits earned in facility schools to regular high school. When Alicia K.was asked whether she was able to transfer her credits out of Tryon, sheanswered:They transferred, but some of the grades and credits getlost between me coming home. I tried to contact the principal, but they nevergot back to me. I tried at least once a week for two months and my guidancecounselor tried also. That's what I'm trying to patch up now. That's why Idon't know if I will be able to graduate this year.[393]Accordingto one service provider at a non-residential facility, educational programmingat all OCFS facilities has suffered under recent changes in agency policy:It used to be a lot more of a therapeutic environment. .. . But now the state is mandating uniformity across facilities, so each has tohave same things going on, the same standards are applied, and ACA [AmericanCorrectional Association] accreditation is considered more important thanprogram[s] for the girls. It's obvious that they [the facilities] are reallystrapped for providing education and any additional programming. . .They'remore concerned with the punishing aspects, like restraining girls.[394]Under international standards, all children have theright to an education.[395]Incarcerated children, in particular, have a right to programs, includingeducation and vocational training, calculated to help them achieve "sociallyconstructive and productive roles in society."[396]As to the type of programs to be provided, research on girls counsels"strength-based," as opposed to "deficit-based" educational programming. Thisphilosophy coincides with the standard in international law that children's educationbe directed to the development of children's "personality, talents and mental and physical abilitiesto their fullest potential . . . ."[397]The United Nations Rules governing juvenile facilities also stress theprovision of quality education in facilities so that children may continue topursue their education without difficulty upon release.[398]Vocational TrainingRecognizingthe importance of vocational training in equipping girls for economic survivalupon their release, international standards relating to juvenile facilitiesrequire that girls be offered vocational opportunities.[399]The paucity of vocational programs for girls in the Lansing and Tryonfacilities, the barriers to accessing such programs even when they are offered,and the nature of the training offered are all matters of serious concern.InDecember 2005, when attorneys from NewYork's Legal Aid Society visited the girls' units atTryon, no vocational classes were being offered.[400]The Tryon facility has a culinary arts classroom but at the time of the visit theteacher had left and had not been replaced and the room stood idle.[401]Likewise, a former resident at Lansing said thatthe facility has a classroom for a cosmetology class, equipped with chairs,sinks, mannequin heads, and the like, but that during the time that she washeld at Lansingthe classroom was never used.[402]Evenwhen vocational training is offered, it may not be offered widely or it may besubject to prohibitive administrative prerequisites. This appears to be true ofwhat at Lansingis called "OJT" or "On the Job Training," which consists of either working inthe kitchen helping to prepare meals for residents or acting as a teacher'saide. Selena B., previously held at Lansing,said that she and a few other girls were allowed to perform OJT in the kitchen.[403]Alicia K. wanted to work as a teacher's aide but she was thwarted by ruleslimiting girls' eligibility for the position, and by the fact that demand forsuch positions far outstripped supply:You have to go through so much. The unit staff has toagree. You also have to be at least at adjustment stage,[404]and you need signatures from the teachers, and you need good grades, and atleast thirty days of good behavior. And then there's a waiting list. There arelots of people on it. Within Tryon Girls everyone, once they hit adjustmentstage after three months, signs up to be a teacher's aide. You had to wait forsomeone to leave.[405]Evenwhen classes are offered and are, as a practical matter, available to girls atthe facilities, the educational value of the classes appears to bequestionable. For example, Lansingoffers what it calls a "Career Class." When asked what she learned in theclass, a former resident said, "Nothing really. They give you a book and tellyou to do worksheets. They ask you to define 'part time' and 'internship' andstuff."[406]A provider of vocational services in a non-secure girls' facility complainedthat the job readiness curriculum provided by the state is unrealistic,employing examples such as "Johnny has a paper route," rather than realisticcontemporary urban scenarios.[407]According to the provider, a more useful curriculum would include how to readwant ads, information about legal and illegal questions potential employers mayask, job search strategies, and the social skills, often absent in girls whohave been institutionalized for most of their lives, necessary to find and keepa job.[408]The vocational training offered may also beproblematic to the extent that the type of training given to girls is based ongender stereotypes and is for jobs that are of less economic value than thejobs for which boys are trained. Tryon ostensibly offers a "culinary artsvocational program," a "cosmetology vocational program," and an "office skillsvocational program."[409]The basis for OCFS's choice of cooking, hairdressing, and clerical work as itsvocational offerings is unclear, but does not appear to rest on researchindicating that these fields offer the most viable and lucrative career optionsfor young women, and may in addition perpetuate stereotyped cultural roles.[410]Thevocational training offered to girls also appears to be vastly inferior to thatoffered to boys. As described above, a significant amount of time at thefacilities is apparently spent on crochet, beading, or making blankets.[411]In contrast, the boys facility atTryon and other boys facilities across the state offer a range of vocationalclasses including "auto shop, culinary arts, sewing, typing/word processing anda computer distance learning center that uses 'Safety Net,' a web basededucational program for incarcerated youth."[412]Boys at the Louis Gossett facility across the street from Lansing receive training in culinary arts,the building trades, automobile repair, building maintenance and propertymanagement, merchandising management, and office skills.[413]Similar courses are offered at TryonBoysResidentialCenter, located withinthe same complex as Tryon's girls' units, where vocational offerings includethe above as well as a "career and financial management" class where studentslearn "job acquisition skills andhow to take care of your funds."[414]Each vocational class employs "hands-on"instruction facilitated by the extensive useof specialized equipment and staff training.[415]Auto shop is at Tryon is taught in a replica of a "genuine Midas auto shop."[416]Similar facilities exist or are planned at other boys' facilities where boyspractice their skills on donated cars.[417]Although boys at the Gossett facility are initially assignedto one or another vocational program, boys' requests to transfer to a differentclass are frequently granted, providing them with some freedom to pursue theirindividual interests.[418]In addition, all but two of the semester-long courses at Gossett providepassing students with a marketable national certification. Because each courseis only a few months long, boys often leave Gossett with two or morecertifications.[419]In addition to vocational classes, which meet three times per week, boys atGossett attend a weekly "job readiness class" to prepare their employment"portfolios."[420]Regardless of which program they ultimately complete, however, incarceratedboys appear to benefit greatly from vocational offerings. According to aGossett staff member, the job readiness class in combination with vocationaltraining and certifications have helped many incarcerated boys find employmentin skilled sectors shortly after their release. It is not uncommon for "quite afew" children certified in automotive repair to be "hired by Midas" or to goimmediately into a "family business" upon their release.[421]Comparable opportunities do not exist for girls.V. Conditions of Confinement: Mental HealthMentalhealth problems are widespread among children in the juvenile justice system.[422]In New Yorkin 2004, of the children screened by OCFS for special needs when taken intocustody, 52 percent were identified as having mental health needs.[423]This official figure is not disaggregated by gender. Some research, and theexperience of practitioners, suggests that incarcerated girls generally havemore mental health needs than boys,[424]and are also more likely than boys to be diagnosed with more than one mentalhealth problem, often a mental health disorder together with a substance abusedisorder.[425]According to a knowledgeable source:The girls are different than the boys. A boys' facilitywill have about 85% delinquents and 15% mental health kids. At a girls'facility, it will be the reverse. The reason is that the girls get adjudicatedat a much higher rate for crimes like prostitution where they're actuallyvictims. So you're going to have a higher percentage of mental health kids inthe girls' system.[426]Moreover,research outside New Yorksuggests that a significant proportion of incarcerated adolescents suffer frompost traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and that girls are more likely than boysto develop PTSD when exposed to trauma.[427]Whether or not they suffer from PTSD, a high proportion of incarcerated girlshave experienced past trauma and abuse, which contribute to mental healthproblems.Seventy-sevenpercent of children admitted to OCFS custody in 2004 and screened by the agencywere found to have substance abuse problems.[428]Substance abuse needs to be addressed as part of an effective treatmentregimen, and as experts point out, must also be recognized in many cases as aneffort by children to self-medicate for untreated mental illness.[429]As a knowledgeable source put it:There aren't a whole lot of drug dealers in the girls'facilities. My opinion is that most girls who abuse drugs are self-medicating.That means you have to address the psychological underpinnings. The facilitieshave some substance abuse groups and they certainly could have more. But theyneed the mental health services, too. It shouldn't be an "either-or."[430]Asdescribed earlier in this section and in Girls'Delinquency: Systemic Failures and Pathways to Incarceration, above,children entering the juvenile justice system, and many girls in particular,have serious mental health needs. As one source put it:Twenty years ago OCFS wastaking turnstile jumpers and car thieves, now they're getting kids gettingkicked out of residential treatment centers because they're too violent andsuicidal. But OCFS is still treated as a detention program.[431]Lansingand Tryon face the difficult challenge of trying to help highly troubled girlsacquire the skills and self-knowledge they need to be able to cope, and ofaccomplishing this with limited budgetary resources and consequent limitationsin staff. Whether because of resource constraints, policy, or institutionalculture, HRW/ACLU are concerned that the facilities may fail to give sufficientpriority to the girls' needs for mental health interventions by professionalmental health staff, including individual therapy and medication, as well asfor a full range of psycho-social and therapeutic programs to provide girlswith improved life skills. We are also concerned that the culture in thefacilities may be too wedded to a punitive orientation. We were told by onesource, for example:Kids are looked at by this agency as either compliant ordefiant. They look at kids as being one-dimensional. Really, anybody is a rangeof things. Mental health people talk about dynamics, and know that if youunderstand the dynamics, you can address the behavior. OCFS sees that as makingexcuses for the kid, and says knock off the bad behavior or you're going to getpunishment.[432]AllOCFS facilities provide some form of mental health and substance abuse programming.At the Lansing and Tryon facilities, mental health services are provided by acombination of OCFS staff, staff of the state Office of Mental Health (OMH),and independent contractors. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding betweenOCFS and OMH, "mobile mental health teams" of OMH staff work daily in certainOCFS facilities, including Lansing and Tryon.[433]Mental health services include psychiatric services, as well as psychologicalcounseling provided by psychologists and social workers.Officialrecords for Lansing state that one psychiatristvisits the facility three days per month, and another visits Lansing's mental health unit at about thesame frequency.[434]Tryon appears to have a similar system, but official records provided to HRW/ACLUby OCFS contained less information regarding the frequency of psychiatrists'visit to the facility.[435]Psychiatrists' duties are described in agency documents as providing"treatment" to children needing psychiatric services.[436]Agency records state that psychiatrists are available to children for "consultby phone," and that Lansinghas "telepsychiatry equipment" connecting the psychiatrists from variousfacilities to each other.[437]According to an informed source, in practice, the psychiatrists' role is almostentirely limited to prescribing and administering psychotropic medication andperiodically monitoring the progress of medicated children.[438]OCFS describes psychologists' duties asdiagnosing and treating residents with signs of "mental illness, pooradjustment, and/or emotional/learning problems," as well as consulting withstaff, referring girls to the mental health unit, assisting in release planningand outpatient referrals, and administration.[439]According to an informed source, in practice, psychologists conduct diagnostictests, refer children to other facilities, and determine special educationalneeds, among other things.[440]Psychologists also provide therapy to children. Therapy involves working withchildren to understand what mental dynamics are occurring, patient education tohelp children understand their own condition, and symptom management, forexample, if a child expresses a wish to harm herself.[441]Social workers also provide therapy, but cannot conduct testing.[442]OCFSadministrators express pride in their achievements in providing mental healthcare to incarcerated girls. They point, for example, to the designated mentalhealth units at each of the Lansing and Tryon facilities as evidence of theirefforts.[443]Each of the two facilities has a unit to house children identified as havingthe most severe mental health needs, called the "mental health unit."[444]These mental health units are small, holding about 12 children rather than the20-25 held in the "generic," or non-mental health units.[445]An OMH "mobile mental health team" is assigned to each mental health unit andprovides intensive mental health treatment services on a daily basis.[446]According to OCFS documents, Lansing'smental health unit employs one psychologist, two psychiatric social workers,and a "treatment team leader."[447]Tryon's mental health unit is staffed by a psychologist and two social workers.[448]The establishment of the dedicated mental health units was unquestionably astep forward, especially since professional OMH psychiatrists, psychologistsand social workers are now placed in the units to give care to the childrenhoused there.[449] Nevertheless, the size of suchspecialized units is a concern. Grievance logs contain complaints by girls ofnot being allowed into such units despite believing that they requirespecialized care.[450]OCFSdocuments provided to HRW/ACLU provide much less detail about substance abusetreatment than they do about mental health treatment. They indicate that, at Lansing, group sessionsare held once per week by an outside contractor for girls "with the most severeabuse problems."[451]A staff schedule for Tryon indicates that a drug abuse counselor is availablefour full days per week.[452]Some interviewed girls told HRW/ACLU that they did not have substance abuseproblems and therefore did not receive treatment. Others described groupmeetings in which addiction and other issues were discussed. For example, BlessL., who was 14 when she was incarcerated in the Lansing facility, said:I was in S-unit, that's for substance abuse. Once a week,a lady named [ ] would come in to talk with us. On Friday, there was a littlegroup on the unit. They showed the "Beat the Streets" video, which is about howto get away from people who use. . . . It didn't help. I knew most of the stuffthe lady was telling me already and I didn't really care. If they want to helpus, they should get closer to residents, to understand where we're coming from.[453]Screeningand assessment are important first steps in the provision of mental healthcare. HRW/ACLU have been told by informed sources that girls entering TryonReceptionCenter are screened by amental health worker who administers psychometric "scales" for depression, IQ,and other values. These scores are combined with information about the girls' history,including for example, past mental illness and substance abuse, and the girl isassigned a score between one and four. A high score alerts the facility towhich the girl is ultimately assigned that she requires a more detailedassessment.[454]The usefulness of this preliminary assessment is undermined by the absence ofspecific facilities that could provide treatment tailored to girls' specificmental health problems and needs. A knowledgeable source describes this problemas follows:OCFS works like [adult] corrections, they classify thekids. The assessment is more relevant to the boys, because you have severalfacilities to choose from, for example, based on whether the boy is a regentsstudent or has mental retardation. With the girls, they're assigned to afacility by security and there aren't many facilities, so there's not a wholelot of choice. So it's sort of a perfunctory process that's done.[455]Oncegirls arrive at Lansing or Tryon, a more in-depth assessment may be performed.OCFS's facility operational guidelines for TryonGirlsCenter require thatchildren placed there "receive a brief mental health screening by medical staffat admission via the Admission Screening Interview."[456]If significant problems such as "bizarre thought" or "suicidal intent" areobserved during the screening, the facility administrator is to be notified"for further action."[457]If a girl receives a high "mental health screen score," a "mental healthassessment" is performed.[458]Whateverthe screening and testing indicate, the mental health services at Lansing andTryon remain limited because of a shortage of qualified staff.[459]The need for professional mental health services exceeds the beds in the mentalhealth units. The extent of the need is indicated by the fact that over thelast two years, an average of 53 percent of girls held at Lansing, and 64 percent of those held atTryon were administered psychiatric medication.[460]Yet at Lansing,the approximately seventy girls who are not in the mental health unit receive psychologicalservices from only one psychiatrist,onefull-time psychologist, and two part-time social workers.[461]At Tryon, one psychiatrist, three psychologists and a single psychiatric socialworker staff the non-mental health units.[462]OCFS administrators themselves acknowledge that more care is needed, citing budgetaryconstraints as the cause ofdeficiencies.[463]As explained to HRW/ACLU:To assign two or three mental health people for all ofthe kids that aren't on the mental health unit, that's a band-aid approach. . .. Those therapists can meet with the kids maybe once or twice a month. And thenthey have to do the discharge planning for every kid. So OCFS really needs toprovide more mental health staff.[464]Anotherinterviewee agreed, stating, "There aren't enough mental health providers, it'slimited for the number of children."[465]At least some girls have also complained about not having access to mentalhealth care when they feel they need it. In Lansing, over the course of one year, overtwenty grievances were filed by girls saying such things as "has not beencounseled, told someone would be available to talk to her,"[466]and "really needs to talk."[467]Other complaints state: "put in 2 sheets to contact social worker, noresponse,"[468]and "she feels she is about to blow/go crazy. Needs to talk to someone abouther issues."[469]One grievance reads: "not on meds, needs to talk to someone about issues goingon in her head."[470]According to Devon A., who is now 17 years old, access to mental healthprofessionals is limited:They're really picky about letting you get help from apsychologist. You have to go through [a supervisor], over staff, she'll set upan appointment with you. Usually it's okay, it's kind of helpful if you havethe right person.[471]Muchof the "counseling" children receive at Tryon and Lansing is not provided by mental healthprofessionals but by line staff who supervise the children day to dayas well as lead various group sessionsaddressing life skills, anger management, and victim awareness.[472] The counseling provided byline staff is a part of what OCFS calls its "behavior modification program," aneffort to help change children's behavior through positive and negativereinforcement taking the form of rewards and punishments.[473]Professionally trained mental health staff also lead group sessions as well asprovide individual therapy. We do not have data from OCFS regarding how many girlsreceive individual therapy, how long the sessions are, and the length of timegirls remain in therapy. Based on the limited information we have, however, weare concerned that the girls mental health needs are shortchanged because ofinadequate staffing.Somegirls find such programs helpful. For example, according to an OCFSadministrator, girls in OCFS facilities are offered a program called"Adelante."[474]Adelante was developed at Lansing by facilitiesstaff and addresses trauma from sexual abuse.[475]Devon A., who had been raped prior to her incarceration, did not describeparticipating in the Adelante program, but said she spoke with a "rapecoordinator" at Tryon about having been raped, and that the conversationshelped her to "become a survivor rather than a victim."[476]Yet, like the counseling performed by unit staff, these sessions do notconstitute professional mental health interventions or therapy but are intendedinstead to offer support to the girls and to help them learn to modify concretebehaviors such as the expression of anger.[477]An expert explained:They have groups where they teach certain topics likeanger control and social skills, and the YDC[478]does, runs the groups. She counsels them, and they tell these people a lot ofpersonal stuff, so these people who have no mental health training often findthemselves being mental health service providers.. . . You can see what the job description isfor a YDC, and it is not to provide mental health treatment. And some do seekout mental health providers when a child is having a particular difficulty, andthey recognize they're not able to provide the service.[479]Notsurprisingly, line staff vary in their commitment to and ability to provideeffective group sessions and individual support to the girls. Many directservice staff are inadequately prepared to help girls with their mental healthneeds. By incarcerating girls in facilities far from the girls' communities andfamilies, the state effectively supplants the girls' individual social networkswith facilities staff.[480]It is therefore unsurprising that the relationship between girls and the linestaff who supervise them daily in their living quarters is a major determinantof how girls view their experience of incarceration. This close interaction, incombination with the relatively infrequent contact girls have with anoverextended mental health staff, mean that the work of mental healthprofessionals can be significantly enhanced or undermined by line staff.The importance of a highly qualified staff inpromoting rehabilitation and providing positive role models is reflected indetailed international guidelines regarding staff selection, qualifications,remuneration, and training.[481]Juvenile justice services, moreover, are to be conducted, "with a view toimproving and sustaining the competence of personnel involved in the services,including their methods, approaches and attitudes."[482]Experts in juvenile development concur that to offer girls the possibility ofchanging self-destructive behavior, the facilities staff with whom girlsinteract day to day must be exceptionally skilled, nurturing, respectful, andnon-judgmental.[483]Yetnationwide, facilities staff often lack both the high level qualifications andthe nurturing attitude necessary to promote troubled children's development andmental health. New Yorkmay be no exception. Informed sources have stated to HRW/ACLU that direct carestaff in OCFS facilities frequently lack sufficient knowledge of mental healthissues to handle the complex demands posed by girls with mental health problems,and, depending on the facility, are insufficiently supervised.[484]As a service provider in a non-secure girls' OCFS facility put it:It's a punitive culture, not nurturing or therapeutic.Staff positions are not well paid, and you don't need any degree or muchadvanced education at all to hold them. The people who hold them, some staffare amazing, humane people. Most are grumpy, unhappy, overworked, underpaidadults who take it out on the girls. There's no motivation for empathy. Theyset the girls up, they pick favorites, they mock the girls, they set upcliques, they set up one girl against the others.[485]Thatstaff members, while generally well intentioned, are in many instancesunqualified and insufficiently trained to maintain the difficult balancebetween compassion and professionalism necessary to work with girls with mentalhealth problems is reflected in girls' reports of their interactions withstaff. While some girls said that certain staff members listened to them andprovided helpful advice about problems in the girls' lives, many girlscomplained of disrespectful or unfair treatment and of being singled out bycertain staff.OCFSgrievance records are replete with allegations of staff venting aggression ongirls, neglecting their job duties, targeting certain girls, and favoringothers.[486]According to girls' complaints, targeting takes the form of addressing themrudely, limiting girls' access to the bathroom, holding a grudge against girlsfor a past conflict, allowing girls to fight with each other, and even playingtricks on targeted girls.[487]Some girls felt that staff took their anger out on the girls. For example,girls at Tryon reported that playing kickball during physical education isn'tfun because the staff members play and hit the girls hard with the ball.[488]In their grievances, girls frequently describe staff as "rude," "nasty," andhaving an "attitude." Additionally, girls sometimes felt neglected by staff.Conversely,girls also complained that staff were sometimes too familiar with them, orshowed favoritism toward some girls. According to the girls' complaints, thisfavoritism takes the form of allowing some girls to physically touch staff incontravention of the rules, the giving of extra food, or allowing extra timefor phone calls or showers. Devon A. complained that facilities staff"personalized" with girls. When asked what she meant, she replied:Fall in love with the kids they're working with. Be softon certain people but not others. It's not falling in love but starting toreally care. I had a couple of staff that really cared about me and it got tothe point where they'd give you candy or bring food from home for you. Thatgives the kid authority. It can get really serious to the point where they geta memo or get suspended. If they get a memo or suspended they come into theunit really pissed off, they don't leave their attitude at the door. They say,"I'm not in the f-ing mood," and they say we're "too needy." If they thinkyou're too needy, they don't like you any more. It's permanent.[489]DevonA.'saccount is corroborated byfacilities grievance logs in which girls complain that staff members at theLansing and Tryon facilities tell girls that they are "attention seeking," "tooemotional, cries too much," a "cry baby," or "acting like a baby."[490]In fact, such attention seeking behavior may arise from a history ofvictimization.[491]Girlscomplain that their direct care staff mentors or counselors ignore them, putwords in their mouths, or avoid speaking to them for weeks at a time.[492]One girl at Tryon complained that she was told by her counselor that thecounselor "washes her hands of her."[493]A possible remedy to this is increased staff training on mental health issues.[494]Inaddition to depriving girls with mental health problems of the nurturance theyneed daily, insufficient knowledge among line staff of girls' mental healthconcerns can have additional consequences. As described in Violations of Privacy, above, poorly trained and supervised linestaff may inadvertently or purposefully disseminate intensely personalinformation concerning girls' health and histories.[495]Staff may also interfere with treatment, for example, by failing to dispensepsychotropic medications at the appropriate times,[496]or by disregarding recommendations made by mental health professionals.[497]Staffinsufficiently trained in mental health provision may also complicate theprovision of mental health services upon a girl's release. According tofacilities policies, psychological and regular staff are to "coordinate theirefforts with the after care worker in securing appropriate services in thecommunity" when children are released from the facility.[498]The development and execution of an aftercare plan for mental health care iscrucial because after a stay often lasting for a period of months,psychological treatment is usually incomplete and must be continued. YetHRW/ACLU was told that the coordination can be problematic, with the regularOCFS staff counselor making recommendations at odds with those of mental healthproviders, and with lax implementation by some OCFS aftercare workers.[499]In some cases, administrative confusion prevents Medicaid benefits from beingreactivated for girls leaving facilities, blocking girls from obtainingprescribed psychiatric medication.[500]Punishmentfor self-harm is also a concern. Confinement in a prison-like environment canaggravate mental health problems and increase the likelihood of self-mutilationand even suicide for some people.[501]When HRW/ACLU requested data from OCFS regarding the frequency of suicideattempts and self-harm among incarcerated girls, OCFS initially denied therequest, and later stated in response to an administrative appeal that it "doesnot maintain cumulative statistical data regarding . . . suicide or self-harm."[502]HRW/ACLU are perplexed by OCFS's failure to maintain such statistics.There is no question that girls in thesefacilities have engaged in suicide attempts and self-mutilation. [503]The monthly reports for Lansing and Tryon reveal numerous instances.[504] For example, a Tryonmonthly report stated:There was an incident whereby during a room check, astaff noticed that a youth had a pillowcase over her head. After removing thepillowcase it was subsequently discovered that this youth had a shoelace tiedaround her neck. The shoelace was cut off and the youth was placed on suicidewatch.[505]An earlierreport gives a similar account:There was an incident where a youth went into the schoolbathroom, tied a shoelace around her neck and to the doorknob. When the doorwas opened by staff, it was necessary to cut this shoelace off of her neck.This same youth swallowed a staple apparently one week later.[506]Asfor self-harm, when asked whether she had cut herself while at Tryon, FeliciaH. stated:Yeah, because it stressed me out. There's a lot of themthat do that. I used a staple, you can do it in your room and they don't knowwhat you're doing.[507]WhenAlicia K. was asked whether she had ever witnessed it at Tryon she replied:You see that a lot. They'd use an eraser to put theirname on their arm. You go over it with an eraser until it burns. Then you leaveit over night. Then you peel the scab so it scars. Other people use paper clipsor staples. They'd write their name or their tag[508]or whatever.[509]Childrencan harm themselves for psychiatric reasons or to gain attention or both.[510]Within as without institutional settings, self-cutting is moreprevalent among adolescent girls than other groups, and is usually diagnosed asa symptom of an anxiety disorder or borderline character disorder, and in somecases may be traced to psychiatric medications such as Prozac or certain otherantidepressants.[511]As explained by Terry Kupers, M.D., M.S.P.:Some say they do it to see the blood and know they arealive, some to feel the pain, but in most there's a resolution of a certainamount of anxiety after they cut or self-harm. They are suffering emotionalpain, and definitely need psychiatric attention.[512]Staffmust respond when they see a child trying to injure themselves, but the natureof the response should be calibrated to the situation.If a kid's got a staple, sometimes it's "look what I got,look what I'm doing," but staff get involved in a power struggle in trying toget the staple away. A kid can't kill herself with a staple or a broken button,but kids have gotten restrained for having them.[513]Girlsin OCFS custody who attempt suicide or are otherwise believed to be a suiciderisk are put on suicide watch, where they are constantly watched by staff andmonitored by a psychologist.[514]Girls may also receive more counseling than usual.[515]Girlswho have engaged in lesser forms of self-harm, such as scarring themselves, maybe put on "personal safety watch," in which staff must check up on the girlevery 15 minutes. But in at least some cases, self-harm receives punishment aswell as treatment. For example, a grievance report from Tryon, reads:[Name redacted] is grieving because she received a Level3 for self-mutilation - there were no witnesses to this and also residentstates she carved herself 2 weeks ago. States counselor said if staff did notwitness this, then she shouldn't have received a Level III.[516]Thatgirls are punished for mutilating themselves is also confirmed by Alicia K'sexperience:If you got caught in the act, you got restrained. If theycaught you later it was self-mutilation, a level three. It's written up like areferral in school, an automatic extra thirty days and disciplinary action. Noextra counseling though. Everyone had to see the counselor once a month.[517]Internationalstandards prescribe complete mental health assessments of incarcerated childrenas soon as possible after they are admitted to a facility, and provide detailsas to the kinds of reports and individualized treatment plans that should begenerated for each child.[518]Children found to be suffering from mental illness should "be treated in aspecialized institution under independent medical management."[519]New York caselaw recognizes a right under the United States Constitution to adequaterehabilitative treatment for all incarcerated children.[520]In addition, under international norms, juvenile facilities should offertreatment for drug abuse administered by qualified personnel and tailored tothe age, sex, and other characteristics of the children served.[521]Delinquency court judges, moreover, place girls in facilities with theexpectation that they will receive particular mental health care services, andoften enter an explicit order to that effect.[522]By incarcerating mentally ill children in prison-likefacilities such as Lansing and Tryon, New York State is failing to meet theinternational standard requiring mentally ill children to be treated inspecialized medical institutions. In addition, in those instances in which New York fails to provide adequate mental health care forchildren with mental health problems, the state is violating its duty under U.S. constitutionallaw to provide adequate rehabilitative services to all children.General Health ConcernsUnder international guidelines, every incarceratedchild is entitled to receive adequate medical care.[523] The provision of care isespecially important for a population of children who often lack adequatehealth care prior to their incarceration, a situation provoking complaints frompublic health experts that because aspects of the larger health care andwelfare systems do not function effectively, the juvenile justice system hasbecome a major provider of health care to indigent children.[524]Although not all children admitted to OCFS custody arescreened for health, mental health, substance abuse, and other needs,[525] girls do receive a healthscreening when they enter TryonReceptionCenter.[526] The girls that HRW/ACLUspoke to did not know or did not remember specifically what they had beentested for besides sexually transmitted infections, and did not appear to havereceived detailed information or counseling regarding the outcome of thescreening.[527]Mostgirls expressed satisfaction with the health care they received for routineproblems such as colds and menstrual pain. That girls' physical health needsare met is corroborated by other sources whom HRW/ACLU interviewed.[528] Girls who need medical carewhile held in the facilities are required to fill out a form, called a "sickcall," requesting a visit to medical staff.[529] An on-site nurse mustevaluate the girl's needs, treat her if possible, and refer her to an outsideprovider if necessary. According to residents of Tryon, there is no physician,eye doctor, or dentist on-site, but they do visit the facility regularly.[530]Somegirls reported problems with various aspects of the provision of health care atthe facilities. In their grievances, girls complain that their requests formedical care are ignored, even after they submit multiple sick call formsregarding the same medical complaint. Other girls complain that they had towait for days, weeks, or even months before they receive care.[531] Yet others complain thatthe on-site nurse is only available until 6p.m., rather than 24 hours a day, or that on-site staff isreluctant to refer girls' problems for specialist care, even when the problemcannot be treated effectively at the facility.[532]VI. Conditions of Confinement: Isolation andRelated IssuesIsolated ConfinementInternational norms prohibit subjecting children to "closedor solitary confinement or any other punishment that may compromise thephysical or mental health of the juvenile concerned."[533]New Yorkstate regulations permit isolated confinement, known as "room confinement" or"lock-up," only when a child "constitutes serious and evident danger to himselfor others."[534]The facilities' monthly reports record only the relativelyfew instances in which room confinement is imposed because a girl poses adanger to herself or others.[535]In these officialrecords, Tryon reported no use of isolated confinement for the period betweenJanuary 2004 and January 2006.[536]For the same period, Lansingreported an average of 2 instances per month of room confinement for periods ofless than an hour. Isolation for more than an hour occurred an average of 6times per month, ranging between 0 and 19 times per month.[537]Yet girls in both facilities described incidents ofbeing confined to their rooms for long periods of time for seeminglyarbitrarily reasons or because staff found it more convenient.[538]Girls complained mostof isolation in TryonReceptionCenter,where all girls to be confined in an OCFS secure or non-secure facility areinitially sent for two weeks for evaluation.[539]Although OCFS literature states that girls "receive thorough assessmentse.g.medical, educational, psychological and mental health" in addition to formalorientation during the two week period,[540]girls held at Tryon Reception Center complained that little time was spentassessing their needs or providing them with services; rather, the bulk of theirtime was spent sitting alone in their cells. They reported that during the daythey were not allowed to lie down on their bunks.Suchisolation also occurs in the regular housing units of Tryon and Lansing. Interviewsand grievance logs suggest that girls view doing chores as a privilege, becauseit represents an opportunity to leave their rooms.[541]Girls complain that staff sometimes deny them the opportunity to do theirchores, or start girls on their chores late, resulting in more time spent bythe girls in their rooms.Somegirls confined at Tryon complained of confinement in Tryon's "mudroom." FeliciaH., 17 at the time ofher incarceration, described the "mudroom," which exists in each unit atTryon:You come in the unit, and to the right there's a big areawith rooms off it, and to the left that's where we live, and in the middlethere's a hallway with a booth in the middle, toward the outside. That's themudroom. The mudroom is a regular hallway, it's small, when you get in trouble,they say, "Go to the mudroom, stand with your hands behind your back." You haveto stand still and look straight forward.[542]Asked how long she was made to stand in the mudroom,Felicia H. replied:Three hours or so. I was mad about everything, I wasalways mad. Sometimes staff is in there with you, sometimes not. If they'reconfronting you, there's staff. Or they'll just come in and out to check onyou.[543]AliciaK. described her experience in the mudroom:It's a little hall between the two sides of the unit.There is nothing in there. You stand, you can't sit. Sometimes a staff memberis there, sometimes not. You're there an hour or longer sometimes. The mudroomusually leads to a restraint. You have to "assume a position." That's stand upwith your hands behind your back in the shape of a diamond. If you move, it'san automatic restraint. They kind of egg you on, they yell at you. "If you moveone inch, I'm going to drop you."[544]Anothergirl held at Tryon complained that a staff person had spit in her face and toldher to "shut up" when she was being held in the mudroom.[545]Such examples suggest that girls aremade to stand alone in the mudroom as a form of punishment, although the staffmembers involved may view these incidents differently. As described elsewherein this report, however, HRW/ACLU were not permitted access to the facilitiesnor to members of the line staff, and therefore could not obtain the staff'sperspectives or other information to test the validity of these accounts.Asubtler form of isolation takes the form of restrictions on conversation amonggirls. Some girls complained that although not locked in their rooms, they werekept away from their peers.[546]Denise J. said that if a girl was caught talking to other girls at TryonReceptionCenter, she was punished.[547]Selena B., who had been held at Lansing,said that Christmas was fun in the facility because "we got to associate witheach other."[548]Socialisolation can be expected to be especially damaging to girls because researchreveals that connection with others is essential to their development.[549]In addition, when persons with any propensity to self-harm areplaced in isolated confinement, they demonstrate a very high incidence ofanxiety and are much more likely to harm themselves.[550]The following commentsof the girls themselves, drawn from facilities grievance logs in which staffmembers summarize girls' complaints, suggest that isolation and prolonged lackof stimulation negatively impact girls' mental health. One grievance cites "havingto stay in their rooms all the time. It affects her because she thinks aboutcutting herself."[551]Another complains that, "she is staying in her room for long periods of timeand she begins to think about what her stepfather did to her."[552]Current understanding of the importance of a "relationship based" model ofjuvenile programming is contradicted by the practices of the Lansing and Tryonfacilities.IdlenessIn addition, international standards require thatincarcerated juveniles be provided with beneficial activities,[553]yet girls describe being subjected to lengthy periods of idleness at thefacilities. Grievance log entries show complaints that girls are, for example,"sitting there and doing nothing,"[554]"sitting around doing nothing-wants something to do,"[555]and "tired of being bored."[556]Theproblem of idleness in the Lansingfacility appear to be most severe in the disciplinary "C-Unit," which wascreated to contain the most problematic girls. The threat of confinement in the"C-Unit" is also used to curb misbehavior by girls in other units. The girlsheld in the "C-Unit" have very little to do, must attend school in the unit, andare never allowed to attend assemblies or other facilities events.[557]It's very boring. The kids don't have structured thingsto do for a great deal of their day. That's why the kids go crazy, get intofights. There's isn't enough to do. There aren't enough art supplies. Theyspend an inordinate amount of time indoors.[558]Limitations on Contact with the OutsideWorldA number offactors converge to cut off girls incarcerated in New YorkStatefrom the outside world. The remote location of the Lansing and Tryon facilitiesis a major factor effectively weakening or severing ties between girls andtheir families and communities. The sheer distance between the facilities andgirls' homes is exacerbated by restrictions on contact and further yet by staffinterference with girls' communications. Moreover, the attorneys who representchildren during delinquency proceedings essentially cease to do so when childrenare sent to OCFS facilities, and are not even routinely informed as to whichfacility their client enters. The combination of these factors, along with thefailure of grievance mechanisms and the absence of oversight, hide conditionswithin the facilities from the public eye.Lack of Attorney Access upon IncarcerationUnder international law,children are entitled to legal representation during delinquencyproceedings as well as in post-adjudication proceedings,at the very least to appeal the incarceration decision itself.[559] Likewise, under U.S.law, children are entitled to legalrepresentation during delinquency proceedings,[560]and professional standards require post-dispositionrepresentation to file appeals, conduct regular reviews of how the youth isfaring, ensure receipt of services, and assess the continued appropriateness ofplacement, as well as address conditions of confinement.[561]Children in New York receive littlepost-disposition representation. In NewYorkState,about half of the children charged with offenses are represented by the LegalAid Society or other institutional legal services providers and the other halfare represented by state-funded, or "18-B" attorneys.[562] InNew York City, between65 and 70 percent of children charged with juvenile delinquency are representedby Legal Aid.[563]Factors such as the courts' and attorneys' overburdened caseloads and lack ofresources contribute to a dilution of the quality of representation and delaysin proceedings, and can make post-adjudication follow-up with youth impossible.[564]Counsel is available for appeals of individual cases,but defense counsel are not funded to do follow-up representation concerningconditions of confinement once children are remanded to OCFS custody. Notsurprisingly, the girls interviewed by HRW/ACLU reported not knowing who their lawyerwas, having only seen their lawyer briefly in court, not being contacted bytheir lawyer after their case was adjudicated, and not attempting to contacttheir lawyer after being taken to the facility. Selena B., who was 12 years oldwhen she was placed in OCFS custody, said, "I was supposed to appeal, I had ayellow slip to appeal, but I lost it in court."[565]Even those children who maintain contact with theirattorneys once incarcerated are sometimes blocked from contacting theirattorneys or from communicating with them in private. One Lansing resident filed a grievance statingthat she received no help calling her lawyer.[566]Improved attorney contact would provide a means for incarcerated girls tocommunicate their concerns to the outside world, and the absence of this outletmakes it less likely that problematic facilities conditions will be addressed.Family VisitsThegeographical isolation of New York'sgirls' facilities poses an enormous barrier to girls' exercise of their rightto family contact. Although the majority of children held at the Lansing andTryon facilities come from New York City, bothfacilities are located in upstate NewYork. The Tryon facility is about 190 miles away fromNew York City.The Lansingfacility is about 230 miles away. These long distances severely limitincarcerated girls' access to their families.Often,family members do not have access to a car, or must rely on other relatives fortransportation, or may have difficulty finding their way to the facilities evenif they are able to find secure transport. The facilities offer no bus or othertransportation services to families. In New YorkState,the percentage of children living in families without a car, 22 percent, ismuch higher than the national average of 6 percent.[567]In New York City,where many of the families of incarcerated children reside, over half ofhouseholds have no car available to them.[568]Thus, despite the availability of weekend visiting hours, the location of the facilitiesand the failure of authorities to help families bridge the transportation gapdenies children family visits. Janine Y. described her experience at TryonReception and at an upstate non-secure facility:They lock us up so far from home. How are our parentssupposed to come see us? They're not so fortunate to be able to go all the wayupstate. My family never came. It was too far. And my aunt had a little baby.[569]Restrictionson visitation may also interrupt girls' access to family. Family members mayonly visit on Saturdays and Sundays from 1:00pmto 4:00pm, a major barrierfor family members who must work on weekends.[570]According to agency regulations, children have the right to receive "any andall visitors" during visiting hours, although facilities "may" act to excludevisitors unaccompanied by the child's parents, guardian, or "other suitableperson."[571]The facilities themselves interpret these guidelines narrowly: According tofacilities staff at Tryon, only relatives over the age of twenty-one who are ona list of approved visitors are allowed to visit the residents and, inpractice, it sometimes takes months for residents to add visitors to the list.[572]Tryon's grievance logs contain complaints by girls that an aunt and uncle, andthe father of a girl's child, were excluded from making personal visits.[573]One girl confined at Tryon complained that she was not allowed to see all ofher family and "[w]ants to know who can really determine who 'immediate family'is. Wants to be able to see ALL of her family."[574]Thedistance between the facilities and New York City not only affects families'ability to visit their children, but also impedes many outside serviceproviders who would otherwise be available to work with girls incarcerated atLansing and Tryon. According to a NewYork City service provider assisting girls exposed tocommercial sexual exploitation, her group rarely makes contact with girls fromLansing or Tryon because the sheer distance to the facilities makes conductingoutreach there impracticable. [575]Girls,moreover, experience geographical isolation from their families at an early anddeterminative phase of their incarceration. During the two week evaluationperiod prior to their final placement, girls are held at TryonReceptionCenter, which isphysically as well as administratively part of the Tryon complex. Boys, on theother hand, spend their two week evaluation period at the PyramidReceptionCenter,located in the Bronx, in New York City.Thus boys' families can more easily visit their child during a frightening andisolating period of initial incarceration. Although OCFS literature describes"[f]amily involvement" as a "key element" in the evaluation process,[576]such involvement may, as a practical matter, be impossible for the families ofgirls.TheU.S.'sinternational human rights obligations recognize the right to respect for thefamily, a duty which continues despite a child's incarceration.[577] International standards alsorecognize that each child "the right to maintain contact with his or her familythrough correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances . . . ."[578]Specifically, incarcerated children have the right to "receive regular andfrequent visits, in principle once a week" from family members.[579]In addition, experts in girls' development recognize the importance ofpromoting and sustaining family and other relationships to girls' psychologicalhealth.[580]Telephone Calls and MailUnderinternational standards, children deprived of their liberty have the right tocommunicate in writing or by telephone regularly with persons of their choice,and have the right to receive correspondence.[581]Girls held at Lansingand Tryon are allowed some access to the telephone. They are allowed to receivea certain number of calls per week, and may make one or two collect calls perweek from a pay phone. Sometimes, girls are allowed to make a free call from a staffoffice. Calls are limited to ten minutes each, and must be made within a windowof time during the day. The grievance logs of both Lansing and Tryon containmany complaints about staff interference with telephone calls in the form ofdenying calls,[582]cutting calls short,[583]and failures by staff to help girls receive calls.[584]One girl reported not being able to contact her family during the two weeks shewas held at Tryon Reception.[585]In addition, girls reported that theline is often busy when their families call,[586]and that incoming calls are otherwise interfered with.[587]Girlsincarcerated at Tryon and Lansingare allowed to send and receive letters. To send letters, they buy stamps with moneysent to them by relatives or from an account maintained by the state into which$1.25 is deposited per week for postage and commissary.[588]As with telephone calls, girls have lodged many complaints about interferencewith their ability to communicate with the outside world by mail. Typically,girls complain that staff fail to take out outgoing mail,[589]or do so only infrequently,[590]withhold incoming mail,[591]deny girls paper on which to write,[592]and read outgoing or incoming mail.[593]A girl held in room confinement was not allowed to write a letter to hermother.[594]Ebony V. said:They don't want you to keep your relationship with yourparents. They limit your calls and your mail. Your mail gets confiscated. Myaunty wrote me a letter and it got confiscated, because she wrote 'aunty' onthe envelope and not her real name.[595]Sample letter from a girl incarceratedin the LansingfacilityIdentifying information hasbeen redacted to protect the author's privacy.-Click to expand ImageLibrary and Media AccessThereis a small computer lab in the library at Tryon which does not allow access tothe internet. Girls held at Tryon are allowed to check one book out of thelibrary at a time but report that the books in the library are old and do notinterest them.[596]A few incarcerated girls complain that they are not given enough access tobooks,[597]or are discouraged from reading.[598]Asked whether TryonReceptionCenterhas a library, Janine Y. replied, "No, just a book shelf with a couple of bookson it."[599]International standards call for every juvenile facility to provide"access to a library that is adequately stocked with both instructional andrecreational books and periodicals suitable for the juveniles, who should beencouraged and enabled to make full use of it."[600]In addition, incarcerated children have the right to access publications andbroadcasts to keep themselves informed of goings on in the outside world.[601]VII.Reentry and the Effects of IncarcerationUnder international norms,children who find themselves in conflict with the law have the right to betreated in a way which promotes their social reintegration and their ability totake on a constructive role in society.[602]Upon releasing a child, facilities are responsible for making "arrangementsdesigned to assist them in returning to society, family life, education oremployment."[603]Facilities staff must coordinate with community service providers with a viewto ensuring children a smooth return to the community upon release.[604]In particular, provisions should be made for mental health care to be continuedbeyond release.[605]Reentry assistance is lacking for many girls released fromOCFS custody and nonexistent for some. Felicia H. was taken from her mother'scustody at the age of 8, and involved first in the child welfare system andthen the juvenile justice system until being released in 2006 from Tryon on theday she turned 18.[606]Some post-release planning was attempted, but seemed to fall apart when FeliciaH.'s mother and stepfather, with whom she has always had a troubledrelationship, proved unprepared to accept her into their home. This rejectionwas entirely foreseeable.They had a whole plan for me set up, but my homeassessment kept coming back negative so they couldn't send me home. A monthbefore going home I said I wanted to go to a group home and stay until I wastwenty-one, until I was stable. [My lawyer] was trying, too. But they [thefacilities staff] said it was too late.[607]Felicia H. was not placed in any educational or job trainingprograms, or even provided with written information concerning such programs.She was simply placed in a New YorkCity homeless shelter:They released me to Covenant House. It's not good inthere. I saw a lot of junkies, it's cold and not homey, it's scary, girls arealways fighting. I've been sleeping at friends' houses.[608]Thus, after ten years enmeshed in the child welfare and laterthe juvenile justice system, Felicia H. found herself ejected from OCFS with aninth grade education, no school or work plans, and no home. Devon A. had asimilar experience. When asked what reentry assistance she had received whenpreparing to leave Tryon, she responded:They didn't do anything.Sometimes, talkingabout this stuff makes me angry, that I allowed this to happen to me.Iget some help through the foster care agency, Saint Christopher.All theydo at Tryon is get you ready to leave, make sure your home is ready to acceptyou on such and such a date, then you're out the door.[609]Post-release services are even more scant for children placedin contract residential facilities, rather than in state-run facilities.Children in privately-run contract facilities are required to spend theirentire placement in the facilities, and the contract agencies are provided nostate funding for post-release services.[610]Some contract agencies raise private funds to provide follow-up services whileat least one simply releases children "with a bus ticket."[611]While some children are unconditionally released afterserving their entire placements, others are conditionally released to"aftercare," the juvenile equivalent of parole. These children often areprovided with more services, but to avoid rearrest must comply with rules such ascurfew, abstaining from drinking or doing drugs, regular school or workattendance, obeying parents and not running away, regular reporting to a caseworker, and abstaining from contact with anyone who might exert a bad influence.[612]Aftercare workers are charged with supervising and serving children during theconditional release period, including enrolling children in school, helpingthem resolve personal problems, and referring children to community basedservices.[613]Children may receive one of three levels of supervision or they may be enrolledin one of a number of more intensive programs.[614]When asked what care she would receive after leaving BrooklynResidentialCenter, a non-secure OCFSfacility, Amy F., now 14 years old, replied:I'll be in aftercare for a couple of months. They'regoing to see how I do, good or bad. The aftercare worker helps you with thingsif you want help.[615]Asked what assistance she received upon leaving OCFS, JanineY. replied:They just sent me to my aunt's house. And I went to aprogram called City Challenge. It's helpful, it is.[616]A number of serious deficiencies have been identified in theaftercare services provided by OCFS. According to a children's advocacy group, aftercarecounselors do not receive some children's case files or begin facilitatingtheir transition until shortly prior to the children's release or even on theday of release. In addition, counselors' caseloads are too high, assessments ofthe ability of children's families to accept them are inadequate, post-releaseservices to the family are lacking, children are not regularly reenrolled inMedicaid, leaving them uninsured, and it may take weeks or months to reenrollchildren in school. The group also asserts that children's school attendance isinsufficiently monitored and their attendance at aftercare appointments notstrictly required, and that counselors are left to compile their own, sometimesincomplete, lists of community resources to which to refer their clients.[617]Echoing some of these concerns, a service provider interviewed by HRW/ACLU wascritical of the aftercare provided by OCFS:Another problem is "aftercare." There's no such thing. .. . "Aftercare" is supposed to be the link, [the girls] are supposed to go toan office that gets them connected to public assistance, a job, an education.But it's a joke because just one aftercare worker handles a few boroughs. Sothe girl gets five minutes, then she gets a listing of jobs from two weeks ago.The limited and little support the girls get once they're out is horrendous.The state wants to wash its hands of the situation. . . . I've been insituations where staff in charge of aftercare will force a girl to reconcilewith her parents or sign herself out at eighteen because it looks good if rollsare reduced. Every girl has an "expiration date" and it looks good to get themout by then. The girls don't want to be there, they're missing out on theiradolescence, they have a lot of fantasies about what it'll be like, but whenthey get out it's hard for them to survive.[618]Facilities staff say that they find it hard to help girlstransition back to the communities because they are not in touch with servicesin the communities.[619]OCFS has recently established a Bureau ofAftercare Services charged with providing post-release reintegration assistanceto children, which it hopes will help close the services gap.[620]Maintaining the continuity of mental health care provision isespecially problematic for girls leaving OCFS facilities. OCFS attempts toprovide transitional services directly and through partnerships with otheragencies and by contracting with outside providers. At its most effective,aftercare involves a team of professionals who get to know a child and herfamily prior to her release and provide psychological counseling inanticipation of the turbulent process of reintegration.[621]The provision of such services to girls is hampered by the paucity of programsspecific to girls.[622]In addition, while programs frequently apply facially gender-neutral criteria whendetermining eligibility-such as the severity of crime the potential participantcommitted, the severity of the child's mental health problems, and thestability of their families-girls are disproportionately affected because girlson average commit higher level offenses before they are committed, exhibit moremental health needs, and come from more volatile families.[623]Appearing to recognize this problem, OCFS has in some cases urged serviceproviders to follow special intake rules for girls.[624]VIII. Lackof Accountability, Oversight, and Transparency in OCFSI just want to tell people before someone gets reallyhurt.[625]As already noted, the Tryon and Lansingfacilities are closed to outside scrutiny by virtue of walls and fences andrestrictions on residents' contact with the outside world, and by virtue oftheir isolation in rural areas hundreds of miles from children's families andattorneys. They are also closed institutions unresponsive to the complaints oftheir wards and shielded from public scrutiny by failures of oversight and barriersto outside monitoring.International standards relating to incarcerationrecognize that abuses occur and persist in such closed environments, and thatthe protection of the rights of incarcerated children in particular depends onmeaningful oversight.[626]Given the potential forabuse of children when they are placed in isolated, confined settings, the incidenceof abuse known to occur at OCFS facilities, and the agency's refusal to curbabuse internally, independent monitoring is urgently needed. Yet in New York, means of potential scrutiny are systematicallyinadequate or underutilized, and efforts at fact gathering stymied.Grievance Procedures and Staff AccountabilityToo often we found that the grievance system . . . wasnot working, in some cases actually sabotaged.[627]At OCFS facilities, agrievance procedure is in place in which girls make written complaints on aform that they place in a grievance box located in their unit. Their grievanceis initially reviewed by unit staff members, and in theory, if it cannot beresolved in this first "step," the girl can proceed up the administrative chainby filing "step 2" and "step 3" grievances. Interviewed girls unanimously describedthe grievance procedure as frustrating and ineffective. Their major complaintwas that grievances are simply ignored.[628]At times, submitted forms are simply not responded to at all. At other times,girls receive confirmation that their grievance has been received, but nosubsequent communication. Girls who attempt to follow up on their grievancesare told by staff that a response is forthcoming, but often do not receive anyfollow up communication.Girls sometimes attempt to have their grievances heardthrough alternative channels, by speaking directly with staff, or writingdirectly to the facility director.[629] Some girls reported havingattempted to address complaints to the OCFS ombudsman but having received noresponse.[630] (The intended role of theombudsman is described below.) Other girls were not put in contact with theombudsman, or were told explicitly that they could not speak to the ombudsman.[631]Girls reported that the unresponsiveness of the process drovethem to give up on filing grievances after a few attempts, and to give up pursuingfiled grievances at the first "step." Other factors may also result inunderutilization of grievances. A few girls reported being blocked from filinggrievances, or feeling retaliated against by the staff about whom they filedcomplaints.[632] Fifteen-year-old Lana S.,held at Tryon, told HRW/ACLU that she was never told about the grievanceprocess and did not know how to file a grievance.[633]Other girls reported that, because thegrievances are handled at the initial step by the very staff against whom grievancesare filed, responding staff typically protect their colleagues and make thecomplainant feel at fault. Devon A.'s assessment of the grievance process isrepresentative:They'd try to solve the problem to their best interest. Igrieved because I was being screamed at and called out of my name.[634]I grieved. They denied it. I don't know what happened. No one knows whathappens to their grievances.[635]The ineffectiveness of the grievance process is particularlydangerous in light of the physical and sexual abuse that occurs at thefacilities. One grievance, for example, reads: "Wants someone to listen to them(residents) when they complain about a male doing 'stuff' to them."[636] Nevertheless, OCFS does notappear to track its responsiveness to grievances filed by children.[637]The ineffectiveness of the grievance process also may be underminingeffective internal response to abuses against incarcerated girls. Agencyrecords disclosed to HRW/ACLU do indicate that many incidents of physical orsexual abuse are responded to with calls to the state's Child Abuse Hotline,and some facility records note that an allegation is being investigated, eitherinternally or by a county sheriff's department. The outcome of these investigationsis unclear, but disclosed records suggest that little criminal or disciplinary actionagainst is taken against implicated staff. In one month in Tryon, for example,allegations of sexual contact were made against two separate staff members.[638] Both allegations werereported to the Child Abuse Hotline but "neither of these reports wereaccepted."[639] No action appears to havebeen taken against one staff member, and the other was simply transferred temporarilyfrom one unit to another within the Tryon facility.[640] Further reference to theseallegations in subsequent reports is missing.HRW/ACLU requested information from OCFS regarding facilitiesadministrators' response to specific allegations of abuse, particularly theirinvestigations of such claims and any disciplinary or corrective action taken.[641]The request for information was denied except as to letters containing chargesagainst staff and subsequent letters settling the charges. Of only 9 suchcharges issued by the Lansing and Tryon facilities combined for the period fromNovember 2002 to November 2005, only 4 concerned the improper physicalrestraint of girls, and the dispositions were lenient.[642]Although OCFS's limited response to our request might not tell the whole story,the evidence it provided suggests that its enforcement of children's rightsagainst its own facilities administrators and staff is weak.International law providesdetailed guidance about appropriate complaints procedures for incarceratedchildren.[643]Children must be given the right to complain directly to the facility directoror her representative,[644]and to a central administrative or judicial authority and to receive a promptresponse.[645]Children also have a right of access to an independent office established toreceive complaints,[646]and to assistance in accessing all of these channels.[647]In particular, where a child has a complaint about an incident such as physicaland sexual abuse, the UnitedStates has a binding treaty obligation toensure a prompt and impartial investigation into such allegations.[648]Absence of Internal OversightNo one's ever seen the ombudsman. We don't knowwhether he exists or not.[649]New York law provides for some internalfacilities oversight. By state regulation, there must exist within OCFS anOffice of the Ombudsman staffed by attorneys.[650]The ombudsmen are entitled to visit facilities, hear children's grievances,investigate alleged violations, and otherwise represent the rights ofincarcerated children vis--vis OCFS.[651]According to the regulations, the ombudsman is to report to, among others, anIndependent Review Board (IRB) comprised of between nine and fifteen peopleoutside of OCFS, at least one of whom is to be a former resident or the parentof a resident, and another of whom is to be a psychologist or other clinician.[652]In addition, the superintendent of each facility is to be advised by a board ofvisitors composed of a cross-section of lay people in the community.[653]Both the IRB and the boards of visitors are entitled to access the facilitiesand speak to residents and staff.[654]The OCFS Ombudsman'sOffice was created in 1973 as a federally funded project of the Legal AidSociety and what was then called the Division for Youth.[655]In its original form, the Ombudsman's Office had five attorneys who regularlymade unannounced visits to juvenile facilities, spoke freely with residents inprivate, represented children in administrative proceedings, investigatedalleged abuses, and had direct access to senior agency administrators.[656]According to Vincent O'Brien, an attorney who served as an OCFS ombudsman forthirty years, the key to the office's effectiveness was the aggressiveinvolvement of the Independent Review Board whose members both visited thefacilities whenever possible and mediated between the Ombudsman's Office andthe agency administration.[657]In 1991, theombudsman program was eliminated as part of a statewide administrativereduction, and shortly thereafter one attorney was rehired and placed within OCFS'sOffice of General Counsel.[658]Although the state regulations concerning the ombudsman's power were not withdrawn,the general counsel imposed restrictions on the ombudsman, prohibitingunannounced visits, reducing and at times prohibiting access to the agency'sadministration, and drastically curtailing the operation of the IRB.[659]There is no evidence that the boards of visitors contemplated in theregulations were ever established for any facility.[660]Since 1991, theOmbudsman's Office, consisting of at most one attorney and one non-attorney, hasbeen so understaffed that it cannot exercise meaningful oversight. At best, theombudsman has been able to visit each of the over thirty OCFS facilities onceevery two years and therefore can only rarely meet with confined children inperson, and cannot seriously investigate complaints. The ombudsman no longerrepresents children in hearings. Even to the extent that the Ombudsman's Officeis able to function, its location within OCFS and specifically within theGeneral Counsel's Office makes independence impossible.[661]The Independent Review Boardis also moribund, consisting only of four persons, none of whom is a formerresident or a psychologist, and has not held a meeting or visited a facilityfor several years.[662]According to former ombudsman Vincent O'Brian,"What I witnessed was the gradual and deliberate erosion of the independentnature of the operation. I often felt that the remnants of the office weremaintained primarily for 'window dressing.'"[663]In short, OCFS has all but eliminated the Ombudsman's Office and IRB asoriginally conceived, in violation of its own regulations. In August 2005, thesingle ombudsman resigned, and no replacement was hired for almost sevenmonths, until March 2006.[664]Without any meaningful form of internal oversight, children confined in OCFSfacilities have often had no one to advocate on their behalf.This state of affairs stands in contrast to the requirements of internationalstandards which specifically prescribe "regular inspections and other means of control carriedout . . . by a duly constituted body authorized to visit the juveniles and notbelonging to the detention facility,"[665]and who specifically ensure facilities' comply with international standards.[666]To comply with international guidelines, such monitoring should be frequent,regular, unannounced, and unrestricted,[667]and every child in the facility "should have the right to talk in confidence toany inspecting officer."[668]In addition, qualified medical officers must monitor the "physical environment,hygiene, accommodation, food, exercise and medical services, as well as anyother aspect or conditions of institutional life that affect the physical andmental health of juveniles."[669]Investigations should be accompanied by thorough public reporting.[670]Inadequacy of External Governmental MonitoringOther state agencies have had some involvement in juvenile conditionsconcerns but their effectiveness is uncertain. Since its creation in the 1980s,the state's Child Protective Services (CPS) office has investigated someallegations of abuse within state juvenile facilities,[671]but girls interviewed by HRW/ACLU were not aware of the existence of CPS andconsequently had never attempted to contact CPS.[672]Indeed, it appears that the mediation of the Ombudsman's Office (mostlyineffectual, as described above) is required for girls' complaints to reach CPS,[673]and at any rate the Child Abuse Hotline is operated by New York's Child Protective Servicesoffices, a division of OCFS. Likewise, the State Inspector General's Office isempowered to inquire into allegations of mistreatment at juvenile facilities.In response to reports by facilities staff of physical abuse of boys, theInspector General recently investigated the Louis Gossett Residential Facility,located across the street from the Lansingfacility.[674]The Inspector General'sOffice cannot, however, be relied upon to exercise meaningful ongoing oversightof OCFS facilities because its mandate is broad, encompassing fraud and abuseby both individuals and agencies as to over 200 state entities as well asprivate persons and business operating in New York.[675] The office conducts no regularmonitoring visits to OCFS facilities. In the absence of such visits, allegationsof abuse rarely come to light except in extraordinary cases in which staff actas whistleblowers.[676]Moreover, incarcerated girls and their families are not routinely informed ofthe existence of the office nor provided with its contact information.Effective external oversight of juvenile facilities exists in otherstates in the United States.For example, facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and RhodeIsland are monitored by independent state Offices ofthe Child Advocate. A bill to create such an office in New York is currently pending.[677] The absence of aneffective, independent complaints mechanism to investigate abuse, particularly seriousallegations of physical or sexual abuse, is a violation of the U.S.'sinternational legal obligations.Barriers to Monitoring by Civil SocietyThe big black hole in New York seems to be when kids are sentupstate. We don't know what's going on in the juvenile justice system, there'sthat black hole. We get a few reports from people, anecdotes, then someconversations with people at Legal Aid, who see juveniles only at the pointthey emerge for an extension hearing.[678]Civil society organizations that might be expected to act as watchdogsand assist in monitoring conditions in NewYork's juvenile facilities cannot effectively do so.For example, there exists no external agency with legislative authority toinspect juvenile prisons, although the Correctional Association of New York hashad such authority as to adult prisons since the nineteenth century.[679]There exists no juvenile equivalent of Prisoners'Legal Services of New York, a state funded civil legal services office servingadult inmates in New Yorkprisons. The Legal Aid Society (LAS), which represents about half of New York children indelinquency proceedings, is not even informed of the facility in which itsclients are ultimately placed, and except in hearings to determine whether achild's placement in an OCFS facility is to be extended, does not continuerepresenting children or maintain contact with children once they areincarcerated.[680]Statewide, no defense attorney or independent agency is funded toconduct oversight or advocacy concerning the conditions of confinement ofchildren in OCFS facilities.International standards specifically preserve the right of juveniles tocommunicate freely not only with family and friends but also with "otherpersons or representatives of reputable outside organizations."[681]Furthermore, children have the right to "request assistance from familymembers, legal counselors, humanitarian groups or others where possible, inorder to make a complaint."[682]Yet OCFS is often actively hostile to such outsiders.The institutional culture within OCFS isremarkably closed and self-protective, and OCFS has blocked efforts by outside investigatorsattempting to research conditions in its facilities. For example, a 2004 studyof girls' experiences in New YorkState's juvenile justicesystem identified the stubborn refusal of OCFS to permit any outside scrutinyof its operations as a "major issue" affecting incarcerated girls.[683]The researchers were denied access to all but one OCFS facility and even therewere prohibited from interviewing confined children.[684]They concluded: "The system is not open to inquiry and it is nearly impossibleto investigate issues and create viable solutions."[685]Likewise, researchers investigating the unmet needs of gay and lesbian childrenin foster care for a 2001 report found New York to be the "least responsive" of14 states to their requests for information, adding that OCFS's"failure to respond to our requests is emblematic of its inattention to theneeds of LGBT foster care youth."[686]The agency's culture has been described this way:Explicitly they have said donot speak to the media, it must go through us, the higher ups. And there are onoccasion people who are whistleblowers and they'll pay for it. . . . OCFS is one big family and theyall protect each other. It's insidious.[687]Asalready noted at the outset of this report, HRW/ACLU has met with a similarinstitutional culture of secrecy. OCFS repeatedly denied HRW/ACLU researchersaccess to the Lansing and Tryon facilities.[688] OCFS also delayed formonths before responding to HRW/ACLU's request for documents under New York's Freedom ofInformation Law, and disclosed documents containing thousands of complaints byincarcerated girls only after losing an administrative appeal made by HRW/ACLUto the agency's unfounded denial. It later produced approximately 6,000 additionalpages of documents partially responsive to HRW/ACLU's requests, but only after alengthy delay. Compromising information is redacted from these documents. Almostall attempts by HRW/ACLU to interview OCFS administrators and staff wererefused, and several attempts to contact knowledgeable OCFS employees were followedby calls from the agency's Office of Public Affairs insisting that allcommunications be directed to that office only.OCFS has also acted to prevent girls in its custody from communicatingtheir concerns to HRW/ACLU. Felicia H. received a flyer from HRW/ACLU regardingHRW/ACLU's research while she was being held at Tryon. She shared the flyer withother girls and wrote to HRW/ACLU about aspects of her experiences, includinghaving been subject to the restraint procedure. A sympathetic staff memberhelped her to compose her letters, but shortly after her release from Tryon,Felicia H. told HRW/ACLU:They caught on to the firstone that you sent me, the flyers and stuff, they thought you were trying to "setthem up," get them in trouble. What we [the girls] tell you about getting restrainedand stuff, you think that's what they [OCFS] tell people?[689]Felicia H.was questioned by a staff person about her contact with HRW/ACLU:I gave the [HRW/ACLUinformational] flyer to three or four other girls. They were interested but [a staffmember] told me not to show any more girls the flyers and not to communicateany more with you. I said someone has to let people know what's going on inthis place, I might as well do it. It's not even just me, there's a lot ofthem, they're scared to talk. If we rat on [staff], they make our stay therebad, they've got the keys, you understand? It makes it real bad for us.[690]Felicia H.feels that she was "restrained and treated bad" by a staff member forcommunicating with HRW/ACLU and with a Legal Aid Society attorney aboutconditions at Tryon.[691]In addition to contravening international standards concerning confinedchildren's contact with the outside world, the staff member's attempt to limitFelicia H.'s communication with HRW/ACLU violated agency regulations permittingchildren to "correspond with persons or organizations" subject only to"limitations necessary to maintain facility order and control."[692]The patternthat emerges is an almost complete lack of transparency within OCFS as to itsfacilities. In comparison with other states' juvenile justice agencies, andother agencies within New YorkState, OCFS is aprofoundly secretive institution. This culture of "heavy paranoia"[693]runs contrary to the important goals of transparency, accountability, andcooperation as well as international standards and, most importantly, theinterests of the girls and boys confined behind the walls of OCFS facilities.Appendix: Facilities InvestigatedTryonTryonGirlsCenter is located in Johnstown,New York, not far from Albany. Opened in 1987, it is classified overallas a maximum security institution for girls of up to 21 years of age who werefound to have committed crimes. Its capacity is 87 girls and its average dailypopulation is 75 girls. It has a staff of 120.[694]Thegirls held at Tryon are divided into units numbered from 50 to 55. Units 50 and51 are "secure," and the others are "non-secure." The housing units are arrangedin a semi-circle around a large open area with a gravel track and tenniscourts. On the grounds are also an administration building, a gym, and a cafeteria.Eachhousing unit contains a centrally located staff office. To one side of theoffice are small cinder block rooms for each girl with a metal-reinforcedwindow to the outside and enclosed by a solid metal door with a smallplexi-glass window, and to the other are a common area, bathrooms, and theso-called "mudroom."[695]TryonReceptionCenter is a part of the Tryoncomplex. Girls are held in Tryon Reception for two weeks for assessment priorto final placement in an OCFS facility or program. Also located in the samecomplex is TryonResidentialCenter,a medium security facility holding 217 boys between the ages of 14 and 18classified as juvenile delinquents.[696]-A boys unit in the Tryoncompound. The girls units look similar.2005 Mie Lewis/Human RightsWatch/ACLULansingLansingResidentialCenter is located in Lansing,New York, near Ithaca. The facility was opened in 1968. Itis classified as a medium security or limited secure facility. OCFS documentsdescribe limited secure facilities as "the most restrictive service settingsfor the Juvenile Delinquent population."[697]Lansing has acapacity of 113 and its average daily population is 80 girls of up to 18 yearsof age who were found to have committed crimes. It has a staff of 89.[698]Like Tryon, Lansingis divided into units. Girls in one unit can see girls in other units but arenot allowed to be in contact with them. Across the street from Lansing stands LouisGosset, Jr. Residential Center, a medium security 150-bed boys' facilityholding boys of up to 18 years of age.[699]Click to expand ImageGirls prepare to move fromone area of the Lansingfacility to another.2005 Mie Lewis/ Human Rights Watch/ACLUAcknowledgementsThis report was researched and written by Mie Lewis, AryehNeier fellow for Human Rights Watchand the American Civil Liberties Union.

The names ofall of the children we interviewed have been changed to protect their privacy.Because of the refusal of New York's Office of Children and Family Services topermit human rights monitoring of its facilities, making contact with currentlyand formerly incarcerated girls and others with first-hand knowledge offacilities conditions was a difficult endeavor, made possible only with thehelp of many people, including: Mishi Faruqee and Asadullah Mohammed of theCorrectional Association of New York, Marsha Weissman of the Center forCommunity Alternatives, and many others.Human Rights Watch and theAmerican Civil Liberties Union are grateful to the Open Society Institute forits support of the Aryeh Neier Fellowship.

OnOctober 31, 2005,HRW/ACLU sent separate written requests for access to the directors of theTryon and Lansing facilities. No response was received. After a follow-up callto the Lansingfacility, HRW/ACLU was telephoned by Brian Marchetti of the OCFS Public Affairs Office insisting thatHRW/ACLU no longer contact the facilities directly but contact only himinstead.HRW/ACLU made a follow-up call to the Tryon facility, and in response, on November 15, 2005, was referred to DianneDeacon of the OCFS Legal Department. In a letter dated November 23, 2005, Ms.Deacon denied the request for access based on "confidentiality considerations,"citing two provisions of New Yorklaw that, in fact, concern document confidentiality and are thereforeinapplicable to a request for facilities access. Six senior OCFS administratorswere sent copies of the letter by Ms. Deacon. On November 30, 2005, HRW/ACLUcontacted Ms. Deacon to discuss her letter. In subsequent discussions, Ms.Deacon approved arranging a meeting between HRW/ACLU and OCFS facilitiesadministrators to discuss access to the facilities, but indicated that theapproval of Brian Marchetti of the Public Affairs Office was also required.HRW/ACLU contacted Brian Marchetti and requested access to the facilities.In a telephone conversation of December 15,2005, Brian Marchetti stated that HRW/ACLU's request for access was denied,citing as his reason the desire not to distract OCFS administrators and stafffrom their daily tasks. HRW/ACLU requested that Mr. Marchetti put his refusalin writing. He refused to do so.On December 22, 2005, HRW/ACLU sent a written request for facilitiesaccess to OCFS Commissioner John Johnson. When a follow-up call was made, Mr.Johnson's assistant stated that the letter had never been received. On January3, 2006, HRW/ACLU faxed and resent the letter. When HRW/ACLU made a follow-up call on January 9, 2006, Mr. Johnson'sassistant stated that the request had been delegated to Inez Nievez, the Associate DeputyCommissioner for Programs and Services of OCFS's Division of RehabilitativeServices, and that Ms. Nievez wouldcontact HRW/ACLU later that day. Ms. Nievez never contacted HRW/ACLU. When, onJanuary 10, 2006, HRW/ACLU called the OCFS Commissioner's office seeking Ms.Nievez's contact information, OCFS staff refused to provide this information.On January 11, 2006, HRW/ACLU again telephoned the OCFS Commissioner's officeseeking to speak with Ms. Nievez.HRW/ACLU wasinformed that Ms. Nievez had referred the request for access to Sandra Brown ofthe OCFS Public Affairs Office. Later on January 11, 2006, HRW/ACLU wastelephoned by Sandra Brown and Brian Marchetti who stated that the request foraccess to the facilities was denied. In that conversation, Ms. Brown statedthat she was initially inclined to treat the request as a proposal to conductacademic research by forwarding it to the OCFS Bureau of Evaluation andResearch, "but then I looked at the FOIL [i.e. a request for documentssubmitted by HRW/ACLU under New York's Freedom of Information Law] and decided,'She's working on something.'"On February 28,2006, HRW/ACLU sent a written request to OCFS Commissioner John Johnson requestinga meeting to discuss the ongoing research and the issue of facilities access.Only after the intervention of two concerned state assemblymembers did a onehour meeting take place on April 18, 2006 between HRW/ACLU and eight seniorOCFS administrators including Commissioner Johnson. At that meeting, HRW/ACLUprovided information about our research and again requested access to thefacilities. Mr. Johnson replied, "We'll get back to you. There are some strongmeasures of confidentiality." On May 2, 2006, HRW/ACLU telephoned Mr. Johnson'sto follow up on the request for access. The following day, HRW/ACLU received acall from Sandra Brown of the OCFS Public Affairs Office. Ms. Brown stated thatHRW/ACLU should not contact the OCFS Commissioner's office and should directinquiries to the Public Affairs Office. When HRW/ACLU reiterated its requestfor access, Ms. Brown stated that she would "talk to the Commissioner and two otherpeople" who had attended the April 18, 2006 meeting, and would then, "let youknow." On May 5, 2006,Ms. Brown telephoned HRW/ACLU and stated that the request for access wasdenied. Ms. Brown then directed HRW/ACLU to submit a research proposal to the OCFSBureau of Evaluation and Research, the office to which Ms. Brown had originallycontemplated directing HRW/ACLU's request for access before concluding thatHRW/ACLU were "working on something." HRW/ACLU explained that this would not bean appropriate course of action because the Bureau of Evaluation and Researchevaluates proposals for social scientific research, but Ms. Brown insisted thatthis was the only course of action available.On May 12, 2006,HRW/ACLU sent a written request to OCFS Commissioner Johnson urging him toreconsider his denial of HRW/ACLU's request for access to the facilities. OnMay 22, 2006, Mr. Johnson responded by letter directing HRW/ACLU to submit arequest for access to OCFS's Bureau of Evaluation and Research. HRW/ACLUcontacted the Bureau and was informed that the Bureau evaluates only proposalsfor scientific research conducted "through a university," containing a"research hypothesis," and approved by a formal Institutional Review Board.Likewise, the "Instructions to Researchers for Submitting a Research Proposalfor OCFS Review" provided to HRW/ACLU by the Bureau contemplates socialscientific research, requiring "an approval letter from a federally recognizedInstitutional Review Board," as well as submissions, such as a "samplingapproach" and an "analytic approach," characteristic of academic research. OnJune 12, 2006, HRW/ACLU sent a letter to OCFS Commissioner Johnson detailingthe history of contacts between HRW/ACLU, explaining again the nature ofHRW/ACLU's research, and urging Mr. Johnson to reconsider his rejection ofHRW/ACLU's request for facilities access. The letter requested in thealternative that Mr. Johnson provide HRW/ACLU with assurance that, given thenature of HRW/ACLU's research, a request for access would properly be directedto the Bureau of Evaluation and Research and that the qualitative nature of theresearch would not preclude approval. Mr. Johnson responded in a letterproviding no assurances but simply repeating the instruction that HRW/ACLUsubmit a request to the Bureau of Evaluation and Research.[3] The number of entriesper year, per facility, is as follows: Tryon: 435 in 2003, 452 in 2004, 411 in2005; Lansing: 976 in 2003, 1082 in 2004, 1385 in 2005.

In any event, the laws of the U.S. and itsstates as well as their implementation must be consistent with the ICCPR. Thisfollows directly from Article 6 section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. As a matterof international law as well, reservations to treaties may not contradict theobject and purpose of the treaty at issue.

Human Rights Committee, responsible for interpreting and monitoringcompliance with the ICCPR, has stated that reservations or interpretivedeclarations should not "seek to remove an autonomous meaning to Covenantobligations, by pronouncing them to be identical, or to be accepted only in sofar as they are identical, with existing provisions of domestic law."

In addition, the U.S.has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children,child prostitution and child pornography and is thus specifically bound toprotect the rights and interests of incarcerated girls who were previouslycommercially sexually exploited.

In 2004, 21 percent of childrenin New YorkState lived in poverty and 35 percentlived in families where no parent had full-time, year-round employment,compared with a 33 percent national average for children whose parents lackfull-time, year-round employment.

A glance at news headlines showsthat a heightened risk of juvenile incarceration due to poor intra-agencycoordination is only one symptom of broader failings in New York's foster care system.Administrative disorganization and cripplingly large caseloads throughout alllevels of OCFS in New Yorkhave been cited by both government officials and outside observers ascontributors to tragedies in recent years. One example is the well-publicizedcase of Nixmary Brown, a seven-year old who was beaten to death by herstepfather only weeks after contact with city workers.
