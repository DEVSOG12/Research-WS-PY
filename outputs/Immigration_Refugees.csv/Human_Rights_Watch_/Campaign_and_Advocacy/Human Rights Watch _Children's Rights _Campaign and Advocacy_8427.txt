Already, the program has had extraordinary impact. A new Columbia University study found that the payments have lifted three million children out of poverty, and the number of families reporting food insecurity has dropped by a third. Most families report using the payments for basic needs, including food, housing, children’s clothing, and other essentials, as well as saving for emergencies.But the child tax credit is under fire, with proposals to cut the benefits, or reduce the number of those eligible, including those families that need it most.Children’s right to an adequate standard of living is well established under international human rights law. All children should be able to live in dignity and have their basic needs met.Child stipends also are one of the best investments governments can make. Their long-term impact is to increase children’s earning potential, improve their health, their education, and reduce their involvement with the criminal justice system and reliance on social services. Columbia’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy estimates that making the child tax credit permanent would cost $100 billion per year, but yield $800 billion annually in societal benefits. It could cut child poverty in the US by 40 percent, with the greatest benefit for children of color, who are more likely to live in poverty.Congress should ensure critical social safety nets for the lowest-income and most marginalized households. By making the child tax credit permanent, the US government has the chance to transform millions of children’s lives, now and in the future. It should seize the opportunity.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights Poverty and InequalityMore ReadingSeptember 30, 2021DispatchesUS Government Should End Child Labor at HomeJuly 27, 2021DispatchesVictory Against Child Marriage in New York StateReportsApril 12, 2022Report“If I’m Out of Insulin, I’m Going to Die”United States’ Lack of Regulation Fuels Crisis of Unaffordable InsulinJanuary 27, 2022Report“The Tenant Never Wins”Private Takeover of Public Housing Puts Rights at Risk in New York CityMore ReadingSeptember 30, 2021DispatchesUS Government Should End Child Labor at HomeJuly 27, 2021DispatchesVictory Against Child Marriage in New York StateMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
