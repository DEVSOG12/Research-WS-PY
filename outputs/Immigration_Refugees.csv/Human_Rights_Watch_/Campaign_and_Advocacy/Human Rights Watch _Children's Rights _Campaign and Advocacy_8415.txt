On tobacco farms, children work long hours in extreme heat, exposed to nicotine and toxic pesticides that can make them sick. In Africa, Asia, and Latin America, child laborers in artisanal and small-scale gold mines work underground in pits that easily collapse and use toxic mercury to process the gold, risking brain damage and other serious health conditions. We are working to end the worst forms of child labor and to ensure that all children are protected from jobs that interfere with their health, safety, and education.United StatesSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionCallie King-GuffeyPublished in:Sun SentinelUnited StatesSeptember 13, 2022News ReleaseUS States Fail to Protect Children’s RightsUnited StatesJuly 21, 2022Dispatches46 Congressmembers Urge US to Protect Child FarmworkersMargaret WurthSenior Researcher, Children's Rights DivisionVideosWatch moreVideosCovid-19's Impact on Children's RightsKids Talk Covid and SchoolsEuropean Parliament Should Vote to Respect Human RightsReportsMore reportsMay 26, 2021Report“I Must Work to Eat”Covid-19, Poverty, and Child Labor in Ghana, Nepal, and UgandaNovember 24, 2020ReportSparkling Jewels, Opaque Supply ChainsJewelry Companies, Changing Sourcing Practices, and Covid-19June 11, 2019Report“There Is Enormous Suffering”Serious Abuses Against Talibé Children in Senegal, 2017-2018April 5, 2018ReportA Bitter HarvestChild Labor and Human Rights Abuses on Tobacco Farms in ZimbabweNewsSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalSeptember 13, 2022News ReleaseUS States Fail to Protect Children’s RightsNew Scorecard Gives Only 4 a ‘C’ Grade; 46 Get ‘D’ or ‘F’July 21, 2022Dispatches46 Congressmembers Urge US to Protect Child FarmworkersLetter to Labor Secretary Calls for Overdue Child Labor ReformsJuly 15, 2022StatementJoint Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in advance of its review of the United States of America107th SessionJune 13, 2022DispatchesOn World Day Against Child Labor, US Should Protect Young FarmworkersLawmakers, Labor Department Need to ActMarch 31, 2022News ReleaseUS: Congress Should Protect Child FarmworkersBill Would Close Loopholes in US Labor LawMarch 9, 2022StatementSubmission to the Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human RightsMercury, Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold MiningSeptember 30, 2021DispatchesUS Government Should End Child Labor at HomeFarmworker Children Under 18 Need Better ProtectionJune 16, 2021News ReleaseAfrica: Prioritize Education to Safeguard Children’s RightsGuarantee Free Education for All; Tackle AbusesJune 11, 2021News ReleaseGermany: New Supply Chain Law a Step in the Right DirectionLaw’s Gaps Should be Fixed by Next GovernmentJune 10, 2021DispatchesSurging Child Labor Demands Government ActionNew Global Numbers Show Backsliding Even Before Covid-19 PandemicRead MoreDaily BriefOct 27, 2022Islamists’ Killing Spree in northeast Mali; Escalating Atrocities in Ethiopia; Russia Using Facial Recognition to Hunt Draft Evaders; Take Note; Reader Tip: Business and Human Rights; Quote of the Day: Xinjiang.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
