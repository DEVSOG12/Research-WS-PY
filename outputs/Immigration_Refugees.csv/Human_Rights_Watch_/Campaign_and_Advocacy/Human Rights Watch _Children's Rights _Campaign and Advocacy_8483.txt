Prior to this change, Altria Group deferred to US labor law for the minimum age to work, which allows children as young as 12 to work unlimited hours outside of school on a farm of any size, and has no minimum age for children to work on small farms.“Altria Group has taken an important step toward protecting younger children from the dangers of tobacco farming,” said Margaret Wurth, children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The company should continue updating its child labor policy to protect all children from nicotine exposure and other serious health and safety risks.”Human Rights Watch in a May 2014 report found that child tobacco workers on US farms are exposed to nicotine, toxic pesticides, extreme heat, and other dangers. Most of the children interviewed reported nausea, vomiting, headaches, and dizziness – all symptoms of acute nicotine poisoning.Altria Group will also require parental consent for children under 18 working in tobacco farming. Both changes to the company’s child labor standards will not cover children working on family farms.The changes will be contractual requirements for all growers selling tobacco to Altria Group in 2015.Reynolds American, parent of R.J. Reynolds, the second-largest US tobacco company and one of Altria Group’s main competitors, does not have a child labor policy.Human Rights Watch has urged 10 of the world’s largest tobacco companies, including Altria Group and Reynolds American, to strengthen their child labor policies to protect all children under 18 from hazardous work on tobacco farms in their global supply chains, including any work involving direct contact with tobacco in any form.Altria Group already prohibits tobacco workers under 18 from performing hazardous work, as defined by US law and regulations. However, US regulations lack any provisions to protect children from the risks of handling tobacco.Some of the world’s largest tobacco companies, such as Philip Morris International, have definitions of hazardous work that are more protective than most national regulatory frameworks, but a clear industry-wide standard is needed, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch noted that current international standards defer to national regulations – which are often inadequate and leave children at risk – to determine what tasks are considered hazardous.On December 10, the Eliminating Child Labor in Tobacco Growing (ECLT) Foundation announced that its members – which include Altria Group and several other large international tobacco companies – made a commitment to end child labor in their global supply chains in line with international labor law.Human Rights Watch has also urged Congress and the Obama administration to strengthen US laws and regulations to protect children from the hazards of tobacco farming.“Even with the tobacco industry’s recent push toward higher standards, none of the companies have policies that sufficiently protect children from the hazards of tobacco farming,” Wurth said.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights Child LaborMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalMost ViewedOctober 27, 2022ReportMali: Coordinated Massacres by Islamist Armed GroupsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceShare this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
