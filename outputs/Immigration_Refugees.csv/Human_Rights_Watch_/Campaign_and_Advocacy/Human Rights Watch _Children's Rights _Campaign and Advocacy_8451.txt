Many parents of child tobacco workers are themselves poorly paid farmworkers. There is no question that the families need the money.Click to expand ImageA 16-year-old tobacco worker standing in a tobacco field in North Carolina wearing her work clothes. “I don’t feel any different in the fields than when I was 12,” she said. “I [still] get headaches and … my stomach hurts. And like I feel nauseous…. I just feel like my stomach is like rumbling around. I feel like I’m gonna throw up.”© 2015 Benedict Evans for Human Rights WatchBut that is all the more reason why we shouldn’t let the United States government and tobacco companies off the hook for this dangerous child labor. Tobacco farming exposes children to nicotine, toxic pesticides, extreme heat, and other dangers that could have long-term consequences on their health. These toxins pose special dangers to children with developing brains and bodies. Child labor can also interfere with schooling and lock children into low-wage, low-opportunity jobs, trapping children in a cycle of poverty.Over the last three years, I’ve interviewed more than 100 child tobacco workers and very few of them had received education or training about the dangers of the work or how harmful it could be for them in the long-term. We know much more now than we ever have about the dangers of nicotine, and our public policies should catch up with scientific evidence.It’s the job of policymakers to prohibit children from activities that could harm their health or safety. It’s also the job of the companies buying tobacco from US farmers to ensure that there are no human rights abuses in their supply chains.The Washington Post Magazine article brought an important issue to the attention of many readers who probably never knew children too young to legally buy a pack of cigarettes are cultivating and harvesting tobacco in the US. But I fear some readers might have come away believing that child labor on tobacco farms is an inevitable symptom of poverty, and a problem that can’t be fixed. Tobacco companies, the Obama administration, and Congress can fix this problem, and the fact that children are suffering harm because they need the money is all the more reason why they urgently need protection.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States US Poverty and Economic InequalityTopicEconomic Justice and Rights Children's Rights Child Labor HealthMore ReadingOctober 13, 2022DispatchesThe Right to Housing is on the Ballot in Los AngelesOctober 12, 2022News ReleaseUS: Public Housing Eviction Concerns in New MexicoReportsSeptember 27, 2022Report“We Deserve to Have a Place to Live”How US Underfunding Public Housing Harms Rights in New York, New Mexico, and BeyondApril 12, 2022Report“If I’m Out of Insulin, I’m Going to Die”United States’ Lack of Regulation Fuels Crisis of Unaffordable InsulinMore ReadingOctober 13, 2022DispatchesThe Right to Housing is on the Ballot in Los AngelesOctober 12, 2022News ReleaseUS: Public Housing Eviction Concerns in New MexicoMost ViewedOctober 27, 2022ReportMali: Coordinated Massacres by Islamist Armed GroupsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceShare this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
