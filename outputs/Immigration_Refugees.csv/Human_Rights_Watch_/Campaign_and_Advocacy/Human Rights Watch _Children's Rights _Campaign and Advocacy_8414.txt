These boys and girls, some as young as 8 years old, serve in government forces and armed opposition groups. They may fight on the front lines, participate in suicide missions, and act as spies, messengers, or lookouts. Girls may be forced into sexual slavery. Many are abducted or recruited by force, while others join out of desperation, believing that armed groups offer their best chance for survival. We are working to prevent the use of child soldiers and to hold accountable the people who send children to fight.©2013 Marcus Bleasdale/VII for Human Rights WatchUS Foreign PolicyOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionMiddle East/North AfricaApril 19, 2022DispatchesHouthis Commit to End Violations Against Children in YemenJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionGlobalDecember 17, 2021DispatchesSome Progress for Children Despite Pandemic’s TollJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionVideosWatch moreVideosISIS Child Suspects Arbitrarily Arrested, Tortured in IraqSouth Sudan: Warring Parties Break Promises on Child SoldiersThree Years After ICC Warrant Issued, FDLR Leader Still At LargeReportsMore reportsMarch 6, 2019Report“Everyone Must Confess”Abuses against Children Suspected of ISIS Affiliation in IraqJanuary 8, 2019ReportKurdistan Region of Iraq: Detained Children TorturedBeatings, Electric Shock to Coerce ISIS ConfessionsJune 15, 2018ReportYemen: Key Concerns for Hodeida BattlePoor Record of Coalition and Houthi Indiscriminate Attacks and Aid RestrictionsFebruary 5, 2018ReportSouth Sudan: Warring Parties Break Promises on Child SoldiersUN, AU Need to Impose Sanctions, Get Court RunningNewsOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersBut 4 Countries Recruiting Children Will Still Receive US Military AidApril 19, 2022DispatchesHouthis Commit to End Violations Against Children in YemenPledge Comes Amidst Ceasefire in Prolonged ConflictDecember 17, 2021DispatchesSome Progress for Children Despite Pandemic’s TollTen Points to Celebrate from 2021September 29, 2021News ReleaseMozambique: ISIS-linked Group Using Child SoldiersChildren Trained to Fight, Deployed Against Government ForcesSeptember 20, 2021CommentaryThis is our opportunity to end the Taliban's use of child soldiersJune 22, 2021News ReleaseAfghanistan: Children Detained, Tortured for Insurgent LinksGovernment, UN, Donors Should Ensure ReintegrationJune 16, 2021News ReleaseAfrica: Prioritize Education to Safeguard Children’s RightsGuarantee Free Education for All; Tackle AbusesJanuary 27, 2021Q & AQ&A: The LRA Commander Dominic Ongwen and the ICCJanuary 27, 2021WitnessHow to Hold a Former Child Soldier Accountable?Dominic Ongwen, Kidnapped by the LRA at Age 10, to Face ICC JudgmentNovember 30, 2020StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child’s Review of South Sudan88th pre-sessionJune 29, 2020DispatchesRecord Number of Countries on US Child Soldier Blacklist14 Governments Face Possible Military SanctionsMay 25, 2020DispatchesStop Backsliding on Use of Child SoldiersTreaty’s 20th Anniversary Shows Uneven Progress, Need for ImprovementRead MoreDaily BriefOct 27, 2022Islamists’ Killing Spree in northeast Mali; Escalating Atrocities in Ethiopia; Russia Using Facial Recognition to Hunt Draft Evaders; Take Note; Reader Tip: Business and Human Rights; Quote of the Day: Xinjiang.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
