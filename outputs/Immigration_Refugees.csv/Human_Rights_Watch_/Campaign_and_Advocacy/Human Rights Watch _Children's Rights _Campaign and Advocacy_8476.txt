The bill will next be heard by the state senate, where 21 votes are needed to pass. The senate is expected take up the matter this week.(Los Angeles) – The California state assembly is considering a bill that would require a consultation with a lawyer for anyone under the age of 18 before they can waive their Miranda rights and be questioned, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch released a video about a police interrogation of a child in a murder case and the need to provide children with extra legal protection to reduce the chance of coerced confessions.California Senate Bill 1052 (Lara), which Human Rights Watch has sponsored, would provide extra protection for children in the custody of the police. It is based on research that shows the reduced capacity of children to comprehend complex legal issues and to appreciate the consequences of their actions. The bill would in effect give children assistance so they would have parity with adults in making important decisions about waiving their rights to remain silent and speaking to the police without an attorney.“Senate Bill 1052 is designed to ensure youth in difficult situations are not alone, but have a knowledgeable adult to help them understand their basic constitutional rights,” said Elizabeth Calvin, senior children’s rights advocate at Human Rights Watch. “The pressure to confess during an interrogation can be immense, and no child should waive their rights because they don’t understand the consequences of the decision.”The pressure to confess during an interrogation can be immense, and no child should waive their rights because they don’t understand the consequences of the decisionElizabeth CalvinSenior children's rights advocateIn recent years, the state of California has enacted a number of laws providing safeguards for youth in the criminal justice system. These laws recognize widely accepted developmental and neurological evidence about youth that have shown that their capacity to grasp legal rights is less than that of an adult.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States US Foreign PolicyTopicChildren's Rights Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsReportsMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisJanuary 6, 2021Report“Like I’m Drowning”Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramMore ReadingOctober 11, 2022DispatchesUS Stops Funding Some Militaries Using Child SoldiersSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsMost ViewedOctober 27, 2022ReportMali: Coordinated Massacres by Islamist Armed GroupsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceShare this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
