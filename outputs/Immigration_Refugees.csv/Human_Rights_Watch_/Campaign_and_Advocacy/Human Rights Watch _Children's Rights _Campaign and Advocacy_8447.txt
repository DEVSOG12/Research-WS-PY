Governor Kay Ivey should veto the bill and send a clear message that Alabama will protect vulnerable children by prioritizing their well-being and finding them a loving home.The bill, HB 24, would set a terrible precedent. Its sweeping language would invite agencies to discriminate based on the religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status of would-be parents. It would allow agencies to make decisions without considering how their bias could run roughshod over the rights of foster or adoptive parents, or the state’s ability to place children in loving homes. For example, a same-sex couple that approaches an agency offering a safe, loving home for a child could be turned away because the agency opposes same-sex relationships on religious grounds.By restricting enforcement of existing laws, HB 24 would also severely limit the state’s control and oversight over child placements. Approximately 30 percent of child placement agencies in Alabama are faith-based organizations, and HB 24 would prohibit the state from withholding funding or licenses if those organizations discriminate. It would undermine laws designed to put the best interest of the child at the forefront of placement decisions, and would tie the state’s hands as it tries to place children with families who can care for them.In March, South Dakota enacted a similar law, prompting a firestorm of criticism from children’s and LGBT advocates. North Dakota, Michigan, and Virginia have similar exemptions in place.Yet most states that have considered religious exemptions in child placement have decided not to adopt them. Efforts to update Georgia’s adoption laws faltered this spring after legislators inserted religious exemptions into the bill. Governor Nathan Deal threatened to veto the amended legislation and criticized lawmakers for putting discrimination before the best interests of children.As HB 24 heads to her desk, Ivey has a similar opportunity to put Alabama’s children first. The bill’s exceptions for religiously motivated prejudice are baseless, discriminatory, and dangerous. By vetoing HB 24, Ivey can help ensure that Alabama will not allow prejudice to stand in the way of placing vulnerable children in safe, healthy, and loving homes.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicChildren's Rights LGBT RightsMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseUS: Anti-Trans Bills Also Harm Intersex ChildrenSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsReportsNovember 18, 2021Report“I Just Try to Make It Home Safe”Violence and the Human Rights of Transgender People in the United StatesMarch 11, 2021Report“The Only People It Really Affects Are the People It Hurts”The Human Rights Consequences of Parental Notice of Abortion in IllinoisMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseUS: Anti-Trans Bills Also Harm Intersex ChildrenSeptember 14, 2022StatementUS: Testimony Before the House Committee on Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce ProtectionsMost ViewedOctober 27, 2022ReportMali: Coordinated Massacres by Islamist Armed GroupsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022DispatchesNew UK Prime Minister’s Cabinet Raises Rights ConcernsNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceShare this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
