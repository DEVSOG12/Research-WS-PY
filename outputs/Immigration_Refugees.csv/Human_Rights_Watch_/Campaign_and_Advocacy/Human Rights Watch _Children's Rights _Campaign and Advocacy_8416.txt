In many countries, children are charged and sentenced for acts that should not be crimes—such as truancy or misbehavior at home. Some states set a minimum age of criminal responsibility lower than the internationally acceptable age of 14. Some states also treat certain children, especially older adolescents or children who are accused of particularly serious crimes, as if they were adults during their trial and sentencing. Sentences of death, life without parole, and corporal punishment are still handed down in some countries, in violation of international law. The international prohibition on detaining children with adults is also often violated.© 2007 Associated PressAfricaOctober 3, 2022DispatchesNigeria Agrees to End Military Detention of ChildrenJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionUnited StatesSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalJo BeckerAdvocacy Director, Children's Rights DivisionCallie King-GuffeyPublished in:Sun SentinelUnited StatesSeptember 13, 2022News ReleaseUS States Fail to Protect Children’s RightsVideosWatch moreVideos1.5 Million Kids Locked Up Each Year Around the WorldReportsMore reportsJune 30, 2020Report“You Have No Right to Complain”Education, Social Restrictions, and Justice in Taliban-Held AfghanistanJune 18, 2020Report“They Talk to Us Like We’re Dogs”Abusive Police Stops in FranceMarch 23, 2020Report“No One Cared He Was A Child”Egyptian Security Forces’ Abuse of Children in DetentionJanuary 8, 2019ReportKurdistan Region of Iraq: Detained Children TorturedBeatings, Electric Shock to Coerce ISIS ConfessionsNewsOctober 3, 2022DispatchesNigeria Agrees to End Military Detention of ChildrenPledges Swift Reintegration Support for Boko Haram SuspectsSeptember 13, 2022CommentaryThe US Record on Protecting Our Children Is AbysmalSeptember 13, 2022News ReleaseUS States Fail to Protect Children’s RightsNew Scorecard Gives Only 4 a ‘C’ Grade; 46 Get ‘D’ or ‘F’March 4, 2022DispatchesThe UK Sees No Evil in Bahrain’s Detention of ChildrenLaw Reforms Have Done Little to Stem AbusesFebruary 17, 2022DispatchesIraq Detains More than 1,000 Children as ISIS SuspectsChildren Should be Reintegrated, Not Face ProsecutionDecember 17, 2021DispatchesSome Progress for Children Despite Pandemic’s TollTen Points to Celebrate from 2021October 28, 2021DispatchesSaudi Arabia Finally Frees Alleged Child OffenderOthers Remain in Prison Under Abusive Justice SystemMarch 24, 2021DispatchesBangladesh Police Arrest Children for Facebook PostsStop Using Vague Law to Silence Criticism of Prime MinisterFebruary 11, 2021DispatchesSaudi Arabia Drops Death Sentence Against Child ProtestorsUrgent Need for More Reform to Prevent Future AbusesOctober 13, 2020StatementHuman Rights Watch Submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on Egypt79th Pre-SessionSeptember 30, 2020News ReleaseCalifornia: New Law Protects Children in Police CustodyRequires Attorney Consultation on RightsAugust 31, 2020DispatchesSaudi Arabia Reviews Child Death Penalty CasesGovernment Should End All Executions, Protect Children from AbuseRead MoreDaily BriefOct 27, 2022Islamists’ Killing Spree in northeast Mali; Escalating Atrocities in Ethiopia; Russia Using Facial Recognition to Hunt Draft Evaders; Take Note; Reader Tip: Business and Human Rights; Quote of the Day: Xinjiang.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
