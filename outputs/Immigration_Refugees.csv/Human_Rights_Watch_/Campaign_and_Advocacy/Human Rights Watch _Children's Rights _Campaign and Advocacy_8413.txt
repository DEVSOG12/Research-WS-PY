In many regions, armed groups intentionally target schools, teachers, and students. These attacks violate the rights of the child: in addition to putting children at risk of injury or death, they can thwart students' chance to get an education. Attacks on schools, teachers, and students can cause children to drop out or go to school less often, force schools to cut their hours, and destroy school buildings and materials. In environments of violence and fear, the quality of children's education is severely diminished. Human Rights Watch defines "attacks on education" as encompassing the full range of violations that place children at risk and deny them access to education. This includes attacks on school infrastructure and on teachers and students; the occupation of schools by the police and military; harassment and threats against teachers, parents, and students; and the recruitment of children from schools to become soldiers. Human Rights Watch calls on states to endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, an international commitment to protect schools and universities from being attacked or used for military purposes in times of armed conflict.@2009 Bede Sheppard/Human Rights WatchGlobalOctober 19, 2022DispatchesAll Children Have a Right to Pre-Primary EducationBede SheppardDeputy Director, Children's Rights DivisionEurope/Central AsiaOctober 3, 2022DispatchesKyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Conflict Leaves Children without EducationSyinat SultanalievaResearcher, Europe and Central Asia DivisionAfghanistanJuly 8, 2022InteractiveFighting the Taliban’s Ban on Girls’ EducationVideosWatch moreVideosCameroon: School AttacksVideo: Girls’ Lives Shattered by Attacks on Schools in DR Congo during Kasai ConflictVideo: Cameroon in CrisisReportsMore reportsJune 27, 2022ReportCameroon: Separatist Abuses in Anglophone RegionsProsecute, Sanction Fighters for Crimes Against CiviliansMarch 20, 2022ReportFour Ways to Support Girls’ Access to Education in AfghanistanLessons for donors from Afghan students, teachers, and principalsDecember 16, 2021Report“They Are Destroying Our Future”Armed Separatist Attacks on Students, Teachers, and Schools in Cameroon’s Anglophone RegionsMay 28, 2021ReportEthiopia: Tigray Schools Occupied, LootedProtect Students, Teachers in Region; Endorse Safe Schools DeclarationNewsOctober 19, 2022DispatchesAll Children Have a Right to Pre-Primary EducationUN Education Expert Recommends New Education TreatyOctober 3, 2022StatementThailand: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women85th Pre-sessionOctober 3, 2022DispatchesKyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Conflict Leaves Children without EducationBoth Countries Should Endorse Safe Schools DeclarationSeptember 21, 2022StatementArmenia: Submissionto the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women83rd SessionAugust 19, 2022StatementSouth Sudan: Submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child91st SessionAugust 19, 2022StatementPhilippines: Submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child91st SessionAugust 15, 2022StatementPhilippines: Submission to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights71st Pre-SessionJuly 13, 2022StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child Review of Mauritius91st Pre-sessionJuly 13, 2022StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child Review of New Zealand91st Pre-sessionJuly 13, 2022StatementSubmission to the Committee on the Rights of the Child Review of São Tomé and Príncipe91st Pre-sessionJune 27, 2022ReportCameroon: Separatist Abuses in Anglophone RegionsProsecute, Sanction Fighters for Crimes Against CiviliansJune 1, 2022News ReleaseAttacks on Education Increased Worldwide During PandemicMore than 5,000 Attacks in Past 2 YearsRead MoreDaily BriefOct 27, 2022Islamists’ Killing Spree in northeast Mali; Escalating Atrocities in Ethiopia; Russia Using Facial Recognition to Hunt Draft Evaders; Take Note; Reader Tip: Business and Human Rights; Quote of the Day: Xinjiang.Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
