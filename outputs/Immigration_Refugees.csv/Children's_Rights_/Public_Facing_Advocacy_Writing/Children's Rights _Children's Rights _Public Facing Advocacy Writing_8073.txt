Children’s Rights Executive Director, Sandy Santana, released the following statement:“It is shocking that the Trump Administration enacted this policy with no attempt to develop the infrastructure and processes that could track and eventually reunite these children. We are not talking about commodities. These are kids, and we owe these families – and the American public – the full and accurate count of the number of separated children and their whereabouts today. Even amidst the government shutdown, Congress must make getting concrete answers an absolute and urgent priority.”Further Reading:Read the HHS report here.New York Times: “Thousands More Migrant Children Were Probably Taken From Families Than Reported“Reuters: “U.S. separated ‘thousands’ more immigrant children than known: watchdog“###Stay informed!
