In August 2020, Children’s Rights filed an amicus brief in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia urging SCOTUS to uphold Philadelphia’s non-discrimination policy, arguing that otherwise children in child welfare could be denied a loving foster home based solely on the religious beliefs of adoption agencies.In response, Christina Wilson Remlin, lead counsel at Children’s Rights, issued the following statement:The Supreme Court’s 9 – 0 ruling is based on narrow grounds limited to the facts of this case. The Supreme Court held that Philadelphia’s non-discrimination requirement in foster care contracts was not generally applicable because the contracts provided for a mechanism of individualized exemptions at the sole discretion of the City’s child welfare Commissioner. We are disappointed that the ruling allows CSS to use taxpayer funds to discriminate against LGBTQ+ couples and sends a message to LGBTQ+ children that their rights are not protected and their identities are not valued — but we are gratified that the national implications are limited. The court’s decision drives home why we need to pass federal legislation to provide consistent anti-discrimination protections for all LGBTQ+ people and, additionally, legislation to protect the dignity of youth in child welfare systems by ending discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.NewsroomPress ReleasesMedia KitPublicationsFact SheetsAging OutChild Abuse and NeglectChild Mental HealthChild Sex TraffickingFinding Permanent FamiliesFoster CareBlogVideosOur MissionWhat We DoYour RightsJoin UsTake ActionDonate NowStay in the KnowStoreNYC BenefitMediaBlogPress ReleasesIn the NewsPublicationsVideosOur Impact2021 Impact ReportClass ActionsOur StoriesTales of Strength & LoveAbout UsEmploymentAnnual Report and Privacy PolicyContact UsDonate NowFacebook Twitter YouTubeDonate Now© 2022 Children’s Rights.
