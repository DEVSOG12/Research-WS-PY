Sandy Santana, Executive Director of Children’s Rights, issued this statement:“This cruel expansion of the public charge rule is yet another unconscionable attack on immigrant families, and unfortunately, once again it is vulnerable children who will suffer the consequences. Our federal government continues to punish immigrants by targeting children, endangering the well-being of thousands of kids whose families may now be too afraid to access basic health, nutrition, and housing services for fear of the repercussions. No parent should be forced to choose between providing food, shelter and healthcare for their children and seeking a green card to live and work legally in the country. Like the separation of children and families, this new regulation is against our fundamental values and puts children at risk to advance Draconian immigration policies.”About Children’s Rights: Through strategic advocacy and legal action, Children’s Rights holds state governments accountable to America’s most vulnerable children.
