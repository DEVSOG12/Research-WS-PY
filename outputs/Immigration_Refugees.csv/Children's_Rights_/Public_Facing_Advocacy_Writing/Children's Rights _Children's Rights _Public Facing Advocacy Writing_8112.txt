Although other reports are available on DCF’s website, the department does not routinely publicize statistics on these crucial areas.“Right now DCF is far from transparent. If state leaders are serious about making foster care the safe haven that children deserve, it is imperative that they be open and honest about how kids are faring,” said Sara Bartosz, lead counsel at Children’s Rights. “We encourage DCF to post key performance data to its website, so the public can help to hold the system accountable.”The records request comes on the heels of an Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) report released this week containing troubling findings and recommendations for improvement to longstanding systemic deficiencies. According to the report, in 2014 OCA reviewed 290 supported allegations of abuse or neglect concerning 184 children in DCF custody. In its report, OCA also calls for “a more comprehensive and integrated process for authorizing and overseeing psychotropic medication for children in DCF custody.”The state’s high rate of maltreatment in care and large percentage of foster children prescribed psychotropic medications were highlighted in Connor B. v. Patrick. The lawsuit, filed in 2010 by Children’s Rights and Boston law firm Nutter McClennan & Fish LLP, alleged that DCF violates the constitutional rights of children in state care by placing them in dangerous and unstable situations.“Children’s Rights is deeply concerned that problems that were catalysts to our 2010 lawsuit still have not been cured,” said Bartosz. “There is no doubt that the Baker administration inherited a broken, dysfunctional system, but these children deserve accountability. Children’s Rights remains dedicated to the thousands of kids relying on the state to ensure their safety and well-being.”Although U.S. District Judge William Young ruled that the deficiencies of the system did not warrant injunctive relief, in his 2013 opinion he wrote that DCF “has failed not only to comport with national standards of care and state and federal requirements but also its own internal policies” for protecting and supporting children in foster care. He also noted a well-documented “laundry list of problems plaguing DCF” in areas including maltreatment in care, the inappropriate placement of children, providing medical services and caseload management and training.NewsroomPress ReleasesMedia KitPublicationsFact SheetsAging OutChild Abuse and NeglectChild Mental HealthChild Sex TraffickingFinding Permanent FamiliesFoster CareBlogVideosOur MissionWhat We DoYour RightsJoin UsTake ActionDonate NowStay in the KnowStoreNYC BenefitMediaBlogPress ReleasesIn the NewsPublicationsVideosOur Impact2021 Impact ReportClass ActionsOur StoriesTales of Strength & LoveAbout UsEmploymentAnnual Report and Privacy PolicyContact UsDonate NowFacebook Twitter YouTubeDonate Now© 2022 Children’s Rights.
