RepoRt 1During Children’s Rights’ 2013 Fostering the 
Future campaign, we posed that question to people who spent their childhoods in state care.
their voices came through loud and clear, and 
their answers didn’t surprise us.
they want the same reforms that Children’s 
Rights fights for every day.
They told us children don’t deserve to be shunted between foster homes, ripped from 
their brothers and sisters, or moved hundreds of miles from their communities just 
because they had to enter state care. They said kids need regular visits from caseworkers, 
quality mental health services, and safe, loving families.
“No child should endure what I had to endure – and there are thousands across the  
country just like me,” declared one young woman who lived in 20 places, was abused,  heavily medicated and went hungry during her years in foster care.
It is unconscionable for any child to be forced to live through such horror and pain. But all 
across the United States kids are suffering. Children’s Rights is not sitting idly by . W e are 
pursuing comprehensive legal campaigns to turn dangerous child welfare systems into safe 
havens for kids in need.
“ What W oulD you  
Change  
about fosteR CaRe?” 2During the past year,  we intensified our fight for children in Texas  – 
many of whom languish in state care as their hopes of living with permanent families 
dwindle. W e continued to advocate for kids in Rhode Island, who too often are placed 
in orphanage-like institutions instead of homes with families. And we banded together with local advocates to file a suit on behalf of a South Carolina boy who was sexually 
assaulted at an institution, then denied the mental health services he desperately needed 
to heal.
In the midst of these battles, Children’s Rights continued to press on in states where we’ve 
already secured court-ordered reforms. W e have monitored progress and held government officials accountable in Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, 
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Washington, D.C. and Wisconsin.
Recent reports show that a number of these systems are making the very changes called 
for by our former foster youth. In Metropolitan Atlanta, for example, frontline 
caseworkers made more than 98 percent of required visits with children. In Connecticut, 
officials reduced the number of children sent to out-of-state institutions by almost 90 
percent, from 324 in January , 2011 to just 38 in August, 2013. And in Tennessee, kids are 
being moved between foster homes less often – 93 percent had two or fewer placements in the last 12 months.  
Children’s Rights is improving foster care, but more work remains. More than 640,000 
kids spend time in care each year, and your support helps ensure more of them are safe and 
grow up in loving families.
Recently our sound financial practices earned our organization four stars, the highest 
rating given by Charity Navigator, America’s largest independent charity evaluator. So 
you can be confident that gifts to Children’s Rights are being used wisely . T ogether we can 
continue to build the hopes of foster youth and ensure abused and neglected kids are given the protection and care they deserve.

Much of Children’s Rights’ funding is derived from attorneys’ fees, which are not guaranteed and may 
take years to recover. Despite our impressive track record, it is critical that we diversify our funding 
through grants and contributions to ensure that we continue to improve the lives of thousands of kids.publIc support and revenue:
