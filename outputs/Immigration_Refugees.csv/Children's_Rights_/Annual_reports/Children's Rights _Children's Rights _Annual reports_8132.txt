Eric Thompson 3Protecting Kids. Providing Hope. 
Getting Results.
At a time when one in five kids in the United States of America lives in poverty, deep cuts 
to vital government programs — across nutrition, health, drug treatment and anti-poverty 
programs — threaten the very survival of our children. 
And with the opioid epidemic sweeping our nation, even more children are ending up in 
foster care, with stark increases disrupting a decade-long downward trend.
The U.S. government’s immigrant family separation policy is just the most recent example of 
the assault on the rights of children in America.
This year, Children’s Rights took a lead role in supporting the ACLU in a federal law suit 
seeking to reunite a mother and her seven-year-old daughter who fled violence in their home 
country. Ms. L presented herself at the border and said she was seeking asylum. But officials 
forcibly separated her and her daughter and detained them in facilities 2,000 miles apart. 
Our brief argues that the administration’s child separation policy is inhumane, 
unconstitutional, and violates national and international child welfare laws. Ms. L and 
her daughter are now back together — but a national class action law suit continues to 
permanently end this cruel practice. 
It is against this disturbing backdrop that Children’s Rights works to hold the government 
accountable for keeping kids safe and healthy. Every day, children are harmed by the 
very systems that are supposed to be caring for them. Kids are frequently separated from 
their parents without due process, or shuttled from one foster home to another. They are 
institutionalized in unsafe settings, denied basic health care benefits and incarcerated under 
inhumane and illegal conditions. 
In response, with your support, Children’s Rights uses strategic advocacy and legal action to 
stop the neglect and abuse of children: 
•  Child Separation and Detention: We are working with a coalition of state attorneys general 
who have taken legal action challenging the inhumane practice of child separation. 
•  Psychotropic Drugs / Solitary Confinement: In Iowa we have brought an important 
human rights case representing boys in juvenile detention who are being given powerful 
psychotropic drugs, held in solitary confinement and put in restraints that make it almost 
impossible to move.
•  LGBTQ Rights: We are launching a six-state effort advocating for laws and policies to 
protect the rights of LGBTQ youth, based on recommendations in a groundbreaking report 
that we published with Lambda Legal and the Center for the Study of Social Policy. 
•  Improving Child Welfare Systems: Our landmark Tennessee case has resulted in the 
wholesale overhaul of that state’s child welfare system, which is now seen as a model for the 
nation. And we continue to fight to make life better for 20,000 children in Arizona’s child 
welfare system as well as drive needed reforms in five other states. 
We must do all we can to protect children and families in these perilous times. They are 
depending on us — and you. Thank you for believing in us and supporting our work. 
Sincerely,
Megan Shattuck
