Eric Thompson 3Protecting Kids. Providing Hope. 
Getting Results.
COVID-19 has devastated so many lives. Each of us is struggling to a lesser or greater degree, 
in our own way. But for the thousands of children in government systems, the crisis has 
amplified the burdens they already faced. 
As the pandemic continues and the economy worsens, children whose families were already 
on the edge are facing increased poverty, poorer health outcomes, food and housing 
insecurity, and disrupted educations. 
This year has also laid bare the inherent racism and discrimination against Black and LGBTQ 
families and children in our state foster care and juvenile justice systems.
At this important and transformative moment, Children’s Rights brings 25 years of experience 
in protecting children and bringing them hope. 
2019 seems like a lifetime ago. In that year, our voice was loud in decrying practices that 
inflict harm on immigrant children. 
• We won a precedent-setting case in Missouri  that will stop the dangerous practice of 
giving children powerful psychotropic drugs without proper oversight and monitoring. 
• In South Carolina  our legal victory ends the practice of moving children night to night to 
hotels, offices, shelters or overcrowded foster homes. 
• Our Tennessee  case officially closed in 2019; it turned one of the worst foster care 
systems into a model for the nation.
• We launched a national coalition  to oppose discriminatory laws and policies that 
would reduce the number of foster homes available to children on the basis of religious 
freedom.
And today, in spite of the challenges the pandemic is posing for all of us, Children’s Rights 
has continued to fight to protect kids. Within days of grasping the severity of the crisis 
Children’s Rights began to establish a national triage movement. States have adopted our 
recommended protocols and contingencies for protecting the health and wellbeing of kids in 
high-risk environments such as group homes and juvenile justice facilities, and for youth aging 
out of foster care. We are lifting up concerns as we probe and hear of more problems, and 
putting pressure on governments and officials to address them.
In 2020, Children’s Rights was awarded a grant to study and recommend reforms that 
can advance racial equality by ending practices in the nation’s child abuse and neglect 
surveillance, investigation, and removal systems that reinforce structural racism, criminalize 
poverty and tear apart families of color. 
And our litigation work has gone on unabated against states that mistreat children in their 
care. In the last few months legal victories in Iowa and Kansas will make life better for over 
7,000 children in foster and juvenile justice systems. 
This is a difficult time for you, for me, for all of us.  But if there ever was a time to join 
together, the time is now. Let’s fight to protect children’s rights so they can see a brighter 
tomorrow. We all need a little hope.
Sincerely,
Sandy Santana
Executive Director
