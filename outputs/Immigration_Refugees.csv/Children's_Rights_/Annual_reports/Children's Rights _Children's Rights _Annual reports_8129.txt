Eric Thompson 3Protecting Kids. Providing Hope. 
Getting Results.
2020 was traumatic for all of us, but especially for children. The pandemic took an enormous 
toll as families were forced to navigate what the crisis means for their psychological and 
emotional health, educations and futures. The impact was even more severe among children 
in government systems, and amplified the struggles they already faced. But thanks to the 
support of our donors and partners, Children’s Rights was able to rapidly respond to the 
impact of COVID and, through strategic advocacy and legal action, continue to work to keep 
kids safe and healthy.
Children’s Rights is pleased to share key highlights from our year:
• Within weeks of the advent of COVID-19, Children’s Rights partnered with other 
advocates and government officials to draft recommendations to protect older youth. 
States adopted our guidelines  to make extended foster care services available for older 
youth at risk of homelessness and hunger and to support older foster youth and to put a 
moratorium on youth aging out.
• After we learned of the growing number of positive COVID-19 cases in group settings, 
Children’s Rights spearheaded a national movement calling for policy change to remove 
youth from crowded, dangerous facilities and place them in family settings .
• Children’s Rights continued to expose the egregious treatment of youth in group homes 
and facilities , and to advocate for children to be removed from facilities and placed with 
their families or in family settings. 
• In Iowa, a federal judge ordered sweeping reforms, banishing the use of a cruel 
restraining device and solitary confinement  for students housed in the Boys State 
Training School. Because of this victory, the school administrators must provide 
appropriate mental health services to youth in state custody. 
• We shared a new resource  highlighting how the discrimination, institutionalization, and 
abuse that LGBTQ+ youth already face is exacerbated by COVID-19. The report lifts up 
the voices of youth and offers solutions to protect them.
• In Georgia, Children’s Rights continued its legal fight for the right of every child to 
receive an education. Officials granted preliminary approval to provide special education 
services for hundreds of incarcerated youth in one of the largest county jail system in the 
U.S.
• We filed an urgent new case in Ohio calling on the state to provide equal financial 
support to the 4,500 children —24% whom are Black children—living with relative foster 
parents.
• Through education and advocacy, our Interfaith Coalition for Children’s Rights  raised 
awareness for a wave of government policies that use religious freedom to enshrine a 
“license to discriminate,” harming LGBTQ+ children and families. 
• We filed an amicus brief  in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia on behalf of the children who 
would be harmed if the Supreme Court upheld the position that a local government-
contracted foster care agency has a constitutional right to refuse prospective families 
based solely on religious objections. 
• In recognition for our groundbreaking victory in Missouri to end the common practice of 
administering powerful psychotropic medications to kids as young as 5 or 6, Children’s 
Rights received the Impact Fund’s 2020 Hero Award.  
• We continued to monitor the implementation of reforms in five states: South Carolina, 
Connecticut, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Texas .
Children’s Rights fights for systemic change in child welfare. And we win. Donor support 
ensures that we can keep on winning for generations to come.FALL 20214
