Some ofthese prisoners have spent most of the past thirteen years in isolation.The rest have been in isolation for monthsand in many cases for more than a year.With rare exceptions, even their brief daily "outside" period and visitsto the shower take place away from other inmates.Other than prison authorities, their onlydirect human contact occurs during brief family visits. Even then, they do notsee other prisoners or the relatives of other prisoners, but only the guardswho are stationed nearby, often taking notes as they speak.According to their relatives,these prisoners have not been told formally why they are in isolation or howand when the prison administration reviews these decisions.The arbitrariness and open-ended nature ofthe isolation compounds the suffering felt by the prisoners and their families.Other prisoners are held insmall-group isolation.Thispractice involves confining prisoners to a cell with a small number ofcell-mates, all of whom are prevented from seeing other inmates or accessingprison facilities and activities available to the general prison population.In 1991, Tunisia's interior ministerpublicly ordered that all security service members comply fully with the U.N.Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.Yet Tunisia's isolated prisoners aresubjected to conditions that clearly violate these principles.Many do not receive the minimum one-hourperiod daily outside their cells for exercise. Many live in cells that lack awindow providing natural light and a flow of air.The Standard Minimum Rules emphasize thatprisoners should have regular access to meaningful activities, yet inmates insolitary confinement cannot participate in the vocational and educationalprograms offered by the prison, and have very limited access to readingmaterials.Prison systems around the worldhave legitimate reasons to isolate certain persons in their custody.But Tunisia's prolonged isolation ofselected inmates, most of them leaders of the banned Nahdha party, seems drivenless by legitimate penological motives than by a political will to punish anddemoralize these individuals, and to crush the Islamist trend theyrepresent.Tunisia cannot claim to berespecting international human rights standards so long as it maintains such aregime of prolonged isolation of prisoners.RecommendationsHuman Rights Watch reaffirms itscall for the release of all prisoners in Tunisia who were convicted for actsof expression, association, and assembly that have no link to violence orrecognizable criminal activity.For allother prisoners who were convicted of politically motivated acts in proceedingsthat did not confirm to international standards for a fair trial, we urge an amnestyor their release from prison pending new and fair trials.Human Rights Watch urges Tunisianprison authorities to improve the living conditions and treatment of allpersons in custody so as to comply with all relevant international norms,including those spelled out in the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for theTreatment of Prisoners.[1]In particular, we urge animmediate end to the prolonged isolation of political prisoners as it iscurrently practiced.No inmate should beplaced in isolation except as a last resort.When isolation is deemed to be warranted, there should be a presumptionin favor of placing affected prisoners in cells or wings with one another,rather than in solitary confinement.In accordance with internationalnorms, solitary confinement should be imposed only for relatively short periodsof time, in an individualized fashion, under strict supervision, including by aphysician and only for legitimate penological reasons of discipline orpreventive security. When used "preventively," isolation should not be imposedto stop prisoners from exchanging political views and information, but onlywhen an individual's behavior has shown him or her to be so chronically violentor dangerous as to pose a demonstrable and serious threat to prison safety andsecurity.Tunisian authorities should makepublic the criteria governing the placement of inmates in isolation and allregulations pertaining to its practice.Inmates placed in isolation, whether for punitive or preventive reasons,should be given a detailed, individualized explanation of the specific reasonsin writing and have a meaningful opportunity to challenge the order at regularintervals.Senior corrections officialsshould periodically review the justification for isolating each inmate, andtheir decisions should in turn be reviewed by an impartial, independentauthority.Tunisian authorities should ensure that conditions faced by prisonersplaced in isolation preventively areno more restrictive thannecessary for legitimate security considerations.Policies should permit and encourageprisoners to maintain constructive lives and should acknowledge their inherentdignity and value as human beings.Whenprison authorities isolate a prisoner for preventive reasons, they should findways to enhance conditions for that prisoner in order to compensate for thehardship of the added restrictions on his movement and human contacts.Tunisian authorities should honortheir own pledge to abide by all parts of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules,including by ensuring that all inmates:reside in cells that have a window providing natural light and fresh air;are allowedat least one hour daily outside their cell in a space that is large enoughto allow for vigorous physical activity;have accessto meaningful activities and a broad variety of reading materials; andmay send andreceive mail without arbitrary interference and delays.Human Rights Watch alsorecommends that Tunisian authorities open its prisons, including isolationunits, to independent and qualified domestic and international monitoringorganizations, a step that was hinted at by Minister of Justice and HumanRights Bchir Tekkari on April 20.Authorities should allow such visits to be unimpeded, unannounced andoccurring at frequent intervals.Tunisia should become a party tothe Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. The Protocol allowsindependent international experts to conduct regular visits to places ofdetention within the territory of states parties, to assess the conditions ofdetention and make recommendations for improvements.We urge the European Union, theArab League, United States, Canada, and all countries having bilateralrelations with Tunisia to monitor prison conditions; to encourage access forindependent monitoring procedures as noted above; and to press Tunisianauthorities, through private and public channels, to bring their prisons intocompliance with international norms, including by ending the arbitrary andunjustified use of solitary confinement for political prisoners.We urge the U.N. Working Group onArbitrary Detention to turn its attention to the plight of political prisonersin prolonged isolation in Tunisia,and to request from Tunisian authorities access to prisoners in isolation.About this ReportAs of March 10, 2004, theInternational Association of Solidarity with Political Prisoners (AssociationInternationale pour le soutien des prisonniers politiques, AISPP) said it hadconfirmed forty cases of political prisoners currently in isolation, but cautionedthat the number could be higher.Gettingcurrent accurate statistics is difficult because officials do not give outnumbers and prisoners are moved in and out of isolation without their familiesnecessarily being notified.No independent human rightsorganization has received authorization to inspect prisons since 1991, when theTunisian Human Rights League was able to conduct a perfunctory visit. When theissue of access has been raised, authorities pointed out that prisons arevisited on an unannounced basis by the Higher Committee of Human Rights andFundamental Liberties.But thatcommittee, a state-appointed body established in 1991, reports its findingsprivately to the President and does not make them public.[2]On July 8, 2003, Human Rights Watch sent a letterto Minister of Justice and Human Rights Tekkari stating our intention toconduct research for a report on prison conditions and requesting permission tovisit prisons.No reply oracknowledgement of that letter was received.Human Rights Watch sent another letter on April 13, 2004, via the Tunisian Embassy in Washington, DC,requesting information on policies on the solitary confinement ofprisoners.As of June 10, 2004 no answer had beenreceivedIn August 2003, Human RightsWatch consultant Alain Werner traveled to Tunisia to interview formerpolitical prisoners about the conditions of their confinement.He collected information from ex-prisoners,lawyers, and the families of current prisoners. While the consultant was ableto move about the country freely, a former political prisoner who assisted him,Abdullah Zouari, was arrested on August 17, 2003, one week after the consultant departed,on trumped-up charges and sentenced to nine months in prison.[3]Zouari is serving this and another four-monthsentence on earlier charges and is due to be released in September 2004.This report is based on thatresearch mission and on phone interviews conducted in March and April 2004 withthe relatives of ten prisoners who are currently being held in isolation. Theisolated prisoners themselves could not realistically be contacted: they havefew means to communicate with the outside world, and their family visits areshort and monitored by prison guards.They are not permitted to have or use telephones. Letters are subject tocensorship and often do not reach their destination.Prisoners who do talk about their conditionsmay refrain from telling the worst, in order to avoid retaliation by prisonstaff or to spare their relatives additional distress.The accounts we collected fromprisoners' families were consistent, despite some variations in the treatmentof the prisoners depending on the period and the prison in which they wereheld.Family members knew in varyinglevel of detail the conditions of their relatives.Not all of them knew, for example, thequality of lighting in the isolation cells or how frequently inmates wereallowed to shower. The interviewees agreed to the publication of their names andof the information they provided.Human Rights Watch gratefullyacknowledges the research conducted by consultant Alain Werner and theadditional research conducted by intern Marie Yared.We also thank the former prisoners andrelatives of current prisoners who agreed to speak with us, as well as theAISPP in Tunis and independent human rightsactivist Luiza Toscane in Parisfor information they shared.This report was written by EricGoldstein, research director of the Middle East and NorthAfrica division of Human Rights Watch.It was edited by Joe Stork, deputy directorof that division, Dinah Pokempner, general counsel of Human Rights Watch, andWidney Brown, deputy program director of Human Rights Watch. Mohamed AbdelDayem, associate with the Middle East and North Africadivision, prepared the report for publication.IntroductionTunisia is a middle-incomecountry.It enjoys the highest grossnational product per capita after Lebanon among non-oil-exportingArab states.Despite Tunisia's relative prosperity, itsprisons remain well below international norms, with persistent overcrowding,poor hygiene, frequent reports of medical neglect, and abusive use of solitaryconfinement.The treatment of politicalprisoners, virtually all of them actual or suspected members of the Nahdha partyor other banned Islamist movements, has been especiallyand deliberatelysevere.Faced with domestic andinternational criticism on prison conditions and repeated hunger strikes byprisoners,[4] thegovernment of Tunisiahas over the past five years pursued a number of initiatives, constructionprojects, and legal reforms that brought modest improvements in the treatmentof inmates.Most recently, Minister ofJustice and Human Rights Bchir Tekkari declared in a press conference on April20, "We have no objections to having organizations known for their independenceand impartiality visit any prison in the country."He named the International Committee of theRed Cross (ICRC) and the Red Crescent as organizations that met this criterionbut ruled out Amnesty International and the Tunisian Human Rights League (LigueTunisienne des droits de l'Homme, LTDH).[5]Allowing access to the ICRC wouldbe a breakthrough, even though that organization does not ordinarily publicizeits findings but rather reports them privately to the governmentconcerned.No nongovernmental humanrights or humanitarian organization, national or international, has beenallowed to inspect Tunisian prisons since a perfunctory visit by the LTDH in1991.[6]The ICRC, contacted by Human Rights Watch onJune 14, said it presently had no agreement with Tunisian authorities to beginconducting such visits, although discussions between the two parties had takenplace.If Tunisian authorities do openprison doors to independent monitoring groups, the inmates in prolongedisolation should be among the visitors' highest priorities.Whatever the justification for isolatingthese prisoners may besomething Tunisian authorities have never explainedpublicly, to our knowledgethe actual conditions that the inmates experiencein long-term solitary confinementthe absence of normal social interaction,of reasonable mental stimulus, and exposure to the natural worldispotentially harmful to their mental health. It is also a violation of theprohibition against cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and,in some cases, may rise to the level of torture.The physical isolation of theseprisoners routinely co-exists with other restrictions on their links to theoutside world: for example, letters are censored and sometimes arrive monthslate, if at all; and the prisoners are often refused permission to receivebooks and journals widely available in Tunisia. Access to writingmaterials is often restricted, and phone calls are not permitted.Prisoners have no access to vocational oreducational programs available at the facility.The prolonged and severe natureof solitary confinement for this group of inmates, most of them leaders of thebanned Nahdha party, seems driven less by legitimate penological concerns thanby a political will to punish and demoralize them, and crush the Islamist trendthey represent.Government officials have statedrepeatedly over the years that the country holds no political prisoners or"prisoners of opinion," only criminals tried and convicted for violatingTunisian law.Human Rights Watchdisputes this characterization on two grounds. The Nahdha party has not beenlinked to acts of violence for over a decade.Nearly all of those who are serving time for Nahdha-related activitywere convicted of charges that lack any link to violence, such as membership inan "unrecognized" organization, or collecting funds, attending meetings, orperforming unspecified activities on behalf of an "unrecognized" organization.[7]Second, most of these defendants and thoseconvicted of graver charges did not benefit from the right to a fairtrial.In the most prominent example,nearly one hundred of today's prisoners were among the 265 Nahdha followersconvicted in a mass military court trial of plotting to overthrow thegovernment.The defendants denied theexistence of such a plot, claiming their confessions were extracted throughtorture.Human rights organizations thatmonitored the trial denounced it as unfair.[8]The verdicts in that case were notsubject to appeal and were all confirmed by the Court of Cassation.Forty-six of the defendants received lifeterms, although many of these were later commuted to thirty years in prison.The mass arrests and trials of 19911992effectively smashed the Nahdha movement.With virtually all of its senior cadres either in prison or in exile,the movement has had a low profile inside Tunisia since then.Nevertheless, suspected sympathizers of theNahdha party and other smaller, lesser-known Islamist groups continue to bearrested and charged. Scores of suspected Islamists have been sentenced inunfair trials before criminal courts to long prison terms for belonging to a"bandfounded in order to prepare or carry out attacks against persons orproperty" (Article 131 of the Penal Code). Others were tried in militarycourts, even though they were civilians, because they were charged with"terror" offenses found in the code of military justice.[9]They cannot appeal their convictions by themilitary courts.The arrests and trials havecontinued despite the fact that Tunisiahas been largely free of political violence.Since 1991, the only fatal attack attributed to Islamists was the April2002 truck bomb that targeted a synagogue in Djerba, killing twenty-one.The suicide bomber was Tunisian.Al-Qaida claimed responsibility for theattack.The persons in long-termisolation are mostly political leaders of the Nahdha movement who were triedand convicted in the 1992 mass trial mentioned above.While plotting to overthrow the government isof course a grave charge, it does not by itself provide a penologicaljustification for placing these prisoners in solitary confinement.Putting aside for a moment the evidence thattheir trial was grossly unfair and the charges against them were not proven, itis worth noting that these individuals were never convicted of committing actsof violence.And even if they had beenconvicted in a fair trial of grave offenses, this would not justify theirplacement in solitary confinement for preventive or punitive reasons.In fact, long-term solitaryconfinement is not a legal punishment for prisoners in Tunisia, since the law regulatingprisons limits solitary confinement as apunishment to a period of ten days, and forbids any forms of punishment notlisted in the law.[10]Prison administrations may have preventivereasons for segregating inmates; for example, for their own protection, or ifthey have a history of attempted escapes, or for violent or disruptive behaviordirected toward other inmates or prison staff.But these sorts of preventive arguments have to our knowledge never beenmade explicitly by Tunisian authorities to justify their long-term isolation ofpolitical prisoners.(Prison administrationsmay also place inmates in isolation to address a public health threat.)Some ex-prisoners and familymembers said that those in isolation were told informally, or led tounderstand, that they were segregated to keep them from influencing or incitingthe other prisoners.This objective isalso reputed to be the motive behind the frequent transfer of politicalprisoners from prison to prison around the country, a practice that imposeshardship on families who must travel hundreds of kilometers in order to seetheir relative for fifteen- or twenty-minute sessions.Prison authorities have alegitimate interest in stopping inmates from inciting disturbances. However, ifthat is the basis for isolating prisoners in Tunisia, authorities appear to bedoing it on the basis of mere assumption rather on the basis of a reviewable,case-by-case determination that an individual is engaged in committing orinciting disturbances while in prison.Furthermore, if their motive isto prevent incitement, they must target only speech and planning that mightcontribute directly to disturbances at the prison facility, and not penalize orsegregate prisoners for exchanging views or information of a political nature.The families and ex-prisoners weinterviewed said they knew of no prisoners currently in long-term isolation towhom authorities had provided a formal explanation for this treatment.Nor were they formally notified of atimetable or procedures for reviewing or terminating their term inisolation.The arbitrariness andopen-ended nature of the isolation policy compounds the cruelty inflicted oninmates cut off from virtually all human contact.Prison Conditions: Gradual ImprovementsMany former prisoners who servedtime in the early and mid-1990s - during and following the crackdown on theNahdha party - described treatment that clearly amounted to torture, includingroutine beatings by prison guards and even by senior staff and prison wardens,and the shackling of some prisoners hand and foot much of the day.Prisoners with health problems were oftendenied medication or proper care, and infestations and skin diseases wererampant due to poor hygienic conditions. Inmates were subject to extremes ofweather without adequate clothing and bedding.Hygiene was substandard and overcrowding so severe that cellmates had nochoice but to sleep in shifts.Onfamily-visit days, guards routinely humiliated and mistreated the inmates'relatives.Isolation regimes were harsherthan they are now. Whereas today, prison administrations generally respect therights of prisoners in solitary confinement to take daily walks outside theircells and to receive family visits weekly, this was not always the case.Abdullah Zouari wrote of hisexperience in 1995 when he was transferred to Rejim Ma'toug prison in thesouthern desert:I was placed in isolation forfive months, during which time I saw no one other than my guard.He let me out of my cell only five minutes inthe morning and five minutes in the evening.It was barely enough to perform the necessities, wash my clothes anddishes, and provide myself with water. When they escorted me to the showers,they would cover my eyesto prevent me from seeing anything.In 1998, at Houareb PrisonIwas placed in a solitary confinement cell below the guards' sleepingquarters.Dirty water dripped steadilyfrom above.I stayed there for threemonths without once going out on a daily walk.[11]Another prisoner, Ridha Boukadi, wrote:In 1996, I was in the 9th ofApril Prison in Tunis,in the isolation wing, located above the infirmary.Our outside walk never lasted more than sevenminutes.The total isolation ofprisoners was one of the many arbitrary measures they used. Once the prisonerwas placed in his cell, he was completely cut off from his surroundings. He hadno relation with anyone other than the guard assigned to watching him.Even other guards didn't have the right tointeract with him.[12]Abdelwahab Sdiri, the pseudonym of a still-incarcerated prisoner whomanaged to smuggle out an account of his experiences, described a particularlyharsh form of small group isolation practiced in the mid-1990s and known toprisoners as the siloun(apparentlya slang term derived from cellule,the French word for "cell"):[In] the siloun, which is a dark, tiny cell with no ventilation orfacilities, the prisoner, even if he is young, gets sick, because the silounis suffocating in summer and freezing in winter. There is no toilet. Plastic orglass bottles serve as urinals.The silounis equipped with medieval chains.If theprisoner is punished by being handcuffed, he must satisfy his needs in aplastic pot and his cellmates must cover it.The prisoner is held naked or given a prisoner's uniform made of thickcotton, dirty, and full of lice, which gives you scabies or allergies.The blankets are dirty, foul, and full oflice and bugs.The administration cansend a prisoner to the siloun aspunishment for as long as a month, and can extend the period as itpleases.When a prisoner is put in theindividual or group siloun, he is always also forbidden to receivevisits by his family or food packages from them, and forbidden to makepurchases at the prison canteen.[13]The mistreatment of prisonersgenerally began to ease in late 1996, according to numerous people who wereincarcerated at the time. Taoufik Kabaoui, who served from December 1990 untilJuly 2003, said that in 1996-1997 political prisoners begin to be permitted toeat and pray in groups, to have copies of the Quran, and had more opportunitiesto communicate with other prisoners.[14]Samir Dilou, who was released in 2001 afterserving ten years, said that in October 1997 political prisoners in the 9thof April Prison in Tuniswon permission to pray in the courtyard of the prison, a victory that wasperceived by inmates as "a fundamental change."[15]Human rights lawyer Nejib Hosni, who was imprisoned from 1994 to 1996 and againin 2000-2001, noted a change between the first and second periods.During his earlier term there was pressure onthe guards to abuse the political prisoners physically, whereas such abuse wasno longer systematic in the later term. The conditions of family visits alsoimproved, he said.[16]Despite a reduction in someabuses, still-harsh prison conditions continued to attract criticisminternationally, fueled by credible first-hand accounts provided by imprisonedhuman rights activists Nejib Hosni, Khemas Chammari (imprisoned in 1996), andKhemas Ksila (imprisoned 19971999).[17]The government responded with aseries of legal reforms. A 2000 law amended the Penal Procedure Code (Code deprocdure penale, CPP) to make the judges with competence over implementationof prison sentences (juges d'excutiondes peines) responsible for ensuring that prison conditions complied withthe law.These judges, who are attachedto the trial courts, must visit the prison or prisons under their jurisdictionat least once every two months to study the conditions of detention ofconvicted prisoners.The prison administrationand doctor report to the judge, who submits annual reports to the Ministry ofJustice containing observations, conclusions, and recommendations.[18]In January 2001, administrationof prisons was transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry ofJustice and Human Rights.In April ofthat year, parliament adopted the prison reform law mentioned above that, amongother things, required the separation of pre-trial and convicted prisoners andrestricted the use of force by guards.In December 2002, President Zineal-Abidine Ben Ali ordered an inquiry into prison conditions, to be headed bythe president of the governmental Higher Committee of Human Rights andFundamental Liberties, Zakaria Ben Moustafa. (Ben Moustafa, a former minister andex-mayor of Tunis,had been commissioned in 1995 by President Ben Ali to conduct a prison inquiry.At that time, when conditions were arguably close to their worst, Ben Moustafaannounced that they met international norms and that abuses were "very rare andisolated."[19])The findings of the Higher Committee'sinquiry were never made public, but press reports in February 2003 indicatedthat after receiving them, President Ben Ali ordered a number of reforms.These measures included physical improvementsand new equipment to ease overcrowding and improve hygiene and healthcare.[20]In March 2003, Minister of Justice and HumanRights Tekkari announced the creation of an office in his ministry to monitorthe conditions of detainees and prisoners, the daily As-Sabah reported on March 9 of that year.Pressures on Organizations and Journalists Reportingon Prison ConditionsWhile the government granted theHigher Committee access to prisons and prisoners in order to conduct itsinquiries, it denied access to independent human rights organizations access toprisons and also subjected these groups and their leaders to variousrestrictions and forms of harassment.Until very recently, it had refused to accept the application for legalrecognition of the Tunis-based International Association of Solidarity withPolitical Prisoners (Association Internationale pour le soutien desprisonniers politiques, AISPP), first submitted in November 2002.Finally, on March 29, 2004, authorities accepted the AISPP'sapplication for legal recognition, seventeen months after it was firstsubmitted.According to the Law onAssociations, the minister of interior has ninety days from the date ofaccepting the application to reject it, in which case he must state hisreasons. In the absence of such a rejection, the AISPP can begin to operatelegally as soon as the Journal Officielde la Rpublique Tunisienne publishes a notice of its formation.The government continued torefuse legal recognition to another organization active on prisoner rights, theNational Council on Liberties in Tunisia (Conseil National pour lesLiberts en Tunisie, CNLT).[21]The AISPP and CNLT continuedtheir work even without legal status, despite the risks and obstacles thisposed. The Law on Associations provides for prison terms and a fine for personswho organize or conduct activities on behalf of an "unrecognized"organization.On several occasions,members of the AISPP and the CNLT have been assaulted in public places by menin plainclothes believed to be police.[22]On Saturday, January 3, 2004,police in Tunisblocked efforts by the AISPP to hold a congress. AISPP president andex-political prisoner Mohamed Nouri continues to be prevented from travelingabroad on the grounds that he is subject to a criminal investigation fordisseminating false information.Nouriwas turned back at Tunis-Carthage airport on December 9, 2003, and February 10, 2004, when attempting toparticipate in human rights meetings in Europe.Human rights defenders often find that they have been placed under judicialinvestigation on dubious charges; the case is neither tried nor dismissed butbecomes the pretext for banning their foreign travel.The Tunisian League for HumanRights, which monitors prison conditions along with other issues, continues toface legal pressures.In 2001, aTunisian court nullified the recent internal elections that had given the LTDHan independent and outspoken leadership.The court's ruling against the LTDH came in response to astate-encouraged lawsuit filed by four dissident members.An appeals court upheld the decision but saidthe current leadership could remain in office solely for the purpose oforganizing new elections. The LTDH's leadership rejected the ruling aspolitical in nature and has continued its activism despite the court orderlimiting its scope of operations.[23]That court order hangs over theLeague as it defiantly pursues its work. The order was also invoked by MinisterTekkari at his April 20 press conference to justify excluding the LTDH frompossible prison visits. An organization must first of all be functioninglegally before applying for access, he said.[24]An earlier attempt at forming anindependent organization focused on political prisoners, the National Committeefor the Defense of Prisoners of Conscience, resulted in the arrest ofco-founder Salah Hamzaoui on charges of defamation, disseminating falseinformation liable to disturb the public order, and forming an organizationwithout following the procedures laid out by the Law on Associations. Hamzaouispent ten days in detention in February 1993 for his role in forming thecommittee.In another clampdown on effortsto expose prison conditions, Hdi Yahmed, the author of a 2002 investigativearticle, was summoned for questioning by state prosecutors and pressured toquit the journal he worked for.Theexpos of conditions in the 9th of AprilPrison in Tunis, published in Haqa'iq/Ralits weekly, was uncharacteristically critical for aTunisian publication.[25]For example, it pointed out that while the2001 prison law guaranteed each inmate an individual bed (Article 15), ahierarchy prevailed among prisoners in group cells by which the new arrivalsfirst slept on the floor, then under a bed where they were jostled less, thenin a shared bed, before eventually getting a bed of their own.Yahmed's article appeared in theissue dated December 12,2002. On December 14, the prosecutor's office summoned Yahmed and Haqa'iq/Ralits's general manager forquestioning on the article.According toYahmed, the editors then informed him that he could no longer work for themagazine.[26]Haqa'iq/Ralits disputed Yahmed'sversion, claiming he quit voluntarily, ignoring pleas from his colleagues toremain.[27]Curiously, the editor's note providing the magazine's version of the affair ison its website but Yahmed's investigative article, which triggered thecontroversy, is not.Prisoners in Isolation: Ten CasesThe following section describesthe plight of ten inmates in four prisons, nine of whom are in solitaryconfinement and one in small-group isolation.Their treatment is sufficiently standardized to suggest that overallpolicy on prolonged isolation is set at a level higher than that of individualprison directors.Among those facing the strictestand most relentless isolation regimes are leaders of the Nahdha movement.Some of them have known at best only briefrespites from solitary confinement since their arrests in 1990 and 1991.Ali Laaridhis aformer Nahdha spokespersonand a father of three.He has been insolitary confinement for fourteen years, except for two brief respites,according to his brother, Amer, who lives in Parisand is in regular communication with Ali's family in Tunisia.[28]These respites occurred when he spent about ten days in a group cell in 1992,around the time of his trial, and once again for a little over two months inthe summer of 2002.Now in the 9th ofApril Prison in Tunis,Ali lives in a small cell that has no window, only an opening in the door.According to his brother, Ali has no humancontact except for his weekly family visit on Fridays. He eats in his cell andhas no access to the prison library or gymnasium. The guards do not speak withhim. When he is taken for a shower or for his daily exercise, the prison staffempties these areas so that Ali encounters no other prisoners. The same is truefor his weekly walk to the hall where family visits take place.At the family visit, two grills,about one meter apart, separate Ali from his relatives.There are always at least four guardspresent, two on the family side and two on the prison side, or in the spacebetween the two sides.The visits neverlast more than ten or fifteen minutes, Amer said.Ali is generally permitted to receive foodfrom his relatives during these visits, with certain restrictions.According to his brother, Ali hasno access to television or newspapers.His family informed him of the U.S.-led war on Iraq two weeks after it had begun,Amer said. Two or three times a year he is permitted to borrow a book from theprison library, but the volumes are old and the choices limited. Even hisaccess to pens, paper, and notebooks is restricted.The administration gives him a single sheetof paper each week.Ali can receivemail, but not consistently.When Amertried to mail him money orders, he said, they were returned to him, as if hisbrother did not exist. Amer kept the postal receipts as documentation.Hamadi Jebali edited theNahdha newspaper al-Fajr at the time of his arrest in 1990. He initiallywas given a one-year sentence for "defaming a judicial institution" bypublishing an article by lawyer Mohamed Nouri entitled, "When Will MilitaryCourts, Serving as Special Courts, Be Abolished?" While behind bars for this"offense," Hamadi was charged in the mass trial of Nahdha leaders accused ofplotting to overthrow the state.He wasgiven a fifteen-year sentence in that case.[29]Jebali's wife Wahida Trabelsicannot visit him weekly because of the 120-kilometer distance between her homein the city of Sousseand Sfax prison, where he is currently held. Wahida told Human Rights Watchthat Hamadi shared a cell with other prisoners for the first three years of hissentence but has been in isolation for ten years since then.[30]His cell has a sink and a toilet; she is notsure if there is a window.Hamadi has atelevision that receives the official Canal Tunis,but not the other channels widely available in Tunisia.He can receive newspapers, but only thosethat are pro-government.He is allowedto have a copy of the Quran but cannot visit the library.Hamadi could send and receivemail regularly before he went on a hunger strike in early 2003.Since then, correspondence takes two to threemonths to arrive, Wahida said.Theprison administration opens and reads correspondence to and from Hamadi, sheadded.Like Ali Laaridh and the otherprisoners in isolation, Hamadi eats all meals in his cell.Whereas showers are a communal affair forordinary prisoners, Hamadi and the other prisoners in solitary confinement usethe shower facilities alone. His daily walk "doesn't last longer than fifteenminutes and takes place in a tiny courtyard open to the sky, with no otherprisoners present," said Wahida. When Wahida visits her husband,Everything stops.All the doors are closed and neither myhusband nor I see any other prisoners.There are always at least four guards present, one at least behind meand three behind Hamadi.There is agrill between us and we are more than one meter apart.In principle, the visit is supposed to lastfifteen minutes but the guards can cut it short if they do not approve of ourconversation.So what we talk about islimited to "I'm fine," "Everything's OK," that sort of thing.Karim Harouni was, likeHamadi Jebali and Ali Laaridh, convicted in the mass trials of Islamists in1992 and has spent the last thirteen years being moved from prison toprison.He has served time at theprisons of Bizerte, Mehdia, Messadine, SidiBouzid, Monastir, Houareb, and is now at the prison of Sfax, located some 270kilometers from his family's home near Tunis.Former secretary general of theIslamist-leaning General Union of Tunisian Students (l'Union Gnrale Tunisienne des Etudiants, U.G.T.E.), Harounireceived a life sentence from the military court.In 2002 this was reduced to a thirty-yearsentence.Since arriving at Sfax prison on April 18, 2003, Harouni hasbeen kept in strict solitary confinement, his sister, Hend Harouni, told HumanRights Watch.[31]He is locked in his room more thantwenty-three hours a day and is kept from seeing his fellow inmates on hisdaily walk and during his family visits. His room has a small window that doesnot open.Harouni's family now comes onlyonce a month, owing to the time and expense of the journey.Visitors to Sfax prison are separated fromtheir relatives by a plate of glass and must speak through telephones.Letters, says Karim's father Amor Harouni,take an average of two weeks en routewhen they arrive at all.[32]Hend estimates that her brotherhas spent four-fifths of the last thirteen years in isolation, including fiveyears in "small-group isolation" at Houareb Prison, in the city of Kairouan, where he shareda cell with two other inmates but was not allowed to mix with the rest of theprison population.When he was transferred fromHouareb to Sfax prison in April 2003, his family was not informed and traveledto Houareb for their regular visit only to learn he had been moved.Then, when his family learned that Karim'sbelongings had been left behind at Houareb, they had to make follow-up calls tothe prison administration of Houareb to get them forwarded.At one point they were advised to pick uphis belongings themselves at Houareb and deliver them to Sfax.(Kairouan and Sfax are more than 100kilometers apart.) Eventually the prison authority forwarded his belongings.According to Hend, Karim's simplerequests to the prison authorities are either refused or require protractedfollow-ups before they are granted.Karim had lobbied for years to obtain a copy of Liberation and Enlightenment: Interpretations of the Quran (Tafsir at-Tahrir wa-t-Tanwir), bythe renowned theologian Tahar Ben Achour (1879-1973), which is widely availableat bookstores in Tunisia.His father sent numerous registered lettersto officials to relay his son's request for the book.Finally, according to his father, the director of Houareb prison authorized entryof the book, which his family had purchased for him, but only one section of itat a time, subject to Karim returning the earlier part.But before he could finish reading the firstpart of the book, the administration took it back.Karim was then transferred to Sfax prison,where the volume sat with the administration until, after more lobbying by himand his family, Karim was once again allowed to have it. He is allowed also tohave the Quran, which is not the case for some of the other prisoners inisolation, Hend said.Karim went on hunger strike on November 18, 2003, todemand an end to solitary confinement and to demand other improvements.His demands went largely unmet before hehalted his strike on January8, 2004. However, Harouni and some other co-strikers gottelevisions put into their cells.According to Hend, it receives only one channel, state television'sCanal 7, but not the widely available Canal 21 or the Italian Rai Uno.Harouni is also allowed to receive the dailypro-government newspaper, Le Temps.Harouni and other Nahdha leadersat Sfax prison asked to be allowed to pray together during the Muslimholidays.This request was refused.Hend said it was hard for Karimto tell the family in detail about the conditions in his cell or his day-to-daylife because guards listen in on their brief visits with him.She said that to the best of her knowledge,her brother was never told why he must remain in solitary confinement or why hehas been tranferred from prison to prison.Bouraoui Makhlouf joined thehunger strike at Borj al-'Amri prison on December 15, 2003.He had arrived in that prison, located about30 kilometers west of Tunis,only one month before.Prior to that,Bouraoui had served time in Houareb, Monastir, Mehdia,Tunis, Bizerte,and Grombalia prisons.He was sentencedin the mass trials of 1992 to a life term, later reduced to thirty years.Bouraoui's wife, Souheila BenMoustapha, says that since his transfer she can visit him only every other weekbecause the journey from her home in Sousseis too long and expensive to make weekly.[33]According to Souheila, herhusband's solitary cell in Borj al-'Amri has no window.The only opening is in the door and iscovered by iron bars.The cell has abed, table, and toilet. Bouraoui spent forty-seven days on hunger strike todemand an end to solitary confinement, more time outside the cell, and atelevision set.Authorities agreed toinstall a television in his cell.Souheila said that her husband'sdaily walk outside his cell lasts only fifteen minutes, during which he seesand talks to no one.He told her thatthe longest walk he gets occurs when he is escorted to the room where hereceives his visitorsagain, with guards listening in but no other prisonersor their families in sight.Prior to arriving at Borjal-'Amri and being placed in solitary confinement, Bouraoui spent several yearsin small-group isolation, in a small cell with two or three other prisoners butcut off from the rest of the prison population.Before that, said his wife, he was in a larger cell with other prisoners.Sahbi Attig, anotherNahdha leader incarcerated in Borj al-'Amri, lives in conditions similar tothose of Bouraoui Makhlouf.His wife,Zeinab Mraihi, said his solitary cell is two meters by two and-a-half meters insize.[34]There is no window but the door has agrill-covered opening 30 centimeters by 30 centimeters.Sahbi gets forty-five minutes daily outsidehis cell, in a corridor that Zeinab described as two meters wide by ten meterslong.She said he tries during that timeto exercise since his cell is not large enough for vigorous activity.Sahbi participated in the hunger strikelaunched on December 15.At itsconclusion, a television set was installed in his cell.Zeinab said her husband was inisolation in Bizerteprison for a period before his transfer to Borj al-'Amri.She said he lived in group cells prior to thetransfer. Because the smoking of other prisoners bothered him he asked to betransferred to a cell housing political prisoners.The administration placed him in solitary confinementinstead.Zeinab, who lives in Tunis forty kilometersfrom the prison, said the family visits occur "correctly," except that twogrills separate her from her husband, and guards are always present to listenin.The packages of food she brings forher husband every other week are delivered to him.Sahbi is a collegeinstructor.He had written the thesisfor his doctorate when his studies were interrupted by his arrest. The lifesentence he received in 1992 was later reduced to thirty years.Abdelhamid Jelassi,anengineer and Nahdha leader, is currently in solitary confinement in Borjal-'Amri, kept in conditions similar to those of Sahbi Atig and BouraouiMakhlouf.His cell has a bed, chair,table, toilet, andsince the recent hunger strikea television.Abdelhamid sees no other prisoners during hisdaily promenade or on his trips to the shower or to the room for family visits.Since Abdelhamid's arrest inApril 1991 he has spent a number of periods in solitary confinementin the 9thof April Prison in Tunisand Gafsa Prisonas well as periods in group cells.His wife, Mounia Brahim, said that maildelivery stopped during the hunger strike; when the inmates ended their strike,the accumulated letters were delivered.[35]Abdelhamid is serving athirty-year sentence, reduced from a life term. His wife said he is permittedto receive reading materials and the food she brings him.Lotfi Snoussi is also aNahdha leader serving a thirty-year sentence, reduced from a life term. Currentlyin Borj al-'Amri prison, he was placed in solitary confinement on October 25, 2003.He joined the hunger strike soon after hisarrival to protest the conditions of his detention.On May 1, 2004, he went on hunger strike again, along withRidha Sadi (see below) and three other prisoners at Borj el-'Amri, to demandan end to their isolation.Faouzia, his sister, says Lotfiwas never given any justification for being put in isolation.She said the family submitted writtencomplaints about it, via registered mail, to Director of Prisons RidhaBoubaker, but got no response.Lotfi served time since 1991 inthe 9th of April Prison in Tunis,Mehdia Prison and Borj er-Roumi.He wasnot held in isolation most of the time. But in the earlier years, Snoussi wasamong the political prisoners who spent periods with their feet shackled duringthe day, except when being taken out for exercise or to shower.Faouzia said the physical mistreatment ofLotfi has ceased, and family visits take place correctlyalthough guards toldLotfi not to dwell on prison conditions when he talks to his visitingrelatives.[36]Mail is delivered now, although it wasinterrupted for long periods in the past.At one point, Faouzia said, it was halted because one of Lofti'sdaughters had written to him in English.Today, Lotfi's isolation seemsslightly less severe than most.According to Faouzia, he is able to converse with a friend in aneighboring cell, and during his forty-five minute daily period outside thecell he sees other inmates and can hold brief conversations with them.Lotfi is able to buypro-government newspapers regularly.But, says Faouzia, because his room is poorly lit, he must stand next tothe opening in the door in order to get light that is sufficient to read them.Ziad Douletli has been inisolation in the 9th of April Prison in Tunis for three or four months, according tohis daughter, Asma Douletli.[37]Arrested in 1990, Ziad is nearing the end ofthe fifteen-year sentence he received in the mass trial of Nahdha membersconvicted of trying to overthrow the state. He has served time in Sfax, Sousse, Monastir, andEl-Kasserine prisons and has not always been in isolation.Ziad sees no one when he goes outon his daily walk or to have his family visit. He has no access to televisionor newspapers, says Asma.He is allowedbooks, but not the ones that interest him, she said.When he receives his relatives,they are separated by two metal grills, with three or four guards alwayspresent.One is stationed in the spacebetween the two grills, one on the side of the family and one or two next toZiad.The visit lasts about fifteenminutes.Letters between Ziad and hisfamily pass normally, Asma said.Mounir Ghath is insolitary confinement in Borj er-Roumi prison, near Bizerte.He arrived there in 2003 after spending two years in other prisons.Mounir, a father of three, wasarrested in 2001 while on a visit home from Italy, where he had been living fora decade.He is one of the few prisonersin isolation who is not affiliated with the Nahdha party. A military courtsentenced Mounir to eight years in prison in January 2002 on charges ofco-founding an al-Qaida-linked terrorist group operating abroad, Adherents ofthe Islamic Community and the Traditions of the Prophet (Ahl al-Jama'aw'as-Sunnah).The lawyers representing Mounirand his co-defendants at trial claimed that the military court ignoredallegations that testimonies had been obtained under duress, that his arrestdate had been falsified in the records, and that the prosecution had producedno convincing evidence.The Court ofCassation nevertheless confirmed the sentences against Mounir and hisco-defendants in April 2002.At leastone of the co-defendants, Jaber Trabelsi, is also reportedly in solitaryconfinement, serving an eight-year sentence.Mounir's wife, Essia Mejidiri,lives in Kairouan, 225 kilometers from the prison.She said Mounir told her that prison staffexplained he was isolated to keep him from influencing other prisoners. Sheadded that he does not talk much about conditions during the family visitsbecause they last only "five minutes, ten minutes maximum," and are monitoredby guards.[38]Letters do not arrive reliably, shesaid.Mounir has no television in hiscell, she added.Ridha Sadiis in small-group isolation in Borjal-'Amri prison.He shares a cell withtwo other political prisoners that is 3.5 by 2.5 meters in size, with 4 squaremeters of unencumbered space in which to move about, his mother, Aziza Melki,said.[39]Ridha, a Nahdha leader, receiveda life term in the 1992 military court mass trial, later reduced to thirtyyears.Prior to being transferred toBorj al-'Amri last year, he served time in Mehdia Prison and the 9thof April Prison in Tunis, mostly either in solitary confinement or small-groupisolation.Ridha was never given aformal explanation why he was kept in isolation, Aziza said.According to Aziza, Ridha's groupcell contains two bunkbeds, a small window, a sink, toilet and a light that doesnot always work.He went on a hungerstrike May 1, along with Lotfi Snoussi (see above) and three other prisoners atBorj el-'Amri, to demand improved conditions.Ridha received a television set in his room-one of his demands-but thefive continued their hunger strike to demand an end to their isolation.Ridha and his two cellmates have longer periods outsidethan do inmates in solitary confinement, although they too are prevented frommixing with other prisoners.Accordingto his mother, they get outdoor time daily from 10 a.m. to noonand again from 4 to 5 p.m.About once every two outdoor periods, theyare able to engage in sports. The courtyard where they exercise is 5 meters by10 meters, Aziza said. Ridha also has access to the prison library, butcomplains it has few books, and fewer still that are topical.Ridha's family visits only once amonth, owing to the distance from their home in Tinja, near Bizerte, to the prison.The visits at Borj al-'Amri are limited totwenty minutes.Except for the three orfour guards who are always present, Ridha and his relatives see no one duringthe visit. At the 9th of April Prison, says Ridha's sister, thevisits lasted only ten to fifteen minutes.SolitaryConfinement: International Norms and Health ConsequencesThis section examines Tunisia'srecord in light of international human rights treaties and norms applicable tothe placement of prisoners in isolation regimes.By invoking these standards HumanRights Watch is not accepting that the political prisoners whom Tunisiahas placed in isolation belong thereor even for that matter, that theybelong in prison in the first place.Asnoted above, Human Rights Watch calls first and foremost for their release fromprison and, pending that, for their release from isolation except where it canbe shown that a particular individual poses a serious danger to the orderlyfunctioning of the prison, and that less drastic means are unavailable tomitigate that danger.Tunisian authorities claim thatprisoners are well-treated in their country. For example, in response to acomplaint filed by an ex-prisoner before the U.N. Committee on Torture, thegovernment responded (according to the U.N.'s official summary of thearguments) that "prisoners' rights are scrupulously protected in Tunisia,without any discrimination, whatever the status of the prisoner, in a contextof respect for human dignity, in accordance with international standards andTunisian legislation." Authorities maintained that Tunisian regulationsgoverning prison establishments "conform to relevant international standards."[40]In a directive dated December 24, 1991,then-Minister of Interior Abdallah al-Kallel instructed security force membersto comply wholly with all of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatmentof Prisoners, "within the framework of Tunisia's New Era in the realm ofdemocracy and human rights protection."[41]Though not a treaty itself, the Standard Minimum Rules are the most widelyaccepted set of standards governing the treatment of prisoners consistent withhuman rights principles.[42]The placement of politicalprisoners in long-term solitary confinement, and the inhuman conditions oftheir confinement, violate Tunisia'sobligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).They also fall well short ofinternational norms on the treatment of prisoners.Article 10 of the ICCPR states,"All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and withrespect for the inherent dignity of the human person."The conditions of solitary confinement inTunisia, with its enforced, round-the-clock solitude, deprivation ofvocational, educational, and meaningful activities that are often available toother prisoners, the arbitrary restrictions on reading and writing materials,the lockdown in small cells that often lack a window to the outside, and thefailure to provide inmates at least one hour daily outside their cramped cells,all deny the inmate the ability to carry out a minimum range of social,intellectual, manual, and physical activities that are fundamental parts ofhuman life.In the more extreme cases, whereinmates have been in isolation almost without interruption for thirteen yearsand face such restrictions as a near-total ban on paper to write on, thetreatment amounts to "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" asproscribed by Article 7 of the ICCPR. The Committee on Human Rights states inits General Comment 20 on that article (dated March 10, 1992), "prolonged solitary confinementof the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article7."The ICCPR was incorporated intoTunisian law by law no. 68-30 of December 29, 1968.According to Article 32 of theTunisian Constitution, all duly ratified treaties "shall have authority overand above [domestic] laws."Tunisiahas also ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman orDegrading Treatment or Punishment (the Convention against Torture).International norms governing thetreatment of prisoners underscore that solitary confinement, whether imposedfor punitive or preventive reasons, is by nature an extreme measure thatrequires close monitoring to minimize the risks of abuse and of harm to thephysical and mental health of the prisoner.The European Committee for thePrevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) -the expert body associated with the Council of Europe - has noted, "It isgenerally acknowledged that all forms of solitary confinement withoutappropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely, in the long-term, tohave damaging effects resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and socialabilities."[43] It hasreminded European governments:The principle of proportionalitycalls for a balance to be struck between the requirement of the case and theapplication of a solitary confinement-type regime, which is a step that canhave very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinementcan, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment; inany event, all forms of solitary confinement should last for as short a time aspossible.[44]The U.N. Basic Principles for theTreatment of Prisoners[45] statesthat "Efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as apunishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken andencouraged."Tunisian officials have notprovided a justification for confining selected political prisoners inisolation for months and sometimes years.If it is being imposed as a form of punishment, it violates Tunisianlaw, which forbids solitary confinement as a punishment for more than ten-dayperiods. If it is justified as "preventive" rather than punitive in nature, itviolates basic norms surrounding solitary confinement.Those norms require that decisions to imposesolitary confinement be subject to regular and transparent reviews, and thatprisoners confined preventively rather than punitively should actually beaccorded conditions or privileges designed to compensate for the hardship ofisolation.The case for measures to mitigatethe effects of segregation derives from the Standard Minimum Rules, whichstate, as a guiding principle:Imprisonment and othermeasures which result in cutting off an offender from the outside world areafflictive by the very fact of taking from the person the right ofself-determination by depriving him of his liberty. Therefore the prison system shall not, except as incidental tojustifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate thesuffering inherent in such a situation. [Article 57, italics added.]Thus, according to the StandardMinimum Rules, disciplinary rules inside the prison are legitimate when theyassist in the proper functioning of the prison, but not as an extrajudicialform of punishment. Article 27 states, "Discipline shall be maintained withfirmness, but with no more restriction than is necessary for safe custody andwell-ordered community life."The U.N. Basic Principles for theTreatment of Prisoners[46]reiterates this basic point in another way:Except for those limitationsthat are demonstrably necessitated by the fact of incarceration, all prisonersshall retain the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights, and, where the State concerned is a party, theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocolthereto, as well as such other rights as are set out in other United Nationscovenants.Applying these principles toprisoners in isolation regimes, the CPT concludes that the hardship ofisolation entitles them to compensatory amenities or opportunities:Prisoners who present aparticularly high security risk should, within the confines of their detentionunits, enjoy a relatively relaxed regime by way of compensation for theirsevere custodial situation.Inparticular, they should be able to meet their fellow prisoners in the unit andbe granted a good deal of choice about activities.Special efforts should be made to develop agood internal atmosphere within high-security units.The aim should be to build positive relationsbetween staff and prisoners.The existence of asatisfactory programme of activities is just as importantif not more soina high security unit than on [sic] a normal location.It can do much to counter the deleteriouseffects upon a prisoner's personality of living in the bubble-like atmosphereof such a unit.The activities providedshould be as diverse as possible (education, sport, work of vocational value,etc.).[47]In Tunisia, prisoners placed inisolation benefit from no special conditions intended to alleviate the hardshipof being isolated; on the contrary, the restrictions they confront whilesegregated seem often to be both arbitrary and designed to heighten theirisolation from people and information.The Standard Minimum Rules state,in Article 66, that to prepare the prisoner for his release, "all appropriatemeans shall be used, includingeducation, vocational guidance and trainingin accordance with the individual needs of each prisoner" In this spirit,Tunisia's 2001 Prison Law states, in Article 19, that the inmate is entitledto"access to written documents that enable him to pursue, from within theprison, programs of study at educational institutions; instructional, culturaland awareness training provided by the prison administrationcultural andathletic activities supervised by a qualified trained civil servant,accordingto the means that are available; leisure activities consistent with prisonregulations; work that is remunerated, according to the means available."While Tunisia touts its programs torehabilitate inmates and prepare them for their return to life outside,prisoners in isolation are unable to leave their cells to participate inprograms such as these.(As politicalprisoners, they would of course reject the notion that they are in need of anyrehabilitation.)The Standard Minimum Rules state,in Article 40. "Every institution shall have a library for the use of allcategories of prisoners, adequately stocked with both recreational andinstructional books, and prisoners shall be encouraged to make full use of it."For prisoners in solitary confinement, access to the prison library is severelylimited, and requests to obtain books and periodicals from outside are subjectto arbitrary censorship.The cells where they spendtwenty-three or more hours daily do not comport with the Standard MinimumRules.For example, Article 11 states,"In all places where prisoners are required to live or work, the windows shallbe large enough to enable the prisoners to read or work by natural light, andshall be so constructed that they can allow the entrance of fresh air whetheror not there is artificial ventilation."Nor do most prisoners inisolation enjoy the minimum outdoor time stipulated by the Standard MinimumRules. Article 21(1) states, "Every prisoner who is not employed in outdoorwork shall have at least one hour of suitable exercise in the open air daily ifthe weather permits."This one-hourminimum is found also in Tunisia's2001 prison law, in article 19(4).The CPT observed about outdoorexercise:The requirement that prisonersbe allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day is widelyaccepted as a basic safeguard (preferably it should form part of a broaderprogramme of activities.) The CPT wishes to emphasize that all prisoners without exception (including those undergoingcellular confinement as a punishment) should be offered the possibility to takeoutdoor exercise daily. It is also axiomatic that outdoor exercise facilitiesshould be reasonably spacious and whenever possible offer shelter frominclement weather.[48] [boldfacein the original]Our interviews suggest that whileprison administrations give each prisoner in isolation a daily period out ofhis cell, most consistently get less than sixty minutes.The Standard Minimum Rules state,in Article 37, that inmates are to permitted, "under necessary supervision" tocorrespond with their family at "regular" intervals.Yet in practice, mail delivery is oftendelayed for weeks or months, or does not arrive at all.Decisions to place an inmate insolitary confinement should, in light of the gravity of such a decision, betransparent and subject to review and to appeals by the inmate inquestion.The CPT states:It is axiomatic that prisonersshould not be subject to a special security regime any longer than the riskthey present makes necessary.This callsfor regular reviews of placement decisions.Such reviews should always be based on the continuous assessment of theindividual prisoner by staff specially trained to carry out suchassessment.Moreover, prisoners shouldas far as possible be kept fully informed of the reasons for their placementand, if necessary, its renewal; this will inter alia enable them to makeeffective use of avenues for challenging that measure.[49]In Tunisia, none of the prisoners'relatives we interviewed knew of any formal procedure for reviewing decisionson solitary confinement.Many penal experts believe that aregime of extreme social isolation, idleness, and reduced mental stimulationendangers mental and physical health. According to these experts, all prisonersneed stimulation to the brain and senses provided by a range of human contactand some variety of activity and environment.The potential risk to mental health depends on each prisoner's priorpsychological strengths and weaknesses, the extent of the social isolationimposed, the absence of activities and stimulation, and the duration ofconfinement.The European Commission for HumanRights, an organ of the Council of Europe later absorbed into the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights, stated that "the international literature oncriminology and psychology indicate that isolation can be sufficient in itselfgravely to impair physical and mental health. The following conditions may bediagnosed: chronic apathy, fatigue, emotional instability, difficulties ofconcentration, and diminution of mental faculties." [50]Criminologist Hans Toch observes,"unmitigated isolation is indisputably stressful,and it reliably overtaxes theresilience of many incarcerated offenders."[51]Psychologist Craig Haney notes:Empirical research on solitaryconfinement hasconsistently and unequivocally documented the harmful consequences of living inthese kinds of environments . Evidence of these negative psychological effectscomes from personal accounts, descriptive studies, and systematicresearchconducted over a period of four decades, by researchers from severaldifferent continents.[52]An American federal judge hasruled that prolonged solitary confinement "may press the outer bounds of whatmost humans can psychologically tolerate."[53]Even if they have no prior history of mentalillness, prisoners subjected to prolonged isolation may experience depression,despair, anxiety, rage, claustrophobia, hallucinations, problems with impulsecontrol, and/or an impaired ability to think, concentrate, or remember.[54]A statement by Dr. StuartGrassian submitted to the court in a 1995 case brought by prisoners againstofficials at Pelican Bay Prison in California, the United States, asserted,"Solitary and small group confinement can cause severe psychiatric harm inthe form of a specific syndrome that has been reported by many clinicians in avariety of settings."[55]Recognizing the health risks, theStandard Minimum Rules state, in Article 32:Punishment by closeconfinement or reduction of diet shall never be inflicted unless the medicalofficer has examined the prisoner and certified in writing that he is fit tosustain it.The medical officer shall visit daily prisoners undergoing suchpunishments and shall advise the director if he considers the termination oralteration of the punishment necessary on grounds of physical or mental health.Tunisia's prison law in Article 22also requires that the prison physician pre-approve decisions to place inmatesin solitary confinement as punishment, and to oversee theirimplementation.However, the politicalprisoners in prolonged solitary confinement are not placed there as an Article22 punishment and are not, to our knowledge, visited regularly by prisonphysicians.Both solitary confinement andsmall-group isolation are practiced in Tunisia.The latter involves confining prisoners to acell with a small number of cell-mates, all of whom are prevented from seeingother inmates or accessing prison facilities.(See, e.g., the case of Ridha Sadi, above.)Small-group isolation is, generally speaking,a regime less severe than solitary confinement.But it too can amount to ill-treatment that is potentially harmful to aninmate's mental health if, as in Tunisia, it allows him little or noaccess to educational or recreational activities, or other sources of mentalstimulation, and confines him to a monotonous, unvaried environment andinteraction with a strictly limited group of cell-mates.[56]Prison expert Andrew Coylewrites:[Placing] violent anddisruptive prisonersin isolated conditions, either on their own or with one ortwo other prisonersis not good practice.... A much more positive model is thatof housing problem prisoners in small units of up to ten prisoners, based onthe premise that it is possible to provide a positive regime for disruptiveprisoners by confining them to "group isolation" rather than individualsegregation.
