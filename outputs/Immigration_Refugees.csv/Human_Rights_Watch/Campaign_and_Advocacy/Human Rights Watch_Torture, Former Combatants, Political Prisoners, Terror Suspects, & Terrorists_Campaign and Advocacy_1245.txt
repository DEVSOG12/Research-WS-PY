The September 20 decision was based on evidence that the man was likely to be tortured because of his sexual orientation if he was returned to Jamaica. Successful claims under the CAT are rare, particularly those based on sexual orientation. We submitted both written and oral testimony at several points in the case, and helped the claimant to secure legal representation. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread and virulent homophobia in Jamaica, and in 2004 released a report showing how such abuses have undermined the country’s fight against HIV/AIDS. While the case is not over – the judge also recommended that the government appeal – it is an important acknowledgement of the severe abuses faced by gay Jamaicans.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAmericas JamaicaTopicLGBT Rights TortureMore ReadingOctober 14, 2022StatementGuatemala: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against WomenOctober 14, 2022DispatchesHonduras Should Commit to Protecting Women’s and Girls’ RightsReportsJuly 18, 2022Report“We Just Want to Live Our Lives”El Salvador’s Need for Legal Gender RecognitionOctober 7, 2020Report“Every Day I Live in Fear”Violence and Discrimination Against LGBT People inEl Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, andObstacles to Asylum in the United StatesMore ReadingOctober 14, 2022StatementGuatemala: Submission to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against WomenOctober 14, 2022DispatchesHonduras Should Commit to Protecting Women’s and Girls’ RightsMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
