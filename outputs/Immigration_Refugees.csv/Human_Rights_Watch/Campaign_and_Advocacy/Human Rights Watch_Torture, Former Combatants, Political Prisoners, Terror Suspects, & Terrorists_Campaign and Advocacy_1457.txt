In 1996 he was released from prison and his life sentence was suspended.As a long serving political prisoner in Iran, Amir-Entezam witnessed mass executions and other gross violations of human rights. He had spoken out frequently in the foreign press, criticizing those violations.On September 8, 1998, Amir-Entezam was detained at his home in Tehran following an interrogation earlier that day at court. The written summons cites "defamatory statements" he allegedly made about the former director of Iranian prisons, Assadollah Lajevardi, who was assassinated on August 23. Following the death of Mr. Lajevardi, Amir Entezam publicly condemned prison conditions and the treatment of prisoners in Iran during the period Lajevardi was in charge.On September 9, the court ordered Amir-Entezam's release from detention, but when his wife went to meet him at Tehran's Evin prison, she was told that the previously suspended life imprisonment sentence was now being reinforced. No further explanation was given for Amir-Entezam's continuing detention and he has not been permitted to meet with his lawyer."Amir-Entezam is being punished for his statements exposing harsh conditions in Iranian prisons and the widespread use of torture," said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. Megally called for his immediate and unconditional release. "If legal proceedings are to be brought against him for any reason," Megally said, "they should take place in public, and Amir-Entezam should be accorded all the safeguards to which he is entitled under the law."Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa IranMore ReadingOctober 24, 2022CommentaryWill Qatar and FIFA Remedy the Abuse of Migrant Workers?October 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 8, 2022Report“It Was Really Hard to Protect Myself”Impact of the Armed Conflict in Syria on Children with DisabilitiesMore ReadingOctober 24, 2022CommentaryWill Qatar and FIFA Remedy the Abuse of Migrant Workers?October 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
