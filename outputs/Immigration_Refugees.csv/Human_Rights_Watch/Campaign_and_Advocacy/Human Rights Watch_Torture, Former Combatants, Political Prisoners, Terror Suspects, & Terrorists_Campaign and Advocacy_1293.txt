another officer is shown kicking a handcuffed inmate in the head.When Florida inmate Frank Valdez died in 1999, every rib in his body was broken, his corpse bore the imprint of boot marks, and his testicles were badly swollen; guards admitted having struggled with him, but denied they had used excessive force.They claimed most of his injuries had been “self-inflicted.”In Maricopa County, Arizona, a sheriff who dresses male jail inmates in pink underwear introduced live “jail cam” broadcasts on the internet in 2000.Three cameras covered the holding and searching cells of the jail, including shots of strip searches, inmates bound in “restraint chairs,” and even, for a while, unobstructed views of women using the toilet.The broadcasts ended up being copied onto web porn sites.Even detained children and youth are not immune from staff brutality and abuse.They too are kicked, beaten, punched, choked, and sexually preyed upon by adult staff.The Maryland State Police recently filed criminal assault charges against staff at a youth facility in Maryland because of an incident in which one guard restrained a youth while the three others kicked him and punched him in the face.In January 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice reported on terrible conditions at Arizona’s juvenile detentions centers, including sexual abuse of the children by staff members (and fellow inmates) that occurs “with disturbing frequency” and a level of physical abuse that is ”equally disturbing.”When the news about Abu Ghraib broke, the Bush administration tried to suggest it was the work of a few rogue officers.But in over two decades of monitoring prisons in the United States and around the world, Human Rights Watch has learned that abusive officers do not operate in a vacuum.More typically, a culture of brutality has developed in which correctional officers know they can get away with excessive, unnecessary, or even purely malicious violence.In such prisons, senior officials have failed to communicate unequivocally—through training, staff supervision, investigations, and discipline—that abuse will not be tolerated.The failures of senior prison officials in the United States are compounded, as in Abu Ghraib, by the absence of external scrutiny.Prisons are closed institutions from which the press, human rights groups, and members of the public are typically excluded.Independent expert inspections yielding public findings are rare, and usually occur only after the situation has become so bad that inmates have filed a lawsuit.Perhaps if photos or videotapes of abuse in U.S. prisons were to circulate publicly, Americans would be galvanized to protest such treatment as they have the treatment of Iraqi prisoners.Absent such graphic and unavoidable evidence, it is all too likely that abuse will continue to be a part of many prison sentences.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited StatesTopicTortureMore ReadingJanuary 25, 2021CommentaryDeclassify the Post-9/11 Torture ProgramJuly 15, 2020LetterComment on proposed changes to procedures for asylum and withholding of removal;
