The UN report documents starvation, severe beatings, the prolonged use of stress positions, and psychological abuse. It also details the denial of medical care, sanitation, and hygiene products, all of which make for severe mental and physical suffering.These findings go beyond the landmark 2014 UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) report that, for the first time, put the UN spotlight on North Korea’s systematized, horrific rights violations. The COI report documented crimes committed before 2012 and were focused on crimes against humanity against certain groups the North Korean government considered serious criminals or enemies of the state (those held in political prison camps, ordinary prison camps, those forcibly returned from China, religious or subversive groups, and abductees).October 19, 2020“Worth Less Than an Animal”Abuses and Due Process Violations in Pretrial Detention in North KoreaDownload the full report in EnglishThese findings are consistent with Human Rights Watch’s own research on pre-trial detention and interrogation facilities (kuryujang) in North Korea.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged the international community to “prioritize justice and to take immediate steps to prevent further infliction of serious human rights violations against the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.”To do so, the UN Human Rights Council should continue to provide adequate resources to the UN Human Rights Office, including its Seoul office, to work on North Korea. When the council meets later this month, member states should work to adopt a strong resolution on North Korea, extending the mandate of its staff working on accountability, which ends in March 2021, and provide access to the Seoul office to specialized experts on financial accountability.The resolution should also strengthen the Seoul office’s existing mandate to “collect, consolidate, preserve, and analyze evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of international law,” as well as to “facilitate and expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings” in accordance with international law.As the UN report underlines, “there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity.”CorrectionClarification: Additional material was added to compare the findings of the new OHCHR report with the 2014 COI report.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia North KoreaTopicUnited Nations Human Rights CouncilMore ReadingJanuary 13, 2021News ReleaseNorth Korea: Covid-19 Intensified Systematic RepressionOctober 28, 2020DispatchesNorth Korea’s Unlawful ‘Shoot on Sight’ OrdersReportsSeptember 5, 2017ReportThe Costs of International AdvocacyChina’s Interference in United Nations Human Rights MechanismsSeptember 22, 2011ReportKeeping the MomentumOne Year in the Life of the UN Human Rights CouncilMore ReadingJanuary 13, 2021News ReleaseNorth Korea: Covid-19 Intensified Systematic RepressionOctober 28, 2020DispatchesNorth Korea’s Unlawful ‘Shoot on Sight’ OrdersMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
