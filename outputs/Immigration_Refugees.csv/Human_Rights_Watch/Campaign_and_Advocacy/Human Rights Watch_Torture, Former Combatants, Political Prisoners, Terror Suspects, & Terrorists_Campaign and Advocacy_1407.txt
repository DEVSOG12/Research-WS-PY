In July, 73 prisoners were released, timed for maximum political effect ahead of the president’s state visit to Europe. One former prisoner group estimates over 100 political prisoners remain behind bars. A government-backed committee met this past Friday to work on a final list.Yet in recent weeks, arrests for political actions or protests have risen markedly and none of these new prisoners are included on the lists.  Naw Ohn Hla, a former political prisoner and land rights activist was sentenced to two years on Friday for inciting unrest over a protest she led in mid-August against the controversial Letpadaung copper mine, site of numerous arrests and violent police crackdowns.In late August, six activists were arrested for allegedly staging a demonstration in violation of the peaceful assembly law, which bans any procession that does not receive prior permission, punishable by a year in prison. Farmers arrested for protests over rising land grabs are also arbitrarily detained or being charged for protesting without police authorization or belonging to unauthorized groups.Despite its public promises of reform, Burma’s government is arresting people who are peacefully resisting unfair laws and arbitrary power. Concerned government should hold Thein Sein to his July promise and demand the release of all political prisoners, new as well as old.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia Myanmar (Burma)More ReadingOctober 26, 2022DispatchesASEAN Ministers Hold Emergency Myanmar MeetingOctober 26, 2022CommentaryXi’s grip may have tightened, but he still has China’s long history of democratic protest to contend withReportsAugust 10, 2022Report“I Don’t Want to Change Myself”Anti-LGBT Conversion Practices, Discrimination, and Violence in MalaysiaApril 14, 2022Report“I Could Have Been Next”Stymied Reforms in the MaldivesMore ReadingOctober 26, 2022DispatchesASEAN Ministers Hold Emergency Myanmar MeetingOctober 26, 2022CommentaryXi’s grip may have tightened, but he still has China’s long history of democratic protest to contend withMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
