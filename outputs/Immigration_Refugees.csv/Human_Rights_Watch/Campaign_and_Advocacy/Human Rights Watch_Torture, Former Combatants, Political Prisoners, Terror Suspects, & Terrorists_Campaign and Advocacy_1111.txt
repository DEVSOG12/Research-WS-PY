The government should also undertake a broader campaign to end the longstanding use of corporal punishment in the armed forces, including by prosecuting military commanders for serious offenses by soldiers under their command.Click to expand ImagePvt. Yutthakinun Boonniam, 22, was beaten to death while detained in a military remand facility in Thailand's Surat Thani province during March 27 - 31, 2017.© 2017 PrivateOn April 1, 2017, Pvt. Yutthakinun Boonniam, 22, was pronounced dead at the Surat Thani Hospital, a day after he was brought in from the military remand facility at the 45th Military Circle Camp in Surat Thani province, where he had been detained since March 27 for disciplinary offenses. The doctors stated that he suffered many injuries, including kidney damage, apparently from severe beatings. Yatthakinun’s last words to his mother, who visited him at the hospital, were: “I was beaten up. It hurt so much.”“Another army conscript dies from an apparent beating, yet Thai leaders don’t seem interested in addressing the problem,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “The government and the military should urgently act to end these brutal assaults and the culture of impunity that has meant no punishment for abusive soldiers and the officers ultimately responsible.”On April 3, the army commander-in-chief, Gen. Chalermchai Sittisat, publicly expressed regret and apologized for Yutthakinun’s death. But while stating that corporal punishment was forbidden in military camps, General Chalermchai blamed the death on “old habits among soldiers who were previously deployed along Thailand’s border and are used to strict discipline and harsh punitive measures.”The army inducts about 100,000 conscripts across Thailand each year but fails to implement effective safeguards against torture and other human rights violations committed by officers or other soldiers.“Contrary to army spokesperson Col. Winthai Suvaree’s statement on April 3 that Yutthakinun’s death was an isolated incident, the Thai army faces a chronic inability to end abuses against its conscripts,” Adams said.​The government and the military should urgently act to end these brutal assaults and the culture of impunity that has meant no punishment for abusive soldiers and the officers ultimately responsible.Brad AdamsAsia DirectorIn another high-profile case reported by Human Rights Watch, there has been no progress in prosecuting the soldiers responsible for the death of Pvt. Wichian Puaksom, who was tortured to death while undergoing disciplinary punishment at the 151st Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division in Narathiwat province in June 2011.Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited under international treaties that Thailand has ratified. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment specifically places an obligation on governments to investigate and prosecute acts of torture and other ill-treatment.However, Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha’s repeated pledges to make torture a criminal offense under Thai law remain unfulfilled.Thai military personnel have also been repeatedly implicated in torture and other abuses against suspected insurgents and civilians in Thailand’s southern border provinces, where there has been a long-running insurgency.However, the government is not known to have prosecuted successfully any members of the security forces for torture or other serious abuses against civilians. In many cases, Thai authorities have provided financial compensation to the victims or their families in exchange for their agreement not to pursue criminal prosecution against abusive officials. There have also been many reported instances in which military officers retaliated against their accusers by filing criminal defamation lawsuits and alleging those complainants violated the Computer-Related Crime Act by disseminating false statements online.“Thailand’s military needs to take swift action to show that there will be no place in its ranks for those who believe they have unchecked powers to abuse other soldiers or anyone else,” Adams said. “The government and top military commanders should ensure that Private Yutthakinun’s death will be the last case of barrack brutality in Thailand.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia ThailandTopicTortureMore ReadingOctober 17, 2022News ReleaseSri Lanka: Draft ‘Rehabilitation’ Law Would Spur AbuseSeptember 14, 2022News ReleaseChina: Xinjiang Official Figures Reveal Higher Prisoner CountReportsAugust 16, 2021Report“Where No Sun Can Enter”A Decade of Enforced Disappearances in BangladeshJanuary 29, 2018ReportLocked Up Without EvidenceAbuses under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism ActMore ReadingOctober 17, 2022News ReleaseSri Lanka: Draft ‘Rehabilitation’ Law Would Spur AbuseSeptember 14, 2022News ReleaseChina: Xinjiang Official Figures Reveal Higher Prisoner CountMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
