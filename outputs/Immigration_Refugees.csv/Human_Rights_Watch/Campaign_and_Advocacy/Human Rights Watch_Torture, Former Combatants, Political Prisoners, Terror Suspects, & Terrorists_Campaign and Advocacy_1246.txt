Shortly after Human Rights Watch visited the Swaqa Correction and Rehabilitation Center, which houses more than 2,000 men, prison staff beat all or nearly all of the inmates. When we learned of the beatings, we returned to investigate. In an attempt to signal their distress, more than 350 prisoners slashed their bodies, a common form of protest in Jordanian prisons because the official complaints process does not function. We immediately contacted the Ministry of the Interior and the police, and the prison director under whose watch the beatings took place was swiftly removed.We visited the facility in the course of a larger investigation into allegations of torture and mistreatment in Jordan’s prisons, touring five of the country’s ten prisons. We found evidence of beatings in every prison we visited, and identified other serious problems including overcrowding and inadequate health care. Jordanian authorities granted us unprecedented access to the prisons after we exposed the use of arbitrary detention and torture in the General Intelligence Department’s detention facility last year, which operates separately from the country’s regular prison system. As we continue our work to improve conditions for detainees in Jordan, we are urging authorities to cease abusing prisoners, allow local activists regular access to all places of detention, institute effective processes for prisoners to report abuses, and hold those responsible judicially accountable.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryMiddle East/North Africa JordanTopicTortureMore ReadingOctober 10, 2022News ReleaseBahrain: Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 28, 2022CommentaryFree Abdulhadi Al-KhawajaReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 7, 2021Report“Security Forces Dealt with Them”Suspicious Killings and Extrajudicial Executions by Egyptian Security ForcesMore ReadingOctober 10, 2022News ReleaseBahrain: Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 28, 2022CommentaryFree Abdulhadi Al-KhawajaMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
