Under the Geneva Conventions, the United States must release those soldiers unless they are being charged with war crimes or other criminal offenses.The Geneva Conventions permit the extended detention of civilians captured in a war zone only after criminal prosecution or for “imperative reasons of security.” To invoke the security rationale, a decision must be made for each individual civilian in a regularized process that includes appeal and a review every six months. If people being held at Guantanamo had no connections to the Taliban or al-Qaeda, it is difficult to conceive how their detention could be considered “imperative” for national security.The United States is also holding alleged al-Qaeda terrorists picked up in places other than Afghanistan. The Geneva Conventions do not apply when terrorist suspects are apprehended outside areas of armed conflict and have no direct connection to such conflict, such as those apprehended in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But the suspects are not left without any legal protection. International human rights law requires that they be formally charged, informed of their rights, and permitted access to legal counsel. International humanitarian law provides no basis for circumventing these human rights requirements by purporting to hold such persons as “enemy combatants.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia United States AfghanistanTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism GuantanamoMore ReadingMay 28, 2002LetterU.S.: Growing Problem Of Guantanamo DetaineesReportsApril 14, 2022Report“I Could Have Been Next”Stymied Reforms in the MaldivesFebruary 7, 2022Report“In a Legal Black Hole”Sri Lanka’s Failure to Reform the Prevention of Terrorism ActMore ReadingMay 28, 2002LetterU.S.: Growing Problem Of Guantanamo DetaineesMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
