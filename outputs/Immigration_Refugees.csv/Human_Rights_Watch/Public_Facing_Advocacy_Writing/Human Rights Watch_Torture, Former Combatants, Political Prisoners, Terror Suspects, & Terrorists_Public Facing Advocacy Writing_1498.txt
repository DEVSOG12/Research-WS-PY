The tribute paid by the parliamentarian Jair Bolsonaro—at the vote on the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff—to a notorious torturer from the period of the dictatorship leaves no doubt: Brazilian politicians, too, attempt to justify what is unjustifiable.The abuse of detainees by Brazillian public security officials remains one of the most pressing human rights problems in this country. In 2014, Human Rights Watch documented 64 cases of serious violations carried out by security forces or prison personnel. During legal hearings in the past year, 2,700 detainees alleged ill-treatment or torture at the hands of police. A 2014 poll showed about a fifth of all Brazilians supported using torture if it were the only way to obtain evidence or punish criminals.Apart from the dreadful speech of Bolsonaro, Brazilian politicians do not endorse the use of torture openly. It is particularly troubling that, in the United States, several candidates for president did. The rousing applause the candidates have gotten when voicing their support for torture is shameful.The remaining Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has issued a written statement not only embracing “enhanced interrogation” but adding that “nothing should be taken off the table when American lives are at stake.” He later acknowledged that using at least some of these techniques would be illegal but vowed that he would work to change the law.The CIA bears some of the blame for the way Trump—and the earlier candidates—see the issue. The main finding of a scathing study by the US Senate Intelligence Committee more than a year ago was that that the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” was an ineffective means of gathering useful intelligence. In response, the CIA admitted mistakes were made. However, it strongly refuted the Senate study’s main finding and continues to insist that enhanced interrogation techniques, whether properly authorized or not, were useful.President Barack Obama also deserves some of the blame. Although he ended the “enhanced interrogation program,” his administration has refused to prosecute anyone responsible for authorizing it or carrying it out– or even for going beyond what was authorized.  The two remaining Democratic Party candidates have condemned torture in general terms, but neither has said they would prosecute those involved in the program who were acting on government orders.Overwhelmingly, experts agree that torture produces unreliable information, and that it undermines attempts to get detainees to cooperate. But that’s not the only reason why nations should reject torture. They should do so because it is cruel and inhumane to abuse someone in custody. That is also why international conventions ban it, as do the laws of many countries, including the United States and Brazil.Torture has destroyed the lives of detainees and done enormous damage to the reputation of the US. The use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” and the government’s failure to reject them fully even now, have made it much harder for the US to advocate against abusive detention practices and other rights violations around the world.The Obama administration still has time to demonstrate a clear US position on the illegality of the “enhanced interrogation techniques.” The most effective way to do that is by prosecuting those responsible for the torture.The same holds true for Brazil. As long as impunity reigns, torture will persist.A version of this article was published in the print version of weekly magazine Carta Capital.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAmericas Brazil United States National SecurityTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism CIA Activities TortureMore ReadingDecember 10, 2014News ReleaseBrazil: Panel Details ‘Dirty War’ AtrocitiesDecember 1, 2015InterviewInterview: Torture and the CIAReportsSeptember 11, 2020ReportJustice as a WeaponPolitical Persecution in BoliviaFebruary 5, 2020ReportDeported to DangerUnited States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and AbuseMore ReadingDecember 10, 2014News ReleaseBrazil: Panel Details ‘Dirty War’ AtrocitiesDecember 1, 2015InterviewInterview: Torture and the CIAMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
