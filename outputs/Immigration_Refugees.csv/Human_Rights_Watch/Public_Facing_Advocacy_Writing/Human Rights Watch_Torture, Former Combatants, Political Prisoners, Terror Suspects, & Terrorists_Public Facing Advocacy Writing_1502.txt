As it went viral this week, Afghan officials have tried to contain the damage, while vowing those responsible would be punished.A Kandahar police spokesman said that two of its personnel were prosecuted and are currently behind bars for their role in the incident.  The Ministry subsequently issued a statement concurring with that account. No further details have been forthcoming.Prosecution and imprisonment of Afghan security forces personnel implicated in torture would be a first. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, while there is increased awareness of human rights standards among Afghan National Police (ANP) and National Directorate of Security (NDS) personnel, there has been “no progress on accountability for alleged torture and ill-treatment” security forces.According to one report, Kandahar police involved in the torture appear to be trying to coerce a confession from the suspect, shouting “Now do you admit it?” as they prepare to drag him behind a police vehicle. In Afghanistan, torture is widely seen as the most effective way to get a confession. Although the Afghan Penal Code criminalizes torture, and prohibits the use of coerced confessions in court, judges almost never reject such evidence. Indeed, the criminal justice system continues to rely almost entirely on confessions to obtain a conviction.The fact that the incident took place in Kandahar is no surprise. A UN report released in February 2015 noted that 58 percent of detainees interviewed in Kandahar had been tortured. Since Gen. Raziq took charge of the Kandahar police in 2011, brutality by police has spiked. Over the past two years, dozens of Kandahari residents have been tortured to death by the province’s police.In a January 7, 2015 letter to Human Rights Watch, President Ashraf Ghani pledged “the Afghan government will not tolerate torture.” Ghani added that his government’s “commitment to human rights and rule of law is strong and we are serious in addressing the allegations of torture in our security sector.” Although Ghani followed up on that pledge in January 2016 by launching a national action plan to eliminate torture, progress on finalizing both anti-torture policy and legislation has stalled. In the absence of any meaningful deterrent, Afghan security forces continue to engage in the systematic use of torture.Ghani should launch a thorough probe into the Kandahar torture incident to ensure that those responsible are actually punished.  The Kandahar torture video gives Ghani the chance to show whether his stated commitment to ending impunity for torture is government policy—or just more rhetoric.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia AfghanistanTopicTortureMore ReadingOctober 17, 2022News ReleaseSri Lanka: Draft ‘Rehabilitation’ Law Would Spur AbuseSeptember 14, 2022News ReleaseChina: Xinjiang Official Figures Reveal Higher Prisoner CountReportsNovember 30, 2021Report“No Forgiveness for People Like You”Executions and Enforced Disappearances in Afghanistan under the TalibanAugust 16, 2021Report“Where No Sun Can Enter”A Decade of Enforced Disappearances in BangladeshMore ReadingOctober 17, 2022News ReleaseSri Lanka: Draft ‘Rehabilitation’ Law Would Spur AbuseSeptember 14, 2022News ReleaseChina: Xinjiang Official Figures Reveal Higher Prisoner CountMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
