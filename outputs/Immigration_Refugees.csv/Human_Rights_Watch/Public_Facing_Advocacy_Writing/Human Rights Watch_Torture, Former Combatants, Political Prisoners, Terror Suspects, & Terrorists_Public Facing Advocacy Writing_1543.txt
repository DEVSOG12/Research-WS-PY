In interviews, these people told us that they had wanted to commit suicide to end the pain, or told doctors or relatives that they wanted to die.[iii]The Committee has stated that cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment "may differ [from torture] in the severity of pain and suffering and does not require proof of impermissible purposes."[iv]  The Committee has further stated that the Convention requires States parties to take "effective preventative measures" and "eliminate any legal or other obstacles that impede the eradication of torture and ill-treatment."[v]As all strong pain medications are narcotics regulated by international drug conventions, their production, distribution and dispensing is under exclusive government control.[vi]  Without government action, including appropriate legislative measures, to ensure their availability, severe pain and suffering is inevitable.  Human Rights Watch firmly believes that where governments fail to take steps to make pain medications available, widespread denial of access to appropriate pain treatment should be considered a violation of the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  We therefore encourage the Committee to examine Cameroon's record on providing access to treatment for severe pain as part of its review of Cameroon's compliance with its obligations under Article 16 of the Convention.Background: pain and pain managementPrevalence of painThe World Health Organization ("WHO") estimates that tens of millions of people worldwide suffer from moderate to severe pain without access to treatment, including 5.5 million terminal cancer patients and 1 million end-stage HIV/AIDS patients, even though pain medications are safe, effective and inexpensive.[vii]  A March 2009 Human Rights Watch report, "Please, do not make us suffer anymore...": Access to Pain Treatment as a Human Right, concluded that a "shocking willingness by many governments around the world to stand by passively as people suffer" was a chief reason for this situation.[viii]Chronic, moderate and severe pain is a common symptom of cancer and HIV/AIDS, as well as of various other health conditions. A recent review of studies of pain among cancer patients found that more than 50 percent of cancer patients experience pain symptoms,[ix] and research consistently finds that 60 to 90 percent of patients with advanced cancer experience moderate to severe pain.[x]  Although no population-based studies of HIV/AIDS related pain have been published, multiple studies report that 60 to 80 percent of patients in the last phases of the illness experience significant pain.[xi]  One authoritative study estimates that 80 percent of terminal cancer patients and 50 percent of terminal HIV/AIDS patients will develop moderate to severe pain symptoms, on average for a period of about 90 days.[xii]Pain management: elements, effectiveness, costThe basis for modern pain management is the WHO's Pain Relief Ladder, which recommends the administration of different types of pain medications according to the severity of the pain. With the use of the Pain Relief Ladder, WHO estimates that most, if not all, pain due to cancer could be relieved.[xiii]  While originally developed for treating cancer pain, the Pain Relief Ladder has been applied successfully to other types of pain.The mainstay medication for treating moderate to severe pain is morphine, an opioid that is made of an extract of the poppy plant.  Oral morphine is the drug of choice for chronic pain, and can be taken in institutional settings and at home.  Due to the potential for its abuse, morphine is a controlled medication, meaning that its manufacture, distribution and dispensing is strictly controlled both at the international and national levels.Basic oral morphine in powder or tablet form is not protected by any patent and can be produced for as little as US$0.01 per milligram.[xiv] A typical daily dose in low and middle income countries ranges, according to one estimate, from 60 to 75 milligrams per day.[xv] Because oral morphine can be produced cheaply, providing pain management should be possible at the community level even in developing countries.Chronic pain management is often a part of broader palliative care services, which aim to improve the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with life-limiting illnesses.[xvi]Widespread consensus: pain relief medications must be availableThere is a decades-old and widespread consensus that states must make opioid pain medications, including morphine, available for people facing severe pain. The 1961 SingleConvention on Narcotic Drugs ("Narcotic Drugs Convention") recognized that narcotic drugs continue to be "indispensible for the relief of pain and suffering" and that states must make "adequate provision...to ensure" their availability.[xvii] The International Narcotics Control Board, the body charged with overseeing the implementation of the UN drug conventions, clarified in 1995 that the Narcotic Drugs Convention establishes an obligation "to ensure adequate availability of narcotic drugs, including opiates, for medical and scientific purposes..."[xviii]WHO has included opioid pain relievers, including morphine, in its Model List of Essential Medicines, a list of the minimum essential medications that should be available to all persons who need them. WHO has also repeatedly emphasized that palliative care and pain treatment are an essential-not optional-component of care for cancer and HIV/AIDS.[xix]  Professor Manfred Nowak, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, recommended in his report to the Human Rights Council in February 2009 that "all measures should be taken to...overcome current regulatory, educational and attitudinal obstacles to ensure full access to palliative care."[xx]The situation in CameroonIn Cameroon, more than 50,000 people die from HIV/AIDS, and more than 27,000 people from cancer, each year.[xxi] Research suggests that about 80 percent of terminal cancer patients and 50 percent of terminal HIV/AIDS patients will suffer from moderate to severe pain for an average of about three months before their death.[xxii]  In addition, thousands of other Cameroonians will face moderate to severe pain due to other health conditions, including non-terminal cancer and injuries.[xxiii]Adequate pain treatment for all of Cameroon's terminal cancer and HIV/AIDS patients would require consumption of an estimated 288 kg of morphine per year.[xxiv]  As a signatory to the Narcotic Drugs Convention, Cameroon is obliged to report its annual consumption of morphine and other opioids to the International Narcotics Control Board.[xxv]  Cameroon has not reported consumption figures since 2004, when it reported that it consumed less than half a kilogram of morphine.[xxvi]  This is sufficient to treat an estimated 82 terminal cancer or HIV/AIDS patients, approximately 0.2 percent of those requiring pain treatment in Cameroon.[xxvii]Information gathered by Human Rights Watch suggests that this situation is due, in large part, to the failure by the government of Cameroon to take reasonable steps to ensure that people who face severe pain have access to appropriate treatment.  In particular, Cameroon has failed: to put in place a functioning supply system for morphine; to enact policies that would ensure pain treatment access; and to ensure that healthcare workers receive adequate training on pain management and palliative care.Supply and distribution systemLack of access to pain medication must be seen in the context of Cameroon's poor health infrastructure and the government's failure to meet its commitments to allocate more of its budget to healthcare to achieve progressive realization of the right to health.[xxviii]  Yet, even where more expensive medications are available, opioids often are not.  As the production, distribution and dispensing of controlled medications, like morphine, is under exclusive government control, without government action, these medications will simply not be available.Cameroon has failed to put in place an adequate supply and distribution system.  States are required to submit estimates of their need for opioids for medical and scientific purposes annually to the International Narcotics Control Board and may not import opioids in excess of the estimates approved by the Board.[xxix]  Cameroon has not submitted a consumption estimate for morphine, or any other opioid, for 2009.[xxx]  For 2008, Cameroon estimated its morphine consumption would be just 280 grams, enough to treat just 46 terminal cancer or HIV/AIDS patients, or 0.1 percent of those in need of pain relief.[xxxi]To its credit, the government has included injectable morphine, oral morphine solution and morphine tablets on Cameroon's national list of essential medicines, in line with the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.[xxxii]  The government has failed, however, to ensure a supply of oral morphine.  As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to establish, it appears that  morphine tablets are not, in practice, available in Cameroon.[xxxiii]  At least one health service run by a non-government organization imports oral morphine because it is not able to purchase it in Cameroon, indicating that the government has not taken the necessary steps to put in place functioning supply and distribution of oral morphine.  The Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board ("CBC Health Board") received authorization from the Ministry of Health to import morphine powder in order to make morphine solution to use its two palliative care facilities.[xxxiv]  As oral morphine solution is an extremely cost effective medication that can be used to provide pain relief to patients being cared for at home, the government should be urged make it more broadly available in Cameroon.The need to enact appropriate policiesThe right to the highest attainable standard of health requires that countries adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action on the basis of epidemiological evidence, addressing the health concerns of the whole population.[xxxv]  In 1996, WHO identified the absence of national policies on cancer pain relief and palliative care as one of the reasons that, in many countries around the world, cancer pain is so often inadequately treated.[xxxvi]  Despite efforts of palliative care advocates, Cameroon does not have a written palliative care policy or plan of action and palliative care is not included in the national cancer policy.[xxxvii]  A team of local experts formed under the auspices of the African Palliative Care Association to improve access to palliative care in Cameroon cited lack of government attention to palliative care as hindering broader access.[xxxviii]Training for healthcare workersWithout adequate instruction on palliative care and pain management, the healthcare system will be unable to provide patients with the treatment they require.  The above mentioned team of experts cited limited expertise in palliative care and healthcare workers' attitudes towards opioid medications as major barriers to access.  Lack of awareness in the broader community of palliative care as a treatment option was also identified as a problem.[xxxix]  Instruction in palliative care is not provided as part of the undergraduate or post-graduate medical or nursing curriculum in Cameroon.[xl]  The few doctors and nurses that have received training in palliative care have done so in Uganda or through the efforts of NGOs.  The CBC Health Board employs one doctor and a handful of nurses who have received formal training in palliative care at Ugandan medical schools or at Hospice Africa Uganda.  One nurse serves as a palliative care trainer for other staff.[xli]Recommendations for steps the government of Cameroon should be urged to take:Human Rights Watch submits that many terminal cancer and HIV/AIDS and other patients in Cameroon are suffering from severe pain because the government of Cameroon has failed to undertake basic steps to ensure their access to opioid pain medications.  Indeed, the failure of the government to put in place an adequate supply and distribution system, enact relevant national policies and introduce instruction for healthcare workers condemns to great suffering tens of thousands of people who will develop severe pain symptoms in years to come, as the appropriate infrastructure for providing pain relief is not in place.  The government of Cameroon should be urged to develop and implement a strategy and plan of action for removing barriers to availability of medical opioids and ensuring adequate supply and distribution.  It should urgently implement low-cost reforms that would improve access to opioids for pain relief, such as adopting appropriate policy documents, introducing relevant education for healthcare workers and making oral morphine solution more widely available.[i] Human Rights

Foley et al., "Pain Control for People with Cancer and AIDS" in Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 981‐994.[xxiii] Non‐lethal cancer, lethal and non‐lethal HIV/AIDS, lethal and non‐lethal injuries, and various other health conditions can cause moderate to severe pain requiring opioid pain medications.  An estimated 540,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Cameroon (WHO, UNAIDS, "Epidemiological Fact Sheet on HIV and AIDS: Cameroon, 2008 Update," September 2008, http://apps.who.int/globalatlas/predefinedReports/EFS2008/full/EFS2008_C... [accessed August 7, 2009], p.4) tens of thousands of people die of injuries each year (WHOSIS, accessed July 15, 2009), and thousands more suffer from non‐terminal cancer.[xxiv] The calculation is based on an estimate by K. M. Foley and others that 80% of terminal cancer patients and 50% of terminal AIDS patients will require an average of 90 days of pain treatment with 60 to 75 mg of morphine per day: K. M.

Foley, et al., "Pain Control for People with Cancer and AIDS" in Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 981‐994.[xxviii]Cameroon has committed to a target of allocating 15% of government spending on the improving the health sector (Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, April 27, 2001, Abuja, Nigeria, OAU/SPS/ABUJA/3). Government spending on health care reached 10% of total spending between 2003 and 2005, before declining to 8.6% of total government spending in 2006, the last year for which statistics are available (statistics from the World Health Organization Statistical Information System (WHOSIS) http://www.who.int/whosis/en/index.html [accessed August 19, 2009]).  Cameroon has considerable oil revenues but is ranked 141st of 180 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table). Corruption at all levels of government impedes greater investment in healthcare and leads to the diversion of invested funds.  Equally, healthcare provider's demands for ‘informal payments' are a barrier to healthcare access.[xxix] Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, arts. 21 and 31; International Narcotics Control Board, "Training Material: 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Part 1 - The International Control System for Narcotic Drugs", UN Doc.
