Now in ratifying OPCAT the Australian Government will demonstrate, nationally and internationally, its commitment to safeguarding the human rights of people deprived of their liberty in all places of detention, including prisons, police lock ups, juvenile detention centres, immigration detention centres, mental health facilities and forensic disability units.The aim of OPCAT is to strengthen the protection of persons deprived of their liberty through non-judicial means of a preventative nature. We strongly support this goal and believe that independent monitoring by autonomous bodies under OPCAT will serve to strengthen a culture of human rights within Australian detention facilities.Since Australia signed OPCAT in 2009, a National Interest Analysis has been conducted and in 2012 the bipartisan Joint Standing Committee on Treaties completed an inquiry into Australia’s ratification of OPCAT. We strongly support the recommendation of the Committee that the Australian Government work in collaboration with the States and Territories to ratify OPCAT and implement a NPM as soon as possible.In supporting the recommendation of the Committee, we point to the importance of the accountability mechanism provided by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT). The Committee identified that the SPT has proven to be a valuable and successful mechanism in exercising oversight and providing support for State Parties as they implement OPCAT.Ratification of OPCAT would provide the opportunity for the SPT to lend its expertise to Federal, State and Territory jurisdictions in aligning existing mechanisms to meet the requirements of OPCAT, particularly the establishment and implementation of a NPM. Australian jurisdictions have monitoring bodies already in existence and ratification of OPCAT would allow cooperation with the SPT to modify these institutions under guidance to form a NPM.The Australian Government has stated its intention to postpone the implementation of a NPM. We do not support this intention as delayed implementation of a NPM would render Australia’s ratification of OPCAT symbolic rather than effective, potentially compromising Australia’s stated commitment to human rights.In light of the consultative processes already undertaken by the Australian Government and the initiation of a collaborative approach between the Federal, State and Territory Governments to reform existing inspection bodies, there exist no reasonable obstacles to Australia’s immediate ratification of OPCAT and the implementation of a NPM.OPCAT, the SPT and the NPM bodies safeguard the human rights of people in custodial settings and provide independent oversight of places of detention. The transparency and accountability offered by OPCAT and its mechanisms provide Australia with the opportunity to act as regional and global model for best practice on human rights in places of detention.In the lead up to Australia's review before the UN Committee against Torture in Geneva in 2014, we call on the Australian Federal, State and Territory Governments to commit to ratifying OPCAT in full and implementing a NPM without delay.Yours sincerely,The undersigned organisationsAct for PeaceActionAidAfghan Australian Development OrganisationAmnesty InternationalANTaRAssociation for the Prevention of TortureAssociation for Services to Torture and Trauma SurvivorsAsylum Seekers CentreAsylum Seeker Resource CentreAustralian Churches Refugee TaskforceAustralian Council for International Development (representing over 140 member organisations)Australian Lawyers AllianceAustralian Lawyers for Human RightsAustralian Tamil CongressCastan Centre for Human Rights LawCentre for Peace and Conflict StudiesChildren with Disability AustraliaChilOutCivil Liberties AustraliaCompanion House Assisting Survivors of Torture and TraumaConsumers Health Forum of AustraliaDisability Discrimination Legal ServiceDomestic Violence Legal Workers' NetworkEdmund Rice CentreEquality Rights Alliance (representing 62 member organisations)Federation of Community Legal Centres VictoriaForum of Australian Services for Survivors of Torture and TraumaFoundation HouseHuman Rights Law CentreHuman Rights WatchHunter Community Legal CentreIslamic Relief AustraliaJesuit Refugee ServiceKingsford Legal CentreMahboba’s PromiseMedical Association for Prevention of WarMelaleuca Refugee Centre Torture and Trauma Survivors Service of the Northern Territory IncMental Health Carers ARAFMI AustraliaNational Association of Community Legal CentresNational Child Rights TaskforceNational Children’s and Youth Law CentreNational Congress of Australia's First PeoplesOxfam AustraliaPeople with Disability AustraliaPhoenix Centre Support Service for Survivors of Torture and TraumaPublic Health Association of AustraliaPublic Interest Advocacy Centre LtdQueensland Advocacy IncorporatedQueensland Program of Assistance to Survivors of Torture and TraumaRefugee Council of AustraliaSave the ChildrenSCALES Community Legal CentreService for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma SurvivorsSettlement Council of AustraliaSisters InsideSurvivors of Torture and Trauma Assistance and Rehabilitation Service IncTEAR AustraliaUN Association of AustraliaUniting Church in Australia AssemblyWomen’s Electoral LobbyWomen's Law CentreWomen's Legal Services AustraliaWomen with Disabilities AustraliaYWCA AustraliaCopy to:Mr Simon Corbell MP, ACT Attorney-GeneralHon Bradley Hazzard MP, NSW Attorney-GeneralHon Johan Wessel Elferink MLA, NT Attorney-GeneralHon Jarrod Bleijie MP, QLD Attorney-GeneralMr Jon Rau MP, SA Attorney-GeneralMs Vanessa Goodwin MLC, TAS Attorney-GeneralHon Robert Clark MP, VIC Attorney-GeneralHon Michael Mischin MLC, WA Attorney-GeneralYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAustraliaTopicTortureMore ReadingNovember 25, 2013News ReleaseAustralia: Prime Minister Should Retract Torture RemarksNovember 25, 2013LetterJoint letter on Australia’s commitment to the absolute prohibition against tortureReportsOctober 10, 2022Report“The Court is Satisfied with the Confession”Bahrain Death Sentences Follow Torture, Sham TrialsSeptember 27, 2022Report“We Deserve to Have a Place to Live”How US Underfunding Public Housing Harms Rights in New York, New Mexico, and BeyondMore ReadingNovember 25, 2013News ReleaseAustralia: Prime Minister Should Retract Torture RemarksNovember 25, 2013LetterJoint letter on Australia’s commitment to the absolute prohibition against tortureMost ViewedNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleOctober 26, 2022News ReleaseChad: Scores of Protesters Shot Dead, WoundedNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
