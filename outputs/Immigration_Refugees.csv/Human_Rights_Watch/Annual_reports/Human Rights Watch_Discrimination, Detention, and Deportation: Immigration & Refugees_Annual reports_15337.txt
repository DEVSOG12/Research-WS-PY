With Autocrats on the Defensive,  
Can Democrats Rise to the Occasion? 
By Kenneth Roth, Executive Director 
The conventional wisdom these days is that autocracy is ascendent, democracy 
on the decline. That view gains currency from the intensifying crackdown on op-
position voices in China, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Turkey, Thailand, Egypt, Uganda, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. It finds support in military takeovers in Myanmar, Sudan, Mali, and Guinea, and undemocratic transfers of power in Tunisia and Chad . And it gains suste nance from the emer-
gence of leaders with autocratic tendencie s in once- or still-established democ-
racies such as Hungary, Poland, Brazil, El Salvador, India, the Philippines, and, until a year ago, the United States. 
But the superficial appe al of the ri se-of-autocracy  thesis belies a more complex 
reality—and a bleaker future for autocrats. As people see that unaccountable rulers inevitably prioritize their own interests over the public’s, the popular de-mand for rights-respecting democracy often re mains strong. In country after 
country, large numbers of people have recently taken to the streets, even at the risk of being arrested or shot. There are few rallies for autocratic rule.  
In some countries ruled  by autocrats that  retain at least a sembl ance of demo-
cratic elections, opposition political parties have begun to paper over their pol-
icy differences to build alliances in pursuit of their common interest in ousting 
the autocrat. And as autocrats can no longer rely on subtly manipulated elec-
tions to preserve power, a growing number are resorting to overt electoral cha-rades that guarantee their desired result but confer none of the legitimacy 
sought from holding an election.  
Yet, autocrats are enjoying their moment in the sun in part because of the fail-
ings of democratic leaders. Democracy may be the least bad form of governance, as Winston Churchill observed, becau se the electorate can vote the government 
out, but today’s democratic leaders are not meeting the challenges before them. 
Whether it is the climate crisis, the Covid-19 p andemic, poverty and inequality, 
racial injustice, or the threats from modern technology, these leaders are often 
too mired in partisan battle s and short-term preoccu pations to address these 
1HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHproblems effectively. Some populist politicians try to divert attention with racist, 
sexist, xenophobic or homophobic appeals, leaving re al solutions elusive.  
If democracies are to prevail in the global contest with autocracy, their leaders 
must do more than spotlight the autocr ats’ inevitable shortcomings. They need 
to make a stronger, positive case f or democratic rule. That means doing a better 
job of meeting national and global challenges—of making sure that democracy delivers on its promised dividends. It means standing up for democratic institu-tions such as independent courts, free media, robust legislatures, and vibrant 
civil soc ieties even when that  brings unwelcome scrutiny or challenges to execu-
tive policies. And it demands elevating public discourse rather than stoking our worst sentiments, acting on democratic principles rather than merely voicing them, unifying us before looming threats rather than dividing us in the quest for another do-nothing term in office.  
Most of the world today looks to democratic leaders to solve our biggest prob-
lems. The Chinese and Russian leaders did not even bother showing up at the climate summit in Glasgow. But if democratic officials continue to fail us, if they are unable to  summon the visionary leadership th at this dem anding era re-
quires, they risk fueling the frustration and desp air that are fertile ground for the 
autocrats. 
The Perils of Unaccountable Autocrats 
The first goal of most autocrats is to chip away at the checks and balances on their authority. Democracy worthy of its name requires not only periodic elec-tions but also free public debate, a healthy civil society , competit ive political 
parties, and an independent judiciary capable of defending individual rights and holding officials to the rule of law. As if autocrats all read from the same play-book, they inevitably attack these restraints on their power—independent jour-nalists, act ivists, judges, politic ians, and human rights defenders. The 
importance of the se checks and balances was visi ble in the Unit ed Sta tes where 
they impeded President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 election, and in Brazil where they are already w orking to impede President Jair Bolsonaro’s 
threat to do the same in the election scheduled for 2022. 
A lack of democratic process leaves autocrats unaccountable to the public. That 
makes them more likely to serve their o wn political interests— and those of their WORLD REPORT 2022
2cronies or military supporters. Autocrats  claim to deliver better results than de-
mocrats, but they usually deliver mainly for themselves.  
The Covid-19 pandemic spotlighted this self -serving tendency. Many autocratic 
leaders downplayed the pandemic, turned their backs on scientific evidence, 
spread false information, and failed to ta ke basic steps to protect the health and 
lives of the public. Their motives ranged from populist pandering to evading criti-cism for not having done enough to prevent the virus from spreading or to buoy social-protection systems. As infections and deaths surged, some of those lead-
ers threatened, silenced, or even imprisoned  the healthcare workers, journalists 
and others who reported, protested, or criticized their failed response—causing 
a lack of public debate that tended to breed distrust and make matters even 
worse.  
Variations of this scenario played out in Egypt, India, Hungary, Greece, Tajik-
istan, Brazil, Mexico, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Tanzania under the late President John Magufuli, and the United States u nder Trump. Some autocrats used the 
pandemic as a pretext to halt demons trations against their rule, while at times 
allowing rallies in their favor, as in Ug anda, Russia, Thailand, Cambodia, and 
Cuba. 
Even in China, where the government’s vas t lockdowns limited Covid-19’s 
spread, the official cover- up of human-to-h uman transmission in Wuhan during 
the critical first three weeks of Januar y 2020 while millions fled or passed 
through the city helped the virus go global. To this day, Beijing refuses to cooper-ate with an independent investigation into the origins of the virus.  
Autocrats also frequently dev ote government resources to self-serving projects 
rather than public needs. In Hungary, for example, Prime Minister Viktor Orban 
has spent  European Union su bsidies on footba ll stadiums, which he used  to pay 
off cronies, while leaving hospitals in a decrepit state. In Egypt, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi allowed healthcare facilities to languish while the army and its vast business enterprises flourished, and he pu rsued such grandiose projects as 
building a new administrative capital to the east of Cairo. As Russia’s economy declined, the Kremlin increased spending on the military and the police. 
Autocrats’ ability to act more quickly, unencumbered by the checks and balances 
of democracy, can paradoxically be their undoing. The free debate of democratic 
3HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHrule can slow decision-making, but it also ens ures that diverse views are heard. 
Autocrats tend to suppress opposing v iews, leading to such ill-considered deci-
sions as the move by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to lower interest rates in the face of spiraling inflation. Sri Lanka’s former president, Mahinda Ra-japaksa, built a port with Chinese loans  and rushed through construction, lead-
ing to economic losses so great that Beijing gained control of the port for 99 years. India’s economic gro wth has yet to recover fully  from the abrupt  decis ion 
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government  to eliminate high-value currency 
notes—an effort to contain corruption that hurt the most marginalized people who rely prim arily on cash for subsi stence. 
As Chinese President Xi Jinping consolidates his individual power, he needs to 
address the challenges of a slowing econom y, a debt cr isis, a hous ing bubble, a 
shrinking workforce as the popul ation ages, and troubling inequality—without 
free debate about solutions by the countr y’s citizens. Similar one-man rule previ-
ously led to the Chinese C ommunist Par ty’s disastro us Cultural Revolution and 
Great Leap Forward, which killed millions  of people. Yet instead of encouraging 
public discussion of how to manage today’s problems, Xi is overseeing crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, bending the legal system to his will, purging politi-
cal allies, and extending the surveillance st ate into every nook and cranny of the 
country. Such un challenged  decision-making is a recipe for disast rous mistakes. 
The Popular Embrace of Democracy 
Even when intru sive surveillanc e and severe repress ion ultimately  curtail 
demonstrations, the large numbers of people who joined them showed the pub-lic’s desire for democracy. Repression ma y yield resignation, but that should not 
be confused with support. Few people want the oppression, corruption, and mis-management of autocratic rule. 
Many autocrats thought they had learned to manipulate voters through managed 
elections. They would allow periodic balloting, but only after, by their calcula-tion, tilting the playing field sufficiently to pr evail. They would censor the media, 
limit civil- society org anizations, disqualify opponents, and selectively confer 
state benefits. Some would demonize disfavored groups— immigrants and asy-lum seekers, lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender (LGBT) people, racial or reli-
gious minorities, women who demand their rights—t o divert attention from their WORLD REPORT 2022
4inability or unwi llingne ss to deliver actual resu lts. This m anipulation was often 
enough to declare “victory” but not so blatant as to deprive the exercise of all le-gitimacy. 
As the corruption and mismanagement of autocratic rule became undeniable, 
though, some voters became less susceptible to the autocrats’ election-manage-ment techniques. In certain countries wher e some degree of political pluralism 
was still tolerated, broad coalitions of po litical parties have  begun to form, span-
ning the political spectrum. Such alliances  reflect growing awareness that parti-
san differences pale in comparison to a common interest in removing a corrupt 
or autocratic ruler.  
In the Czech Republic, such a coalition defeated Prime Minister Andrej Babiš at 
the ballot box. In Israel, a broad coalition ended the long-time rule of Prime Min-ister Benjamin Netanyahu. Similar alliances  of opposition parties have formed 
ahead of forthcoming elections against Orban in Hungary and Erdoğan in Turkey. A comparable tendency within the US Democratic Party contributed to the selec-tion of Joe Biden to contest the 2020 election against Trump.  
Electoral Charades 
In these circumstances, managed elections have become less effective, forcing 
autocrats to resort to increasingly st ark forms of electoral manipulation. For 
Russian parliamentary elections, the authorities disqualified virtually every vi-able opposition candidate, banned protests, and silenced critical journalists and 
activists. Russi an authorities imprisoned  the leading oppo sition figure, Alexei 
Navalny (after nearly killing him with a nerve agent), designated his organiza-
tions as “extremist,” and hindered efforts by his team to organize a “smart vot-
ing” strategy to select the least objectionable remaining opponent of the ruling party.  
In Hong Kong, where an informal primary system among pro-democracy candi-
dates threatened an em barrass ing defeat for pro-Beijing candidates, the Chi-
nese government ripped up the one-count ry-two-systems arrangement, imposed 
a draconian “national security” law that effectively ended the territory’s political 
freedoms, and allowed only “patriots” (meaning pro-Beijing candidates) to run 
for office. The Bangladeshi government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina jailed, 
5HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHforcibly disappeared, and executed members of the political opposition, and de-
ployed security forces to intimidate voters and candidates. 
In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega imprisoned all leading opponents and 
dozens of government critics and revoked the legal status of the main opposition parties. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko did the same with his main opponents but did not count on the enormous electoral appeal of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who replaced her husband as a candidate and may have won the stolen election before having to flee the country.  
In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni, facing a young, charismatic, and popular 
opponent, banned his rallies, and security fo rces shot his supporters. Iran’s rul-
ing clerics disqualified all but hardliners from competing in presidential elec-tions. Uzbekistan's leadership refused to  register any opposition parties, 
ensuring that there would be no genuine challenge to President Shavkat Mirziy-oyev's continued rule. The Cambodian and Thai governments dissolved popular opposition parties and forced oppos ition politicians into exile or prison. 
What is left after such blatant undermining of elections is no longer managed 
democracy but “zombie democracy”—the walking dead of democracy, a charade that has no pretense of a free and fair contest. These auto crats have moved from 
manipulated co-option to rule by repression and fear. Some cite this unabashed oppression as evidence of rising autocratic p ower, but in fact it often represents 
the opposite—an act of desperation by dict atorial leaders who know they have 
lost any prospect of popular support.  They apparently hope their pretense will be 
less provocative than overt rejection of democracy, but the cost is the loss of any legitimacy that they hoped to secure from the veneer of an electoral exercise.  
Beijing’s Quest for International Approval 
The Chinese government offers a vari ation on this theme. On the mainland, it 
has never counten anced elections. The cons titution imposes the dict atorship of 
the Chinese Communi st Party, and in recent years  the gov ernment incr easingly  
has asserted the alleged su periority of its  system over the me ssiness of  democ-
racy. Yet the government goes to great leng ths to avoid testing that proposition.  
In international forums such as the United Nations Human Rights Council, Chi-
nese officials trumpet as a sufficient measure of human rights the growth of its WORLD REPORT 2022
6gross domestic product. Predictably, they fight any effort to assess their record 
on civil and political rights, such as their detention of one mi llion Uyghu r and 
other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang to force them to abandon their religion, culture, and language. But they also reject any criticism of their economic and social policies that flags unequal rights or discrimination.  
To avoid such scrutiny, Beijing deploys a range of carrots and sticks in its foreign 
relations. The carrots include the one-trillion-do llar Belt and Road Initiative, os-
tensibly an infrastructure development program that promotes a Beijing-led 
“common destiny” but one so opaque that it  lends itself to corrupt leaders si-
phoning off funds while leaving their people stuck with unsustainable debts. The sticks were evident in the economic ret aliation that Beijing imposed on Australia 
for having the audacity to seek an independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, or Beijing’s threat to withhold Covi d vaccines from Ukraine unless its govern-
ment withdrew from a joint governmental statement at the UN Human Rights Council criticizing persecution in Xinji ang. Whether by cutting off countries or 
companies from access to the Chinese m arket or threatening members of the 
Chinese diaspora or their families back  home, Beijing now routinely extends its 
censorship efforts to critics abroad.  
Beijing especially does not want to subject  itself to the unfettered scrutiny of 
people across China, which is why it c ensors (and often detains) domestic crit-
ics. When the one territor y under its control  that was free to exp ress itself—Hong 
Kong—demons trated thr ough mass protests its opposition to C ommunist Party 
rule, Beijing crushed those freedoms. Similar fe ar of a domestic verdict on their 
rule can be seen in other dictatorial and monarchial governments that have never risked even “managed” elections, such as Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Eswatini, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.  
Power at Any Price 
In the ultimate logic of autocratic rule, some autocrats are so determined to cling 
to power that they are willing to risk humanitarian catastrophe. Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad epitomizes this callous calculation, having gone so far as to bomb (with Russian help) hospitals, school s, markets, and apartment buildings 
in areas held by the armed oppos ition, leaving parts of the country devastated 
and depopulated. V enezuela’s  Nicolas M aduro has similarly  presided  over the 
7HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHruination of his country—hyperinflation, a destroyed economy, and millions of 
people fleeing.  
Myanmar’s junta and the Taliban in Afghanistan seem to display a similar disre-
gard for public welfare, as did the Ethiopian government in pursuing a conflict 
that began in the Tigray region and the Sudanese military even though it has now made a pretense of return to sharing the government with those seeking 
democracy. Hoped-for bailouts from opponents of democracy— China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates—r arely suffice to salvage the autocrat 
from such me-over-the people destruction.  
In short, the autocrats’ alleged rise is more qualified than often assumed. 
Whether they face people in the streets seeking democracy, broad political coali-tions that resist their attacks on democracy, or the difficulty of controlling elec-tions when people see through their self-serv ing rule, autocrats are often 
running scared. The hoopla about the rise of autocrats aside, theirs is not an en-viable position. 
Democracies Falling Short 
Yet democracies today hardly have a stellar record in addressing societal ills. It is widely understood that, ultimately, democracies rise or fall by the power of their example, but too often that examp le has been disappointing. To day’s demo-
cratic leaders are not rising to the challenges facing the world. 
Yes, demo cracies are messy by their na ture. The d ivision of power inevitab ly 
slows its exercise, but that is the price of avoiding tyranny—a concern that espe-cially permeates the US system of government. However, democracies these days are failing in ways that transcend the inherent limitations of democratic checks and balances. That dis appointing performance comes even though the 
pluralism of democraci es—their free media, vi brant civil soc ieties, and inde-
pendent legislatures and courts—often exerts pressure on governments to ad-dress serious problems. 
The climate cr isis poses a dire threat, yet democratic le aders are only  nibbling at 
the problem, seemingly incapable of overcoming national perspectives and vested interests to take the major steps needed. Democracies responded to the pandemic by developing highly effective mRNA vaccines with remarkable speed, 
but they have failed to ensure that the people of lower-income countries share WORLD REPORT 2022
8this life-sav ing invention, resulting in co untless needless deaths  and inc reasing 
the likelihood of variants circumventing the vaccines.  
Some democratic governments took steps to mitigate the economic conse-
quences of the lockdowns used to pr otect people’s health and curb the spread 
of Covid-19 but have yet to tackle the broader and persistent problem of wide-spread poverty and inequality or to buil d adequate systems of social protection 
for the next inevitable economic disru ption. Democracies regularly debate the 
threats posed by technology—the dissemin ation of hatred and disinformation by 
social-media pl atforms, the large-scale invasion of our pr ivacy as an ec onomic 
model, the intru siveness of new surv eillance tools, the biases of artificia l intelli-
gence—but have taken only baby steps to address them.  
Yes, these problems are large, but as the climate debate shows, the bigger the 
problem, the more ev ident it is th at every go vernment has a responsibi lity to 
contribute to the solution. That recognition provides an opportunity for greater accountability, but many democratic leaders still hope to get by with soft com-mitments to which no one will hold them. Their caution is hardly a recipe for ef-fectiveness.  
These democracies fare no better when acting outside their borders. When they 
should be consistently backing democr ats over autocrats, they frequently de-
scend to the compromises of re alpolitik, in which bolstering autocratic 
“friends”—to curtail migration, fight terrorism, or prot ect supposed “stability”—
takes precedence over the principled defense of democracy. Egypt’s Sisi and Uganda’s Museveni have been prominent beneficiaries of this misguided logic.  
Similar rationalization—in this case, co untering the Chinese government—lies 
behind the general  silence among democratic  leaders that has greet ed Modi’s 
increasingly autocratic rule in India. The United States, the European Union, the 
United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia sought  to strengthen ties with India on 
security, technology, and trade with only vague mentions of “shared democratic values” and no willingness to hold the Modi government to account for the re-
pression of civi l society and the failure to protect  religious minoritie s from at-
tacks.  
9HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHBiden’s Mixed Signals 
In contrast to Tru mp’s embr ace of friend ly autocrats  when he was US p resident, 
Biden took office promising a foreign policy that would be guided by human rights. But he continued to sell arms to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emi-rates, and Israel despite their persistent repression. In the face of an autocratic 
trend in Central America, Biden mainly addressed the issue in traditional rival Nicaragua while elsewhere prioritizing efforts to curtail migration rather than au-
tocracy. A preoccupation with migration also led Biden to tread softly with Mexi-can President Andrés Manuel López Obrador despite his attacks on the media and judiciary and his Covid denialism. 
During key summits, Biden seemed to lose his voice when it came to public de-
nunciation of  serious human rights  violations. The US Stat e Department  has is-
sued occasional protests about repre ssion in certain countries, and in extreme 
cases the Biden administration introduced targeted sanctions on some officials 
responsible, but the influenti al voice of  the president  was oft en miss ing. After 
meeting with China’s Xi, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and Turkey’s Erdoğan, Biden noted that they had discussed “hum an rights” but offered few specifics about 
what was said or what consequenc es might ensue if repress ion continued. The 
people of those countries—the primary agents of change, who could have used a boost in these difficult times—were left uncertain about the backing they had re-ceived. 
Biden’s embr ace of intern ational instit utions has also been selective, ev en if it 
was a c onsiderab le improvement over Trump’s  attacks on them. Under Biden, 
the US government successfully ran for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council which Trump had abandoned, rejoined the World Health Organization after Trump moved to quit it, and re-committ ed to the global fight against climate

In addition, Biden lifted Trump’s sanctions against the International Criminal 
Court prosecutor. But he maintained  the US government’s opposition to the 
prosecutor investigating US torture in Afghanistan or Israeli war crimes and 
crimes against humanity in the Occupied  Palestinian Territory, even though both 
Afghanistan and Palestine have conferr ed jurisdiction to the court for crimes 
committed on their soil, and neither the US nor the Is raeli go vernment has con-
scientiously prosecuted these crimes.  WORLD REPORT 2022
10European Selectivity 
Other Western leaders displayed similar weakness in their defense of democ-
racy. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government helped to orches-trate global condemnation of the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. But while holding the Eur opean Union presidency, Germany helped 
to promote an EU investment deal with China despite Beijing’s use of Uyghur forced labor. Rather than conditioning the deal on ending the forced labor, or even adopting the International Labour Organization treaty banning it, Merkel settled for Beijing promising to think about perhaps one day joining the treaty. It took the European Parliament to reject that abandonment of principle.  
The government of French President Emm anuel Macron also helped to coordi-
nate broad condemnation of  Beijing’s conduct in Xinjiang but was b lind to the 
abysmal rights situation in Egypt. Egyptians under Sisi are living through the worst repression in the country’s modern history, yet the French government con-tinues to sell it arms, and Macron even gave Sisi La Légion d’honneur, France’s highest award. Similarly, Macron announced an enormous arms sale to the United Arab Emirates despite its military’s  involvement in the countle ss unlawful 
attacks against civilians in Yemen, and he became the fi rst Western leader to 
meet with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, since the 2018 mur-der of the independent journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In addition, the French gov-ernment failed to address the operations of  the French energy giant Total in 
Myanmar despite revenue from its operations funding the junta’s crimes against humanity.   
The European Union sti ll has not acted  on its new power to  condition large-scale 
subsidies to Hungary and Poland on their autocratic leaders’ respect for democ-
racy, human rights, and the rule of  law. It has not even taken the step of finding 
those governments in “serious brea ch” of the values of the EU treaty after the 
scrutiny procedure for both countries was initiated u nder the EU’s Article 7 be-
cause of their attacks on democratic rule. As  the Polish government closed its 
border to asylu m seekers pass ing through Belarus, fears rose th at its  actions 
would become the EU’s latest excuse to ignore the government’s moves to un-dermine an independent judiciary and attack the rights of women and LGBT peo-ple. Without a course correction, the EU ri sks being diminished from a club of 
democracies to a mere trading bloc. 
11HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMore broadly, the requirement of unanimity in matters of European Union foreign 
policy was increasingly a bused by a few member states to  mute and  undermine 
a swift, principled, and firm collective EU response to crackdowns on democracy and human rights. However, in a positive move, a majority of EU members has decided to act together as “like-minded” sta tes. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high rep-
resentative f or foreign affairs, has also sh own a willingne ss to represent estab-
lished EU positions on his own authority without the signoff of all EU members. 
Global Inconsistency 
Outside of the West, governments have taken at least some action for democracy against overt military coups—the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the case of Myanmar, the African Union with regard to Sudan, Guinea, and Mali.  
But they have shown no comparable interest in addressing endemic rights 
abuses by longstanding autocratic leaders, such as those ruling in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand in Asia or Rw anda, Uganda, and Egypt in Africa. The Or-
ganization of American States has stood up  against the dictators hips of Maduro 
in Venezuela and  Ortega in Nicaragua bu t still gives a pass to the autocr atic ten-
dencies of Bolsonaro in Brazil and President Nayib Bukele in El Salvador. Sri Lanka faced little pressure to respect rights as the Rajapaksa brothers returned to office despite their history of presiding over war crimes.  
In the Middle East, authoritarian governments, especially Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates, provided financial and other support to prop up Sisi’s re-pressive  rule in Egypt, applauded  President Kais Saied’s power grab in Tu nisia, 
and continued to back Bahrain’s zero tolerance for dissent. Iran continued to back Syria’s Assad despite the crimes against humanity that he oversaw in put-ting down the rebellion against his rule. The UAE, Turkey, Russia, and Egypt all armed abu sive actors in Libya.  
Meanwhile, the Russian gov ernment promoted far-right politicians in Western 
democracies with the hope of discrediting those democracies and hence allevi-ating pressure on the Kremlin to respect the desire of Russians for greater democracy.  WORLD REPORT 2022
12UN Disappointment  
UN Secretary-General António Guterres sh owed slightly more willingness in the 
past year to criticize specific governments for their human rights violations rather than resort to general exhortations to respect rights that no particular gov-ernment feels any pressure to heed. Yet Guterres mentioned mainly weak gov-ernments that were already pariahs, such  as Myanmar’s junta after the military 
coup. Even after he secured a second term and no longer needed to worry about China’s veto of his aspirations, Guterres refused to publicly condemn the Chi-nese government’s crimes agains t humanity in Xinjiang.  
The UN high comm issioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, allowed her in-
ability to gain un fettered access to Xinjiang—a ccess that Beijing has not granted 
after years of negotiation and probably never will—to become an excuse to delay publication of a report on Xinjiang for more than three year s, using the remote 
monitoring on which Human Rights Watch and many others rely.  In early Decem-ber, her spokesperson said he hoped the assessment would be issued in the weeks to come. Pressure will then mount on the members of the UN Human Rights Council to address the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity.  
The Need to Rise to the Occasion 
The outcome of the high-stakes battle between autocracy and democracy re-
mains uncertain. Due to the tendency of unaccountable governments to deliver poorly for their people, the autocrats are on the defen sive as popul ar protests 
mount, broad pro-democracy political coalitions emerge, and mere managed elections, as opposed to electoral ch arades, prove unreliable.  
Yet despite democracy’s broad appeal, its fate depends in large part on the ac-
tions of democratic leaders. Will they addre ss the major challenges before us, el-
evate rather than debase public debate, and act consistently, both at home and 
abroad, with the democratic and human rights principles they claim to defend? Being the least bad system of governance may not be enough if public despair at democratic leaders’ failure to meet today’s challenges leads to public indiffer-ence about democracy. The defense of human rights requires not only curbing autocratic repression, but also improving democratic leadership.

Executions and Enforced Disappearances under the Taliban in AfghanistanHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Afghanistan 
After the Taliban takeover of the country in August, the protracted Afghanistan 
conflict abruptly gave way to an accelerating human rights and humanitarian cri-sis. The Taliban immediately rolled back women’s rights advances and media freedom—among the foremost achievements of the post-2001 reconstruction ef-fort. Most secondary schools for girls we re closed, and women were prohibited 
from working in most government jobs and  many other areas. The Taliban beat 
and detained journalists; many media outlets closed or drastically scaled back their reporting, partly because many journalists had fled the country. The new Taliban cabinet included no women and no ministers from outside the Taliban’s 
own ranks.  
In many cities, the Taliban searched for, threatened, and sometimes detained or 
executed former members of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), offi-
cials of the former government , or their family members. 
As the Taliban entered Kabul on August 15, thousands of people tried to flee the 
country, but chaos and violence at the airport impeded the evacuation of many at-risk Afghans.  
The Taliban victory propel led Afghani stan from hum anitarian cr isis to catastro-
phe, with millions of Afghans fa cing severe food insecurity due to 
lost income , 
cash shortages, and rising food costs . 
In the six months before the takeover, fighting between government forces and 
the Taliban caused a sharp rise  in civi lian casualties from imp rovised explosive 
devices (IEDs), mortars, and airstrikes. The Islamic State of Khorasan Province (the Afghan branch of the Islamic Stat e, known as ISKP) carried out attacks on 
schools and mosques, many targeting minority Hazara Shia.  
Unlawful Killings, Enforced Disappearances, Violations  
of Laws of War  
The United Nations reported that Taliban forces were responsible for nearly 40 
percent  of civi lian deaths and  injuries in the first six  months of 2021, although 
many incidents were unclaimed. Women and children comprised nearly half  of

of deadly bombings.  
Many attacks targeted Afgh anistan’s Hazara Shia community. On May 8 , three 
explosions at the Sayed al-Shuhada school in Kabul killed at leas t 85 civi lians, 
including 42 girls and 28 women, and injured over 200—the vast majority from the Hazara community. The att ack was uncl aimed but occurr ed in a predomi-
nantly Hazara neighborhood that ISKP had r epeatedly targeted. On October 8, a 
suicide bombing during Friday prayer at a Shia mosque in Kunduz killed 
at least 
72 people and injured over 140; the ISKP claimed responsibility. On March 4, 
gunmen fatally shot  seven Hazara laborers  at a plastics factory in Jalalabad.  
Taliban forces in several provinces carried out retaliatory killings of at least 
dozens of former officials and security  force personnel. After the Taliban took 
control of Malistan, Ghazni, in mid-July, they killed at least 19  security force per-
sonnel in their custody, along w ith a number of  civili ans. Advancing Taliban 
forces killed at least 44 former security force members  in Kandahar after the Tal-
iban captured Spin Boldak in July. All had surrendered to the Taliban. There were 
credible reports of detentions and killings in other provinces as well as Kabul.  
Both the Taliban and IS KP carried out tar geted killings of  civili ans, including gov-
ernment employees, journali sts, and religious leaders.  On January 17 , 2021, 
unidentified gunmen fatally shot two women judges  who worked for 
Afghanistan’s high court and wounded their driver. ISKP claimed responsibility for killing nine polio vaccinators  in Nangarhar between March and June. 
On June 
9, gunmen killed 10 humanitarian deminers in Baghlan; ISKP claimed responsi-bility. 
In August, a n ISKP suicide bombing at Kabu l’s airport killed  170 civili ans, 
including many Afghans trying to flee the country.  
Taliban forces also forcibly evicted  people from their homes in a number of 
provinces including Daykundi, Uruzgan, Kunduz, and Kandahar, in apparent re-taliation for the residents’ perceived suppor t for the former government. In the 
largest of these expulsions, in September, 
hundreds of Hazara families  from the 
Gizab district of Uruzgan province and neighboring districts of Daykundi province were forced to abandon their homes and flee. 
Both the Taliban and Afghan government security forces were responsible for 
killing and inju ring civilians in indiscrimin ate mortar and rock et attac ks, and 
19HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcivili an casualties from the former gov ernment forces’ airstrikes more than dou-
bled  in the first half of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020. In one inci-
dent, on January 10, an airst rike in Nimroz killed  18 civi lians, including seven 
girls, six  women, and four boys; tw o civi lian men were injured. 
On August 15, as the Taliban entered Kabul, a strike force unit from the former 
government’s National Directorate of Security captured and executed 12 former 
prisoners who had just been released, according to witnesses.  
On August 29, the US launched a drone strike  on a car it cl aimed was filled with 
explosives headed  for Kabul’s airport. The car was actually driv en by an NGO em-
ployee scheduled for evacuation to the US. Two weeks later the US Defense De-
partment admitted the strike had been a “ tragic mistake ,” killing 10 civi lians, 
including seven children. 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
In the weeks after the Taliban take over, Taliban authorities announced a steady 
stream of policies  and regulations rolling back  women’s and girls’ rights. These 
included measures severely curtailing access to employment and education and 
restricting the right to peaceful assembly. The Taliban also searched out high-profile women and denied them freedom of movement outside their homes. 
The Taliban 
have said  they support education for girls and women, but on Sep-
tember 18 they ordered secondary schools to reopen  only for boys. Some sec-
ondary schools for girls subsequently reopened  in a few provinces, but as of 
October the vast majority remained shut. On August 29, the acting minister  of 
higher education announced that girls and women could participate in higher education but could not study with boys and men. A lack of female teachers, es-
pecially in higher education, likely means this policy will lead to de facto denial of access to education for many girls and women.  
Women who had taught boys in class es above sixth gr ade or men in mixed 
classes at university 
have been dismissed  in some ar eas bec ause teaching 
males is no longer allowed. In many parts of Afghanistan, Taliban officials have banned or restricted female humanitarian w orkers—a move that could likely 
worsen access to health care and humanitarian aid. The Taliban have also 
dis-
missed  almost all female government emplo yees. In September, the Taliban’s

women’s return to w ork was “postponed” until it  prepared a “mechanism for 
how they will work.” When women have been allowed to return to work, they have faced requirements for gender segregation in their workplaces. 
In September, the Taliban 
eliminated  the Ministry for Women’s Affairs and repur-
posed its building as the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of 
Vice, an institution mandated to enfor ce rules on citizens’ behavior, including 
how women dress, and when or whether women can move outside the home un-accompanied by a male relative. The 
shelters  that had been established for 
women fleeing violence have been closed, and some the women who lived in them have been transferred to women’s prisons.  
Freedom of Media, Speech, and Assembly   
The Afghan media came under growing threat since the beginning of the year, principally from the Taliban. The ISKP also c arried out a number of deadly attacks 
on journalists. 
On December 21, 2020, Rahmatullah Nekzad, head of the Ghazni journalists’ 
union, 
was fatally shot  as he walked from his home to a local mosque. Although 
the Taliban denied  responsibility, Nekzad had previously received threats from 
local Taliban commanders.   
The ISKP took responsibility for killing Malala Maiwand , a TV presenter for 
Enikass News in Jalalabad , along with her driver, Ta har Khan, on December 10, 
2020. In two separate attacks in Jalalabad on March 2, 2021 , gunmen fatally 
shot three w omen who worked at Enikass News dubb ing foreign language news 
reports. 
After the Taliban takeover, nearly 70 percent  of all Afghan media outlets closed, 
and others were operating under threat and self-censoring. In September, the Taliban authorities imposed 
wide-ranging restrictions  on media and free speech 
that included prohibitions on “insulting nation al figures” and reports that could 
have a “negative impact on the public’s attitude.” On September 7 , Taliban secu-rity forces 
detained  two journalists from the Etilaat-e Roz media outlet and se-
verely beat  them in custody befor e releas ing them. The reporters had been 
22WORLD REPORT 2022covering protests by women in Kabul. The Taliban detained at least 32  journalists 
after taking power in Kabul. 
Beginning on September 2, Afghan women carried out demonstrations in several 
cities to protest against Taliban po licies violating women’s rights. In Herat, Tal-
iban fighters lashed protesters and fired  weapons indiscriminately to disperse 
the crowd,  killing  two men and wounding at least eight more. The Taliban subse-
quently  banned  protests that did not have prior approval from the Justice Min-
istry in Kabul. Some protests nevertheless continued. 
On July 6, the f ormer Afghan go vernment annou nced it was  unlawful  to broad-
cast news “against the national interest.” On July 26, four journalists  were ar-
rested  by the former government’s intelligence agency  after they returned from 
Spin Boldak, Kandahar , where they had been  investigating  the Taliban’s 
takeover of the district. They were not released until after Kandahar fell to the Taliban on August 13.  
International Justice and Investigations into Abuses  
On September 27 , the prosecut or for the International Criminal Court filed an ap-
plication before the court’s judges seek ing authorization to resume an investiga-
tion in Afghanistan following the colla pse of the former Afghan government. 
Prosecutor Karim Khan stated, however, th at his investigation would focus only 
on crimes allegedly committed by the T aliban and the Islamic State and depriori-
tize other aspects of the investigation, namely alleged crimes committed by the 
forces of the former Afghan government and US military and CIA personnel.  
On August 24, the UN Human Rights Council held a special session , requested 
jointly by Afghanistan and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), but the negotiations—led by Pakistan as OIC coordinator —failed to create any new moni-
toring mechanism. At its next regular session, the 
UN Human Rights Council  
adopted on October 7 a European Union-led resolution  establishing a special 
rapporteur on Afghanistan, supported by experts, including on “fact-finding, forensics, and the rights of women and girls.” 
In June, Afghan witnesses testified by video link in the defamation trial against 
Australian newspapers brought by f ormer Australian SAS officer Ben Roberts-
Smith. In 2018, The Age , Sydney Morning Herald,  and Canberra Times  had 
pub-
23HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHlished accounts  of alleged ki llings of civili ans and other abus es by SA S units, 
and by Roberts-Smith himself. Those abuses are being examined by Australian investigators. 
Key International Actors   
On April 14, US President Joe Biden announced  a full US troop withdrawal from 
Afghanistan. The expedited withdrawal did not include plans for evacuating 
many Afghans who had worked for the US and NATO forces or for programs spon-
sored by donor countries.  
Canada, the EU, United Kingdom, United States, and other countries evacuated  
several hundred thousand Afghans who had worked directly with those govern-
ments, their military forces, or organizations  they supported. Thousands more 
Afghans remained at risk—including h uman rights defenders, women’s rights ac-
tivis ts, journalists, and  lesbian, gay, bisexual , and transgender people—with no 
way of exiting the country safely . Although EU members evacuated some 
Afghans, as of November, none had made commitments  to take in more 
refugees. Member states pledged one billion euros in humanitarian aid. 
After the Taliban takeover, the New York Federal Reserve  cut off  the Afghanistan 
Central Bank’s access to its US dollar assets. The International Monetary Fund 
prevented  Afghanistan from accessing funding including Special Drawing Rights. 
In August, donors stopped payments from the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Re construction Trust Fund, previously used to pay civi l servants’ 
salaries, accelerating Afghanistan’s economic collapse.  
In September, the UN Security Council authorized a six-month renewal of the UN 
Assistance Miss ion in Afghani stan (UNAMA). The fu ture of the miss ion, which 
among other things is mandated to promot e the rights of Afghan women and 
girls and to monitor, investigate, and r eport on alleged human rights abuses, is 
uncertain. UN Secretary-General António Guterres is expected to make recom-mendations to the council in early 2022 on UNAMA’s future. 
As of November, the Taliban government had not been formally recognized by 
any other country. In September, the EU 
set five benchmarks  for engagement 
with the Taliban government, among them, res pect for human rights, in particu-
lar those of w omen and girls, and  establis hing an inclu sive and representative 
government. 
24WORLD REPORT 2022At the G20 meeting on September 23, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for 
an end to all economic sanctions on Afghanistan, said that China expected the Taliban government  to eventual ly become more inc lusive, and cal led on the Tal-
iban to “resolutely” fight international terrorism. 
As of November 1, Russia, Turkey, and Iran 
stated  they would not acknowledge a 
Taliban-led go vernment until they formed  an “inclu sive” administration. Russia 
invited Taliban  representative s to international  talks on Afghanist an in Moscow 
on October 20.  
While Pakistan stopped short of recognizing the Taliban government, it called for 
greater international engagement with the Taliban, while also urging them to cre-
ate a more “ inclusive ” government. 
Throughout the year, the deteriorating si tuation in Afgh anistan was repeatedly 
addressed  by UN special procedures, treaty bodies, and the UN High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights. 
 
25HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAlgeria 
After a wide crackdown in 2020 on the “Hir ak,” a pro-reform protest movement 
that pushed President Abdelaziz Boutefli ka to resign in April 2019, Algerian au-
thorities widened the scope of the repression in 2021 to include Islamists and 
activis ts for the autonomy of the Kabylie region. Scores of pr otesters, politicians, 
human rights defenders, and journalists were arrested and prosecuted, some sentenced to years in prison, often on s peech-related char ges, while political 
parties were shut down. More than 2 30 individuals were being held in prison be-
cause of their peaceful speech or act ivism as of Nove mber, according to a group 
monitoring arrests. The government labelled  a loosely defined  pro-autonomy 
movement in the Kabylie region and an Isl amist group as “terrorist organiza-
tions,” and arrested sev eral indiv iduals, including human rights  activis ts and a 
lawyer, under the accusation of being connected to those groups.  
Political Rights and Freedom of Association  
The months preceding the legislative elections held on June 12 saw a marked in-
crease in arrests and prosecutions for speech offense s in Algeria. 
Up until the election, in an apparent attempt to  disrupt the weekly Hirak demon-
strations, security forces habitually rounded  up large numbers of protesters, re-
leasing most by the end of the day without bringing them to trial. 
On May 18, the High Security Council, an official body headed by President Ab-
delmadjid Tebboune, labelled  two political movements, the Islamist opposition 
group Rachad and the Movement f or the Self-Determination of the Kabylie region 
(MAK) as “terrorist organizations.”  
The MAK, created in 2001, describes itself as a movement seeking autonomy 
from Algiers as a prelude to founding an independent state in Kabylie “through 
peaceful means” and denies  any involvement in violent activities. Rachad, an Is-
lamist oppos ition party, was founded  in 2007 and claims  to “rely on non-vio-
lence and peacefulness in any political or social change.” 
On June 8, after he dissolved parliament  and called new elections, President 
Tebboune amended the penal code by presidential decree , expanding Algeria’s 
26WORLD REPORT 2022already overbroad definition of terrorism to include “any act targeting state se-
curity, national unity, or the stability and normal functioning of institutions that aims to ... work toward or incite, by any means whatsoever, gaining power or 
changing the system of governance by non-constitutional means,” or “under-mine the integrity of the national territor y or incite [others] to do so, by any 
means whatsoever.” Among other concerns, the law could be used to target non-violent protesters and political oppo sition groups seeking changes to the gov-
ernment.   
On April 23, police arrested university scholar and human rights defender Kad-
dour Chouicha, and the journalists and human rights  activis ts Jamila Loukil 
(Chouicha’s wife) and Said Boudour, in Oran. A tribunal in that city later charged 
them with “conspiring against State security, inciting citizens to take up arms against authorities, propag anda of foreign origin or inspiration likely to harm na-
tional interest, and enlistment in a t errorist organization.” Amnesty International 
dismissed the charges as “
trumped up .” 
According to an account by Frontline Defenders , as Chouicha and Boudour left 
the court on April 28, police rear rested them and ques tioned them about their 
human rights work and their alleged invo lvement with Islamist groups, “which 
they categorically denied.” As time of writing, Chouicha, Boudour, and Loukil were provisionally free and awaiting trial. 
On April 4, police 
arrested  Mohamed Tadjadit and Malik Riahi in Algiers, then 
Tarek Debaghi, Soheib Debaghi, and Nour eddine Khimoud the next day in Batna, 
500 kilometers from Algiers. The five men, all Hirak mem bers, were arrested in 
connection to a YouTube video  posted on April 3, in which some of them ap-
peared to conso le a boy who said he was 15 years old and ha d just been sexually 
molested by police agents after they arrested him during a protest.  A prosecutor 
in Algiers said the al legation of sex ual molestation of the boy was unfounded , 
and later accused the five protesters of “forming a criminal association, spread-ing false news, drug posse ssion, broadcasting images that can harm a minor, 
and incitement of a minor to debauchery.” The five men were still in pretrial de-
tention at time of writing. Tadjadid, also known as “
the poet of the Hirak ” for his 
recitation of his own protest poems befor e crowds of protesters, had been in and 
out of prison since the beginning of the protests. 
In May, the Ministry of Interior petitioned courts to “suspend” two small political 
parties, the Union for Change and Progress ( UCP ) and the Socialist Workers Party 
27HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH(PST,) on the grounds that they had not completed their legal registration re-
quirements. The same month, the ministry also petitioned  to dissolve the Youth 
Action Rally (RAJ), a civil soc iety org anization whose pres ident, Abdelouahab 
Fersaoui, had spent seven months in prison between October 2019 and May 2020 for “harming the integrity of the national  territory” after he criticized gov-
ernment policies on Facebook. The petition said that RAJ had engaged in activi-ties “different from those it was cr eated for,” including “ suspicious activities 
with foreigners” and activities “of a politic al nature for the purpose of creating 
chaos and disturbing the public order.” The tribunal ordered RAJ dissolved on 
October 13. 
On June 30, Fethi Ghares, the leader of Democratic and Social Movement (MDS) 
opposition party, was arrested in A lgiers. A prosecutor ch arged him with “insult-
ing the president of the republic” and “disseminating information that could harm national interest and undermine public order.” An investigative judge re-manded him in custody pending investigation, for “
insulting President Teb-
boune .” He remained in pretrial detention at time of writing. 
On August 24, Karima Nait Sid, the co-president of the World Amazigh Congress, 
an association pr omoting the rights of the Amazigh ethnic  group, was det ained 
incommunicado in an unknown location for three days, according to Frontline 
Defenders . She resurfaced on September 1 befor e a prosecutor in Algiers, who 
charged her with “undermining state security and belonging to a terrorist organi-
zation,” apparently in refer ence to MAK. She was det ained in a pri son in Tipaza 
awaiting trial at time of writing.  
On August 25, Slim ane Bouhafs, an Am azigh act ivist and Christi an convert who 
spent two years in prison between 2016 and 2018 for “offending the prophet of 
Islam” and was registered as a re fugee with the Unit ed Nations in Tu nisia in 
2020, went missing from his home in Tunis. His whereabouts were unknown until September 1, when he appeared in a cour t in Algiers. A relative of Bouhafs 
told Human Rights Watch that witnesses who lived in the same building in Tunis saw three unidentified men carrying a seemingly unconscious Bouhafs out of the building and into a waiting car. Kader Houali, Bouhafs’ lawyer, said his client 
had been charged on six counts, including endangering the security of the state, 
call to public disturbance, and terrori sm offenses.  At time of writing, Bouhafs re-
mained in detention awaiting trial. 
28WORLD REPORT 2022On September 14, the police arreste d journalist and prominent Hirak figure Fodil 
Boumala. Two days later, an investig ative judge in Algiers opened an investiga-
tion into accusations of “disseminating false statements published on Boumala’s Facebook account and undermining national unity,” 
according to his 
lawyer . Boumala remained in pretrial detention at time of writing. He had been 
arrested twice and spent more than five months in prison since Hirak protests 
began in 2019.   
The National Committee for the Liberation of  Detainees, a group tracking politi-
cal detainees, in November listed  231 persons, including Hirak protesters, 
human rights defender s, journalists, politicians and civil soc iety act ivists as  be-
hind bars for expressing dissent. 
Freedom of Speech 
On April 22, a court in Algiers sentenced  religion scholar Saïd Djabelkhir to three 
years in prison for “offending the Prophet  of Islam” and “denigrating the dogma 
or precepts of Islam,” after private citiz ens complained about his critical writings 
on Islam. 
On May 14, the police arrested Radio M journ alist Kenza Khatto and kept her in 
detention for five days. On June 1, she appeared u nder provis ional rel ease be-
fore a judge in Algiers who sentenced her to three months of suspended prison 
for “participation in an unarmed gathering” and “dissemination of news that could undermine national unity” for no apparent motive other than her 
coverage 
of the Hirak protests . 
On May 18, Radio M’s  director Ihsane El Kadi was pl aced under judic ial control 
for “undermining national unity” and “publications that harm the national inter-est,” after publishing an article criticizing the labelling of Rachad and MAK as terrorist gr oups. The judicial supervis ion of El Kadi involved sev eral restrictions, 
including the obligation to report a police station weekly, the confiscation of his passport, and r equiring the perm ission of local authorities for him to leave the 
governorate of Algiers. 
On June 13, the Ministry of Communication withdrew the accreditation of the 
French TV 
France 24 , citing unspecified “breaches of ethics” and the channel’s 
“manifestly hostile agenda against Algeri a.” Two weeks later, authorities with-
29HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHdrew the accreditation of Saudi TV channel Al-Arabiya  under unspecified accusa-
tions of “propagating misinformation and practicing media manipulation.” Unac-credited foreign TV channels are not allowe d to cover press conferences, film in 
the street, set up live broadcasts, or conduct much of their routine activities. 
Most of foreign TV channels operating in Algeria work in a legal limbo most of the 
time due to the dela ys in obt aining one -year accr editations. According to the 
local branch of Reporters Without Border s, most foreign channels as of October 
1, 2021, had not been accredited yet for 2021. 
On June 26, authorities arreste d former MP Nordine Ait Hamouda in Bejaia, then 
transferred him to Algiers the next day  and remanded him in custody pending in-
vestigation for “insulting symbols of the state,” and “attacking a former Presi-
dent of the Republic.” The charges pertain to 
comments  Ait Hamouda made on 
the privately-owned local Al Hayat TV channel a few days earlier calling historic 
figures including Emir Abdelkader and Houari Boumediene “traitors.” For the same reason, the Ministry of Communication ordered on June 23 a one-week suspension of Al  Hayat TV. Ait Hamoud a was 
granted provisional release  on Au-
gust 23 after two months in El Harrach prison in Algiers. His trial is still pending. 
On August 12, journalist Rabah Kareche, the correspondent of the newspaper 
Liberté in the southern city  of Tamanrasset, was sentenced  to one year in prison, 
including eight months suspended, for “undermining national security, national unity and public order via the deliber ate dissemination of false information.” 
Kareche had been in pretrial detention sinc e April 18. The day before his arrest, 
policemen had interrogat ed him in a police station in Ta manasset 
about  his cov-
erage of a local  protest against revis ions in dist rict boundarie s. Karec he was re-
leased on October 19. 
On September 13, authorities ar rested Mohamed Mouloudj, and later charged 
him with “spreading false news, harming national unity and  belonging to a ter-
rorist group,” the latter charge in reference to the MAK movement. After an in-
vestigative judge in Algiers questioned Mouloudj on his contacts with MAK 
founder Ferhat Mehenni, Mouloudj answered  that the contacts were part of his 
journalistic work. The judge placed him in pretrial detention, where he remained 
at the time of writing. 
30WORLD REPORT 2022Judicial Independence  
On May 30, the High Council of Magistracy (HCM), an official body presided by 
the president of the Republic, dismissed judge Sadedine Merzoug, spokesper-son of the Free Magistrates Club, an un-recognized independent organization 
founded in 2016 . The reason the HCM p rovided for firing Merz oug was that he 
“violated his obligation of confidentiality” by posting multiple pro-Hirak state-
ments on Facebook. The French daily Le Monde 
wrote  that Merzoug’s explicit 
support of the Hirak earned him been five disciplinary sanctions since the Hirak started in 2019.  
Migrants, Asylum Seekers, and Refugees 
Algerian authorities continued co llective expulsions to Niger and Mali of thou-
sands of migrants, including hundreds of  children, often without individual 
screenings or due process. Migrants reported cases of violence, theft of their be-
longings, arbitrary detention, detention of ch ildren with adults, poor treatment 
in detention, and other mistreatment by Algerian authorities during arrests, de-
tention, and expulsions to  land borders. Between January and July, Algerian au-
thorities expelled 13,602 people to Niger, including 8,858 Nigeriens, according 
to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR); as of October, Alarm Phone Sahara in Niger reported that 
over 18,000  people had been expelled. 
Authorities forcibly repatriated most Nigeriens in truck convoys per a 2014 bilat-
eral oral agreement , while they left others of over 20 nationalities, mostly Sub-
Saharan Africans, in the desert at the Niger border. Those expelled included at 
least 51  asylum seekers or other “persons of concern” to UNHCR, in violation of 
the principle of non-refoulement u nder international refugee law. 
Though a party to the African and UN refugee conventions, Algeria continued to 
lack a national asylum law and protection framework. Ref ugees and asylum 
seekers had free access to public education and primary healthcare, but admin-istrative barriers hindered their access to school and work. According to UNHCR, 
the government said it would include refugees in its national Covid-19 vaccina-tion plan, and vaccinations for Sahrawi refugees began in May 2021. 
31HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen’s Rights  
Article 326 of the penal code, a colonial-er a relic, allows a person who abducts a 
minor to escape prosecution if he marries his victim. 
Algeria’s Family Code allows men to have a unilateral divorce without explana-
tion but requires women to apply to courts  for a divorce on specified grounds. 
Feminicides Algerie  report ed that some 38 women and girls were killed in 2021, 
including 33  reported to have been ki lled by their husbands, former husbands, 
fathers, brothers, sons or another family member. Although, a 2015 
law made assault on a spouse punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a life sentence for injuries resulting in death, the law does not set out any further mea-
sures to prev ent abuse or adequat ely protect su rvivor s, such as protection or-
ders.   
The penal code does not explicitly criminaliz e corporal punishment of children; 
surveys have found more than 85 per cent experience violent discipline in the 
home. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Same-sex relations are punishable under article 338 of the penal code  by up to 
two years in prison and adultery is punishable under article 339 of the penal code with one to two years imprisonment. Restrictions on freedom of association also pose obstacles to the work of l esbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
groups.  
According to a global survey on “state-sanctioned homophobia”, published in 
2017 , an Algerian law that prohibits the registration of organizations whose aims 
are inconsistent with “public morals,” and which prescribes criminal penalties for members of unregistered organizations, po ses risks to LGBT groups, as well 
as to human rights organizations that otherwise might support them.
32WORLD REPORT 2022Angola 
The human rights situation in Angola achieved one key improvement in 2021 
with the entry into force of the new penal code. The code decriminalizes same-sex conduct, protects the rights of childr en in conflict with the law, criminalizes 
genital mutil ation and sex ual harass ment, and expands the ci rcumstanc es under 
which abortion is legally permitted. However, the government  has m ade little 
progress on broader human rights issues. Stat e security forces were implicated 
in serious human rights abus es, including summary exec utions, exce ssive u se of 
force against peaceful protesters, and arbitrary det entions. Authorities also used 
draconian media laws to limit the work of jo urnalists. Cases of sexual abuse of 
children continued to increase. Several provinces in southern Angola faced the worst drought in 40 years, causing over 1.3 million people to face hunger, with many crossing the border into Namibia in search of food.  
 
Humanitarian Crisis in the Southern Region 
Southern Angola faced the worst drought sinc e 1981, which severely affected ac-
cess to food in three provinces. The World Food Program (WFP) said that more 
than 1.3 million people  in Cunene, Huila, and Namibe provinces faced severe 
hunger. Of those, 114,000 were children under the age of 5, who were suffering or likely to suffer from acute malnutrition. In March, the Namibian press 
reported  
that hundreds of Angolans fleeing the drought had crossed the border into 
Namibia in search of food.  
In July, a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Association Building 
Communities  (Associação Construindo Comunidades, ACC), called the situation 
“catastrophic,” and  urged the Angolan go vernment to declare a state of emer-
gency in the region. Du ring a September visit of the Angolan Pres ident Joao 
Lourenço to the region, the governor of Cunene, Gerdina Didalelwa, said that the drought had caused a movement of  people “never seen before,” with 4,000 peo-
ple displaced within Cunene province and 2,000 to Namibia. In September, the Angolan government 
set up a task force  largely made up of officials from govern-
ment institutions to distribute humanitarian aid to victims of the drought. 
33HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAbuses by State Security Forces 
Angolan state security forces continued to be implicated in serious human rights 
abuses, including summary ex ecutions, exce ssive u se of force ag ainst peaceful 
protesters, and arbitrary detentions throughout 2021.  
On January 30, police killed  at least 10 protester s, when they indiscriminately 
fired at people who had peacefully gathered to demand better public services, such as water and electricity supply , in the diamond-rich town of Cafunfu, in 
Lunda Norte province. Following the violence, graphic video footage shared on social media showed uniformed Angolan police officers and soldiers walking 
among the dead and injured on a road, kicking and beating detainees. The An-golan police chief, Pau lo de Almeida, initially  rejected calls for 
an independent 
investigation  into alleged ex cessive u se of force against protesters, but the po-
lice department  laterannounced that two senior officers implicated in the vio-
lence had been dismissed. They were implicated in the mishandling of corpses and the mistreatment of detained pr otesters, including kicking and beatings. 
In February, the Angolan NGO 
Mosaiko  accused police of intimidating activists 
and religiou s missionaries in Lu nda Norte, after officers prevented  priests and 
Mosaiko act ivists fr om leaving their homes.    
Security forces continued to use force to  prevent peaceful protests. On Novem-
ber 11, 2020, Angola’s Independence Day, the police used live bullets, teargas, 
and dogs  to disperse a peaceful anti-government  protest, killing one protester in 
Luanda. In April, polic e used bullets  and teargas to  disperse a gr oup of students 
who took to the streets in Luanda, the Angolan capital, to protest the increase of 
school fees. In August, polic e used dogs and batons to disperse a group  of 
about 20 people who tried to protest in front of the parliament building in Lu-
anda. 
Children’s Rights 
Authorities struggled to protect the rights of ch ildren, as cases of sexual abuse 
of children continued to increase. In June, the National Children’s Institute , 
INAC, revealed  that over 4,000 children below age 14 had been sexually abused 
since June 2020. INAC said most of the victims were girls from Luanda, who were sexually abused by neighbors and family friends. Local children 
rights’  activists 
34WORLD REPORT 2022said official government numbers reflected on ly reported cases of sexual abuse. 
In many cases, abusers offer money to the f amily of the victim to convince it not 
to report such abuses or to close a criminal case. 
In September, the Ministry of Social Action , Family and Women’s Promotion dis-
closed the existence of a child p rostitution network in the fishing village of Ca-
hota, in Benguela province, allegedly controlled by Chinese migrants. Media reports had alleged that dozens of girls, some as young as 13, had become preg-
nant, and at least 17 girls had borne children to Chine se men, after being sexu-
ally abused. As of October, authorities 
had arrested  at least one man in 
connection with the case, and police inv estigations were still ongoing. The gov-
ernment did not  publicly di sclose what type of assistanc e, if any, it  had provided 
to the victims. 
Before the Covid-19 pandemic, 18  percent of Angolan children were out of pri-
mary school. After the pandemic’s start in 20 20, schools were closed for 195 
days, and partially open to certain ages or in certain areas, for 106 days, affect-ing 8.7 million children. In 2021, schools were partially closed in January and February, but open for the remainder of the year.  
Freedom of Media 
Authorities continued to u se draconian media l aws to repress and harass jour-
nalists. In June, journalists Coque Mukuta and Escrivão José were charged  with 
criminal defamation after two ruling party officials filed separate complaints 
about articles they published. The Committ ee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, re-
ported at least  six other  cases  of criminal defamation complaints against jour-
nalists in Angola since March. 
Millions of Angolans across the country ar e still denied access to free, diverse, 
and impartial information, as Angola remained  the only southern African country 
without community radio stations.  
Authorities reduced the n umber of private televis ion stations in Apri l, when the 
Ministry of Telecommunications, Information Technologies and Social Communi-cation 
announced  the suspension of  the licenses of three televis ion channels, 
resulting in the loss of hundreds of job s. The ministry said the media companies 
were operating under p rovisional regis trations and  would remain suspended 
35HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHuntil the regularization of their status. In Aug ust, Secretary of State for Social 
Communication Nuno Caldas Albina said that  the media companies would not 
be allowed to resume any time soon, despite at least two of them having submit-ted the required documentation.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
In a positive step, Angola’s new penal code, which came into force  on February 
10, no longer criminalizes consensual same- sex conduct. Parliament had passed 
the new legislation in January 2019 to replace the obsolete penal code of 1886, but the president did not sign it into law until November 2020.   
The new penal code r emoved the contentious provisions th at punis hed people 
who “habitually indulge in the practice of vices against nature,” which targeted 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, and limited their access to employment, health care, and education. The new law prohibits violence and 
discrimin ation on the b asis of se xual orient ation among other things, including 
for employment, with a punishment of up to two years’ imprisonment.
 
Key International Actors  
Angola continued its efforts  in conflict resolution and peace building across cen-
tral Africa, playing leading roles in the Economic Community of Central African States, ECCAS, and the International C onference on the Great Lakes Region, 
ICGLR. 
On July 27 , Angola’s parliament 
approved  the deployment of 20 officers and a 
transport aircraft to Mozambique as part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) m ission in support of Mozamb ique’s militar y operations 
against armed Islamist groups in its northern Cabo Delgardo province. 
In September, following a meeting with Angol an President João Lourenço, United 
States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan 
reaffirmed his support  in resuming 
the US- Angola Strategic Dialogue as the cent erpiece of bilateral engagement be-
tween the countries.  
In his address  at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 
September, President Lourenço pushed for universal and open access to Covid-
36WORLD REPORT 202219 vaccines to “allow for wider pr oduction and equitable distribution on a global 
scale.” He also called on the international community to take “appropriate and 
sufficient action” to  discourage military coups in Africa, as was re cently experi-
enced in Mali and Guinea. 
 
37HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHArgentina 
Longstanding human rights problems in Argentina include police abuse, poor 
prison conditions, and endemic violence against women. In December 2020, Congress passed a landmark bill to legalize abortion up to the fourteenth week 
of pregnancy, ending a nearly century-old exception model that put the life and health of women at risk. However, implementation remains a challenge.  
Some government-promoted proposed legal reforms to  the justice system and 
the Attorney General’s Office pose a risk to their independence. Delays in ap-pointing permanent judges, likewise, undermine the justice system. Impunity for 
the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish cent er in Buenos Aires continues to be a 
concern. 
A legislative  election in November, which the opposition won, has modified the 
Senate’s composition, making it har der for the government coalition to pass 
laws without a meaningful debate. 
Confronting Past Abuses 
Pardons and amnesty laws  shielding officials implicated in the 1976-1983 dicta-
torship’s crimes were annulled by the Su preme Court and federal judges in the 
early 2000s. As of June 2021, the Attorney General’s Office reported 3,493 peo-ple charged, 1,030 convicted, and 159 acquitted. Of 631 investigations into 
crimes against hum anity, judges ha d issued ru lings in 256. 
As of August 2021, 130 people illegally  taken from their parents as children dur-
ing the dictatorship had been identified and many had been reunited with their families, according to the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group. 
The large number of victims, suspects, and cases of alleged crimes of the dicta-
torship makes it difficult for prosec utors and judges to bring those responsible 
to justice.  
The fate of Jorge Julio López, a torture victim who disappeared in 2006—a day 
before he was due to  attend the trial of  one of his tortur ers—remains unknown. 
38WORLD REPORT 2022Prison Conditions and Abuses by Security Forces 
The National Penitentiary Office reported 176 alleged cases of torture or ill-treat-
ment in federal prisons in 2020 and 77 from January through June 2021. The At-torney General’s Office reported 16 violent  deaths of people detained in federal 
prisons in 2020. 
Almost half of the 11,290 detainees in federal prisons have not been convicted of 
a crime but are awaiting trial, the gov ernment reports. Hundreds of people were 
conditionally  released by judic ial decisions in 20 20 to prevent the spread of the 
virus that causes Cov id-19, but no meaningful ref orm has been undertaken to ad-
dress pretrial detention. 
In February 2021, the National Penitentiary Office reported that 58 detainees had 
died in federal prisons in 2020—the highest figure in the last 10 years—17 report-edly from Covid-19. Between January and June 2021, the National Penitentiary Of-fice reported 16 deaths.  
Security forces  occasionally  employ excessive  force. In 2020 , the Ombudsper-
son’s Office reported 297 cases of  violence by security officers.  
The Ombudsperson’s Office reported abuses  by security forces enforcing the 
lockdown established to prevent the sp read of Covid-19. Prosecutors continued 
to investigate the killing and possible enforced disappearance of Facundo As-
tudillo Castro  and Luis Espinosa, two you ng men who went m issing in the con-
text of the national lockdown in 2020 and were later found dead.  
Authorities in Argentina’s  northern province of  Formosa employe d abusive and 
unsanitary measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, including holding people in “isolation” and “quarantine” c enters in circumstances that 
amounted to arbitrary detention. Authorities limited journali sts’ ability to report 
on the situation, al legedly used  excessive  force against people who protested 
the Covid-19 regulations, and  arrested and brought criminal charges against 
some. 
Freedom of Expression 
In February, a federal judge opened a crimin al investigation against a former di-
rector and deputy director of Argentina’s Federal  Intelligence Agency for leading 
39HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHa conspiracy for the illegal surveillance of journalists, union members, and 
politicians under the administration of former President Mauricio Macri. 
High level authorities, including President Alberto Fernández, have used hostile 
rhetoric against independent journalists, accusing them of spreading “fake news” when reporting on issues of public int erest, such as irregularities in the 
distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. 
A 2016 law created a national agency to ensure public access to government in-
formation and protect personal data. Fr om 2017 to August 2021, individuals had 
filed 20,660 information requests. Authoritie s responded to most within a 
month, the legal deadline. As of August 2021, citizens had filed 1,220 appeals, in most cases after authorities had failed to respond by the deadline. 
Some provinces and municipalities lack freedom of information laws, undermin-
ing transparency. 
Judicial Independence  
The Fernández  administration has been attempting to ov erhaul the country’s ju-
diciary. 
A “council of experts” appointed by President Fernández in August 2020 to pro-
pose reforms to the Magistrate’s Coun cil, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney 
General’s Office presented its report in December 2020. Recommendations in-cluded modifying the Magistrate’s Counci l’s structure and establishing a term 
limit for the attorney general, currently a lifetime appointment. Some of the 11 experts on the council had ties to officials under investigation, including the 
lawyer of Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, whose position grants her immunity from arrest on multiple corruption charges. 
In September 2020, the Senate passed a government-promoted bill creating 
dozens of new criminal courts to be staffed by temporary judges (pending ap-pointment of tenured judges). Previo usly, delays in appointing tenured judges 
often left temporary judges in place for years. The Supreme Court ruled in 2015 
that this undermined judicial independence. As of September 2021, 239 federal and national judgeships remained vacant. 
40WORLD REPORT 2022In November 2020, the Senate passed  another government-promot ed bill reduc-
ing the legislative majority needed to appoint an attorney general and establish-ing a term limit, in line with the council’s recommendation. 
The House of Representatives had not discussed either bill at time of writing. 
The Ombudsperson’s Office 
The Ombudsperson’s  Office, whic h is structura lly independent from the execu-
tive and has powe rs to document  and investig ate acts by the nation al govern-
ment, remains vacant. The office has not operated norm ally s ince 2013, when 
the mandate of  the then-deputy ombu dsperson expired. Cong ress has failed to 
appoint an ombudsperson since 2009. The office’s performance and ability to protect rights has been limited. 
Impunity for the AMIA Bombing 
Twenty-seven years after the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Associa-
tion (AMIA) in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people and injured more than 300, court b attles continue and no one has been convicted. Ar gentine prosecutors 
have alleged it  was c arried out by Irani an suspects. 
In January 2015, Alberto Nisman, the inves tigating prosecutor at that time, was 
found dead with a gunshot wound to the head and a pistol beside him; he had accused then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of covering up Iran’s role in the attack. In June 2018, an appeals court said Nisman’s death appeared to be a murder. As of September 2021, no one had been convicted in connection with his death. 
In March 2018, an appeals co urt upheld a decision or dering pretrial  detention for 
now-Vice President Fernández de Kirchner for allegedly conspiring with Iranian 
officials to undermine the bombing investigation during her presidency. In De-cember 2019, a federal court overturned the order. During a public hearing in July 2021, Fernández de Kirchner accused the courts of “legal persecution.” In Octo-
ber, a federal court dismissed the case against Fernández de Kirchner and offi-cials in her government, finding that Fernández de Kirchner‘s alleged conduct did not constitute a crime.  
41HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn February 2019, a court acquitted former President Carlos Menem of interfer-
ence in the initial investigation into the bomb ing but convicted a former head of 
intelligence and a judge. An appeal of the judge’s conviction remained pending as of September 2021. 
Indigenous Rights 
Indigenous people face obstacles acce ssing justice, land, education, health 
care, and basic ser vices. Argentina has repeatedly failed to imp lement laws  pro-
tecting Indigenous peoples’ right u nder international law to free, prior, and in-
formed consent to government and  business decisions th at may affect their 
rights. Debates on a national law on Indigenous communal ownership of tradi-tional lands, which the Argentine Constit ution protects, are continually post-
poned. 
Children’s Rights 
At least 357 ,000 children—and up  to 694,000—discontinued their schooling dur-
ing 2020 in Argentina, UNICEF reported. Due to Covid-19 related restrictions, most schools were closed between March and December 2020 and for shorter periods in some parts of the country in 2 021, when a gradual  return to  classes 
took place. The impact was greatest on low-income families, UNICEF said, and 
around 20 percent of those who dropped out in 2020 were still without school-
ing in May 2021. 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights 
In December 2020, Argentina’s Congress passed a landmark bill to legalize abor-tion up to the 14th week of pregnancy. The law also allows termination of preg-
nancies after that term in cases of rape or when the life or health of the pregnant 
person is at risk. However, there are repor ts of obstacles to access legal abor-
tion, including lack of access to information about the law, improper use of con-scientious objection by healthcare profess ionals, and undue delays. Women 
with disabilities who are under court or ders specifically restricting their legal ca-
pacity in connection with the exercise of their reproductive rights, or who have been declared legally  incompetent, are r equired to have assistanc e from their 
42WORLD REPORT 2022legal representative or relative to consent to abortions, which creates obstacles 
for their exercise of this right.  
Also in December, Congress approved a separ ate law to provide support to preg-
nant people and their children for the fi rst 1,000 days of the child’s life. 
Despite a 2009 law detailing comprehen sive measures to prevent and  prosecute 
violence against women, their unpunished killing remains a serious concern. The 
latest available data from the National Registry of Femicides, administered by the Supreme Court, reported 251 f emicides—the murder of women based on 
their gender—and only four convictions, in 2020. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
In 2010, Argentina became the first Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage. 
In 2012, Argentina passed a Gender Identity La w allowing anyone to change their 
gender and name on identity cards and birth certificates through a simple ad-ministrative procedure. 
In July 2021, President Fernández recognized non-binary identities, enabling citi-
zens and non-national residents to choose a third gender category, “X” (neither male or female), on identity cards and passports. Argentina is the first country in Latin America to establish such a category. 
Key International Actors and Foreign Policy 
In 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Macri administration agreed on a US$57 billion loan. At time of writing, the Fernández administration was r e-negotiating the IMF loan amid a deep economic crisis that  predates the 
pandemic and was deepened by it. The cr isis has severely  impacted people liv-
ing in poverty, who according to government statistics amount to 40 percent of 
the population. 
As a member of  the United Nations  Human Rights Counci l, Argentin a has sup-
ported UN scrutiny of rights violations in Belarus, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Nicaragua, and Venezuel a. In October 2021, Argentina was r e-elected for the 2022-2024 
term. 
43HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHHowever, Argentina’s for eign policy towards  Venezuela and Nicar agua has been 
inconsistent. It abstained from an Organization of American States (OAS) resolu-tion rejecting Venezuela’s December 2020 elections, which are widely consid-ered to have been fraudulent. It also abstained, in June and October 2021, from OAS resolutions condemning arrests of Nicaraguan presidential opposition can-didates and critics. Argentina and Mexi co, which also abstained in both opportu-
nities, issued a stat ement justifying their June de cision u nder the princip le of 
non-intervention in the internal affairs of states. 
In November 2021, Argentina voted in favor of an OAS resolution that con-
demned Nicaraguan presidential elections saying the elections “were not free, fair or transparent, and lack democratic legitimacy.” 
In 2021, Argentina withdrew from the Lim a Group, a coalition of governments 
monitoring Venezuela’s poor human rights record, and from a 2018 request to the Prosecutor’s Office of the Internation al Criminal Court—made together with 
Canada, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, and  Peru—for an inves tigation into possible 
crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela. 
While Argentina rightfully condemned rep ression against protesters by the 
Colombian police, it failed to criticize abuses against demonstrators in Cuba. 
Argentina hosted a virtual summit on climate change in September 2021 with 
representatives from Latin American and Cari bbean countries, the US special 
envoy on climate change, and the UN secretary-general. 
In September 2020, two Argentine girls were  killed in neighboring Paraguay dur-
ing an operation by members of a military-led elite unit against Paraguay’s main 
guerrilla group. Serious deficienc ies and irregularities marr ed Paraguay’s investi-
gation, and in October 2021, Argentina and Paraguay agreed to establish an ex-pert international forensic team to work on the case. 
In June 2020 and September 2021, Argentina informed the UN secretary-general 
that it was t emporarily der ogating some of its oblig ations under the Internation al 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to address the Covid-19 pandemic. 
44WORLD REPORT 2022Armenia 
The 2020 truce ending the six-week war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in and 
around Nagorno-Karabakh largely held, b ut periodic skirmishes made for a frag-
ile situation on the post-war front lines. 
The political cr isis follow ing the defeat of ethnic  Armenian forces was largely  de-
fused in the June sn ap election, which resulted in a de cisive v ictory for the ruling 
party and reconfirmation of Nikol Pacinian as prime minister. International ob-servers found the polls genuinely competitive and in line with international stan-dards. 
Domestic violence, discrimination against peop le with disabilities, barriers to ef-
fective pain treatment and palliative  care, and violence and discrimination 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity persisted. Striving to fight rising incidents of hate speech, authorities intr oduced regulations which may under-
mine freedom of speech. 
Aftermath of Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict  
Ethnic Armenian prisoners continued to be det ained and prosecuted by Azerbai-
jan. In September 2021, the Armenian Ombudsman’s Office stated that at least 41 prisoners of w ar (POWs) and 4 civi lian detainees remain in Azerbaijani cus-
tody. Numerous Armenian POWs were subjected to cruel and degrading treat-ment and torture by Azerbaijani forces either when they were captured, during their transfer, or while in custody at v arious detention facilities. (See Azerbaijan 
chapter). In 2021, ne arly 100 Armenian PO Ws and civi lian detainees were re-
turned by Azerbaijan. 
The fighting compounded the loss of education due to Covid-19-related school 
closures. According to official data, at least 71 schools were damaged or de-stroyed on the Armenian side and 54 on the Azerbaijani side. 
Ongoing incidents of military hostilities threa ten the safety and livelihoods of 
civilians res iding in villages in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Armenia-Azer-
baijan border, mostly on the Armenian s ide. Russian peacekeepers reported the 
October 9 killing of a civi lian in Martakert (Aghdara) district, while he was f arm-
45HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHing, due to gunfire from the Azerbaijani side. With no independent human rights 
monitoring in Nagorno-Karabakh, there is no mec hanism to address problems 
arising from cross-border shooting s and other insecurities.   
In August, the Azerbaijani prosecutor-general’s office said that since the cease-
fire, 23 Azerbaij ani civi lians were kil led and 36 were injured by anti-personnel 
and anti-vehicle mines laid in ar eas over which Azerb aijan re-estab lished con-
trol. Among them were two Azerbaijani journalists and a local official, who were killed on June 4. Landmine contamination in all of the seven regained regions around Nagorno-Karabakh is reported to be ex tensive  and widespre ad. In July, 
Armenia handed over landmine maps, detailing the location of around 92,000 anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines in Fizu li and Zangelan regions; Azerbaijan 
handed over 15 captured Armenian soldiers in exchange for the maps. Neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan have ratified the international treaty prohibiting antiper-sonnel landmines. 
A report by International Partners hip for Human Rights, an independent group, 
on international humanitarian law violations during the Nagorno-Karabakh war, found “prima facie evidence of two extrajudicial executions of wounded Azerbai-jani combatants by Armenian/Nagorno-Karabak h soldiers.” It al so documented 
the ill-treatment, including torture, of seven Azerbaijani POWs by these forces. (See Azerbaijan chapter for allegations of  executions of Armenian troops by 
Azerbaijan forces). 
Human Rights Watch is not aware of  any investig ations by Armenian authorities 
into alleged war crimes committed by Armenian forces during the war.  
Accountability for Law Enforcement Abuse and Torture in 
Custody 
Torture and ill-treatment in custody remains a problem and it is often perpe-
trated with impunity. Even when criminal investigations are launched in re-
sponse to allegations of torture, they are rarely effective.  
According to Helsinki Citizen’s Assembly Vanadzor (HCAV), a local non-govern-
mental org anization, criminal  investig ations are mos tly closed on the b asis of 
findings that no crime was c ommitted or sus pended for the lack  of a suspect. 
The group reported that no one has been convicted for tor ture sinc e 2015, when 
46WORLD REPORT 2022torture became a specific offense. In all instances in which officials were held ac-
countable for acts of physical abuse, they  were convicted for general “abuse of 
office” offenses.  
Freedom of Speech and Prote ction of Human Rights Defenders 
The recent war and political crises trigger ed heated public debates, which often 
included inflammatory speec h by members of parliament and other public offi-
cials that was at  times directed against hum an rights defenders and act ivists. 
The government undertook several attempts, including by introducing legislative amendments, to tackle the spread of hateful and degrading speech.  
During the first six months of 2021, the C ommittee to Protect Freedom of Expres-
sion, a local media advocacy group, doc umented 15 cases, with 17 victims, of 
physical violence against journalists perpetrated by both public officials and pri-vate individuals.  
During a parliamentary session on August 11, the speaker of parliament forbade 
journalists from filming a quarrel between pro-government and opposition par-
liamentarians. Special forces ordered jo urnalists to stop filming, and then or-
dered them out of their gallery in parliament.  
Authorities pursued spurious criminal incit ement charges against Sashik Sul-
tanyan, the chairperson of a nongovernmental group, Yezidi Center for Human 
Rights. The charges stem from an interview Sultanyan gave to the website Yezidinews.am, where he alleged discrimination of Yezidi minorities in Armenia. The National Security Service, which brought  the charges, wrongly characterized 
as “incit ement” Sultanyan’s interv iew, which was prot ected speech. The court 
review was pending at time of writing. 
Disability Rights  
In 2021, authorities continued to  establish  inclusive  education acro ss the co un-
try. In April, the go vernment approv ed a plan to establish inclusive  education in 
preschools, which contained 16 action steps to be completed by 2023. Neverthe-
less, many children with disabilities re main segregated in orp hanages, special 
schools, or at home with little or no education. 
47HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThere are 473 children with di sabilities living in five state orphanages, 463 of 
whom live in three orphanages for chi ldren with disabilities. The government has 
not announced  comprehen sive plans to  relocate children with disabilities to 
birth or foster families or transform these three institutions into community-
based service providers, but rather the government and donors continue to in-vest in them. An unknown number of chi ldren with disabilities also continue to 
live in six private orphanages, with minimal government oversight.  
Children with disabilitie s also frequently remain in institutions indefinitely when 
they become adults, stripped of their legal capacity and right to independent liv-ing. Adults with psychosocial or intellectual  disabilities can be deprived of legal 
capacity, or the right to make decis ions, and Armenia lacks supported decision-
making mechanisms. 
In May, parliament adopted the Law on the Rights  of Persons with Disabilities, 
which includes guarantees of accessibi lity, independent living, and access to 
justice, and bans disability-based discrimination. The new law, however, does 
not create a dedicated body to oversee the law’s implementation. 
Violence against Women and Children 
Domestic violence remains a persistent  problem. Domestic violence cases are 
largely underreported. According to official data, during the first six months of 2021, authorities investigated 326 criminal domestic violence complaints. Of the 
326, charges were brought against 14 5 persons, and in 90 of those the husband 
was identified as the alleged perpetra tor.  
The 2017 family violence law requires police to urgently intervene “when there is 
a reasonable assumption of an immediat e threat of repetition or the continua-
tion of violence” in the family. But in practice, law enforcement bodies lack 
awareness and training on pr otection mechanisms included in the law, such as 
protection orders, and do not adequat ely apply or enforce them. 
There are only two domestic violence s helters, both in the capital, Yerevan, run 
by nongovernmental organizations, each with a capacity for five women and their children. This is far below the Council of Europe standard of one shelter 
space per 10,000 people. Armenia also lacks a general hot-line service for sur-
vivors of domestic violence. 
48WORLD REPORT 2022Armenia signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating 
Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) in 2018, 
but the ratification process remained stalled. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) 
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Armenia continue to face harass ment, discrimin ation, and violence. The criminal  code does not rec-
ognize animus due to sexual orientation or gender identity as aggravating crimi-nal circumstances in hate crimes.  
Fear of discrimination and possible humiliation due to public disclosure of their 
sexual orientation or gender identity prevent many LGBT people from reporting 
crimes against them, even when these are clearly motivated by anti-LGBT bias. But even when reported, in vestigations  into such crimes are often inc onclusive 
or ineffective.  
PINK Armenia, an LGBT rights group, docu mented 12 incidents of physical at-
tacks based on sexual orientation or gender identity from January through Au-gust 2021, and eight cases of threats and calls for physical and psychological 
violence. In 13 cases, vio lence and threat of violenc e was c ommitted by a family 
member. 
Victims of four attacks filed complaints  with the police, who dismissed three of 
them claiming no crime had been committed. PINK Armeni a has no information 
about the fourth. Police issued warnings in two of the three cases in which the 
violence was c ommitted by a family member, but did not issue any restr aining 
measures.  
During the pre-election period, politicians u sed homophobia to advance their 
campaigns by smearing LGBT people as a threat to the family, national identity, and nation al security. Some opposition forces  accused civil society or ganiza-
tions of destroying national values and spreading LGBT “propaganda.” 
Armenia does not have compr ehensive  anti-disc rimination legi slation.  
49HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHKey International Actors 
The Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, co-
chaired by the United States, France, and Russia, re-engaged on Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations. During 2021, the co-chairs issued several statements on the aftermath of the war, r eiterating their wi llingne ss to visit the region and call-
ing on the parties to return all POWs and other detainees; exchange “all data necessary to conduct effective demining of conflict regions” and lift “restrictions on access to Nagorno-Karabakh, including for representatives of international 
humanitarian or ganizations”; preserve and protect religious and  cultural her-
itage; and foster “direct contacts and  co-operation between conflict-affected 
communities.” After a long hiat us, the Minsk Group co-c hairs met in New York 
during the UN General Assembly.  
The European Union also called on the par ties to refrain from military actions 
and called on Azerbaijan to release all prisoners of war and detainees. 
A November 2 021 memorandum by Council of Europe Commiss ioner for Human 
Rights Dunja Mijatović recommended, among other things, to “ensure free and unhindered acce ss of humanitarian assistanc e and intern ational h uman rights 
missions to a ll areas affected  by the conflict.” 
A September resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
called on Azerbaijani authorities to free all remaining prisoners and urged Ar-menian authorities to release all mine maps. It  also called on the sides to ensure 
accountability for the crimes committed during the war. 
In their August joint statement, the UN special rapporteurs on minority issues, 
on the situation of human rights defender s, and on the promotion and protec-
tion of the right to freedom of expression called on Armenia to drop charges 
against Sashik Sultanyan.  
In its May report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhu-
man or Degrading Treatment criticized de facto detention of people with disabili-ties who remain in psychiatric facilities involuntarily due to the absence of 
appropriate community-based services.  The committee urged the government to 
prioritize these services and de-institutionalization.  
50WORLD REPORT 2022The European Committee of Social Rights’ January conclusions criticized Arme-
nia’s insufficient access to housing and  public transportation for people with 
disabilities; failure to ban employment discrimination on grounds of sexual ori-
entation; and the lack of an explicit stat utory guarantee of equal pay for women 
and men for equal work. 
In March, the EU-Armenia Compr ehensive  and Enhanc ed Partnership Agreement, 
which includes pro visions on str engthening democracy, the ru le of law and 
human rights, entered into force.  
Also in March, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed the importance of 
the rule of law and democratic institutions in a call with Prime Minister Pashinyan. 
51HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAustralia 
Australia is a vibr ant multicul tural democracy with a strong reco rd of protecting 
civil and po litical rights, but serious h uman rights issues remain. The Australian 
government’s failure to address the significant overrepresentation of First Na-tions people in the criminal justice system and cruel treatment of asylum seek-ers tarnishes the country’s global standing. 
As the Covid-1 9 pandemic continued, ther e was a la ck of equitab le vaccine ac-
cess for at-risk communities in 2021, including 
First Nations  people and prison-
ers in New South Wales. Australia is one of a handful of countries that has 
severely restricted free movement intern ationally to respond to the pandemic. 
Until November 2021, Australia banned its citizens from traveling abroad unless 
they meet strict criteria and limited the return of citizens through strict arrival caps.  
Asylum Seekers and Refugees 
2021 marked eight years since the Aus tralia government reint roduced offshore 
processing of asylum seekers who arrive by boat. Approximat ely 230 refugees 
and asylum seekers remained in Papua New Guinea and Nauru at time of writing, with more than 900 refugees admitted to the United States under an Australia-
US resettlement deal. Australia announced  it will end its offshore agreement 
with Papua New Guinea at the end of 2021, transferring people who remain there to Nauru or giving them the option to remain in PNG with a promise of a “perma-nent migration pathway.” 
More than 80 refugees and asylum seekers transferred to Aus tralia from Papua 
New Guinea and Nauru for medical or other reasons remain in detention. Aus-tralia has rejected 
offers  by New Zealand to take some of the refugees. At least 
12 refugees and asylum seekers have died in Australia’s offs hore processing sys-
tem since 2013, 6 of them suicides.  
Some of the refugees and asylum seeker s transferred from Papua New Guinea 
and Nauru to Australia have been detained  in hotel rooms, where access to sun-
light, space to exercise, and fresh air is limited. A Kurdish refugee who spent more than 14 months detained in a Melbourne hotel room 
sued  the Australian 
52WORLD REPORT 2022government, arguing its  use of hotels for immigr ation detention is unlawful. In 
October, more than 20 asylum seekers contracted Covid-19  while in hotel deten-
tion.  
An ethnic Tamil asylum seeker couple fr om Sri Lanka and their two Australian-
born children spent two years in immigration detention on Chri stmas Isl and. In 
June, their 3 -year-old d aughter was airlifted to a hospital in  Perth  after she fell 
seriously ill and medical facilities on the island were inadequate. Following the medical emergency, the government allowed the family to remain in Australia 
temporarily , but has 
denied  the family’s application for permanent visas. 
Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August, Australian Prime Min-
ister Scott Morrison  rejected calls to allow at least 4,200 Afghans in Australia on 
temporary visas to be given a pathway to permanent residency. The government earmarked 3,000 humanitarian visas in 2021 for Afghans. The government evac-uated 3,500 people from Afghanistan to Aus tralia after the Taliban took over 
Kabul. 3,000 of these evacuees were Afgh an nationals with Australian visas. At 
time of writing, more than 200 Australian citizens or visa holders remain 
stranded in Afghanistan after fai led attempts to evacuate them.  
Indigenous Rights 
Indigenous Australians are significantly overr epresented in the criminal justice 
system, with Aboriginal and Torres Str ait Islander people comprising 30 percent 
of Australia’s adult prison population, but just 3 percent of the national popula-tion.  
At least 11 Indigenous people died in cust ody in Australia in 2021.  
A coronial inqu est into the death of a 36 -year-old A boriginal m an in a New South 
Wales prison after he had an asthma attack, found ther e was a “confused, un-
reasonably delayed, and uncoordinated” medical response by prison staff. In March, a prison officer 
faced court  on charges of manslaughter over the shooting 
death of an A boriginal pri soner who was handcuffed and shackled  at the time.  
In March, the state of Victoria announced the creation of a truth and justice com-
mission to investigate two centurie s of violence, abuse, and discrimination 
against Australia’s First Nations peop le, modelled on the South African Truth and 
Reconciliation Commiss ion.  
53HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHChildren’s Rights 
Indigenous children are 17 times  more likely to be incarcerated than non-In-
digenous children. 
Approximately 500 children under the age of 14 were imprisoned in the past year 
across Australia. In January 2021, Austr alia disregarded calls by 31 UN member 
states who recommended the government raise the age of criminal responsibil-ity from 10 years old to the internationally recommended minimum of 14 years.  
New punitive bail laws for children introduced in the Northern Territory led to an 
increase in the number of children in detention, the majority of them Indige-nous. Similar laws introduced in Queensland created, contrary to international 
human rights law, a
 presumption against bail for chi ldren charged with crimes 
such as assault, attempted robbery, unauthorised use of a motor vehicle where 
the child is a driver, and dangerous driving. 
Covid-19 
Australia has rest ricted the rights  of its own c itizens to enter and le ave their own 
country.  
Strict arrival quotas due to limited quar antine facilities left more than 43,000 
Australian citizens stranded abroad. 
From March 2020 to November 2021, Australia banned  its citizens from leaving 
the country  as a public health measure during the Covid-19 pandemic, unless 
they met strict criteria . In August 2021, the ban was exp anded to include Aus-
tralians who normally live abroad. This punitive approach to travel left tens of thousands of Australi an families separated from their loved ones.  
After a spike in Covid-19 cases in Indi a in May, the Australian government an-
nounced a temporary measure of banning Australians who had been in India 
from entering Australia. Those who disobeyed could face fines of up to 
AU$66,000 (US$56,000) or five years in prison. No bans on citizens were put in place following similar spikes in 2020 in the US and UK.  
Strict and inflexible domestic travel rest rictions inside Australia left families sep-
arated and others unable to return home, with individuals 
refused permiss ion to 
54WORLD REPORT 2022travel across state borders for compassion ate reasons or medical treatment, de-
spite willingness to abide by quarantine restrictions.  
In July 2021, Australia had one of the lowest vaccination rates among high-in-
come countries, due to a shortage in vaccine supply and a botched rollout of its national vaccination program. 
Although the Australian feder al government designated Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander adults as a priority group for vaccinations in January 2021, vacci-nation rates for Indigenous communities 
lagged behind  the rate of the total pop-
ulation in most parts of Australia.   
In New South Wales, Covid-19 spread quickly inside prisons among prisoners 
who had not yet been offered the chance to  be vaccinated. The state government 
failed to ensure equitable vaccine access for prisoners, with prisoner vaccination rates lagging well behind the general population. 
Freedom of Expression 
Human Rights Watch research found that Australian universities are failing to 
protect the academic freedom of students from China and of academics  who 
criticize the Chinese Communist Party,  leaving them vu lnerable to harass ment 
and intimidation by Chinese government supporters. Chinese pro-democracy 
students in Australia alter their behavior and self-censor to avoid threats and ha-rassment fr om fellow c lassmates and being “reported on” by them to  authorities 
back home. 
A 
new regulation  was int roduced into p arliament in August  that would make it 
easier to deregister nongovernmental organiz ations if they promote protests in 
which minor offenses occur. 
Disability Rights 
The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and  Exploitation of  People 
with a Disability continued its hearings in 2021, focusing on a range of issues in-cluding the experiences of First Nation chi ldren with disability in out-of-home 
care, and concerns that the Covid-19 vaccine rollout for people with disabilities 
has been too slow.

with disabilitie s. A Human Rights Watch  analysis of deaths  in those prisons from 
2010-2020 found that about 60 percent of adult prisoners who died had a dis-ability. Due to limited resources, mental  health services in prisons are inade-
quate. 
Rights of Older People 
The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Saf ety relea sed its 
final report in March 2021, calling for fundamental reform of the aged care sys-tem, including increased accountability f or violations in aged care facilities, min-
imum staffing requirements, and greater access to home and community support services for older people.   
The Covid-19 p andemic has high lighted syst emic underst affing and gaps in regu-
lation. Many aged care facilities u se dangerous drugs, oft en without informed 
consent, to control the behavior of older people with dementia. The government has not b anned the practice and  has not c onducted suffic ient monitoring of  facil-
ities’ compliance with existing regulations.   
Terrorism and Counterterrorism  
The Australian gov ernment has failed to repatriate nationals arbitrarily  detained 
by Kurdish-led authorities in northeast Syria as Islamic State suspects and family 
members. At time of writing, approximately 80 Australians including 47 children 
and 20 women remained held in harsh conditions in locked camps and prisons. The government helped bring home eight childr en from northeast Syria in 2019. 
A bill to create new police powers to conduct online surveillance of criminal sus-
pects and take over their accounts  was passed  by parli ament in August, despite 
the legislation failing to implement saf eguards recommended by a parliamentary 
committee.  
57HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHClimate Change Policy and Impacts  
Australia is among the top 20 emitters and one of the world’s biggest per capita 
emitters of the green house gases responsib le for the climate crisis, and  the re-
sulting toll on human rights around the globe.  
The third largest exporter of fossil fuels globally, Aus tralia’s fossil fuel compa-
nies also benefit from s ignificant tax breaks, with fossil fuel subsidies increasing 
48 percent since the Paris agreement in 2015.   
In 2015, the government  pledged to reduc e emissions by 26 to  28 perc ent by 
2030 compared to 2005 levels. In October , just days before the COP26 Climate 
conference in Glasgow, Austr alia announced it had set a target for net zero car-
bon emissions by 2050. Howe ver, it does not inc lude a commitment  to end 
fossil fuels and did not reveal ho w it would achieve this target.  
The government has c ontinued to actively  support the expansion of  fossil fuel in-
dustries at the expense of renewables, approving several new coal mines includ-
ing one  requiring  public financing.  
In a major ruling in a case brought on beh alf of survivors  from the devas tating 
2019-20 bushfires, in August a court in New South Wales ordered the state’s En-
vironmental Protection Authority to take concre te and specific steps to safeguard 
against climate change.  
In September, the Western Australi a state government announced an  end to the 
logging of native forests in an effort to preserve carbon sinks. 
Foreign Policy  
In August, the Australian government annou nced an intention to strengthen its 
targeted s anctions regime on h uman rights grou nds, but no legi slation has been 
introduced and the scope of the sanctions remains unclear.  
Unlike the UK, US, Canad a, and the EU, the A ustralian go vernment has not im-
posed targeted sanctions on senior milit ary leaders in Myanmar responsible for 
the February coup and ensuing rights violations. 
58WORLD REPORT 2022Australia joined statements condemning the Chinese governments violations in 
Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet at the UN Human Rights Council in June, and on Xinjiang at the UN General Assembly in October.  
In August, the Senate passed a bill banning the importation of goods made by 
forced labor, after concerns over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. However, the government voted against the bill in the Senate. 
In September, Australia publicly announced that it would back the Indian and 
South African proposal for a waiver of the TRIPS agreement, the World Trade Or-
ganization’s intellectual property rules for Covid-19 vaccines and other health 
products to enable quicker and fair er access for low-income countries.  
Australia p ledged AU$100 mil lion (US$74 million) in hum anitarian assistanc e to 
Afghanist an following the Tal iban takeover of the coun try. No action was taken to 
compensate victims of alleged war crimes by Australian SAS forces as docu-mented in the Breret on report, which found credible information of 23 incidents 
of unlawful ki lling, which kil led 39 people.  
Australia has not endorsed the Safe Schools Declar ation, an intergo vernment al 
pledge now supported by 112 countries to  protect education in times of conflict.  
 
59HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAzerbaijan  
The 2020 truce ending the six-week war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in and 
around Nagorno-Karabakh largely held, bu t periodic skirmishes made for a frag-
ile situation on the post-war front lines.  
The ceasefire enab led the start of reconst ruction in ar eas wher e Azerbaijan re-
established  control. In ar eas u nder the control of  de-facto Nagorno Karabakh au-
thorities, ethnic Armenians face risk of injury or captivity when they travel, tend to livestock, or engage in farming near the front lines. These and other issues, 
including Nagorno-Karabakh’s long-term stat us, perpetuated tensions and 
pointed to the need for grea ter international involvement. 
In March, the government released, under a presidential pardon, nearly 40 op-
position act ivists, religious believers, jo urnalists, human rights defenders, and 
other perceived critics imprisoned on politically  motivated charges. But dozens 
of others remained wrongfully imprisoned , while authorities targeted critics and 
other dissenting voices. 
In the period since the war’s start, tensions between the government and politi-
cal opposition declined. However, the government remained hostile to dissent-ing voices. Restrictive laws continued to prevent nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from operating independently. Reports of torture and ill-treatment per-sisted throughout the year.  
Nagorno Karabakh: Landmines, Prisoners of War (POWs)  
In August, the Prosecutor General’s Office said that since the ceasefire, 23 Azer-baijani civilians we re killed and  36 were injured by anti-personnel and anti-vehi-
cle mines laid in ar eas that had prev iously been under Armenian forces’ control. 
Among them were two Azerbaijani journalists and a local official, who were killed on June 4. Landmine contamination in all of the seven regained regions around Nagorno Karabakh is reported to be exten sive (See Armenia chapter). Neither 
Azerbaijan nor Armenia has r atified the intern ational tr eaty proh ibiting anti-per-
sonnel landmines.  
60WORLD REPORT 2022The fighting compounded the loss of education due to Covid-19-related school 
closures. According to official data, at least 71 schools were damaged or de-stroyed on the Armenian side and 54 on the Azerbaijani side. Despite the severe damage to schools during the conflict, Azerbaijan had yet to endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, an international agreement to protect education during 
armed conflict signed by 112 countries.  
Azerbaijani forces subjected  numerous Armenian POWs to physical abuse and 
acts of humiliation. Human Rights Watch also documented torture and other 
abuse by Azerb aijani forces against Armeni an civi lians, including ag ainst older 
people, as well as a case of extrajudicial execution in early 2021. Allegations of at least a doz en other extrajudicial ex ecutions of  Armenian troops and civi lians 
in 2020 and early 2021 also came to light. (See Armenia chapter for allegations of torture and executions of Azerbaijani troops by Armenian/Nagorno-Karabakh forces). 
In 2021, Azerb aijan returned  more than 100 Armenian PO Ws and civi lian de-
tainees. In September, the Armenian ombudsman’s office stated that at least 41 POWs and four civilian captives re mained in Azerbaijani custody; the ex act num-
ber remaining in custody is unclear. The Azerbaijani government refuses to ac-knowledge any of these detainees as POWs.  
Although Azerbaijani authorities consistently claimed that all remaining Armen-
ian soldiers in custody were  terrorism suspects, they dr opped terrorism charges 
during the trials against several dozen and convicted them for illegal border 
crossing and weapons possession. Many were among the 30 whom Azerbaijan released in June and July in exchange for landmine maps.  
Azerbaijani courts have also sentenced at least six ethnic Armenians, some of 
whom are reportedly civili ans, on a variety of  other charges. The charges include 
terrorism, espionage, and, in two cases, torturing Azerbaijani citizens during the 
Karabakh war of the 1990s.  
In December 2020, several international media outlets reported that Azerbaijani 
authorities arrested four servicemen for desecrating the bodies of dead Armen-
ian soldiers and vandalizing gravestone s at Armenian cemeteries. At time of 
writing, they remained in pretrial detention, and no other Azerbaijani forces have been held accountable for crimes during the war.  
61HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHProsecuting Political Opposition  
In January, Popular Front Party of Azerbaijan (APFP) member Niyameddin Ahme-
dov faced new, dubious charges of incitement and trafficking in banned items. 
Ahmedov has been in custody since h is May 2020 arrest on financing t errorism 
charges, which stem from allegations that he received funds from an exiled gov-
ernment critic  to destabilize the co untry and assassinate political figu res. Police 
allegedly beat Ahmedov in custody in an attempt  to coerce him to falsely testify 
against an APFP leader. Ahmedov denies all charges. In October, a court sen-
tenced him to 13 years in prison.   
In April, a court sentenced  Said Mamedzade Bakuvi, an APFP act ivist, to  three-
and-a-half years in prison on bogus hooliganism  charges, but in June substituted 
the penalty with a suspended sentence and released him. 
In June, courts handed 12 APFP members, including five party leaders – Fuad 
Gahramanli, Mammad Ibrahim, Bakhtiyar Imanov, Asif Yusifli and Ayaz Mahar-ramli on suspended sentences ranging from tw o to four years, on spurious pub-
lic order violations and other charges related to a pro-war protest a year earlier.  
In February, Mehdi Ibrahimov, son of the APFP deputy chairman, received a 15-
month suspended sentence on bogus charges of spreading Covid-19.  
In March, President Ilham Aliyev pardoned APFP member Mahammad Imanli, 
who had been sentenced in December 2020 to one year in prison on false crimi-nal charges of spreading Covid-19. 
Also in March, police arrested Lachin V aliyev,  an opposition act ivist, on bogus 
drugs-related charges and allegedly coerced him to give incriminating state-
ments against the APFP leadership. Valiyev confessed the drug charges under apparent duress. He remained in pr etrial custody at time of writing. 
Other APFP members serving prison sentences on bogus charges handed down 
in previous years include Alizamin Salayev , Saleh Rustamov, Agil Maharramov, 
and Pasha Umudov.  
In July, an appeals court replaced the house arrest of Tofig Yagublu, a leading 
politician of the opposition Musavat party, with a 30-month conditional sen-tence. Yagublu had been under house arrest due to health complications arising 
62WORLD REPORT 2022from his hunger strike to protest his unjust 2020 conviction on bogus hooligan-
ism charges, for which he ha d been sentenced to four years and three months in 
prison. 
In May, the Azerbaijani Bar Association, whic h is seen as closely tied to the gov-
ernment, reinstated lawyers Shahla Humb atova and Irada Javadova, who had 
been disbarred in previous years in appar ent retaliation for their work on politi-
cally sensitive cases. 
Freedom of Expression  
In March, a court sentenced b logger Elchin Hasanz ade and act ivist Ibr ahim 
Salamov to eight months in prison on defamation charges, for corruption and other allegations they made against the head of Mingechevir city’s housing and maintenance department. They were released in November.  
In February, an appeals court upheld a lower court’s spurious high treason ver-
dict against journ alist Polad Aslanov,  for which he continues to serve a 16 -year 
prison sentence. 
In July, a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project 
(OCCRP) alleged  Azerbaijan has been spying on over a thousand  independent 
activis ts and journ alists, using Pega sus surveillanc e software th at gave the gov-
ernment access to their phones. Investigative journalist Khadija Ismayilova and 
blogger Mehman Huseynov were among those reportedly targeted. 
Gender-Based Violence 
Gender-based  violence remained pervasive but u nderreported. Serious gaps 
continued in the official response including lack of protection and recourse for survivors.  
Restrictions related to Covid-19 additionally led to a surge in domestic violence, 
and shelter managers said they saw inc reases in the numbers of women seeking 
shelter. Womens’ rights act ivists r eported police failure to  register or respond to 
reports of domestic violence, and signific ant barriers to accessing the few avail-
able shelters.  
63HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn what appe ars to be a growing cr isis of murders of women by their partners or 
relatives, victims were often unable to escape abuse due to lack of shelter space and inadequate police response. In July alone, journalists reported that five 
women were murdered by their partners. In August, Azerbaijan’s General Prose-
cutor’s Office released data showing that in the first half of 2021, 33 women in the country had been killed; women’s rights researchers said that most were killed by their husbands, partners, or f amily members. The p rosecutor’s office 
publicly encouraged women to use a government hotline to report violence.  
On March 8, Baku polic e briefly detained  activis ts to prevent  them from holding 
an International Women’s Day march to protest gender-based violence and to call on the government to ratify the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Pre-vention of Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.  
Torture and Ill-Treatment in Detention  
Authorities typically dismissed complaints of torture and other ill-treatment in custody, and the practice continued with impunity. Ill-treatment is rampant in police custody, allegedly to coerce c onfessions, while denying detainees access 
to family, independent lawyers, or independent medical care. 
Throughout 2021, details emerged supporting allegations that in 2017 , military 
and security officials tortured detainees to extract confessions and other testi-mony on treason charges. Most of the arrests took place in Tatar region, against military personnel. The World Organization Agains t Torture (OMCT), stated that at 
least 78 were detained, and 25 sentenced to between 12 and 20 years in prison, in closed trials, “with multiple cases of  torture.” At least five of the detainees 
died within days of their arrest in May 2020.  
In August, a court sentenced Yunis Safarov, accused of an attempt on the life of 
the Ganja city mayor, to life imprisonment. Courts sentenced nine other defen-dants in this case to prison terms from 18 to 20 years. Safarov and all the defen-
dants testified in court that police had beat  them repeatedly to elicit confessions 
and testimony. No effective investigations followed the allegations. 
64WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors 
In February, a group of United Nations h uman rights special procedures mandate 
holders called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to investigate “allegations of serious 
human rights violations committed during the [Nagorno-Karabakh] conflict and its aftermath in order to hold perpetrators to account and provide redress to the victims.” The UN human rights experts called for the release of prisoners of war (POWs) captured in the conflict and for the re turn of bodies to families for burial.  
In May, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on Azerbaijan to 
unconditionally release Armenian POWs and ensure their access to lawyers, doc-tors and human rights defenders. It also urged Azerbaijan to cooperate with the 
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in investigating reports about inhuman treatment of POWs.  
In April, Council of Eu rope Human Rights C ommiss ioner, Dunja Mij atovic, ex-
pressed concern at “dehumanising scenes, including wax mannequins depicting dead and dying Armenians soldiers” that ar e included in displays at the Trophy 
Park, dedicated to Azerbaijan’s victory in the Nagorno-Karbakh war. Mijatovic said “I consider such images highly disturbing and hu miliating.” In October, 
Azerbaijan removed the displays of wax mannequins and the helmets of soldiers 
seized during the war. 
A September resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
(PACE) called on Azerbaijani authorities to free all remaining captives and urged Armenian authorities to release all mine maps. It  also called on the sides to en-
sure accountability for the crimes committed during the war. 
In March, the US government welcomed the presidential pardon, and called on 
the government to release everyone “considered to have been incarcerated for exercising their fundamental freedoms.” Also in Ma rch, US Secretary of State An-
thony Blinken called for r einstatement of Humbatova to the Bar Association. 
In May, following its human rights dialogue with Azerbaijan, the European Union 
welcomed the reinstatement of Humbatov a and Javadova and highlighted the 
importance of accountability for violations of international humanitarian law. The EU repeatedly called for Azerbaijan to release all “prisoners and detainees” 
captured in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  
65HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn June, the PACE rapporteur on political prisoners in Azerbaijan said the prob-
lem of political prisoners in Azerbaijan, as described in its January 2020 resolu-
tion, “ has been neither duly rec ognized nor adequat ely addressed by the 
authorities, let alone resolved.”  
In a separate statement, the PACE Legal Affairs Committee expressed “particular 
disappointment” at the failure by the Azerbaijani delegation to the Assembly to co-operate with the rapporteur on political prisoners as well as the Azerbaijani authorities’ continuing failure to implement fully European Court judgments.  
In August, reacting to the spike in killings of women by their families in July, the 
British Embassy in Azerbaijan expressed concern over the killing of Azerbaijani women, and called on the Azerbaijani government to sign the Istanbul Conven-tion.  
66WORLD REPORT 2022Bahrain 
Bahraini act ivists c ommemorated the 10th ann iversary of the 2011 uprising in 
Bahrain amid continuing heavy repression. Since 2017 , Bahraini authorities have banned all independent media in the country and dissolved all significant oppo-sition groups. Authorities failed to hold officia ls accountable for torture and ill-
treatment. Oversight mechanisms are not independent of the government. 
Three detainees died in Bahraini prisons in 2021 amid allegations of medical 
negligence. Health and hygiene conditions in Bahrain’s overcrowded prisons re-main serious, leading to two major Covid-19 outbreaks. Prison authorities vio-lently suppressed a peaceful sit-in at the Jau Prison, and security forces summoned for interrogation and arrested individuals who participated in 
protests calling for the release of  their family members from detention.  
There are 26 individuals currently on death row, all at imminent risk of execu-
tion. The government  has put six people to  death since it ended a mor atorium on 
executions in 2017 , most recently in 2019.  
Bahrain continued to deny access to independent rights monitors and the United 
Nations special procedures, including the s pecial rapporteur on torture.  
Freedom of Expression, Association, and Peaceful Assembly 
Bahrain further restricted online content  by amending the Press Law to require 
that news and broadcasting sites regist er and obtain Ministry of Information Af-
fairs approval, and to ban electronic media from publishing content that con-
flicts with “national interest” or the constitution.  
Between June 2020 and May 2021, at least 58 people  were arrested, detained, or 
prosecuted for their online act ivities, Freedom House reported. 
In July 2021, it  was reported that B ahrain, alr eady believed to be a customer  of 
the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware  had entered phone num bers of potential tar-
gets into a databa se, which was leaked . In August 2021, Citizen Lab reported 
that the iPhones of  nine Bahraini act ivists were  successfully ha cked with NSO 
Group’s Pegasus  spyware betw een June 2020 and  February 2021. NSO Group has 
repeatedly denied  the news reports.  
67HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThirteen prominent d issidents have been ser ving lengthy prison terms since 
their arrest in 2011 for their roles in pro-democracy demonstrations. They include Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a founder of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, as well as Hassan Mushaima and Abduljalil al- Singace, leaders of the opposition group 
Al Haq; all are serving life terms.  
Al-Singace began a 
hunger strike  on July 8 to protest inhumane prison conditions  
and to demand that a book that he wrote in prison, and which prison authorities 
confiscated, be returned to his fami ly. Between July and September, al-Singace 
lost nearly 20 kilograms and is suffering from pre-existing medical conditions, his family says, f or which he has not rece ived adequate treatment.  
Shaikh Ali Salman, leader of Al-Wifaq, Bahrain’s largest but now forcibly dis-
solved opposition political society, is also serving a life term after the Court of 
Cassation upheld his sentence in January 2019 on trumped up charges of al-legedly spying for Qatar. 
In June 2020, authorities released fr om prison prominent human rights defender 
Nabeel Rajab to serve the rest  of his 5-year sentence for speec h offenses under 
the 2017 alternative sentencing law.  
No independent media have operated in Bahrain since the Information Affairs 
Ministry suspended Al Wasat , the country’s only independent newspaper, in 
2017. Foreign journalists rarely have access to Bahrain, and Human Rights Watch and other rights groups are routinely denied access.  
Death Penalty  
The Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) and Reprieve found that since the 2011 uprising, 51 people have been sentenced to death. Of those, 26 individuals are currently on death row, all at imminent risk of execution, having exhausted all legal remedies. In July 2020, the Court of Cassation 
upheld the 
death sentences  of Mohamed Ramadan and Hussein Ali Moosa, despite unfair 
trials and credible evidence that their convictions were based on confessions co-erced under torture.  
68WORLD REPORT 2022According to BIRD and Reprieve, of the 51 people sentenced to death since 2011, 
at least 31 were convicted under Bahrain’s overbroad terrorism law, and of those, 20 alleged torture.  
Bahrain has ex ecuted six men s ince it ended a moratorium in 2017 on use of the 
death penalty.  
Security Forces and Prisons 
At least three prisoners died during 2021, allegedly from the lack of adequate medical care.  
On April 6, the Police Media Center 
announced  that Abbas Malallah died of a 
heart attack, but Malallah’s family claimed  that during his 10 years in prison he 
had been suffering from chronic illnesses, and other prisoners told  Bahraini 
rights groups that the Jau prison authorities did not respond to Malallah’s pleas for medical attention before he lost consciousness.  
Malallah’s death prompted 
protests  in Bahrain, including an April 17 sit-in in Jau 
Prison  protesting the prison authorities’ medical negligence, particularly during 
the Covid-19 p andemic. According to a Bahraini hum an rights act ivist, the au-
thorities summoned at least 10 protesters  for interrogation on April 6, and de-
tained family members of several  prominent political prisoners. The UN high 
commissioner for human rights expressed concern that security forces used “ un-
necessary and disproportionate force ” to dismantle the peaceful sit-in at the 
prison on April 17 and reportedly held many prisoners incommunicado .  
In an apparent response to the Covid-1 9 pandemic, the Public Prosecution an-
nounced  on April 8 the release of 73 det ainees under the alternative sentencing 
law. A Covid-19 outbreak at Jau Prison, which is notoriously crowded, led to the 
death of Husein Barakat  on June 9. B ahrain’s Int erior Ministry has not released 
accurate information on the number of infections, but rights groups  said scores 
of detainees had contracted Covid-19 and that detainees were not provided with personal protective equipment, adequate medical  care, or the ability to commu-
nicate with their families.  
69HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn July 25, Hasan Abdulnabi, who suffered from sickle cell disease, died amid al-
legations  that he was denied adequate medical tr eatment at  the Dry Dock Deten-
tion Center. 
Authorities have failed to credibly investig ate and prosecute officials and police 
officers who allegedly committed serious violations, including torture, since the 2011 protests.  
Children’s Rights 
Police beat children arrested in protest-rel ated cases in early February 2021, in 
the lead up to the 10th anniversary of the uprising in Bahrain, and threatened them with rape and electric shocks. Pro secutors and judges, who refused to 
allow the children’s parents or lawyer s to be present during their interrogations 
and ordered their detention, enabled the abuses. A government report 
denied  
that security forces beat, insulted, or threatened to rape the boys.  
In a positive development, on February 14, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa ap-
proved Law No. 4/2021  on Child Restorative Justice and Protection from Abuse, 
which raises the age of criminal responsibility from 7 to 15, defines a child as anyone under 18, and provides for specia l child courts and separate detention 
facilities for children. 
Bahrain did not implement the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child’s 2019 
recommendation “to explicitly prohibit the use of 
corporal punishment  in all set-
tings”; the Children’s Act of 2012 does not address corporal punishment. 
Arbitrary Citizenship Revocations  
In 2019, King Hamad reinstated the citizenship of 551 individuals and courts re-
stored the nationality of another 147 individuals. Bahrain amended its citizen-ship revocation laws in 2019, restricting the power to strip nationality to the cabinet. The king and the judiciary no longer have the power to unilaterally strip Bahrainis of their citizenship for national security or terrorism crimes. Citizen-
ship revocations since 2012 had been handed down by the courts, or by royal decree, or by order of the Interior Minist ry. Almost 300 persons whom the au-
70WORLD REPORT 2022thorities had stripped of their citizenship in recent years remained without 
Bahraini nationality, rendering most of them stateless.  
Migrant Workers 
Abuses against migrant workers, especiall y migrant domestic workers, worsened 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the authorities paid  the salaries of 
100,000 citizens working in the private sector between April and June but did not provide similar benefits to migrant workers who comprise most of Bahrain’s workforce. Migrant workers r eported facing dismissal, reduced or unpaid wages, 
and evictions from their accommodation.  
In 2017 , Bahrain introduced a unified stand ard contract for domestic workers 
which requires detailing the nature of the job, rest hours, and days off. But the standard contract does not limit w orking hours, set out the minimum wage or 
specify what rest days workers are entitled to. 
Bahrain 
included  irregular migrants in its Covid-19 vaccination program. 
Women’s Rights, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation 
Bahraini family laws discriminate against women’s right to divorce and inherit. 
Article 353 of the penal code exempts perpetrators of rape from prosecution if they marry their victims. Bahrain’s parliament pr oposed to repeal that article in 
2016, but the cabinet rejected the proposa l. Article 334 of the penal code re-
duces the penalties for perpetrators of so-called honor crimes. 
In August, women launched a 
campaign  with the Arabic hashtag “Citizenship is 
My Right and My Children’s” to demand the right to transmit Bahraini nationality to their children on an equal b asis to men.  
Bahrain’s penal code criminalizes adultery and sexual relations outside mar-
riage, a violation of the right to privacy which disproportionately harms women 
and migrant women. Women who are pregnant outside marriage, as well as women who report rape, can find themselves prosecuted for consensual extra-
marital sex. Although no law explicitly criminalizes same-sex relations, authori-
ties 
have used  vague penal  code pro visions agains t “indecency” and 
“immorality” to target sexual and gender minorities. 
71HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn December 2018, Bahrain amended its labor law  to ban discrimination based 
on sex, origin, language or creed, and sexual ha rassment in the workplace, but 
the law does not refer to sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or age.  
Key International Actors 
Bahrain has not responded to visit request s by the UN special rapporteur on 
human rights defender s sent in 2012 and 2015. Bahrain has also not responded 
to visit request s in recent years by the UN spec ial rapporteurs on torture, free-
dom of expression and freedom of assembly. 
Bahrain continued to participate in Yemen military operations as part of the 
Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which is responsible for serious laws of war viola-tions.  
The US maintains a major naval base in Bahrain. The State Department 
reported  
in June that the US had active arms sales cases with Bahrain worth more than US$6 billion under the Foreign Military Sale s (FMS) program. The United States 
thanked Bahrain for helping evacuate Afghans after the Taliban took over the 
country. In August, the Bahraini government allowed evacuation flights from Afghanistan to land at its airport. 
On March 24, 
22 human rights groups  and unions and 57 British members of par-
liament urged Formula One to conduct an independent inquiry into allegations of human rights abuses associated with the Bahrain Grand Prix, which Bahrain has hosted since 2004.  
In March, the European Parliament adopted a 
resolution  deploring Bahrain’s 
human rights abuses and urging the EU to take a more resolute approach, which is yet to materialize. In April, on the 60th birthday of dual Bahraini-EU jailed human rights defender Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, the EU special representative for 
human rights 
reiterated  a call for his release. 
72WORLD REPORT 2022Bangladesh 
The ruling Awami League government made clear  in 2021  it has no intention of 
addressing a pattern of grave abuses,  including extrajudicial killings, torture, 
and enforced disappearances  by its security forces. Authorities cracked down on 
critics, journalists, and even children  who criticized the government or dared to 
question its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  
In September, Mohib Ullah, 46, a leader among the nearly one million Rohingya 
refugees in Bangladesh documenting the My anmar military’s crimes against the 
Rohingya and advocating for the refugee s’ rights in international forums, was 
shot and killed  by unidentified gunmen in Kutupalong camp in Cox’s Bazar. He 
had faced death threats in recent years for his work. In the month following, Bangladesh authorities failed to ensure security in the camps and 
another seven 
refugees were murdered  in an attack on an Islamic seminary in the camp.  
In October, the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 
UNHCR to begin operations on Bhasan Char island, where Bangladesh authori-ties had already relocated almost 20 ,000 refugees in violation of its commit-
ments to wait for a technical assessment  of habitability, safety, sustainability, 
and protection needs. 
From May to August, Bangladesh saw its 
most deadly wave of Covid-19 infec-
tions  to date. Hospitals were overwhelmed and health care workers reported a 
lack of adequate medical equipment. 
In October, four people died when police reportedly opened fire to contain a 
mob, and at least three more people died amid a spate of sectarian violence  tar-
geting Bangladesh’s Hindu minority. More than 100 are reported injured. 
Disappearances and Extrajudicial Killings 
Bangladesh security forces continue to commit enforced disappearances  and ex-
trajudicial killings with impunity.  
In August, after Human Rights Watch released a report documenting enforced 
disappearances by Bangladesh security forces under the Awami League-led gov-ernment from 2009 to 2020, the government 
denied the findings . Officials also 
73HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH74WORLD REPORT 2022
“Where No Sun Can Enter” 
A Decade of Enforced Disappearances in Bangladesh HUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  denied allegations made during a briefing  held by the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
Commission of the United States House of Representatives. Relatives of some of those forcibly disappeared said that polic e refused to accept any complaint that 
included allegations against law enforc ement and that some families faced 
threats and  harass ment. 
Torture 
In February, writer Mushtaq Ahmed died in prison  after being held in pretrial de-
tention for nine months for posting criticism of the government’s response  to the 
Covid-19 pandemic on Facebook. Ahmed Kab ir Kishore, a cartoonist held on sim-
ilar grounds, filed a legal claim alleging he was tortured  and described the tor-
ture Mushtaq had also faced in custody. 
Law enforcement and intel ligence agencies in Bangladesh, as well as police and 
soldiers seconded into the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), are credibly accused  of 
torture and ill-treatment of detainees and suspects. Despite insisting  that it com-
plies with intern ational law, the government has failed to act on concrete recom-
mendations  from the UN Committee Against Torture to prevent and address 
torture.  
Freedom of Expression and Association 
Human rights defenders continue to be target ed with surveillance, politically 
motivated charges, and arbitrary detention.  
Authorities use the Digital Security Act (DSA) to harass and  indefinitely  detain  
journalists, act ivists, and others critical  of the gov ernment, resulting in a chilling 
effect on expression of dissent. In March, UN High Comm issioner for Human 
Rights Michelle Bachelet called for an overhaul  of the DSA. Instead, the Law Min-
istry approved a proposal  to expand the number of special tribunals specifically 
for these types of cyber “crimes.”  
At least 80 journalists  were reportedly attacked, injured, or killed while perform-
ing their jobs in 2021, as of September. Those who expose government corrup-tion or express dissent are particularly at risk. In May, authorities arrested journalist 
Rozina Islam  following her reporting on malpractices in response to 
75HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthe Covid-19 pandemic. At least 17 journalists , a majority of them photographers, 
were injured covering pr otests over the visit by Indian Prime Minist er Narendra 
Modi in March. During these pr otests, there were also reports  that Facebook and 
Facebook Messenger services were restricted  in Bangladesh.  
Authorities have resorted to targeting the family members  in Bangladesh of criti-
cal activists and jour nalists who are living abroad. With widesp read repression 
of the media, journalists in Bangladesh have taken to self-censoring  at unprece-
dented levels . 
In May, nine organizations wrote to Michelle Bachelet , the UN High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights, raising concerns over continuing attacks on the media, including arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings. 
Covid-19 
Bangladesh reported over 1 million new confirmed cases of Covid-19 and more than 20,000 deaths from January through October 2021. 
Just over 12 percent  of 
the population was fully vaccinated  at time of writing.  
Overburdened hospitals  and a scarc ity of muc h-needed inten sive ca re facilities 
have exacerbated existing disparities in access to healthcare. As of October, 
nearly 10,000 healthcare workers also had tested positive for the virus that 
causes Covid-19, according to the Bangladesh Medical Association. 
At time of writing, schools had been closed for more than 450 days  since the 
pandemic’s start in 2020. Over 1.6 million students were affected, with many facing barriers to accessing remote educ ation, including lack of internet access, 
lack of electricity, and needing to work to support their families. A 
BRAC survey  
found that more than half of students surveyed were not following government-televised class es. Girls in particular faced barrier s to staying in sc hool, and non-
governmental organizations 
reported  a concerning rise in child marriage. 
Women and Girls’ Rights 
According to Bangladeshi human rights organization Ain o Salish Kendra, over 
200 women  were reportedly murdered by their husband or husband’s family in 
2021. Promises by the Bangladesh government  to take sexual and gender-based 
76WORLD REPORT 2022violence seriously rang holl ow, as women and girls face d per vasive sexual vio-
lence while the government  again stal led on pass ing a sexual ha rassment law or 
making amendments to the discriminatory rape law.  
The Bangladesh Policewomen Network launched a strategic plan  for 2021-2023 
to improve gender equality in the police force.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
Same-sex conduct is criminalized in Bangladesh. In August, 6 men were finally convicted for the brutal mu rder of pr ominent Bangl adeshi gay rights  activis ts 
Xulhaz Mannan and Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy in 2016. Yet, five years after the mur-der, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and advocates continued to face violence and threats of vi olence without adequate protection from the po-
lice. 
To encourage employment, the authorities 
announced in June  that companies 
where transgender people make up at least 10 percent of the workforce would be 
given tax breaks. Many who identify as Hijra, Kothi, or transgender in Bangladesh are 
facing economic devastation  amid the pandemic.  
Labor Rights  
In July, 52 workers, most of them women and children as young as 12, died after 
a massive  fire broke out at a factory in Rup ganj, Naray anganj Di strict. Labor ac-
tivists s aid that  police subsequently harassed workers and relatives of the de-
ceased who gathered to protest, and alleged  that police fired rubber bullets and 
tear gas amid clashe s with the protesters. 
In August, international retailers, trade unions, and factory owners signed a new 
agreement  to replace the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety.  
Refugees 
The Bangladesh gov ernment has expressed increasing fr ustration with shoulder-
ing the prolonged hum anitarian crisi s, particul arly as the February coup in Myan-
mar made the prospect of a safe and dignified return for the refugees ever more 
distant. 
77HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH78WORLD REPORT 2022
“An Island Jail in the  
Middle of the Sea” 
Bangladesh’s Relocation of Rohingya Refugees to Bhasan CharHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Instead of working with the UN to shore up resources and improve conditions in 
the refugee camps, the government relocated nearly 20,000 Rohingya refugees 
to remote Bhasan Char island . Refugees on the island face inadequate health-
care, lack of education, and barriers to freedom of movement. While the authori-
ties have said relocation to the island is voluntary, a Human Rights Watch report  
found that many refugees were transferred without full, informed consent and prevented from returning to the mainland  or being reunited with their families in 
Cox’s Bazar. 
Hundreds have attempted to flee the island , and many have died at sea. Others, 
caught trying to escape, have been arreste d and held without charge for long pe-
riods, and some were beaten up  by security forces. 
The main refugee settlement in Cox’s Bazar is sev erely overcrowded, with risks of 
communicable diseases, fires, monsoons , and lack of prevention efforts and 
services for sur vivors of domestic and sex ual violence. Ref ugees faced tightened 
restrictions on their rights to information, movement, and livelihood. Education in camp “learning center s” has been halted since March 2020 due to Covid-19 
lockdowns. 
Bangladesh authorities have prohibited the construction of stronger shelters in 
the camps capable of withstanding not just the annual monsoon, but also fre-quent dry-season fires. In March, 
barbed wire fencing trapped thousands of 
refugees  while a massive fire spread through the camps. The num ber of fires has 
been increas ing at a distur bing rate—in just the first four months  of 2 021 there 
were 84 incidents in the camps , more than in all of 2020.  
Climate Change Policies and Actions 
Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change, despite having cont ributed little to the green house gas emiss ions caus-
ing rising temperatures. Due to climat e change, cyclones will become more in-
tense and frequent, posing a growing threat to  tens of millions of people living 
along the country’s low-lying coastline, many of whom could face food insecurity due to reduced agri cultural pr oductivity and  mass displac ement due to rising 
sea levels.  
79HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHDuring 2021, the government announced a scaling back of plans to build coal-
fired power plants and the cancell ation of numerous pr oposed projects. How-
ever, construction continues on several plants, which, when operational, will not only emit greenhouse gases but also toxi c pollutants that impact the health of 
local populations. The plant under construction at Rampal pose s a serious threat 
to the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest, a UNESCO world her-itage site where rich biodiversity 
supports the livelihood of hundreds of thou-
sands of people  and provides a critical buffer against the impacts of sea level 
rise and extreme weather. 
Key International Actors  
In August, the Guernica 37 Chambers law offices made a formal  submission  to 
the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office recommending sanctions for 15 current and former senior RAB officers for alleged involvement in 
human rights abuses and corrupt practices under the Global Human Rights Sanc-tions Regulations 2020. 
In March 2021, UN High Commiss ioner Bachelet 
affirmed  that “[al]legations of 
torture and ill-treatment by the Rapid Action Battalion have been a long-standing concern.” 
Human Rights Watch addressed 
a letter  to Commonwealth Secretary-General 
Baroness Patricia Scotland calling for her to publicly clarify comments  she made 
praising  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina just days after the death of a dissident 
writer, Mushtaq Ahmed, in custody. 
In February, 13 diplomats expressed grave concern  about Ahmed’s death and 
called for “a swift, transparent, and independent inquiry.” The government re-sponded by 
telling the media  to “stop giving publicity to this sort of nuisance.”  
In February, the Bangladesh chief of army staff, Gen. Aziz Ahmed , met with US 
military officials and high-level UN officials amid the release of a disturbing in-
vestigation by Al Jazeera  alleging involvement of members of the general’s family 
in abuses by Banglad eshi security forces as we ll as the comm ission of grave 
human rights abuses by military units under his command.  
80WORLD REPORT 2022The Al Jazeera investigation documented th at the government had illegally pur-
chased high ly invasive  spyware from Is rael. The military reacted to the evidence  
by saying that the equipment was for an “army contingent due to be deployed in 
the UN peacekeep ing miss ion.” The UN denied that  it was deploying such equip-
ment  with Bangladeshi contingents in peacekeeping operations and called on 
Bangladeshi authorities  to investigate the claims of corruption.  
In August, Israeli digital intelligence agency Cellebrite announced  that it would 
stop selling technology to B angladesh follo wing reports that it was being used 
by RAB.  
Since 2017 , serious shortcomings in Bangladesh’s human and labor rights record 
have jeopardized the trade preferences unilaterally granted by the EU through its 
Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.  
In September, the US announced it would contribute nearly $180 million in addi-
tional hum anitarian assistanc e for Rohingya refugees, Bangladeshi h ost commu-
nities, and the people of Myanm ar in response to the Rohing ya ref ugee cr isis. 
The UN’s Rohingya H umanitarian Cr isis Joint Response Pl an for 2 021 had about a 
third of the funding it needed as of August 31. 
81HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHBelarus 
Mass peaceful protests, which had eru pted across Belarus in response to Presi-
dent Aliaksandr Lukashenko’s manipulation of the August 2020 presidential vote, largely wound down by the end of 2020 due to the government’s relentless 
and vicious crackdown. The authorities, however, escalated smear campaigns and prosecutions  against political and civic activis ts, independent journalists 
and human rights defenders on trumped up , politically motivated charges. In 
July, Lukashenko announced a “p urge” of civi l society, and the authorities went 
on a rampage shutting do wn dozens of  independent mass media outlets  and 
human rights groups, including the most prominent ones in the country.  
At time of writing, at least 862 people were behind bars on politically motivated 
charges. Some of them faced beatings, threats, ill-treatment, and inhumane de-tention conditions. The authorities disbarr ed close to thirty lawyers for repre-
senting victims in politically motivated prosecutions and protesting human 
rights abuses. 
Governmental Crackdown on Peaceful Protests 
When dispersing peaceful pro tests, the authorities, including plain-clothes law 
enforcement officers, resorted to excessive  use of force. Polic e arbitrarily de-
tained people for wearing or exhibiting the white-red-white stripe pattern associ-
ated with the protest movement, at times using brutal force, and charged them with violating rules on public gatherings even if they were detained during raids on apartment buildings.  
According to Human Rights Center “Viasna,” at least 8,712 people were detained 
in connection with the protests between November 2020 and October 2021 and many of them experienced ill-treatment and/or inhuman detention conditions. Courts sentenced more than half of them to administrative fines and short-term 
sentences; at least 850 faced criminal charges. 
In November 2020 , activist Ram an Bandarenka died after a vic ious beating, al-
legedly by plain clothed police officer s or their proxies. The authorities claimed 
the police had found him on the street, drunk and already beaten. There has 
been no effective investigation into his death.  
82WORLD REPORT 2022In March, authorities toughened administrative  sanctions for violating rules on 
public g atherings. In June, a set  of amendments on the law on mass g atherings 
entered into forc e, banning a ll protests without offic ial permission. Later that 
month authorities introduced criminal liability  for joining at least two unautho-
rized protests over a year and toughened sanctions for calls for participation in 
unsanctioned protests and broadly defined extremist crimes. 
In August, the governmental Belarusian Inv estigative Committee completed their 
preliminary inquiry into the allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of peaceful protesters by law enforcement officers in August 2020 and stated that they found no grounds for launching criminal investigations into the 4,644 
claims filed by or on behalf of the alleged victims. 
Freedom of Expression and Attacks on Journalists 
The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) documented 184 cases of arbi-
trary detention, fines, use of exce ssive fo rce against and admini strative arrests 
of journalists between January and mid-November 2021. At time of writing, 26 journalists were behind bars on bogus criminal charges, another two media workers were under house arrest and one sentenced to 18 months of restriction of liberty without imprisonment. 
In May, Belarusian authorities forced down a Ryanair flight on false pretenses of 
a terrorist threat and detained Raman Pr atasevich, former chief-editor of a lead-
ing opposition Telegram channel Next a, which Belarusian authorities had 
banned as “extremist,” and his girlfriend Sofya Sapega, a Russian national. In the weeks following their arrest, governmental broadcasters ran interviews with 
Pratasevich pu rportedly confess ing, evidently under dures s, to or ganiz ing mass 
riots and naming his supposed associates. At time of writing, Pratasevich was under house arrest on charges of “organizing mass riots,” “org anizing activities 
violating public  order,” and “inciting hatred.” Sapega was also under house ar-
rest on charges of  “organiz ing mass riots” and “inciting hatred.” 
During the year, courts sentenced four journalists—Katsiaryna Andreyeva 
(Bakhvalav a), Daria Chultsov a, Katsiaryna Ba rysevich and Si arhei Hard ziyevich—
to prison terms ranging from six to 24 months over their reporting on peaceful protests. 
83HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAuthorities targeted dozens of journalist s as witnesses and suspects in trumped 
up criminal cases and subjected them to house searches, interrogations, and 
harass ment. At least four jour nalists reported beatings and ill-treat ment while in 
custody, including inh umane detention c onditions and deni al of medic al assis-
tance, in reprisal for their work. 
Authorities also cracked down on online medi a outlets that reported on public 
protests and exposed human rights violations. The government stripped them of media licenses, raided their offices and the homes of their employees, blocked 
their websites and banned some of the outlets as extremist. The crackdown on the leading news outlet in the country TUT.by and Poland-based broadcaster Bel-sat was particularly  brutal. Authorities banned  them as extremist  and subjected 
dozens of their employees to searches and detentions under criminal and ad-ministrative charges.  
Belarusian state-owned printing houses refu sed to print at least five independ-
ent newspapers. 
In June, a set of amendments to the la w on mass media entered int o force, fur-
ther expanding official grounds for revok ing accreditations and blocking media 
websites. Amendments prohibite d livestreams  of un authorized mass protests 
and outlawed publications that “discredit” the state, effectively banning all forms of criticism. 
Human Rights Defenders, Civil S ociety Groups, and Lawyers 
In the months following peaceful protests after the 2020 presidential election, 
authorities escalated the crackdown against human rights groups. Human rights defenders and their family  members faced repe ated intrusive  searches, arbitrary 
detention and being held in inhumane detention conditions, beatings, interroga-
tions, smear campaigns, as well as petty and c ruel forms of harass ment. Dozens 
of human rights defenders were jailed on trumped up criminal charges.  
In February, law enforcement officials carried out a nationwide wave of raids tar-
geting human rights defenders and journalists. Authorities claimed the searches of homes and offices were part of their investigation into alleged financing of protests by those organizations. Human rights defender Dzmitry Salauyou was 
84WORLD REPORT 2022severely beaten by law enforcement officers during and immediately after the 
search of his home. 
In July, authorities carried out an even harsher wave of raids, detaining 11 human 
rights defenders. Le ading local human rights  organization Viasna  was hit partic-
ularly hard. At time of writing, the group’s leader Ales Bialiatski, vice-chair 
Valentin Stefanovich, lawyer Uladzimir Lab kovich, and four other members re-
mained behind  bars on trumped up  criminal  charges, including of  “tax evas ion,” 
“actions violating public order,” and “participation in criminal organization.”   
On November 3, court in Homiel sentenced the head of Viasna’s Homieĺ office 
Leanid Sudalenka and Viasna’s volunteer Tatsiana Lasitsa to three and two-and-
a half-yea rs in prison, respectively. 
By mid-November 2021, authorities initiated the process of closing 278 human 
rights groups and organizations, including BAJ. In September, the Belarusian 
Supreme Court upheld the Ministry of J ustice’s lawsuit for the liquidation of the 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee, one of the oldest and most prominent rights 
groups in the country. 
Authorities also shut down the Offi ce for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
the leading disability rights organization in Belarus. Director Siarhei Drazdouski 
and lawyer Aleh Hrableuski spent six months under house arrest and in deten-tion, respectively, on spurious fraud charges. They remain suspects in the case. 
Over the past year, authoritie s have incr easingly target ed lawyers in retaliation 
for speaking out on rights issues or r epresenting clients in politically motivated 
cases. The Ministry of Justice arbitrarily  disbarred or revoked the licenses of at 
least 27 lawyers. Lawyers also faced criminal and administrative charges, 
searches, and  harass ment.  
Authorities violated fundamental due pr ocess protections including interfering 
with the work of lawyers by recor ding their confidential conversations with 
clients and sharing those video recording s with governmental broadcasters, 
forcing them to sign overly broad nondisclosure agreements, arbitrarily denying them access to their clients, and questioning clients without them present. 
In November, amendments to the law on the bar and advocates entered into 
force, requiring all practicing lawyers to be employed by regional bar associa-
85HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtions controlled by the Ministry of Justice, further undermining the independ-
ence of the legal profession in the country.  
Arrest and Harassment of Political Opposition Members and 
Supporters 
Authorities continued to pro secute political oppos ition members and their sup-
porters detained before and after the 2020 presidential elections. 
In July, the Supreme Court sentenced Vi ktar Babarika, one of the former presi-
dential contenders, to 14 years in prison on charges of “grand bribery” and 
“large-scale laundering of illicit fu nds.” In March, authoritie s indicted Siarhei 
Tsikhanouski, also a former presidential c ontender and the husband of Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya, current leading represent ative of political opposition in exile, 
on charges of “ mass riots,” “inciting hatred,” “obstructing the work  of central 
election comm ission,” and “org anizing activities violating pub lic order.” Siarhei 
Tsikhanouski has been detained s ince May 2020 . In September, a Minsk court 
sentenced Maryia Kalesnikava and Maksim Znak, members of the presidium of the opposition’s Coordination Council, to 11 and 10 years’ imprisonment, respec-tively, on charges of “conspiracy to seize power” and “calls for actions aimed at harming nation al security.,” Their tria l was not open to the pub lic. While in pre-
trial detention, Kalesnikava reported threats and ill-treatment.  
Death Penalty 
Belarus remains the only country in Europe to carry out the death penalty. Cur-rently, at least one person, Viktar Syarhel, convicted of murder, is on death row in Belarus.  
In 2021, Belarusian authorities allegedly executed two people. In September, 
state TV channel STV reported the execution of Viktar Skrundzik who had been sentenced to death having been convicted of murder and attempted murder. In 
June,Viktar Paulau, who had been sentenced to death following a convicton for murdering two peop le, was ex ecuted, according to  his sister. However, at time of 
writing, Skrundzik’s and Paulau’s families have received no official confirmation of their respective executions. In Belarus, familie s of executed persons are typi-
86WORLD REPORT 2022cally informed by the authorities about the exec ution several weeks after it had 
taken place. 
In April, Lukashenko granted a “clemency” (replacement of death sentence with 
life imprisonment) to two brothers, Stanislau and Illia Kostseu, who had been on 
death row since January 2020, convicted of murder. This is the second known “act of clemency” in Lukashenko’s 27 years in office.  
In September, Lukashenko said he would consider holding a referendum on the 
death penalty. 
Key International Actors 
In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) condemned the on-going grave violations of human rights in Belarus and tasked the UN high com-miss ioner for human rights—w ith assistanc e from relevant ex perts—to report on 
the situation and collect and preserve evidence of human rights violations. As a result, the Office of the High Comm issioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) appointed 
three experts and set up the OHCHR examination on Belarus to monitor the situ-ation, assess evidence and advance accountability. 
In July, UNHRC extended the mandate of the special rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in Belarus for a period of one year and urged Belarusian authori-ties to cooperate with the mandate. The annual report by the current rapporteur, 
Anaïs M arin, documented  the unprecedented  human rights cr isis in Belarus, in-
cluding police violence against peaceful protesters, cases of enforced disap-
pearance, allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and the repressions against civil soc iety. 
Over the past year, Marin and other UN human rights mandates repeatedly called 
on Belarus to end the excessive u se of force, arrests, arb itrary detention and ill-
treatment against protesters and the rep ression of journalists and media person-
nel. UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the use of force against protesters. 
In March, 14 Belarusian and international human rights organizations launched 
the International Accountability Platform for Belarus with the support of numer-
87HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHous governments. The platform collects evidence of alleged human rights crimes 
in Belarus for future prosecutions. 
Some European states, including Lithuania, German y, Poland, and the Czech Re-
public opened criminal investigations under the principle of universal jurisdic-tion into the gross human rights violations perpetrated by Belarusian authorities.  
In response to the forced landing of the Ryanair flight, Pratasevich’s arrest and 
egregious human rights abuses in Belarus, the European Union, the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and Canada imposed further sanctions against Be-larusian individuals and entities deemed res ponsible for the human rights viola-
tions and repression, as well as targeted economic sanctions.  
The UN Human Rights Office and UN human rights experts expressed outrage 
over the Ryanair flight’s forced landing. Guterres called for a “full, transparent and independent investigation” into the forced landing of the plane and Pratase-vich’s subsequent detention. The European Parliament also adopted a resolu-
tion condemning the forced landing of the flight and the political crackdown in Belarus. EU High Representative Josep Borrell repeatedly criticized the attacks 
against critics of the government, journalists, and protesters. 
In January, the general rapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council 
of Europe (PACE) condemned the death sentence handed down in the case of Skrundzik, calling on Belarus to abolish capital punishment. In June, the EU con-demned the likely execution of Paulau, cal ling for transparency in the Belarusian 
penal system. 
88WORLD REPORT 2022Bolivia 
Political interferenc e has pl agued Bolivi a’s justice system for yea rs. The Jeanine 
Áñez government (November 2019-2020) pu rsued baseless charges against po-
litical opponents. The Luis Arce government (November 2020 to date) supports unsubstantiated and excessive  charges of t errorism and genoc ide against former 
President Áñez, and in February 2021, issued an amnesty for crimes related to the country’s 2019 po litical cr isis that appeared des igned to favor his support-
ers. In response to a report issued in August  by a group of international experts, 
President Arce revoked the amnesty and promised to reform the justice system.  
The international experts documented serious human rights violations during 
the Áñez interim go vernment, including two brut al massacres by sec urity forces 
and acts of violence “instigated” under the preceding government of Evo 
Morales (January 2006-November 2019). They exposed failures by the Attorney General’s Office to conduct adequate inves tigations and ensure accountability 
for these crimes. 
Women and girls remain at high risk of violence. Prison overcrowding and exces-
sive pretrial det ention continue. Indigenous communities face  obstacles to exer-
cise their right under international law to free, prior, and informed consent to measures that may affect them, and are severely affected by fires set by farmers 
that spread to Indigenous lands. 
Judicial Independence 
Former President Evo Morales weakened judicial independence during his al-most 14 years in power. The 2009 constitution empowered voters to elect high court judges from lists created by the Plurinational Assembly; legislators from Morales’ party—the Movement toward Soc ialism (MAS, in Spanish)—packed the 
lists with its supporters. In 2010, a ll judges appointed before 2009 were deemed 
“temporary.” Scores were summarily removed. 
During Morales’ government, pro secutors filed what appe ared to be politically 
motivated charges against several of his political rivals. 
89HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAbout 80 percent of judges and pro secutors remain “t emporary,” heightening 
the risk that, in order to  remain in their pos itions, they wi ll issue decisions  to 
please the authorities. 
To further its interests, the government of President Áñez publicly pressured 
prosecutors and judges, le ading to criminal investigations, many apparently po-
litically motivated, of more than 150 people linked to the Morales government, for sedition, terrorism, or members hip in a criminal organization. 
After winning the October 2020 presidential  election, Luis Arce, from MAS, said 
the justice system should be independent from politics. In November 2020, he 
established a commission of experts to propose reforms. 
However, in February 2021, President Arce decreed an amnesty that opened the 
door to impunity for serious crimes and appe ared designed to favor his support-
ers. In March, authorities detained Áñez and two of her former ministers on ter-
rorism and other charges for their al leged participation in a coup against 
Morales in November 2019. In August, the attorney general accused Áñez of genocide in connection with two massacres that occu rred during her govern-
ment. Human Rights Watch examined the charging documents and did not find evidence that she had committed terrorist acts or genocide. 
Áñez remained in pretrial detention as of  November 3. In August, the United Na-
tions Office in Bolivia called on the government to provide suicide prevention and other services to ensure her health. 
Also in August, the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI, in 
Spanish), which was established u nder a government  agreement w ith the Inter-
American Comm ission on Hum an Rights, issued a report expos ing the lack of in-
dependence in the judicial system. In response, the Arce administration revoked the February 2021 amnesty decree. In October, his government signed an agree-ment with UN agencies to reform the justic e system that includes receiving rec-
ommendations from national and international experts.  
Protest-Related Violence and Abuses  
The GIEI report documented the deaths of 37 people in the context of protests 
over contested October 2019 elections. It concluded that, during the Áñez gov-
90WORLD REPORT 2022ernment, security forces had executed  20 pro-Morales protesters and injured 
more than 170 people in massacres in Sacaba (Cochabamb a) and Senkata (La 
Paz). The report provided robust  evidence of illegal detentions, sexual violence, 
and “systematic” torture by police forces in the predominantly Indigenous city of El Alto, as well as other abuses throughout the country. It also asserted that the police had failed to protect people from violence committed by both pro- and 
anti-Morales supporters, and in some locations it had encouraged and collabo-rated with violent groups of anti-Morales supporters that acted as “para-police” 
forces. The report also documented acts  of violence “instigated” by the Morales 
administration, such as injuries, abductions, and torture of anti-Morales protest-ers.  
The GIEI highlighted major flaws in the in vestigations into those abuses and 
called on the Attorney General’s Office to reopen cases it had closed without tak-ing important investigative  steps.  
Authoritarian-Era Abuses  
Bolivia has only pro secuted a few of the officia ls responsib le for human rights vi-
olations committed under authoritarian governments between 1964 and 1982, partly because the armed forces have at times refused to share information. 
A truth comm ission created in 2016 presented its  final report to President Arce in 
March 2021, documenting killings, forced disappearances, and torture during that period, allegedly by state agents. The 11 -volume report calls for the prosecu-
tion of those responsible. As of November 3, only the executive summary was available online. 
Covid-19  
Bolivia had more than half-a-million confirmed Covid-19 cases and nearly 
20,000 deaths as of October 27 , although government data is likely to signifi-cantly undercount deaths. About 30 percent of the population had been fully vaccinated and an additional 29 percent had received one shot of a two-dose 
vaccine, as of October 27. 
91HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe Áñez government closed schools in March 2020. In August, it cancelled the 
rest of the school year, which was sc heduled to end in December. Classes 
restarted in February 2021, mostly online. Thousands of students could not ac-cess classes for lack of devices or int ernet. By September , 77 percent of schools 
had resumed some in-per son class es, the gov ernment said. 
Detention Conditions  
In April 2020, to reduce severe prison ov ercrowding in response to Covid-19, the 
Áñez administr ation issued a decree releas ing certain categories of detainee s. In 
February 2021, the Arce administration issued a similar decree. The decrees led to the release of 1,162 and 787 detainees, respectively, by July 2021, the Om-budsperson’s Office said.  
However, the impact on the total n umber of people in detention has been very 
small. Bolivian prisons and jails held 18,126 people in January 2020; 17 ,863 peo-ple in February 2021; and 17 ,908 in August  2021. Detention cent ers hold more 
than 2.5 times more detainees than they were  built to accommodate, making so-
cial distancing virtually impossible.  
Bolivia’s j ustice system continues to  use pretrial  detention exce ssively. Sixty-five 
percent of detainees are awaiting trial,  the Ombudsperson’s Office reported. 
In November 2020, the Ombudsperson’s Office documented overcrowding in 4 
of Bolivia’s 16 juvenile detention centers, and inadequate access to health care, 
education, and sanitation.  
Freedom of Expression and Access to Information  
The GIEI report documented dozens  of physical attacks against journalists by po-
lice, soldiers, and demonstrators during the 2019 election-related protests. The 
report concluded authorities had failed to conduct adequate investigations of 
these attacks.  
The National Press Association, which r epresents the country’s main print 
media, reported several cases of vio lence by police or demonstrators against re-
porters in 2021. 
92WORLD REPORT 2022In August 2021, the government accused media outlets of “lying” and serving 
foreign interests, and singled out sever al newspapers because of their criticism 
of the administration. The National Press Association rejected the accusations and defended freedom of the press. 
The constitution asserts the right of access to information, but Bolivia lacks a 
law to implement that right. The go vernment said  it was w orking on an a ccess to 
information bill but had not presented it  as of November 3, 2021. Comunidad 
Ciudadana, the largest opposition party in Congress, introduced its own bill in 
February.  
Indigenous Rights  
The 2009 cons titution includes compr ehensive  guarantees of  Indigenous peo-
ples’ rights to collect ive land titling, intercul tural educ ation, prior consultation 
on development projects, and protection of Indigenous justice systems. 
Yet Indigenous peoples continue to face barrier s to exercise their right to free, 
prior, and informed consent regarding measures that may affect them. 
The Center for Legal Studies and Socia l Research (CEJIS), a Bolivian non-govern-
mental organization, estimates that more than 5 million hectares of land in In-digenous territories in the Amazon and other lowland ecosystems—about 42 
percent of such territ ories—were burned between 2010 and  2020. CEJIS reported 
that farmers set the fires to clear land near the Indigenous territories, a practice 
facilitated by legislation that extended the area of the Amazon Forest available for agricul tural use, granted amnesties f or illegal  deforestation, and only estab-
lished a small fine for setting fires without a permit.  
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Women and girls remain at high risk of violence, despite a 2013 law establishing comprehen sive measures to  prevent and  prosecute gender-ba sed violence. The 
law created the crime of “femicide,” which it defines as the killing of a woman under certain circumstances, including domestic violence. 
The attorney general reported 113 femic ides in 2020—a 3 percent drop from 
2019—and 95 from January through October 31, 2021. 
93HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUnder Bolivian law, abortion is not a crime when a pregnancy results from rape 
or it is necessary to protect the life or health of a pregnant woman or girl. How-
ever, most staff interviewed by the Ombudsperson’s Office in 39 health centers 
that should perform abortions in those ci rcumstances either did not know the re-
quirements for a legal abortion or cited more requirements than those provided 
for by the law. In addition, half of those c enters lacked adequate facilities to per-
form abortions and 77 percent lacked multidisc iplinary teams mandated by law.   
Sexual Orientation 
In December 2020 , the national  civil registry abided by a court order and regis-
tered a gay couple’s relationship as a “free union.” In June 2021, however, it de-nied the same right to a l esbian couple, which has since fi led an adminis trative 
appeal. The gay couple’s case is pending before the Constitutional Court, which is expected to determine whether a ll same-sex couples can join in “free unions.” 
Key International Actors  
In 2017 , Bolivia’s Constitutional Court revoked the existing constitutional limit on 
reelection, arguing that it violated the human rights of then-President Evo Morales. In August 2021, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued an ad-visory opinion requested by Colombia, whic h concluded that barring unlimited 
presidential reelection did not violate human rights but rather ensured plurality and prevented the perpetuation of pow er in the hands of one person. Although 
not binding, the court’s advisory opinions are authoritative interpretations of re-
gional human rights law.   
In December 2020, Bolivia, along with Mexico, voted against an Organization of 
American States (OAS) resolution condemning “fraudulent” elections in Venezuela. In March 2021, Bolivia voted against a UN Human Rights Council res-olution urging Nicaragua to repeal or amend legislation that may unduly restricts freedom of expression and association. In June, it voted against an OAS resolu-tion calling on Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s government to release ille-gally detained presidential opposition candid ates, and in October it abstained 
from another OAS resolution making the same call.  
94WORLD REPORT 2022Bosnia and Herzegovina  
There was little visible progress on human rights in Bosnia  and Herzegovina 
(BiH) in 2021. Public officials stirred x enophobia, failed to tackle discrimination, 
and put pressure on journalists. War crimes prosecutions slowed. Protections for 
women and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are inade-
quate. 
Discrimination and Intolerance 
In December 2020, the first local elections in 12 years were held in Mostard. Due to disagreements about election law among the main ethnic parties, voters last had the chance to elect the city government in 2008. Additional disagreements between the main parties meant it took two additional months and a joint inter-vention by diplomats before the city council elected a new mayor. 
In March 2021, the Council of Europe 
Committee of Ministers  criticized the 11-
year failure of political leaders in BiH to implement a European Court of Human Rights ruling to amend the constitution and election laws to end political dis-crimination against Jews, Roma, and others. 
In April, the Roma Information Center, Kali Sara, reported that 
Roma  were espe-
cially impacted during the Covid-19 p andemic because about 35-40 percent had 
no insurance needed to access health care. In the 2020/21 school year, Roma, people living in poverty, and childr en with disabilities experienced greater 
ob-
stacles  in accessing online education due to lack of devices, reliable internet, 
and special assistance. 
A June European Parliament resolution  called on the government to adopt a de-
institutionalization strategy for people with disabilities and condemned a law al-
lowing them to be deprived of their legal capa city, or the right to  make decisions 
for themselves. 
In July, the Constitutional Court of BiH found  the practice of “two schools under 
one roof” discriminates against children bec ause it physically segregates chil-
dren at school based on ethnicity.  
95HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) recorded  98 
hate crimes between January and August 2021, mainly based on ethnicity or reli-gion. At time of writing, there were seven ongoing trials against perpetrators. 
Accountability for War Crimes  
The Revised National War Crimes Processing Strategy adopted in 2020 called for the most serious war crimes to be processed by the end of 2023. However, in 2021, the OSCE 
documented  a decline in the number of prosecuted cases gener-
ally. In the first six months of 202 1, the state prosecutor indicted only two people 
for war c rimes, one of whom was already in prison.  
As of August, 250 war crimes cases involving 502 defendants were pending be-
fore courts in BiH, according to the OSCE. A lack of willingness  in the region to 
extradite those on war crimes charges means that 80 of the defendants  outside 
of BiH cannot be brought to trial.  
According to the OSCE, in the first six months of 2021, courts in BiH rendered 
first instance judgments in 12 cases against 22 defendants, of whom 14 were 
found guilty.  In the same period, 5 cases against 10 defendants ended with final 
judgments being rendered, and 10 found guilty. 
There are currently 57 pending cases ag ainst 125 defendants involving allega-
tions of conflict-related sexual violence. In the first six months of 2021, first in-stance judgments were rendered in 4 cases against 8 defendants, of whom 3 
were convicted, and 1 final judgment  was r endered with 1 defendant convicted 
before Court of BiH. 
The Bosnian 
state  failed again to financially compensate a woman raped in the 
war as recommended by the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT) in 2019. 
In June, an appeals panel of the International  Residual Mechanism for Criminal 
Tribunals upheld  the 2017 genocide conviction and life sentence of Bosnian Serb 
wartime military commander Ratko Mladić. 
The same month, in a p ress release by the United  Nations High C ommiss ioner 
for Human Rights and the UN special adviser on prevention of genocide, the spe-cial adviser 
warned  against increas ing glorification of co nvicted war crimin als in 
Bosnia.  
96WORLD REPORT 2022Asylum Seekers and Migrants  
The Service for Foreigner’s Affairs between January and August registered 10,075 
irregular arrivals with 9,057 persons exp ressing an intention to apply for asylum; 
a slight decrease compared to the same period in 2020. 
According to the UN Refugee Agency  (UNHCR), in the first half of 2021, 67 per-
sons submitted a sylum applications  and 31 were  issued de cisions, with 1 
granted refugee status, and 4 subs idiary protection. Aver age processing time 
nearly doubled since 2018, from 223 to 419 days in 2021. According to UNHCR , 
this has led many people to abandon the pr ocess before a decision is issued.  
Five state-operated reception centers are mostly overcrowded and around 1,500 
migrants had to be accommodated elsewhere. Routine  violent pushbacks into 
Bosnia by Croatian police exacerbate the poor situation  for migrants, who often 
depend on civil society  for medical care and basic needs.  
Hostility  against migrants  was amp lified during the local  elections with some 
mayoral candidates in border towns running on an anti-migrant and refugee plat-form. People working on migration issues faced 
attacks  and threats . 
Domestic and Other Gender-Based Violence  
After delays and criticism by the EU Delegation  in Bosnia, the Federation of BiH 
entity adopted  a draft law on protection from dom estic violence. The draft was 
sent for a 60-day public discussion at the time of writing.  
Ombudswoman Jasminka Dzumhur stated  in March 2021 that criminal legislation 
in Bosnia does not align with obligations to combat gender-based violence in the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Do-mestic Violence, known as Istanbul Convention, which Bosnia ratified in 2013.  
The 
European Parliament  in September urged the Bosnian authorities to harmo-
nize and implement legislation in line with the Istanbul Convention . The body re-
sponsible for monitoring compliance with the Istan bul Conv ention visited B osnia 
in October to evaluate its implementation. 
97HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Research published in June by the Sarajevo Open Center, an LGBTI and women’s 
rights group, found that lesbian, gay,  bisexual, transgender and  intersex people 
face discrimination in education, employment, and housing. According to the Ombuds Office 
report in May , there has not been much concrete  progre ss in en-
suring equality for people in s ame-sex partnerships.  
The third Sarajevo Pride march went without incident  despite an anti-LGBT 
protest on the same day. In 2021, local cantonal government provided over US$15,000 for security during the event, a cost 
march organizers  previously had 
to cover. 
Between January and September 2021, the Sarajevo Open Center recorded seven 
hate incidents against LGBTI people, two of which were physical attacks. 
Freedom of Media 
According to information provided to Human Rights Watch by the journalists’ as-
sociation BH Novinari, between January and Ju ly 2021, there were 42 threats 
against journali sts, of which one was a physical att ack. BH Novin ari recorded 
several complaints from journalists ag ainst police and officials in Lipa migrant 
camp including threats, improper denial of access and forcing journalists to delete recorded material . An employee of the Ministry for Human Rights and 
Refugee s was 
disciplined  for threatening a journalist.  
A September survey by BH Novinari invo lving 440 media professionals showed 
that in the last three years, over 40 per cent of respondents indicated they had 
been subject to threats and intimidation, in most cases by politicians and public officials. 
Following 
smears  against journalist Tanja Topic by the Chairman of the BiH Presi-
dency Milorad Dodik in May 2021, diplomats in Bosnia called  on public officials 
to refrain from threats and misogynistic  comments against media professionals.  
BH Novinari registered  increased gender-based vi olence against women in the 
media, with 70 incidents over five year s, including death threats, verbal and 
physical threats, and discrimination at work.
98WORLD REPORT 2022Brazil 
President Jair Bolson aro has threa tened democratic  rule in Braz il by attempting 
to undermine trust in the electoral sy stem, free speech, and judicial independ-
ence. In a forceful response, the Supreme Court in 2021 rejected “threats to its independence and intimidation.” 
President Bolsonaro continued to flout scientific recommendations to prevent 
the spread of the Covid-19 virus. A congressional investigation uncovered evi-dence of corruption in the purchase of vaccines.   
Police killings reached the highest number on record in 2020. About 80 percent 
of the victims were Black. 
Deforestation continued to ravage the Amazon rainforest. Indigenous people 
and others who defended it suffered threats and attacks.  
Threats to Democratic Rule  
President Bolson aro has harassed and tried to intimid ate the Supreme Court, 
which is overseeing four criminal inv estigations into his conduct, including 
whether he interfered with federal police appointments to further his personal interests and whether he committed malfeasance in a corruption case involving the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.  
In August 2021, he threatened to respond  to the investigations with actions “not 
within the bounds of the constitution” and as ked the Senate to impeach Justice 
Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing most of them. The Senate president re-jected the petition.  
In September, President Bolsonaro said he would not obey Justice Moraes’ deci-
sions. The Supreme Court responded that insulting justices and encouraging non-compliance with judic ial decisions “are anti-democratic, il legal, and intoler-
able practices.” President Bolsonaro later retracted his statement about Justice 
Moraes. 
President Bolson aro has sought to di scredit Br azil’s elect oral syst em, making 
unproven claims of electoral fraud. Cong ress rejected changes he promoted to 
99HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthe system. He later signaled that he might try to cancel elections unless his pro-
posals are implemented. 
Freedom of Expression and Access to Information  
The Bolsonaro administration has pursued pri son sentences against at least 17 
critics, including by using a military-era Nation al Security Law. Although many of 
the cases have been closed, such actions send the message that criticizing the president can lead to persecution.  
In August 2021, Congress re voked the National Sec urity Law, but it has not re-
voked similar penal  code pro visions that  punish defamation with prison terms 
and can be used to  stifle free speech.  
President Bolson aro harassed and  insulted the media and individual r eporters 
87 times during the first half of 2021, Reporters without Borders, a nongovern-mental organization (NGO), reported.  
He routinely blocks critics on the social media accounts he uses to discuss mat-
ters of public interest, violating their free speech rights. In September 2021, he issued a decree that would have impeded social media platforms from eliminat-ing harmful misinformation. After the Senat e rejected the decree and the 
Supreme Court suspended it, he sent a bill with s imilar pro visions to Congress.  
In February 2021, the Bolsonaro adminis tration created a working group—with-
out participation fr om Congress, judicia l authorities, or civil society—t o propose 
changes to the National Human Rights Program, the most important instrument of human rights policy in Brazil. The government told Human Rights Watch it could not provide information about these discussions because they were se-cret.  
Covid-19 
Brazil had 21 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and 609,447 deaths as of Novem-ber 7—the second largest death toll in the world in absolute numbers. 
President Bolsonaro continued to flout World Health Organization (WHO) recom-
mendations and to promote ineffective drugs against Covid-19. The Supreme 
Court rejected two petitions he had filed to strike down decrees by governors 
100WORLD REPORT 2022that established social distancing measures. At an event in June 2021, the presi-
dent, who frequently joins crowds without a mask, asked a child to remove her mask, and took off another child’s mask. 
A congressional inquiry into the Covid-1 9 response found that the federal gov-
ernment and local  officials had failed to ensure pro vision of ox ygen to hospitals 
in Amazonas st ate, leading to doz ens of de aths in January 2021. It  also found ev-
idence of corruption in the purchase of vaccines and other failures in the govern-ment response. 
The Brazilian gov ernment has failed to  address the huge impact of  the Covid-19 
pandemic on education. Brazilian schools were mostly closed for 69 weeks be-
tween March 2020 and August 2021 due to Covid-19, UNESCO reported. Lack of access to adequate devices and internet connectivity necessary for online edu-cation excluded millions of children fr om schooling, particularly Black and In-
digenous children, and those from low-income households.  
Detention Conditions 
The cramped quarters, poor ventilation, and inadequate health care services 
prevalent in Brazil’s detention c enters created an increased risk of Covid-19 out-
breaks. As of December 2020, about 670,000 adults were being held in jails and prisons, exceeding maximum capacity by 47 percent, and another 139,000 were under house arrest, the Justice Ministry reported. In February 2021, the National Mechanism for the Prevention and Combat of Torture (MNPCT, in Portuguese) re-ported up to 13 people were being held in cells designed for one person in a prison in Acre state.  
Since 2020, the National Council of J ustice (CNJ, in Portuguese), which regulates 
the judicial syst em, has re commended that  judges reduce pret rial detention dur-
ing the pandemic and consider house arrest or early release for certain de-tainees.  
Yet a study by the NGO Institute for the Defense of the Right to a Defense (IDDD, 
in Portuguese) showed that São Paulo state judges only released 1 out of 4 de-
tainees who met the CNJ’s conditions in 2020. 
101HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe state of São Paulo told Human Rights Watch that about 9,800 detainees had 
been released in response to the pandemic up to September 2021. 
More than 92,800 detainees and staff had contracted Covid-19 and 582 had died 
as of October 31, the CNJ reported. The MNPCT said the number of deaths is likely an underestimate. 
The government told Human Rights Watch that about 10,500 children and young 
adults were being held in juvenile detention centers as of September 2021, but 
the figure excludes five states for which it did not have data. More than 2,900 children and about 8,400 staff had been inf ected with Covid-19 as of October 31, 
the CNJ reported. The virus had killed 113 staff but no children. 
Public Security and Police Conduct 
After two years in decline, the number of homicides rose almost 5 percent in 
2020.  
Police killed more than 6,400 people in 2020—the last year for which data is 
available—the highest number of any year on record, the NGO Brazilian Forum for Public Security (FBSP in Portuguese) reported.  
While some police killings ar e in self-defense, many result from illegal use of 
force. Police abuses contribute to a cycle of violence that undermines public se-curity and  endangers the lives of civili ans and police alike. In 2020 , 194 police 
officers were killed, 72 percent while off duty, the FBSP reported. 
In March 2021, Rio de Janeiro’s new attorney general dissolved the prosecutor 
unit specialized in police abuse. Despite  a Supreme Court ruling that only al-
lowed raids in Rio’s impoverished  neighborhoods during the pandemic in “ex-
ceptional cases,” police conducted the deadliest raid in the state’s history on May 6, leaving an officer and 27 residents dead. Witnesses said police executed at least three suspects and dest royed c rime scene evidence. Polic e class ified the 
report and other important information about the raid as secret for five years. Media reported that police refused to provide the victims’ clothing to prosecu-
tors, forcing them to seek a judicial order to  search police facilities. In October, 
prosecutors charged two officers with tampering with crime scene evidence, and 
one of them with homicide. 
102WORLD REPORT 2022Rio police killed 1,096 people from Januar y through September 2021, a 17 per-
cent increase from the same period in 2020.  
On-duty police in São Paulo killed 353 people from January through September, 
a 39 percent decrease. In June, the Superior Co urt of Justice reinstated the con-
victions against 73 police for the 1991 killing of 111 inmates in Carandiru prison, which a São Paulo court had overturned in 2018. 
Military-Era Abuses 
President Bolsonaro and members of his ca binet have repeatedly praised the 
military dictators hip of 1964-1 985, which  was marked by widesp read torture and 
killings. 
A 1979 amnesty law has s hielded perpe trators from justice. The Supreme Court 
upheld the law in 2010, but the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that it violated Brazil’s international legal obligations. 
Since 2010, federal prosecutors have brought charges against about 60 former 
agents of the dictatorship. Courts have dismissed most cases, citing either the amnesty law or the statute of limitations. But in June 2021, in a case involving the enforced disappearance of a naval officer who opposed the 1964 coup, a judge issued the first criminal conviction of an agent of the dictatorship, ruling that kidnapping is not subject to the amnesty law. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
About 30 trans people were elected to office in the 2020 local elections—up from only 8 in 2016. Several reported thr eats after taking office in 2021, includ-
ing a Rio de Janeiro councilwoman who had to leave the country temporarily. 
The national Human Rights Ombudsperson’s Office received about 1,100 com-
plaints of violence, discrimination, and other crimes against lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual, and transgender (LGBT) persons between January and October 2021. In Ceará state, two trans girls, aged 13 and 16, were brutally killed in January and April.  
103HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen’s and Girls’ Rights 
The adoption of the 2006 “Maria da Penha” law against gender-based violence 
was an important step, but implementation has l agged.  
In 2020, more than one million cases of  domestic violence and about 5,500 
cases of femicide—defined under Brazilian law as the killing of women “on ac-count of being persons of the fem ale sex”—were pending bef ore the courts.  
Reports of attacks against women resulting in injuries filed at police stations fell 
7 percent in 2020, while calls to a po lice hotline to report domestic violence in-
creased 16 percent, suggesting women ma y have had difficulty going to police 
stations during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, 3,913 women were reported killed, about the same number as in 2019. 
Abortion is legal in Brazil only in cases of rape, to save a woman’s life, or when 
the fetus has anencephaly, a condition that makes sur vival difficult.  
Only 42 hospitals were performing legal abortions in 2020, the NGO Article 19 
and the news websites AzMina and Gênero e Nú mero reported, compared to 76 
in 2019.  
The Health Ministry issued a regulation allowing telemedicine during the pan-
demic, but in a later “informative note,” it called on health providers to exclude 
abortion care. Some health professionals were still providing such care as of Oc-tober.  
Women and girls who have unsafe and illegal abortions not only risk injury and 
death but face up to three years in prison, while people who perform illegal abortions face up to four years in prison.  
Disability Rights 
Thousands of adults and children w ith disabilities are confined in institutions, 
where they may face neglect and abuse, sometimes for life. Brazil lacks a com-
prehen sive pl an to progre ssively deinstitution alize adults and childr en with dis-
abilities. 
104WORLD REPORT 2022In April 2021, the National Council of Prosecutor’s Offices, a government body, 
adopted a resolution requiring p rosecutors to oversee and inspect institutions 
for adults with disabilities yearly and take legal action in cases of abuse. 
In August, the Minister of Education defended a new national policy that ap-
peared to be aimed at establishing segregat ed schools for certain children with 
disabilities, arguing they “disturbed” other students. As of September, the 
Supreme Court was ex amining whether the policy  is cons titutional. 
Indigenous Rights 
President Bolsonaro and his allies in C ongress promoted a bill to prevent Indige-
nous peoples from obtaining legal rec ognition of their traditional lands if they 
were not physically present on them on October 5, 1988—when Brazil’s constitu-
tion was enact ed—or if they had not , by that dat e, initiated legal proceedings to 
claim them. A case simi larly seek ing to block Indigenous land rights  was pend-
ing before the Supreme Court, as of November 2021.  
Meanwhile, Indigenous territ ories continued to suffer illegal encroachment. The 
area occupied by illegal mining grew five-fold from 2010 to 2020, the NGO Map Biomas r eported.  
“Wildcat” miners sought to impede a law enforcement operation in Munduruku 
Indigenous territories and attacked a Mu nduruku women’s association and a 
leader’s home in May 2021. In the Yanomami Indigenous territory, miners fired at 
Indigenous people and Federal Police in several incidents. Two Yanomami chil-dren who escaped a shooting alone were found drowned in May, and a plane used by miners hit and killed an Indigenous man in July.  
Environment 
Since taking office in January 2019,  the Bolsonaro admini stration has weak ened 
environmental law enforc ement, effectively encouraging criminal networks that 
are driving deforestation and have used thr eats and violence against forest de-
fenders. The average number of fines f or deforestation in the Amazon paid in 
2019 and 20 20 was 93 percent lower th an the average n umber paid in the previ-
ous five years, a study by the Federal  Univers ity of Mi nas Gerais showed.   
105HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHBetween August 2020 and July 2021, 1 3,235 square kilometers of Amazon rain-
forest were clear-cut, a 22 percent increase over the same period last year and the highest number since 2006. Brazil’s space research agency had its defor-estation report ready on October 27 , four  days before the COP26 climate summit 
in Glasgow, but the government only rel eased it on November 18, after the sum-
mit ended, in an apparent attempt  to preclude criticism. 
In deforested areas, criminal groups oft en set remaining vegetation ablaze after 
they have extracted valuable timber, in order to clear land for pasture or land speculation. A study by InfoAmazônia and other organizations said smoke from forest fires, which can cause respiratory diseases and make people vulnerable to complications from Co vid-19, was linked to an 18 percent increase in serious 
Covid-19 cases in the Amazon during the fire season in 2020.   
The government promoted bills that would encourage deforestation by providing 
amnesty for land in vasions, easing envi ronmental licensing, and opening Indige-
nous territories to mining and  other projects with high environmental impact. 
In response to criticism, the government announced in September 2021 that it 
would hire hundreds of new staff at its  federal environmental agencies. But the 
Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental NGOs, warned that only 157 of them would be agents with university degrees who have the mandate to lead en-vironmental law enforcement operations. 
Climate Change Policy and Impacts 
As one of the world’s top 10 emitters of gr eenhouse gases, Brazil contributes to 
the mounting to ll that the clim ate crisis is tak ing on human rights around the 
globe. 
In its December 2020 climate action plan, Brazil pledged a smaller reduction of 
its overall gr eenhouse gas emissions th an it had in its origin al 2016 plan, a re-
gression in violation of its obligations under the Paris Agreement. The Climate Action Tracker, which prov ides independent sc ientific anal ysis, rated th at plan 
as “highly insufficient” to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. If all countries’ plans fell this short, warming 
would reach over 4°C by the end of the century. 
106WORLD REPORT 2022In November 2021, the Brazilian delegation to the global climate summit in Glas-
gow, COP26, announced a new plan that st ill does not represent an increase in 
ambition in relation to its initial pl an submitted in 2016. The delegation also 
committed to ending illegal deforestation by 2028, but the federal government is yet to adopt an operational plan to deliver on this pledge. 
Increased deforestation in the Amazon en abled by the Bolsonaro government 
has driven up overa ll emissions and may cause vast portions of the r ainforest to 
turn into dry savann ah in coming years, releasing bil lions of t ons of stored car-
bon.  
Migrants, Refugees, and Asylum Seekers 
Thousands of Venezuelans, including unacc ompanied children, have crossed 
the border into Brazil in recent years, fleeing hunger, lack of basic health care, or 
persecution. About 261,000 Venezuelans lived in Brazil as of October 2021. 
In June 2019, Brazil issued a legal recognition of “serious and widespread viola-
tion of human rights” in Venezuela, which make s it easier for V enezuelans  to ob-
tain asylum. Brazil granted refugee status to about 50,000 Venezuelans from June 2019 to June 2021.  
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Brazil barred foreign n ationals from enter-
ing the country by land or water, except for permanent residents and some other foreigners with li nks to Brazil, who could still enter fr om all countries but 
Venezuela. In June 2021, the government started allowing the entrance of perma-nent residents and some other foreigners coming from Venezuela.  
The government ordered the deportation of people who entered Brazil in viola-
tion of border restrictions, even if they intended to seek asylum, an infringement of Brazil’s international obligations. Federal police told Human Rights Watch they deported 2,091 people in 2020—compared to only 36 in 2019—and 1,198 from January through July 2021. 
In September 2021, Brazil announced that it would issue humanitarian visas al-
lowing Afghans to travel to Brazil and  apply for temporary residency or refugee 
status, but Braz ilian media reported th at embassies required prior proof  that an 
organization would pay for all their expenses for at least six months. Brazil has 
107HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHnot committed to resettling Afghan refugee s on its territory or to assis ting with 
the humanitarian response in Afghanistan and neighboring countries.  
Key International Actors 
In June 2021, the UN high c ommiss ioner for human rights highlight ed police vio-
lence in Brazil in a landmark report to the UN Human Rights Council, urging countries to take steps toward eradicating systemic racism against people of African descent and to hold po lice accountable for abuses. 
The high comm issioner also expressed c oncern about thre ats against Brazil’s 
Supreme Court. In September 2021, the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee and three other senators called on the administration of US 
President Joe Biden to support Brazil’s democratic institutions in response to President Bolsonaro’s threats of “a rup ture with Brazil’s constitutional order.” 
Also in September, the UN Committ ee on Enforced Disappearances asked Brazil 
to ensure justice for enforced disappe arances during the military dictatorship 
and to prosecute all cases, including current  ones, befor e civi lian courts.   
Throughout 2021, the high comm issioner , several  UN rapporteurs, and the Inter-
American Comm ission on Hum an Rights denounced  illegal  encroac hment into 
Indigenous territories and attac ks against Indigenous people.  
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development cancelled a dis-
cussion about upgrading Brazil’s status  in its environment committee because 
of President Bolsonaro’s poor environment al record. Several European leaders 
said they would not ratify a pending trade agreement between the European Union and Mercosur unless Brazil reduced Amazon deforestation and forest fires. The Europe an Comm ission is negotiating an additional  instrument  with 
Mercosur to address deforestation. 
In April 2021, 15 US senat ors urged Pres ident Biden to condition financia l assis-
tance to Brazil on reducing deforest ation and ending impunity for environmental 
crimes and attacks against forest defenders.  
108WORLD REPORT 2022Foreign Policy 
In international forums, Brazil continued to oppose references to “sexual and re-
productive” rights.  
At the UN Human Rights Council, Brazil abstained from a resolution to launch an 
investigation into crimes committed during the conflict between Israel and 
Hamas in Gaza. Brazil  also opposed a WHO resolution to p rovide health support 
to Palestinians, including Covid-19 vaccines. 
At the World Trade Organization, Brazil opposed waiving certain intellectual 
property rights to increase Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing and allow fairer ac-cess for low-income countries; in June 2021, authorities indicated they might re-
assess that position. 
In May 2021, Brazil ratified the Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance. 
109HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHBurkina Faso 
During 2021, ther e was a m arked deterior ation in Burkin a Faso’s h uman rights 
and security situation as attacks and atroc ities by armed Islamist groups surged, 
unlawful killing s by state security forces and pro-go vernment mi litias during 
counterterrorism operations continued, and the humanitarian situation wors-ened.  
The government of President Roch Marc Kaboré, elected in November 2020 to a 
second term , struggled during 2021 to address the overlapping crises. The vio-
lence, including the Ju ne massacre  of over 1 35 civi lians in Solhan,  the single 
deadliest attack in the country since the outbreak of armed conflict in 2016, led to 
demonstrations  calling for an end to the bloo dshed. Sever al activis ts and 
members of the political opposition were questioned or detained after criticizing 
the government’s response to the growing insecurity. 
There was scant progress toward providing justice for the al leged killing s of hun-
dreds of suspects during past security forces operations, though a few trials of crimes by alleged Islamist fighters took place. Rule-of-law institutions remained weak; however, the government took steps to reduce the numbers of suspects in pre-trial detention.  
Attacks by armed groups caused over 
237 ,000 people  to flee their homes in 
2021, bringing the total number of internally displaced people since 2016 to over 
1.4 million , or 6 percent of the population. The government struggled to care for 
the growing number of displaced. 
A 2019 law criminalizing some aspects of reporting on security force operations 
dampened media freedom, with journalists r eluctant to report on allegations of 
abuses by pro-government forc es. The government implemented a de facto ban  
on visits by journalists to internally displaced camps, and pressured journalists and victims for reporting on 
allegations  of sex in exchange for humanitarian re-
lief.  
Burkina Faso’s international partners including the European Union, France, the 
United Nations, and the United States readily denounced abuses by Islamist armed groups but were largely reluctant  to denounce or push for investigations 
into those by pro-government forces.  
110WORLD REPORT 2022Abuses by Islamist Armed Groups  
Islamist armed groups allied with Al-Q aeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) in the 
Greater Sahara ki lled over 350 civi lians. Their presence and attacks on military 
targets and  civilians expanded  from Burkina Faso’s north and east into the south 
and west. Their attacks largely targeted  communities which had formed local 
civil def ense groups.  
On November 1, armed Islamists killed around 10 civilians from Dambam village  
on their way to a local market near the border with Niger. On August 18, armed Islamists ambushed a 
convoy of traders near Arbinda , northern Burkina Faso, 
killing 59 civilians and numerous pro-government  security forc e members. On 
June 4 and 5, they killed at least 137 civi lians during an attack on Solhan village, 
in northern Burkina Faso.   
On May 3, armed Islamist fighters killed 30 villagers during an attack on Kodyel 
village. On April 26, they ambushed an anti-poaching patrol,  killing two Spanish 
journalists and an Irish conservationist. During a separate attack the same day, armed Islamists 
killed 18 villagers  in the northern village of Yattakou. Between 
February and May, they killed at least 30 civi lians in northern Oud alan Province, 
including traders on their way to a market in February, and 15 during a baptism  in 
May.  
Throughout 2021, armed Islami st groups abducted scores  of civi lians from vil-
lages, public vehicles, and displacement  camps. Victims included religious and 
health workers, village chief s, traders, and displaced people. Many of the ab-
ducted, including a priest , were later killed, while at least 27 villagers abducted 
from public vehicles between the towns of Dablo and Barsalogho in June and July 
were unaccounted for at time of writing.   
Islamist group fighters also burned vi llages, markets, and businesses; abducted 
and raped dozens of women; imposed their version of Sharia (Islamic law) via 
courts that did not adhere to internation al fair trial standards; and prevented 
farmers from accessing their fields. 
111HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAbuses by State Security Forces and Pro-Government Militias  
There were several allegations of extrajudicial executions of suspects by the 
Burkinabé security forces during counterterrorism operations, most targeting ethnic Peuhl. However, the number of unla wful killing s was lower c ompared to 
2019 and 2020. 
In response to the growing number of Islamist armed attacks, the president re-
moved the defense minister after 
a cabinet reshuffle  and by decree created a 
special force  to fight terrorism whereby special force members “may not be pros-
ecuted for acts committed in the exercise of their functions.”   
State-sponsored self-defense gr oups, notably the Volunteers for the Defense of 
the Homeland (VDP), created in 2020, were implicated in numerous grave crimes 
including arbi trary detentions, tor ture, and unlawful kil lings targeting suspected 
armed Islamists and criminals.  
Some allegations involved the VDPs and security forces working together, in-
cluding the alleged killing in mid-September of six men, including a university student, and the enforced disappearance of five others during a joint operation in the western Cascades region.  
Accountability for Abuses  
There was little progre ss with investig ations into past  atrocities by the security 
services–notably the 2018  and 2019  killings of scores of suspects in Burkina 
Faso’s Sahel region; the deaths of over 200 men in Djibo in 2020 ; and the 
deaths of 12 men in gendarme custody in Tanwalbougou. 
The military justice director ate, mandated to inves tigate incidents involving the 
security forces, continued to be underfunded. 
The high-security prison for t errorism-related offenses remained overcrowded – 
with about 876 people detained in a prison made for 448, at time of writing. The vast majority had been detained far beyond the legal limit. The government took steps to addre ss the back log and to ensure due proce ss by releasing scores of 
suspects accused of terroris m-related off enses against whom there was insuffi-
cient evidence and by beginning trials. Very few detainees had access to defense lawyers.  
112WORLD REPORT 2022A court dedicated to terrori sm-related offenses was established  and started to 
hear cases in mid-2021. One trial, in August, led to the conviction  of two mem-
bers of the Islamist armed group Ansar oul Islam for a 2018 attack on a primary 
school; however, the proceeding raised due process concerns , including that de-
fendants were not informed of their legal right to counsel. 
The long-awaited trial of those implicated  in the 1987 assassin ation of P resident 
Thomas Sanka ra and 12 others began on October 11 . The 14 men standing trial 
include former President Blaise Compaoré, who fled to Côte d’Ivoire in 2014 after 
being ousted in a popular uprising. He and several others will be tried in absen-tia. In July, France 
approved an extradition request  from Burkina Faso for 
François Compaoré, brother of the former p resident, for his alleged involvement 
in the 1998 murder of prominent investig ative journalist Norbert Zongo.  
Children’s Rights and Attacks on Education  
Armed groups, notably armed Islamists , increased their recruitment and use of 
children. At least 15 children we re among those detained in the high security 
prison. Over 300,000 children  were out of school due to the closure of 2,244 
schools as a result of insecurity as of May, approximately 10 percent of the coun-try’s schools, according to the United  Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF.) During 
2021, at least 30 education-related attac ks by Islamist armed groups, including 
damaging or pillaging schools and  abducting, detaining, or threatening teach-
ers, were documented by Human Rights Watch or reported by Burkina Faso’s Ed-ucation Ministry or the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (
ACLED ) Project.   
Key International Actors  
The rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation garnered signifi-cant attention from Burkina Faso’s key international partners. They issued sev-eral statements denouncing abuses by Islamist armed groups but were reluctant to denounce abuses by pro-government forces or publicly press the national au-thorities to investigate the allegations. 
Donors, notably France, the Netherlands, the UN, and the US, supported pro-
grams to improve the justice sector, address prison overcrowding and extended 
113HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHpretrial detention of terrorism sus pects, and provide human rights training for 
the security forces.  
G5 Sahel, a regional counterterrorism force created in 2017 that includes Burkina 
Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, conducted operations along Burkina Faso’s northern borders with 
Mali  and Niger , some of which involved French 
troops. 
In October, the UN Office of the High C ommiss ioner for Human Rights  signed an 
agreement to open a country office  mandated to monitor the conduct of security 
force operations during G5 Sahel operations and, more widely, to support the national  human rights commiss ion and civil soc iety.  
The US provided US$2 million in training programs to counter improvised explo-
sive devices (IEDs), as well as $5 mi llion in counterterrori sm funding to develop 
the law enforcement capacity to investigat e complex terrorism cases. As of July, 
the US had committed 
$69 million  to Burk ina Faso’s hum anitarian assist ance, 
health, peace and security, program support, and economic development sec-tors. 
The EU provided 
€188.6 million  in humanitari an assist ance to the Sahel and 
€4.5 billion in support for the G5 Sahel joint counterterrorism force, including for the human rights due diligence framework, whic h presses governments to en-
sure their forces respect human rights during operations.  
France, Burkina Faso’s leading bilateral donor, provides military training to Burk-
inabé troops and supported security operations in the Sahel region through its 5,100-strong Operation Barkhane counterinsurgency operation, which is set to draw down in 2022.  
In response to the gravity and number of attacks on schools and the killing and 
maiming of children, the UN secretary-general included Burkina Faso as a situa-tion of concern for the UN’s monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave viola-tions against children during armed conflict. 
114WORLD REPORT 2022Burundi 
Since President Évariste Ndayishimiye came to power in June 2020, there have 
been limited improvements in Burundi’s human rights situation. His administra-tion released four journalists and tw o human rights defenders, jailed on base-
less charges. The authorities lifted some restrictions on medi a and civi l society, 
while promises were made to rein in the ruling party’s youth league, the Imbon-
erakure.  
However, many of Ndayishimiye’s repeat ed promises to deliver justice and pro-
mote political toler ance remain unfulfilled. The president has appointed ruling 
party hardliners to key positions. Sanctions  against the prime minister and three 
other individuals were lifted by the United States in November. The minister of 
interior, community development, and public security remains under European Union targeted sanctions. Killings, disappear ances, torture, ill-treatment, arbi-
trary arrests and detention, and sexual and gender-based violence were docu-
mented by international and Burundian rights groups. Unidentified dead bodies, 
often mutilated or tied up, were regularly found in different parts of the country, 
often buried by local authorities, Imbonerakure members, or police, without in-vestigation. 
Ndayishimiye has sh own greater openne ss than his predeces sor toward the in-
ternational community. In February 202 1, the Burundian government and repre-
sentatives of the European Union and its member states resumed a political dialogue, on ho ld since 2016 . The Burundi an government has pr oduced 
a technical roadmap regarding human rights and other reforms, but it is vague and noncommittal and avoids addressing imp unity for the many crimes commit-
ted since 2015. 
Security Situation and Political Repression  
Since August 2020, there have been several reports of security incidents involv-ing clashes between security forces and  armed groups, as well as attacks by 
unidentified assailants. Attacks by armed grou ps were reported in Cibitoke and 
other provinces bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo. In some of these attacks, Imbonerakure members supported the national army. Groups of uniden-
115HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtified armed men are also reported to be responsible for random attacks result-
ing in civili an casualties. The Buru ndian authorities denou nced these as “terror-
ist” or “criminal” acts and committed abuses against alleged perpetrators and civili ans.  
According to the 
report of the Comm ission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Bu-
rundi , men suspected of  belonging to, or assis ting, armed groups we re executed 
by police or national intelligence agents throughout 2021. Dozens of real or sus-pected members of opposition groups have  been victims of enforced disappear-
ances. Many people were also detained by the National Intelligence Service and allegedly subjected to severe torture, rape, and ill-treatment. 
Local and international monitoring grou ps, including Human Rights Watch, docu-
mented cases of torture of people sus pected of collaborating with armed groups. 
The Comm ission of Inquiry on Burundi docu mented cases where victims died  in 
detention. 
Despite a lull in abuses against opposition members after the May 2020 elec-
tions, killings, di sappearances, to rture, arbitra ry detention, and harassment of 
those perceived to oppose the gov ernment continued throughout 2021. There 
have been limited attempts by authorities to rein in the Imbonerakure. Some members were prosecuted, although rarely  because of serious criminal offenses, 
in trials that often lacked transpar ency. Fabien Banciryanino, a former member 
of parliament  and outspoken human rights adv ocate was convicted of abusive 
security-related charges on May 7 and sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 
100,000 Buru ndian Francs (US$51). He was released  after time served on Octo-
ber 1. 
On March 5, a presidential decree announced the pardon or early release of 
more than 5,000 prisoners. However, the dec ree excluded many prisoners in pre-
trial detention or accused of security-rel ated offenses, many of whom were ar-
rested in the aftermath of protests over the former President Pierre Nkurunziza’s 2015 bid for a third term and ar e held on political grounds. 
Civil Society and Media 
Many members of civi l society or journ alists who fled in 2015 remain in exile. 
During former Pres ident Nkurunziza’s third and  final term, independent  civil so-
116WORLD REPORT 2022ciety and media were relentlessly attac ked, and their members killed, disap-
peared, jailed, and threatened.  
Although Nda yishmiye’s gov ernment has lifted some restrictions, including the 
suspension of the anti-corruption organization PARCEM (Parole et Action pour le Réveil des Consciences et l’Évolution des Mentalités), the authorities continue to exercise undue interfer ence in and overs ight over the operations of civil soci-
ety and the media.  
Since Ndayishimiye’s election, several unfairly imprisoned journalists and 
human rights defenders were released. Four  journalists working for Iwacu, the 
popular news website, were pardoned and released on December 24, 2020. 
Their pardon does not acquit them of the politically motivated conviction for complicity in an “impossible attempt” to undermine the internal security of the 
state. 
Nestor Nibitanga, a human rights defender arrested in Nove mber 2017 and con-
victed on secu rity charges, was par doned and relea sed on April 27 . The convic-
tion of Germain Rukuki, a member of ACAT -Burundi, arrested in July 2017 and 
sentenced to 32 years in prison in Apri l 2018 for “rebellion,” “threatening state 
security,” “participation in an insurrectional movement,” and “attacks on the 
head of st ate,” was overtu rned on appeal  in June. Ruku ki was relea sed on June 
21, the same day the EU’s head of delegation announced that the process of lift-ing sanctions on Burundi had been initiated. 
Despite these welcome release s, the space for civil society  and the media to op-
erate remains severely restricted. A lawyer and former human rights defender, 
Tony Germain Nk ina, was sentenced to five years in prison in June, li kely due to 
his past human rights work. On Sept ember 29, his conv iction was m aintained on 
appeal. On February 2, Burundi’s Supreme Court published the guilty verdict—dated June 23, 2020—in the case against 34 people accused of participating in a May 2015 coup attempt, including 12 human rights defenders and journalists in exile. After a trial, du ring which the defendants were absent and did not have 
legal repre sentation, the grou p was found guilty of “attacks on the authority of 
the State,” “ assassin ations,” and “destruction.” 
On February 11, the CNC lifted the ban on public comments on Iwacu, which had 
been in place since April 2018, and pledged to restore access to the website in 
117HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHBurundi. On F ebruary 22, the CNC lifted the b an on Bonesha FM, which was re-
quired to sign an agreement similar to one the private radio station Isanganiro and Rema FM, a pro-ruling party station, signed when they resumed broadcasts in February 2016. On April 21, the CNC authorized several new radio and televi-sion channels to begin operating. However, international media are still re-
stricted, and the BBC and the Voice of America remain suspended since 2018. 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights  
Burundi punishes consensual same-sex se xual relations between adults with up 
to two years in prison under Article 567 of the penal code.  
Refugee Rights  
Burundian authorities have repeatedly spok en of the need for refugees to return 
from exile. As of September 30, 269,330 Burundians officially remain refugees in 
neighboring countries with over 170,000 Burundian refugees being repatriated under the tripartite voluntary repatri ation program launched in 2017. Human 
Rights Wa tch has 
documented  how Tanzanian authorities have forced or coerced 
refugees into signing for “voluntary” repatriations. 
In its September 2021 report , the Comm ission of Inquiry on Burundi s aid th at al-
though the climate of hostility toward re turnees had abated under Ndayishimiye, 
some who had been politically active in the past have been accused of collabo-rating with armed groups, arbitrarily ar rested and detained , and tortured in de-
tention. Some refugees who had returned fled Burundi again during 2021 for fear of being targeted. A group of eight Buru ndian refugees who were tortured and 
forcibly returned to Burundi by Tanzanian security officials were acquitted of se-curity-rel ated charges in Aug ust. At time of writing, the prosec ution has ap-
pealed the verdict.  
Covid-19  
Although the government’s  response to the Covid-1 9 pandemic  was initially 
marked by repression and misinformation, since Ndayishimiye came to power, the authorities have taken steps to curb the spread of Covid-19. In July, the gov-
118WORLD REPORT 2022ernment announced that it would begin vaccinating the population, and the vac-
cination program began in October. 
Cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) resumed with the arrival 
of its new representative in April 2021. In 2020, Nkurunziza’s government had re-fused to follow WHO guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus and declared 
the WHO’s country director and three of  its experts persona non grata.  
Key International Actors  
The UN Comm ission of Inquiry on Burundi, est ablished  in September 2016 to 
document grave human rights violations in the country, concluded on September 16, 2021, that grave human rights violations continued to be committed in Bu-rundi and th at “no struc tural ref orm has been undertaken to d urably improve the 
situation.”  
Despite these findings, the EU tabled a resolution at the September session of 
the UN Human Rights Council, adopted by a vote, which ended the mandate of 
the comm ission and inste ad created a spec ial rapporteur m andate. Bu rundian 
authorities announced that they would not cooperate with even this more lim-ited mandate and continue to refuse to  cooperate with other international or re-
gional human rights mechanisms. 
In 2021, the EU and the Burundi government proceeded to hold several rounds of 
a political dialogue aimed at developing a “roadmap” for reforms, as the govern-
ment presses the EU to lift its 2016 suspension of direct budgetary support. Al-though the government  has yet to meet many of the benc hmarks set by the EU in 
2016, including those rel ating to media and civil society , in June, the EU’s head 
of delegation announced that the process to lift the measures had been initi-ated. 
Despite the lack of substantive progress on human rights issues, on April 27 , the 
African Union Peace and Security Council ended its human rights observer mis-sion and called for lifting all international sanctions against Burundi, and in De-cember 2020, the UN Security Council ended its Burundi-specific briefings. 
119HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCambodia 
In anticipation of upcoming commune and national elections in 2022 and 2023, 
Prime Minister Hun Sen made use of a wo rsening Covid-19 pandemic to expand 
authoritarian control  by fur ther restricting civil and po litical rights and  failing to 
protect the social and economic rights of marginalized groups. His government 
adopted a new, overbroad Covid-19 law , allowing f or up to 20 -year -prison sen-
tences for violations of Covid-19 measures.  
To silence dissent, Cambodi a’s politiciz ed courts held a series of  mass trials 
against over 100 political opposition members and dozens of human rights de-
fenders for exer cising their rights to freedom of  expression and pe aceful assem-
bly. At time of writing, Cambodia had more than 60 political prisoners behind 
bars . 
The government’s harsh Covid-19 lockdowns  were imposed without ensuring ac-
cess to adequate food, medical, and other basic needs. The authorities also re-
sorted to beating people on the streets in Phnom Penh with bamboo canes  for 
leaving their homes in defiance of the Covid-19 edicts. The government also failed to take 
sufficient steps  to prevent major Covid-19 outbreaks among the 
prison population in a penal syst em plagued by massive overcrowding.  
The government adopted a sub-decree that tightens control of the internet and 
expands online surveillance  of internet users critical  of the government, while in-
fringing privacy rights. Independent journalists and media outlets, as well as critical social media users, face d continued government intimidation and at-
tacks.  
New Rights-Ab using Laws and Bills 
The government adopted new measures that further clamp down on human 
rights.  
In February, the authorities enacted the Sub-Decree on the Establishment of the 
National Internet Gateway , which, after coming into effect in February 2022, will 
allow the government to monitor all int ernet activities and grant the authorities 
broad powers to block and disconnect internet connections. 
In March, the government followed with the rights-abusing Law on Measures to 
Prevent the Spread of Covid-19 and  other Serious, Dangerou s and Contagious 
120WORLD REPORT 2022Diseases . The law provides that violations of Covid-19 measures can be pun-
ished by up to 20-year prison sentences and other disproportionate penalties. The law contains ov erly broad provis ions without  independent ov ersight or pro-
cedural safeguards. By May, the authorities had criminally charged 
over 100 peo-
ple with violating the law .  
Other draconian laws are still awaiting finalization of drafting or adoption, such 
as a cybercrime bill , which poses further threats  to online speech, and a draft 
public order law  that seeks to control people’s daily lives by prohibiting a vast 
array of public and private actions. Cambodia has no data  protection law  or safe-
guards to ensure official requests for da ta are necessary and proportionate. 
Human Rights Watch obtained in March a copy of a draft disability law  that fails 
to adopt a human rights-based approach to ensure equal rights for people with disabilities. The draft law reinforces stigma against people with disabilities 
rather than ensuring equal access to education, employment, transportation, so-cial and legal services, and independent living. 
Human Rights Defe nders Behind Bars 
At time of writing, the government held at least 24 human rights defenders in 
jail.  
In August, the authorities convicted  trade union leader Rong Chhun of incite-
ment, together with former political oppos ition members Sar Kanika and Ton 
Nimol. Their sentences ranged from 20 months to two years in prison and a large fine of 400 million riel (nearly US$100,000), which must be paid to the govern-ment’s Border Affairs Committee. Rong Chhun’s 
arrest  followed his public com-
ments on communities’ land loss because of the demarcation of the Cambodia-Vietn am border. The two other act ivists had 
peacefully  protested  for 
Chhun’s release. The authorities arrested  nineteen act ivists, artists, and human 
rights defenders for particip ating in similar protests.  
In August, a Phnom Penh court convicted  nine act ivists and f ormer opposition 
members of incitement and sentenced them to between 12 and 20 months in prison. They had peacefully 
protested  near the Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh 
as part of a 2020 campaign to commemorate the Paris Peace Accords anniver-sary.  
121HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAttacks Against Environmental Activists  
Starting in 2020, the authorities stepped up  their attempts to intimidate peace-
ful environment al activis ts, accusing them of attempting to use foreign funds to 
topple the government . In May 2021, a Phnom Penh court convicted  five Mother 
Nature Cam bodia (MNC) act ivists of incitement and sentenced them to between 
18 and 20 months in pri son. The act ivists had publicly rai sed concerns  over the 
filling-in of a lake in Phnom Penh and its  expected negative environmental im-
pacts. In July, the authorities imposed additional charges of conspiracy against 
three of the activis ts. 
In June, the authorities charged  four other MNC  activis ts for doc umenting the 
government’s destruction of the environment and prosecuted them on charges 
including conspiracy and insulting the king. Authorities detained three of them and remanded them to pre-trial detention; the fourth remained outside the country.  
Attacks Against Political Opposition Members  
With upcoming elections in 20 22 and 2023, harassment intensified against 
members of the political opposition. Many  leaders and senior members of the 
dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) were forced to flee the country and remained abroad out of fear of being arrested.  
After issuing court summons in Novem ber 2020, the authorities started mass tri-
als in 2021 against over 100 persons c onnected with CNRP , as well as political 
activis ts. In March, the authorities 
convicted  nine exiled CNRP leaders in absen-
tia based on attempted “attack” charges, including CNRP leader Sam Rainsy, 
and sentenced them to up to 25 years in prison. The case against them is based on false allegations that the CNRP attempted to stage a coup by announcing their plans to return to Cambodia in November 2019. 
The head of the CNRP , Kem Sokha, continues to face trumped-up treason 
charges. His three-month-long tria l was interrupted in March 2020 
due to Covid-
19. In January 2021, the court inf ormed him th at his case was no longer a “prior-
ity” and unlikely to resume in 2021 because the authorities were pursuing new 
cases against hundreds of opposition members.  
122WORLD REPORT 2022Impunity  
July 2021 marked five years since the unlawful kil ling of pr ominent politic al com-
mentator and human rights defender Kem Ley . To date, ther e has been no credi-
ble, independent investigation into his ki lling in broad daylight in downtown 
Phnom Penh. There has also been no progre ss made to uncover the facts around 
the abduction of prominent  Thai act ivist Wanchale arm Satsa ksit. Both cases 
have yet to see justice, despite evidence and witness testimony pointing to likely government involvement that requires an effective and transparent investiga-
tion.  
Freedom of Media  
In 2021, the authorities used the pandemic  to further stifle independent media 
by labelling independent reporting as “fake news”  and imposing de facto bans 
on independent reporting .  
In January, Phnom Penh authorities announced  a directive that seeks to ban 
filming, recording, and livestreaming of police actions. 
In May, the Ministry of Information announced  that only state media or media 
“invited” by the government would be permitted to repor t from ar eas u nder 
harsh Covid-19 lockdowns. Following livestreaming of long queues of Covid-19 patients outside government treatment centers, the ministry 
issued  a letter 
warning journalists not to disseminate information that could “provoke turmoil in society,” and threatened legal action against those that disobeyed.  
In July, Phnom Penh police 
questioned  three journalists who covered a land 
protest and coerced them into s igning an agreement, pledging not to report 
again on the land situation. These intimidator y efforts are common tactics by the 
authorities to silence independent voices. 
The government’s campaign to silence critical  commentary extends also to so-
cial media platforms. In August, the government sent senior officials to Bangkok to 
ask Thai authorities to block or otherwise stop the critical social media broad-
casts of oppos ition act ivists res iding in Thai land. 
123HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHLack of Adequate Standard of Living 
As a result of a rapid spike in Covid-19 cases, authorities in April introduced a 
color-based zoning system under which loc kdown measures were imposed in 
areas with higher case counts. Re sidents in so-c alled “red z ones,” disp ropor-
tionately low-income populations, faced the most restrictive lockdown meas-ures, including a ban on leaving their homes. For over a month, many residents were unable to work and had inadequate access to food, medicine, and other basic necessities. The authorities denied acce ss to aid groups and United Na-
tions agencies to distribute aid to those urgently needing it. Protesting residents were accused of being affiliated with the 
opposition .  
The pandemic revealed the absence of a robust social protection system , leaving 
low-income households dispr oportionately harmed by Covid-19’s economic im-
pact and lockdowns without a safety net. Sporadic one-off cash transfers and an 
unaddressed micro-loan debt cr isis failed to  guarantee Cam bodians’ rights to 
social security and an adequate living standard. 
Key International Actors  
Cambodia continued to strengthen its  ties with China during the pandemic. 
While the European Union had partially suspended  Cambodia’s trade prefer-
ences in August 2020 after finding systematic rights violations, bilateral trade between Cambodia and China increased by 20 percent to 
US$3 billion  during the 
first quarter of 2021. Cambodia is a key “Belt and Road Initiative” partner; how-ever, rights abuses continue to mar large-scale development projects in Cambo-dia.  
Cambodia ra nks among countries with the 
highest percentages  of people fully 
vaccinated . In September, China pledged  US$270 million in aid and 3 million 
Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine doses— adding  to 3.2 million Sinovac and Sinopharm 
vaccine doses already provided. In mid-2021, through COVAX, Japan , the United 
States  and the United Kingdom  donated other Covid-19 vaccines.  
In March, the European Parliament adopted a strongly worded resolution  con-
demning the mass trials against oppos ition members as well as the intensifying 
clampdown on independent  media and civil society , while calling for sanctions 
124WORLD REPORT 2022against rights-abusing Cambodian leadership. An EU statement  also condemned 
the mass tria ls. 
The United State s, in part because of the ongoing harassment of envi ronmental 
activis ts, announced  on June 17 that it halted over $100 million in funding to the 
government regarding the forestry-pr otection “Greening Prey Lang” project.  
In October, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a weakly worded resolution  
extending the mandate of the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, mandating a one-time oral update in March 2022 in addition to ordinary reporting by the special rapporteur.  
125HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCameroon 
Armed groups and government forces committed human rights abuses, includ-
ing mass kil lings, across C ameroon’s Anglophone r egions and in the Far North 
region. 
As the cr isis in the Anglophone regions c ontinued unabated for the fifth year, 
over 712,000 people were internally displaced in the Anglophone regions and in the Francophone Littoral, West, and Centre regions as of August 2021, and at least 2.2 million people were in need of humanitarian aid. 
Separatists, who have vio lently enforced a boycott on education since 2017 , con-

The Islamist armed group Boko Haram 
increased  its attacks in the Far North re-
gion from January to April, ki lling at l east 80 civili ans, with over 340,000 inter-
nally displaced as of August 2021. In responding to the armed conflict, government forces have also been responsible for violations of international hu-manitarian and  human rights law,  including unlawful 
killings and arbitrary ar-
rests . 
The government continued to restrict freedom of expression and association, 
while state-sanctioned persecution of lesbi an, gay, bisexual and transgender 
(LGBT) people intensified . Government forces subjected Cameroonian asylum 
seekers deported from the United States to serious human rights violations fol-lowing their return, including physical assault and abuse, arbitrary arrest and de-
tention, extortion, and confiscation of identity documents, thus impeding freedom of movement, ability to work, and access to public services. The govern-
ment’s response to the Co vid-19 pandemic  lacked transpar ency and  was marred 
by allegations of corruption and misappropriation of funds. 
126WORLD REPORT 2022Anglophone Crisis  
Based on Human Rights Watch’s field and open source  research , at least 4,000 
civilians have been killed by both gov ernment forces and armed separ atist fight-
ers since late 2016 in the North-West and South-West regions, as separatists seek independence for the country’s minority Anglophone regions.  
Abuses by Government Forces  
Security forces responded to separatist attacks with a heavy hand, often target-
ing civi lians across the Anglophone regions.  
On January 10, army soldiers killed  at least nine civili ans, including a wo man and 
a child, in Mautu village, South-West r egion. The soldiers also looted scores of 
homes and threatened residents. 
In Gom village, North-West region, on June 8 , two soldiers broke into the house 
of fon (the local tradition al authority) and harassed eight  people there, including 
a 72-year-ol d man whom they beat. They also s hot and ki lled Nw ang Lydia, a 60-
year-old woman, after she failed to provide information about a separatist fighter. 
On 
June 9 , soldiers from the regul ar army and the elite Rapid Intervention Battal-
ion ( Bataillon d’Intervention Rapide , BIR) killed a 58-year-ol d man and raped a 
53-year-ol d woman during a security oper ation in and arou nd Mbuluf village, 
North-West region. They also broke into, damaged, and looted at least 33 shops and homes, including the residence of the fon in Ndzeen village.  
On October 14, a gendarme shot and 
killed  Caroluise Enondiale, a 4-year-ol d girl, 
on her way to school in Buea, South-West region. An angry mob responded by lynching the gendarme.  
On November 10, an improvised expl osive device was thrown on to the roof of a 
lecture hall at the University of Buea, South-West region, 
wounding  at least 11 
students. At time of writing no one had claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities 
blamed  separatist fighters.

On January 9, suspected separatist fighters killed the principal of a high school 
in Eyumojock, South-West region, and wounded a principal from another high school in Tinto, South-West region. On Januar y 12, separatist fighters shot and 
injured a female public-school teacher in Bamenda, North-West region.  
Separatist fighters 
killed  three tribal chiefs in Essoh Attah village, South-West re-
gion, on February 13. On February 27 , armed separatists kidnapped  a medical 
doctor in Bali, North-West  region and threat ened to kill him before r eleas ing him 
the same day after a ransom payment. 
On June 6, separatist fighters attacke d a religious center in Mamfe, South-West 
region, killing a 12 -year-old boy and wo unding a 16 -year-old boy. Separatist 
fighters killed Fuh Max Dang, a ph ysics teacher at Government Bilingual High 
School in Kumba, South-West region, on July  1. On August 29, armed separatists 
kidnapped Julius Agbortoko, a Catholic priest of the Mamfe diocese in the South-
West region and asked for 20 million CF A (around US $34,000) ransom for his re-
lease. 
Restrictions on Humanitarian Access and Abuses against  
Aid Workers  
Humanitarian access is severely restricted and humanitarian workers have been 
victims of attacks by both government forces and groups separatist armed 
groups . In December 2020, the Cameroonian authorities suspended  all activities 
of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctor s Without Borders) in the North-West 
region, accusing the organization of being too close to Anglophone separatists. 
The move forc ed MSF to withdraw from the region , leaving tens of thousands of 
people without access to vital health care . 
Separatist fighters have  also hindered aid agencies’ access  in the ar eas u nder 
their control. On February 4, a nurse working with an international nongovern-mental org anization (NGO) was shot and injured as her ambulanc e was c aught in 
129HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthe crossfire during a separatist attack  on Mbalangi village, South-West region. 
On June 25, fighters from the separatist armed group Ambazonia Defense Forces 
(ADF) stopped a humanitarian vehicle in Guzang, North-West region, kidnapped the four staff members, beat one, and released them the following day.  
Attacks in the Far North by Boko Haram 
In the first half of 2021, attacks and raids by the Islamist armed group Boko 
Haram increa sed in the Far Nor th Region, with at  least 80 civi lians kil led. On Jan-
uary 8, a Boko Haram suic ide attack kil led at least 14 civi lians, including 8 chil-
dren, and wounded 3 others, including 2 children. The presumed death  in May of 
Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, in a confrontation in Nigeria with 
the splinter faction Islamic State W est Africa Province (ISWAP), helped consoli-
date ISWAP’s power  and increased insecurity  in Cameroon’s Far North region. 
Crackdown on Political Opposition, Dissent 
The government limited the ability of the political opposition to function freely. 
Authorities prohibited a demonstration  by the country’s main opposition party, 
Cameroon Renaissance Movement ( Mouvement pour la renaissance du Camer-
oun, MRC), planned for July 25 in Yaoundé, the capital, citing concerns around 
Covid-19 and general public order. On the same day, a demonstration by sup-porters of the ruling party took place in Bertoua, Eastern region.  
On August 9, gendarmes arbitrarily arrested prominent tech entrepreneur, 
human rights campaigner, and vocal critic of President Paul Biya, Rebecca Enon-chong, in Douala. She was held  in custody for “c ontempt of a magistrate” until 
August 13, when she was released and all ch arges against her dropped.  
At least 124 opposition party members and supporters arrested in September 
2020 during peaceful demonstrations remained in detention on politically moti-vated charges, including Olivier Bibou Nissack and Alain Fogué Tedom, two 
prominent MRC members. 
130WORLD REPORT 2022Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
Cameroon’s  penal code  punishes “sexual relations between persons of the 
same sex” with up to five years in prison. Security forces  arbitrarily arrested, 
beat, or threatened  at least 24 peop le, including a 17 -year-old boy,  for alleged 
consensual same-sex conduct or gender nonc onformity. Some were subjected to 
forced anal examinations. On May 11, a Cameroonian court sentenced Shakiro and Patricia, two 
transgender women , to five years in prison and fines of 
200,000 CFA (US$370) for alleged same-sex relations.  
Justice and Accountability 
Since January, seven hearings were held in the trial of three security force mem-bers accused of involvement in the 
killings of 21 civi lians  in Ngarbuh village, 
North-West region. The trial is being held before a military court in Yaoundé, about 380 kilometers from Ngarbuh, making it 
difficult for family members of vic-
tims to attend . The defendants are charged  with murder, arson, destruction, vio-
lence against a pregnant woman, and disobeying orders. Sev enteen members of 
a vigilante group and a former separatist fighter have also been charged but re-
main at large.  
In June 2020, the French ambassador to Cameroon told the media that President 
Biya had assured him that an investigation would be opened into the death in custody of jo urnalist 
Samuel Wazizi  in August 2019. Howe ver, there has not  been 
any progress on the investigation.  
On July 26, the Special Criminal Court, which oversees cases relating to the mis-
appropriation of public funds, adjourned for the 74th time the trial of journalist Amadou Vamoulke ́ , arrested in 2016 for 
alleged embezzlement . In 2020, the 
United Nations Working Group on Arbitra ry Detention found his detention to be 
arbitrary .  
On September 7 , a military court in Buea, South-West region, sentenced  4 people 
to death by firing squad for the killing of 7 children and the injuring of at least 13 others last year at a school in Kumba, South-West region. Defense lawyers said 
the trial was marred by serious proced ural irregul arities, starting w ith the use of 
military courts to tr y civili ans, and including that the entir e prosecution case was 
based on statements from alleged witnesses, none of whom were brought to 
131HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcourt to be examined on their statements. In addition to those obstacles pre-
venting the accused fr om being able to p resent a defense, ther e was no transla-
tion from English or French into Cameroonian Pidgin English, the language 
spoken by the majority of the defendants.  
In an October 14 press rel ease, the army spokesperson acknowledged  the “dis-
proportionate re action” of a gendarme who shot  and killed  a 4-yea r-old girl on 
her way to school in Buea, South-West region, and said an investigation has 
been opened.  
Women’s Rights 
Discrimination against women is prevalent within Cameroonian society and in-
corporated in l aws that su bordinate w omen’s stat us to men. The civil c ode, 
which applies in Francophone r egions, provides that men are the head of house-
holds (Article 213), husbands have the right  to choose the place of residence (Ar-
ticle 215), men and women do not have equal rights to immovable property (Article 1428), and spouses do not have  equal administrative authority over as-
sets during marriage (Articles 1421 and  1428). Domestic violence is endemic. 
There is no legislation that specifically criminalizes domestic violence or pro-
vides for preventative measures nor measures to promote protection of sur-
vivors. 
Corruption  
The government did not publish meaningful information about its Covid-19 spending, and many health care workers reported receiving little or no support to aid their pandemic response. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved two emergency loans  and a mult iyear program to  Cameroon tot aling over US$1 
billion, despite the government failing to meet several of the transparency com-mitments in those loans.  
On May 19, Cameroonian media 
published  a summary of an audit by a Supreme 
Court investigative body, the  Chambres des Comptes , which detailed findings of 
large-scale corruption and mismanagement involving 180 billion CFA ($333 mil-lion) dedicated to the Covid-19 response. It recommended “initiating 10 judicial cases regarding findings that likely violate criminal law.” Cameroonian authori-
132WORLD REPORT 2022ties have not yet commissioned or published  an independent audit of Covid-19 
spending, despite promising the IMF to do so by December 31, 2020.  
Key International Actors 
In January, the Vatican’s secre tary of state  visited C ameroon and exp ressed the 
Roman Catholic Church’s willingness to facilitate dialogue  between the govern-
ment and separatists. 
On June 7 , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced  visa restrictions “on 
individuals who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the peaceful resolution of the cr isis in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon” 
and condemned “human rights violations and abuses, and threats against advo-cates for peace or humanitarian workers.” 
Although Cameroon is not formally on the agenda of the UN Security Council, 
council members discuss the country during periodic sessions on the work of the UN Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA). Human Rights Watch and other or-ganizations have cal led on the council to formal ly add the cr isis in C ameroon’s 
Anglophone regions to its agenda. 
In November, the European Parliament  adopted a resolution deploring human 
rights abuses in Cameroon and urging the European Union to step up action to address them. The EU repeatedly raised concerns about Cameroon at the UN Human Rights Council. 
133HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCanada 
Since assuming office in 2015, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
has m ade notable eff orts to advance h uman rights in Canada. Despite progress, 
serious domestic and foreign policy ch allenges remain. These include wide-rang-
ing abuses against Indigenous people s and immigration detainees, including 
persons with disabilities. Canada’s failu res to mitigate the impact of climate 
change and provide adequate government support are also leading to violations in Indigenous communities across the countr y while compounding risks for peo-
ple with disabilities and older people. Canada also gr apples with serious human 
rights issues abroad relating to the lack of accountability for abuses by Canadian mining companies and meaningful action to repatriate Canadian nationals un-lawfully detained in northeast Syria f or suspected Islamic State (ISIS) ties. 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples  
Wide-ranging abuses against Indigenous people s persist across Canada with 
significant ch allenges remaining to u ndo decades of structural and systemic  dis-
crimination.  
Inadequate access to clean, safe drinking water continues to pose a major pub-
lic health conc ern in many Indigenous communitie s—and continues to impede 
efforts to advance Indigenous rights in Canada, one of the world’s most water-rich countries.  
The government c ommitted to end all dri nking water advisorie s on First Nations 
reserves by 2021 but, as of Septem ber, more than 30 First Nations communities 
across Canada remained subject to long-term water advi sories, which alert com-
munities when their water is not safe to drink. In July, an CDN$8 million settle-ment agreement was reached in two c lass action lawsuits against the federal 
government brought by First Nations communities living under drinking water advisories.  
In September, the Canadian Human Rights Tr ibunal rejected the federal govern-
ment’s request f or judicial review of two decis ions relating to Indigenous chil-
dren. In 2019, the tribunal found that Ottawa “willfully and recklessly discriminated against Indigenous children on reserve by failing to provide fund-
134WORLD REPORT 2022ing for child and family services.” The tribunal ordered the government to pro-
vide up to CDN$40 ,000 to each Indigenous child who was u nnecessarily taken 
into government care on or after January 1, 2006.  
From May to July, hundreds of unmarked  graves were found at former govern-
ment-funded  and churc h-run residential  schools in the provinc es of British Co-
lumbia and Saskatchewan. Approx imately 150,000 Indigenous children were 
removed from their families and communities and placed in residential schools, 
where they were forbidden to spea k their own languages or practice their cul-
ture. Many also suffered physical and se xual abuse at residential schools, which 
operated until the 1990s. 
Prime Minister Trude au called on the Roman Catholic Ch urch, which ran residen-
tial schools across Canada, to make a formal apology and publish their records. 
Indigenous groups and the former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commis-sion cal led for an independent inves tigation and resou rces from the federal gov-
ernment to continue forensic investigations of burial sites at former residential 
schools.  
In June, the Canadi an government p assed Bill C-15, estab lishing a fr amework for 
implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peo-ples (UNDRIP) into federal legislation. The legislation requires that all levels of government affirm Indigenous rights as protect ed by international human rights 
standards.   
Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls  
New data released by Statistics Canada in May found that more than six out of 10 Indigenous women reported experiencing physica l or sexual assault at some 
point in their lifetime. The report further found that 83 percent of Indigenous women who identify as lesbian, bisexual, or transgender had experienced inti-mate partner abuse. 
In June, the federal government released a report promising a series of “transfor-
mative changes” to address persistent  discrimination and violence against In-
digenous women and gender-diverse peop le. In June, Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau promised $2.2 billion in new spending over five years to address the root causes of vio lence against Indigenou s women and girls. Ca nada has yet to 
135HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHrelease a federal action plan to add ress violence agains t Indigenous women and 
girls. 
Immigration Detention  
Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government released immi-
gration detainees at unprecedented rates due to public health concerns. How-ever, a joint Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International report released in June found that Canada continues to detain people on immigration grounds in often abu sive c onditions. People in immigration detention, inc luding persons 
with disabilities as well as those fleeing persecution and seeking protection in 
Canada, are regularly h andcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact 
with the outside world. With no set release date, they can be held for months or years. Many are held in provincial jails with the regular jail population and are also sometimes subjected to solitary confinement.   
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) remains the only major law enforce-
ment agency in Canada without independent  civili an oversight . CBSA’s 
unchecked exercise of its  broad mandate and enforcement  powers has repeat-
edly resulted in serious human rights vi olations in the context of immigration de-
tention.  
Corporate Accountability  
Canada is home to half of the world’s mining companies, with operations in 
nearly 100 coun tries around  the world. Despite its ex tensive  reach, the govern-
ment has consist ently failed to implement promi sed reforms to hold Canadian 
mining companies accountable for abuses  committed abroad. The Canadian 
Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (C ORE) established in 2018 still lacks 
the authority to independently investigate or publicly report on human rights 
abuses involving Ca nadian extractive  companies and  has limited capa city to 
hold responsible parties accountable. 
In June, the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights 
tabled a report calling on the government to introduce legislation requiring Canadian companies to conduct hum an rights due diligence to “identify, pre-
vent, mitigate and account for any potential adverse h uman rights, environmen-

In February, a Canadian member of p arliament filed a petition in the House of 
Commons calling on the government to inv estigate the role of Canadian mining 
companies in the extrajudicial killings of  environmental and human rights de-
fenders in the Philippines. 
In March, a Canadian law professor filed a lawsuit against the federal govern-
ment alleging that it improperly withheld information about its diplomatic inter-ventions on behalf of a Canadian mining company accused of human rights violations at its mine in Guatemala.  
In May, over 80 civil society  organizations released a letter calling on Canadian 
mining company Barrick Gold, as well as the government of the Dominican Re-
public, to reconsider the planned expansion of the Pueblo Viejo gold mine due to concerns about environmental and human rights impacts.  
Counterterrorism  
Nearly four do zen Canadian men, women, and children rem ain unla wfully and in-
definitely detained in northeast Syria in locke d desert camps and prisons for Is-
lamic State (ISIS) suspects and their f amilies. The government of Prime Minister 
Trudeau continues to fail to  take adequate steps  to assis t and repatriate these 
nationals, who have spent over two yea rs in filthy, deep ly degrading, life-threat-
ening and often in human conditions. None of the Ca nadians has been charged 
with any crime or brought before a judge to review the legality and necessity of 
their detention.  
In March, Canada w ith the assistanc e of a former US diplom at repatriated a 4-
year-old Canadian child from one of these camps, but refused to bring her Cana-dian mother home. The mother was able to  leave northeast Sy ria, but at time of 
writing remained stuck in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq awaiting travel documents that Canada needed to provide her in order for her to come home. At time of writ-ing, Covid-19 was rapidl y spreading ac ross northeast Syria with nearly  30,000 
cases reported in the region in Septem ber  alone. The World Health Organization 
has w arned of “s ignificant ris k” of high tr ansmiss ion in the camps.  
138WORLD REPORT 2022In June, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Develop-
ment released a report following a p arliamentary hearing on the impact of Covid-
19 on children in crisis settings and ca lled on the go vernment to “p ursue all 
options possible” to repatriate Canadi an children detained in northeast Syria. 
The committee urged the government to “make every effort” to provide consular assistanc e to all detained Can adians. Opposition M Ps on the committee tabled a 
supplementary report, recommending that  the government act immediately to 
facilitate the swift repatriation of Canadian children and provide consular serv-ices to the detainees.  
In September, 26 detainees in northeast Syri a and their families in Canada filed 
an application in federal court against the gov ernment for failing to repatriate or 
help secure the release of these citizens. In September, Kimberly Polman, one of the Canadian detainees, began a hunger strike to protest her lack of medical care.   
Climate Change Policy and Impacts  
As a top 10 global green house gas emitter Canada  is contr ibuting to the climate 
crisis taking a growing toll on human rights around the globe . Since being 
elected in 2015, the Trude au government has r epeatedly  pledged to p ursue am-
bitious action to reduce greenhou se gas emiss ions. 
However, Canada r emains the on ly G7 country whose gr eenhouse gas  emissions 
have increased substantially since the adoption of the Paris Agreement.  
Canada is also the top per capita public financer of fossil fuels in the world and 
projects increased oil production thr ough 2050. According to the Climate Action 
Tracker, Canada’s  commitment to r educe em issions by 40-45 percent below 
2005 levels by 2030 is not sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit 
global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. And Canada is not on track to meet its target.  
World governments’ failure to tackle climate change is already taking a growing 
toll on marginalized populations in Canada. Warming temperatures and increas-ingly unpredictable weather are reducing the availability of First Nations’ tradi-
tional food  sources, and increasing the difficulty and  danger associa ted with 
harvesting food from the land.  
139HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFederal and provincial climate change policies have failed to put in place ade-
quate measures to support First Nations in adapting to current and anticipated impacts of climate change and have largely ignored the imp acts of climate 
change on First Nations’ right to food. While the federal government made his-toric funding commitments in 2021 to support Indigenous food security and In-digenous-led climate monitoring, much more is needed to address the impact of 
the climate cr isis on First Nations and  to ensure th at appropriate f ood subsidies 
and health resources are available to all who need them. 
Inadequate government support also compounded  risks for people with disabili-
ties and older people during the June 2021 “heat dome,” an extreme and fore-seeable heatwave that killed hundreds of people in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Lack of proper heat planning and lack of access to cooling and targeted support for at-risk populations contributed to unnecessary suffering and possibly deaths.  
Key International Actors  
UN Secretary-General  António Guterres has repeatedly called for co untries to 
repatriate their nationals held as ISIS suspects and family members from north-
east Syria and in March called it “ab solutely essential” that Canada do so. In 
February, the UN special rapporteur for the protection and promotion of human 
rights while countering terrorism had placed Canada on a 57-country “list of shame” for its failure to repatriate Canadian nationals from northeast Syria. The US has also repeated ly called on all coun tries to repa triate their nation als.  Syria. 
The US has also r epeatedly cal led on all countries to repatriate their nationals.  
Foreign Policy  
Prime Minister Trude au has acknowledged the need  for negotiations at the World 
Trade Organization to “resolve” intellectual  property issues constraining supply 
of Covid-1 9 health products globally, but Cana da has not supported the proposal 
of India and South Africa for a waiver of certain pro visions of  the TRIPS agree-
ment, only going as far as supporting text-based negotiations for a consensus-based outcome. 
140WORLD REPORT 2022In January, Canada issued a business advisory to Canadian companies outlining 
the legal and reputational risks of working in Xinjiang, China, where their supply 
chains may be tainted by forced labor. At the June session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Canada delivered a joint statement on behalf of 44 coun-tries, expressing concerns at abuses in Xinjiang, as well as the deteriorating rights situations in Hong Kong and Tibet. 
At the February session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Canada as 
a member of a core group on Sri Lanka supported the adoption of a resolution establishing a new accountability mechanism to collect, analyze, and preserve evidence of international crimes for use in future prosecutions. 
In March, Canada joined more than 30 countries in supporting a joint declaration 
condemning human rights abuses  in Egypt, including the crackdo wn on civil so-
ciety and political opposition, and called  for “accountability and immediate end 
of impunity.” 
In April, Canada announced additional sanctions on individuals and entities af-
filiated with the Myanmar military and issued an advisory for Canadian compa-nies doing business with Myanmar-related entities. In July and August, Canada 
also imposed targeted sanctions on ind ividuals in Nicaragua and Belarus re-
spectively in response to ongoing human rights violations. 
141HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCentral African Republic 
Violence involving attacks on civi lians continued across the country as govern-
ment forces, with support from the Rwand an military and Russian mercenaries, 
fought the remnants of a rebel coalition  that controls significant parts of the 
country. The Coalition of Patriots for Change ( Coalition des patriotes pour le 
changement , CPC) attacked major towns in la te 2020, preventing hundreds of 
thousands of people from voting in the December 27 presidential election won 
by President Faustin Archange Touadéra. Legislative elections, held in March, were more successful with only some parts of the country experiencing violence due to the counteroffen sive against the CPC.  
A January 13 CPC offen sive on the capital, B angui, was thwarted , and the c ity re-
mained relatively stable. Much of the countryside, especially the northwest and the east, rem ained contested territor y, with civi lians often c aught between the 
rebels and the government forces with their foreign allies.  
Groups allied to the CPC, notably the Union for Peace in the Central African Re-
public (UPC) in the east and 3R in the northwest, committed widespread abuses, including deliberat ely tar geting civili ans. 
Credible reports , including from the 
United Nations, indicated that security fo rces and Russian mercenaries also 
committed serious human rights abuses. On July 21, unidentified assailants car-
ried out an attack  in Ouham province, outside of Bossangoa, killing at least 13 
people. The government committed  to investigate the crime via a special com-
mission of inquiry.  
More than 2,000 Russian mercenaries, possibly  from Wagner—a mercenary out-
fit affiliated with Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch said to be close to Russ-
ian President Vladimir Putin—are deployed in the Central African Republic. While 
officially in the country to serve  as military ins tructors, the UN has documented  
several instances in which these mercen aries participated in active fighting and 
were implicated in human rights abuses and violations of international humani-tarian law.  
In April, Sidiki Abass, the leader of 3R, who was s anctioned by the UN and the 
United St ates, was 
killed  in combat.  
142WORLD REPORT 2022Several investigations remained pending at the Special Criminal Court  (SCC), a 
war crimes court based in Bangui staffed by national and international judges and prosecutors. In September, the SCC 
announced  charges against a high-rank-
ing member of the presidential guard under former President François Bozizé. The International Criminal Court (ICC) started a 
trial of two anti-balaka suspects 
and held a confirmation of charges hearing in the case of a Seleka leader.  
The country remained one of the most dangerous  places in the world for humani-
tarians to work, with over 261 attacks on humanitarians registered between Jan-
uary and October. 
Attacks on Civilians by Rebel Fighters  
From December 15 to June 2 1, CPC fighters killed at least 61 civi lians, according  
to the UN. Many of them appear to have been targeted because they participated 
in or were suspected of voting in the presidential election. In one case , in March, 
UPC fighters affiliated w ith the CPC in Ouaka province tied up, tortured, and 
killed three men before leaving their bodies on a road with electoral cards hang-
ing around their necks, according to the UN.  
Human Rights Watch also received credible reports throughout 2021 of dozens of 
civilians who were killed by fighters from the UPC in the Ouaka province and 3R 
in the Ouham Pende province. Landmines pl aced by 3R fighters, in an apparent 
attempt to ward off attacks by national forces and their foreign allies in Ouham Pende province, kil led at least 20 civi lians, including a 
worker from a Catholic 
mission  and a humanitarian  worker.  
Abuses by National Forces and Foreign Allies  
Members of the national army, the Forces armées centrafricaines  (FACA), al-
legedly committed serious human rights violations including the extrajudicial ex-ecutions of eight suspected CPC members in Ombella M’Poko province between 
late December and mid-January 2021. In the course of military operations, they also attacke d civi lians, 
occupied schools , and looted private property, according  
to the UN.  
143HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHHuman Rights Watch heard accounts from victims, witnesses, and other credible 
sources about human rights abuses committed by alleged Wagner mercenary fighters in the northwest and the east. In one instance, alleged Wagner fighters 
collaborated with troops from FACA to keep men suspected of being CPC combat-ants in inhum an detention conditions in Basse-K otto province. Three former de-
tainees from Basse-K otto told Human Rights Wa tch that Wagner fighters 
committed extrajudicial executions of other detainees.  
A Central African Republic government report 
published  in October accused 
Russian trainers of committing human rights abuses.  
Shrinking Political Space  
Opposition leaders, including the former Interim President Catherine Samba-
Panza, were forbidden from leaving the country at the beginning of the year due to “ongoing judicial in vestigations” int o alleged li nks to armed groups affiliated 
with the CPC. A January judicial proceeding against Bozizé and other members of Bozizé’s party also loosely 
implicated  other opposition leaders without clear jus-
tification. 
Some programs on Radio Centrafrique and all radio programs that allow listeners 
to call in—on both state and private radio stations—were suspended  by the High 
Communication Council during the presidential electoral period. Officially due to security concerns, the authorities restricted the movement of journalists outside Bangui throughout the year, limiting their ability to  accurately report on abuses 
by rebels, national forces, and internation al forces aligned with the government.  
Justice for Serious Crimes  
In January, Seleka commander Mahamat Said Abdel Kani was transferr ed to ICC 
headquarters in The Hague. Said is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Bangui in 2013. He is the first Seleka leader to face charges before the ICC. The ICC held a hearing on whether to confirm the charges 
in October, which will determine whether there is sufficient evidence for the case 
to go to trial. 
144WORLD REPORT 2022In February, the ICC opened  the trial in the case of anti-balaka leaders Patrice-
Edouard Ngaïssona and Alfred Yéka tom. The charges against both include war 
crimes and crimes against humanity committed between December 2013 and De-
cember 2014. Ngaïssona  was arrested in France and transferred to  the ICC in De-
cember 2018. Yékatom  was tr ansferred to the ICC by Central African Republic 
authorities in November 2018. 
On September 10, the SCC announced  that it had charged Eugène Ngaïkosset 
with crimes against humanity, but did not  specify details of the charges. 
Ngaïkosset, a former captain in the presidential guar d, led a unit th at was impli-
cated in numerous crimes, inc luding the killing of  at least dozens  of civili ans and 
the burning of thousands of homes in the co untry’s northwest and northeast be-
tween 2005 and 2007. He is also alleged to have committed crimes as a leader of the anti-balaka movement. 
Despite some advances in terms of rendering justice, Human Rights Watch re-
ceived credible accounts from victims of crimes committed by FACA or alleged Wagner members who said they were too scared to make judicial complaints. 
In 
response  to a joint report from the UN peacekeeping m ission, MINUSCA, and 
the Office of the UN’s High Commiss ioner for Hum an Rights (OHCHR) in July, the 
government of the Central African Repub lic, which disputed some of the report’s 
findings on abuses by FACA forces, reiter ated that it was re ady to initi ate judicial 
proceedings against perpetrators of serious crimes in order to put an end to 
human rights violations.  
Refugees and Internally Displaced People (IDPs)  
The total number of displaced people rose as a result of renewed fighting. Over 1.4 million people, 
according  to the UN, were either refugees in neighboring 
countries ( 710,000 ) or internally displaced ( 712,000 ) as of September 2021. Over 
233,000 people, 70,000 of whom are children , were newly internally displaced, 
including 131,000 who became refugees due to electoral violence. Conditions for 
IDPs and ref ugees, most of whom stay in camps, remained harsh. Assistanc e to 
IDPs was seriously hampered by att acks on humanit arians and general insecu-
rity in the country.  
145HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAbout 2.8 million people, out of a population of 4.6 million, needed humanitar-
ian assist ance. The humanitari an response plan was underfunded , with a budget 
gap of around US$176 million as of October 2021. 
Key International Actors  
The UN peacek eeping m ission, MINUSCA , deployed 11,938 military peacekeep-
ers and 2,182 police across many parts of the country. Under Chapter VII of the 
UN Charter, the m ission is authorized to take a ll necessary means to protect the 
civili an population from threat of  physical vio lence and to “imp lement a mission-
wide protection strategy.” In November, the UN Security Council extended the 
mandate of  the m ission f or an additional  year. 
On September 15, the m ission announced  the repatriation of the 450-strong con-
tingent from Gabon after internal  investigations revealed cases of sexual ex-
ploitation and abuse of five girls. The UN Secretariat called on the Gabonese 
authorities to appoint a national investigat or to conduct an investigation within 
90 days, and launched its own inves tigation through the Office of Internal Over-
sight Services. Allegations  of sexual violence and  abuse against the Gabonese 
contingent had been made over the past several years.  
In March, a group of UN experts, inc luding those from the Working Group on the 
use of mercenaries, expressed concern  about reports of crimes and human 
rights abuses attributable to fighters from Wagner, working jointly with state se-curity forces (and in some instances, UN peacekeepers), including extrajudicial executions, torture, arbitrary detention, enfor ced disappearances, and forced 
displacement. In October, the same group of UN experts expressed concern about intimidation and violent 
harass ment  by “Russian instructors” from Wagner 
of civili ans, including peacekeepers, journalists, aid worker s, and minorities. 
146WORLD REPORT 2022Chad 
On April 19, the Chadian elector al commiss ion announced  that P resident Idriss 
Déby Itno had won a sixth term in the April 11 presidential elections. The pre-
election period was marred by a  ruthless government crackdown  on protesters 
and the political opposition. On April 20 , a spokesperson for the Chadian 
army  announced  that President Déby, 68, had died of injuries suffered in clashes 
between government forces and rebels fr om the Front for Change and Concord 
in Chad (FACT), based in southern Libya. The exact circumstances of Déby’s death remain unclear. The government and parliament were dissolved, and a Transitional  Military Council (TMC) headed by Mahamat Idriss Dé by Itno, Déby’s 
son, 
took control  of the country and promised an 18-month transition.  
The period follow ing elections and Déb y’s de ath was characterized by violence . 
During protests in late April and May, sec urity forces  used exce ssive fo rce 
against opposition-led demonstrations, and arrested more than 700 people, 
many who reported ill-treatment, including torture, in detention. On October 2, security forces 
fired  teargas caniste rs, rubber bul lets, and potential ly live ammu-
nition at protesters in N’Dj amena, injuring about 40 to 45 people and damaging 
private property. 
On June 10, the authorities released  Baradine Berdei Targuio, a prominent 
human rights defender, arrested  in January after he posted a Facebook message 
about President Déby’s alleged poor health. 
On August 10, the transitional president invited  rebel groups, with whom he had 
previously refused to negotiate, to pa rticipate alongside other stakeholders in a 
national dialogue which started on Novem ber 5. In a November 2 joint state-
ment, Chad’s main rebel groups, including the Union of Resistance Forces (UFR) and the FACT said they are willing to participate in the national dialogue under “certain conditions,” such as the release of members of their groups from prison, and a gener al amnesty. Oppo sition and civil society groups 
criticized  the 
proposed national dialogue but called on transitional authorities to ensure it is 
inclusive.   
Former Chadian dictator Hissène Habré died  of Covid-19 on August 24 in 
Dakar, Senegal’s capital,  where he was serv ing a life sentence for serious inter-
147HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHnational c rimes. In September, a delegation from the Afric an Union visited N’Dja-
mena, Chad’s capital, to finalize  a trust fund aimed at compensating 7 ,396 vic-
tims of Habré’s crimes.  
The armed Islamist groups Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa 
Province (ISWAP) continued their attacks  in the Lake Chad area, targeting both 
civilians  and military forces , and causing restrictions  in humanitarian access. On 
August 21, Chad announced  it will recall half of its 1,000 troops from the G5 
Sahel Joint Force , a military force created to counter Islamist armed groups in the 
tri-border area of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.  
According to the United Nations , at least 309 people were killed, 182 injured, 
and more than 6,500 were internally displ aced during intercommunal violence in 
Chad in 2021. 
Pre-Election Violence  
Chad’s security forces cracked down  on protesters and the political opposition in 
the lead-up to the country’s April 11 presidential election. In the capital N’Dja-mena, they 
used teargas  to disperse peaceful protesters who called for political 
change and an end to social and economic injustices on February 6, February 15, March 20, and March 27 , injuring dozens of protesters and human rights ac-tivis ts, including Mahamat Nou r Ibedou, Secretary General  of the Chadian 
Human Rights Convention, a local rights group, and bystanders. They also 
arbi-
trarily arrested  at least 112 oppos ition party members and supporters and civil 
society act ivists, subjecting some to sever e beatings and other ill-treat ment.  
In an attack on the home of a political opposition leader and presidential candi-
date, Yaya Dillo, on February 28, security forces killed  his 80-yea r-old mother 
and wounded five other family members. 
Opposition parties accused  the government of using Covid-19 regulations to 
block their campaigns and b an political gatherings, including  a strict lockdown  
that was imposed in N’Dj amena from January 1 to March 10. 
148WORLD REPORT 2022Post-Election Violence  
Security forces used excessive force , including indiscriminate live ammunition, 
to disperse opposition-led demonstrations ac ross Chad in the aftermath of the 
April 11 election and Déby’s subsequent death.  
Members and su pporters of oppo sition parties and civil society or ganizations 
united under a coalition known as  Wakit Tamma  (“the time has c ome” in Cha-
dian Arabic) and other residents demonstrated in N’Djamena, Moundou, Doba, and other cities across the country, on April 27 and 28, and May 8 and 19, chal-lenging the transitional military council’s ban on demonstrations and demand-ing a transition to civili an rule.  
During protests, at least seven people were killed, dozens were wounded, and 
security forces arrested more than 700 people, many who reported ill-treatment and torture in detention. Among those whom security forces and other authori-ties arrested, threatened, and intimidated were injured persons being treated at 
health facilities. All those arrested were released in the following months.  
On October 2, hundreds of N’Djamena residents joined members and supporters 
of Wakit Tamma 
to protest  the TMC’s rule and seek amendments to Chad’s tran-
sitional charter. Although the authorities had authorized  this demonstration, 
anti-riot police—and in at least one case, gendarmes— fired  teargas canisters, 
rubber bullets, and potentially live ammunition at the pro testers, injuring about 
40 to 45 people and damaging private property. 
Abuses by Armed Groups  
Boko Haram and ISWAP continue to commit serious human rights abuses against civili ans in the Lake Chad  area, leading to dozens of  deaths and  a major 
humanitarian crisis. The UN said over 
400,000 people were internally displaced  
in September in the region. 
International media reported that on September 19, Boko Haram fighters killed  
nine people and burned several homes in Kadjigoroumave village, Lake Chad re-gion.   
149HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHInternational Justice  
Former Chadian dictator Hissène Habré  died  on August 24 in Dakar, where he 
was serv ing a life sentence follo wing his conv iction for serious internation al 
crimes. This followed a landmark effort to  ensure justice for his role in serious 
human rights violations. 
Habré’s government  was respons ible for widespread political killings, system-
atic torture, thousands of arbitrary arrests, and targeting of particular ethnic 
groups. Habré himself  was involved in the abuses during h is rule in Chad from 
1982 to 1990, principally by maintaining tight control over his feared political po-lice, the Documentation and Security Dir ectorate (DDS), whose members tor-
tured and killed those who opposed Habré or simply belonged to the wrong 
ethnic group. 
An appeals court confirmed Habré’s conviction in April 2017 and awarded 82 bil-
lion CFA francs (approximately US$150 million) to 7 ,396 victims, mandating an African Union Trust Fund to raise the money by searching for Habré’s assets and soliciting contributions. In Septem ber, a delegation from the African Union 
visited N’Djamena, Chad’s  capital, to 
finalize  the establishment of the Trust 
Fund, which could help pave the way for victims of his crimes to receive long sought reparations.  
Intercommunal Violence  
Intercommunal and inter-ethnic violence intensified  across Chad, especially in 
the eastern region, prim arily in ar eas wher e availability of na tural resourc es, in-
cluding water and land, is limited. Local human rights groups accused  the gov-
ernment of ignoring these conflicts and failing to prevent the violence and protect the population. 
According to the UN , at least 309 people were killed, 182 
injured, and more than 6,500 internally di splaced in intercommunal violence in 
Chad in 2021. 
On April 14 and 15, intercommunal clashes  between herders and farmers in Am-
Barid and Siheb, Salamat province, led to over 100 deaths and 100 injured, ac-cording to the UN. On August 7 and 8, intercommunal clashes caused by a 
conflict over land between local farmers and herders in Hadier Lamis province 
150WORLD REPORT 2022led to the death of at least 25 people , according to international media. Inter-
communal violence between sedentar y farmers and nomadic herders  killed at 
least 28  people on September 19 and 20 in the villages of Kidji-Mina and Tiyo, 
eastern Chad, according to international media and local human rights groups. 
151HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHChile 
Chile has tak en initial steps to reform the n ational polic e, the Carabineros, 
prompted by complaints of serious abuses  against protesters in 2019. Substan-
tial changes to the police disciplinary system and protocols are still needed. 
In October 2020, Chileans voted to establish a convention to write a new consti-
tution. Members began work in July 2021 and have a year to present a new text, which is to be submitted to  popular plebiscite.  
Chile faces important human rights challenges related to prison conditions, ac-
countability for past abuses, and  protecting the rights of migrants, refugees, 
women, children, Indigenous people, and lesbi an, gay, bisexual, and transgen-
der (LGBT) people. 
Police Reform 
Hundreds of comp laints of  use of exce ssive fo rce against protesters  and il l-treat-
ment of detainees since 2019 have prompt ed efforts to reform the police. 
The Chilean National Human Rights Institute (INDH) reported 460 cases of eye in-
juries allegedly caused by police fr om October 2019 through March 2020. The 
Salvador Hospital in Santiago reported treating 182 cases of ocular trauma caused by kinetic impact pr ojectiles that appeared to  have been fired by police 
anti-riot guns between October and November 2019. 
In November 2019, at Human Rights Watch’s recommendation, the Carabineros 
temporarily suspended the use of anti-riot shotguns—which use less lethal am-
munition— except when there was risk to life. In July 2020, however, the Cara-
bineros updated its protocol on these s hotguns in a way that leaves ample room 
for abuse. The protocol says their use s hould be “preferably,” but not exclu-
sively, defensive; it also allows the use of shotguns in defense of police stations, 
which could include when protesters throw rocks at a police building. The proto-
col does not specify what type of less lethal ammunition may be used, thus al-
lowing the same type of kinetic impact proj ectiles that caused  hundreds of eye 
injuries in 2019 and 2020; does not say at what distance from protesters police 
152WORLD REPORT 2022should shoot; and in some circumstances  even allows shooting anywhere on the 
body.  
In January 2020, the Carabineros  adopted a protoc ol on body came ras that gives 
officers complete control to start and stop recording. It requires them to start 
recording right before they open fire with an anti-riot shotgun, meaning they 
would not record a video of the prior situation, which could show whether the use of forc e was permissib le or not. The protocol also est ablishes th at record-
ings are to be kept secre t, even from victims  of excessive  police force, unless 
prosecutors or judges request access within a short 30-day period, after which 
most recordings will be deleted.
 
The Ministry of  Interior has met with nongov ernmental or ganizations (NGOs), ex-
perts, and the Carabineros to dis cuss amending police pr otocols, including a 
2019 protocol  that al lows the police to add teargas to wa ter cannons  without 
having previously performed a public study on its health impact. 
The government has also introduced sev eral police re form bills that would in-
crease oversight and transparency but do not overhaul the Carabineros’ discipli-
nary regime, which does not guar antee independent and impartial 
investigations. 
The Attorney General’s Office launched 8,581 investigations on alleged police 
abuses committed from October 2019 to March 2020. By January 2021, it had closed more than 35 percent of them without  pressing charges. As of September, 
only five Carabineros had been convicted, the National Human Rights Institute reported.
 
Carabineros opened 1,433 administrative investigations for involvement “in acts 
of violence,” which resulted in 158 di sciplinary punishments, including the firing 
of 22 police officers, it said in July. Carabineros said it is considering firing an-other 21 officers. 
Confronting Past Abuses 
Chilean courts continue to try agents of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship (1973-1990) for human rights abuses. In January 2 021, four former military officers and 
a former police officer were convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for two 
153HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmurders and five attempted  murders of detainees poisoned in 1981, which the 
court considered part of a “systematic” policy of repress ion and crimes against 
humanity. 
Migrants and Refugees’ Rights 
In April 2021, Congress passed a new immigration law that allows authorities to issue deportation orders without hearing migrants or giving them the chance to present evidence. Although the law decriminaliz es undocumented entry into the 
country, it allows for the immediat e expulsion of  migrants who crossed the bor-
der or were trying to cross the border, raising concerns about due process. Some of the law’s provis ions have alre ady entered  into effect, while others require the 
Ministry of Interior to issue regulations.  
From January through April, the government  had deported 294 people, most 
without judicial review, and announced plans to deport a total of 1,500 by year’s end.
 
A series of rulings by Chile’s Supreme Court and appeal courts have ordered au-
thorities to stop hundreds of deportations. The rulings have exposed violations 
of due process in deportations. 
Most people deported in 2021, up to October, were Venezuelans. More than 457 ,000 Venezuelans are estimated to be living in Chile, most with legal status. But migration policie s since 2019 have made it inc reasingly diffi cult for Venezue-
lans to obtain visas or asylum. Chile only granted refugee status to 3 Venezue-lans, out of 325 applications, in 2020, and to 4 out of 987 in 2021, as of September. The relatively low number of  applications appears to be the result of 
obstacles to apply and border closures.
 
From January through November 10, 20 migr ants had died crossing the high-alti-
tude border from Bolivia to Chile.  
In September, Carabineros evicted Venezuelans from a square in the northern 
city of Iquique, during which there were some acts of violence. The next day, anti-migrant protesters burned personal belongings of Venezuelans living in the 
streets.
 
154WORLD REPORT 2022Women’s and Girls’ Rights 
Chile’s 28-year to tal abortion ban ended in 2017 , when the Constitution al Court 
upheld a law decriminalizing abortion when the life of a pregnant woman is at risk, the fetus is unviable, or a pregnancy results from rape.  
However, people seeking safe and legal abortions continue to face multiple bar-
riers. The latest government data available, from 2019, shows that 18 percent of obstetricians in public hospitals refuse to perform abortions when the life of a woman is at risk; 25 percent when the fetus is unviable; and almost 50 percent in cases of rape.
 
In November 2021, the House of Represent atives rejected a bill to decriminalize 
abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy.  
According to the coalition of NGOs Mesa de Acción por el Aborto, the public 
health system rest ricted access to comprehen sive sex ual and r eproduct ive 
health services like pap tests, mammograms, and medical care for sexually 
transmitted infections for some periods of the pandemic, but resumed providing 
them at the beginning of 2021. 
Thirty-three women and girls were v ictims of femicide from January through mid-
September 2021, the NGO Women’s Network Against Violence Against Women 
reported. Legislation in 2020 expanded the definition of femicide to a killing committed for “gender motives,” without  requiring a relationship between the 
perpetra tor and the v ictim, as was previo usly the case.
 
Indigenous Rights 
In May 2021, 1.2 million Indigenous voters select ed representatives for 17 seats 
at the constitutional conv ention reserved for Indigenous people. 
In July, the constitutional convention chose as its president Elisa Loncón of the 
Mapuche people, the largest Indigenous group in Chile, with more than 1 million 
members. 
Indigenous movements want the new constitution to recognize Indigenous peo-ples as nations within a plurinational Chile, as well as their rights to land and re-sources.  
155HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHLong-standing conflict between the government and some Mapuche land-rights 
activis ts in the south continues. In October, a former Carabiner o colonel was 
found guilty of ki lling a 17 -year-old Ma puche boy, almost two decades after the 
death had taken place.  
In October, President Sebastián Piñera dec lared a state of emergency in four 
southern provinces, citing incr easing violence linked to  drug traffick ing, terror-
ism, and organized crime. More than 2,000 military personnel were sent to sup-port police activities. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
In December 2021, Congress approved a bill, prioritized by President Piñera, which legalizes marriage betw een same-sex couples and also recognizes rights 
enjoyed by heterosexual couples, like the right to adopt children. 
In August, a law eliminating “homosexual c onduct” as grounds for divorce came 
into effect. 
Children’s Rights 
In August 2021, a judge pre sented before the Senate comm ission on children’s 
rights complaints of sexual exploitation and  human rights violations in a shelter 
for children separated from their families run by the National Service for Minors 
(SENAME) in Santiago. 
In October, a new National Specialized Pr otection Service for Children and Ado-
lescents took over SENAME’s child protection programs. A pending bill would also create a new agency to handle children in conflict with the law, replacing SENAME. Human rights organizations have raised concerns that, despite institu-tional changes, substantial reform to improve care for children is lacking.
 
Covid-19 
More than 80 percent of Chileans were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of 
November 8, 2021, one of the highest rates in the world.  
156WORLD REPORT 2022In March 2020, schools closed to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus, affecting 
3.5 million students. The Ministry of Education provided educational content through an online platform, but acknowledged that  only 27 percent of low-in-
come students had access to online education. In-person education resumed in July 2021, although, as of Octo ber, attendanc e was not m andatory and  remained 
low.
 
Disability Rights 
Chile’s civil code uses  derogatory language about peop le with disabi lities and in 
many cases strips them of their legal capacity, including by providing for full guardianship of them. 
The government has not updated data about the number of  people with disabili-
ties since 2015.
 
Prison Conditions and Pretrial Detention 
Overcrowding in some detention c enters and prison violenc e endangered Chile’s 
detainee population of 39,000 as of October 31, 2021. Homicides in prisons in-creased by 75 percent from 2017 through 2020, the Attorney General’s Office said in September 2021. 
In May, the government reported that around 1,800 detainees belonging to 
groups at higher risk from Covid-19 had been granted house arrest based on an April 2020 law.
 
The number of pret rial detainees has increased by about a third since 2012. As 
of August, 37 percent of detainees were awaiting trial. Chile’s criminal code al-lows pretrial detention in broad circumstances and does not establish a maxi-mum period for detention.
 
In December 2020, the Minister of Justic e acknowledged that pretrial detention 
is used excessively . He said th at about 40 per cent of pr etrial detainees are later 
found innocent or given sentences not  compatible with pretrial detention. 
157HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFreedom of Speech 
In November 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled unconstitutional a bill passed 
by the House of Representatives to c riminalize speech of people who “justify,” 
“approve of,” or “deny” human rights violations during the dictatorship, finding it violated the freedom to express op inions without prior censorship. The Senate 
then had to drop the bill. 
Key International Actors 
In April 2021, the UN Committee on the Pr otection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families expressed concern that Chile had ex-pelled migr ants en mas se in February, failing to ex amine each case and making 
appeals materially impossible. 
Chile strongly criticiz ed abuses by the Nicolás Maduro  government in Venezuela 
and, with other members of the Lima Group, a group of Latin American countries calling to restore democracy in Venezuela, refused to recognize the flawed leg-islative elections of December 2020. 
Chile denounced arbitrary detention of  presidential candidates, students, and 
members of civil society org anizations in Nicaragua, and  called for free and fair 
elections there. 
President Piñera committed, in August, to receiving 10 Afghan women with their 
families in the context of  the cr isis aff ecting their country. The Foreign Ministry 
told the press it  was work ing to rece ive up to  300 Afghans. 
158WORLD REPORT 2022China 
With President Xi Jinping at the helm, the Chinese government doubled down on 
repression inside and outside the country in 2021. Its “zero-tolerance” policy to-
wards Covid-19 strengthened the authorities’ hand, as they imposed harsh poli-cies in the name of public health.  
Beijing’s inform ation manipulation has bec ome per vasive: the government cen-
sors, punishes dissent, propagates disinformation, and tightens the reins on 
tech giants. The once-cacophonous internet  is now dominated by pro-govern-
ment voices that report to the authorities on people whose views they deem in-
sufficiently nationalistic.  
The Chinese government pushed for more conservative values in 2021, shrinking 
space for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) and women’s rights—is-sues previously considered less sensit ive. Beijing grew less tolerant of criticism 
from private entrepreneurs. In July, cour ts imposed a sentence of 18 years on Sun 
Dawu, an agricul tural tycoon supportive  of rights act ivists, for vague crimes, 
after handing down a similarly harsh sentence to Ren Zhiqiang, an outspoken 
real estate mogul. 
Xi’s latest promise to tackle inequality and deliver “common prosperity” rings 
hollow as his gov ernment suffocates g rassroots voices. After the self -immolation 
of a delivery truck driver in January, the government tightened regulatory controls 
to protect gig workers, ye t also cracked do wn on their act ivism. C hina’s rapidly 
expanding inequality led  some young people to  advocate a form of passive  re-
sistance known as “tang ping”—opting out of consumption and demeaning work—a concept that the government condemned and censored.  
Authorities de vastated human rights protections  and civil liberties in Hong Kong, 
recasting much of the peaceful behavior that had undergirded Hong Kong life, 
such as publishing news, as acts of subversion. An April 2021 report by Human Rights Watch found authorities were committing crimes against humanity as part of a widespread and systematic attack on Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, including mass det ention, tor ture, and cultural persecution. Ti betans 
continued to be subjected to grave abuses, including harsh and lengthy impris-onment for ex ercising their b asic rights.

“Break Their Lineage, Break Their Roots” 
Chinese Government Crimes against Humanity Targeting Uyghurs and Other Turkic Muslims
HUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  The Chinese government’s rights record and its “wolf warrior” diplomacy re-
sulted in increasingly negative public perceptions of the government in some countries abroad. New research from AidData revealed US$385 billion in “
hid-
den debt ” owed by developing countries to Chinese authorities. Some foreign 
governments took more concrete measures to press the Chinese government to improve its rights record, at home and abroad, but those remained inadequate to effectively challenge the scope and scale of Beijing’s abuses. 
Hong Kong  
Beijing and Hong Kong authorities mo ved aggressively  to roll ba ck rights in Hong 
Kong. 
Pro-democracy act ivists were  arbitrarily arrested and  detained. In January, au-
thorities arrested 53 politicians for “su bversion” for their involvement in a July 
2020 public opinion poll. In September , three members of the group Student 
Politicism  were arrested for “conspiracy to incite subversion” for delivering 
snacks to imprisoned protesters. Ordinar y people were arrested for public defi-
ance, such as for displaying flags bearing the banned 2019 protest slogan, “Re-claim Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.”  
At time of writing, over 150 people had been arrested for violating the draconian 
National Secu rity Law (NSL) s ince it was impo sed on June 30, 2020 . Some NSL 
suspects held in cust ody were mistre ated; pro-democracy  activist T am Tak-chi 
has been held in solitary confinement since he was detained in September 
2020.  
Authorities turned Hong Kong’s quasi-democratic institutions into rubber-stamp 
bodies. In March, Beijing imposed “electoral reforms,” requiring that only those 
loyal to the Chinese Communist Party could win a seat in Hong Kong’s legisla-ture. In April, following citizens’ calls to cast blank ballots to protest the changes, the government revised the electoral laws to prohibit “incitement of others to cast blank ballots,” with sentences of up to three years in prison. In September, when the government required elected members to the District 
Council—a consultative body that advises the government on local issues—to take a loyalty oath, about half resigned as they anticipated being disqualified by the government for their pro-democracy views. 
161HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAuthorities banned the annual Victoria Park  vigil commemorating victims of the 
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. On the day of the vigil, po lice ar-
rested the vice-chair of the organizing group, Hong Kong Alliance, cordoned off 
the park, and stationed officers throughout the c ity to prevent remembrances. In 
September, police froze the Alliance’s HK$2.2 million (US$283,000) in assets, closed its Ju ne 4th Museum about  the massacre, revoked its regi stration, 
deleted its social media accounts, and ar rested its four leaders for “inciting sub-
version.” 
Dozens of civi l society org anizations disb anded in 202 1, including protest organ-
izer Civil Human Rights Front in August and the legal aid group 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund in November. Major labor groups, including the Hong Kong Profes-sional Teachers’ Union and Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU), disbanded in August and September respectively.  
Throughout 2021, Beijing’s newspapers smeared the Hong Kong Bar Association 
and its chairperson, Paul Harris, and called for his resignation. In August, citing threats to himself and his f amily, a pro-democracy candidate 
withdrew  from a 
council election of the Law Society, a solic itors’ association. Candidates with 
Beijing ties later won . 
Authorities attacked press freedom. They forced the city’s second most popular 
newspaper, Apple Daily¸ to close in June, after arres ting its owner, Jimmy Lai, top 
executives, and editors, freezing Lai’s HK$500 million (US$64 million) worth of 
assets, and r aiding the paper’s he adquarters. Lai was also sentenced to a total 
of 14 months in prison in April for attending protests; he faced an additional six 
charges in four other cases.  
The government also transformed  the previously independent  Radio T elevis ion 
Hong Kong (RTHK). In May, it replaced the head of RTHK with Li Pak Chuen, who had no prior media experience. Li then censored  current affairs programs, pro-
hibited staff from attending press award events that honored their coverage of the 2019 protests, and fired journalists and  talk show hosts for their views criti-
cal of the government.  
Police censored the internet through website  blocking for the first time. In Janu-
ary 2021, the police ordered internet ser vice providers to block access to 
HKChronicles.com, a website that documents  police abuse but had also revealed 
162WORLD REPORT 2022personal information about police officers. In June, an Israeli hosting company 
took down the website of a Hong Kong exile initiative, 2021 Hong Kong Charter, at the request of the Hong Kong police, though it reinstated the site following an 
international outcry. In September, Hong Kong police blocked the website of the 
June 4th Museum.  
Academic freedom deteriorated. University administrations were hostile towards 
student unions throughout 2021, while a number of academics were fired, or their contracts were not renewed, because of their pro-democracy views.  
Authorities censored art, forcing theaters to pull a documentary about the 2019 
protests in March, and forcing a new museu m, M+, to pull a work by Chinese dis-
sident-artist Ai Weiwei from its opening in November.  
Xinjiang  
The Chinese authorities are committing crime s against humanity against 
Uyghurs and other Turk ic Muslims in X injiang. Abuses committ ed inc luded mass 
arbitrary  detention, tor ture, enforced dis appearances, mass surveill ance, cul-
tural and r eligious persecution, separ ation of families, forced returns  to China, 
forced labor, and sexual violence and violations of reproductive rights. Little news trickled out of Xinjiang in 2021, however, as the authorities maintained tight control over information, and as access to the region, already limited, was further constrained due to Covid-19 movement restrictions.  
Some Uyghurs  who disappeared  into Xinjiang’s  abusive  “Strike Hard Campaign 
against Violent Terrorism” were  confirmed imprisoned, including prominent aca-
demic Rahile Dawut, though her alleged crime, length of sentence, and location of imprisonment remained unclear. There were also reports of Uyghurs dying in detention, including biot ech researcher Mihriay Erkin, 31, businessman 
Yaqub 
Haji, 45, and poet and publisher Haji Mirzahid Kerimi , 82. 
A report by the Uyghur Human Rights Project showed the Xinjiang government 
dispossessed Uyghurs by confiscating $84.8 million worth of assets from 21 jailed Uyghurs and auctioning the assets online.  
Neighboring governments continued to facilitate Beijing’s abuses. In September, 
Kazakh authorities banned a Russian-American researcher, Yevgeniy Bunin, from 
163HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthe country in apparent efforts to stymie his work documenting Xinjiang’s 
abuses. Also in September, Turkey denied entry to Dolkun Isa, president of the Uyghur exile organization Uyghur World Congress. Uyghurs abroad from Afghanistan to Morocco feared deport ations to China as the Chinese government 
continued to seek their return for alleged terrorism, a term vaguely defined under 
Chinese law that encompasses peaceful expression and advocacy. 
Businesses  continued to be subjected to heightened scrutiny over their Xinjiang 
involvement. In March, Chinese consu mers boycotted int ernational clothing 
brands for vowing to st op purchasing c otton from Xinjiang due to reports of 
forced labor. In April, Shenzhen police s hut down the Chinese affi liate of a US 
labor auditing nonprofit, Verite. In July, US p hotography company Kodak deleted 
from Instagram a photographer’s post calling Xinjiang “dystopian.” The US Cus-
toms and Border Protection agency issued numerous  import bans related to Xin-
jiang, including cotton and tomatoes from Xinjiang, and all downstream 
products that use Xinjiang cotton and tomatoes manufactured outside the re-gion. There are growing calls for other count ries to impose similar bans on Xin-
jiang imports.  
Tibet  
Authorities in Tibetan ar eas c ontinue to sever ely restrict freedoms of religion, ex-
pression, movement, and assembly. They also fail to address popular concerns about mining and land grabs by local officials, which often involve intimidation 
and unlawful use of force by security forces. 
Following a November 2020 announcement tightening controls on online com-
munications th at “undermine n ational u nity,” there was a surge of reported de-
tentions of Tibetans in 2021 for alleged  online offenses. In particular, Tibetans 
who communicated w ith people outside China were ha rassed and pu nished, re-
gardless of the content of their communications. 
The government st epped up coer cive assimil ationist polic ies. Chinese language 
classes were already compulsory for schoolteachers, local officials, and voca-tional trainees. In July, authorities announced that kindergartens in ethnic mi-nority ar eas must use C hinese as a medium of ins truction. In August , President 
164WORLD REPORT 2022Xi emphasized the subordination of  minority identities to a single nation al iden-
tity at the national “Ethnic Work” conference. 
Authorities’ heightened surveillance and intimidation  at all levels, from online to 
neighborhoods to schools, and have render ed protests—such as those over the 
downgrading of minority language in Inner Mongolia in 2020—virtually impossi-ble in Tibetan areas. 
At least eight Tibetan prisoners or suspects were released due to ill health, some 
due to torture, four of whom died soon after, though the true number is unknown due to extreme information controls in Tibet. 
Covid-19  
Authorities continued to detain or prosecut e people for criticizing the govern-
ment’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Between January 2020 and June 2021, the Twitter account SpeechFreedomCN 
recorded at least 663 arrests  for 
Covid-19-rel ated speech. In March, retired professor C hen Zha ozhi was put on 
trial on charges of “pic king quarrels and provoking trouble” for posting on social 
media, “The Wuhan pneumonia is not a Chine se virus, but Chinese Communist 
Party virus.” 
In August, a Beijing court sentenced activists Chen Mei and Cai Wei  to 15 months 
in prison after convicting them of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” They 
were detained in April 2020, for archiv ing censored online articles and social 
media posts about the pandemic. In the same month, imprisoned citizen jour-nalist Zhang Zhan became seriously ill following a hunger strike. In December 2020, Zhang was sentenced to four yea rs in prison aft er travelling to  Wuhan to 
document the p andemic in February. C itizen journ alist F ang Bin, who was de-
tained in April 20 20 in Wuhan, rem ained m issing.  
In 2021, authorities launched a nationwide vaccination campaign. Though the 
central government insists that the scheme is voluntary, many complained on-line about local authoritie s’ abusive  tactics to drive up  vaccination rates. In 
some cases, the police physically restrained  people to forcibly inoculate them; 
in others, authorities announced that they would suspend government benefits for anyone who refused vaccination or conditioned school enrollment on the vac-
cination of the st udent’s entire family. Vaccine sa fety activist He Fangmei, taken

peared.  
Human Rights Defenders  
Authorities continued to crack down on human right defenders . Police in Hunan 
province detained  activist Ou Biaofeng in December 2020, and lat er charged him 
with “inciting su bvers ion.” Ou has been an outspoken critic of  the Chinese gov-
ernment and a su pporter of Dong Yaoqiong, who was held in a psychi atric hospi-
tal for over a year after she splashed ink on a poster of President Xi in 2018. In February, Dong was reporte dly taken into a psychiat ric hospital again after she 
posted on Twitter about being subjected to police surveillance.  
In January 2021, a court in Guizhou province sentenced former journalist Zhang 
Jialong to one-and-a-half years in prison f or “picking quarrels and provoking 
trouble” for criticizing the government’s censorship and urging the US to help “tear down” the Great Firewall in a 2014 meeting with then-US Secretary of State 
John Kerry. 
In April, Beijing police detained  food delive ry worker and  labor activist 
Chen 
Guojiang , accusing him of “picking quarrels and  provoking trouble” after he tried 
to unionize delivery workers, undermining the government’s vow to protect gig 
workers from danger ous working conditions. 
In May, Guangzhou police detained hum an rights act ivist and  writer Wang 
Aizhong on suspicion of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” 
In July, a court in Hebei province sent enced outspoken agri cultural mogul Sun 
Dawu to 18 years in prison on charges including “picking quarrels and provoking 
trouble” and “as sembling a crowd to  attack stat e agencies.” Su n was al so a 
longtime supporter of human rights  activis ts and la wyers.  
In August, a court in Anhui province sentenc ed activist Zhou Weilin  to three-and-
a-half years in prison for his tweets critic al of the government and articles he 
wrote for the overseas-based  Rights Defense Network website.  
Also in August, Cheng Yuan, Liu Yongze, and Wu Gejianxiong, the founder and 
two staff members of the anti-discrimination group Changsha Funeng, were sen-
167HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtenced to between two and five years in prison in a secret trial. Authorities de-
tained the three in July 2019, on charges of “subversion.” 
In September, prominent rights lawyers Ding Ji axi and Xu Zhiyong were indicted 
for “subvers ion.” Authorities detained  the act ivists in la te 2019 and early 2020, 
for participating a gathering where attendee s discussed human rights and 
China’s political future. In February, Beijing police detained Li Qiaochu, a women’s and l abor rights act ivist, and pa rtner of Xu, charging her w ith “subver-
sion.” While in detention, Li was taken to  a hospital several times for treatment 
of mental and physical illnesses.  
Also in September, the authorities forcibly disappeared Huang Xueqin, a journal-
ist and leading voice in China’s #MeToo movement, and Wang Jianbing, a labor activist.  In the same month, detained  human rights lawy er Chang W eiping was 
allowed by authorities to meet with his lawyer for the first time since he was forcibly disappeared in 2020. 
Freedom of Expression  
Authoritie s harassed, detained , or prosecuted  numerous people for their online 
posts and private chat messages critical of the government, bringing trumped-up charges of “spreading ru mors,” “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” and 
“insulting the country’s leaders.” A 2021 Wall Street Journal  report found that 58 
Chinese users were punished w ith prison sentences between six months and 
four years since 2017 for their posts on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube—all plat-forms banned in China.  
An increasing number of people were puni shed for speeche s deemed “unpatri-
otic.” In February, at least seven people were detained for comments in relation to the border clash with Indian troops. In March, the government passed a provi-
sion stipulating that slandering “heroes and martyrs” could be punished with up to three years in prison. Former jour nalist Qiu Z iming was sent enced to the an 
eight-month prison term for suggesting the real  death toll of Chinese soldiers in 
the clash was higher than the officia l figure.   
Authorities continued to suppress online content not in line with “
core socialist 
values .” They targeted “misbehaving” celebrities  and their online fan groups, 
and banned some reality shows. In April, censors deleted from WeChat and other 
168WORLD REPORT 2022websites an article penned by former premier Wen Jiaobao in which he wrote, 
“China, in my vision, should be a country of justice and fairness.” 
In December 2020, the Beijing police detained Haze Fan, a journalist for 
Bloomberg News, on suspicion of endangering national security. In July, the 
Communist Y outh League encouraged  the ha rassment and doxing of foreign jour-
nalists who were covering the flood disaster in Zhengzhou.  
Freedom of Religion  
Chinese law allows people to practice only five officially recognized religions in officially approved premises, and authorities retain control over personnel ap-pointments, publications, finances, and seminary applications. Since 2016, when President Xi called for “Sinicization” of religions—which aims to ensure that the Chinese Communist Party is the arbiter of people’s sp iritual life—state 
control ov er religion has streng thened.  
In 2021, police arrested those who worshipped outside of state-sanctioned pa-
rameters. In May, a Shenzhen court sentenced  four employees from a company 
that sold audio devices broadcasting the Bible to between 15 months and six years for “operating an illegal business.” In July, five members of an unautho-rized “house church” in Shanxi province were 
detained  on suspicion of “illegally 
crossing the border” after they went to a January 2020 religious conference in 
Malaysia. In August, police took nine people involved with the Golden Lamp Church, an unauthorized “house church” in Linfen, Shanxi province, into cus-
tody. 
Authorities continued efforts  to alter the a rchitectural style of mo sques and 
landmarks to make them look more “C hinese” across the country, while Hui 
Muslim act ivists said police had harassed them for criticiz ing the policy. 
Mass Surveillance  
Authorities dev oted resources to  expanding mass surveill ance systems  nation-
wide, in the absence of  meaningful leg al protections  against unlawful or abusive 
government surveillance. Chinese companies  with reported li nks to the govern-
ment continue to draw global scrutiny for their data collection practices.

citizens to hold companies accountab le by filing a complaint with the govern-
ment or getting a government-approved organiz ation to file a lawsuit, it will un-
likely check the state’s use of mass surv eillance.  
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
March marked the fifth anniversary of the landmark Anti-Domestic Violence Law, 
yet victims continued to face an uphill battle in seek ing authorities’ protection 
and accountability for their abusers. In February, an article by former journalist 
Ma Jinyu on the violent abuses she suffered by her husband ignited a heated dis-cussion on social media about the government’s persistent failure to prosecute 
domestic violence.  
Women’s rights issues continued to face online censorship. In April, dozens of 
social media accounts  run by w omen’s rights activis ts, including those of promi-
nent feminists Xiao Meili and Liang Xiaomen, were abruptly shut down after they 
were attacked and reported by nationalistic trolls online.  
In June, the Chinese government announced that it would further relax the coun-
try’s birth quo tas from two to three children after the previous st rict “one-child” 
policy led to a demographic crisis— and human trafficking . Many women ex-
pressed concerns that without measures to increase access to equitable parental leave and caregiving, the policy change could further exacerbate gender inequality. Human Rights Watch research shows that the two-child policy, in ef-fect from 2016 to 2021, had wo rsened workplace gender discrimination. 
In September, the State Council, China’s cabinet, in its “Chinese Women’s Devel-
opment Guidelines” for 2021-2030, identified “reducing non-medically neces-sary abortions” as a step toward women’s development. Many expressed concerns that the Chinese government could further restrict reproductive rights.  
The #MeToo movement gained new traction in 2021, after more women came for-
ward to accuse well-kno wn men of se xual harass ment. In August, the Beijing po-
lice arrested Chinese-Canadi an singer Kris Wu for rape. Authorities in Hangzhou 
investigated a manager at the online c ommerce giant Alibaba after rape allega-

ual harass ment case brought  against a prominent TV host  at the state broad-
caster CCTV, after the judge refused the plaintiff’s requests to retrieve corroborating evidence, including security camera footage.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
While China dec riminalized  same-sex conduct in 1997, it still lacks laws protect-
ing people from disc rimination on the b asis of sex ual orientation or gender iden-
tity, and same-sex partnerships are not legal. The Chinese government showed 
greater rigidity towards sexual orientation and gender norms in 2021. 
In February, a court in Jiangsu province ruled in favor of a publisher that de-
scribed homosexuality as a “psychological  disorder” in a university textbook. In 
July, social media platform WeChat removed  dozens of LGBT accounts run by uni-
versity students, claiming some had broken rules on online information. In Sep-tember, the Chinese gov ernment banned “sissy” effeminate men and “abnorm al 
esthetics” in the entertainment sector. It cal led for media to establish “correct 
beauty standards” and spread “positive values.” 
Belt and Road Initiative  
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013, is the government’s tril-lion-dollar infrastructure and investment  program stretching across some 70 
countries. Some BRI projects have been criticized for lack of transparency, disre-gard of community concerns, and negative environmental impacts.  
Human Rights Watch published a report,  in August, that documented economic, 
social, and cul tural rights violations  in Cambodia resulting fr om the Lower Sesan 
2 dam’s displacement of nearly 5,000 people between 2013 and 2018 and im-pacts on the livelihoods of tens of thousands of others upstream and down-
stream. The dam was a BRI project fu nded main ly by a Chinese-st ate owned bank 
and built by a Chinese-state o wned electricity generation company.  
China Labor Watch, an NGO, 
reported , in April, that  overseas C hinese workers 
working on BRI infrastructure projects in Algeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, and other 
countries were victims of human trafficking and forced labor, including being de-
173HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHceived into working illegally, held against their will, and forced to work while in-
fected with Covid-19 in early and mid-2020.  
Climate Change Policies and Actions  
China is by far the largest emitter of greenhouse gases globally, making a major contribution to the climate cr isis that is tak ing a mounting toll on h uman rights 
around the globe. China accounts for nearly 70 percent of 
global emissions  in 
2018, although its per capita  emissions put it only in the t op 40 countries. Much 
of the consider able energy that  has f ueled China’s  economic growth comes from 
coal, driving the se em issions . It produces half of the world’s coal  and is also the 
largest importer of oil, gas, and coal.  
China is the world’s largest funder and builder of overseas co al projects , some of 
which are through the BRI. President Xi announced at the UN General Assembly in October, that China would no longer “build new coal-fired  power projects 
abroad.” China continues to develop coal projects domestically.  
In September 2020, Xi 
announced  China would reach carbon neutrality by 2060, 
and reach pe ak carbon em issions befor e 2030. Despite the se improved targets, 
the Climate Action Tracker rates China’s domestic target as “highly insufficient” to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
China also leads the world in renewable energy use and is the largest funder of 
overseas renewable projects , some of which, however, have been linked to 
human  rights abuses . China has much of the global production ca pacity for the 
materials needed for a global transition to renewable energy including wind tur-
bines, solar panels, and  minerals. Some of these materials  are reportedly 
processed in Xinjiang , raising concerns about the use of forced labor . 
China’s imports  of agricul tural c ommodities drive mor e deforestation globally 
than those of any other market—including the imports of all 27 member states of the European Union combined. This deforestation is largely 
illegal . In November, 
in a joint China-US statement  issued in the context of the global climate summit 
in Glasgow, the two countries said they would contribute to eliminating global il-legal deforestation by 
enforcing their respective laws  that ban illegal imports of 
timber. China has yet to enforce a restriction on illeg al timber imports  it adopted 
in 2019. 
174WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors  
Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States im-
posed coordinated and bilateral ta rgeted sanctions on Chinese government offi-
cials and companies responsible f or serious human rights violations, including 
international crimes, in Xinjiang. The US also imposed sanctions on several sen-
ior Hong Kong officials for imposing the National Security Law. In August, the US gave Hong Kong people in the US a temporary 18-month “safe haven.”  
In September, UN High Comm issioner for Human Rights Michelle Ba chelet ex-
pressed “regret” that the authorities had not given her meaningful access to Xin-jiang, and said that her office would issue an assessment of human rights in that region. Her announcement followed a 
joint statement of concern  by 44 govern-
ments at the 47th session of the UN Human Rights Council. A similar statement was 
delivered  by 43 governments at the UN General Assembly in October 2021. 
Parliamentarians in Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Nether-
lands, and the UK passed resolutions accusing the Chinese government of com-
mitting genocide against Uyghurs; some also called on their governments to limit participation in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The UK Parliament passed a non-binding motion supporting a diplom atic boycott of the Games. 
Members of the European P arliament halt ed the EU’s proposed C omprehen sive 
Agreement on Investment with China, citing human rights concerns, and freezing consideration of the deal for as long as they are subject to Beijing’s counter sanctions. In September, they also adopted  a recommendation for a new, more 
assertive, and better coordinated EU strategy on China, placing human rights at its core.  
EU member states continued to 
issue strong statements  of condemnation of 
China’s human rights abuses  at the UN. In July, the Eu ropean Comm ission issued 
a guidance note  to help businesses address the risk of forced labor, and, in Sep-
tember, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged  that the EU would 
introduce legislation banning goods produced through forced labor to enter the 
EU market. 
Multinational companies came under greater pressure to withdraw operations 
from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labor. Those who publicly expressed 
175HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHconcerns about that issue, including H&M and Nike, were then targeted for a 
boycott by consumers in China. 
International technology c ompanies continued to facilitate censorship in their 
operations in China. According to a May New York Times  report, Apple created a 
mechanism to proactively reject or r emove apps the company believes could run 
afoul of government censors. In June, Apple announced  that it would not roll out 
its new privacy measure, Private Relay, in China. (Apple declined to respond on the record to a Human Rights Watch letter regarding the issues.) Also in June, the New York Times  
reported  that the search engine Bing, owned by Microsoft, 
blocked image and video results for the ph rase “tank man” in countries includ-
ing the US, Germany, and Switzerland. Microsoft attributed the incident to “acci-dental human error.” LinkedIn, also owned by Microsoft, citing the need to comply with local laws, 
blocked  the profiles of some C hinese government critics 
and people associated with organizations deemed critical of the government, in-cluding a Human Rights Watch employee. In October, LinkedIn 
announced  it was 
shutting down its profession al networking service in China, citing “challenging 
operating environment.” 
Few universities in democracies took steps to protect their students’ and schol-
ars’ free speech involving criticism of the Chinese government. In Australia, 
Human Rights Watch research showed only weak efforts to push back against such problems. At the same time, none of the universities with ties to academia in Hong Kong publicly challenged Hong Kong authorities’ clear assault on aca-demic freedom—including ha rassing st udent unions  and firing pr o-democracy 
faculty—in the territory.  
Foreign Policy  
The Chinese government confirmed  its use of “hostage diplomacy” when it re-
leased two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, within hours of Canada allowing Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou—detained for alleged viola-tions of US sanctions law—to return to China.  
At the United Nations, Chinese authorities continued to push back against criti-
cism of its human rights violations. The government advanced a resolution on “combating legacies of colonialism,” and continued to present other resolu-
176WORLD REPORT 2022tions—prioritizing economic development, “mutually beneficial cooperation,” 
and “realiz ing a better life for ev eryone” (the last of whic h was w ithdrawn due to 
lack of support)—that would weaken international norms by shifting focus away from accountability for rights violations. It also blocked access to UN forums for 
civil society groups  that referred  to Taiw an as an independent co untry. 
In August and September, the Chinese go vernment moved quickly to offer sup-
port to Afghani stan’s new, abu sive Talib an-controlled  government, making clear 
its concerns that instability in that countr y should not allow for security threats 
to Xinjiang or the BRI.  
New research shows that Chinese government-linked 
disinformation campaigns  
have spread in scope, languages used, and platforms globally, including in 2021 on the origin of Covid-19. 
In response to sanctions imposed on Chine se government officials, companies, 
and agencies, in March, Chinese authorities 
accused  several EU officials and 
civil society groups  of “maliciously spread[ing] lies and d isinformation,” and im-
posed vague sanctions on them. In July, Beijing announced another round of sanctions on US-based individuals and organizations, including Human Rights Watch.

Killings of Rights Defenders in Colombia’s Remote CommunitiesHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Colombia 
The peace accord in 2016 between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) and the government ended a five-decades-long armed conflict and brought an initial  decline in violence. But conflict-r elated vio lence has since 
taken new forms, and abus es by armed grou ps, including kil lings, massacres, 
and massive forced displac ement increa sed in many r emote ar eas of Colom bia in 
2021.   
Civilians in various parts of the country suffered serious abuses at the hands of 
National Liber ation Army (ELN) guerri llas, FARC diss idents, and parami litary suc-
cessor groups. Human rights defenders, jo urnalists, Indigenous and Afro-Colom-
bian leaders, and  other community activis ts face per vasive death thre ats and 
violence. The government  has taken insufficient and  inadequate steps to protect 
them.   
Between late April and mid-June, tens of thou sands of people took to the streets 
across Colombia to protest a range of  issues, including a pr oposed tax reform, 
economic inequality, police violence, and little protection for vulnerable commu-
nities in remote areas. Police offic ers repeatedly and arbi trarily dispersed peace-
ful demonstrations  and used exce ssive, often brutal, forc e, including live 
ammunition and gender-based violence. 
The Covid-19 pandemic and measures in place to control it had a devastating im-
pact on poverty and inequality in Colombia. Almost half-a-million people fell into 
poverty in 2020, according to the government’s multi-dimensional poverty 
index, and the number of households with children who did not  attend school 
increased by almost 14 percent. 
Impunity for past abuses, barriers to land restitution for displaced people, limits 
on reproductive rights, and the extreme poverty and isolation of Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities remain important human rights concerns.  
179HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHGuerrillas and FARC Dissidents  
A minority of F ARC guerri lla fighters, known as FARC d issidents, rejected the 
terms of the peace agreement, refused to disarm, and continue to commit abuses.  
Other FARC d issidents disarmed  initially but j oined or created new groups, partly 
in response to attacks by armed groups and  others against former fighters. As of 
late September 2021, more than 290 f ormer FARC fighters had been killed in 
these attacks.   
FARC dissidents and other armed groups, including the ELN and paramilitary 
successors, have committ ed multiple “massacre s,” defined in Colom bia as the 
killing of thr ee civi lians or more in the same inc ident. OHCHR docu mented 76 
massacres in 2020—the highest figu re since 2014—and rece ived reports of 82 
more between January and September 2021. 
The ELN continued in 2021 to commit war crimes and other serious abuses 
against civili ans, including killings, forc ed displac ement, and child recruitment.   
In the southern municip ality of Argeli a, Cauca state, the ELN and FARC diss ident 
groups committ ed multiple abuses  including killing s, massacre s, and kidnap-
pings, forcing thousands to flee. Similarly , on the Pacific coast of the southern 
state of Nariño , fighting among various F ARC diss ident groups di splaced over 
23,000 people between January and mid-August.  
In Chocó state, on the western coast, fighting continued between the ELN and 
the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AGC), a group that emerged from right-wing paramilitaries. Fears of antipersonnel landmines, threats by armed 
groups, and the hazards of crossfir e prevented more than 33,000 people in 
Chocó from leaving their communities between January and September, a situa-tion known as “confinement.”  
Paramilitaries and Successors  
Between 2003 and 2006, right-wing paramilitar y organizations with close ties to 
security forces and politicians under went a deeply flawed government demobi-
lization process during which many members remained active and reorganized 
into new groups. These successor groups, most notably the AGC, continue to 
180WORLD REPORT 2022commit violations of the laws of war and serious human rights abuses including 
killings, disappearances, and rape.  
In late July 202 1, fighting between the AGC and a FARC diss ident group,  as well 
as threats by armed groups, forced over 4,000 people to flee the municipality of Ituango, in the north of Antioquia state.  
Implementation of the Justice and Peace La w of 2005, which offers reduced sen-
tences to demobilized paramilitary members who confess to their crimes, has 
been slow. Of the more than 30,000 paramilitary troops that officially demobi-lized, 4,000 have sought to exchange a confession for a reduced sentence. As of October 2020, roughly 650 had been sentenced.  
Violations by Public Security Forces  
Police officers committed serious human rights violations in response to largely 
peaceful protests across Colombia between late April and mid-June 2021. Human Rights Watch identified evidence linking the polic e to 25 killings of protesters 
and bystanders, in most cases with live ammunition. 
Hundreds of protesters were injured, some suffering likely permanent loss of vi-
sion in one eye, app arently from teargas cart ridges, s tun grenades, or kinetic im-
pact projectiles fir ed from riot guns.  
In June, the Ombudsperson’s Office reported receiving complaints of 5 cases of 
rape and over 100 cases of gender-based  violence by police officers, including 
slapping and verbal abuse. Victims included  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans-
gender (LGBT) people.  
Police officers arbitrarily detained hu ndreds of people, in some cases misusing a 
provision under Colombian law that allows them to “transfer” a person to an “as-sistance or protection center” to “protect” them or others.  
While most demonstrations were peaceful, some individuals engaged in serious 
acts of violence, including attacking po lice officers and stations. On April 29, 
several people beat up and sexually abused a woman officer when they attacked a police station in Cali. Some protesters b locked roads for prolonged periods, at 
times limiting or impeding distribution of food or circulation of ambulances.  
181HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAs of December, only two officers had been indicted and five others had been 
charged in connection with homicide s committed the protests.  
On March 21, 2020, 24 prisoners were killed and 76 injured as police guards re-
pressed a riot in La Modelo jail in Bogotá. In October 2021, the Attorney Gen-eral’s Office charged three prison officers for allegedly torturing and abusing prisoners during and after the riot.  
Violence Against Community Activists  
More than 500 human rights defenders have been killed in Colombia since 2016, making it one of the countries with the highest numbers of human rights defend-ers killed worldw ide. As of Sept ember, the Office of the UN High C ommiss ioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) had documented killings of 58 human rights defend-
ers in 2021 and was verify ing another 34 cases.  
On April 20, armed men killed Sandra Liliana Peña, an authority of the Indige-
nous Nasa community in the Laguna Siberia reserve in Cauca. Peña had received several threats by armed groups before her killing.  
Most such killings have occurred in areas where illeg al economic act ivities, such 
as drug production and tr afficking, are common. The se include Pu tumayo, 
Cauca, Valle del Cauc a, and Nariño states  in the south; the Cata tumbo r egion, on 
the border with Venezuela; and the Bajo Cauca region.  
Colombian law includes a broad range of policies, mechanisms, and laws de-
signed to prevent abuses against human rights defenders and other people at 
risk. But implementation, especially of measures established under the 2016 peace accord, has often been poor. Collect ive protection progr ams created under 
the peace accord for at-risk communities and rights groups had not been imple-mented at time of writing.    
The National Pr otection Unit has granted indiv idual protection measures to hun-
dreds of human rights defenders who ha ve reported threats, providing cell-
phones, bulletproof vests, and bodyguard s. But many murdered defenders had 
not reported threats or requested protection.   
The government has failed periodically to co nvene the Nation al Comm ission of 
Security Guarantees, which is charged with designing policies to dismantle 
182WORLD REPORT 2022armed groups responsible for kil lings of rights defenders. The c ommission has 
yielded limited results. 
Threats to Judicial Independence   
In August 2020, the Supreme Court ordered  the pretrial arrest of then-Senator 
and former President Alvaro Uribe, as pa rt of an investigation into whether he 
bribed former paramilitary fighters to  change their testimonies about his alleged 
role in the creation of paramilitary groups.  
In reaction, President Iván Duque, a protégé of Uribe, and other leaders from 
their Democratic Center party made statements  apparently intended to smear or 
intimidate the court and undermine the legitimacy  of the decis ion. Some of them 
proposed overhauling the entire court system.  
Uribe resigned from the Senate, and the Supr eme Court, which handles probes 
involving lawmakers, relinquished its jurisdiction over the case, sending the case to the Attorney General’s Office. In Aug ust 2021, prosecutor Gabriel Jaimes 
requested that the case ag ainst Uribe be closed. A judicial de cision remained 
pending at time of writing.  
Peace Negotiations and Accountability  
The peace agreement between the Colombi an government and the FARC pro-
vided for the creation of an agency charged with seeking the bodies of people who disappeared during the armed conflict; a Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), charged with trying abuses committed during the armed conflict; and a truth c ommiss ion. 
In 2021, the JEP made landmark strides in investigating and prosecuting war 
crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as in ordering the government to 
implement plans established in the peace a ccord to protect people at risk.   
In February, the JEP ordered the government to take measures to protect at-risk 
former FARC fighters, including by streng thening its response to the Ombudsper-
son’s Office’s early alerts. 
Also in February, it charged members of the former FARC Secretariat—the top 
commanders—for their role in hostage-taking and related crimes, concluding 
183HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthat the crimes were part of a FARC policy and amounted to crimes against hu-
manity. In April, the FARC commander s acknowledged their responsibility for 
these crimes. Under the peace accord, def endants who fully cooperate with the 
JEP and confess to their crimes are subject to up to eight years of “restrictions on liberty,” but no prison time.  
In April, the JEP recognized five LGBT persons as victims of abuses by FARC guer-
rillas and army soldiers, finding f or the first time that gender -based persecution 
covers persecution based on sexual orientation and gender identity. 
In July, the JEP charged several army offic ers for their role in extrajudicial execu-
tions, known as “false positive” killings, in the states of North Santander, Cesar, and La Guajira. Under pressure from superiors to show “positive” results and boost body counts, soldiers and officers abducted victims or lured them to re-mote locations under false pretenses—such  as promises of work—shot them 
dead, placed weapons on their bodies, and reported them as enemy combatants killed in action. The JEP estimates that over 6,000 people were killed in “false positives” between 2002 and 2008.  
At least 19 active and retired arm y soldiers who have testified before the JEP 
have faced threats  and ha rass ment.  
In July, the Attorney General’s Office annou nced it was seek ing homicide charges 
against General Mario Montoya Uribe, who headed the army when “false posi-
tives” reached their peak, between 2006 and 2008. But a judge in Bogotá ruled in August that only the JEP could charge Montoya for conflict-related crimes.  
Former President Uribe said in August that Colombia needed a “general 
amnesty” and a “clean slate.” Later, he proposed cutting prison sentences for 
soldiers and allowing people conv icted of a range of crimes to run for and hold 
public office—which could benefit many politicians who have been convicted of conspiring with paramilitary groups  and other offenses. At time of writing, the 
proposed legislation had not been introduced in Congress.   
The Truth Comm ission was r equired by law to present its findings in November 
2021. But in July, Dejusticia, a rights grou p, asked the Constitutional Court to ex-
tend the dead line, saying the c ommission’s work had been hampered  by the 
184WORLD REPORT 2022Covid-19 pandemic. In October, the Constitutional Court gave the Truth Commis-
sion nine more months to release its findings.  
Internal Displacement and Land Restitution  
Of a population of  49 million Colombi ans, conflict-rel ated violence has displaced 
more than 8 million since 1985, government figures show.  
The United Nations Office for the Coordin ation of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) re-
ported more than 60,000 people displaced between January and September 2021 in “mass displac ements” of 50 or more people or 10 or more families—the 
highest figure recorded since 2012.  
Municipalities and  state gov ernments often lack funding to  assist displ aced peo-
ple, and the response from the national  government  has oft en been slow and in-
sufficient. 
Implementation of land restitution under the 2011 Victims’ Law continues to 
move slowly. The la w was en acted to restore millions of  hectares left behind  by 
or stolen from internally displaced Colom bians during the conflict. As of Septem-
ber 2021, the courts had issued rulings on only 12,300 of almost 133,000 claims filed. 
Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Migrants 
Colombia has received by f ar the largest n umber of refugee s, asylum seekers, 
and migrants  fleeing the human rights and hum anitarian cr isis in V enezuela. As 
of August 2021, more than 1.8 million Venezuelans lived in Colombia.  
In a landmark decis ion, in February, P resident Duque annou nced temporary pro-
tection to Venezuelans living in Colombia, granting them 10 years of legal status. The program remains open to Venezuelans who enter Colombia legally before June 2023. 
Between March and April, more th an 5,800 people, including Venezuelans and 
Colombians who had been living in Venezuela’s Apure state, fled to Colombia’s Arauca state, escaping fighting between armed groups and Venezuelan security 
forces, as well as abuses by security forces including arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial executions.  
185HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAs in previous years, thou sands of mostly Haitian, Cuban, and African migrants 
crossed Colombia’s Darien gap into Panamá on a journey that appeared to be bound for the United States. Many have  reported abuses by armed groups while 
crossing the gap, including rape.  
Gender, Sexuality, and Gender-Based Violence  
Gender-based violence, including by armed grou ps, is widespread. Lack of train-
ing and poor implementation of treatment protocols impede timely access to medical services and create  obstacles for women and girls seek ing pos t-vio lence 
care and justice. Perpetrators of violent , gender-based crimes are rarely held ac-
countable.   
Abortion in Colombia is legal when the life or health of the pregnant person is at 
risk, the pregn ancy results from r ape, or the fetu s has c onditions incompatible 
with life outside the womb. But women and girls seeking legal abortions face many barriers.  
In September 2020, Causa Justa, a coalition of Colombian rights groups and ac-
tivis ts, filed a l awsuit before the C onstitutional Court, ask ing it to ful ly decrimi-
nalize abortion. The case remained pending at time of writing.  
Despite Colombia’s  strong legal  protections ag ainst disc rimination on the basis 
of sexual orientation and gender identity, the human rights ombudsperson and civil society  groups have rai sed concerns about  the high levels of violence 
against LGBT people. 
Indigenous Rights  
Indigenous people in Colombia endure dispropor tionate levels of poverty that 
prevent them fr om exercis ing their social and economic rights. In 202 1, at least 
32 children under age five—the majority belonging to Wayuu Indigenous commu-nities—died in La Guajira state of causes associated with malnutrition and lim-ited access to safe drinking water.  Inadequate government efforts to ensure 
adequate health care, water, and food and  the Covid-19 lockdown have exacer-
bated the Wayuu malnutrition crisis. 
186WORLD REPORT 2022Disability Rights 
In 2019, Colombia adopted Law 1996, which recognizes full legal capacity for 
people with disabilities. Legal capacity is considered a threshold right because it 
is instrumental to enjoying other rights, including the right to marry, have a fam-ily, enter into financial transactions, and exercise political rights. In 2019, a law clinic and a private citizen challenged the constitutionality of Law 1996. The Con-stitutional Court rejected the lawsuits in March and August 2021. 
Climate Policy and Impacts 
Colombia’s n ational pl an to reduce green house gas emiss ions is “highly insuffi-
cient” to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, according to  the Climate Action Tracker. The plan 
commits Colombia to reducing deforestation to 50,000 hectares per year by 2030. Government figures registered more than 170,000 hectares deforested in 2020, though preliminary data indicates a decrease during the first trimester of 2021 in relation to the previous year.  
Two-thirds of forest destruction occurs in the Amazon region, driven in large part 
by cattle ranchers and FARC diss ident groups that pressu re local res idents to log 
trees, extort farmers, promote planting of coca crops to produce cocaine, and 
threaten people who support conservation efforts.   
Two years after the government launched Operation Artemisa to combat defor-
estation, it has achieved limited results. In July  2021, Congress passed a govern-
ment-sponsored bill expanding criminal pen alties for illegal deforestation and 
other environmental crimes. 
In November, at the global climate summit in Glasgow, COP26, the Colombian 
government 
committed  to have 30 percent of the country’s territory declared a 
protected area in 2022. The figure currently stands at 15 percent. 
Climate change is causing increased temperatures and droughts—and could 
lead to extreme rainfall and flooding—requiring the government to take steps to protect at-risk populations from their foreseeable harm. The authorities’ inade-
quate response to prolonged drought in the northeastern state of La Guajira has 
187HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHundermined Indigenous Wayuu people’s access to food and water, leading to 
high rates of childhood malnutrition deaths.  
Key International Actors  
The United States, the most influential foreign actor in Colombia, approved 
US$461 million in aid to Colombia for fiscal year 2021. A portion of US military aid is subject to human rights conditions. But the US Department of State has not rigorously enforced this requirement. In July 2021, the State Department said 
Colombia had complied with human rights conditions by employing “effective methods” to prevent attacks against human rights defenders, which Human 
Rights Watch has found not to be true.  
In January, the Inter-American C ommiss ion on Human Rights ur ged Colombia to 
protect inves tigative journali st Ricardo Calderón. The comm ission noted 
Calderón had been threatened, surveilled, and  targeted f or assassin ation, but 
that authorities had failed to hold those responsible to account.  
In August, the Inter-American Court on H uman Rights ru led Colombia  was re-
sponsible for the 2000 kidnapping and rape of journalist Jineth Bedoya, while 
she was inves tigating rights viol ations committed  in La Modelo prison in Bogotá. 
In a hearing in March, Colombia’s representative requested recusal of most of the judges and left the hearing complaining of no “guarantees” of a fair trial. But the court rejected the recusal request, noting it seemed designed to undermine the work of the court.    
In June, the Inter -American Comm ission visited Colombia to document abuses in 
the context of the 2021 demonstrations, concluding, in July, that police had com-mitted “serious human rights violations,” and announcing a special mechanism to monitor the situation in Colombia. 
In August, Colombia offered to host up to 4,000 at-risk Afghans temporarily to 
enable the US to  proce ss them f or adm ission. 
In October, the Office of the Prosecutor of  the International Criminal Court closed 
its preliminary examination on Colombia after reaching a “cooperation agree-ment” with the government. Under the agreement, the government is required to 
188WORLD REPORT 2022safeguard the JEP , ensure that  it has an appropriate budget, and  prevent any in-
terference with its functions.  
At the request of the government of then-President Juan Manuel Santos, the 
United Nations Security Council estab lished a po litical m ission in 2016 to moni-
tor and verify implementation of the FARC peace accord. In May 2021, the Secu-rity Council expanded the mission’s mand ate to include the verification of 
compliance with the rulings issued by the JEP . In October 2021, the council ex-
tended the m ission’s  mandate until October 2022.  
189HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCuba 
The Cuban government continues to repress and punish virtually all forms of dis-
sent and public criticism. At the same time, Cubans continue to endure a dire economic cr isis, which impacts their social and economic rights. 
In July, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in landmark demonstrations 
protesting long-standing restrictions on rights, scar city of food and medicines, 
and the government’s response to the Co vid-19 pandemic. The government re-
sponded with brutal repression.  
Arbitrary Detention and Short-Term Imprisonment  
The government employs arbitrary detention to harass and intimidate c ritics, in-
dependent act ivists, political opponents, and others. 
Security officers rarely present arrest warrants to justify detaining critics. In 
some cases, detainees are rel eased after receiving official warnings, which pros-
ecutors may use in subsequent criminal trials to show a pattern of what they call 
“delinquent” behavior. 
Over 1,000 people, mostly peaceful demonstrators or bystanders, were detained 
during the July protests, Cuban rights groups  reported. Officers prevented people 
from protesting or reporting on the protests, arresting critics and journalists as 
they headed to demonstrations or limiting their ability to leave their homes. Many were held incommunicado for days or weeks, violently arrested or beaten, and subjected to ill-treatment during detention. 
Gabriela Zequeir a Hernández, a 17 -year-old st udent, was arrested in San Miguel 
de Padrón, Havana prov ince, as she was wa lking past a demonstration on July 
11. During detention, two female officers made her strip and squat naked five times. One of them told her to inspect her own vagina with her finger. Days later, a male officer threatened to take her and two men to the area known as the 
“pavilion,” where det ainees have conjugal visits. Officers repeatedly  woke her 
up at night for interrogations, ask ing why she had pro tested and who was “fi-
nancing” her. Days late r, she was co nvicted and  sentenced to eight months in 
prison for “public  disorder,” though she was allowed to  serve her sentence in 
190WORLD REPORT 2022house arrest. She was only permitted to see her pr ivate lawy er a few minutes be-
fore the hearing.  
In October 2021, Cuban authorities said  that a demonstration being organized 
by a group of ar tists and diss idents for Novem ber 27 was “unlaw ful.” Later that 
month, the Attorney General’s Office released a statement “warning” people that they would face criminal prosecution if they “insisted” on carrying out a demon-stration on November 27.  
Cuban officers have also systematically detained independent journalists and 
artists. Victims include members of the coalition of artists known as the “San Isidro,” “27N,” and “Archipelago” movements, two coalitions of independent artists, as well as those involved in “Motherl and and Life”—a viral song that re-
purposes the Cuban government’s old slogan, “Motherland or Death” (Patria o 
Muerte) and criticizes repression in the country. 
In many cases, police and intelligence offic ers appeared at critics’ homes, order-
ing them to stay there, often for days or w eeks, in what amounted to arbitrary 
deprivations of liberty. 
Officers have repeatedly used regul ations designed to prevent the spread of 
Covid-19 to ha rass and  imprison go vernment critics.  
Freedom of Expression  
The government controls virtually all media in Cuba and restricts access to out-
side information.   
In February and August 2021, the Cuban government expanded the number of 
permitted private economic activities, yet independent journalism remained for-bidden.   
Journalists, bloggers, social media influenc ers, artists, and academics who pub-
lish information considered critical of  the government are routinely subject to 
harass ment, violence, smear campaigns, travel rest rictions, internet c uts, online 
harass ment, raids on homes and offices, confiscation of working ma terials, and 
arbitrary arrests. They are r egularly held incommunicado.  
191HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn 2017 , Cuba announced it would gradually expand home internet services. In 
2019, new regulations allowed import ation of routers and other equipment, and 
creation of private wired and Wi-Fi internet networks in homes and businesses. 
Increased access to  the internet has enabled many to communicate, report on 
abuses, and organize protests in ways virtually impossible a few years ago. 
Some journalists and bloggers manage to publish articles, videos, and news on 
websites and social media, such as Twitter and Facebook. Yet the high cost of—and limited access to—the internet prevents all but a small fraction of Cubans 
from reading independent news websites and blogs. 
The government routinely blocks access to many news websites and blogs within 
Cuba and has r epeatedly  imposed targeted  restrictions on c ritics’ access to cell-
phone data. On July 11, 2021, when the protests began, several organizations re-ported countrywide internet outages, followed by erratic connectivity, including restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. 
On August 17 , the government published  Decree-Law 35/2021 regulating the use 
of telecommunications. The decree, which sta tes its purpose is to “defend” the 
Cuban revolution, requires providers to interrupt, suspend, or terminate services 
when a user publishes information that is “fake” or affects “public morality” and “respect for public order.” 
A “cybersecurity” resolution a ccompanying Decree-Law 35 contains sweeping 
provisions labeling protected s peech—including publications that “incite 
protests,” “promote social indiscipline,” and “slander that impacts the prestige 
of the country”—as “incidents of cybersec urity” that authorities are required to 
“prevent” and “eradicate.” 
Pre-existing Decree-Law 370/2018 still proh ibits dissemination of information 
“contrary to the social interest, moral s, good manners and integrity of people.” 
Authorities have used it to interrogate and fine journalists and critics and confis-
cate their working materials.  
Political Prisoners 
Prisoners Defenders, a M adrid-based rights group, reported that, as of Septem-
ber, Cuba was ho lding 251 people who met the definition of political  prisoners, 
192WORLD REPORT 2022as well as 38 others for their political beliefs; another 92 who had been con-
victed for political beliefs were under house arrest or on conditional release.  
Cubans who criticize the government risk criminal prosecution. They do not ben-
efit from due process guarantees, such as the right to fair and public hearings by 
a competent, independent and impartial tribuna l. In practice, courts are subordi-
nate to the executive branch. 
Many people who protested peacefully in July were sentenced through “sum-
mary” criminal trials that lacked  basic due process guarantees, including the 
right to legal representation. Protesters were often tried for vaguely defined crimes, such as “public disorder” and “contempt.” In August, authorities said 66 people had been convicted in connection with protests; most did not have a lawyer. Some were acquitted on appeal.    
In some cases, authorities sought or imposed disproportionate prison sentences 
against protesters whom they accused of engaging in violence, often by throwing rocks during protests.  
On July 11, officers arrested José Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Cuban Patriotic 
Union, the main oppos ition party, as he was he ading to a demonstr ation. On July 
17 , a prosecutor sent him to pre-trial  detention, charged with “public disorder” 
for “deciding to join” the demonstrations. In Apri l 2020, Ferrer had been arbitrar-
ily sentenced to four-and-a-half years of “restrictions on freedom,” for alleged “assault.” On August 14, 2021, a Santiago de Cuba court required him to serve 4 years and 14 days in prison, ruling he had failed to “strictly respect the laws” and “have an honest attitude toward work,” legal conditions for people sen-tenced to “restrictions on freedom.” 
Several artists, including Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara and Maykel Castillo, both 
of whom performed in the music video for “Motherland and Life,” remained in pretrial detention, facing arbitra ry prosecution, at time of writing.  
Travel Restrictions 
Since reforms in 2013, ma ny people who had previo usly been denied permiss ion 
to travel to and from Cuba have been able to do so, including human rights de-fenders and bloggers. The reforms, however,  gave the government broad discre-
193HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtionary power to restrict travel on grou nds of “defense and national security” or 
“other reasons of public interest.” Authorities continue to selectively deny exit to dissenters. 
In March 2021, Cuban authorities denied Karla Pérez, a Cuban journalist study-
ing in Costa Rica, the possibility of returning home. An airline employee in-formed her during a stopover in Panama City that the Cuban government was 
refusing her adm ission. Pérez returned to Costa Rica, where she was granted 
refugee status. 
Prison Conditions 
Prisons are often overcrowded. Detainees have no effective complaint mecha-
nism to seek redress for abuses. Those who criticize the government or engage 
in hunger strikes or other forms of protest  often endure extended solitary con-
finement, beatings, rest riction of family  visits, and denial  of medical care. 
The government continues to deny internation al human rights groups and inde-
pendent Cuban organizations access to its prisons. 
In April 2020, to reduce the risk of the Covid-19 virus spreading in prisons, the 
government suspended family visits. This, coup led with authorities’ refusal to 
allow detainees to call their families, left many arrested during demonstrations 
incommunicado for days and, in some cases, weeks.  
Labor Rights 
Despite updating its Labor Code in 2014, Cuba violates International Labour Or-ganization standards  it has r atified on freedom of associ ation and col lective bar-
gaining. While Cuban law allows the formation of independent unions, in practice the government only permits the operation of one confederation of state-controlled unions, the Workers’ Central Union of Cuba. 
Cuba deploys tens of thousands of he alth workers abroad every year to help 
tackle short-term crises and natural disaste rs. They provide v aluable services to 
many communities but under Cuban ru les that violate their rights, including to 
privacy, liberty, movement, and freedom of expression and association. In 2020, 
Cuba sent some 4,000 doctors to help nearly 40 countries respond to the Covid-19 pandemic; they joined 28,000 health workers already deployed. 
194WORLD REPORT 2022Human Rights Defenders 
The government refuses to recognize human rights monitoring as a legitimate ac-
tivity and denies legal st atus to loc al rights grou ps. Authorities have harassed, 
assaulted, and imprisoned human rights defenders attempting to document 
abuses.  
In August, two officers appeared at the Havana home of the mother of Laritza Di-
versent, a human rights defender living in the United States, and threatened to 
prosecute Diversent and seek her extradition to Cuba. Diversent heads Cubalex, 
one of the main rights groups documenting abuses against people who demon-strated in July.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
The 2019 constitution explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orien-tation and gender identity. However, many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgen-der (LGBT) people suffer violence and discrimination, particularly in Cuba’s interior.  
Early drafts of the constitution approved in February 2019 redefined marriage to 
include same-sex couples, bu t the government withdrew that proposal following 
public protests. The government said it wo uld introduce a reform to the Family 
Code, which governs marriage, for legislative review and later carry on a referen-
dum. In September 2021, the government made public a draft of the reform, which included a gender-neutral definition of marriage. It had not been ap-proved at time of writing. 
Sexual and Reproductive Rights  
Cuba decriminalized abortion in 1965 and remains one of the few Latin American countries with such a policy. The procedure is available and free at public hospi-tals. 
195HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHKey International Actors  
The US embargo continues to provide the Cuban government with an excuse for 
problems, a pretext for abuses, and sy mpathy from governments that might oth-
erwise more rigorously condemn repre ssive practices in the country.  
In June 2021, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to con-
demn the embargo, for the 29th consecutive year; 184 countries supported the resolution, while the US and Israel opposed  it, and Brazil, Colombia, and 
Ukraine abstained.  
Under former President Donald Trump, the US government limited peoples’ abil-
ity to send remittances to Cuba from the US and imposed new restrictions on travelling to Cuba, banning cruise ship stops, educational trips, and most flights. In January 2021, the Trump administration designated Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, arguing that it had re fused to extradite to Colombia mem-
bers of the National Liberation Army (ELN) who had travelled to Havana to con-duct peace ta lks w ith the Colombian go vernment and  stayed  there.  
In July 2021, the administration of US President Joe Biden condemned Cuban 
government abuses against protesters and imposed targeted sanctions on sev-
eral officers credibly linked to rep ression against demonstrations. However, as of 
September, the US had not taken significant steps away from the broader policy of isolation th at was entr enched during the Tru mp era and has failed to improve 
human rights conditions in Cuba.  
In February, the European Union held a human rights dialogue with Cuba. EU 
High Representative Josep Borrell said in July that demonstrations in Cuba “re-
flect[ed] legitimate grievances.” He expressed concern about government re-pression and urged Cuba to release all arbitrarily detained protesters. The 
European Parliament adopted resolutions deploring Cuba’s human rights viola-
tions in June and September. 
The Lithuanian legislature voted in July to oppose ratification of the EU’s Political 
Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement with Cuba, signed in 2016 but never rati-fied, because of Lithuania’s human rights concerns. 
Since being elected to the UN Human Rights Council in 2020—its fifth term in the 
past 15 years—C uba has opposed resolutions  spotlighting human rights abuses 
in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Syria, and Nicaragua, among other countries. 
196WORLD REPORT 2022Democratic Republic of Congo 
The collapse of President Felix Tshisekedi’s alliance with former President Joseph 
Kabila’s coalition in December 2020 created new opportunities to push forward with stalled reform efforts, but progre ss on systemic reforms and improvements 
in the human rights and humanitarian situations were limited. 
In eastern Congo, fighters from armed gr oups, and in some cases government 
security forces, c arried out massacres, k idnappings, sex ual violence, recruit ment 
of children, and  other attac ks on civilians with near tota l impunity. 
To address insecurity in the east, the president in May 2021 imposed military 
rule in North Kivu and Ituri, two of the provinces worst affected by violence. Some officers with records of abuse remained in command positions. Martial law and new military operations 
did not improve  civili an protection. Att acks on civil-
ians by armed groups and government forces continued, with some 905 people 
killed  between May and October across Ituri and North Kivu. The Allied Demo-
cratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist armed group led by Ugandans, have been al-legedly responsible for more than half the killings. 
In 2021, the authorities often cracked down on dissenting voices, including 
human rights and  democracy act ivists, journalists, and peace ful protesters. Ten-
sions escalated in the capital, Kinshasa, with the establishment of a controver-sial new elector al commiss ion, due to alleged po litical interferenc e, and debates 
over a proposed new law, known as the “C ongolité Bill,” that would ban Con-
golese citizens with a parent of foreign origin from higher office. Supporters of 
Tshisekedi’s Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party physically attacked Catholic churches and priest s for their role in pushing for a more inde-
pendent elector al commiss ion president. 
Over 5 million people were internal ly displaced. One in three people 
suffered  
from acute hunger. School closures due to  the Covid-19 pandemic affected 19.2 
million children. After the p andemic’s start in 2020, schools were fully or par-
tially closed for 179 days, including several weeks in early 2021.  
197HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFreedom of Expression, Peaceful Assembly, and Media 
Journalis ts, act ivists, whistleblower s, and criti cs of go vernment po licies were in-
timidated and threatened, beaten, arrested,  and in some cases prosecuted by 
the authorities and security forces. 
In January, a military court  acquitted  eight members of Lucha ( Lutte pour le 
Changement, Struggle for Change), a citizens’ movement, after they spent a 
month in detention for peacefully marching in Beni territory. In July, two other 
members, Eli sée Lwa tumba and Eric Muhindo , who had been detained  for three 
months following a peaceful march in Butembo, were provisionally released . Au-
thorities arrested Parfait Muhani and Ghislain Muhiwa, also members of Lucha, in July and August respectively. They were both detained at Goma’s central prison before being released on bail on November 6. Their trial on criminal defamation and c riminal as sociation charges was started on November 5 after 
their group denounced misappropriation of aid allegedly involving staff from Congo’s first lady’s foundation. 
In February, authorities 
arrested  three members of the citizens’ movement Jicho 
ya Raiya in North Kivu’s M asisi t erritory, after they  criticiz ed the mi sman agement 
of local health structures. At time of writing, Claude Lwaboshi Buhazi, Serge Mikindo Waso, and Faustin Ombeni Tulin abo remained in pretrial detention in 
Goma’s central prison. 
In late Februar y, it was 
revealed  that authorities had sentenced whistleblowers 
Gradi Koko and Navy Malela to de ath in absentia in September 2020. The two 
former bank employees exposed alleged illegal financial practices and money laundering. In July, exiled anti-corruption whistleblower 
Jean-Jacques Lumumba  
faced threats and intimidation in Europe and Kinshasa. 
Jacky Ndala , a youth leader for the political party Ensemble pour la République 
(Together for the Repub lic), was sent enced on appeal  to 22 months in prison for 
“incitement to civil diso bedience” after public ly oppos ing the disc riminatory 
“Congolité Bill.”  
Authorities also banned demonstrations, while secu rity forces u sed excessive 
force to break them up. In April, police killed five people and wounded at least eight others during peaceful protests in Goma, Butembo, and Beni territory. Fol-
198WORLD REPORT 2022lowing the protests, security forces and  violent mobs in Nyiragongo territory, 
North Kivu, killed at least 10 people and injured at least 50 others. 
On April 29, dozens of students calling for peace were violently  accosted  and 
rounded up by police forces in Beni. Tshisekedi later apologized  to all children 
involved, but only after he  appointed  the police commander in charge of the 
round-up, François Kabeya, as mayor of Goma. 
Attacks on Civilians by Armed Groups and Government Forces 
Around 120 non-state armed groups were active in eastern Congo’s Ituri, North 
Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika prov inces. Many of their commanders have 
been implicated in w ar crimes, including massacres, sexual violence against 
women and girls, forced recruitment  of children, and pillage.  
Various armed personnel, some u nidentified, killed at leas t 1,600 civili ans in 
South Kivu, North Kivu, and Ituri province s, according to data collected by 
the Kivu Security Tracker , which documents violence in eastern Congo. This in-
cludes at leas t 172 civilians killed by Congolese secu rity forces. 
Congolese security forces conducted oper ations against armed groups in eastern 
Congo, with mixed results and at times using militia as proxy forces against other 
groups. United Nations peacekeepers supported national troops in joint opera-tions against the ADF. 
Tension remained high in 
South Kivu’s highlands , with fighting involving several 
armed groups, some backed by neighboring countries.  
On February 22, armed assailants ambushed a World Food Programme (WFP) 
convoy on the road north of Goma, killing one Congolese driver and the Italian ambassador to Congo as well as his bodyguard. In June, UN experts 
said  they 
could not establish the identity of the attackers, and that national and interna-tional investigations were ongoing. 
In July, the Tshisekedi administration launched a new Disarmament, Demobiliza-
tion, Community Recovery, and Stabilization program. However, many Congolese activists publicly 
raised  concerns  over the appointment of the program’s coordi-
nator, Tommy Tambwe , a former leader of major Rw andan-backed rebel groups 
that have been responsible for countless abuses over the past 25 years.  
199HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHJustice and Accountability 
In January, French authorities arrested  former Congolese rebel leader Roger Lum-
bala on charges of participating in a gr oup formed to plan crimes against hu-
manity and complicity in crimes against humanity. The investigation focuses on 
abuses featured in the 2010 UN Mapping Report , which documented the most 
serious crimes committed acro ss Congo between 1993 and 2003. 
In February, at least 67 Indigenous people, ethnic Iyeke, were killed and more 
than 1,200 houses burned by ethnic Nkundo villagers, across a dozen villages 
sitting on the edge of the Salonga National Park in the western Tshuapa province. Although four suspects were arrested, the investigation into the killings made no progress. 
In March, the International Criminal Court’s appeals chamber 
confirmed  the con-
viction and sentence of Bosco Ntaganda , a former rebel leader and subsequently 
general in the Congolese army, to 30 years in prison on 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
Starting in May, civilians in North Kivu and Ituri, both under martial law, were 
prosecuted for criminal off enses before military courts, c ontrary to principles of 
the African C ommiss ion on Human and Peoples’ Rights. 
In August, the Tshisekedi admini stration estab lished a commiss ion tasked with 
delivering a roadmap f or transition al justice, but it  has yet to fully  commit to end-
ing impunity for serious crime s. Military courts and other tribunals adjudicating 
cases of war crimes and crimes agains t humanity have made little progress in 
filling the wide accountability gap in the country. These cases continue to high-light severe shortcomings in the domestic justice system.  
The 
trial,  which opened in 2017 , continued for the murders of United Nations in-
vestigators Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalán, and the disappearance of their 
three Congolese moto drivers and their interpreter. In September 2021, human 
rights organizations and foreign diplomats denounced the arrest  of Congolese 
journalist Sos thène Kambidi, who was int errogated over the origin of  a video 
showing the killing of the two inv estigators. Kamb idi was granted c onditional re-
lease on October 12. 
200WORLD REPORT 2022The trial for the December 2018 Yumbi killings  in the country’s west, in which at 
least 535 people were killed, started  before a military court in May 2021 but little 
progress was m ade.  
Following revelations  by international media, authorities made several arrests 
linked to the 2010 murder of prominent human rights defender  Floribert 
Chebeya  and his driver Fidèle Bazana. A new trial began in September 2021 for 
defendants Christian Kenga Kenga and  Jacques Mugabo, both senior police offi-
cers. Meanwhile, Gen. John Numb i, who was also implicated in the double mur-
der, reportedly fled Congo and  was officially declared  a deserter in June. 
Congolese authorities made no app arent progress investigating and providing 
adequate medical or psychological support to victims of the September 2020 prison riot at 
Kasapa Central Prison  in Lubumbashi. During three days of vio-
lence, inmates repeatedly raped sev eral dozen female detainees, including a 
teenage girl. 
Gédéon Kyungu , a notorious warlord responsible for atrocities in the southern 
region of Katanga who escaped from house arrest in Lubumbashi in March 2020 remained at large at time of writing. 
Militia leader Guidon Shimir ay Mwissa, wanted by Congolese authorities since 
2019 for serious crimes, including rape and child soldier recruitment, remained 
active in North Kivu, commanding a faction of the Nduma Defense of Congo-Rénové (NDC-R). The Congole se army used a separate faction of the NDC-R, led 
by Gilbert Bwira, as a proxy to fight other armed groups, 
UN experts said in June . 
Bwira was eventually arrested  in October. 
Environment and Climate Change 
Congo contains the world’s second largest rainforest. Scientists estimate that the forest’s soil alone holds billions of tons of carbon, as much as 20 years’ 
worth of the fossil f uel emissions of the United St ates. If rel eased through in-
creased deforestation or other disturbances it could have catastrophic effects on efforts to contain climate change.  
Successive  governments continued to grant  multiple logging contracts, despite 
imposing a mor atorium on new logging conc essions in 2002. In Februar y, civil 
201HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHsociety organizations filed a lawsuit  against the former envi ronment minister for 
reportedly breaching the prohibition by granting logging concessions to Chinese 
companies in 2020.  
In July, the Tshisekedi administration set out  a plan that includes ending the 
moratorium on logging, but an agreement reached at the COP26 conditions lift-ing the moratorium on the planning of forest allocations based on a consultative process. 
In April, President Tshisekedi 
pledged  to restore forest cov er to 63 percent by 
2030 at a climate summit hosted by the US. 
During the same month, a bill that would recognize Indigenous peoples’ rights 
over their tradition al territorie s was adopte d in the National Assembly but it had 
yet to be voted by the Senate before it  could be passed into law. Ending the 
moratorium on logging without a domestic leg al framework that protects Indige-
nous rights could undermine communities’ access to their forests, as they would have little recourse against businesses that claimed them.  
Key International Actors 
In January 2021, the UN Human Rights C ommittee, which monitors state compli-
ance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, found  that 
Congo violated the right to life of human rights defender Pascal Kabungulu, who was killed in an extrajudicial exec ution, in front of his f amily in 2005. 
An independent comm ission, prompted by repor ting of inves tigative jour nalists, 
found  in September that more than 80 aid  workers, including some employed by 
the World Health Organization, were involved  in sexual abuse and exploitation of 
dozens of women during an Ebola outbreak in Congo between 2018 and 2020. 
In October, the UN Human Rights Council decided to renew the mandate of the 
Team of International Experts on the situation in the Kasai and to extend its man-date to cover the entire country.   
202WORLD REPORT 2022Ecuador 
In May, President Guillermo Lasso took office. The 137 lawmakers of the National 
Assembly, where Lasso la cks a majority, started their fo ur-year t erm in May, and 
elected the assembly’s first Indigenous president. One of Lasso’s first actions was to intr oduce a new bi ll aimed at  undoing the severe dam age to free speech 
caused by former President Rafael Correa during his decade in power. 
Corruption, inefficiency, and political interference have plagued Ecuador’s judici-
ary for years. Reforms under former Pres ident Lenín Moreno to repair the Correa 
administration’s damage to democratic institutions improved the independence of key institutions but reports of trial delays and allegations of improper pres-sure on courts and lack of due pr ocess in high-profile corruption cases contin-
ued. 
Poor prison conditions and violence, secu rity agencies’ indiscriminate use of 
force, restrictions on women’s and girls’ acce ss to reproductive health care, and 
limited protection of chi ldren’s and refugee rights remained serious concerns.  
Several allegations of corruption marred the Covid-19 pandemic response.  
Judicial Independence  
Under President Mor eno, a trans itional Coun cil of Citizen Pa rticipation was ap-
pointed to repair the Correa administr ation’s damage to key institutions by dis-
missing authorities after evaluating their performance, and appointing new members to the Judiciary Council, Constit utional Court, and Prosecutor’s Office, 
among other institutions. 
In August 2020, Ecuador’s Constitutional Court significantly limited the Judiciary 
Council’s powers to interfere in judges’ work. 
However, during 2021, allegations persisted of unjustified delays during trials, 
government officials improperly pressuring courts, and lack of due process in high-profile corruption cases. 
203HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUse of Force by Security Forces 
On May 6, the Constitutional Court nullified a May 2020 Defense Ministry resolu-
tion giving the military broad powers to participate in security operations at demonstrations and meetings, and to use lethal force. Security forces had used excessive fo rce against demons trators in October 2019. The ro le of the armed 
forces in law enforcement must be exceptional, temporary, limited to what is strictly necessary, and complementary to that of law enforcement agents, the court held. 
The Constitutional Court instructed the National Assembly to consider its rele-
vant findings—and international standa rds—during debate of a bill, pending at 
time of writing, to regulate use of  force by security agencies. 
In August, the Ombudsper son’s Office found that police officers used  excessive 
force in the rural town of La Merced de Buenos Aires when they dispersed resi-
dents who were blocking a road and pr otesting a government mining concession 
to an Australian mining company.  
In March, a truth commission created by the Ombudsperson’s  Office to investi-
gate excessive  use of force du ring 2019 demonstr ations attributed the deaths  of 
six protesters to security forces. It attributed around 75 percent of human rights violations during the protests to police and 13 percent to the military.  
Prison Conditions 
Overcrowding and other poor conditions, violence, and inadequate health care are longstanding problems in prisons.  
Over 600 detainees contracted Covid-19 in 20 20 and fell ill in overcrowded cell-
blocks. Several reportedly died. 
In September, a prison uprising in Guayaquil city left over 118 detainees dead 
and 52 injured. For the second time since taking office, President Lasso decreed a state of emergency in prisons, this one for 90 days. 
Two other uprisings, in February and July, left over a hundred detainees dead 
and injured dozens of detainees and security officers, including a female officer 
who was raped. 
204WORLD REPORT 2022In all three uprisings, police officers and  soldiers intervened against armed crim-
inal groups inside the facilities. 
Women’s Rights  
On April 28, the Constitutional Court ruled abortion decriminalized in all cases in which the pregnancy results from rape. To  comply, the Ombudsperson’s Office 
introduced a bill on June 28 to guarantee access to abortion for victims of rape; six months are allowed for legislative debate at the National Assembly.  
Until April, women and girls could seek an abortion only when they had a “men-
tal disability” and had been raped or when the pregnancy endangered their health or life.  
Stigmatization, mistreatment by health profess ionals, fear of criminal prosecu-
tion, and a narrow interpretation of the health exception remain barriers to abor-tion access. Low-income women appear more likely to be prosecuted. 
The Attorney General’s Office reported 49 femicides–defined as murders of 
women based on their gender–between January and September. Bu t civil society 
organizations reported over 100 cases of killings of women in just the first six months of 2021. 
Children’s Rights  
Sexual violence is a longstanding, per vasive problem in pub lic and private 
schools. Between January 2014 and February 2021, Ecuador’s Education Ministry registered 3,777 complaints of school-rel ated sexual violence by teachers, ad-
ministrative staff, and other students, including online.  
On August 14, Ecuador commemorated its first national day against sexual vio-
lence in schools, complying with a 2020 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling in the Paola Guzman Albarr acín case. Paola, who was 14 when her vice 
principal raped and abused her, took her own life in 2002. At time of writing, Ecuador had not complied fully with measures ordered by the court, including publishing data on school-related se xual violence, and training education staff 
on how to treat and prevent  situations of  sexual violence and assist v ictims of 
school-related sexual vi olence and their families.

The Impact of Abortion Prosecutions in EcuadorHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  In March, the National Assembly changed Ecuador’s education law, adding 
mechanisms against violence in schools  and guaranteeing free access to infor-
mation about sexuality and sexual and reproductive rights. 
The government’s pandemic response included  nationwide school closures, 
starting in April 2020. Ecuador ranked 1 3th, worldwide in total days of school 
closures, UNICEF reported, with 169 as of February 2021. Almost 4.5 million stu-dents have mis sed at least three-quarters of a year of clas sroom inst ruction. Du r-
ing the pandemic, only 4 out of 10 househo lds with children under 5 have had 
access to early childhood development services, including pre-primary educa-tion. 
Disability Rights 
A substitute decision-making model for peop le with disabilities still prevails, 
failing to recognize their fu ll legal capacity  in all areas of life, including the right 
to informed consent to health treatment.  
On March 26, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that Ecuador failed 
to properly inform Luis Eduardo Guachalá Chimbo, a 23 -year-old with an intellec-
tual disability, and his mother, about his treatment at a public psychiatric hospi-tal and did not adopt all measures to obtain his full consent. Guachalá disappeared from the hospital in 2004, and Ecuador did not fulfill its obligation to search for him, the court ruled. He has never been found. 
Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Sex Characteristics 
In June 2019, the Constitutional Court ru led in favor of same-sex marriage, de-
claring the country’s marriage legislation unconstitutional.  
The National As sembly has not yet comp lied with Cons titutional Cour t rulings to 
revise legal provis ions on civil m arriage to include same-sex couples, reform the 
legal gender recognition procedure for transgender people to be based on self-determination, regulate  assisted r eproduction methods, and  allow f or same-sex 
couples to register their ch ildren with their surnames. 
On June 28, the Secretary for Human Rights created a subsecretary office for di-
versity, charged with developing policies to prevent violence against lesbian, 
207HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHgay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. The office will not have its own 
budget. 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples  
Indigenous peoples are entitled, in the constitution, to communal possession of 
ancestral lands and consultation regarding resources and projects on them. These rights are not fully protected, human rights organizations and community 
leaders report.  
Several communities have filed comp laints seeking protection for their ancestral 
lands. In one case, the National Court will decide whether to uphold a lower court’s order to evict  loggers and farmer s trespassing on the Siekopai Indige-
nous people’s territory in the Amazonian prov ince of Sucumbíos. Trespassers oc-
cupy half of the territory and have cleared a quarter of the forests, community 
leaders said. 
In August, the Constitutional Court ruled  against pretrial  detention of members 
of uncontacted Indigenous tribes; it also ruled that pretrial detention of mem-
bers of recently contacted tribes could not be ordered without first engaging in appropriate inter -cultural di alogue, including about alternatives to detention. 
Indigenous people were impacted by Covid-19. On June 18, 2020, Waorani In-
digenous communities successfully sued  the government for its inaction. The 
judge ordered the Ministry of Health to send medical personnel and equipment to respond to an outbreak. In July this year, 126 Waoranis were vaccinated. 
Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Migrants  
Ecuador has passed  some of the most progre ssive laws in the region protecting 
migrants and  refugees. As of  September, Ecuador was shelt ering 451,093 
Venezuelan migrants and refugees. As of August, 1,151 people from all countries 
were recognized as refugees in 2021. 
Although Ecuador promises free health care regardless of migratory status, 
Venezuelans experience limitations. 
Venezuelans have various options for obtaining a visa, but with elevated costs 
and long processes, slowed by Covid-19. On June 17 , President Lasso announced a regularization process that coul d benefit around 450,000 Venezuelans. 
208WORLD REPORT 2022Right to Privacy  
On May 10, the National Assembly adopted a data protection law, introduced 
under former President Moreno after a major breach of citizens’ personal data. 
The law protects, under certain circumstance s, citizens’ rights to access, correct, 
and erase incorrect data about them stored in databases  
Freedom of Expression  
Soon after taking office, President Lasso introduced a bill to replace the Commu-nications Law that former President Corr ea wielded to undermine free speech. 
In 2018, legislators eliminated the agency known as SUPERCOM, which the Cor-
rea adminis tration had used to harass and pu nish media. In 20 20, they re-
scinded a prob lematic provis ion identifying commu nication as a public service.  
On May 6, the lame duck National Assembly approved a Law to Prevent Violence, 
Digital Ha rass ment, and Violation of Privacy. Though intended to address online 
gender-based violence, it threatened to sev erely restrict the ability of journalists 
and others to document and expose misconduct and human rights violations. President Lasso ve toed some prob lematic provis ions on c riminal def amation 
and disclosure of secrecy. However, legislators retained an overly broad defini-tion of criminal defamation, which can be committed “through any of the infor-
mation and communication technologies.” 
Accountability for Past Abuses  
In 2010, a truth comm ission to inv estigate gov ernment abuses from 1984 to 
2008 documented gross human rights vi olations against 456 people. Final rul-
ings have been rendered in only two prosecutions. Others appear to be stalled. 
Covid-19 and Corruption  
The pandemic hit Ecuador hard, with 513,026 reported cases and 32,899 deaths 
as of October. In June 2020, amid allegations that corpses of people who died after getting Covid-19 had disappeared , a judge ordered authorities to identify 
them in hospital and police morgues in Gua yaquil City. At time of writing, dozens 
of families were still loo king for relatives’ bodies. 
209HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHDespite some improvements, the transparency of the government’s spending in 
response to the pandemic has gaps, par ticularly related to  beneficial ownership 
and publication of emergency procurement contracts. The Attorney General’s Of-fice has inves tigated al legations of  corruption related to Covid-19 su ch as em-
bezzlement and overpriced purchases of medical supplies.  
President Lasso’s administration accelerated roll-out of vaccines, bringing the 
percentage of people fully vaccinated to over 57 , as of October. 
Key International Actors and Foreign Policy  
On June 14, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on allega-tions of human rights violations in the 2011 convictions of journalist Emilio Pala-cios and three members of the board of  the newspaper El Universo for criminal 
defamation in an opinion piece criticizing then-President Correa. At time of writ-ing, a de cision was pending. 
On July 13, the National Assembly ratified the Inter-American Convention Against 
All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance, which disallows discrimination re-garding gender expression, migratory circu mstances, and genetic characteris-
tics. 
In August, the office of the United Nations  High Comm issioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) released a survey showing that 82 percent of migrants and refugees in Ecuador would face significant risks if returned to their country of origin. Since a humanitarian visa program ended, UNHCR noted, regu larization has bec ome 
“difficult” in Ecuador for the Venezuelan population.  
During the UN General Assembly in September, President Lasso expressed con-
cern for fleeing Venez uelans. H is administration has c riticized  the human rights 
situation in Venezuela and Nicaragua. 
Ecuador joined 70 other countries in highlighting the need for a safe exit for flee-
ing Afghans. The 5,000 Afghans whom Ecuador volu nteered to receive temporar-
ily appear to have been relocated to other countries by the United States instead. 
210WORLD REPORT 2022Egypt 
 
In 2021, authoritie s escalated the use of the a busive Emergency Stat e Security 
Courts to prosecute peac eful activis ts and critics who joined thousand s of dissi-
dents already in Egypt’s congested prisons. Courts issued death sentences in mass trial s, adding to the sharply escal ating numbers of  executions.  
The government in January issued implementing regulations for the 2019 NGO 
law that codified draconian restrictions on independent organizations. The au-thorities failed to appropriat ely investigate a high-profi le gang-rape, and key wit-
nesses remain under extrajudicial travel bans after being jailed for months in 
apparent retaliation f or coming forward.  
The army continued to impose severe rest rictions on movement and demolish 
hundreds of buildings in North Sinai in the name of fighting Wilayat Sina’ , a local 
affiliate of the Islamic  State (also known as IS IS). These demolitions likely 
amount to war crimes.  
Egypt’s prolonged  human rights cr isis u nder President A bdel Fatt ah al-Sisi’s gov-
ernment was subject to rare  international  criticis m at the United  Nations Human 
Rights Council.  
Police and Security Forces Abuses  
In 2021, Interior Ministry police and National  Security agents arbitrarily arrested 
dozens, likely hundreds , for peaceful activism, forcibly disappearing many for 
days or weeks. National Security officers also routinely required  newly released 
activis ts to report to their offic es regularly, in addition to other forms  of extraju-
dicial coercion and summons. On February 1, police arrested Ahmed Samir 
Santawy , a Central European University student, and held him incommunicado 
for five days during which, his lawy er said, he was severely beaten.  
Authorities failed to investig ate incidents of torture and mistreatment, which re-
main widespread. On April 18, security forces arrested the mother, father, and sister of jailed dissident 
Abdelrahman Gamal Metwally al-Showeikh  after his 
family filed a complaint about al-Showeik h’s alleged torture and sexual assault

Security forc es intimidat ed and haras sed families  of dissidents  who live abroad. 
On February 13, authorities raided the homes of six members of the extended family of Mohamed Soltan, a US-ba sed human rights adv ocate. They arrested 
two of his cousins and another relative at their homes. They were released five days later. Soltan’s father, Salah, jailed since 2013 in several cases for opposing 
the military removal of  former President Mohamed Mor sy, has been held in in-
communicado detention since June 2020 in reprisal for Mohamed Soltan’s 
human rights advocacy in Washington.   
The National Security Agency in recent years ki lled dozens of alleged “terrorists” 
across the country in extrajudicial executions the authorities contended were “shootouts.” A Human Rights Watch repor t released in September 2021 
found  
that the alleged armed militants killed posed no imminent danger to security forces or others when they were killed, and in many cases had already been in custody.  
The army continued to impose severe rest rictions on freedom of movement in 
North Sinai, where the military have for years been battling the armed group 
Wilayat Sina’ , an ISIS affiliate. Despite an appar ent decrease in violent attacks 
by armed militants, the army demolished hundreds of homes and razed 
most of 
the farmland  in the governorate. The government failed to compensate thou-
sands whose houses and l ivelihoods were destroyed in the name of creating 
buffer zones. The massive demolitions, including over 12,300 bu ildings, likely 
amount to war crimes, absent in many cases evidence of an “absolute” military 
necessity.  
President al-Sisi issued a decree on October 2 transferring unchecked powers to 
the Defense Ministry in North Sinai, including the power to evict residents from any areas, impose curfews, and b an transportation or communication. The six-
month decree can be renewed indefinitely  as long as the government claims a 
continuing “terrorist” threat. 
213HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPrison Conditions and Deaths in Custody  
The dire conditions in Egyptian prisons and  detention centers remained shielded 
from independent oversight. Authorities routinely deprived  sick prisoners from 
access to adequate health care. According to the Committee for Justice, an inde-
pendent organization, 57 prisoners, most of them jailed on political grounds, 
died in custody in the first eight months of 2021.  
On July 25, the family of 69-year-old Ab d al-Moniem Abu al-Fotouh, the former 
presidential candidate and leader of the Strong Egypt Party, said  he had suffered 
symptoms resembling a heart attack whi le in prolonged solitary confinement in 
Cairo’s Tora Prison. Abu al-Fotouh, unjustly detained without trial since 2018, had suffered several heart attacks in detention, his family said, but prison au-thorities 
rejected their pleas  to have him admitted to a hospital. 
Prominent act ivist Alaa A bdel Fatt ah has been in solitary confinement without 
trial in Tora’s maximum-security prison since September 2019. His family said a National Secu rity Agency officer has been depriving prisoners of  visits, exercise, 
sunlight, and books and newspapers. In Oc tober, authorities referred Abdel Fat-
tah along with human rights lawyer Mohamed al-Baqr to trial in another case on charges of “spreading fal se news” before an Emergency St ate Security Court.  
On September 15, President al-Sisi said that the government would soon inaugu-
rate Egypt’s largest prison complex, which he described as built according to an 
“American model.” We Record, an independent group, reported in October that the new complex, northwest of Cairo, wi ll have a capacity exceeding 30,000 pris-
oners. 
Fair Trials, Due Proc ess, Death Penalty  
In 2021, Egypt continued to escalate its use of the death penalty and executions, 
in many cases follo wing unfair proceeding s and mass trial s. The Egyptian Front 
for Human Rights said that in the first six months of 2021, the authorities exe-cuted 80 people, roughly half in cases of alleged political violence. Amnesty In-
ternational said that Egypt ranked third worst in numbers of executions worldwide. On June 14, the Court of Cassation, Egypt’s highest appellate court, upheld death sentences for 12 Muslim Brotherhood leaders, members, and sym-
pathizers as well as long prison sentences f or hundreds of others convicted in a 
214WORLD REPORT 2022mass unf air trial of over 7 00 diss idents, including 22 children, charged with in-
volvement in the 2013 Rab’a sit-in that opposed the military ouster of President Mohamed Morsy.  
Authorities inc reasingly employed the extraordinary Emergency  State Security 
Courts, the de cisions of which are not subject  to appeal, to prosecut e dissi-
dents. Former President Hosni Mubarak’s government had abolished them in 2007 but al-Sisi’s government reinstated them in 2017.  
According to lawyers and detainees’ f amilies, judges and p rosecutors routinely 
remanded thousands of detainees in cust ody without presenting evidence, often 
in brief hearings that did not allow them to present a defense. Even when courts ordered detainees released , Supreme State Security prosecutors routinely added 
them to new cases with the same charges to detain them beyond the two-year 
limit on pretrial detention in Egyptian law. 
Freedom of Association and Attacks on Human Rights 
Defenders  
In January 2021, the government issued implementing regulations  for the 2019 
NGO Law, confirming its restrictive nature  and exten sive gov ernment interfer-
ence. Existing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) must register under the new law by January 2022 or face being dissolved.  
Under international and domestic pres sure, authorities dropped investigations 
against several critical organizations and defenders in the decade-old Case 173 
of 2011 in which dozens of NGOs were p rosecuted for rece iving foreign funds. 
However, punitive travel bans and asset freezes have not been lifted despite the judge’s orders in 
August  and September  to do so. Several other organizations 
and staff members remain accused in the case, including Gamal Eid , director of 
the Arab Network for Human Rights Inform ation, and Hossam Bahgat, director of 
the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights . 
In September, authorities referred to trial  before an Emergency State Security 
Court Patrick Zaki, a gender-rights researc her at the Egyptian Initiative for Per-
sonal Rights, on charges of “spreading fal se news.” Authorities had detained  
him since February 2020 and officers allegedly tortured him in custody.  
215HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAlso in September, a mass trial beg an before an Emer gency State Sec urity Court 
that included lawyer Ezzat Ghoniem , director of the Egyptian Coordination for 
Rights and Freedoms , and about tw o dozen act ivists that  authorities lin ked to 
the group, including la wyer Hoda Abdel  Moniem and act ivist Aisha al- Shater. Se-
curity forces have detained Ghoniem since March 2018. They face criminal charges of j oining and financ ing an unlawful group as we ll as “spre ading false 
news.” 
The trials of Zaki, Ghoniem and the others began the same week that President 
al-Sisi announced the government’s 
“national strategy ” for human rights and 
claimed  that 20 22 would be the “ye ar of civi l society.” 
Freedom of Expression  
The authorities released several detained journalists such as Khaled Dawood  
and Esraa Abdel Fattah , but detained others. On February 22, National Security 
officers at Cairo Airport arrested columnist and journalist Gamal al-Gamal, 
known for his critical views,  and held him incommunicado for five days upon his 
return from Turkey. Authorities released him  without trial in July.  
In May, authorities arrested  veteran journalist Tawfiq Ghanim on terrorism 
charges. He remained in pretrial detention at time of writing. In July, authorities 
arrested Abdel Nasser Salama , a former chief editor of the government-owned 
al-Ahram  newspaper following an article he posted on his Facebook page  criti-
cizing President al-Sisi and calling on him to step down. 
Freedom of Belief  
Authorities detained  independent act ivists w orking on societ al and governmen-
tal discrimination against Egypt’s Christian minority, such as Ramy Kamal , the 
head of Ma spero Youth for Hum an Rights. He has been held w ithout trial since 
November 2019, accused of joining and financing a “terrorist group.” 
The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights said in October  that since 2016 the au-
thorities have approved legalization of only 1,958 churches and service build-ings among more than 5,540 Christian worship buildings that lack proper legal 
216WORLD REPORT 2022status. The government also issued no licenses to build new churches except in 
new desert cities that are subj ect to different rules. 
Women’s Rights, Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation  
In 2021, courts sentenced at least four women social media influencers to two 
and five years in prison for morality-relat ed offences for their online videos and 
posts. 
On May 11, Prosecutor General Hamada al-Sawy said his office had terminated  
investigations into the high-profile 2014 “Fairmont” gang -rape case for “insuffi-
cient evidence” and ordered the release of the four accused men. This came after the main witnes ses, who came forward to su pport the rape su rvivor in 
2020, had been unlawfully arreste d and two of them spent months in arb itrary 
detention. At time of writing, all five key witn esses remain arbitrarily banned 
from travel abroad despite closure of the case.  
On September 25, a criminal co urt in al-Qaliubya governorate 
sentenced  a father 
and a nurse to three and ten years respect ively in prison for carrying out female 
genital mutilation (FGM) of a young girl that led to long-term disability. In March, the Egyptian parliament amended the pen al code to impose tougher penalties 
for medical professionals and others who perform FGM. Earlier increases in sen-
tences have done little to stem the practice of FGM, which remains rampant. 
In March, women launched the socia l media #GuardianshipIsM yRight campaign 
to oppose amendments to the Personal Stat us Law, proposed by the govern-
ment, which would have added to deep ly entrenched discrimination against 
women.  
Social, Economic, and Health Rights  
Authorities used  abusive  terrorism l aws to crack down on businesses  and work-
ers. In late September, National Security  agents arrested three workers from an 
electrical appliances factory in western Cairo for participating in a sit-in. 
Supreme State Security prosec utors released them a week  later after filing terror-
ism-related charges against them, the independent Center for Trade Union and 
Workers Services reported . The authorities arrested  well-known businessman 
217HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSafwan Thabet in December 2020 and his son, Seif Thabet, in February 2021 and 
kept them in pretrial detention in conditions  amounting to torture on terrorism-
related charges. Their arrest came after they  refused security officials’ requests 
to relinquish control of their company’s assets, the family said .  
The government’s pl an for Covid-19 vacc ine rollout that beg an in March  has been 
inefficient and vague. By mid-October, roughly 15 per cent of the population  re-
ceived  one dose of the vaccine despite the government claim that it had millions  
of additional doses. A study  cited by  a World Bank report, published in August, 
found that Egyptian authorities underreported Covid-19 related deaths by tens of thousands. 
Most children in Egypt experience 
corporal punishment  at home or at school. 
Egypt promised to ban corporal punishment in all settings during its UN Univer-sal Periodic Review in 2019 but did not revise the penal code or other laws that exempt the practice from penalty. 
Key International Actors  
In 2021, two major factors worried the Egyptian government: the change of ad-
ministrations in the United States, and a long overdue joint condemnation  of 
Egypt’s record by 32 states at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March. 
Despite US President Joe Biden promising that he would give President al-Sisi 
“no more blank checks,” in September his administration released $170 million 
out of $300 million in military financing that the US Congress had suspended pending human rights improvements. The remaining $130 million will be re-leased pending progress on nontransparent conditions set by the administra-tion.  
European Union member states continued to cite Egypt in their Joint Item 4 state-
ment at the UN H uman Rights Council, but weapon sales, milit ary assist ance and 
political support continued to be the rule at the bilateral level for many of those 
states. The negotiation of  EU-Egypt part nership priorities has been stalled  due to 
Egypt’s resistance to  linking assistanc e to human rights conditions.  
French President Emmanuel Macron 
said  in December 2020 that his government 
would not condition weapon sales to Egypt on human rights improvements. In 
218WORLD REPORT 2022May, the French government announced  a €3.75 billion (US$4.5 billion) sale of 
30 Rafale fighter jets to Egypt, financed through French loans  that add to Egypt’s 
external debt burden.  
In October, an Italian court suspended  the trial in absentia for four Egyptian po-
lice and National Security Agency officers ch arged by Italian pro secutors with the 
abduction and tor ture of Guilio Regeni, an Italian researcher who was mur dered 
in Egypt in 2016, because of Egyptian authoritie s’ persistent lack of cooperation.   
219HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHEl Salvador 
In 2021, President Nayib Bukele and his allies in the legislature undermined 
basic democratic checks and  balances, inc luding by summarily dismissing and 
replacing Supreme Court judges they disagreed  with and p assing laws to  dismiss 
hundreds of lower-level judges and prosecutors.  
In September, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court allowed Presi-
dent Bukele to run for re-election, despite a constitutional prohibition on imme-diate re-election.  
President Bukele’s  government has indicated he plans  to introduce a proposal to 
reform the constitution, including by extending the presidential term from five to 
six years and overhauling some democratic institutions.  
Gangs continue to exerci se territorial control over some neighborhoods and ex-
tort residents throughout the country. They forcibly recruit children and sexually abuse women, girls, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. 
Gangs kill, disappear, rape, or displace those who resist.  
Historically, security forces have committed extrajudicial executions, sexual as-
saults, enforced disappearances, and torture.  
From 2011 to October 2020, 71,500 people were internally displaced, mostly due 
to violence perpetuated by gangs and secu rity forces, according to the Office of 
the United Nations  High Comm issioner for Refugees.  
Girls and women accused of having abortions have been imprisoned for homi-
cide and aggravated homicide. LGBT individuals face discrimination and police violence.  
Judicial Independence 
During the campaign for the February 2021 parliamentary elections, President Bukele repeatedly accused members of the Supreme Electoral Court of organiz-
ing a “fraud,” with no evidence. 
President Bukele’s party won the elections, obtaining a two-thirds majority. On 
May 1, the day his supporters were seated in the National Assembly, they sum-
220WORLD REPORT 2022marily removed and replaced all five  judges of the Supreme Court’s Constitu-
tional Chamber, as well as the attorney general.  
In late June, the Legislative Assembly appointed five new judges to the Supreme 
Court, in violation of the process established in the constitution. The Assembly had appointed 10 of a total 15 Supreme Court judges by September, although Salvadorean law only allows each newly constituted legislature to appoint five.  
On August 31, lawmakers pas sed two laws  dismissing a ll judge s and prosecutors 
over 60 years of age or with 30 or more years of service, allowing the Supreme Court and the attorney general to grant exceptions extending their terms “due to reasons of necessity or specialty .” The law affects one-third of all judges. 
Abuses by Security Forces 
President Bukele continued using the military in public security operations, al-
though the 1992 peace accord bars  it. In February 2020 , President Bukele en-
tered the Legislative Assembly with armed soldiers in an app arent effort to 
intimidate legislators into approving a lo an for the security forces. Between 
March and May 2020, the police arbitrari ly detained individuals accused of vio-
lating Covid-19 measures.  
In November 2020, during an investigation int o allegedly irregular purchases re-
lated to Covid-19, police blocked prosec utors from executing a court order to raid 
the offices of the Health Ministry.  
Between 2015 and 2020, the police committed 179 extrajudicial killings, the Om-
budsperson’s Office reported. Twenty-five resulted in convictions.  
Education 
Between March 2020 and April 2021, the gov ernment closed schools to prevent 
the spread of Covid-19. Approximately 1.4 million students missed “almost all classroom instruction” between March 2020 and February 2021, according to 
UNICEF. The government implemented a range of distance learning initiatives, in-cluding online c lasse s.  
221HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPrison and Police Barracks  
Prisons held over 36,600 detainees in March, twice the official capacity, the 
World Prison Brief revealed. Approximately 23 percent of inmates were in pretrial 
detention.  
Overcrowding and poor sanitation endanger ed the health of prisoners and 
risked accelerating the spread of Covid-19.  
Gangs and Violence 
Approximately 60,000 gang members operat e in El Salvador, media report. They 
exert control over parts of the territory and commit serious abuses, including killings and rape. 
According to media reports, nu merous security and elected officials have collab-
orated with gangs in criminal operations, and many political parties have negoti-ated with the groups, including in exch ange for gang members’ support during 
elections.  
In August 2021, the digital outlet El Faro reported that Attorney General Raúl 
Melara had been investigating al leged negotiations between the government 
and the country’s three largest gangs prior to his removal on May 1. According to the article, the government had offered ja il privileges to imprisoned gang mem-
bers and increased employment opportu nities for members outside of prison in 
exchange for the gang’s commitment to lower homicide rates.  
The National Police reported 1,322 homicides from January to December 2020, 
compared to more than 2,398 during the same period in 2019, a 46 percent drop. Homicide data for 2021 had not been published at time of writing. 
Disappearances 
From January 2014 to November 2020, authorities reported more than 13,000 
disappearance victims (including more th an 400 children)—which exceeds the 
estimated 8 ,000 to 10,000 dis appeared du ring the civil war (1979-1992). Disap-
pearances are committed by a range of  actors, including gang s and the police. 
Few cases are investigated. 
222WORLD REPORT 2022Government Accountability 
Impunity for government abuses is the norm.  
A trial of former military commanders accused in the 1 981 El Mozote  massacre 
started in 2016 and continued  at time of writing. Soldiers committ ed mass rape 
and killed 978 civi lians at El  Mozote, including 553 ch ildren. In Sept ember 20 20, 
soldiers—with President Bukele’s backing—refu sed to comply with a court order 
that allowed a judge to review military reco rds about the massacre. In Septem-
ber 2021, Jorge Guzm án, the judge investig ating the massacre, was ousted be-
cause he was over 60 years of age. His removal is likely to cau se further del ays in 
the trial.  
Between March and June 2020, the Access to Public Information Agency, 
charged with implementing the Access to Pu blic Information Law, suspended all 
hearings and proces ses, invoking the Co vid-19 st ate of emergency . The de cision 
undermined access to information of public interest. In May, legislators granted government officials and contractor s “immunity” from criminal and administra-
tive charges related to Covid-19 policies, including acquisition of medical sup-
plies and services. In October, the Assembl y reformed the law to “clarify” that 
the “immunity” would not cover “corruption,” “bribing,” or any “similar crimes.” At the time of h is removal also in May , Attorney Gener al Melara was investigating 
six government officials, including the health minister, for alleged corruption and improper emergency purchases related to Covid-19.  
In June, the Attorney General’s Office ended a cooperation agreement with the 
International  Commission Against Impunity in El Salvador (CICIE S), a body 
backed by the Organization of American States (OAS) to fight corruption. CICIES had been investigating alleged irregularities in emergency purchases related to 
Covid-19. 
Former President  Mauricio Funes (2009-2014), who has been living in Nicaragua 
since 2016, faces criminal charges including corruption, embezzlement, and money laundering. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega granted Funes Nicaraguan citizenship in July 2021. 
223HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen’s Sexual and Reproductive Rights 
Abortion is illegal under all circumstances. Women face two to eight years in 
prison for having an abortion. Providers face prison sentences of 6 months to 12 years. 
In September, President Bukele said that  the government-backed constitutional 
reform would not help ease the country’s prohibition on abortion.  
Many women, including women who suffered miscarriages or obstetric emergen-
cies, have been sentenced to up to 40 years in prison on charges of violating the 
law. As of June 2021, 17 women who said they had suffered obstetric emergen-cies remained imprisoned on charges of abortion, homicide, or aggravated homicide. suffered obstetric emergencies remained imprisoned on charges of abortion, homicide, or aggravated homicide.  
Disability Rights 
El Salvador’s legislative framework remains inconsistent with international dis-ability rights law, with restrictions on legal capacity for people with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, as well as insufficient measures to improve physi-cal and communication accessibility. Criminal gangs have attacked women and girls with disabilities, with high levels of impunity. 
LGBT Rights 
LGBT people remain targets of homophobic and transphobic violence by police, 
gangs, and the general public. In many  cases, LGBT people flee persecution at 
home, including to the United States. Salvadorean authorities, which in 2017 ac-
knowledged anti-LGBT violence committed by public security officials, reported 
692 cases of violence against LGBT  and intersex peop le from January 2015 to 
June 2019. 
El Salvador does not  have comprehen sive civil non-discrimin ation legislation 
that covers discrimin ation on the b asis of sex ual orientation and  gender identity, 
nor a legal gender recognition procedure for transgender people. In September, President Bukele said that the government-backed constitutional reform would not legally recognize same-sex relationships. 
224WORLD REPORT 2022Attacks on Journalists  
The Association of Journalists of El Salvador (APES) reported 173 press freedom 
violations between January and August 2 021, including att acks, digital  harass-
ment, and restrictions on journalists’ work and access to public information. 
In September 2020, a few weeks after El Faro  reported that President Bukele had 
negotiated with MS-13, the president announced criminal investigations accus-ing the newspaper of “money la undering” and “t ax e vasion.” El Faro  has also 
been subject to tax audits that  appear select ive and abusive. 
Since taking office, Pres ident Bukele has u ndermined the credibi lity of inde-
pendent media outlets, accusing them of spreading “fake news” or serving polit-ical interests. In June, the security mini ster said authorities “were following” 
journalists he had accused, without providing any evidence, of “advocating for the comm ission of c rime.” In October, Vice President F élix Ulloa said  that “some 
journalists should be prosecuted on slander and defamation charges” for criti-
cizing the government.  
In July, immigration authorities denied Daniel Lizárraga, a Mexican journalist 
working for El Faro , a work permit. According to  media reports, police interro-
gated Lizárraga prior to his appointment at the immigration office, asking whether he intended to “report on political issues.” He did not attend the ap-
pointment because, he told authorities, he had been exposed to Covid-19. A day later, he was expelled from the country.  
Key International Actors 
During fiscal year 2021, the US appropriat ed over US$65 million in bilateral aid 
to El Salvador, particularly to reduce extreme violence and strengthen state insti-tutions. In May, in response to growing concerns “about transparency and ac-countability,” the US Agency for International Development redirected 
assistanc e away from the Nation al Police and the Institute for Acce ss to Public 
Information, towar d civil society and h uman rights gr oups.  
Between July and September, the administration of US President Joe Biden in-
cluded 19 Salvadorans—including President Bukele’s legal advisor and his cabi-
225HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHnet chief, and all of the judges of the Constitutional Chamber—on the “Engel 
List” of individuals identified as having engaged in “significant corruption.”  
More than 178,000 Salvadorans were seeking asylum in other countries at the 
end of 2019, mostly in the United States. In fiscal year 2019, the last year data is available for, the US granted asylum to 3,212 Salvadorans—the third highest na-tionality ranking for asylum grants in the US. From 2013 through 2019, 138 Sal-vadorans were killed following deportation from the US; more than 70 were beaten, sexually assaulted, extorted, or tortured. 
In May, UN Secretary-General António Guterres flagged continuing concerns 
about “the procedures used in the remova l of the members of the constitutional 
chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and its impact on the control mecha-nisms in El Salvador,” and urged the government to “respect constitutional pro-visions, rule of law and separation of powers.”  
Also in May, UN High Comm issioner for Human Rights Michelle Ba chelet ex-
pressed concern about  the “the de cision by El Salv ador’s Legi slative Assembly 
to dismiss the magistrates of the Constit utional Cham ber of the Supreme Court 
of Justice and the Attorney General” as this “seriously undermines democracy and the rule of law in the country.” Similarly, the OAS Secretariat “reject[ed]” these dismissals. 
In February, the Int er-American Comm ission on Human Rights gr anted precau-
tionary measures to 34 members of El Faro , considering that they were facing 
“alleged ha rass ment, intimidation, thre ats and stigm atization ... related to the 
exercise of their freedom of expression in matt ers of public interest to their coun-
try.” 
226WORLD REPORT 2022Eritrea 
Eritrean government forces committed war crimes , possible crimes against hu-
manity, and other serious vi olations ag ainst Tigrayan civili ans during the ongo-
ing conflict  in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. Eritrean forces also  forcibly disappeared 
dozens of  Eritrean refugees living there, r aped sever al, coercively repatriated 
hundreds, and destroyed two Eritrean refugee camps. Eritrean forces also com-mitted widespread pillaging with 
much of the plunder taken back to Eritrea . 
At home, government repression persiste d, including through forced conscrip-
tion, mass roundups to  fill the army’s ranks and widespre ad forced  labor. The 
government also severely restricted fr eedom of expression, opinion, and faith.  
Eritrea has been ruled by its u nelected president, Isaias Af ewerki, s ince inde-
pendence in 1993, with no legislatur e, no independent civil soc iety organiza-
tions, and no independent judiciary. The transitional constitution, which guarantees civil rights, has never been implemented—remo ving all checks on 
Isaias’s arbitrary rule. 
September marked the 
20th anniversary  of the beginning of the government’s 
clampdown on perceived critics, including the arrest of 11 high ranking govern-ment officials and 10 journalists, and the closure of privately owned media out-lets. There has been no information on the whereabouts of 20 of the 21. 
War Crimes and Other Abuses in Tigray 
Eritrean Defense Forces  (EDF) committed widespread abuses  against civilians 
during its involvement in the conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray region alongside the 
Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) against forces aligned to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).  
On November 9, 2020, Human Rights Watch 
documented  artillery attacks 
launched from Eritrea hitting the Tigrayan town of Humera, in western Tigray. Er-itrean forces ha ve carried out la rge-scale massacres, 
summary executions , wide-
spread sexual violence  including rape, gang rape, and sexual slavery, 
widespread pillage , attacks on refugee camps , and destruction and pillaging of 
crops .   
227HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIndefinite Military Conscription and Forced Labor 
Human Rights Watch received credible reports of new roundups (“giffas”  in 
Tigrinya the most w idely spoken language) to help fi ll the army’s ra nks due to 
losses suffered during the war in Tigray, during which security forces reportedly block off certain ar eas and round up individuals perce ived as being of military 
age or trying to evade conscription. Relatives of those forced to fight in the Tigray region did not receive official feedback on the fate of their loved ones.  
A diaspora human rights organization 
reported  that a 16-year-old boy was picked 
up outside his home in Eritrea’s capital, Asmara, and trained for two months in Eritrea before disappearing. His family  heard about his whereabouts a month 
later when he was named as a pri soner of war by Tigrayan forces.  
Forced conscription and deployment to  the military also continued through the 
country’s 
infamous indefinite national service system.  Mostly men and unmar-
ried women were sent indefinitely into the mi litary or civil service for low pay and 
with no say in their profession or work  location. Conscripts are often subjected 
to inhuman and degrading punishment, including torture, without recourse. Con-scientious objection is not recognized; 
it is punished . Discharge from national 
service is arbitrary and procedures are opaque . 
For secondary students, some as young as 16, conscription begins at the Sawa 
military camp  where students finish secondary school and undergo compulsory 
military training.  Students are under military command, with harsh military pun-ishments and discipline, and female students have 
reported  sexual harass ment 
and exploitation.  
The government continued to rely on poorly trained national service teachers, 
which affects the quality of primary and secondary education, and teacher reten-tion.  
Unlawful, Prolonged, and Abusive Detentions  
Thousands of prisoner s languish in the co untry’s extensive  prison netw ork, held 
in overcrowded places of detention w ith inadequate food, water, and medical 
care. Many are held incommunicado and  detained indefinitely, denied basic due 
228WORLD REPORT 2022process rights, without acce ss to legal counsel , judicial review, or family visits, 
some for decades. 
In September 2001, Eritrean authoritie s arrested 11 government officials who had 
called on Isaias to introduce political reforms and 10 prominent journalists who 
reported on this. Among those detained was journalist Dawit Isaak , a dual Er-
itrean-Swedi sh citizen, who was briefly relea sed from jail in 2005, and re mains 
in incommunicado detention. At least 10  of the 21 initially arrested are reported 
to have died in detention.  
Other high profile detainees remain in incommunicado detention, including  
Ciham Ali Abdu , daughter of a former information minister, held since  December 
2012 when she was just 15 years old,  and former fin ance minister and  critic  of 
the president, Berhane Abrehe, detained  since September 2018 . The country’s 
massive prison population also includes draft evaders or “deserters,”  some of 
whom were detained while trying to flee the country, and individuals detained for their religious beliefs and practices.  
The US-based Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) released a 
documentary  in May 
which included f ootage that  was reportedly recorded by a former prisoner in Abi 
Abeito , one of the country’s military detention facilities, offering an insight into 
the horrific conditions. The film shows cells that are so overcrowded that prison-ers lie one on top of each other, unable to stretch out.  
Freedom of Religion  
For over tw o decades, the government  has denied religious liberty  to anyone 
whose religious affili ation does not match the four denominations that the gov-
ernment “recognizes:” Sunni Islam, Eritre an Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and 
Evangelical (Lutheran) churches. People affiliated with “unrecognized” faiths 
continue to be imprisoned, and to rture has been used to forc e them to renounce 
their religion.   
Positively, in the first two months of the year, the government released dozens of 
Evangelical and Orthodox Christian det ainees held for their religious beliefs and 
practices, who had reportedly  been detained for between 2 to 12 years. In addi-
tion, since late 2020 , 32 Jehovah Witnesses  were released, including three con-
scientious objectors who had been detained since 1994. Despite these releases, 
229HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH20 Jehovah Witnesses are still detained , and the government continued to se-
verely restrict religious freedoms and arrest people  because of their religious 
practices.  
Refugees  
Eritrea’s ongoing rights cr isis c ontinues to dr ive Eritreans  into exile, including 
children and youth escaping conscription.   
For decades, Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region, just south of the border with Er-
itrea, had been one of the main destinations for Eritrean refugees. At the start of the conflict in November 2020, around 96 ,000 Eritrean refugees were registered 
in Tigray. 
Between November, 2020 and January, 2021  Eritrean forces twice occupied Hit-
sats and Shimelba camps hosting Eritrean refugees in Tigray near the country’s border and subjected camp residents to enforced disappearances, rape, and co-ercive repatr iations before dest roying the camps. During these two months Er-
itrean forces also targeted Tigrayans living in the surrounding communities, including through killings and widespre ad pillaging, resulting in significant ten-
sions between Tigrayans and the Eritrean refugee community. As of September, 
over 7 ,500  refugees from both camps remained unaccounted for.  
Covid-19  
Eritrea refused  to join the UN-led COVAX initiative to receive Covid-19 vaccine 
supplies and is  reportedly  yet to start a vaccination campaign.  
Covid-related restrictions kept schools largely closed during the first three 
months of the year, disrupting education  for more than 600,000 students. How-
ever, the government continued to force final year high-school students to at-tend Sawa, where dormitories are crowded, and water supplies and health 
facilities limited. Students were not relea sed from Sawa despite concerns that 
the virus that  causes Covid-1 9 could easily sp read in the cramped and  unsanitary 
conditions.  
230WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors 
Media reported  in February that the United Arab Emirates had begun to disman-
tle parts of its military base near the port of Assab. The base, established in 2015, had supported UAE’s intervention in the Yemen conflict.  
In March, the European Union 
designated  Eritrea’s national security agency, 
under its global human rights sanctions regime, for serious human rights abuses including killings, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and torture com-
mitted by its agents. The Europe an Comm ission 
announced  that around €1 mil-
lion (US$1.1 million) funds allocated to Eritrea under the EU’s Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) would be reallocated, citing a lack of interest on the part of Eritrea. This followed fierce criticism in 2020, including by 
the European Parlia-
ment , of the EU’s funding of the procurement of materials  for the construction of 
a road in Eritrea that employed conscript forced labor.   
In August, the US imposed  targeted sanctions on General Filipos Woldey-
ohannes, the chief of staff of the Eritrean Defense Forces (EDF), for serious 
human rights abuses committed by the Eritrean forces in Tigray.  
In September, the Biden administration issued an executive order  enabling the 
United States to sanction individuals “res ponsible for, or complicit in, prolong-
ing the conflict in Ethiopia, obstructing humanitarian access, or preventing a ceasefire.” On November 12, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of For-eign Assets Control (OFAC) designated four Eritrean entities and two individuals.  
The 
EU, US, and African members on the UN Security Council  repeatedly called 
on Eritrea to withdraw its troops from Ethiopia. repeatedly called on Eritrea to withdraw its troops from Ethiopia.  
231HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHEswatini 
In 2021, Eswatini, an absolute mon archy ruled by King Mswati III sinc e 1986, was 
rocked by waves of protests amid a drastic deterioration in the human rights sit-uation and lack of reforms. The authorities responded by banning protests and deployed police and so ldiers who shot at protesters indiscriminately with 
live ammunition.  A 1973 decree banning political parties remains in force. De-spite the adoption of the 2005 constitution which guarantees basic rights and 
the country’s international human rights commitments, the king continues to ex-ercise absolute power to appoint the prime mini ster and cabinet, and to dissolve 
the Parliament. 
Conduct of Security Forces  
In June, violent protests triggered by the king’s decree banning petitions to the 
government calling for democratic reforms broke out across the country. Accord-ing to media reports at least 50 people we re killed and property worth an esti-
mated R3 billion (US$19.4 mi llion) was looted or damaged. The waves of 
protests began in May 2021, when students and teachers protested the killing of Thabani Nkomonye, a law student at the University of Swaziland. The killing was allegedly committed by the police. The authorities initiated an investigation into 
the killing, but protests escalated in late June when about 500 youths took to the streets in the Manzini district, 30 ki lometers from the capital, Mbabane.  
The government has yet to r atify the Optional Pr otocol to the Convention Against 
Torture, despite previously agreeing to do so. 
Freedom of Association and Assembly 
Restrictions on freedom of association and assembly continued in 2021. The Eswatini authorities have used the Suppression of Terrorism Act of 2008 (Terror-
ism Act) and the Sedition and Subversive Activities Act of  1938 (Sedition Act) to 
suppress free speech and stifle criticism of the monarch. On July 25, the police 
arrested two Eswatini members of parli ament (MPs), and charged them with ter-
rorism for allegedly encouraging the protests and calling for a democratically elected prime minister and other reforms. The two MPs, Mduduzi Bacede 
232WORLD REPORT 2022Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube, remain in custody after the High Court of Eswatini 
denied their bail application twice. At the time of writing, the trial had yet to commence.  
Rule of Law and Media Freedoms 
There has been no progre ss on essenti al rights ref orms, including the removal of 
all legislative and practical rest rictions to free ex ercise of civil and political 
rights. This would include the repeal or amendment of laws that obstruct the rights to freedom of association and express ion, that would allow the registra-
tion and operation of political parties; introducing great er political freedoms 
through free, fair, transparent democratic elections; ensuring the right to health without di scrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity; abo-
lition of the death penalty; and decriminalization of same-sex relations and the prevention of discrimination based on marital status and sexual orientation.  
Restrictions on freedom of association and assembly remained in place and 
there were no remedies for violations that  occurred in previous years. On Octo-
ber 20, 2020, the High Court heard a challenge by the Eswatini Sexual and Gen-der Minorities (ESGM), a human rights community-based advocacy organization which aims to advance the protection of hum an rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and intersex per sons. In September 2019, the Eswatini Registrar of 
Companies had refused to register ESGM as a company saying that “ESGM’s ob-
jectives were unla wful because same-sex sexual acts  are illeg al in the country.” 
At the time of writing the court has not render ed its judgment.  
In 2021, Eswatini ranked 141 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Bor-
ders’ world press index on media freedom, based partly on constraints journal-
ists face under the absolute monarchy and  because courts are not permitted to 
prosecute crimes and abuses against r epresentatives of the monarchy. In June, 
the Eswatini Communic ations Comm ission allegedly  ordered netw ork providers, 
Eswatini Post and Telecommunications, Eswatini MTN and Eswatini Mobile to shut down the internet to pr event protesters from mobilizing online. Local ac-
tivists in Eswatini told Human Rights  Watch that the internet  was shut down for 
several hours, from about 4:30 p.m. local time on June 29 until around 9 a.m. on June 30.  
233HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn June 30, media groups African Fr eedom of Expression Exchange (AFEX), Col-
laboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), In-ternational Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), Panos Institute Southern 
Africa, and the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) sent a joint petition to 
the acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku calling on him to ensure that the in-ternet, social media platforms, and a ll other communication channels are open, 
secure, and accessible regardless of the protests then taking place in the coun-try. 
Women’s Rights  
The under-repre sentation of w omen in leadership and decis ion-making posi-
tions in both public and private sectors continued, with little effort to implement provisions of the 2018 Election of Women Act. The Act is designed to ensure the fulfillment of  the constitution al requirement  of rep resentation quo tas for women 
and marginalized groups in parliament.  
While it is yet to ratify the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ 
Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protoco l), Eswatini has r atified 
some regional and international instr uments to promote gender equality. These 
include the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which Eswatini ratified without reservation and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Declaration on Gender and Develop-ment. Article 20 of the Constitution prov ides for equality before the law and non-
discrimination on several protected grounds, but does not include 
discrimin ation on the b asis of l anguage, sexual  orientation, or gender identity. 
Eswatini’s dual legal system where both the common law, which is based on Roman Dutch law and Eswatini unwritten customary law operate side by side, 
has resulted in c onflicts, resulting in numerous violations of  women’s rights  over 
the years.  
Children’s Rights 
Schools were closed for 237 days, and partially open to certain ages or in certain areas, for 159 days since the pandemic’s start in 2020. In 2021, 350,000 stu-dents were affected. Before the pandemic, 16 percent of ch ildren were out of pri-
mary school. 
234WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors  
In July, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chairperson of the 
Organ Troika on Politics, Defence and Security, deployed two fact finding mis-
sions to investigate the causes of the protests and help find peaceful resolution to the political crisis in the country. SADC appealed for calm and restraint from 
all the stakeholders in Eswatini, and encouraged national dialogue.  
South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pan-
dor, who was part of the delegation, expressed  disappoint ment over the Eswa-
tini fact-finding m ission. Pandor said, “I was quit e disappointed, we were on a 
fact-finding m ission and what we found in Swaziland  [Eswatini] was that our col-
leagues in government essentially want ed government to brief us when we 
wanted a wider set of briefing as we wished to speak to the broader stakehold-ers including non-government stak eholders.” The reports of the SADC fact-find-
ing miss ions were not made public.  
In July, the Commonwealth secretariat issued a statement calling for calm and re-
straint and  urging all political and  civic leaders to  demons trate to lerance, to pro-
mote unity, and give a chance to peaceful channels to address any grievances. It said its Secretary-General will continue to work with regional and international partners to encourage constructive  dialogue and appropriate demarches 
founded on the rule of law as a means to foster sustainable peace.  
Also in response to the violent protes ts, the United Nations Secretary-General 
António Guterres called on the Eswatini authorities to ensure people are able to 
exercise their civil and po litical rights pe acefully and  urged the security fo rces to 
exercise utmost restr aint. The UN office of the high commiss ioner for human 
rights urged the government to “ensure that  there are prompt, tr ansparent, effec-
tive, independent and impartial investig ations into all allegations of human 
rights violations.”

in Ethiopia’s Tigray RegionHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Ethiopia  
The human rights and humanitarian situation in Ethiopia deteriorated further in 
2021, with civilians impacted by the devas tating Tigray  conflict, security force 
abuses, attacks by armed groups, and deadly ethnic violence in other regions. 
The government’s actions in Tigray contributed to growing international pressure to address accountability for rights abuses. 
In Tigray, government forces and allies committed 
forcible displacement , large-
scale  massacres , widespread sexual violence , indiscriminate shelling,  pillage, 
and attacks on  schools  and  hospitals . By mid-year, these abuses had left an es-
timated 350,000 people facing starvation. After government forces withdrew 
from many parts of Tigray in late June, it imposed an effective siege on Tigray, blocking 
virtually all humanitarian aid from reaching the region , violating inter-
national humanitarian law and possibly committing the war crime of using star-vation as a weapon of war. The conflict spread into the Amhara and Afar regions resulting in large-scale displacement. Tigrayan fo rces were also implicated in se-
rious abuses against Amhara civili ans.  
Elections took place in an environment marred by restrictions on free expression 
and association, and insecurity in sever al regions. In June, the ruling political 
party was r e-elected for a five-year term.  
In western Oromia, government count erinsurgency campaigns against armed 
rebel groups resulted in serious abuses  committed by all sides against commu-
nities. Attacks against Amhara commu nities by armed groups and unidentified 
gunmen also increased.  
Accountability for past and present abuses remained minimal. In Tigray, the 
prime minister 
admitted  forces engaged in looting and sexual violence but 
downplayed the severity of abuses. For months, the government denied the presence of Eritrean forces and resisted international investigations. A joint in-vestigation into abuses in Tigray by the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights 
Commiss ion and the Unit ed Nations Office of the High C ommiss ioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) 
concluded  that there have been widespread violations of inter-
national human rights, humanitarian and refugee law by all parties to the con-
237HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHflict in Tigray, some of which may amount to international crimes, in particular, 
war crimes and crimes against humanity.   
Tigray Conflict  
Ethiopian federal and allied forces committed widespread abuses in Tigray.  
In western Tigray, Amhara regional forces and militias carried out numerous 
abuses and forcibly displaced thousands of Tigrayans  in what the US secretary of 
state in March characterized as “ethnic cleansing.” 
 In January, Ethiopian and Eritrean forces rounded up and executed dozens of un-
armed men after attacking several villages surrounding Mahbere Dego , in central 
Tigray. On March 23, Ethiopian soldiers forced passengers off a public bus in 
northeastern Tigray, separated the men fr om the women, and executed at least 
four men . On June 22, a government airstrike hit a market in Togoga village , cen-
tral Tigray, reportedly killing at least 51 people and injuring scores. Government strikes in Tigray 
continued in October .  
Ethiopian authorities blocked roads into the region and only allowed sporadic 
humanitarian access. The destruction and pillage of health facilities prevented 
survivors of conflict-relat ed sexual vio lence from accessing health services .  
On June 28, after the defeat of Ethiopian government forces in Tigray, Ethiopian 
authorities declared a . Retreating Ethiopian soldiers raided  UNICEF  and World 
Food Programme offices in the regional capital, Mekelle, and looted communica-tions equipment. Since then, the government has impo sed wh at the UN has 
called a de facto blockade on Tigr ay. Electricity and fuel supplies 
reached dan-
gerous lows  in September, communications and banking remained  shut, and ac-
cess to cash was severely  limited .  
In August, Ethiopia suspended  three nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), in-
cluding the Norwegian Refugee Council, Médec ins Sans Frontières (MSF), and Al 
Maktoume Foundation for three months. On September 30, Ethiopia expelled 
seven senior UN officials . Twenty-three aid workers have been killed since the 
conflict began, including three MSF workers murdered on June 24 .   
The conflict expanded into the neighboring Amhara and Afar regions in July, dis-
placing hundreds of thousands . Tigrayan forces summarily executed Amhara 
civilians and were implicat ed in the pillage of  civili an property. On August 5 in 
238WORLD REPORT 2022Galikoma, Afar, dozens of civilians were reportedly killed and injured near a 
school and health facility . In the Amhara region, fighting between Tigrayan 
forces and Ethiopian and allied forces intensified. In August and September, Tigrayan fighters summarily executed Amhara residents in 
Chenna  and Kobo , 
and committed rape, including gang rape in Nifas Mewcha  and Geregera  in the 
Amhara region. 
Outside Tigray, Ethiopian authorities arbitrarily detained , forcibly disappeared, 
and arbitrarily closed businesses of scores of ethnic Tigrayans in Addis Ababa. 
Arrests of Tigrayans increased  following the government’s declaration of a 
sweeping state of emer gency on November 4 . 
Security Force Abuses, Attacks  by Armed Groups, Communal 
Violence  
Extrajudicia l killings, mass arres ts, arbi trary detentions, and vio lence against 
civilians occurred in other r egions facing unrest and insecurity.  
In Oromia, reports of  arrests, detention, and summary executions  of Or omo civi l-
ians accused of supporting the armed rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Army 
(OLA), continued. In May, security forces in Dembi Dollo, western Oromia, vio-
lently apprehended  a 17-year-old boy and then summ arily execut ed him in pub-
lic.  
Armed groups c arried out att acks against officials, po lice, and civili ans, includ-
ing killings and lootings in western Oromia . In late March, OLA rebels reportedly 
killed at least 28 Amhara  civili ans and injured ov er a dozen in B abo Gembel West 
Wellega zone.  
Tensions over politics and land administration  in Benishangul-Gumuz fueled vio-
lence , with summary executions of A mharas and other ethnic grou ps by armed 
militias, particularly in Metekel zone, escalating .  
In the Amhara region, an imam’s killing in March triggered  inter-communal vio-
lence in the North Shewa and Oromia Special zones . Hundreds of Amhara and 
Oromo residents were reportedly killed , over 200,000 people displaced, and 
large-scale property damaged . Thousands of minority Qimant residents also fled 
239HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHto Sudan mid-year after Ethiopian milit ary forces and Amhara militias reportedly 
attacked villages . 
Conflict  between Afar and Somali communities over disputed boundaries inten-
sified, with the reported involvement of regional armed forces on both sides, 
killing hundreds in March and July and displacing thousands.  
Elections and Political Space  
Ethiopia’s sixth national elections were held in two stages, after two initial post-
ponements . The first on Ju ne 21, was held  in most electoral constituencies ; the 
second in the Somali and Harari regions on September 30 after reported voting 
irregularities , and in 12 constituencies in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, 
and People’s (SNNPR ) region. Voting did not take place in Tigray  or in parts of 
Oromia, Amhara, Afar, and Benishangul-Gumuz regions due to insecurity . 
On July 10, Ethiopi a’s electoral board declared  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s 
Prosperity Party the winner, after sec uring most seats in Ethiopia’s parliament . 
On October 4, Prime Minister Ab iy was sw orn in for a new five-year term .   
More parties and candidates competed than in the past, and internally dis-
placed persons ( IDPs) were able to cast their vote  in some areas, but the pre-
electoral period was marred by violence and insecurity in several regions  and 
accusations  by oppos ition parties of a rep ressive operating environment. 
Two opposition candidates, Girma Moges of EZEMA  and Berihun Asferaw of 
NAMA , were assassinated in Oromia  and Benishangul-Gumuz region in February 
and April.  
In Oromia, the country’s biggest r egional constituency, the ruling Prosperity 
Party ran unopposed, after the main opposition parties, the Oromo Federalist 
Congress  (OFC) and the Oromo Liberation Front  (OLF), boycotted  the election, cit-
ing intimidation of supporters and the detention of party leaders .  
In the Somali region, on September 17 , the Ogaden National Liberation Front 
(ONLF) withdrew  from the elections alleging attacks on candidates and members 
and blocks on registration . 
240WORLD REPORT 2022The incumbent party faced stiff competition in the Amhara region, but opposi-
tion parties submitted several complaints  to the National Election Board alleging  
voter and observer intimidation by local officials and militias.   
Due Process Rights and Fair Trial  
On January 27 , Ethiopian authorities arrested dozens of supporters of detained  
Oromo politicians in Addis Ababa outside a court hearing. Twenty senior Oromo political detainees began a 
hunger strike in protest . Oromo politician Bekele 
Gerba’s health worsened . In February, authorities defied a court clearance to 
transfer him to a private hospital, forcibly took him to an army hospital, and 
briefly detained his doctor . 
Authorities also blocked  Lidetu Ayalew from the Ethiopian Democratic Party 
(EDP) from leaving the country for medical purposes three times, citing several 
reasons , including Lidetu’s objection to the Tigray war. 
On February 14, security  forces arrested Oromo Mo hammed De ksisso,  a graduat-
ing student in Jimma, after calling for  the release of Oromo politicians and jus-
tice for murdered  Oromo singer Hac halu Hundessa. Mohammed was held  for five 
months, faced serious due proce ss violations before his release .  
Freedom of Expression, Media, and Association  
Government attacks and restrictions on the media and free expression in-
creased .  
In January, government forces  shot dead  Tigrayan journalist Dawit Kebede Araya 
in Mekelle. In May, Sisay Fida, a journalist with Oromia Broadcasting Network , 
was killed in western Oromia. 
Journalists and outspoken public figures reporting or critiquing rights abuses 
linked to the Tigray conflict faced intimidation , expulsion from the country , and 
arrest . On July 15, the Ethiopia  Media Authority temporarily suspended  Addis 
Standard , a leading news outlet in Ethiopia “ claiming it  was adv ancing the 
agenda of the TPLF .”  
In March, Ethiopian security forces briefly detained three media workers and one 
journalist  in Tigray in a military camp. In e arly July, police arrested 10 Awlo Media 
241HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHjournalists and media workers and tw o EthioForum journalists; they were held 
incommunicado for weeks befor e their release in August.   
On September 30, security forces arrested Abra ha Desta , a former official in 
Ethiopia’s interim administration in Tigray, after he published an open letter de-
nouncing arbitrary arrests and discrimination against ethnic Tigrayans  in Addis 
Ababa.  
Ethiopian authorities passed a nationwide stat e of emergency November 4 , 
granting the government far-reaching powers that heighten the risks of arbitrary 
arrest and detention against at-risk communities, but could have a chilling effect on humanitarian act ivities, induce self -censorship by the media, act ivist groups, 
and human rights  organizations, and  risk emboldening a busive elements within 
the security forces. 
The government maintained an internet s hutdown in Tigray throughout the year. 
Telephone connections were sporadic through June when they were shut off again.  
Refugees  
Between November 2020 and January 2021, Eritrean forces and Tigrayan militia 
alternatively occupied Hitsats and Shimelba refugee camps in Tigray and com-
mitted killings, sexual violence, arbitrary detention, forcible disappearances, 
and looting  against scores of the 20,000 Eritrean refugees living in these camps. 
In January, Eritrean forces destroyed  large parts of the camps, which were empty 
of refugees by March. Fighting in mid-July in Mai Aini and Adi Harush , the re-
gion’s two other functioning camps, left Eritrean refugees in urgent need of pro-tection and  assist ance.  
Until August, Eritrean refugees fleeing to Addis Ababa from Tigray received no 
protection. Finally, ARRA with UNHCR 
began  issuing three-ye ar temporary identi-
fication documents to Eritrean refugees who had relocated to Addis from Tigray, 
enabling them to a ccess assist ance and services.   
242WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors  
Ethiopia’s relations with some of its regional neighbors and donors significantly 
worsened, particularly over the conflict in Tigray . The UN Security Council’s abil-
ity to add ress the crisis was largely  nullified by China, Ru ssia, and India. Kenya, 
Niger, and Tunisia, in July called  for a comprehen sive cea sefire, humanit arian ac-
cess, and exp ressed support for an inquiry led  by the African Comm ission on 
Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR). These calls did little to encourage substan-tive Security Council action. 
The US repeatedly condemned the human rights abuses committed by warring 
parties in Tigray. In March, Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
characterized  the 
Ethiopian government’s actions in Western Tigray as “ethnic cleansing.” On Sep-tember 18, President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order that established a sanctions regime on individuals and entities responsible for 
human rights 
abuses in northern Ethiopia and for obstructing humanitarian aid.   
On January 15, the European Union  announced  US$107 million and the UK com-
mitted  £75 million in humanitari an assist ance. The UK and EU leadership  repeat-
edly condemned abuses.  The EU  urged member states  to consider imposing 
“restrictive measures” on Ethiopia. In May, the EU withdrew its elections ob-
servers , citing a failure to agree with the government, including over its ability to 
operate independently. On October 4, the Eu ropean Parliament adopted a reso-
lution  urging sanctions against those responsible for abuses and for obstructing 
humanitarian aid, for an arms embargo, and for a robust intern ational investiga-
tive mechanism. On October 18, EU foreign ministers agreed to prepare ground 
for targeted sanctions on Ethiopia .  
The African Union remained the only international body to monitor the June elec-
tions and declared them to be “credible ,” despite irregularities and insecurity in 
several regions. 
In November, the Office of the UN High C ommiss ioner for Hum an Rights (OHCHR) 
and the EHRC published the report of their joint investigation into human rights 
violations and abuses committed by all parties in the context of the Tigray con-flict between November 3, 2020, and June 28, 2021. The report acknowledges it 
was 
not a compr ehensive  investigation  and calls for further independent investi-
gations and for accountability.   
243HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn June, the ACHPR launched  a commission of inquiry into violations committed 
in Tigray. In response, Ethiopian authorities ur ged it to “immediately cease,” 
proposing a joint probe with the national EHRC instead, which the inquiry re-jected
 citing concerns  around independence. 
Relations with Egypt and Sudan  remained tense . Disputes between Ethiopia and 
Sudan over the contested territory of al-Fashaga  increased, resulting in several open clashes.
244WORLD REPORT 2022European Union 
The European Union and most member states continue to espouse a commit-
ment to human rights and democratic values. In practice, however, the policies and actions of the union and member states often fall short.  
On migration, the response to the crisis in Afghanist an, the humanit arian emer-
gency at the Poland-Belarus border, and pushbacks at that and other external EU borders exemplified a focus on sealing bor ders and externalizing responsibility 
for refugees, migrants, and asylum seek ers at the expense of human rights. 
State responses to racism, violenc e, and discrimination, affecting women, ethnic 
and religious minorities, lesbian, gay, bi sexual and transgender (LGBT) people, 
and people with disabilitie s, are often inadequate and in some cases exacerbate 
rights abuse.  
The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated deep inequality and poverty in the Euro-
pean Union, despite some state measures to mitigate it. EU member states used stronger rhetoric to criticize attacks on the rule of law and democratic institu-
tions inside the EU, but fell short of ta king de cisive action available under the EU 
treaties or fully activating financial conditionality mechanisms. 
Migrants, Refugees, and Asylum Seekers  
EU member states evacuated thousands of  Afghans from Kabul in August after 
the Taliban takeover but subsequently focused largely on measures to keep peo-ple fleeing Afghanistan in neighboring countries. During a high-level EU forum on providing protection to Afghans at ri sk, convened in October, EU member 
states did not make any concrete resettlement pledges.  
In May, Spain 
summarily returned  thousands of peop le, including unaccompa-
nied children, from Ceuta after an estim ated 10,000 people ent ered the Spanish 
North African enclave within 24 hours with alleged facilitation by Morocco.  
Lithuania , Latvia , and Poland  declared states of emergency, deployed troops, 
and unlawfully pushed people back int o Belarus after saying that Bel arus author-
ities were facilitating people, including Iraq is and Afghans, entering EU states. In 
August, the European Court of Human Rights ordered Latvia and Poland  to pro-
245HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHvide assistanc e to groups of Ir aqi and Afghan a sylum seekers, respect ively, stuck 
at the Belarus border, but reserved for a full hearing the question of whether 
they should be admitted to  their territory. The situation escalated significantly in 
November, with thousands of people in dire wintery conditions at the Poland-Be-
larus border, and estimates that at least nine people had died  in the area.  
According to the UN refugee agency , over 103,889 people arrived irregularly at 
the EU’s southern borders by mid-November 2021, most by sea, while at least 1,319 died or w ent miss ing in the Mediterr anean Sea, alm ost as many  (1,401) as 
in all of 2020. The 
International Organization for Migration (IOM)  estimates that 
1,563 people died at the Mediterranean, and recorded 785 dead or disappeared  
in the Atlantic Ocean on their way to Spain’s Canary Islands in the first eight months of 2021. The death toll may be much higher; the nongovernmental or-ganization (NGO) Walking Borders said almost 
2,000 had died  in the first six 
months alone.  
The EU and member states continued to cooperate with Libya, including to facili-
tate interceptions at sea and disembark ation in Libya, despite known risks of ar-
bitrary detention, torture, and other abuses. At least 27 ,551 people—well over 
double the total for 2020—wer e disembarked in Libya in the first 10 months of 
2021. A UN inquiry published in October  said the litany of inhumane acts against 
migrants in Libya may amount to crimes against humanity, adding that the re-sponsibility of other countries needs to be investigated. 
The 
Council of Europe c ommiss ioner for human rights  and the UN high commis-
sioner for human rights , in March and May respectively, urged the EU to conduct 
search and rescue in the Mediterranean Sea, stop obstructing the work of non-governmental rescue organizations, and condition cooperation with Libya on re-spect for human rights. As of September, only five NGO rescue vessels were 
operational, with groups alleging obstruction by Italy and Malta.  
In June, 
Denmark amended its immigration law  so it can send asylum seekers to 
another country for examination of their claim, without any guarantee of reloca-tion to Denmark if successful. The 
African Union strongly condemned  the move 
in August, and to date no country is on record as agreeing to host offshore pro-cessing.  
246WORLD REPORT 2022A European Parliament investigation concluded  in July that the EU Border and 
Coast Guard Agency, commonly known as Fron tex, failed to take action to stop 
unlawful pushback s, ignoring reports and  deliberat ely delay ing hiring rights 
monitors. Despite having numerous a ccountability mechanisms, Frontex has 
failed to credibly investigate or mitigate pushbacks  where they were operating. 
In late October, the European Parliament froze  part of the agency’s budget until 
it makes improvements related to human rights.  
In September, the Eu ropean C ommiss ion noted slow progress  on implementing 
its 2020  Pact on Migration and Asylum , with notably limited momentum to cre-
ate more safe and legal migration pathways and towards more equitable sharing of responsibility for asylum seekers. Steps towards creating independent border 
monitoring mechanisms envisioned  in the pact fell short of guarantees to ensure 
such mechanisms would contribute to accountability and to ending illegal push-backs. 
Discrimination and Intolerance  
The Covid-19 pandemic fuelled  discrimination and hate crimes particularly 
against migrants and Roma people, according to a June EU Fundamental Rights Agency report.  
The European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) said in a 
March report that the pandemic had a 
dire impact  on schooling during the 2020-
2021 academic year, including in EU member states. Inequalities were exacer-
bated  particularly for marginalized  and socially disadvantaged  children and 
those in greater need of educational support such as children with disabilities . 
A June report by the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) found in some coun-
tries asylum seekers and undocumented migrants faced difficulties in accessing 
Covid-19 vaccines, but other countries wa ived formal requirements to facilitate 
access. 
In response to incr easing antisemitism and  attacks on Jews in many parts of Eu-
rope, including online hate speech, the CoE’s  European C ommission against 
Racism and Intolerance issued a General Policy Recommendation  in September 
calling on European countries including EU states to tackle the issue and in Oc-
247HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtober, the Eur opean Comm ission publi shed a strategy  on combatting anti-
semitism. 
A May survey by the FRA on police stops across the EU  found that overall ethnic 
minorities, Muslims, and those who do not identify as heterosexual were among those most often stopped. It also foun d that those who experience ethnic profil-
ing place less trust in public authorities than those who do not.  
The pandemic highlighted a 
stark rise in abuse and hate speech  against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender and interse x (LGBTI) people, problems accessing 
health care including for LGBTI people with disabilities . A survey published in 
April found increased vulnerability to homelessness  for LGBTI young people 
linked to the pandemic.  
The FRA called in July  on EU countries to remove b arriers that prevent hate crime 
victims from coming fo rward, and to encourage reporting by tack ling struc tural 
discrimination and prejudice in society, eliminating discriminatory policing, pub-licly condemning hate crime and raising victims’ awareness of their rights and support available. 
In March, the Council of Europe commiss ioner for human rights, Du nja Mija tović, 
expressed concern about people of African descent ’s continued exposure to 
racist violence, racial profiling or other grave forms of racism and racial discrimi-nation in Europe including in EU states. 
Violence and ha rassment on the grounds of gender and se x, including for 
LGBTI 
people , remained widespread. A FRA survey  published in March found that 83 
percent of women and girls aged between 16 and 29 limit where they go or who 
they spend time with to protect themselv es; over 1 in 4 women (28 percent) re-
ported having been v ictims of ha rassment in the year before the survey, and 
women were significantly  more likely to experienc e sexual ha rassment than 
men; when women face non-sexual physical vi olence, they said it is most often 
by a family member or a relative ( 32 percent) and frequently in their own homes 
(37 percent). More than two thirds of res pondents said they did not report inci-
dents of violence to the police. At time of writing, six member states and the EU had yet to ratify the CoE 
Istanbul Convention  on combatting and preventing vio-
lence against women; some member states were actively opposing ratification or threatening to withdraw from the convention. 
248WORLD REPORT 2022A March study  by the European Institute for Gender Equality found that while all 
27 EU countries had taken steps to support and protect women victims of inti-mate partner vio lence and their children in the context of Covid-19, only a hand-ful had compr ehensive  action plans to add ress the situation. 
In March, the Eur opean C ommiss ion 
adopted  a strategy for the rights of persons 
with disabilities 2021-2030 , prioritizing accessibility; deinstitutionalization and 
independent living; countering discrimination and achieving equal access in em-ployment, justice, education, health, and political participation; and promoting disability rights globally. The 2021 Fundamental Rights Agency annual report noted 
particular risks for people with disabilities in institutions  during the Covid-
19 pandemic, as well as increased obstacle s to accessing essential services, ed-
ucation, and healthcare. 
The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) ruled in July  to permit employers to 
discriminate against people who wear r eligious dress, raising concerns about 
protection of religious freedom for Muslim women in particular. 
Poverty and Inequality  
Official estimates  suggested that 91.4 million people across the EU (around a 
fifth of the population), of whom 17.9 million were children, are at risk of poverty 
or social exclusion  (defined as living with severe material deprivation or chronic 
underemployment), with inequality levels static or worsening since the 2008-9 
financial crisis.  
The European Food Ba nks F ederation  estimated in September that its member 
organizations were providing food aid to 12.8 million people in need, an in-crease of 34.7 percent compared to pre-pandemic situation, highlighting a sharp 
increase in aid provided to people who had lost their jobs. Temporary financial relief from governments in many EU states helped partly mitigate the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on inequality, which 
nonetheless widened . 
The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty concluded  a visit to  EU institu-
tions in January warning  that national governments and regional institutions 
needed to prioritize socioeconomic rights and “rethink [their] fundamental eco-nomic rules” to make meaningful headway on reducing poverty in the coming 
249HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHdecade, and noting the disproportionate imp act of poverty on women, people 
with disabilities, older people, and Roma. 
In March, the Eu ropean Commiss ion adopted the European Child Guarantee , 
spurred by concerns  of increasing child pove rty during the p andemic, setting out 
specific steps on children’s right to f ood and right to an adequate standard of 
living. The Eur opean C ommiss ion proposal  for the European Council calls on 
Member States “to guarantee for children in need effective access to healthy nu-
trition and adequate housing.” 
In May, EU member states signed the Porto Declaration  committing to the imple-
mentation of a European Pillar of Social Rights , confirming a target to remove 15 
million people from poverty by 2030, and setting out a need to modernize mini-mum incomes schemes across the EU. The UN special rapporteur on extreme 
poverty 
assessed  the Porto Declaration’s tar gets as “insufficiently ambitious.” 
Anti-poverty and environmental groups criticized  the European Commission’s 
announcement in July of a legislative package on energy  for failing to protect 
people on low-incomes from fluctuating energy prices and for insufficiently ad-
dressing emiss ion reduction targets. As energy prices ro se, by Octo ber re-
searchers estimated some 80 million households  would struggle to meet energy 
costs during the winter. 
Roma people remained at disproportionate risk of living in poverty and social ex-
clusion. Roma rights act ivists documented  anti-Roma discrimination and segre-
gation in housing, evictions and lack of access to water, sanitation and essential public services in some EU countries, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, and Slovakia. The European Roma Rights Center 
reported  that Roma children were ov errepresented in state care in 
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Slovakia, often as a 
byproduct of discriminatory policy, poverty, and social exclusion. 
Rule of Law 
Hearings on Poland and Hungary under Article 7—the EU treaty procedure to scrutinize threats to EU values on rights and  rule of law—took place in the EU 
Council in 
June  2021.  
250WORLD REPORT 2022In June, 18 EU member states  jointly condemned the Hungarian legislation dis-
criminating against LGBT people. In a June resolution , the European Parliament 
called on the Council to issue concrete rule-of-law recommendations to Hungary and Poland under Article 7.  
In 
July, the European Parliament condemned Hungary’s anti-LGBT law and other 
attacks on the rule of law. In September , it criticized the deterioration of media 
freedom and the erosion of judicial independence in Poland. In October , it called 
on the Comm ission to launch an infringement against Poland  on the functioning 
and composition of the Constit utional Trib unal, following a decision by the tribu-
nal that undermines EU law.  
In October, the EU Court of Justice impo sed a daily €1 million (approximately 
US$1,132,000) penalty on Poland for failing to respect a CJEU request  in July to 
block a 2020 law undermining judges’ independence. In September, the EU Commission 
opened a follow-up procedure  against Poland for failing to imple-
ment a separate CJEU ruling  that found the disciplinary regime against judges 
was illegal. In July, the comm ission initiated another legal procedure  against 
Poland over “LGBT-ideology free zones” in several municipalities. In October, EU 
Commiss ion President Ursul a Von der Leyen stated she was deeply concerned  by 
the ruling of Poland’s compromised Cons titutional Tribunal on the unconstitu-
tionality of EU law, and committed to use all the powers under the treaties to protect the binding natur e of CJEU rulings. 
The comm ission opened a follo w-up case in 
February  against Hungary for failing 
to implement 2020 CJEU ruling finding illegal the law on foreign-funded NGOs,  
and requested in November that the CJEU orders financial penalties on Hungary 
for failing to implement a December 2020 Court ruling finding the asylum law  il-
legal. In November, the CJEU ruled  that Hungary’s 2018 asylum law  that re-
stricted access to international prot ection and criminalized legitimate activities 
in support of migr ants breached  EU law. The commiss ion opened new leg al in-
fringements against Hungary for forcing independent station Klubradio  off air, 
and in July for the law violating the rights of LGBT people . 
A European Parliament Monitoring Group  continued to assess situations in other 
EU countries, including Bulgaria, Slo vakia, Slovenia, and Malta.  
251HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn July, the Eur opean Comm ission relea sed its second rule of law report  covering 
all 27 EU state s. In September, C ommiss ion President Von Der Leyen announced  
that from 2022, the rule of law reports  would come with specific recommenda-
tions to member states, and committed to introduce a media freedom legislation 
within a year.  
At time of writing, the c ommission had not yet starte d using the new rule of law 
conditionality mechanism for EU funding, prompting a legal challenge by Euro-pean Parliament arians. The comm ission in September expl ained that  delays in 
approving Poland’s and Hungary’s Covid recovery funds were justified by rule of law concerns. In September, four Polish regions revoked their anti-LGBT declara-tions for fear of losing EU funds earmarked to the regions. 
Lack of accountability for the killing of journalists for their work remains a con-
cern. In an 
April resolution , the European Parliament urged Malta to bring to jus-
tice the perpetrators of the 2017 murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. In February, one of the thr ee accused of the murder was sentenced to 15 years of 
prison; the other two were awaiting trial. In August, Malta’s attorney general called for life sentence against 
Yorgen Fenech , for his involvement in planning 
the murder. In July, the report of an independent judicial inquiry  flagged the re-
sponsibility of the state for the climate of impunity that  led to Caruana Galizia’s 
killing. 
In June, Slovakia’s Supreme Court acquitted and ordered the retrial  of a man ac-
cused of being involved in the murder of journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, in 2018. In Athens, Greece, investigative journalist 
Giorgos 
Karaivaz  was shot in April 2021. The inv estigation was ongoing. In the Nether-
lands, investigative journalist Peter R. de Vries  was shot in Central Amsterdam 
on July 6 and died nine days later; tw o people were in custody for their alleged 
involvement. According to inv estigators, the murders of Karaivaz  and de Vries 
are linked to organized crime networks. 
In its  annual Rule of Law report , the European Commiss ion identified th at civil 
society org anizations face serious ch allenges in some EU state s. In Hungar y, civil 
society groups continue to face smear campaigns and laws criminalizing legiti-mate activities. In Poland , human rights def enders face harass ment and defund-
ing, with women’s human rights defenders facing 
escalating threats . France’s 
252WORLD REPORT 2022top administrative court confirmed  in September the government-ordered disso-
lution of an anti-disc rimination gro up. In Greece, Cyprus, and Italy, civil soc iety 
groups working on migration face  a hostile environment. 
Climate Change Policy and Impacts  
The 27 member states of the European Union are among the top 10 greenhouse 
gas emitters  globally, making a ma jor contribution to the c limate cr isis that is 
taking a mounting toll on human rights arou nd the globe. In July, the European 
Commission adopted a  series of legislative proposals  laying out how it intends 
to achieve  climate neutrality by 2050 , the target set in the 2020 European Cli-
mate Law adopted in June, including the intermedi ate target of an at least 55 
percent net reduction in greenhou se gas emiss ions by 20 30. According to Cli-
mate Action Tracker, the 2030 commitment is “almost sufficient” to meet the 
Paris Agreement goal to s tay below 1.5°C of warming. 
Despite committing to phase out envir onmentally harmful subsidies, including 
subsidies for fossil fuels, by 2020 , European Parliament members voted in 
2021 to prolong gas subs idies unti l 2027 , undermining em issions r eduction ef-
forts. 
Several European officials, including the French president and the then-German 
chancellor, have said they opposed or had strong reservations about the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement due to Brazil’s disregard for its commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement and failure to curb illegal deforestation in the Amazon, a “carbon sink” critical for mitigating climate change.  
Foreign Policy 
The European Comm ission c ontinued to oppose temporarily wa iving some intel-
lectual property and trade rules in the Agr eement on Trade-Related Aspects of In-
tellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) that would facilitate the world-wide production of Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines needed for the pandemic 
response. 
253HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHHungary repeatedly used the EU’s un animity rule to prevent the adoption of sev-
eral EU statements on human rights, as well as of EU foreign ministers’ conclu-
sions on China’s crackdown in Hong Kong.  
Highlighting major double-standards in foreign policy, the EU and its member 
states failed  to take decisive  action to addre ss serious h uman 
rights abuses in Egypt, the Gulf countries, Is rael and Palestine, and India. Trade, 
migration-management, and perceived geostrategic interests ostensibly took precedence over human rights concerns in EU relations with these and other countries, leading to a reluctance to publicly denounce abuses or to condition military, budgetary, or political support to states responsible for grave human right s viol ations. Similarly, the EU rai sed concerns on rule of la w and human 
rights in Turkey but failed to make it a priority in the relationship. When unanim-ity was secur ed, the EU managed to take bo ld steps, including notably on Rus-
sia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Myanmar, and Belarus. 
The EU collectively and several of its member states continued to play an impor-
tant role on several initiatives at the UN, and sponsored, co-sponsored, or sup-
ported important resolutions including on Afghanistan, Belarus, Ethiopia, Sudan, Syria, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nicaragua, 
North Korea, and climate change. But EU mem ber states’ support for joint state-
ments on Egypt and on China was fr agmented, and none supported the estab-
lishment of  a comm ission of inquiry on Israel. 
The failure to seriously address human rights violations by EU member states, 
and EU double standards continued to risk devaluing important EU declarations and human rights policies including the new 
EU Action Plan on Human Rights 
and Democracy . 
In February, the EU revised its  guidelines for human rights dialogues  with third 
countries, recognizing the need to maximize their impact. Human rights dia-logues have often been unproductive u ndertakings, often held just ahead of 
higher-level engagements by EU leaders with their counterparts, giving the ap-pearance of being no more than a box ticking exercise. 
In 
April , EU foreign ministers adopted a new  strategy  for the Sahel region, recog-
nizing the urgent need for security sector reform, improved governance, and ac-
countability, including justice for vi olations committed by the security 
254WORLD REPORT 2022forces. Concerns remain over its implementation in a changing scenario and un-
certainties over the EU’s presence in the region. 
In March, under the  new EU global human rights sanctions regime , the EU desig-
nated a total of 15 individuals and 4 entities from Russia, China, North Korea, Libya, South Sudan, and Eritrea. At the time of writing these were the only designations under the 
new EU global human rights sanctions regime . The sanc-
tions against Chinese officials deemed responsible for what Human Rights Watch and others has det ermined to be 
crimes against humanity  in Xinjiang 
were the first restrictive measures against the Chinese government since the 1990 Tiananmen massacre. Beijing retaliat ed with counters anctions agains t sev-
eral EU and European entities and Mem bers of the European Parliament; in re-
sponse, the European Parliament 
froze  any consideration of a bilateral trade 
deal with China. Existing sanctions regimes and arms embargoes were con-firmed or strengthened, including those on Myanmar, Belarus, Syria, and 
Venezuela, among others. 
In 
March , the European Parliament adopted a  legislative initiative report  paving 
the way for EU legislation on sustainable corporate governance. The proposed 
legislation  should  put in place binding pro visions for companies to conduct 
human rights and environmental due diligence throughout their value chain, foreseeing penalties in case of failure to comply and establishing legal remedies 
for affected individual s and communities. In 
September , the Comm ission’s Pres-
ident, Ursula von der Leyen, also announced upcoming legislation to ban prod-ucts produced by forced labor from entering the EU market. 
In September, the Eu ropean C ommiss ion 
proposed  a new regulation to replace 
the current Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) when it expires in 2023. The scheme provides beneficiary countries with tariff benefits for their exports to 
the EU against varying degrees of human rights conditionality. While the new proposal includes some improvements, several  human rights groups, including 
Human Rights Watch, 
urged  the European Parliament and the European Council 
to address some of the scheme’s longstanding key weaknesses. 
Current GSP beneficiaries include countrie s with very serious shortcomings in 
their human rights records, including Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, and Myanmar. In April, the EU granted GSP+ to Uzbekistan despite 
255HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHpersistent serious human rights concerns. Pressure from the  European Parlia-
ment  ahead of the EU’s assessment of Sri Lanka’s compliance with its obliga-
tions under the GSP scheme helped build momentum to secure reform of parts of the country’s abu sive counter-t errorism legi slation and responses. 
The European Parliament continued to play an important role as a watchdog of 
EU foreign policy, often denouncing abuses  committed by governments that the 
EU and its member states were unwilling to publicly criticize, including Egypt, Rwanda, India, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the Unit ed Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. 
Unfortuna tely, calls by Europe an parliamentarians  for concre te EU action often 
were ignored by the European Comm ission, the European Ext ernal Action Serv-
ice, the European Council, and EU member states. The European Parliament 
awarded  the 2 021 Sakharov Prize to  Russian diss ident 
Alexei Navalny.  
256WORLD REPORT 2022France 
Despite government measures to mitigate its economic impact, the Covid-19 
pandemic exacerbated poverty and inequality . Police targeted minority youth for 
discriminatory police identity checks. Ch ild protection authorities often failed to 
provide unaccompanied migrant children w ith appropriate care and services. Mi-
grants and asylum seekers faced inhumane living conditions and police abuse. Racist violence remained a concern. Persons with disabilities faced discrimina-tion. The forced dissolution of a leading anti-discrimination group and the in-creased use of accelerated procedures in the legislative process raise rule of law 
concerns.  
Poverty and Inequality 
According to the  National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies  and  the 
National Council for Poverty and Social Exclusion Policies , the Covid-1 9 crisis ex-
acerbated the precariousness of the poorest people, despite government sup-
port and safeguard measures. The p andemic led to more people experiencing 
food insecurity and seeking food aid, and  exacerbated domestic violence. 
According to government data , vaccination rates were lower among people in 
poverty. Although vaccination is open to all, in practice many obstacles  re-
mained for the most marginalized populations, such as far distances from health care centers or lack of access to information. 
The annual 
winter evictions moratorium , including a ban on suspending gas and  
electricity  for non- payment , was extended  by two months, to the end of May. A 
coalition of nongovernmental groups (NGOs) warned in mid-July  against an in-
crease in evictions from informal settlements since June 1. 
Migrants and Asylum Seekers  
Throughout the year, adults and children living in informal encampments in Paris  
and in and around Calais in northern France were subjected to repeated mass 
evictions , police ha rass ment, and rest rictions on hum anitarian assistanc e. The 
CNCDH denounced  in February the living conditions and rights violations of mi-
grants in northern France hoping to travel onward to the UK. Irregular boat cross-

RIGHTS   WATCH  ings in the Channel more than doubled in 2021  compared to 2020. France criti-
cized a UK plan  to push boats back as contrary to maritime law and the obliga-
tion to safeguard life at sea.  
French border police unlawfully expelled  migrants, including unaccompanied 
children , at the French-Italian border. 
In April, France deported  a Chechen who was an important witness in a torture 
case to Russia despite a decision by the n ational a sylum court proh ibiting h is ex-
pulsion; he was arbitrari ly detained by Chechen security  officials two days after 
his deportation. In a separate April case, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) 
urged  France to assess in a “complete and  precise” way the risks that a 
Chechen national would face before being deported to Russia. 
In July, the ECtHR ruled  that the 2018 detention pending deportation of a Malian 
woman and her four-month-old daughter viol ated their rights to liberty and secu-
rity and the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment. 
By the end of August, France had evacuated  2,600 Afghans from Kabul. French 
authorities opened a dedicated office to pr ocess their asylum claims, which will 
undergo expedited processing . 
Rule of Law  
In September, the Council of State, France’s highest administrative court, ap-proved the December 2020 
dissolution by decree  of the Collective against Islam-
ophobia in France (CCIF), disappointingly accepting the government’s argument that the prominent anti-discrimination group engaged in incitement to discrimi-nation, hatred, and violence. The dissolution of CCIF is part of a broader crack-down on liberties in response to 
attacks attributed to Islamist extremists . 
The CNCDH  and the European Commission  expressed concerns that the law 
“consolidating the principles of the Republic”  intended to “fight against sepa-
ratism and attacks on citizenship,” adopt ed in August, might violate fundamen-
tal rights, including freedom of association, information, and education. 
In March, the French defender of rights warned  against the proliferation of laws 
in response to Covid-19 that the pandemic did  not always justify, and the multi-
plication of norms regulating individual freedoms without judicial control. In its 
259HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHJuly report on Eur opean rule of law, the Eur opean C ommiss ion noted  that the use 
of accelerated procedu res, including for laws with a significant impact on indi-
vidual freedoms, has bec ome the norm and denounc ed the shrinking space for 
civil soc iety. 
A new security law enacted in May prompted concerns  over its potential impact 
on freedom of expression and information, and on the right to protest. 
The state of health emergency introduced in March 2020 in response to Covid-19 
was successively ex tended during the yea r. Concerns were ra ised about the risks 
to individual liberties under the st ate of emergency. The defender of rights 
pointed to the potential for discrimin ation, violations of children’s rights, the 
risks to vulnerable populations, and data protection in relation to the creation of an obligatory he alth p ass in August. 
Law Enforcement and Police Abuse 
In July, six civil soc iety groups including Human Rights Watch  filed an unprece-
dented case  before the Council of State over systemic racial discrimination by 
the police with res pect to unlawful ethnic profiling during identity checks. 
In April, Reporters Without Bor ders (RSF) warned against police attacks on journ-
liasts covering protests . Similarly, in its July rule of law report , the European 
Commission noted attacks on journalist s and media workers, both by protestors 
and police, despite France’s solid legal framework to ensure media pluralism and independence.  
In May, the Constitutional Council 
declared unconstitutional  some pro visions in-
cluded in a “global security law,” in particular one that would have made it an offense to disseminate images of law enforcement officers in the exercise of 
their duties. 
Children’s Rights  
The French defender of rights raised concerns  about the placement of unaccom-
panied children in closed reception facilities, in some departments across 
France, and called on authorities to hou se children in adequate and dignified fa-
cilities. 
260WORLD REPORT 2022At time of writing, a draft law on child protection that would prohibit the place-
ment of unaccompanied children in hotel s, where they face overcrowding, isola-
tion, weak surveill ance, and prox imity to plac es of traffic king, was pending 
before the Senate. NGOs have critic ized some provis ions as contrary to the best 
interest of the child, including the impos ition of biometric registration of unac-
companied children. 
By September, France had relocated  379 unaccompanied children and 366 other 
asylum seekers deemed vulnerable from Greece. 
The National Assembly adopted a law in April defining as rape any act of sexual 
penetration between an adult and a child under the age of 15, punishable by up to 20 years in jail, without having to prove coercion. 
In a February 
report , the controller general of places of deprivation of liberty ex-
pressed concerns about the increase in detention of children, the frequent fail-
ure to strictly separate children and adults  in prisons and in police custody cells, 
and the lack of access of children deprived of their liberty to education and men-tal and physical care.  
Discrimination and Intolerance 
According to official data published  in July, overall bias crimes decreased by 26 
percent in 2020 compared to 2019 but anti-Muslim acts increased by 52 percent. 
The interior ministry registered 5,086 victims of offenses due to ethnicity, nation-ality, religion, or race in 2020, a 5 percent decrease compared to 2019. Accord-
ing to the same report, Roma and Travellers continued to be stigmatized, with polls compiled by the CNCDH showing that 75 percent of respondents consider Roma people as a “separate group” in society. 
In a July 
report , the CNCDH suggested that, whi le there had been fewer serious 
bias acts during Covid-19 lockdowns, ther e had been an increase in online hate 
speech. 
A law on bioethics allowing fertility trea tments for lesbian couples and single 
women was adopted in August. Transgender people continued to be legally  ex-
cluded from these treatments. 
261HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn a May report , the nongovernmental group SOS Homop hobie concluded that vi-
olence targeting lesbian, gay, bisex ual and transgender (LGBT) people, particu-
larly youth, by their families and their communities increased during the pandemic as measures to try to prevent the spread of Covid-19 were enforced. 
Women’s Rights 
The National Assembly voted to ratify  the Violence and  Harass ment at Work Con-
vention of the Int ernational  Labour Org anization (ILO) in July; it  was voted  by the 
Senate in October. France’s minister of labor said  that the current legal frame-
work is sufficient to address sexual harass ment at work, but f eminist grou ps and 
labor unions argue  further reform  is necessary, in accordance with the conven-
tion and its standards. 
In September, the government announced  that free contraception, previously 
available only to girls under 18, would be extended to women up to the age 25, beginning in 2022. 
In August, France’s interior minister 
announced  a series of measures to address 
domestic violence, including the appointment of officers specializing in domes-
tic violence to each police station and  each gendarmerie brigade across France. 
He noted that domestic violence “is becoming the primary reason for police and 
gendarme intervention,” with 400,000 police interventions in 2020. France’s 
femicide  rate remains among the highest in Europe, and failures by police  in 
high-profile cases led to protests and  calls for improvements in authorities’ re-
sponse to violence against women. 
A study  commissioned by the European Parliament found that female employ-
ment was dispr oportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  
Disability Rights 
In its September concluding observations , the UN Committee on the Rights of 
People with Disabilities expressed concerns about discrimination; limited imple-
mentation of accessibility in public services and facilities; deprivation of legal capacity and  the lack of suppor ted decision-making; depriv ation of liber ty on 
262WORLD REPORT 2022grounds of disability; the high number of children with disabi lities in segregated 
education settings; and barriers in access to justice. 
It also criticized inhuman and degrading conditions, including violence, humilia-
tion and sexual abuse in residential and mental health facilities, forced psychi-atric treatment, and the use of so litary confinement, seclusion, chemical and 
physical restraints, including on children. 
The committee also noted the la ck of a disa bility-inclu sive res ponse to the dis-
proportionate impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on persons with disabilities. 
Among other things, it called on the gov ernment to initiate emergency deinstitu-
tionalization and ensure safe and independent living in the community and to actively consult with people with disabi lities and their representative organiza-
tions in pub lic decis ion-making. 
Counterterrorism 
Several civil soc iety or ganizations  criticized a counterterrorism law, adopted in 
July, for permanently renewing emergency measures adopted in 2015 and 2017 
and giving  intelligence services new powers of mass surveillance , including the 
possibility of using algorithms to scan internet connections and browsing data, and the interception of satellite communications. The law also empowers the government to close places of worship where terrorism, hatred, or discrimination 
is promoted, as well as spaces affiliated  with these places of worship. 
The trial

lamic State (ISIS), charged with involv ement in the November 2015 Paris attacks, 
which killed 130 people and  injured hundreds more.  
Climate Change Policy and Impacts 
As one of the EU’s biggest gr eenhouse gas emitters , France is contributing to the 
climate cr isis tak ing a growing to ll on human rights arou nd the glo be. France 
committed  to reducing em issions by 40 percent by 2030. From January 2020 
through March 3, 43 percent of the almost US$57 billion  Covid-19 recovery were 
subsidies for fossil fuels. In a February report , the High Council for the Climate  
said that, while progre ss has been made, the gov ernment’s effor ts remain too 
263HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHslow to achieve the 2030 ta rget. France has already w armed by 1. 7 degrees and 
severe climate impacts such as heat waves and forest fires will become more fre-quent and intense. 
In February, the Paris Administrative Court 
held  in a landmark ruling that climate 
change constitu tes environment al damage to which state in action has con-
tributed. In October, the court issued an additional ruling  in this case finding 
that Franc e has to make  up for its past  failures and achiev e additional emission 
reductions by December 2022. In June, the Sen ate adopted the “climate and re-
silience” law. Despite some pos itive measures, it has been severely c riticized  for 
its lack of ambition. In July, the Council of State ordered  the government to take 
additional measures by March 2022 to put France on track to meet its commit-ment to reduce gr eenhouse gas emiss ions. 
Despite 
poor implementation  by the gov ernment, civil society  groups are in-
creasingly using the French Duty of Vigilance Law  to hold private actors to ac-
count for harming the c limate. In F ebruary, the Nanterr e civil court held  that it 
had jurisdiction over a case against Total, an energy company, claiming it had not taken adequate measures to prevent human rights, health, and environmen-tal damage resulting from its contribution to climate change. 
Foreign Policy 
France continued to support scrutiny under Article 7 —the European Union 
mechanism to deal with EU members putting the union’s values at risk —to ad-
dress rule of law concerns in Hungary and Poland. The European Affairs Minis-ter 
claimed  he was denied acce ss to an “LGBT-free” zone by Polish authorities 
during an official visit in March. In June, he called  the anti-LGBT law adopted in 
Hungary “a scandal.”  
In February, France condemned  the jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexei 
Navalny, supported EU sanctions against Russia and stated  that President 
Putin and Russian authorities would be held responsible and face further sanctions if Navalny died.
 
In May, France condemned  the unlawful fo rced landing of a Ryan air flight  by 
the Belarus authorities, calling it an “act of state piracy,” and the consequent 
264WORLD REPORT 2022arbitrary  arrest of a pr ominent blogger and  political act ivist and his partner, 
and called for “a strong and united response from the EU.”  
Although France signed on to a  joint declaration  at the UN Human Rights Council 
condemning the human rights situation in Egypt in March, in May it announced a deal, financed through French loans, for the sale of 30 Rafale fighter jets to 
Egypt. A few months before, President 
Emmanuel M acron  said  he would not 
make the sale of weapons to Egypt conditional on human rights. 
Despite mounting evidence of war crimes by the Saudi and UAE-led coalition in 
Yemen and lack of acco untability for the se crimes, Saudi Arabia was France’s 
biggest arms buyer  in 2020 . In December, France concluded  with the UAE what 
the government characterized as its largest arms contract ever, totaling US$19 billion, including the sale of 80 Rafale fighter jets.   
In May, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian 
warned  of “a risk of 
apartheid” in Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, noting that “even the status quo produces this.” France, though, abstained at the Human Rights Council on a 
resolution  that established a commission of inquiry into violations in Israel 
and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).  
In August, France announced  €100 million in humanitarian aid for the 
Lebanese people during a donor s’ conference it co-sponsored with the UN, but 
has not  yet supporte d calls from victims and  civil society f or an intern ational 
independent inv estigation into the Beirut blast. 
In May, in Kigali, Macron said  he recognized France’s “responsibilities” in the 
genocide in Rwanda and hoped for forgiv eness, while indicating that “France 
was not c omplicit” in the massacre s. In March, a report  commissioned by 
Macron concluded that France had “heavy and overwhelming responsibilities” in the 1994 genocide. 
 
In February, the foreign minister denounced  “institutionalized repression” of 
Uyghurs by China’s authorities and called  for an impartial, independent mis-
sion to Xinjiang under the auspices of the UN High Comm issioner for Human 
Rights. In October, France led a cross-regional joint statement  at the UN Gen-
eral Assembly’s Third Committee condemning the Chinese government’s wide-spread violations in Xinjiang.  
265HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFrance failed to show leadership  in pushing for sanctions on Myanmar’s oil and 
gas revenue s. Like the US and the UK, it also failed  to push for a global arms 
embargo at the UN Security Council in response to the February 1 military coup in Myanmar and the junta’s atrocities.
 
266WORLD REPORT 2022Georgia 
Setbacks in several  areas of hum an rights occurr ed during 2021  against the 
backdrop of a dramatic political standoff between the ru ling Georgian Dream 
(GD) and opposition parties that dominat ed much of the year in Georgia. 
Lack of accountability f or law enforcement abuses persisted.  Other ar eas of con-
cern included police interfe rence in freedom of assembly, attacks against jour-
nalists and declining media freedom, instit utionalization of children, violence 
against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and threats to 
labor safety.  
In August, the European Union said Georgia fa iled to qualify for a €75 million 
(around US$86 million) in assistanc e conditioned on judic ial reforms.  
Municipal Elections 
After the October 2020 general elections, oppo sition parties boycotted their 
seats in parliament, alleging electoral fraud . In April, the EU mediated an agree-
ment between the GD and opposition parties that ended the boycott, envisaged 
electoral and judicial reforms, and propo sed early parliamentary elections if GD 
failed to garner 43 percent of votes in October 2021 municipal elections. This prompted the opposition to frame munic ipal elections as a “referendum” on 
holding snap parliamentary elections. GD ab andoned the agreement in July, cit-
ing the refusal by the main opposition party, United National Movement (UNM) to sign it and ruling out snap polls. 
GD won a significant majority in the municipal elections in October. The opposi-
tion rejected the results and ca lled for street protests. 
International observers, led by the Org anization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe (OSCE), found that the elections were competitive and “technically well-administered,” but “marred by allegations of pressure on voters, vote-buying and an unlevel playing field.” Following the run-offs later in October, they also said that “sharp imbalances in resources, and an undue advantage of incum-bency further benefited the ruling party and tilted the playing field.” 
267HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn October 1, a day before the polls, police detained ex-President Mikheil 
Saakashvili after his retu rn to Georgia fol lowing an eigh t-year absence. In 2018, 
a court convicted him in absentia on two counts of abuse of office and sen-tenced him to six years. The Interior Ministry  launched an investigation into ille-
gal border crossing in addition to two other pending charges. Saakashvili denied 
all charges and said they were politically motivated.  
Lack of Accountability for Law Enforcement Abuses  
Impunity for abuses by law enforcement  remained a persistent problem. By Sep-
tember 2021, the Ombudswoman’s Office received 133 complaints of ill-treat-ment by prison staff or police and petitioned the State Inspector’s Office, an independent body investigating abuses by law enforcement, to launch investiga-
tions in all cases. At time of writing, the investigations were ongoing.  
Police interfered with the right to freedom of assembly by preventing protesters 
from installing tents outside the parliament building in Tbilisi. In February, police 
arrested over 20 protesters on misdemeanor disobedience charges after law en-forcement officers seized a tent, which led to skirmishes with the gathered ac-tivis ts. 
On February 23, police stormed UNM’s headquarters to detain its leader, Nika 
Melia, over his failure to pay additional bail fees. Police used teargas, detained 21 people on disobedience charges, and seiz ed computer serve rs. The Georgian 
Young Lawyers’ Association (GYLA), a leading nongovernmental group, said that 
the use of te ar gas was dispr oportionate and  criticiz ed the police for failing to ex-
plain the grounds for seizing the computer hardware. Melia continued to face 
charges for inciting violence during 2019 protests in Tbilisi and refusing to pay increased bail after he discarded an ankle monitor during November 2020 rally. 
GYLA also criticized the police use of  misdemeanor disobedience charges to de-
tain people protesting the raid as a means “to suppress peaceful protests.”  
In April, the parliament rushed amendments to the code of administrative of-
fenses, toughening penalties f or petty hooliganism and police disobedience. 
The amendments doubled or tripled fines (up to approximately US$1,300), in-
creased administrative detention from 7 to 15 days, and stripped the judicial dis-cretion for more lenient sanctions for r epeat offenders. Georgian human rights 
268WORLD REPORT 2022groups criticized the amendments as making “r oom for arbitrary use of repres-
sive police mechanisms and sanctions.” They emp hasized that co urt rulings on 
administrative offenses are often based solely on the testimonies of police offi-
cers and disregard fair trial norms. 
In September, an anonymous source claiming to have worked for the state intel-
ligence agency, leaked thousands of documents to media containing compro-
mising information on Georgian cler gy, including information on their intimate 
relationships, sexual orientation, or illegal drug use. The documents were gath-ered allegedly through illegal surveill ance and wiretapping, The files also in-
cluded conver sations of Geor gian journali sts, opposition po liticians, civil 
servants, and foreign diplomats. The prosecut or’s office launched an investiga-
tion into the leak.  
Freedom of Media  
Journalists and other media professional s endured numerous threats and at-
tacks throughout 2021. In February, po lice arrested three people for assaulting 
Vakho Sanaia, an independent Formula TV anchor in Tbilisi. Sanaia said the as-sailants recognized him and shouted insults at him during the attack. In August, a court convicted the assailants and sentenced them to time served on remand.  
On July 5, amid homophobic violence against a planned Pride March, hate 
groups verbally and physically assaulted  at least 53 media workers in Tbilisi, in-
cluding journali sts and cameramen fr om televis ion channels TV Pir veli, Formula 
TV, Mtavari Arkhi, Rustavi 2, Imedi TV, Public Broadcaster, Radio Liberty’s Geor-gia service, and several online media outlets. The attackers smashed and de-stroyed media equipment. Several journalists sustained physical injuries and required brief hospitalization.  
Police appeared to be present but fai led to prevent the violent incidents. (See 
below). 
TV Pirveli cameramen Alexandre Lashkarava, who sustained facial bone frac-
tures, a concussion, and contus ions, and underw ent surgery,  was found dead in 
his apartment two days la ter. The day after Lshkarav a was found, before the 
cause of de ath was fully est ablished, the authoritie s publicly al leged he had 
died from a drug overdose, based on what they called “interim forensic results” 
269HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHof a blood test. No final forensic results have been issued at time of writing. 
Lashkarava’s family and civil society groups  questioned the r ushed findings. Po-
lice launched an investigation into incitement to suicide. 
On July 22, the culture minister grabbed and confiscated the microphone from a 
journalist with the pro-oppos ition tele vision ch annel, Mtavari Ark hi, in response 
to uncomfortable questions.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Organizers of Tbilisi Pride had to cancel the planned march on July 5 after far-right groups stormed their headquarters and attacked journalists. Mobs climbed 
onto the balcony of the Tbilisi Pride headquarters, broke windows, tore a rain-bow flag, and ransacked the offices. They also attacked and injured over 50 jour-
nalists (see above) and broke into the offices of several nongovernmental groups that hid Pride organizers as violent mobs chased them throughout the city.  
Instead of ensuring the safety and fr eedom of assembly of the Pride organizers 
and participants, the authorities appeared to blame them. Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili s aid that  it was “unreason able” to hold the demonstration in a pub-
lic place th at could lead to “civil c onfrontation.” The Interior Ministry also 
warned against holding such marches in a public space. According to numerous media reports, police were present in small numbers and failed to effectively in-
tervene. In the aftermath of the violent spr ee, police launched investigation and 
arrested at least 27 people for par ticipating in organized violence. The om-
budswoman criticized the authorities for fai ling to prosecute any of the organiz-
ers of the violence. 
In March, authorities allowed the first-ever legal gender recognition for a trans-
gender person, changing the gender marker from “male” to “female,” but only after she provided a medical certificat e proving she had undergone surgery. 
Medical certification is required for transgender people to obtain legal gender recognition in Georgia. This represents a seriou s obstacle in the daily lives of 
transgender people, encouraging their marginalization, and raising unemploy-ment and poverty risks.  
270WORLD REPORT 2022Children’s Rights  
In May, a foster care home in Ninotsminda f or 56 children, including eight with 
disabilities, run by the Georgian Orthod ox Church, drew media attention after 
the office of the ombuds woman was twice denied a monit oring visit, prompting 
the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to issue an emergency temporary measure. The measure called on the authorities to immediately ensure state 
monitoring.  
The ombudswoman publicized information about four ongoing criminal investi-
gations related to physical and sex ual abuse against children in the Ninots-
minda institution. After a public outcry, in June, a court ruled to remove children 
with disabilities from the instit ution. State social workers facilitated the transfer 
of over 30 children, including children w ithout disabilities. Over a dozen chil-
dren remained there under close state scrutin y. The church also replaced the es-
tablishment’s director. The new director claimed  to have dismissed over two 
dozen staff and expressed readiness to cooperate with the office of the om-budswoman.  
In July, UNICEF hosted a two-day works hop with Georgian officials and all part-
ners working on children’s  rights to assist the government  in develop ing an ac-
tion plan for deinstitutionalization for chi ldren with and without disabilities 
residing in state and private institutions.  
In July, a court ruled that forcibly sep arating children from fami lies due to poverty 
is illegal. It ordered the government to pay GEL35,000 (US$11,000) in damages to each of three children who had been forcibly separated from their mothers 
two years earlier due to poverty, without the state first attempting to provide support to the family.  
Schools were closed for 155 days, and partially closed to certain ages or in cer-
tain areas, for another 84 days since the pandemic’s start in 2020. UNICEF esti-mated that at least 50,000 children lost access to education when Georgia switched to online schooling. Many students  faced barriers to accessing remote 
education, primarily due to limited internet  access in mountainous regions, the 
lack of suitable electronic devices among f amilies living in poverty, and the lack 
of teachers’ experience with online education. 
271HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHLabor Rights 
Sweeping labor reforms came into eff ect on January 1, 2021, expanding the 
Labor Inspectorate’s m andate to monitor all labor standards and introducing 
new regulations for work hou rs, overtime, and time off.  
Despite these reforms, fair labor conditions remain a persistent concern. Social 
protections are minimal, unions lack legal  guarantees that would allow them to 
effectively bargain for systemic change s, and the Labor Inspectorate’s effective-
ness has been hampered by a short age of resourc es. A June r eport by the inde-
pendent trade union Solidarity Network found that nurses earn less than a living wage.  
Workplace safety also remains a per sistent problem. According to the Labor In-
spectorate, 20 workers died and 189 were injured in work-related accidents from 
January through September. App-based food  delivery services, which boomed 
during the Covid-19 pandemic, emerged as a new battleground for workplace 
safety. In early 2021, more than 100 delivery couriers turned off their apps to protest unrealistic performance ta rgets, which they said made their jobs more 
dangerous. 
Key International Actors  
The EU, US, and Georgia’s other Western partners engaged throughout the year 
to assist in resolving the po litical crisi s. European Counci l President  Charles 
Michel mandated a Swedish  diplomat, Christian D anielsson, to broker mediation 
efforts. (See above). 
In February, the EU released its Association Implementation report, highlighting 
that Georgia broadly continued alignment to  European standards, but noted 
challenges regarding the independence of the judiciary and the need for further electoral reforms. 
In March, the EU-Georgia Association Co uncil assessed the implementation of 
the Association Agreement. The EU urged Georgia to further implement the anti-
discrimination law, ensure protection for minority groups, and safeguard gender 
equality. It also urged Georgia to continue effor ts to create an effective labor in-
spectorate “to further improve working conditions.” During their human rights 
272WORLD REPORT 2022dialogue in July, the EU and Georgia c ondemned the violent attacks leading to 
the cancellation of the Pride march, and Georgi a committed to investigate such 
attacks.  
In February, following opposition leader Ni ka Melia’s detention, the US embassy 
expressed regret that the authorities ignored  international partners’ call for re-
straint and dialogue and the EU stated th at the political polarization following 
his arrest undermines Georgia’s democracy. 
In January, the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling in the inter-state 
complaint lodged by Georgia finding Russia’s conduct in the aftermath of the 2008 war breached six articles of the European Convention of Human Rights. 
(See Russia chapter). 
The International Criminal Court continued its investigation into war crimes and 
crimes against humanity committed during the August 2008 Russia-Georgia war 
over South Ossetia.  
273HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHGermany 
Right-wing extremism, antisemitism, and racism appeared to be on the rise. 
Media freedom, which det eriorated du ring the Covid-19 p andemic, was fur ther 
affected by new surveillance laws. Follow ing the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan, 
Germany halted repatriations of Afghans, bu t largely failed to evacuate at-risk 
Afghans in time. A new law obligates la rge companies to address human rights 
risks in their direct supply chains. German y apologized for the 1904-1908 geno-
cide in Namibia. 
Discrimination and Intolerance  
Official statistics  published in May showed an increase in politically motivated 
crimes in 2020, particularly hate crimes carried out by right-wing extremists . 
Anti-immigrant and antisemitic crimes increased by 72 and almost 16 percent, respectively, over the previous year.
 In August, Germany’s Federal Anti-Discrimi-
nation Agency published figures showing a 78 percent increase in calls reporting a racist incident in 2020.  
Tareq Alaows , a Syrian hum an rights act ivist and the first refugee in Germany to 
run for parliament, withdrew in March citing racist attacks and personal threats. 
There were sever al high-profile criminal  cases. In Januar y, a Neo-Nazi was sen-
tenced  to life in prison for fatally s hooting pro-refugee politici an Walter Lübcke 
in 2019.  
In May, a German army officer  with alleged  right-wing affinitie s was put on trial 
for planning to murder at least one politician in 2017 using the fake identity of a Syrian asylum seeker to provoke anti-migrant sentiment.  
Germany’s domestic intelligence agency pu t the Alternative für Deutschland 
(AfD) party under 
formal surveillance  for potential extr emist links in February 
2021. The agency’s chief identified far-right extremism as the biggest threat to democracy in Germany. 
Authorities took steps against far-right infil tration in security forces. A special 
police unit in Frankfurt was 
disbanded  after an investigation found in June 2021 
that some of its officers had been involved in far-right extremist chat groups. 
274WORLD REPORT 2022In February, illeg al weapons, ammu nition, and explo sives were  found in a house 
of a soldier  from an elite army unit, commando special forces  (KSK), prompting 
the Defense Ministry to suggest a change in the law for quicker dismissal of sol-diers in the event of serious offenses. The def ense minister had dissolved part of 
the controversial KSK unit in 2020 over right-wing extremism in its ranks. 
In June, Germany decided to 
repatriate  a Bundeswehr army platoon stationed in 
Lithuania due to concerns of antisemitism and right-wing extremism. 
German President Steinmeier condemned  an increase in attacks  on Jewish insti-
tutions in German cities following the escalation in conflict between Israel and Palestine in May. 
An April 
report  commissioned by the European Comm ission found a consider-
able increase in online antisemitic hate speech during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 
the first two months of 2021 alone, the study recorded a thirteen-fold increase in antisemitic comments in German compared to the same period in 2020. 
The June 
report  by an independent comm ission set up  by the German Bundestag  
in 2019 found that the effects of the Nazi genocide and the failure to counter anti-Roma racism are still evident today with discrimination in public spheres in-cluding education, social services, and policing. 
A new law  entered into force in September 2021 making private hate-motivated 
insults a criminal offense punishable as incitement to racial hatred. 
Parliament rejected bills  to reform the onerous pr ocedure for transgender people 
to modify their registered name and gender. 
For the first time, people with disabilities who had previously been denied the right to vote due to court-imposed restrictions on their rights voted in the Sep-tember federal elections, as per a 2019 Constitutional Court ruling  finding their 
exclusion from voting unconstitutional.  
International Justice  
In the first known trial  dealing with state-sponsored torture in Syria, and making 
use of Germany’s universal jurisdiction laws, a Koblenz court sentenced  in Feb-
ruary 2021 a former Syrian intelligence officer to four-and-a-half years in prison 
275HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHfor his role in the torture of protesto rs in Syria in 2011. A verdict in the ongoing 
trial of a second defendant, also an alleged former Syrian intelligence officer 
charged w ith crimes against hum anity, was expected by the end of 2021. 
Progress was also m ade in other cases brought  under German y’s univers al juris-
diction laws. In March, German authorities arrested a former Gambian “death 
squad” member  suspected of crimes against humanity in the 2000s. In July, Ger-
man prosecutors filed torture and murder charges  against a suspected Syrian 
military intelligence agent accused of torturing an inmate in a prison where he 
worked as a doctor.  
In August, another Sy rian m an was arrested  in Berlin on war crime charges for fir-
ing a tank grenade into a crowd of people awaiting food distribution in Damas-cus in 2014, killing at least seven.  
Using Germany’s universal jurisdiction laws, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) 
filed a 
lawsuit  in March with a German pro secutor against Saudi Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman and his aides for the murder of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi. RSF claims that the killing constitutes a crime against humanity and that Saudi officials are responsible for “widespread and systematic” persecution of journalists in the kingdom. At time of writing, the prosecutor had not decided whether to open an investigation.  
In May, Germany acknowledged and apologiz ed for the 1904-1908 genocide in 
today’s Namibia, where the German colonial  government killed 80,000 Herero 
and Nama people. Some 
groups  argued that Herero and Nama people were not 
consulted enough in the negotiation and that US$1.34 billion that Germany com-mitted for social projects in Namibia is not same as paying reparations directly to the families. 
Business and Human Rights  
In January, a new law entered into force granting better protections to foreign 
workers in the meat processing industry . The law was adopted after Co vid-19 out-
breaks in meat processing plants in 2020 exposed horrific working conditions in 
the industry. 
276WORLD REPORT 2022In June, parliament adopted a new law on supply chains  requiring large compa-
nies to identify and address human rights and environmental risks in their direct 
supply chains. Though a step forward,  the law does not incorporate the highest 
international standards .  
Also in June, the Federation of German Industries  urged local companies to mon-
itor for forced labor when doing business with companies in the Chinese region 
of Xinjiang, where about one million Turkic Muslims have been detained in “po-litical reeducation” labor camps. 
Migrants and Asylum Seekers  
In the first eight months of 2021, 85,230 people  applied for asylum  in Germany, 
an increase of 33.2 percent compared to the same period last year. Most appli-
cants came from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. By the end of August, 75,579 appli-cations were pending. 
Undocumented migrants in Germany had 
difficulties  accessing Covid vaccines 
according to Doctors of the World Germany bec ause of a lack of a national plan. 
Federal states  applied different rule s in some cases creating risk of deportation 
for undocumented people becau se of a lack of a firewall between social welfare 
and healthcare services and law enforcement. 
In April, Germany ended the program, set up in 2020 , to relocate asylum seekers 
from Greek islands through which more than 2,700 people were transferred to 
Germany. 
A Berlin court ruled  in June that Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and 
Refugees (BAMF) had violated the rights of an asylum seeker by demanding ac-cess to her cell phone data early in her application and unnecessarily storing the information obtained during the search. The ru ling could set a precedent for sim-
ilar cases pending in German courts and have an important impact on efforts to abolish the problematic 2017 law that permits authorities to analyze asylum seekers’ phone data.  
In July, a court in North Rhine-Westphalia 
ruled  that Germany should take re-
sponsibility for the asylum applications of two men even though they had first 
277HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHentered the European Union via Italy because they could face inhumane and de-
grading treatment if returned to Italy under EU rules.  
The Federal Ministry of the Interior reported  one attack per week on centers 
housing asylum seekers and refugees in the fi rst half of 2021. While fewer than 
in the previous year, the attac ks were more violent.  
After initially signing a letter  with five other EU member states in early August ar-
guing that forced returns to Afghanistan should continue, Germany suspended repatriations of Afghan migrants following the Taliban takeover in that country.  
Surveillance and Freedom of Media  
In June, parliament adopted  a law allowing federal police and intelligence serv-
ices to use spyware to hack devices and access encrypted data, raising privacy concerns.  
In May, parliament 
amended  the controversial Network Search Act (NetzDG) to 
better counter hate speech online but the amendments still fail to address con-
cerns regarding the impact of the law on freedom of expression . 
In 2021, Germany fell two points in the Reporters Without Border’s ranking of 
press freedom. The organization recorded att acks on journalists by protesters 
during protests against Covid-19 restrictions—including in Stuttgart  and Kassel , 
and a brutal attack on the manager of the journalists’ union DJU during the protest in 
Berlin —and cited a climate of mistr ust fomented by populist politicians.  
Women’s Rights  
According to a May report  commissioned by the European Parliament, the Covid-
19 crisis could exac erbate already -exis ting gender inequalities in Germany be-
cause women engage more than men in unpaid  care, are over-represented in 
part-time work, and experience l ower salaries, inc reasing the likelihood  of fe-
male poverty. 
In May, a court fined a gynecologist €3,000 ($3,650) for providing  factual infor-
mation on his abortion services on his website under a law that criminalizes “ad-vertising abortion.” 
278WORLD REPORT 2022Climate Change Policy and Impacts  
As the EU’s biggest gr eenhouse gas emitter , Germany is contributing to the cli-
mate crisis which is taking a growing toll on human rights arou nd the globe. 
In 2021, the constitutional court held that the 2019 climate change law does not adequately regulate emission r eductions and violates the go vernment’s obliga-
tion to protect rights. Since the ruling, the government pledged to reduce emis-
sions by 65 percent by 2030 compared to  1990 levels and reach net zero by 
2045. According to the 
Climate Action Tracker , this commitment is not sufficient 
to meet the Paris Agreement goal to stay below 1.5°C of warming, necessary to limit the most catastrophic climate outcomes. 
Continued government support for fossil fuels will make it difficult to meet these 
new targets. From January 2020 through March 3, 2021, 
38 percent of the almost 
$70 billion  Covid-19 recovery were subsidie s for fossil fuels. Germany is still 
among the world’s top 10 coal producers  and has only committed to a phase out 
by 2038. 
Germany is ex periencing incr easingly  frequent and extreme heat events that 
threaten human health . Record-breaking floods linked to climate change in July 
resulted in the deaths of  at least 189 people, including 12 people with disabili-
ties living in a group home .  
Foreign Policy  
In its Action Plan for Human Rights 2021/22, the German government pledged to mainstream human rights in all its policy areas. Germany’s for eign policy should 
be measured against this principle. 
Germany stepped up its engagement at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, 
leading or supporting action on countries such as Belarus, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Russia—except for Israel  where Germany with other Western states 
opposed  a commission of inquiry in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Is-
rael. The German gov ernment was also a driving force on sev eral thematic issues 
in the council, such as the right to privacy in a digital age and climate change and environmental issues. 
279HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn March, the German government pledged  to do more to uphold the rights of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people abroad through 
its Inclusion Strategy , a multifaceted scheme for foreign policy and development 
cooperation.  
Within the EU, Germany strongly condemned  legislation against the rights of 
LGBT people in Hungary and discrimination against LGBT people in Poland. It also supported continued scrutiny under Article 7—the EU mechanism to deal with EU governments putting the union’s values at risk—to address rule of law 
concerns in both countries.to address rule of law concerns in both countries. 
On China, Germany was amongst the few states willing to use diver se oppor tuni-
ties at the United Nations to call out the country for human rights violations. In New York, it played a central role in organizing a high-level virtual event on Xin-jiang in May 2021. Outside the UN, however, German policy supporting human rights in China appeared compromised, particularly in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s strong support for an EU-China investment deal ignoring the problem of forced labor in Xinjiang. 
Germany was a str ong supporter of h uman rights defender s and critics in Russia 
and Belarus. Chancellor Merkel continued to stand up for the imprisoned Russ-ian opposition politician Alex ej Navalny. The Foreign Ministry launched an action 
plan for civil society in Bel arus including supporting acce ss to humanitarian 
visas for government critics and the documentation of abuses in the country.  
In Afghanistan, Germany widely ignored the needs of human rights defenders, 
journalists, and local employees to leave the country ahead of the withdrawal of international troops. Shifting responsibi lities between government authorities, 
lack of attention, and wrong assessments pu t many Afghans at risk. While the 
German government pledged to evacuate local staff after the Taliban took over, it 
avoided any general commitment for the resettlement of Afghan refugees. 
While being a strong voice in the fight against impunity in the international 
arena, Germany’s engagement in specific co untries could have been more ac-
tive. In Libya, the Foreign Office continued  its important mediation efforts for a 
political settlement but could have done more to publicly address widespread impunity; in Sudan, much needed support for economic development and politi-
cal cooperation trumped a stronger focus on accountability.  
280WORLD REPORT 2022In the international effort to curb Covid-19, Germany strongly supported the in-
ternational vaccine platform COVAX, and p ledged to donate millions of vaccine 
doses; they also pledged to  donate other diagnostic tools and medicine world-
wide and provided funds for vaccine production in the Global South . Yet, the 
German gov ernment was one of the main opponents of waiving some  intellec-
tual property and trade rules to s peed up the production of Covid-19 vaccines 
and other health products. 
The Human Rights Committee in Parliament scrutinized the German govern-
ment’s human rights performance and prominently raised human rights viola-tions in Xinji ang, China. The Hum an Rights Comm issioner was an important 
voice for civil society  and hum an rights defender s worldwide. 
281HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHGreece 
Greece hosts large numbers of asylu m seekers while failing to protect their 
rights, including by pushing new arrivals back to Turkey. Migrant children face homelessness and lack of access to adequate healthcare and education. Victims of hate crimes are reluctant to repor t attacks to the police. Authorities failed to 
address rising violence against women and instituted measures that could 
heighten ris ks for some domestic vi olence sur vivors. Curbs on civil society 
groups assis ting migrants and  interference with independent  media raised con-
cerns about the state of rule of law in the country. 
Migrants and Asylum Seekers  
The government c ontinued its he avy-handed and  often a busive immigration con-
trols. There was a mounting chorus of c riticis m of Greece’s  practice of summarily 
returning thousands of people to Turkey , including through violent pushbacks.  
In April, the Greek ombudsman released an interim report  as part of an investi-
gation launched in 2017 , criticizing authorities for failing to adequately respond 
to multiple allegations of pushbacks at the Greek-Turkish land border. In May, Council of Europe (C oE) Comm issioner for Human Rights Dunj a Mijatović 
urged  
authorities to end pushbacks at both the land and sea borders with Turkey, and to ensure independent and  effective  investig ations. In July, EU Commiss ioner for 
Home Affairs Yilva Johansson 
warned  Greece to end pushbacks, describing them 
as “violations of our fundamental European values.”  
Greek officials deny the allegations, and authorities regularly fail  to carry-out 
proper investigations into pushbacks. The media reported  in September that the 
European Commiss ion asked Greece to set up an independent mechanism to 
monitor abuses at borders before it r eleases €15.83 million (around $18 million) 
in EU migration funding. 
In May, the office of Greece’s Supreme Court prosecutor transmitted  a criminal 
complaint concerning 147 pushbacks between March and December 2020, filed by Helsinki Monitor, to 16 first instance p rosecutors across Gr eece for investiga-
tions. Several other 
complaints  regarding pushbacks and violations by Greece 
border forces are pending before the European Court of Human Rights. 
282WORLD REPORT 2022In June, Greece expanded  the use of inadmissibility procedures on the b asis that 
Turkey is a “safe third country” to asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Somalia, 
Pakistan, and Bangladesh threatening to  leave thousands of people in limbo, 
denied protection in the EU, and unable to return to Turkey as the country has not accepted returns from Greece sinc e March 2020. These nationals represent 
more than 65 percent of asylum seekers in the country. Syrians have been sub-ject to the same rules since 2016.  
Nongovernmental groups (NGOs) 
said in July  the new rules had already resulted 
in people being denied protection within days of  their arrival, following perfunc-
tory asylum interviews, without leg al representation. More than 2,800 people 
were denied protection  on that b asis in 2020. On August  25, an appe als commit-
tee rejected the return  of an Afghan family which had been refused asylum, rul-
ing that Turkey could not be considered a safe third country for them. In June, Commissioner Johansson 
urged  the Greek authorities to reverse the inadmissi-
bility decis ions for those who cannot  be returned and examine cases on their 
merits. 
A law that threatens  asylum seek ers’ rights was adopted in Sept ember. NGOs 
and the CoE commiss ioner for h uman rights raised the alarm  over the law, which 
undermines the right to asylum and weakens safeguards against detention and return to the risk of persecution or other human rights abuse. 
During the year, the European Court of Human Rights issued interim measures 
for at least 13 cases regarding liv ing conditions for vulnerable people trapped in 
migrant camps on the Aegean islands, requesting the urgent transfer of individu-als and their families int o safer accommodation, and their immediate access to 
urgently needed medical care. In most of the cases, authorities have failed to act. 
One year after the Moria camp on Lesbos 
burned down , there was little prog ress 
towards improving living conditions for migrants there. Although thousands were relocated to other parts of Greece, more than 
4,000 remained  at time of 
writing on the Aegean islands, including 3,819 contained in camps. In May, the CoE commissioner for human rights 
warned  that the government’s plan to build 
new closed reception centres  created a risk of large-scale, long -term detention. 
The first such center opened on Samos  at the end of September.  
283HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn January, limited government soil testing confirmed  dangerous levels of lead in 
some ar eas of one of the camps on L esbos, Mavrovou ni, built on of a former mili-
tary shooting range. Despite the government taking some positive steps to ad-dress the situation, including fencing off an ar ea with elevated lead levels, at 
time of writing, dozens of residents 
continued to live  in tents in areas c ontami-
nated by lead . Authorities ignored calls to c onduct compr ehensive  testing and 
remove all residents living near lead-contaminated areas. 
By mid-October, 1,047 unaccompanied ch ildren and 3,416 others deemed vul-
nerable had been relocated  from Greece to other EU and associated countries, 
including 2,812 to Germany. 
Migrant Children  
In a January  landmark de cision, the European C ommittee of Socia l Rights found 
that Greece violates the rights of asylum-seeking children, citing inadequate, un-
healthy, and dangerous living conditions, homelessness, and inadequate access 
to healthcare and education. 
Data on  school closures  in Greece linked to Covid-19 underscored significant dis-
ruption to education for children in the country during 2021. According to the ombudsman for children’s rights, only one in seven asylum-seeking children liv-
ing in camps on the mainl and, and none on the islands, was able to  attend 
school in the 2020-2021 school year. During school closures, no Wi-Fi hotspots, 
tablets, or laptops were provided to children in camps. Some camps were locked down to prevent the spread of Covid-19, with children unable to leave for school 
and no alternative education provided. In some cases, local officials prevented children from enrolling in public scho ols in nearby communities. There were 
per-
sistent delays  in opening c lasses f or children who do not speak Greek. 
By mid-August,  21 unaccompanied children  were detained in police-run facilities 
despite Greece’s abolition of the so-cal led “protective custody” regime in De-
cember 2020. No government statistics have been published since then on child detention. 
284WORLD REPORT 2022Attacks on Civil Society  
Greek authorities’ use of  criminal  investig ations to ha rass and  intimidate groups 
that investigate abuses against migrants at Greece’s border continued.  
News emerged  in July that 10 individuals, inc luding 4 members of NGOs, are fac-
ing criminal investigation for allegedly fa cilitating the irregular entry of foreign 
nationals from Turkey  to Lesbos. No indict ment was issued  following a similar in-
vestigation announced  in September 20 20, suggesting th at it was a f orm of state 
harass ment.  
In March, three UN special rapporteurs addressed a joint letter  to the govern-
ment expressing concern about 2020 regulations hampering the work of NGOs focused on asylum and migration. According to a May 
report  from NGO Refugee 
Support Aegean (RSA), since December 2020, 78 groups have had their applica-tions rejected and another 97 have pending applications on the NGO Registry. Most provide services in camps for asylum seekers. Judicial review 
applications  
challenging the legal framework are pending before the Council of State. 
In its July EU-wide  rule of law report , the European Comm ission expressed con-
cern about the narrow ing space for civil society  groups work ing with migrants 
and asylum seekers. It also said that despite reforms in the judicial system, con-cerns remain around the procedure  of appointinga senior judges and prosecu-
tors.  
In September, the CoE h uman rights comm issioner 
urged the Greek 
parliament  to reconsider  legislative proposals  that hinder “life-saving” work and 
human rights monitoring by NGOs. The bill, whic h was adopted on Sept ember 3, 
introduces rest rictions and conditions  on NGOs act ive in areas of competence of 
the Greek Coast Guard, at the threat of heavy sanctions and fines. 
Freedom of Media  
At the end of 2020, journalist Dimitra Kroustalli resigned from the daily newspa-per To Vima, 
citing  “suffocating pressure” from the prime minister’s office follow-
ing a story she had written on the government’s flawed monitoring of Covid-19 cases.  
285HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe European C ommiss ion flagged conc erns about attacks and thr eats against 
journalists in Greece in its July rule of law report , in particular the killing of Greek 
investigative journalist Giorgos Karaivaz. At time of writing, no arrests had been made related to Karaivaz’s murder. 
In January, the citizen protection minister unveiled guidelines to implement a 
controversial 2020 law regulating demonstrations, which journalists are con-
cerned will 
restrict  their ability to report effectively. 
In April, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) raised concerns  about restrictions on 
media freedom in Greece, including the withho lding of government advertising 
from critical outlets, accusations of government censorship, as well as violence 
and ha rass ment  of journalists by police during demonstrations.  
Racism and Intolerance  
Statistics on hate crimes for 2020,  released in April  by the nongovernmental 
Racist Violence Recording Network (RVNR), showed an increase in incidents of racist violence against refugees and migr ants, and att acks on civil soc iety groups 
working with them. The RVNR recorded racist incidents in the context of police enforcement of Covid-19 movement restrictions. The RVRN also recorded 30 inci-
dents of verbal assault, physical vio lence, or sexual assault against individuals 
based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Of the 107 incidents of hate crimes documented by the RVRN, only 35 were  reported to the police. In 46 inci-
dents, the victims said that they would not take further actions due to fear, lack of trust in the authorities, or bureaucratic obstacles. 
Police statistics published in May on fines for breaches of Covid-19 measures on 
the islands of Lesbos, Chios, and Samos showed that between March 23, 2020 and May 24, 2021 74 percent of the fine s were issued against foreigners, despite 
the fact foreign nationals make up a small percentage of the islands’ population, raising concerns about the 
use of ethnic profiling , a long-standing issue  in 
Greece. Covid-19 movement restriction measures in camps across the country were stricter than for the general population.

Women’s Rights  
Violence against w omen was the subj ect of he ated debat e during the year, after 
Olympic medalist Sofia Bekatorou alleged  in January she had been sexually as-
saulted in 1998 by an official of the Greek sailing federation, triggering  a na-
tional “#MeToo” movement.  
In May, government passed a controversial family law,  despite the risk that the 
law poses to women and children who are victims of domestic violence. 
In March, nongovernmental group Diotima noted  that during the pandemic there 
was an increase in reported incidents  of domestic and other gender-based vio-
lence. At least 11 women have been mu rdered by their current or former hus-
bands or partners in the first nine months of  the year. The killings shocked the 
public, opening a debate on the issue of dom estic violence. Women face multi-
ple barriers  to reporting domestic violenc e and seeking help from the state. 
287HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHGuatemala 
Judicial independence has been threatened by corru ption, dela ys in appoint-
ments of judges, refusal by Congress to swear in the head judge of the Constitu-tional Court, removal of the chief of  the Special Prosecutor’s Office against 
Impunity (FECI), and spurious complaints against judges and p rosecutors inves-
tigating high profile cases. 
Harassment and vi olence against human rights defenders and jour nalists remain 
major concerns. Authorities have restricted access to information, including about vaccine purchases and other measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic.  
Guatemala faces challenges in protecting the rights of migrants; human rights 
defenders; women and girls; and lesbian, ga y, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
people. 
Judicial Independence and Corruption  
In recent years, investigations by the United Nations-backed International Com-
mission against Impunity in Guatemal a (CICIG)—terminated in 2018—and the At-
torney General’s Office have exposed corruption schemes in a ll three branches 
of government. However, measures adopted recently by Congress, the Attorney General’s Office and other authorities are impeding accountability and threaten-ing judicial independence. 
Congress has flouted a Constit utional Court order to  proceed with selecting 
judges and justices, for the period 2019 through 2024, for 13 seats on the 
Supreme Court and 135 seats on the Courts of Appeals. The seats remain vacant. The selection proce ss has been marred by c orruption alleg ations ba sed on an in-
vestigation by the Special Prosecutor Agains t Impunity (FECI) that revealed evi-
dence of possible influence peddling in the selection of judicial nominees. 
In April, Congress refused to swear in the re-elected Constitutional Court Judge 
Gloria Por ras who had led anti-corruption cases, because of  allegations  of irreg-
ularities in her selection process. The Council of the University of San Carlos, which selected Porra s, ratified its  decis ion after review ing the challenges and, in 
288WORLD REPORT 2022July, asked Congress to swear her in. At time of writing, Congress had not com-
plied. Fea rful of reprisa ls and spurious in vestigations, Porras fled Guatemala. 
On June 21, judges investigating high-profi le cases asked the Attorney General’s 
Office to review and di smiss old and spurious compl aints filed to ha rass them. 
The Inter-American Comm ission on Hum an Rights (IACHR) had issued pr ecau-
tionary measures ordering Guatemala to  protect the judges, but the government 
failed to comply with them. Judge Erika  Aifán, who convicted high-profile people 
in corruption cases, for example, faces more than 70 complaints that the govern-
ment has failed to inv estigate. Instead , the Constit utional Cour t ruled th at the 
Supreme Court can move forward with an attempt to strip her immunity. 
On July 23, Attorney General Consuelo Porras, who is not related to Judge Gloria 
Porras, removed Special Prosecutor’s Office against Impunity (FECI) Chief Juan 
Francisco Sandoval, alleging he humiliated her and citing lack of trust. Sandoval, 
whose office is probing several corruption cases originally handled by the CICIG, said Porras blocked or tried to b lock several  that imp licated high-r anking offi-
cials.  
Weeks before Sandoval’s r emoval, President Alejandr o Giammattei described 
his work as politicized and biased. A group of lawyers, seeking to dismantle the FECI, filed two complaints asking the Constit utional Court to declare it unconsti-
tutional.  
In September, the Cons titutional Cour t struck down a pro vision of the c riminal 
code that prohibited allowing people sentenced to five or more years of incarcer-ation for corruption from serving their sentences outside jail. They can now serve corruption sentences under house arrest, for example. 
Accountability for Past Human Rights Violations  
The limited progre ss that Guatemal a was mak ing in recent yea rs in adjudicating 
major crimes seems to have come to a standstill. Challenges persist in searching for and identifying the disappeared during the armed conflict, mainly Indigenous Mayans. 
In September, authorities and the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Founda-
tion, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), began efforts to recover the bodies 
289HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHof at least 116 Indigenous children believed to have been buried at a former mili-
tary garrison in the 1980s. Efforts were suspended at time of writing. 
In June, legislators presented  a bill for Peace and Reconciliation, seeking to end 
proceedings for crimes committ ed during the armed conflict. It is similar to a 
2019 bill shelved in April, after a Cons titutional Court judgment that held that 
pardons for crimes against humanity and  serious human rights violations are un-
constitutional and contrary to human rights standards. 
Freedom of Expression  
Guatemala is ranked 116 of 180 count ries on the World Press Freedom Index be-
cause of constant violence against the press and impunity for perpetrators. 
Since taking office in 2020 , President Giamm attei’s go vernment has unleas hed 
verbal attacks and imposed restrictions on the press. Authorities have restricted access to information during the pandemic. 
The Journalists’ Association of Guatemala r eported 149 physical or verbal at-
tacks or restrictions on journalists and media workers in 2020. As of August 2021, the organization had counted 79 att acks. Investigations  into threats, at-
tacks, and killings of journalists have made little progress. 
On July 30, Pedro Alfonso Guadrón Hernández, founder of the Facebook news 
page “Concepción L as Minas mi Tierra,” was shot de ad in Chiquimula depart-
ment. Guadrón covered local news, including anti-government protests, corrup-
tion, and drug trafficking. He had reportedly received death threats. 
Human Rights Defenders  
Attacks on human rights defenders and socia l leaders increased in 2020, the 
NGO Unidad de Protec ción a Defenso ras y Defensores de Derechos Humanos de 
Guatemala (Udefegua) reported, counting 1,00 4 attacks and 15 killings from Jan-
uary to December 15, 2020. 
In June, a law limiting the work of NGOs took effect, after the Constitutional Court 
struck down challenges to it. The law includes overly broad language that allows the executive to cancel the legal status of NGOs when they conduct activities contrary to “public order.” 
290WORLD REPORT 2022Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
The Observatory for Sexual and Reproduct ive Rights reported 57 ,578 pregnancies 
of adolescents and girls as of Ju ne, including 2,737 in girls between 10 and 14 
years old. Guatemalan law considers that all girls under 14 who have sexual rela-tions are victims of sexual violence.  
Abortion is legal only when a pregn ant person’s life is in danger.  
When President Giammattei, in July, announc ed a policy to develop inter-institu-
tional work on programs focused on “lif e and family pr otection,” he also empha-
sized that Guatemala protects  life starting from conception. 
Guatemala’s civil c ode limits the sex ual and repr oductive  rights of women and 
girls with disabilities, including by forcing sterilization and other contraceptive 
treatments without their consent. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Guatemala has no c omprehen sive civil legislation pr otecting people from dis-
crimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, nor a legal gender recognition procedure for transgender people.  
A 2021 Human Rights Watch report on violence and discrimination against LGBT 
people in Guatemala revealed that perpetrators included public security agents, gangs, and members of the public, including LGBT people’s family members. The 
report found that the government is fa iling to protect LGBT people adequately. 
Guatemalan civil society  organizations r eported that, as of September, at least 
21 LGBT people had been killed in 2021. One gay man and two transgender women—including Andrea González, legal repre sentative of the advocacy group 
OTRANS Queens of the Night—died in separate attacks during one week in June. Months earlier, González had asked the Attorney General’s Office for protection from death thr eats she was rece iving. 
291HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHDisability Rights  
Children with disabilities with high support r equirements are forced to live in in-
stitutions in Guatemala. There ar e few if any policies that would enable them to 
live in a family household. 
Asylum Seekers and Refugees  
In February, the United States ended the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA), implemented in July 2019 by former President  Donald Trump, which allowed the 
US to deport Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala on the false premise th at Guatemal a was capab le of examining their asylum cl aims fully 
and fairly. 
As part of US efforts to address the root causes of migration, Guatemala and the 
US reached several agreements, including to increase the number of Guatemala’s border security officers. In July, President Giammattei and US 
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas opened the first reception cen-ter for returned migrants. 
Since at least April, Guatemal a has been receiving groups of  migrants tr ying to 
reach the US that are being expelled from Mexico. Between August 22 and Octo-
ber 18, the Guatemalan Institute for Migration r egistered in El Ceibo, at the bor-
der with Mexico, 15,387 returnees, including 4,117 children. Most people sent to 
Guatemala are fr om Hond uras and El Salvador. Between January and Octo ber 19, 
4,072 unaccompanied Guatemalan minors were returned from Mexico to Tecún Úman, according to the institute. 
Covid-19  
As of early October, Guatemala counted more than 581,498 cases of Covid-19 and more than 14,118 deaths. The collapse of Guatemala’s public hospital sys-tem and limited  access to mass vacc inations are li kely contr ibuting factors. 
The vaccination progr am has lacked transpa rency. As of  September, on ly 1.7 mil-
lion of Guatemala’s 17 million people—10 per cent—had been fully vaccinated. 
The Sputnik vaccines the government purc hased, in a contract never made pub-
292WORLD REPORT 2022lic, were not delivered by a March dead line. In July, a renegotiated contract re-
duced the number of doses to be delivered by half. 
From March 2020 through February 2021, 4.2 million students missed at least 
three-quarters of c lassroom inst ruction due to Covid closures, according to 
UNICEF. Schools partially opened in January 2021. 
Key International Actors  
In February, the Unit ed Nations High Comm issioner for Human Rights reported 
that Guatem ala continues to face systemic and  structural hum an rights chal-
lenges, in particular poverty, inequality, discrimination, impunity, and insecurity, exacerbated by Covid-19. 
In June, United States Vice P resident Kamala Harris visited Guatemala. Fo llowing 
a bilateral meeting with President Giammattei, Harris announced the creation of an anticorruption task force that will include US prosecutors and law enforce-
ment experts and a regional task force to prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking. In Sept ember, the United  States s anctioned Consuelo P orras and her 
secretary by including them in the Undemocratic and Corrupt Actors List. 
In July, United Nations and Organization of American States experts expressed 
concern regarding the new NGOs law, claiming it violates international human rights standards and could criminalize human rights defenders. Also in July, UN 
rights experts expressed concern over violations of due process and health rights in the spurious p rosecution of Indigenous activist Bernardo Caal Xól, who 
opposed the Oxec hydroelectric project.  
In August, the IACHR expressed concern over actions jeopardizing judicial inde-
pendence, including the government’s firing of FE CI’s chief prosecutor, Con-
gress’s refusal to swear in the Constitutional Court’s re-elected president, and investigations against judges and pro secutors in high profi le cases, some of 
whom are beneficiaries of the IACHR’s precautionary measures. 
The IACHR held public hearings on two cases against Guatemala, one alleging 
persecution by state agents and the arbitrary  installation of a police substation 
on the complainant’s land, the other alleging that shots fired by Guatemalan au-thorities to detain a boat killed and wo unded people, and that authorities failed 
to investigate.
293HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHGuinea 
On September 5, Guinean army officers staged a coup and arrested President 
Alpha Condé , who won the October 2020 presidential election after a year-long 
effort to secure a third term in office . Col. Mamady Doumbouya , head of Guinea’s 
special forces and of the putschists, who called themselves the National Com-mittee for Reconciliation and Development ( Comité national du rassemblement 
et du développement, CNRD), 
proclaimed  the dissolution of the government and 
constitution and announced a transition period. On September 28, the new mili-tary authorities 
adopted  a transition al charter outlining the m issions and duties 
of the transitional government and appointed Doumbouya as head of the transi-tion. The international community widely criticized the coup. The Economic Com-munity of West African States (ECOWAS) 
suspended  Guinea’s membership on 
September 8 and imposed targeted sanctions , including travel bans and asset 
freezes, on the coup leaders and  their families on September 16.  
The coup came after a period of political instability following a March 2020 con-
stitutional referendum that allowed Condé to run for a third term and the October 
2020 presidential election, which were marred by violence . Security forces used 
excessive fo rce during oppo sition-led demonstrations  and arrested and detained 
over 350  leaders and members of the National  Front for the Defense of the Con-
stitution ( Front national pour la défense de la Constitution,  FNDC), a coalition of 
civil society groups  and opposition pa rties, during the period  surrounding the 
presidential vote. In April, Condé’s government released  40 of them. In Septem-
ber, the new military authorities released  79 others and allowed  4 opponents in 
exile to return to Guinea.  
Members of the security forces continued to enjoy almost total impunity  for the 
excessive u se of force and other human rights abuses, with the 2019 conviction 
of a police captain still the only known conviction of a member of the security forces for the dozens of protest deaths that occurred since Condé came to power in 2010.  
Condé’s government 
failed  to meet a self-imposed June 2020 deadline for the 
trial of alleged perpetra tors of the 200 9 stadium massacr e. There was some 
modest renewed progress  toward the trial in mid-2021. While the coup may dis-
rupt progress, Doumbouya announced  on September 5 that “justice will be the 
294WORLD REPORT 2022compass that will guide every Guinean citizen,” ma king a s ymbolic appearance 
at this year’s commemoration of the st adium mass acre. 
Guinea lost privileged access to the US market offered under the African Growth 
and Opportunity Act (AGOA). On November 2, the Biden administration an-
nounced  it intends to cut trade benefits for Guinea by January 1, 2022, “for not 
having established, or not making continual progress toward establishing, the protection of the rule of law and  of political pluralism.”  
Guinea’s penal code punishes undefined indecent acts or acts against nature 
with six months to three years in prison. 
Covid-19  
The health state of emergency, imposed by former President Condé in March 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19, is still in place. In July 2021, following in-creased confirmed cases, Condé 
imposed more restrictive measures , including a 
ban on large gatherings, and curfew at 10 p.m. instead of midnight, which had been 
maintained  by the new military authorities. The political opposition and 
civil society  have expressed  concerns about the use of the state of health emer-
gency as an excuse to quell dissent and violate rights.  
School closures due to the Covid-19 p andemic affected 2.6 mi llion children. 
After the pandemic’s start in 2020, schools were closed for 151 days, but re-opened in September 2020 and remained open through 2021. 
Release of Political Prisoners  
On April 29, authorities under former President Condé ordered the release of 40 
people  after the Dixinn court in Conakry fo und no grounds for prosecution. They 
had been in pretrial detention since Octo ber 2020, when they we re arrested on 
various charges following oppos ition-led demonstrations during the election pe-
riod. On May 5, authorities released  journalist Amadou Diouldé Diallo, who was 
arrested  in March after he criticized President Condé in one of his articles. On 
June 18 and 22, Condé granted pardons  to two political opponents, Souleymane 
Condé, FNDC coordinator, and Yo ussouf Diabaté, a FNDC member. 
295HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn September 7 , the new military authorities  released  79 political prisoners. 
They included leaders and members of the main opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea ( Union des forces démocratiques de Guinée , 
UFDG), including Abdoulaye Bah, and FNDC’s O umar Sylla, alias Foniké Mengué. 
Foniké Mengué—arrested on September 29, 20 20, in Conakry while preparing to 
participate in an FNDC -led protest ag ainst President C ondé’s de cision to  run for a 
third t erm—was 
sentenced to three years  in prison for “communication and dis-
closure of false information, and threats of violence or death” during his appeal trial on June 10, 2021. On August 2, he 
was transferred to  a hospital  as his health 
deteriorated . He was on hunger strike  between December 25, 2020, and January 
8, 2021, protesting repe ated adjo urnments of  his trial.  He was also infected by 
Covid-19  in March while in detention at Conakry’s central prison. His relatives ac-
cused the government of denying him access to adequate medical treatment.  
Abdoulaye B ah was among a group of fo ur opposition members released  on 
health grounds in July by authorities u nder former President Condé, along with 
Ibrahima Cherif Bah, Ousmane Goudal Diallo, and Cellou Balde. The four had been arrested in November 2020 for alleged involvement in post-election vio-
lence. However, on August 10, Abdoulaye Bah 
was re turned  to prison for “violat-
ing the conditions of his release.”  
On September 18, the new military authorities allowed  four exiled political oppo-
nents to return to Guinea, including FNDC member Sékou Koundouno. Guinean judicial authorities 
had issued an international arrest warrant  against 
Koundouno in August, for criminal as sociation, arson, insurr ection, and disturb-
ing the state through killing, destruction, and looting. 
Deaths in Custody, Arbitrary Arrests, and Restrictions on the 
Opposition  
Four suspected political opposition supporters died in custody  between Novem-
ber 2020 and January 2021. Mamadou Oury Barry, 21, detained as a suspected political opposition supporter, 
died  on January 16. His family and lawyer said  he 
died in his cell and did not receive proper medical attention for ill-treatment and an illness he suffered in detention, but authorities 
stated  that he died at the 
hospital of “na tural caus es.”  
296WORLD REPORT 2022On February 3, the Dixinn Court of First Instance in Conakry ruled  that the head-
quarters of the main opposition party, the UFDG, which had been shut down in 
October 2020 , should remain closed. On March 17 , Conakry’s airport authorities 
prevented  Cellou Dalein Diallo, leader of the UFDG, from traveling to Ivory Coast 
and seized his passport. On May 24, the p rosecutor of the Dixinn Court of First 
Instance said  his travel ban had been maintained and could be further extended. 
Authorities did not provide any explanation for the ban. The new military authori-
ties lifted  the travel ban in September and allowed Diallo to access his offices.  
On July 9, judicial authorities sentenced  Ismaël Condé, a former member of the 
ruling party who joined the opposition, to three years and four months in prison for “insulting the head of state,” after he dec lared that only weapons could drive 
Alpha Condé from power.  
Accountability for Serious Abuses  
Although Condé’s government announced  investigations into alleged security 
force abuses during demonstrations—including the establishment of a pool of judges to investigate the “serious p rovocations, abuses, and destruction” com-
mitted in Conakry during the March 2020 legislative elections and referendum—a lack of political will, limited investigative capacity, and witnesses’ unwillingness to come forward meant that most investigations did not result in charges against members of  the security forces. The 
trial of several police offi-
cers for using a woman as a human shield  to protect themselves from protesters 
in January 2020, which opened in March 2020, stalled. 
Twelve years after security forces massacred  over 150 peaceful opposition sup-
porters and raped dozens of women at a stadium on September 28, 2009, those 
responsible have not been tried . 
Even before the coup, concerns over an evident lack of will for the trial to go for-
ward in Guinea increased amid stagnation in the organization of the trial by the justice sector. Nevertheless, in mid-2021, there were some new developments, with 
renewed meetings  of a strategic committee established to plan the trial, 
construction of the courtroom underway, and training of magistrates planned. Several people charged in the case have been in detention beyond the legal limit while they wait for the trial to start. 
297HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn December 2020, the International Criminal Court, which is conducting a pre-
liminary examin ation of the 2009 massacre, expres sed its disappointment  in the 
fact that the trial had not yet opened and st ated it was look ing to Guinean au-
thorities to demonstrate their willingness and ability to fight impunity in the 
coming months.  
Natural Resources  
Guinea’s na tural resources, notably b auxite, the or e needed to produce alu-
minum, remained central to the economy. The bauxite sector continued to ex-pand rapidly in the Boké and Boffa regions, leading to thousands of farmers 
losing their land to mines, often f or inadequate compensation, and damaging 
vital water sources in the area. A 
coalition  of car manufacturers, who are increas-
ing their demand for aluminum  as they transition to electric vehicles, in January 
2021 expressed concern about bauxite mining companies’ practices in Guinea. 
A Chinese-backed consortium continued preparations  for development of the 
massive Simandou iron ore deposit in south eastern Guinea. The consortium, 
which is already Guinea’s largest  bauxite exporte r, has in the past fai led to re-
spect international human rights and environmental standards. 
Guinea’s new military government on September 16 reassured  mining compa-
nies that they could continue their operations, but said it would ensure mining revenues improve living standards and  that mining companies respect strong 
environmental and social standards. The 
Extractive Industries Transparency Ini-
tiative  (EITI), a global resource revenue transparency initiative that counts 
Guinea as a member, warned  that the coup could undermine accountable gover-
nance. 
On May 8, a landslide at a clandestine gold mine in Guinea’s north-eastern Sigu-
iri region killed  15 people. The government announced the opening of an investi-
gation to ascertain the circumstances and causes of the incident. There are hundreds of unofficial artisanal mines around Siguiri. 
298WORLD REPORT 2022Haiti 
The Covid-19 p andemic and associated ec onomic cr isis, the ass assin ation of 
President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021, and a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in August exacerbated Haiti’s existing challenges of political instability and violence by 
gangs often tied to st ate actors. Haiti has c ontinuously struggled to meet the 
basic needs of its people and resolve long-standing human rights problems. 
Since the government’s announcement in 2018 that it would eliminate fuel sub-
sidies, widesp read civil unrest has paralyzed  Haiti. Demonstrations  intensified 
in 2019, amid evidence of embezzlement of funds intended for infrastructure and healthcare under the last three governments. Demonstrations increased 
again in 2021, against Moïse’s government and his proposed constitutional ref-
erendum. Police res ponded with exce ssive fo rce. Impunity for g ang and police vi-
olence continued. 
The earthquake, followed by Tropical St orm Grace, affected 2 million people in 
Haiti’s southern peninsula—77 percent of which lived below the poverty line—and left 2,246 dead, more than 12,700 injured, up to 26,000 displaced, and at least 329 missing.  
Political Crisis  
Haiti’s Superior Council of the Judiciary ruled on February 6, 2021, that Moïse’s presidency would end the next day, but Moïse argued his term would end on February 7 , 2022, five years after he took office. He had been ruling by decree since January 2020, due to the inexistence of a seated parliament given post-
poned legislative elections. 
On February 7 , 2021, police detained Supreme Court Justice Yvickel Dieujuste 
Dabrésil, whom the political  opposition was al legedly poi sed to nomin ate as 
provisional president. The following day, Moïse decreed Dab résil’s retirement, 
along with those of Justices Josep h Mécènes Jean-Louis, whom the opposition 
appointed as provisional p resident after D abrésil’s arrest, and Wendelle Coq 
Thélot, who had opposed Moïse’s appointment by decree of all members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in September 2020. 
299HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMoïse charged the CEP with carrying out presidential and legislative elections 
and a constitutional referendum in 2021, despite a constitutional prohibition on modifying the constitution through a referendum. 
Demonstrators who opposed the referendum and planning for elections de-
manded that the president step down and that a transitional government be put in place. 
On July 7 , a group of armed people burst into President Moïse’s private residence 
in Port-au-Prince, killed him, and injured his wife. On July 20, Ariel Henry, whom Moïse had appointed prime minister days bef ore the assassi nation, was in-
stalled as head  of a new gov ernment. Some civil society  organizations said his 
installment as head  of state was un constitutional.  
In September, an Independent Advisory Committee created by Moïse in 2020 
presented the draft of a new constitution to Ariel Henry, who signed a political agreement with the opposition to carry out general elections in 2022. 
Investigation of President Moïse’s Assassination  
A day after the assassin ation, Haitian police eng aged in a shoot out with sus-
pected ass assins, killing several and taking other s into custody. 
In late July, two judges and  two clerks of the Court of Peace who conducted judi-
cial proceedings regarding the murder of  President Moïse were threatened.  
On August 9, Justice M athieu Chanlatte was appointed to lead the judic ial inves-
tigation into President Moïse’s killing. In circumstances still under investigation, his clerk died on August 11. Two days later, the judge withdrew from the case, cit-ing personal rea sons. On August 22, Justice Garry Orélien was designated  to re-
place him. 
As of August, the Haitian National Police (HNP) and the National Human Rights 
Defense Network (RNDDH) reported 3 people killed and 44 arrested—including 
former Colombian military officers—in connection with President Moïse’s assas-sination. Official s of the Colombian Ombudsperson’s Office  who visited the 
Colombian ex-military detainees in Port- au-Prince reported that they had not 
been presented to a judicial authority, had not had access to legal assist ance, 
and were being held incommunicado in a six-by-two-meter cell without sunlight, 
300WORLD REPORT 2022handcuffed, and sleeping on the floor. Some of the detainees claimed they had 
been tortured by police. 
Violence and Displacement  
Violence is escalating. The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) re-ported 1,074 intentional homicides and 328 kidnappings from January to August 
2021. Intentional homicides increased by 14 per cent, compared with 944 cases 
in the same period of 2020, and kidnappings continued to rise, compared with 234 for all of 2020. According to the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI) 
and the Institute for Justice & Democr acy in Haiti (IJDH) gender-based violence is 
chronically under-reported. 
Some 95 gangs are fighting over territory in Port-au-Prince, where approximately 
1.5 million people liv e, displacing 19 ,100. Haitian civil society  groups say insecu-
rity is exacerbated by alleged comp licity between politicians and gangs. 
Under Moïse, since 2018, the IJDH, the RNDDH, and the Fondasyon Je Klere 
(FJKL), three nongovernment al organiz ations, documented  18 massacres  in Port-
au-Prince. In 2021, in Martissant, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, gang members ki lled 4 people and injured 2 more; in 
Cité Soleil, gang clashes killed a minor and 10 gang members; and in Del mas 32 
and other neighborhoods armed individuals killed 19 people. At time of writing, no one had been charged or convicted for these massacres. Former polic eman 
Jimmy Chérizier, who leads the “G9” gangs federation, is allegedly implicated in 
most cases and remains free.  
Human Rights Defenders  
BINUH documented 32 cases of att acks, threats, and intimidation against 
judges, human rights defenders and journali sts, from February to August 2021. 
RNDDH Director Pierre Espérance received a death threat from the “G9” in June. 
Diego Charles, an anticorru ption act ivist and r eporter, and Ant oinette Duclaire, a 
feminist, politic al activis t, and journalist , were both killed on June 29  by armed 
individuals at the Christ-Roi neighborhood. 
301HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAt time of writing, eight people had been detained in connection with the August 
2020 killing of Monferrier Dorval, head of the Port-au-Prince bar association, but no one had been charged.  
In 2019, Charlot Jeudy, the President of Kouraj, an organization advocating for 
the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual , and transgender (LGB T) people, was found 
dead in his home. Circumstances surrounding his death and the results of an au-topsy remained publicly unknown at the time of writing. 
Criminal Justice System  
Haiti’s prisons remain severely overcrowded, with many detainees living in inhu-mane conditions. Overcrowding is largely att ributable to pretrial detentions, 
BINUH and OHCHR reported in 2021.  
As of September, prisons housed nearly 11,000 detainees, 82 percent of whom 
were awaiting trial. New criminal and criminal procedure codes set to enter into force in June 2022 provide alternative measures to pretrial detention and estab-lish detention of children as a measure of last resort.  
Abuses by Security Forces  
Protests against the go vernment continued  to be repressed w ith exce ssive u se of 
force. The RNDDH, in January 2021, reported at least 8 journalists injured, 10 demons trators and 13 political act ivists arbitrarily arreste d, and 2 students 
beaten by police during several pro tests. In February, the Inter-American Com-
mission on Human Rights (IACHR) reported two cases of journalists injured with rubber bullets. 
On February 25, a prison breakout at the Croix-des-Bouquets penitentiary left the 
prison director and 29 prisoners dead. BINUH reported law enforcement agents 
arbitrarily killed 25.  
From February to May, BINUH reported 238 cases of human rights violations by 
police, including 42 killings and indi scriminate use of tear gas. 
302WORLD REPORT 2022Accountability for Past Abuses  
In 2014, a court of appeal ordered inv estigations re-opened into arbitrary deten-
tions, torture, disappearances, summary executions, and forced exile during Jean Claude Duvalier’s presidency (1971-1986). As of September 2021, investiga-tions remained pending. 
In 2020, f ormer Haitian death squad  leader Emmanuel  “Toto” Cons tant was de-
ported from the US. In 2000, he had been co nvicted in absentia for involvement 
in a 1994 massacre in Gonaïve s. He remained in det ention at time of writing.  
Rights to Health, Water, and Food  
The country’s most vulnerable communitie s face dramatic floods and soil ero-
sion caused by defo restation that  has nearly eliminated fo rest cover in the coun-
try, leading to reduced agricul tural pr oductivity.  
Over a third of the population lacks access to clean water and two-thirds have 
limited or no sanitation service. More th an a third of Haitians—4.4 million—live 
with food insecurity, international agencies report, and 217 ,000 children suffer 
moderate to severe malnutrition.  
Without appropriate adaptation, decreased rainfall and rising temperatures 
driven by climate ch ange will inc reasingly neg atively imp act agricultur e and ac-
cess to water. 
After the 2 021 ear thquake, water and sanit ation inf rastructure suffe red extensive 
damage. Of 159 health facilities, 88 had been reportedly affected. Displaced people are exposed to a heightened risk of  infectious diseases and the virus that 
causes Covid-19.  
Inequality and Barr iers to Education  
Just under half of Haitians aged 15 and older are illiterate. The country’s educa-
tion system is highly unequal. The quality of public education is generally very poor, and 85 percent of schools are priva te, charging fees that exclude most chil-
dren from low-income families.  
303HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOver 3 million children had been unable to  attend school for months at a time 
during the past two years, for security reasons, as well as Covid-19 related re-strictions. 
The 2021 earthquake destroyed or heavily damaged 308 schools, affecting 
100,000 children. Schools were set to open on September 21, but the opening delayed until October 4 in the affected  area. Before the earthquake, UNICEF esti-
mated that 500,000 children were at risk of dropping out. 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Gender-based  violence is c ommon. Rape was only exp licitly c riminalized  in 
2005, by ministerial decr ee. Gender-ba sed violence was already  one of the high-
est risks for girls and women in the southern province even before the earth-
quake, with sexual exploitation prevalent  in some areas; these risks were 
expected to rise in the wake of the 2021 earthquake. 
A new penal code set to enter into fo rce in June 20 22 lists sex ual ha rass ment 
and gender-based violence as punishable offenses. The code will legalize abor-tion
 in all circumstances until the twelfth w eek of pregnancy, in cases of rape or 
incest, or if the mental or physical health of the woman is in danger.  It will lower 
the legal age for consensual sex to 15. 
Disability Rights  
Around 15 percent of the Haitian population lives with a disability, the World Health Organization reports.  
Although Haiti ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
its legislative fr amework has not been harmonized  and includes offensive  and 
discrimin atory provisions against people with disabilities. People with disabili-
ties continue experiencing discrimination in access to public services such as health, education, and justice and are at higher risk of suffering violence due to the significant social stigma and exclusion they face. Civil legislation restricts legal capacity for people with certain types of disabilities. 
The new penal code includes provisions prohib iting violence or incitement 
against people with disabilities. 
304WORLD REPORT 2022Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
LGBT people continue to suffer high levels of discrimination in Haiti, and no com-
prehen sive legal fr amework forbids it.  
The new penal code, not yet in force, will make any crime motivated by its tar-
get’s real or perceived sexual orientation an aggravated offense. The code pun-ishes any murder motivated by a victim’s  sexual orientation with up to life 
imprisonment. 
In 2017 , the Senate passed two anti-L GBT bills, which remained pending in the 
Chamber of Deputies at time of writing. One bans same-sex marriage and public 
support or advocacy for LGBT rights. The other establishes homosexuality as a one of the possible reasons for denial of a Certificat de Bonne Vie et Mœurs (a certificate of good standing r equired as proof that a per son has not committed a 
felony).  
Migration  
In September 2020, the Dominican Republic restarted deportations of undocu-mented Haitians, ending a pandemic moratorium. In January 2021, Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader and Jovenel Moïse agreed to address irregular migration and improve border security. The precarious status of Dominicans of Haitian descent and Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic remains a seri-ous concern.  
In February 2021, Abinader announced construction of a wall on the border. In 
August, the Dominican Ministry of Defense reported more than 178,000 Haitians forcibly repa triated.  
On September 28, the Dominican Republic’s National Migration Council adopted 
a policy that prevents any foreign per son who “would result in an unreasonable 
burden on public finances” from ent ering the country, including women who are 
at least six months pregnant. 
In May 2021, the US extended a Tempor ary Protected Status 18-month designa-
tion for Haitians in the US  for another 18 months. Howeve r, the US has c ontinued 
to carry out expuls ions of arriving Haitian migrants and asylum seekers to Haiti 
throughout the pandemic and, in September , it deployed border agents on 
305HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHhorseback against Haitians seeking to enter the US through the US-Mexico bor-
der. Between taking office on January 20, 2021, and late November, the Biden administration expelled approximately  12,000 Haitians, a dramatic increase 
from 2020, when 895 Haitians were expelled from the country. 
Mining and Access to Information  
Haiti is one of the most densely populated countries in the Western Hemisphere, and environmental degradation is a concern. In the past decade, foreign in-vestors have pursued the development of the mining sector. Resistance is wide-spread, as communities fear the industry will destroy their farmland and further contaminate their water. 
A 2017 draft mining law is silent on the rights of those displaced by mining activ-
ities, the Global Justice Clinic of New York University School of Law reports, and it 
grants insufficient time for review of the environmental impacts of new mining 
projects. It cont ains provisions that could render c ompany docu ments, including 
environmental and social impacts, confidenti al for 10 years, preventing mean-
ingful consultation with communities. The draft remained under consideration as of September 2021.  
Key International Actors  
In November 2020, the International Federation of Football Association (FIFA) Ethics Committee sanctioned Haitian Football Federation (FHF) President Yves Jean-Bart with a lifetime ban, following its  investigation into evidence of system-
atic sexual abuse of female players. As of July 2021, FIFA had suspended four ad-ditional senior FHF officials in connection with the abuses and banned another one from the sport for life. 
After the August 2021 earthquake, the UN appealed for US$187.3 million to pro-
vide relief including shelter , water and sanitation, emergency healthcare, food, 
protection, and early recovery. In August, the US Agency for International Devel-opment announced  $32 million in hum anitarian assistanc e in response to the 
earthquake. 
306WORLD REPORT 2022The US government and the Organization of American States supported Ariel 
Henry and his aim to  hold elections  in 2022, though act ivists w arned that  condi-
tions were not conducive  to free and fair elections.  
Haiti’s political and humanitarian situation continue being discussed at the UN 
Security Council. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called on all member states to suppor t Haiti in overcoming the humanit arian crisi s. BINUH’s m andate 
was ext ended to Ju ly 15, 2022. 
307HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHHonduras  
Violent organized crime continues to disrupt Honduran society and push many 
people to leave the countr y. Journalis ts; environment al activis ts; human rights 
defenders; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  transgender (LGBT) individuals; and peo-
ple with disabilities ar e among the groups target ed for violence.  
Impunity remains the norm. Efforts to re form public security institutions have 
stalled. Marred by corruption and abuse, the judiciary and police remain largely 
ineffective. Support and  resources fr om a fo ur-year Organization of  American 
States (OAS) miss ion to strengthen the fight against corru ption and imp unity, 
concluded in January 2020, have not produced lasting reforms. Anti-corruption prosecutors have been left defenseless.  
Gangs 
Gang violence is widespread in and arou nd urban areas. Estimates of the num-
ber of active gang members range from 5,000 to 40,000. From 2015 through 2019, authorities arrested 4,1 96 gang members, the National Police reported. 
Gangs exercise territorial control over some neighborhoods and extort residents 
throughout the country. They forcibly rec ruit children and se xually abuse women, 
girls, and LGBT people. Gangs kill, dis appear, rape, or displace those who resist. 
Gangs, particularly the Mara Salvatrucha  (MS-13) and the 18th Street Gang (Bar-
rio 18), are consider ed largely res ponsible for Honduras’ mur der rate, and are in-
famous for extortion and drug pedd ling. Although Hond uras has r educed its 
homicide rate by half since 2011, it remains one of the world’s highest, with 44.8 murders per 100,000 population in 2019. 
Historically, governments have responded to  organized crime with iron-fist secu-
rity strategies. In 2018, the government crea ted a special force to fight gangs 
(Fuerza Nacion al Anti Ma ras y Pandillas), with members from the po lice, military, 
and Attorney General’s Office. 
Weak state institutions and abuses by security forces have contributed to per-
sistent gang violence. There have been r epeated allegations of collusion be-
tween security forces and criminal organizations. 
308WORLD REPORT 2022Criminal Justice System and Impunity 
The criminal justice system regularly fails  to hold accountable those responsible 
for crimes and abuses.  
Judges face interference—including political  pressure, thr eats, and harass-
ment—from the executive branch, private  actors with connections to govern-
ment, and gangs. Prosecutor s and whistleblowers have received death threats. 
The Supreme Court, particul arly its pres ident, exerts excessive control over the 
appointment and removal of judges, and career instability limits judges’ inde-
pendence. 
In January 2020, the government s hut down the M ission to Su pport the Fight 
against Corruption and  Impunity in Hond uras (MA CCIH). Estab lished in 2016 by 
the government and the OAS, MACCIH contributed to the prosecution of 133 peo-ple, including congresspeople and senior offic ials, 14 of whom stood trial. 
Since MACCIH left, the Attorney  General’s Office  has harassed and intimid ated 
the head of its own anti-corruption crimin al enterprise office, Prosecutor Luis 
Javier Santos, and members of his team. International organizations, the United 
States, and the United Kingdom have expressed their support for Santos’ work. 
Human Rights Defenders 
In 2019, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders called Hond uras one of the most d angerous co untries for them in Latin America. 
Activists say the government’s  Mechanism f or the Protection of Journali sts, 
Human Rights Defender s, and Justice Activis ts, created in 2015, is ineffective. 
In June 2021, the Inter-American Commision on Human Rights (IACHR) estimated 
a 90 percent rate of impunity for c rimes committed against human rights defend-
ers in Hondura s. The IACHR re ceived inform ation on frequent threats of  lawsuits 
and prosecutions, including for slander and  libel, hindering human rights work 
in Hond uras. 
In July, the Office of the High Comm issioner of Human Rights  (OHCHR) and the 
IACHR urged the government to refrain from charging Garifuna women with dam-
age, threats, theft, and  usurpation of lands. Hond uras has fai led to uphold the 
Garifuna’s right to collective tenure over their lands and to promptly and ade-
309HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHquately inves tigate thre ats and acts  of harass ment against commu nity leaders, 
the IACHR stated in 2020. 
In August, a former director of the Hondur an hydroelectric company DESA was 
convicted of  organizing the 2016 assassin ation of environment al and  Indigenous 
rights defender Berta Cáceres, who opposed construction of a hydroelectric dam 
on the Gualcarque river. In 2019, seven others were convicted for carrying out the killing. The tria l has been marred by irregularities. 
Attacks on Journalists  
Hond uras is one of the Western Hemi sphere’s dead liest countries f or journalists, 
with security forces representing their bigg est threat, Reporters Without Borders 
noted in 2021. Since 2010, 42 journalists have been killed, UNESCO reported. According to the Inter-American Press Association, 29 journalists were benefici-aries of official protective measures.  
In February, journalist Henry Fiallos and  his family received anonymous death 
threats after he covered a femicide in whic h police officers were implicated. In 
August, he reported having been brutally  beaten by police officers while doing 
his job.  
Internal Displacement, Migration, and Asylum 
As of Decem ber 2020, int ernally displaced people in Hond uras rep resented al-
most 80 percent of the internally displaced population in Central America and Mexico. Around 191,000 people were intern ally displaced because of violence 
between 2004 and 2018, the government reported. In 2020, hurricanes Eta and Iota forced more than 55,000 to move int o temporary shelters, according to the 
Red Cross.  
The groups most likely to be internally di splaced are children subjected to forced 
gang recruitment, professionals and business owners who face extortion, do-
mestic violence survivors, and LGBT peop le and members of ethnic minorities 
who face violence and discrimin ation, the IACHR has reporte d. Rural communi-
ties subject to increased food insecurity  due to prolonged drought and extreme 
weather events are also vulnerable to displacement. 
310WORLD REPORT 2022A bill was introduc ed in 2019 to prev ent, assist, and protect  people int ernally 
displaced by violence. In June 2020, Congress passed a new penal code that in-troduced the crime of internal displacement, punishing, with prison sentences of six to nine years, those who, through violence or intimidation, force someone to 
abandon or change their place of living. 
In January 2021, the IACHR and the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of 
internally displaced persons urged the government to adopt a law protecting in-
ternally displaced people. 
From January to September 2021, 31,894 Hondurans requested asylum in Mex-
ico, the Mexican Comm ission for Re fugee Aid (COMAR) reported—filing more 
than 35 percent of Mexico’s total asylum petitions. From January to July, 7 ,007 ac-companied and 676 unaccompanied Hondur an children requested asylum. In a 
2020 survey by UNHCR and UNICEF, half of Hondurans interviewed in Mexico named violence as the main reason for their leaving. 
As of October 17 , 42,357 Hondurans  were deported in 2 021 to Hondura s—more 
than the total throughout 2020—the government reported. Of those, 37 ,114 were deported from Mexico and 4,689 from the US. Human Rights Watch documented 
mass expuls ion of migrants  and a sylum seekers, inc luding Hondurans, from 
Mexico to a remote jungle in Guatemala. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
LGBT people are frequently targets of  discrimination, extortion, and violence 
from gangs, the n ational civil polic e and military police, and mem bers of the 
public. Discrimination is also common in sc hools, the workplace, and in the 
home. Violence against LGBT individuals displaces many internally and forces others to leave the country to seek asylum. 
In June, the Inter -American Court of H uman Rights held that  Hond uras violated 
the rights to life and personal integrity of Vicky Hernández, a transgender woman killed du ring the 2009 coup. The court found that Hern ández suffere d harass-
ment by polic e the night before s he was killed , the police and mi litary had effec-
tive control of  the streets on the night she died, and  Hond uras c onducted no 
effective inves tigation into her ki lling. The court ordered  Hond uras to tr ain secu-
311HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHrity forces to investigate anti-LGBT vio lence and to adopt a process allowing peo-
ple to change the gender listed on their documents to match their identity. 
In January, Congre ss voted to increase the maj ority needed to amend Hond uras’s  
constitutional ban on same sex marri age from two-thirds to three-quarters, 
thereby further entrenching the prohibition.  
In September, President Hernández accused  those who advocat e for same-sex 
marriage of “attacking Christian princ iples” and “the notion of the family.” 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights 
Hond uras has the highest rate of femicide—defined  as the kil ling of a wo man by 
a man because of her gender—in Latin America, the UN Economic C ommiss ion 
for Latin America and the Caribbean reports.  
As of August  5, 174 femicides have been committ ed in Hond uras in 2021 accord-
ing to the Women’s Rights Center, a Honduran nongovernmental organization. In 2013, Hond uras ref ormed the penal  code to recognize femicide as a crime. 
Women with disabilities are not included in general policies to prevent violence 
against women. Hond uras lacks a c omprehen sive legislative framework th at in-
cludes women with disabilitie s and policies to combat domestic violence. 
Abortion is illegal in Hond uras u nder all circu mstances, with prison sent ences of 
up to six years. The law also sanctions  abortion providers. In January, legislators 
increased the ma jority needed  to amend the pro vision b anning abortion from 
two-thirds to three-quarters. 
Girls and adolescents younger than 19 carr y 15 percent of all pregnancies, the 
Monitoring Mechanism of the Belém do Pará Convention reported in 2016. Thirty-four percent of women ages 20 to 24 had married when they were 15 to 19, a UN Population Fund study conducted from 2005 to 2019 found. 
Children’s Rights 
Hondura s’ fragile instit utions fail to pr otect the rights of chi ldren, including ado-
lescents, and ensure that they have access to basic services such as education and healthcare, the IACHR reported in 2019.  
312WORLD REPORT 2022In 2019, more than 360,000 children between 5 and 17 years old worked, and 
only half of children under 18 years old attended school, according to the Na-
tional Statistics Unit. 
The Covid-19 p andemic has fur ther limited acce ss to educ ation. Schools were 
closed in March 20 20 and had not yet returned to full in-person c lasses by Sep-
tember 2021.  
Child recruitment by gangs has caused many children to flee and abandon 
school. The average age of first contact with gangs is 13 years old, a 2020 UN De-velopment Programme report found. 
Prison Conditions  
As of September, more than 20,000 people were detained in prisons with capac-ity for under 11,000. More than half of the men and two-thirds of the women were in pretrial detention, according to official statistics. 
Overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, poor sanitation, beatings, intra-gang vio-
lence, and killings are endemic in prisons. 
After 37 detainees were killed in a 2019 wave of gang violence, President Juan 
Orlando Hernández declared a state of  emergency—extended to December 
2021—and put prisons  under military cont rol. Assassin ations and violence con-
tinue under military su pervis ion. From January to June, the OV-UNAH docu-
mented eight violent deaths in prisons. 
To reduce overcrowding in response to the pandemic, the legislature approved 
alternatives to pretrial detention and judge s have released more than 1,600 peo-
ple. However, many petitions for p andemic release have been rejected. 
Key International Actors  
In February, the US announced suspension and planned termination of the “asy-
lum cooperative  agreement” signed w ith Hond uras in 2019,  whereby Honduras 
had agreed to receive non-Honduran a sylum-seekers transferr ed from the US. 
Several UN special rapporteurs and the Working Group on Enforced or Involun-
tary Disappearances warned, in April, of growing numbers of migrants from Hon-
313HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who have disappeared in Mexico, including 
741 Hondurans from March through August 2019. They called for implementation of protective measures. 
Hond uras voted in fav or of an OAS resolution rej ecting Venezuela’s  December 
2020 elections, which have been widely considered fraudulent. However, in June and October 2021 it abstained from OAS resolutions condemning arrests of Nicaraguan presidential opposition candidates and critics and demanding their release. 
In July, the US released  the “Engel List,” listing individuals from Hond uras, El 
Salvador, and Guatemala allegedly associated with corruption and undemocratic acts. It named  21 from Hond uras, including former Pres ident Porfirio Lobo Sosa 
(2010-2014), who became ineligib le for visas and adm ission to the US. 
In September, the OAS and Hond uras s igned an agr eement to allo w an OAS elec-
toral observation m ission to the November elections  to elect p resident, legisla-
tors, and local authorities. 
In October, Hond uras was elected as a member of the UN Hum an Rights Co uncil 
for the 2022-2024 term. 
314WORLD REPORT 2022Hungary 
The government continued its attacks on the rule of law and democratic institu-
tions in 2021. It also prolonged a state of emergency due to the Covid-19 pan-demic, allowing it to rule by decree on m atters related to public health, including 
by imposing restrictions on freedom of assembly and access to public informa-tion. 
The government continued its attacks on members of the lesbian, gay, 
bisexual  and transgender (LGBT) commu nity, ha rassment of independent media, 
and its discrimination of the Roma minority and undercut women’s rights. Ac-cess to the asylum procedure remains close to impossible. 
Attacks on Rule of Law  
The “state of danger”—a special legal  order granting overwhelming power to the 
executive to rule by decree—initiated in March 2020 in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and ext ended in December 2020 and Ju ne 2021 was effectively still 
in place at time of writing. Under the special legal order, government may use decrees to sus pend application of  acts of parli ament, derogate fr om provisions 
of acts, and take other extraordinary measures. Since March 2020, the govern-ment issued over 250 decrees, most, but not all of them, related to the pan-demic. A law adopted in May 2020 in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic gives the government power to unilaterally declare future public health emergencies, 
which would allow it to rule indefinit ely by decree by prolonging the emergency 
every six months with minimal or no parliamentary or judicial oversight.  
Freedom of Media  
The government c ontinued its harassment of independent media and freedom of 
expression. Most media outlets are directly  or indirectly controlled by the gov-
ernment which has a chil ling effect on independent journalism.  
In June, the Supreme Court upheld  a September 2020 de cision by the Media 
Council, and revoked the frequency for Klubradio, an independent radio station in Budapest. Klubradio was pushed off air in February. In August, the 
radio sta-
tion turned to the Constitutional Court, arguing that the stripping of its frequency 
315HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHby the Media Counci l was unconstit utional. The ca se was pending at time of writ-
ing. 
In July, Hungarian independent journalists who report critically on the Hungarian 
government were named on a leaked list of targets for Pegasus phone spyware, and at least one journ alist’s p hone was sub sequently determined  to have been 
compromised by the software. 
Academic Freedom  
The government continued its attacks on academic freedom during the year. In May, the 
government pushed through  a law to privatize public resources and 
public universities by creating “public trust funds performing a public function” and designated 32 entities, of whic h most manage higher education institutions, 
as universities. The entities receive large amounts of public funds and assets, members of governing bodies are loyal to the ruling party, and public scrutiny is 
impossible.  
Right to Health  
Long-standing neglect of the public health care system and deficiencies in Hun-garian hospitals, including lack of basic items such as hand soap and sanitizer, 
during spikes in Covid-19 cases may have contributed to high death rates—the highest per capita rate in the EU in the period from January/February 2020 to September 2021. By September, over 30,000 Covid-19 deaths were recorded. The vaccine rollout, which started in December 2020, alongside lockdowns and other restrictions, curbed the spread, drastically reduced cases, hospitaliza-tions, and Covid-19 related deaths.  
Discrimination against Roma  
Workplaces and schools continued to discriminate against Roma and many Roma live in abject poverty. At the early stages of vaccine rollout, authorities ef-fectively exc luded many Roma as regis tration for vaccine appointments was only 
available online and many Roma lack internet connectivity or have inadequate technical knowledge and digital literacy to navigate the internet. Local authori-ties in many cases failed to prov ide proper information and assist ance to Roma 
for vaccine registr ation; instead, local activis ts in Roma c ommunities aided  resi-
316WORLD REPORT 2022dents to register online. The lack of devices and connectivity  significantly im-
pacted Roma children’s ability to  access distance learning during school clo-
sures, further entrenching existing education inequalities .  
Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation  
The government continued  to restrict the rights of LGBT people. Transgender 
people are not legally allowed to change the gender markers  on their identifica-
tion documents. In December 2020, the parliament adopted a constitutional 
amendment  that states that only married couples will be eligible to adopt chil-
dren, with the minister in charge of family policies able to make exceptions on a 
case-by-case basis. It effectively exc ludes same-sex coup les, single people, and 
unmarried different-sex couple s from adopting children. The amendment in-
cludes language that stigmatizes tr ansgender people, stating that “children 
have the right to their identity in line with their sex at birth” and rejects diversity and inclusivity by mandating that ch ildren’s upbringing should be “in accor-
dance with the values based on our homeland’s constitutional identity and Christian culture.” 
In June, a new law falsely conflated pedophilia and homose xuality, prohibiting 
discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation. The law targets content “promoting” or “portraying” sexual and gender diversity, putting health providers, educators, artists, and broadc asters at risk of sanctions, including fi-
nancial and administrative penalties. An implementation decree in August put restrictions on shops selling products “promoting” or “portraying” sexual and gender diversity, banning all such sales within 200 meters of places frequented 
by children, and in all other ca ses required shops to separate those products in 
sealed packages. 
Migration and Asylum  
The country saw a significant decline in asylum applications in 2021 due to bor-der closures. Pushbacks from Hungar y to Serbia, sometimes violent, continued. 
The two transit zones on Hungary’s border with Serbia remained closed. In Au-gust, Hungary airlifted at-risk Afghans from Afghanistan, and per Covid-19 proto-
cols, quarantined them in the non-operational  transit z ones. Act ivists r eported 
317HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthat instead of processing airlifted Afghans under asylum law, authorities con-
sider their cases under the aliens policing act, as illegal migrants.  
In June, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that pushbacks on Hungar y’s 
border  with Serbia were a breach of the prohibition of co llective expulsion. Ac-
cording to official police statistics, border officials have carried out at least  
72,000 pushbacks since July 2016.  
Human Rights Defenders  
The government and ruling party members continued to smear human rights de-fenders, using government friendly  media to claim they are part of a wider Soros 
network and describe them “Soros mercen aries” or “national security risks.” 
In April, in response to a 2020 Court of Justice of the EU ruling that held a 2017 
law forcing civil society  organizations re ceiving more than €20,000 (ar ound 
$23,000) to declare themselves as foreign funded to be in violation of EU law, the governing majority adopted a bill to repeal  it. The repeal bill however failed 
to address the criminalization of organizations aiding asylum seekers and mi-grants, also part of the Court of Justice ruling. 
318WORLD REPORT 2022India 
Critics of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in India including ac-
tivis ts, journalists, pe aceful protester s, and even poets, actors, and businesses 
increasingly  risked politic ally motivated harass ment, prosecutions, and tax 
raids. Authorities shut down rights groups using foreign funding regulations  or 
allegations of financial irregularities.  
The government adopted laws and policies that  discriminated against religious 
minorities , especially Muslims. This, coupled with vilification of Muslims by 
some BJP leaders and police failure to take action against BJP supporters who commit violence, emboldened Hindu nationalist  groups to attack Muslims and 
government critics with impunity.  
A devastating second wave of Covid-19 in April exposed systemic weaknesses in 
India’s health infrastructure and the 
government’s mishandling of the pandemic . 
The authorities threatened action  against criticism of its pandemic response, 
and allegedly suppressed data  to downplay the thr eat of the pandemic.  
Jammu and Kashmir  
In February, the government finally lifted an 18-month internet shutdown  in 
Kashmir imposed in August 2019 when it revoked the state’s constitutional au-tonomy and split it into two federally gov erned territories.  
In September, after the 
death of separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani , the 
government once against imposed restrictions on movement and a near-total 
communications’ blackout for two days  to prevent  a mass g athering at h is fu-
neral. Geelani’s family alleged that they were denied the right to conduct proper 
final rites .  
In July, four UN human rights expert mandates  wrote to the Indian government 
urging an inquiry into the death in custody of separatist leader Muhammad Ashraf Kh an Sehrai, who was det ained in July 2020 under the Public Saf ety Act, a 
preventive detention law. In March, 
five UN expert mandates wrote to the gov-
ernment  seeking information about the detention of  Kashmiri politician Waheed 
Para, the alleged custodial killing of a shopkeeper Irfan Ahmad Dar, and the en-
319HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHforced disappearance of Naseer Ahmad Wani. They raised concerns about “the 
repressive  measures and bro ader pattern of sy stematic infringements of  funda-
mental rights used against the local population, as well as of intimidations, searches and confiscations committed by national security agents.” 
Journalists in Kashmir faced 
increased harass ment by the authorities , including 
raids and arrests  on terrorism charge s. In September, the police raided the 
homes of four Kashmiri journalists  and confiscated their phones and laptops. In 
June, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
expressed concerns  over “alleged arbitrary deten-
tion and intimidation of journalists covering the situation in Jammu and Kash-mir.” 
Impunity for Security Forces  
Allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings persisted with the National 
Human Rights Comm ission  registering 143 deaths in police custody and 104 al-
leged extrajudicial killings in the first nine months in 2021.  
After BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma became chief minister of Assam in May, 
his government’s “ zero tolerance policy” on crime led to an increase in police 
killings . By September, the police had reportedly killed 27 people in alleged ex-
trajudicial killings  and injured 40 others. In September, Assam police opened 
fire during a pro test against forced ev ictions, killing a m an and a 12-year-old boy. 
In a video shared on social media, police were seen beating the man after he was shot and a 
photographer hired by the local authorities stomping on  the 
body of the injured man. The victims were Bengali-speaking Muslims, a commu-nity the BJP gov ernment has fr equently vilified  as “
illegal Bangladeshis .” 
The authorities continued to use section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
which requires government approval to pro secute police officials, to block ac-
countability even in cases of serious abuses. In March, the Gujarat state govern-
ment refused to  give  perm ission  to prosecute three polic e officials accused in 
the 2004 extrajudicial killing of a Muslim woman, Ishrat Jahan. 
The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, which remained in effect in Jammu and 
Kashmir and several northeastern state s, provides effective immunity from pros-
ecution to security forces, even for serious human rights abuses . 
320WORLD REPORT 2022The Border Security Force  frequently used  excessive  force agains t irregular immi-
grants and cattle traders from Bangladesh. 
Dalits, Tribal Groups, and Religious Minorities  
Hindu mobs beat up Muslims, often working class men , with impunity while pro-
BJP supporters filed baseless complaints against critics, especially religious mi-
norities.  
In January, a Muslim stand-up comic, Munawar Faruqui , and five of his associ-
ates were arrested on a complaint br ought by the son of a BJP politician who ac-
cused him of hurting Hindu sentiments in jokes Faruqui apparently did not utter. Police subsequently admitted they had no evidence of the performance.  
In October, over 200 men and women allegedly belonging to the BJP youth wing 
and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Ba-jrang Dal 
attacked a church in Uttarakhand state , vandalizing property and injur-
ing several churchgoers. The attack came soon after the VHP allegedly 
threatened to demolish churches  in Madhya Pradesh state’s Jhabua district, 
claiming they were doing illegal religious conversions. Hindu nationalist groups also 
attacked churches in Chhattisgarh  state. Several states enacted  or 
amended laws ostensibly to prevent forc ed religious conversions, but these laws 
have been largely used to target minority  communities, particularly Christians, 
Muslims, Dalits, and  Adivasi s.  
In September, the National Crime Records Bureau reported  that 50,291 cases of 
crimes against Dalits were reported in 20 20, an increase of 9.4 percent over the 
previous year. Crimes against tribal c ommunities also increased by 9.3 percent, 
at 8,272 cases.  
Civil Society and Freedom of Association  
In July, the death of jailed tribal rights act ivist Stan Swamy, 84, was emblematic 
of the ongoing persecution of  rights act ivists. Swamy was arrested on politically 
motivated terrorism charges in the Bhima Koregaon case , related to caste vio-
lence in Maharashtra state in 2017. Fifteen other prominent human rights de-fenders are charged in this case. The 
UN special rapporteur on human rights 
321HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHdefenders  said  Swamy’s death “will forever remain a stain on India’s human 
rights record.”  
In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi  described people participating in var-
ious peaceful pro tests as “parasites.”  
Hundreds of thousands of  farmers, many of them from the minority Sikh commu-
nity, protesting amendments to farm laws since November 2020, were accused by BJP leaders and pro-government media of having a 
separatist agenda .  
Following violent clashes on January 26, 2021 between the police and protesting 
farmers in which one protest er died, the authorities filed baseless criminal cases 
against journalists , shut down the internet at multip le sites, prevented journal-
ists from entering protest sites, and order ed Twitter to block hundreds of ac-
counts. In February, the authorities arrested a climate act ivist, Disha Ravi , 
accusing her of sedition and criminal conspiracy for allegedly editing a docu-ment providing information on the protests, and issued warrants against two 
others. In March, 
several UN human rights experts  raised concerns over govern-
ment’s measures to restrict the protes ts, intimidate those invo lved, and stifle 
public debate about them. 
In October, police arrested the son of a BJP minister  on accusations that he ran 
over and killed four protesting farmers in Uttar Pradesh state with his car. An angry mob, in retaliation, then killed three men in the car, including the driver. A journalist also died in the violence. 
In September, government financial officials 
raided the home and office of Harsh 
Mander , an act ivist, in Delhi, alleging fin ancial and admini strative irr egularities. 
In July, the government restricted funding for 10 international nongovernmental 
organizations  working on climate change, envir onment or child labor, using the 
Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.  
In June, the Delhi High Court, while granting bail to three student leaders  ar-
rested on terrorism charges in relation to communal violence in Delhi in February 2020, said, “in its anxiety to suppress dissent, in the mind of the State, the line between the constitutionally guaranteed right to  protest and terrorist activity 
seems to be getting somewhat blurred.”  
322WORLD REPORT 2022UN human rights experts repeatedly raised concerns over misuse of counterter-
rorism laws to bring criminal charge s against human rights defenders. In April, 
UN rights experts wrot e to the Indian government  on the alleged arbitrary deten-
tion of Ad ivasi hum an rights defender Hidme Markam on t errorism charges, say-
ing the arrest appeared to be in response to her human rights work, and in particular her work to highlight instances  of sexual violence against women by 
state security forces. 
Freedom of Expression and Privacy Rights  
The authorities continued to intimidate and ha rass journalist s and news outlets 
critical of the government through politically motivated lawsuits and tax raids. In 
July, the Indian news website The Wire reported  that at least 300 Indian phone 
numbers, including those of human rights defenders, journalis ts, lawyers, gov-
ernment officials, and opposition politicians, we re included on a list of potential 
targets for advanced Israeli spyware Pegasus. Phone numbers of several ac-
tivists arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case, as we ll as some of their f amily mem-
bers were also on the leaked Pegasus list . In October, the Supreme Court, in 
response to several petitions related to the use of Pegasus spyware, appointed 
an independent panel  to investigate the allegations of illegal surveillance. 
In February, the government enacted the Information Techno logy (Intermediary 
Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 , which target internet in-
termediaries, including social medi a services, digital news services, and curated 
video streaming sites. While the government said they aimed to curb the spread of “fake news,” they allow greater go vernmental control over online content, 
threaten to weaken encryption, and would seriously 
undermine rights to privacy 
and freedom of expression online . In June, three UN human rights experts said  
the rules did not conform with international human rights norms. 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
The alleged rape and mu rder of a 9 -year old Dalit  girl in Delhi  in August once 
again spotlighted that Dalit women and  girls are at heightened risk of  sexual vio-
lence . In August, a 24-year-ol d woman and her male friend from Uttar Pradesh 
died after setting themselves on fire  in front of the Supreme Court, alleging ha-
323HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHrassment by state police and judiciary in retaliation for her rape comp laint 
against a member of parliament. 
In February, former BJP minister M.J. Akbar lost his defamation case against jour-
nalist Priya Ramani, who among several other women, had accused him of sex-ual harass ment in the workplace. The ru ling by a Delhi court, the 
first major legal 
victory in India’s #MeToo movement , noted that “a woman cannot be punished 
for raising her voice against sexual abu se.” However, the law addressing sexual 
violence in the workplace remained poorly enforced , especially for women in the 
informal sector. 
The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated existing challenges women faced in work-
force participation , pushing even more women out of  jobs and into poverty. 
Studies showed  more women than men lost jobs; a 2021 study  said 47 percent 
of women lost their jobs as compared to  7 percent of men during the first lock-
down in 2020, and they had not returned to work by the end of the year. In the informal sector, women fared even wo rse. Between March and April 2021, 
women in informal jobs in rural India accounted for 
80 percent of job losses . 
Children’s Rights during Covid-19 Pandemic  
By September 2021, several states in India began to reopen schools that had been shut for the most part since March  2020, affecting around 320 million chil-
dren in India. An August report by a 
parliamentary standing committee  noted 
that children’s learning had “suffer ed immensely and because education sector 
also provides help, nutrition and psychological  services, the overall welfare of 
the children has dec lined subst antially.” The report noted that  77 percent  of stu-
dents were depr ived of att ending online c lasse s, while 40 percent  of students 
had not accessed any remote learning.   
A February study by Azim Premji University  covering approximately 16,000 stu-
dents across grade 2 to 6 in five states found significant learning losses. Another 
report  led by some economists found devastating impact of school closures on 
children’s le arning, especially in r ural areas and in poor and ma rginaliz ed 
households.  
School disruptions accompanied  by declines in earnings and loss of jobs, partic-
ularly in marginalized communities, resul ted in an increase in child labor, early 
324WORLD REPORT 2022marriage , and trafficking. A UNICEF report  said about 10 million students are at 
risk of never returning to school.  
Disability Rights  
Disability rights groups welcomed tw o court judgments recognizing barriers to 
justice for persons with di sabilities and calling for an end to abuses in mental 
health institutions. In September, the Supreme Court recognized that the rights of people with disabilities in mental hospitals are being violated and called on the government to monitor state-run ins titutions more closely. It also 
ordered  
states to make Covid-19 vaccinations available to everyone detained in a mental health facility and to the staff. In April, the 
Supreme Court  issued a ruling, echo-
ing calls from the Indian disability rights movement to make concrete reforms  to 
make the criminal justice system more accessible for people with disabilities.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
In June, the Madras High Cour t issued  guidelines  for the safety of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, tr ansgender, queer, and interse x persons and for prevention of harass-
ment by the state authorities. The ruling recognized widespread discrimination and also recommended several measures towards addressing prejudices against them in society, including through training and sensitization programs for police 
and judiciary.  
In January, the Delhi Commiss ion for Protection of Child Rights  recommended a 
ban on medically unnecessary “normalizing” surgeries  on children born with in-
tersex variations. In August, a rights group filed a public interest litigation in 
Delhi High Court  asking the Delhi government to declare a ban, citing the state’s 
child rights agency’s stance on the matter. 
Key International Actors  
In April, the European Union held a local human rights dialogue with India . To 
date, the EU’s for eign policy br anch has re frained from publicly exp ressing con-
cerns over India’s human rights record, as have EU leaders during a summit  with 
their Indian counterparts in May. The Eur opean parliament remains the only EU 
325HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHbody that raised concerns on human rights in India, including in a recommenda-
tion adopted in April.   
In September, India and Australia held  the inaugural 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue 
where they discussed cooperation on cyber and critical technology  and called for 
international counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan . 
In September, Prime Minister Modi attended the first in-person Quad summit  in 
Washington, DC with leaders of Japan, A ustralia, and the United States. The 
leaders reiterated their c ommitment for a free and open Indo-Pacific, with an eye 
on China, and boosting global vaccine supply. The US deputy secretary of state 
visited Delhi  in October to discuss India’s security concerns with the spillover ef-
fects from the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.  
Foreign Policy  
Following the military coup in Myanmar in February, even as India condemned the violence and called for the release of detained leaders, it 
abstained on a UN 
General Assembly resolution  in June that called for the release of those arbitrar-
ily detained, stopping the flow of arms int o the country, and the Myanmar mili-
tary to respect the outcome of the 2020 election.  
In August, under India’s month-long presidency, the UN Security Council 
adopted a resolution on Afghanistan that ca lled on the Taliban to ensure safe 
passage for Afghan nationals who want to leave the country, allow humanitarian 
access, and uphold human rights. India, r eflecting Pakistan’s ties to the Taliban, 
pushed for commitments from the Taliban to  ensure the country is not used by 
extremist groups to carry out att acks on India. In August, the Indian ambassador 
to Qatar met the head of the Taliban’s political office  in Doha.  
India did not raise rights protections  publicly with other neighbors including 
Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. 
India gifted 10.7 million vaccines to 47 countries , commercially exported 35.7 
million vaccines to 26 countries, and su pplied 19.8 million vaccines to Covax, 
the global vaccine initiative that procures and distributes vaccines to low-and 
middle-income countries. Covax is largely supplied by AstraZeneca, which in turn 
has r elied on only  one manufacturing partner in India, the Serum Institute.  
326WORLD REPORT 2022As India struggled with a huge surge in deaths and infections with the second 
wave of Covid-19, the government halted  all vaccine exports, causing shortages 
in countries that depended on Covax. In September, the government said it would 
restart the exports , including to Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Maldives.

Covid-19 cases surged in Indonesia in mid-2021, prompting the government to 
lock down most of Java, Bali, and many  other parts of the archipelago in July and 
August. At time of writing, the government had confirmed  more than 4.2 million 
cases and 142,000 deaths. Because many people self-isolated and did not re-port their symptoms or seek testing, public health researchers believe the actual death toll is much higher.

Eradication Comm ission, screening its  employees and 
later firing 57 staff , includ-
ing some leading investigators. The p resident’s ruling coalition also continued 
to push through a new criminal code with many rights-violating articles.  
Religious minorities continue to suffer from di scriminatory regulations , including 
the 1965 blasphemy law and  the so-called r eligious harmon y regul ation that 
makes it difficult for minorities in this predominantly Sunni Muslim country to build houses of worship, including non-Sunni minorities (Ahmadiyah, Shia) as 
well as non-Muslim minorities (Christians, Hindu s, Buddhists, and Confucians, 
as well as followers of local religions such as Sunda Wiwitan).  
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
On May 3, a panel of three male judges at  the Supreme Court ruled that a new 
government regulation  issued in February, which allowed millions of girls and 
women in thousands of state schools  a basic freedom—to choose whether or not 
to wear a jilbab  (Muslim apparel that covers  the head, neck, and chest)—had 
“violated four national laws.” The ruling st ated that children under 18 have no 
right to choose their clothes. 
The government adopted the r egulation after a father in Padang, West Sumatra, 
publicized his daughter being forced to wear a jilbab. A Human Rights Watch re-port documented widespread bullying of  girls and women into wearing a jilbab, 
and the deep psychological distress it c an cause. Girls who do not comply have 
been forced to leav e school or withdraw under pressur e, while fem ale civil ser-
vants, including teachers and university lecturers, have lost their jobs or re-signed. Many Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and other non-Muslim students and 
329HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHteachers have also been forced to wear the jilbab. Human Rights Watch is aware 
of at least 64 mandatory jilbab regulations in Indonesia.  
In July, Army Chief Gen. Andika Perkasa told army commanders that the required 
medical check-up in the recruitment proce ss for female officers should be similar 
to the check-up u sed for male officers, ending the abu sive and u nscientific “vir-
ginity test.”  Applicants should be assessed only on their ability to take part in 
physical training, he said. He also clarified that male army personnel seeking army permission to  get married  should no longer be required to submit medical 
check-ups for their fiancées. 
Freedom of Religion  
In June, members of Nahdlatul Ulama protested the construction of a Muham-
madiyah mosque  in Banyuwangi, prompting the local government to stop con-
struction, invoking the 2006 religious harmony regulation. The two Sunni groups 
are Indonesia’s two largest Muslim organizations. 
In August, the National Police separately arrested and detained two clergymen 
on blasphemy charges. Muhammad Kece, a Christian preacher, was arrested for alleged blasphem y against Islam; Ya hya Waloni, a Muslim im am, was arrested at 
his Jakarta  house after alleged ly saying in a sermon that the Bib le was fa ke.  
On September 3, more than 200 ethnic Malay men 
attacked  an Ahmadiyah 
mosque in Sintang, West Kalimantan. Po lice arrested 22, charging them with 
arson and destruction of private property. Governor Sutarmidji supported the Muslim militants, meeting their two top leaders, cleric Mohammad Hedi and po-
litical operative Zainudin, in the detention center. Sutarmidji later asked the Sin-tang government to demolish the Ahmadiyah mosque. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
On January 28, 2021, authorities in Aceh province publicly flogged two gay men 
77 times each  after a vigilante mob raided their apartment the previous Novem-
ber, allegedly caught them having sex, and handed them over to the police.  
330WORLD REPORT 2022The Jakarta-b ased LGBT grou p Arus Pe langi has identified  45 anti-LGBT regula-
tions in Indonesia, including the 2008 Anti-Pornography Law that categorizes homosexuality as “deviant sex.”  
In Semarang, policeman Tri Teguh Pujianto is challenging his 2018 dismissal 
from the Central Java Police because of his sexual orientation. He filed his case 
in March 2019. A 
documentary  entitled “Teguh,” me aning “firm,” was pr oduced 
supporting his case. In September, the Medan district court granted a transgen-
der man  permiss ion to legally  change his name to match  his identity.  
Land Rights  
The Indonesian government is failing to prot ect the rights of communities living 
on or near land allotted to commercial agriculture. Due to minimal ongoing moni-toring and oversight, some of these plantations degrade the 
environment  they 
operate in and, in some cases, cause almost  irreparable damage to peatlands, 
one of the world’s most important carbon sinks. 
PT Sintang Raya, a subs idiary of South Kore an Daesang Corpor ation, has estab-
lished and expanded  its plantations in peatlands in three tidal villages in West 
Kalimantan without genuine consultation with local residents and without ade-quate compensation for loss of their farmland or livelihoods.  
West Papua  
Sporadic fighting between Indonesian security forces and the West Papua Na-
tional Liberation Army continued in the central highlands area, killing at least 25 
civilians  in 2021, including Reverend Yer emia Zanambani, who had translated 
the Bible into the Nduga language.  
On May 9, Indonesian police arrested Victor Yeimo , a spokesman for the West 
Papua National Committee, in Jayapura. Po lice charged him with treason for a 
2019 statement made during anti-racism protests and ensuing riots in Papua and West Papua calling for a referendum on independence.

RIGHTS   WATCH  Climate Change Policy and Impacts 
Indonesia, one of the world’s top 10  emitters of greenhouse gases, is contribut-
ing to the climate crisis tak ing a mounting to ll on human rights arou nd the 
globe. In its 2021 update  to its national climate action plan, Indonesia reiterated  
its 2016  goals, rather than establishing more ambitious targets as required by 
the Paris Agreement. Its climate plan is “critically insufficient” to meet the agree-
ment’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C  above pre-industrial levels, accord-
ing to The Climate Action Tracker . If all countries’ commitments were in this 
range, the global temperature increase would exceed 4°C by the end of the cen-tury. 
Government data released in March suggests 
deforestation dropped signifi-
cantly  between 2019 and 2020. Alternative estimates  by Global Fo rest Watch 
(GFW) confirm a downward trend. In Sept ember, a government-mandated mora-
torium on new oil palm  plantations lapsed . Despite an official ban on primary 
forest clearing  in force since 2011, the latest GFW data  indicates Indonesia lost 
250,000 hectares in 2020. In November 2021, at the global climate summit in Glasgow, the Indonesian government signed a global pledge to end forest loss by 2030 – but its environment minister 
promptly criticized  the pledge and vowed 
to continue clearing forests as part of ‘development’ plans. 
Indonesia has taken f ew steps to move away from reliance on coal  for elect ricity 
generation, a major c ontributor to greenhouse gas emiss ions. In May, the gov-
ernment said  it would build more coal-fired power stations  but would shut them 
all down in 2060. Indonesia could prevent  tens of thousands of premature 
deaths linked to air pollution  by rapidly reducing  its reliance on coal-fired elec-
tricity.  
Floods, droughts, sea level rise, changes in rainfall patterns, and warmer tem-
peratures induced by climate change are expected to take a toll, requiring In-
donesia to take steps to protect at-risk populations from their foreseeable harms
. In January 2021, South Kalimantan and Borneo declared  a state of 
emergency after heavy rainfall and flooding displaced tens of thousands. 
333HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHKey International Actors 
US President Joe Biden said in a speech  in Washington, DC, on July 27: “What 
happens in Indonesia if the projections are correct that, in the next 10 years, 
they may have to move the capital because they will be underwater? That’s im-portant. It’s a strategic question as well as an environmental question.” The In-
donesian government is 
finalizing a plan  to move the capital from Jakarta to 
North Penajam Paser in Kalimantan, estimating 15 to 20 years for the relocation. 
On September 17 , UN Secretary-General Ant ónio Guterres wrote in his annual re-
port that between May 2020 and April 2021, five individuals in Indonesia seek-ing to cooperate with UN human rights agencies—Wensislaus Fatubun, Yones Douw, Victor Mambor, Veronica Kom an, and Victor Yeimo—were “subject to 
threats, ha rassment and surveillance by government, non-st ate and pr ivate ac-
tors, including business enterprises and local political actors.” 
Indonesia played a role in 
excluding Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing  from 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit on October 26-28. ASEAN said that a lack of progress on a peace roadmap that the junta had agreed on in April has pr ompted the grou p to exclude the ju nta. The mo ve was 
unprecedented, as ASEAN usually  works with compromises.  
334WORLD REPORT 2022Iran  
Iranian authorities continued their crackdown on peaceful dissent, prosecuting 
human rights defenders and diss idents while serious human rights  violators en-
joyed impunity.   
Ebrahim Raeesi, who became president in unfree and unfair elections in June, 
previously oversaw the coun try’s abusive  judiciary and  is accused of overseeing 
the mass extr ajudicial execution of  political prisoners in 1988.  
Deteriorating economic conditions due to US unilateral sanctions and the impact 
of the Covid-19 pandemic have increased poverty and reduced living standards 
for millions in Iran. The government’s res ponse to the pandemic, especially its 
mismanaged  national vaccine procurement plan, has been criticiz ed for its  opac-
ity and politicization.  
Freedom of Assembly and Expression, Right to Participate in 
the Conduct of Public Affairs  
Iranian authorities severely restricted freedoms  of assembly and expression. 
Over the past three years, security forces  have responded to widespread protests stemming from economic  rights issues with excessive and unlawful 
force, including lethal force, and have arrested thousands of protestors.  
On February 16, authorities arreste d photojournalist Noushin Jafari and trans-
ferred her to Qarchak prison to serve a revolutionary court sentence for charges 
of “spreading propagand a against the state” and “insulting the sanctities.” Jour-
nalists and media act ivists curr ently in prison include Keyvan Samimi and Ali-
ayeh Matlabzadeh, the chair and co-chair of the local nongovernmental organization (NGO) the  Society  for Defending Press Freedom . Both have been 
sentenced to impri sonment for their peaceful activis m.  
On February 22, according to the Baluchi Act ivists C ampaign, Iran’s  Islamic Rev-
olutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) blocked the roa d residents used to transport fuel 
to Pakistan at the Eskan border area in the town of Saravan, in Sistan and Baluchistan province. The security forc es then apparently opened fire at those 
attempting to open the road, killing at least 10 people.  
335HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn June 19, Ebrahim Raeesi, former head of Iran’s judiciary, became president 
after unfree and unfair elections. In the period before the election, the Guardian 
Council, a body of 12 male religious jurists and legal experts tasked with vetting elections, disqualified many candidates without providing a reason, including several prominent gov ernment officials. Raeesi, who has had a car eer for over 
three decades in the judiciary, reportedly served on a committee that decided the fate of prisoners in 1988, when the Iranian government summarily and extra-judicially executed thousands of political  prisoners held in Iranian jails, in what 
amounted to crimes against humanity. 
On July 15, people in dozens of towns  and cities in Khuzestan and Lorestan 
provinces, which have a large ethnic Arab minority population, took to the streets for several nights to protest not having clean water for days. Human rights groups have verified the identities of at least nine people who were shot dead or died  of injuries du ring the protests, including a 17 -year-old bo y. Videos 
shared on social media from protests in cities in Khuzestan show security offi-
cials s hooting firearms  and tear gas toward protesters. 
Iran’s parli ament has been working on a draft bill th at seeks to impose further 
restrictions on internet  access for people in Iran. The bill includes a provision re-
quiring international technology c ompanies to have a legal representative in Iran 
to comply with Iranian law and  cooperate with authorities. Iranian authorities 
have long surveilled users and prosec uted them for views they expressed online 
and censored online spaces. The bill also seeks to criminalize production and distribution of censorship circumvention tools (VPNs) commonly used in Iran to access a wide range of websites that are blocked by authorities.  
Human Rights Defenders a nd Civil Society Activists  
Scores of human rights defenders remain behind bars while authorities continue 
to harass, arrest, and prosecute those seek ing accountability and justice, includ-
ing human rights lawyers Nasrin Sot oudeh, Mohamad Najafi, and Amirsalar 
Davoudi.  
On August 14, Iranian authorities arrested six  prominent human rights lawyers 
and act ivists w orking on filing a compl aint against Iranian authorities for their 
abject mism anagement of  the Covid-19 crisi s. As of Novem ber 8, they continued 
336WORLD REPORT 2022to detain three of them: Arash Keykhosravi, Mostafa Nili, and Mehdi Mah-
moudian. Mahmoudian’s lawyer said that authorities are implementing a four-
year prison sentence his client previousl y received for his human rights activis m.  
On September 26, prominent human rights  defender Narges Mohammadi an-
nounced that authorities summoned her to serve a 30-month prison sentence for charges including “signing a lett er opposing the death penalty,” “staging a sit-in 
at the prison office,” “refusing order (to end the sit in),” and “property damage.” Authorities previously released Moh ammadi on October 5, 2020, after she 
served five years in pri son for her rights  activis m.  
Since the IRGC’s downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 in January 
2020 that kil led 176 people, authoritie s have harassed the families of  victims 
and restricted their rights to seek truth and justice.  
In July, an Iranian court 
sentenced  Manoucher Bakhtiari, the father of Pouya 
Bakhtiari, 27 , who was fatally shot du ring the crackdown on protesters in Novem-
ber 2019, to three and a half years in prison and two and a half years in internal exile to a remote area  on unclear charges.  
Seven members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, a local NGO focused 
on preserving biodiversity, 
remained behind bars  on the charge of “collaborating 
with the hostile state of the US.” Iranian authorities have failed to produce any 
evidence to support their charges nor have they investigated allegations of tor-
ture against them. 
Execution, Right to Life  
Iran continues to be one of the w orld’s leading implementers of the death 
penalty. According to rights groups, in 2021 Iran had executed at least 254 peo-ple as of November 8, including at l east seven people on al leged terrorism-re-
lated charges.  
The judiciary also executed at least one individual sentenced to death for crimes 
they allegedly committed as a child. Under Iran’s current penal code, judges can use their discretion not to sentence to  death individuals who committed their al-
leged crime as children. However, several individuals who were retried under the 
337HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHpenal code for crimes they allegedly committed as children have then been sen-
tenced to death again. 
Iranian law considers acts such as “insulting the prophet,” “apostasy,” same-
sex relations, adultery, drinking alcohol, and  certain non-violent drug-related of-
fenses as crimes punishable by death. The law also prescribes the inhumane punishment of flogging for more th an 100 offenses, including “disrupting public 
order,” a charge th at has been used to sentence ind ividuals to flogging for their 
participation in protests. 
More than two years after a brutal crackdo wn against widespread protests in No-
vember 2019, authorities have failed to conduct any transparent investigation 
into the use of ex cessive and unla wful force against protestors.  
Iranian authorities’ criminal investig ation into the January 2020 shooting down 
of the Ukrainian pl ane has been handled by the judicial org anization of the 
armed forces and remains shrouded in secrecy, with families of victims receiving very few details. On August 31, the associ ation of families of flight PS752 said 
that they received a government notification that the military prosecutor’s office 
had indicted 10 officials, ranging from a commander of a Tor M1 air defense mis-sile system to operators deemed “worthy of punishment” for charges that in-
clude participating in unintentional murder, negligence, imprudence, and not following the protocol. 
Covid-19 Vaccine Access  
Authorities’ prohibition on procuring US and UK-produced vaccines, lack of 
transparency, and mismanagement exacerb ated the already devastating impact 
of Covid-19 in Iran, with an official death toll at 127 ,299 as of November 8. 
In January, Ayatollah Khamenei placed a ban on the import of US and UK-pro-
duced vaccines. It appeared that  authorities also sought to prioritize domestic 
production but fell behind in delivering promised quotas. Faced with widespread criticis m, authorities have said that the ban has been reversed. The pace of na-
tional vaccin ation has picked up since mid-August. Accor ding to officia l statis-
tics, as of November 8, more than 46 percent of the population had received two doses of Covid-19 vaccines.  
338WORLD REPORT 2022Due Process Rights, Fair Tria l Standards, and Prison 
Conditions  
Iranian courts, and particularly revolutionary courts, regularly fall far short of 
providing fair trials and use confessions likely obtained under torture as evi-dence in court. Authorities have failed to meaningfully investigate numerous al-
legations of torture against detainee s. Authorities routinely restrict detainees’ 
access to legal counsel, particularly during the initial investigation period. 
The IRGC’s Intelligence Organization continues to  arrest Iranian dual and foreign 
nationals on vague charges, such as “cooperating with a hostile state.”  
There have been numerous reports of  suspicious deaths in Iranian prisons, 
which authorities have failed to properly in vestigate. According to Amnesty Inter-
national, in 2010 at least 72 people had died in custody in Iranian prisons, while authorities have failed to provide accountability despite credible reports of tor-ture and ill-treatment. Moreover, over the past year, there have been at least two reported deaths of prisoners, with fami lies alleging that delayed or improper 
medical care contributed to their deaths. In many cases, Iranian authorities have restricted access of prisoners to medical care, particularly outside prison.  
On March 1, a group of formerly impri soned political  activis ts and h uman rights 
defenders filed a compl aint against the authorities use of prolonged solitary 
confinement in Iranian prisons, particularly for vaguely defined national security crimes.  
Women’s Rights, Children’s Rig hts, Sexual Orientation, and 
Gender Identity 
Women face discrimination in personal status matters related to marriage, di-
vorce, inheritance, and  decisions re lating to children. Under the Pass ports Law, 
a married woman may not obtain a passport or travel outside the country without the written perm ission of her husband who can revoke  such permission at any 
time. Under the civil c ode, a husband is accorded the right to c hoose the place 
of living and can prevent his wife from having certain occupations if he deems them against “family values.” Iranian law allows  girls to marry at 13 and boys at 
age 15, as well as at younger ages if authorized by a judge. 
339HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAt least five activists  are currently  behind bars f or their peaceful protests against 
compulsory hijab laws.  
While cases of f emicide are incr easingly reporte d in media and social media, 
Iran has no la w on domestic violence to  prevent abu se and prot ect survivo rs. On 
January 3, the cabinet approved the draft bill on violence against women. While 
a step forward in providing legal definitions surrounding violence against 
women and measures  to support victims, the bi ll lacks p rovisions f or crimin aliz-
ing marital rape and child marriage. With the change in the administration, it is unclear whether the bill will be introduced  to parliament for a vote.  
Iran’s criminal law exempts parents and guardians from penalty for inflicting cor-
poral punishment “w ithin the customary  limit.”  
On November 1, the Guardian Council p assed the “rejuvenation of the popula-
tion and support of family” bill that offer s numerous incentives for childbearing 
and seeks to further limit access to contraception and abortion.  
The draft bill outlaws voluntary sterilization and free distribution of contracep-
tives in the public health care system unl ess pregnancy threatens the woman’s 
health. The draft law also mandates the Health Ministry to establish a committee that includes doctors, Islamic jurists, and representatives of the judiciary and 
the parliamentary health committee to draft new bylaws for abortion that could lead to further restrictions on access to abortion.  
Under the current law, abortion can be legally performed during the first four 
months of pregnancy if three doctors agr ee that the pregnancy threatens a 
woman’s life or the fetus has severely physica l or mental deformitie s that would 
create “extreme hardship” for the mother. In October, a letter, issued by the 
crime prevention deputy at the judiciary in Iran’s Mazandaran province, was leaked on Twitter mandating local laborat ories to report on women with positive 
pregnancy tests to prevent “criminal abortions.” 
Under Iranian law, extramarital sex is criminalized with flogging if the person is 
unmarried or death if married, impacting women in particular as pregnancy serves as evidence of sexual relations and women who report sexual violence 
can find themselves prosecuted if authorities believe it to be consensual. Same-
sex conduct is also punishable by flogging and, for men, the death penalty. Al-
340WORLD REPORT 2022though Iran permits and  subsidizes se x reass ignment sur gery for transgender 
people, no law prohibits discrimination against them. 
Treatment of Minorities, Refugees, and Migrants  
Iranian law denies freedom of religion to Baha’is and discriminates against 
them. Authorities continue to arrest and prosec ute members of the Baha’i faith 
on vague national security charges and to close businesses owned by them. 
Iranian authorities also systematically refuse to  allow Baha’is to register at pub-
lic universities because of their faith.   
The government also discriminates against other religiou s minorities, including 
Sunni Muslims, and restricts cul tural and po litical activities among the country’s 
Azeri, Kurdish, Arab , and Baluch ethnic minorities. Minority  activis ts are regu-
larly arrested and prosecuted on vaguely defined national security charges in tri-
als that grossly fall short of international standards. 
It appears that over the past year, authorities have increased the crackdown 
against Kurdish politic al activis ts. On September 9, IRGC forc es launched  missi le 
attacks against the bases of Kurdish opposition forces (Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran or KDPI) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  
Iran hosts a long-staying population of about 780,000 registered Afghan 
refugees and another estimated 850 ,000 undocumented Afghans. In mid-Au-
gust, the government set up 
three temporary tent camps  for refugees fleeing 
Afghanistan, but its border remained closed to most Afghan asylum seekers, as entry was limited to people with valid pass ports and visa s. During Sept ember, 
about 2,000 Afghans per day were estimated  to enter Iran irregularly, but a com-
parable number of Afghans were deported from Iran. 
Right to Water and Impact of Climate Change  
As one of the world’s top 10 emitters of greenhouse gases, Iran is contributing to 
the climate cr isis tak ing a mounting to ll on human rights arou nd the globe. Most 
of its emissions are from the energy sector: 94 percent of Iran’s electricity comes 
from fossil fuels. Iran is the eighth largest  producer of crude oil and the third 
largest producer of  natural gas but al so has s ignificant renew able energy poten-
341HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtial. Energy costs are heavily subsidiz ed, one of the factors leading to a high en-
ergy intensity  per capita. Iran has taken f ew steps to reduce reliance on fossil 
fuels, regularly citing international sanctions as a barrier to transitioning to-
wards cleaner energy. Iran is one of six countries that has not yet ratified the 
Paris Agreement.  
There are longstanding concerns across Iran, and Khuzestan in particular, over 
mismanagement of water resources and pollution from oil development. For 
decades, environmental experts  have warned  that development projects in oil-
rich Khuzestan, including the construction of hydroelectric dams, irrigation 
schemes, and water transfer s to neighboring provinces are causing environmen-
tal harm and leading to water shortages affecting a range of rights. 
Climate change is a serious threat to Iranian livelihood s including from in-
creased temperatures, more frequent and  intense forest fires, dust storms, in-
land flooding, and sea level rise. In 2021, droughts exacerbated long-standing pressures on water re sources. The incr easing fr equency and int ensity of 
droughts is projected to c ontinue, diminishing agricul tural pr oductivity compro-
mising food security.  
Key International Actors  
While several rounds of indirect negotiations have taken place between Iran and 
the US for a return to compliance w ith the 2015 Joint Comprehen sive Plan of  Ac-
tion (JCPOA), the US has m aintained its  broad sectoral ec onomic and financial 
sanctions on Iran. A lthough the US government  has built exemptions f or human-
itarian imports into its sanctions regime, Human Rights Watch found that in practice US and Eu ropean companies and  banks c ontinue to refrain from export-
ing or financing exempted humanitarian goods and services for fear of legal ac-tion and sanctions from the US government.   
On June 17 , the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC) issued an additional general license that expanded an existing humani-tarian exemption to transactions and activities involving the delivery of face masks, ventilators and oxygen tanks, vaccines and the production of vaccines, Covid-19 tests, air filtration systems, and Co vid-19-related field hospitals, among 
others.  
342WORLD REPORT 2022On July 27 , Swedish pro secutors announc ed their de cision to prosecute an Iran-
ian citizen for “committing grave war crimes and murder in Iran during 1988.” The trial opened on August 10 and is expected to last through April 2022.  
343HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIraq 
In 2021, the government failed to deliver on its promises to hold to account 
those responsible for the arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and extra-
judicial killing s of protesters, activis ts, journalists, and others open ly critic al of 
political and armed groups in the country. 
Iraq’s c riminal justice system was still marr ed by the wid espread use of  torture, 
including in order to extract confess ions. Despite serious due process violations 
in trials, authorities carried out at least 19  judicial executions of defendants sen-
tenced to death.  
No ISIS defendants  have been convicted of international crimes such as war 
crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide. In March Iraq’s parliament 
passed  the Law on Yazidi Fe male Survivor s, which recogniz ed crimes committed 
by ISIS against women and girls from the Yezidi, Turkman, Christian, and 
Shabaks minorities as genocide and crimes against humanity, but little progress 
has been made  towards applying the law. 
In a brazen attack on November 7 , unnamed armed actors tried but failed to as-
sassinate the prime minister in h is home us ing three armed drones.  
Accountability for Abuses against Critics  
During protests that began in October 2019 and continued 
into late 2020,  clashes  with security forces, including the Popular Mobilization 
Forces (PMF or  hashad ) nominally under the control of the prime minister, left at 
least 560 protesters and security forces dead in Baghdad and Iraq’s southern cities. In May 2020, when Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office, he formed a committee to inves tigate the killings of protesters. It had yet 
to announce any findings as of September 2021. 
In July 2020, the government 
announced  it would compensate the families of 
those killed during the protests. As of Sept ember 2021, the six families of ac-
tivists killed  whom Human Rights Watch  contacted had not received any com-
pensation. In February 2021, the government announced the arrest  of members 
of a “ death squad ” that had allegedly been responsible for killing at least three 
344WORLD REPORT 2022activis ts in the southern city  of Basra. B aghdad authoritie s announced in July 
that they had arrested three low-level security forces officers linked to abuses against protesters, and 
one man  allegedly responsible for the 2020 killing of po-
litical analyst Hisham Al-Hashimi.  
A United Nations  Assist ance M ission to Iraq (UNAMI) report  published in May 
found that not one of several arrests related to targeted killings appeared to have moved beyond the investigative pha se. As of late September, it appeared 
that none of the arrests had led to any charges being brought.  
Torture, Fair Trial Viol ations, and the Death Penalty  
UNAMI released a report  in August based on interviews with more than 200 de-
tainees, over half of whom shared credible allegations of torture. The report found that the authorities acquiesce in and toler ate the use of torture to extract 
confessions, a finding consistent with Human Rights Watch 
reporting on the sys-
temic  use of torture  in Iraq. 
Criminal trials of defendants charged under Iraq’s overbroad terrorism law, most 
often for alleged membership in the Islamic  State (ISIS), were generally rushed 
and did not involve victim participation. Convictions were based primarily on confessions including tho se apparently extracted through torture. 
Authorities systematically 
violated the due process rights  of suspects, such as 
guarantees under Iraqi law that detainees see a judge within 24 hours, have ac-cess to a lawyer throughout interr ogations, and that their families are notified 
and be able to communicate with them.  
Based on the criminal age of responsibility in the penal code, 
authorities can prosecute child suspects as yo ung as 9 on terrorism charges in 
Baghdad-control led areas and 11 in the Kurdis tan Region of  Iraq. This violates in-
ternational standards, which recognize chi ldren recruited by armed groups pri-
marily as victims who should be reha bilitated and r eintegrated into 
society, and call for a minimum age of criminal responsibility of 14 years. 
According to a Ministry of Justice 
statement in September, authorities were de-

Many defendants were detained  because their names appeared on wanted lists 
of questionable accuracy or because they were family members of listed sus-
pects.  
In the Kurdistan R egion, the Kurdistan Regional  government (KRG)  has main-
tained a de facto  moratorium  on the death penalty since 2008, banning it “ex-
cept in very few cases which were considered essential,” according to a KRG 
spokesperson.  
ISIS Crimes Against the Yezidi Community  
Despite ISIS’s systematic rape, sexual slavery, and forced marriage of Yezidi women and girls, prosecut ors neglected to charge ISIS suspects with rape—
which carries a sentence of up to 15 years—even in cases where defendants ad-
mitted to subjecting Yezidis to sexual slavery. Instead, Iraqi judges routinely prosecuted IS IS suspects solely on the 
overbroad charge  of ISIS affilia-
tion.  No ISIS defendants  have been convicted of international crimes such as 
war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide, despite the apparent geno-
cide by ISIS against the Yezidis. 
On March 1, 2021, Iraq’s parliament passed  the Law on Yazidi Female Sur-
vivor s, which recognized  crimes committed by ISIS including kidn apping, sex-
ual enslavement, forced marri age, pregnancy, and abortion against women 
and girls from the Yezidi, Turkman, C hristian, and Shabaks minorities as geno-
cide and crimes against humanity. The law provides for compensation for sur-
vivors, as well as m easures for their rehabilitation and r eintegration int o society 
and the prevention of such crimes in the future. In September 2021, the parlia-
ment passed  the necessary regulations to implement the law but by November, 
little progress had been made  towards applying the law.  
Collective Punishment   
In March 2020, the government endorsed a  National Plan to Address Displace-
ment in Iraq  calling for a thought ful and sust ainable approach to assis ting Iraq’s 
346WORLD REPORT 2022protracted displaced population. However, the government closed  16 camps be-
tween October 2020 and January 2021, leaving at least 34,801 displaced people without assurances that they could return home safely, get other safe shelter, or have access to affordable services. Many residents were female-headed house-holds displaced by fighting between ISIS and the Iraqi military from 2014 to 
2017 , and many of these familie s were being labeled ISIS-affiliated. 
Only three camps remain open in Baghdad-c ontrolled territory, two in Nineveh 
and another in Anbar. 
In July, the 
Iraqi  army unlawfully  evicted 91 families fr om a village in Salah al-Din 
to one of the Nineveh camps in an apparent family feud  involving a government 
minister. 
In 2021, security forces continued to deny sec urity clearances, required to obtain 
identity cards and  other essential civil document ation, to thousand s of Iraqi 
families the authorities perceived to have IS IS affiliation, usually based on accu-
sations that an immediate family mem ber of theirs had joined the group. 
This denied them freedom of movement, their rights to education and work, and access to social benefits and birth and death certificates needed to in-herit property or remarry.  
Authorities continued to 
prevent  thousands of childr en without civil documenta-
tion from enrolling in state scho ols, including state schools inside camps for dis-
placed people. 
The government allowed some families to obtain  security clearances  if they filed 
a criminal complaint disavowing any relative suspected of having joined ISIS, after which the court issues them a doc ument to present to security 
forces enabling them to obtain their security clearances. 
At least 30,000 Iraqis who fled Iraq between 2014 and 2017 , including some who 
followed ISIS as it retreated from Ir aqi territory, were held in and around al-Hol 
camp in northeast Syria. In May, the Iraqi government r epatriated 
95 Iraqi fami-
lies from al-Hol and in September at least another 20 families . Authorities have 
prevented some of them from leaving the camp freely, retaining cell phones, or 
returning home.  
The KRG continued to prevent thousands of  Arabs from returning home to vil-
lages in the Rabia  subdistrict and  Hamdaniya  district, areas where KRG forces

Elections  
On October 10, Iraqis voted f or a new parliament with a voter turnout  of 36 per-
cent. Prominent Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr’s movement secured  the largest 
number of seats in peaceful elections. 
People With Disabilities  
Iraq failed to secure  political rights, in particular the right to vote, for Iraqis with 
disabilities. People with disabilities ar e often effectively denied their right to 
vote due to discriminatory legislation that strips the right to vote or run for office for people considered not “fully compet ent” under the law, inaccessible polling 
places, and legislative and political ob stacles, like requir ements for a certain 
level of education that many people with disabilities are unable to attain. In 2019, the UN’s Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that Iraq, plagued by decades of violence and  war, including the battles against ISIS 
from 2014-2017 ,  has one of the world’s 
largest  populations of people with dis-
abilities. 
KRG Prosecution of Critics  
In 2021, the Erbil Criminal Court sentenced three journalists  and two activists to 
six years in prison, based on proceedings marred by serious fair trial violations as well as high-level political interferenc e. The court rejected the defendants’ 
claims of torture and ill-treatment, citing a lack of evidence. Another journalist was 
sentenced to one year for misuse of his cell phone and defamation charges 
in June and Sept ember. Another four activis ts and jour nalists arrested in 2020 
were awaiting  charge as of October 2021. 
349HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen’s Rights, Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, Morality 
Laws   
While Iraq’s penal code criminalizes physica l assault, Article 41(1) allows a hus-
band to “punish” his wife and par ents to discipline their children “within limits 
prescribed by law or custom.” UNICEF surveys have found more than 80 percent of children are 
subjected  to violent discipline. The penal code also provides for 
mitigated sentences for violent acts, including murder, for “honorable motives,” 
and catching one’s wife or female relative in the act of adultery or sex outside of marriage. 
Such discriminatory laws expose women to  violence. Cases of domestic violence 
were 
reported  throughout 2021, including  killings  of women  and girls by their 
husbands or families .  
Parliamentary efforts  to pass a draft law ag ainst domestic violence has 
stalled since 2019. The 2019 version seen by Human Rights Watch included provis ions for services f or domestic violence survivors, restrain-
ing orders, penalties for their breach, and establishment of a cross-ministerial 
committee to combat domestic violence. The bill had several gaps and provi-
sions that would undermine its effectiveness, such as prioritizing reconcilia-tion over protection and justice for victims.  
In 2021, Iraqi security forces arbitrarily arrested lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans-
gender (LGBT) people based solely on their gender non-conforming appearance, and subjected them to ill-treatment including torture, forced anal exams, severe beatings, and sexual violence, in police cust ody. Security forces also physically, 
verbally and sexually harassed peop le they perceived as LGBT at checkpoints. 
Human Rights Watch documented cases of  digital surveillance by armed groups 
against LGBT people on social media and same-sex d ating applications. The gov-
ernment has failed to hold accountable members of armed  groups who have ab-
ducted, raped, tortured, and killed LGBT Iraqis with impunity.  
Article 394 of Iraq’s penal code makes it illegal to engage in extra-marital sex, a 
violation of the right to privacy that disproportionately harms LGBT people as well as women, as pregnancy can be deemed evidence of a violation. Women re-porting rape can also find themselves subject to prosecution under this law. Iraq’s criminal code does not explicitly  prohibit same-sex sexual relations, 
350WORLD REPORT 2022but Article 401 of the penal code hold s that any person who commits an “im-
modest act” in public can be imprisoned for up to six months.  
Key International Actors   
On January 3, 2020, a US drone strike killed Lt. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, at Baghdad airport. Two days later, Iraqi parliamentarians passed a non-binding resolution to expel 
US-led coalition troops from the country. In mid-2021, President Biden 
said  that 
by Decem ber 31, US troops would end their co mbat mission in Iraq but would 
continue to provide training and advice to Iraqi forces. 
Turkish airstrikes  continued  in 2021, targeting the Iranian Kurdish Party for Free 
Life of Kurdistan (PJAK) and Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) members based in northern Iraq, in some cases 
killing  civilians . Human Rights Wa tch was un-
aware of any inv estigations  by the Turkish military into possible unlawful attacks 
it had carried out in northern Iraq or compensation of victims.  
In 2017 , the UN Security Council created an investigative team , UNITAD, to docu-
ment serious crimes committed by ISIS in Iraq. Given the deeply flawed Iraqi criminal proceedings against ISIS suspects and ongoing fair trial concerns in the country, it remained uncl ear to what  extent the team has su pported the Iraqi ju-

A Threshold Crossed  
Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution HUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Israel and Palestine 
Across two governments, each in power for roughly half of 2021, Israeli authori-
ties doubled down on policie s to repress Palestinians and privilege Jewish Is-
raelis. The government’s policy of maintaining the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), cou-
pled with the particularly severe repre ssion against Palestinians living in the 
OPT, amounts to the crimes against h umanity of apartheid and persecution. 
In May, amid discriminatory efforts to fo rce Palestinians out of their homes in oc-
cupied East Jerusalem, 11 days of host ilities broke out between the Israeli gov-
ernment and Palestinian armed groups in Gaz a. The Israeli military said it struck 
about 1,500 targets in Gaza with ground- and air-launched munitions, which, ac-cording to UN figures, killed at least 120 Palestinian civili ans. Pales tinian armed 
groups, including Hamas, launched more than 4,000 rockets and mortars to-wards Israel, resu lting in the deaths of 12 civi lians in Is rael and  at least 7 Pales-
tinians in Gaza. 
Human Rights Watch documented serious violations of the laws of war and ap-
parent war crimes during the hostilities, including Israeli strikes that killed 
scores of civilians and destroyed  four high-rise Gaza towe rs full of homes and 
businesses, with no evident military targets in the vicinity, as well as indiscrimi-nate rocket attacks fired  by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups  towards 
Israeli cities. 
These attacks took place amid Israel’s  sweeping restrictions on the movement of 
people and goods into and out of Gaza. With rare exceptions, Israel’s closure policy, which is not based on an individualized assessment of security risk and is exacerbated by Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza, rob the more than two million Palestinians of Gaza of their right to freedom of movement, se-
verely limit their access to electricity, health care, and water, and have devas-tated the economy. More than 80 percent of Gaza’s population depend on humanitarian aid.  
In June, a broad range of political par ties formed a new Israeli coalition govern-
ment, with Naftali Bennett as prime minister. This government continued to facil-itate the transfer of Israeli citizens int o settlements in the occupied West Bank, a 
353HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHwar crime. In October, it advanced plans  and issued tenders for more than 4,000 
new settlement units.  
During the first eight months of 2021, Israeli authorities demoli shed 666 Pales-
tinian homes and other structures in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, displacing 958 people, a 38 percent increa se compared to the same period in 
2020, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA). Most buildings were demolished  for lacking building permits, which au-
thorities make nearly  impossib le for Palestini ans in these areas to ob tain. In 
July, Israeli authorities razed for the si xth time in less than a year the homes of 
most residents of the Palestinian community of Khirbet Humsah in the Jordan Valley for being in a designated “firing zone,” displacing 70 people, 35 of them children. 
Israeli authorities in late 2021 designated six pr ominent Palestini an civil society 
organizations as “terrorist” and “illegal” organizations, moves that permit clos-
ing their offices, seizing their assets, and jailing their staff and supporters.  
The Palestinian Authority (PA) manages affair s in parts of the West Bank, where 
it system atically arrests arbi trarily and tortures d issidents. In April, the PA post-
poned planned parliamentary and presidential elections, which would have been the first in 15 years. In June, PA critic Nizar al-Banat died in custody shortly after PA forces arrested and beat him outside a relative’s home. The PA violently 
dispersed popular protests and rounded up scores of Palestinians demanding justice for al-Banat’s death.  
GAZA STRIP 
During the May hostilities, 260 Palestinians  were killed, including 66 children, 
and 2,200 were wounded, “some of whom may suffer a long-term disability re-quiring rehabilitation,” according to OCHA. Authorities in Gaza said that 2,400 housing units were made uninhabitable and over 50,000 units were damaged. 8,250 people remained internally displaced as of October 14, OCHA said. The fighting also damaged 331 educational facilities, 10 hospitals, and 23 primary health clinics. The World Bank estimated $380 million in total physical damage 
and $190 million in economic losses. 
354WORLD REPORT 2022Israeli Closure 
For a 14th consecutive year, Israeli authorities blocked most of Gaza’s popula-
tion from traveling through the Erez Cro ssing, the sole passenger crossing from 
Gaza into Israel through whic h Palestinians can travel to the West Bank and 
abroad. A generalized travel ban applies to all, except those whom Israeli au-
thorities deem as presenting “exceptional hum anitarian circumstances,” mostly 
persons needing vital medical treatment and their companions, as well as prominent business people. Even the few seek ing to travel under these narrow 
exemptions, including those seeking urgent medical care outside Gaza, often face denials or failures to respond to in a timely manner to their requests. 
Israeli authorities tightened the closure amid  the Covid-19 pandemic. During the 
first nine months of 2021, an average of 86 Palestinians in Gaza exited via Erez each day, just 17 percent of the daily average of 500 in 2019 and less than 1 per-cent the daily average of more than 24,000 before the beginning of the Second Intifada or Palestinian uprising in Sept ember 2000, according to the Israeli 
rights group Gisha. 
Gaza’s exports during this period, mostly  produce destined for the West Bank 
and Israel, averaged 300 truckloads per month, compared to the monthly aver-age of 1,064 truckloads prior to the June 2007 tightening of the closure, accord-ing to Gisha. During the May hostilities and up until August, Israeli authorities banned the entry of construction material s and other vital materials and limited 
access to Gaza’s territorial waters for Palestinian fishermen, measures targeting 
Gaza’s general  civili an population th at amount  to unla wful collect ive punish-
ment. Authorities continue to severely restrict the entry of construction materials 
and other items they deem “dual-use” materials that could also be used for mili-
tary purposes. The list of such it ems also includes X-ray and communications 
equipment and spare parts.  
The closure limits access to basic services. During the first nine months of 2021, 
families in Gaza on average had to make do without centrally provided electricity for more than 11 hours a day, according to OCHA. Chronic prolonged power out-
ages encumber many aspects of every day life, from heating and cooling and 
sewage treatment to health care and business, in particular for people with dis-abilities who rely on light to communicate using sign language or equipment 
355HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHpowered by electricity, such as elevator s or electric wheelchairs, to move. OCHA 
found that Gaza’s  groundwater , its sole natural water sourc e, is “almost com-
pletely unfit for human consumption.” According to the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO), 42 percent of “essential” medic ines were at less than one month’s 
supply as of June. 
Egypt also restricts the movement of people and goods via its Rafah crossing 
with Gaza, at times fully sealing the crossing. In the first nine months of 2020, an average of 13,678 Palestinians crossed monthly in both directions, less than the monthly average of over 40,000 before the 2013 military coup in Egypt, ac-cording to Gisha. 
Hamas and Palestinian Armed Groups  
Rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups resulted in the deaths of 13 people in Israel, all during the May hostilities.  
Hamas authorities p rovided no inform ation about two Is raeli civilians with psy-
chosocial disabilities, Avera Mangistu and Hisham al-Sayed, whom they have apparently held in violation of international law for more than six years after they 
entered Gaza. 
Hamas authorities detained  opponents and c ritics f or their peaceful  expression 
and tortured some in their custody. The P alestinian statutory watchdog, the In-
dependent Comm ission f or Human Rights (ICHR), re ceived 75 comp laints of  arbi-
trary arrests and 72 of torture and ill-tre atment ag ainst Ha mas authoritie s 
between January and September 2020. 
Since they took c ontrol in Gaza in June 2007 , Ha mas authorities carried out 28 
executions following trials marred with due process violations, but none during the first nine months of 2021. Courts in Gaza had, as of October 24, sentenced 19 people to death this year and 161 since June 2007 , according to the Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights. 
In February, Ha mas authoritie s issued new restrictions th at allow m ale guardians 
to request local authorities to block unmarried women from leaving Gaza when such travel will cause “absolute harm,” a broad term that allows men to restrict women’s travel at will.

Israeli Use of Force and Detentions 
In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Is raeli security forces, as of October 
14, killed 67 Palestinians—nearly triple the figure for all of 2020 and including 14 
children—and wounded more than 1,000 Palestinians with live ammunition, ac-
cording to OCHA. This total includes non -violent demonstrators and bystanders, 
as well as those alleged to have attacked Israelis.  
On July 28, Isr aeli officers shot and ki lled 11-year- old Mohammad  Abu Sarah in 
the back of his father’s car at the entrance to their village of Beit Ummar near He-bron in a situation where neither posed any app arent threat to Israeli soldiers, 
as documented in video footage publis hed by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. 
Israeli settlers killed five Palestinians, wou nded 137 , and caused property dam-
age in 287 incidents, as of October 22, according to OCHA. The number of inci-dents of settler vio lence against Pal estinians in the fi rst half of 2021 was more 
than double the figure for the first half of 2020 and more than all of 2019, ac-cording to government data. As of October 16, Palestinians killed one Israeli set-
tler and wounded 37 Israeli soldiers and 72 settlers in the West Bank. 
Israeli authorities have rarely held accountable security forces who used exces-
sive forc e or settlers who attacke d Palestinians. 
Israeli authorities closely monit or online speech by Pales tinians, in part relying 
on predictive algorithms to determine whom to target, and have detained Pales-tinians based  on social media posts and  other expre ssive activity. 
While applying Is raeli civil law to settlers, Israeli authorities go vern West Bank 
Palestinians, excluding Jerusalem residents, under harsh military law. In so doing, they deny them basic due process and try them in military courts with a 
near-100 percent conviction rate.  
As of October 1, Israel held 4,460 Pal estinians in custody f or “security” offenses, 
including 200 children, many for throwing st ones, and 492 in administrative de-
tention without formal charges or trial and based on secret evidence, according 
to figures by the Israeli human rights gr oup HaMoked and Palestinian prisoner 
rights group Adameer. Israel incarcerates many Palestinians from the OPT inside 
357HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIsrael, complicating f amily visits and violating internation al humanit arian law’s 
prohibition against their transfer outs ide occupied territory. 
In September, six Palestinian prisoners fr om the OPT escaped from an Israeli 
prison in northern Israel. In response, Isr aeli authorities temporarily cancelled 
family visits to all detainees. Lawyers for several of the men said the escaped 
prisoners were tortured upon their rearrest. 
More than 1,300 complaints of torture, including of painful shackling, sleep dep-
rivation and exposure to extreme temperatures, have been filed with Israel’s Jus-tice Ministry since 2001, resulting in two criminal investigations and no indictments, according to the Israeli rights gr oup Public Committee Against Tor-
ture. 
In August, the Israeli Supreme Court up held the Israeli government’s policy of 
withholding the bodies of Palestinians kil led in what they consider security inci-
dents, as leverage to secure Hamas’s relea se of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers 
presumed killed in 2014 hostilities, as authorities have acknowledged. As of Au-
gust, authorities held the bodies of 81 Pales tinians killed since 2015, according 
to the Haifa-based human rights group Adalah. 
Settlements and Home Demolitions 
Israeli authorities provide security, infrastruc ture, and services for more than 
667 ,000 settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. 
The difficulty in obtaining Israeli building permits in East Jerusalem and the 60 
percent of the West  Bank under Israel’s  exclusive  control (Area  C) has driven 
Palestinians to build structures that are at constant risk of demolition or confis-cation for being unauthorized. OCHA considers 46 Palestinian communities in 
the West Bank to be at “high risk of forcible transfer due to a ‘relocation’ plan ad-vanced by the Israeli authorities,” and more than 100,000 Palestinians in East 
Jerusalem at risk of displacement. Save the Children considered, as of February, 
more than 50 kindergartens and primar y schools, serving more than 5,000 
Palestinian kids in the West Bank, at risk of demolition.   
International  law prohibits an oc cupying power fr om destroying pr operty unless 
“absolutely necessary” for “military operations.” 
358WORLD REPORT 2022In the East Jerusalem neighborhoods of Shei kh Jarrah and Silwan, Israeli settler 
organizations advanced efforts to take  possession of Palestinian homes and 
evict their long-term residents. They have done so under a discriminatory law, upheld by Israeli courts, that allow these gr oups to pursue claims for land they 
claim Jews owned in East Jerusalem bef ore 1948. Pales tinians, including Sheikh 
Jarrah residents set to be displaced, are barred under Israeli law from reclaiming property they owned in what became Isr ael, and from which they fled in 1948. A 
final court ruling on many of these cases is pending. 
Freedom of Movement  
Israeli authorities continued to require Pal estinian ID holders with rare excep-
tions to hold difficult-to-obtain, time-limited  permits to enter Israel and large 
parts of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. B’Tselem describes this as “an arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bu reaucratic system” where “many applica-
tions are denied without explanation, with no real avenue for appeal.” Israeli au-thorities, as of June 2020, maintained nearly 600 checkpoints and other permanent obstacles within the West Bank, in addition to nearly 1,500 ad-hoc “flying” checkpoints erected between April 2019 and March 2020, according to 
OCHA. Israeli forces routinely turn away or delay and humiliate Palestinians at 
checkpoints without explanation, while permitting la rgely unfettered movement 
to Israeli settlers. 
The separation barrier, which Israel said it bu ilt for security reasons but 85 per-
cent of which falls within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line sepa-rating Israeli from Palestinian territory, cuts off thous ands of Palestinians from 
their agricul tural lands. It also isolates  11,000 Palestini ans who l ive on the west-
ern side of the barrier but are not allowed to travel to Israel and whose ability to 
cross the barrier to access their property and  basic services is highly restricted. 
Palestinian Authority  
Following the death in custody of act ivist Niz ar al-Banat  in June, the PA detained 
activis ts on manifestly  political char ges, like insu lting “higher authorities” and 
creating “sectarian strife,” that in effect criminalized peaceful dissent. Between January and September 2021, the ICHR received 87 complaints of arbitrary ar-rests, 15 of detention without trial or charge pursuant to orders from a regional 
governor, and 76 of torture and ill-treatment against the PA. 
359HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPA personal status laws discriminated against women, including in relation to 
marriage, divorce, custody of children and inheritance. Women’s rights groups 
have documented an increase in reports  of domestic violence since the begin-
ning of the Covid-19 pandemic, with five women killed across the OPT in 2021. Palestine has no c omprehen sive domestic vi olence law. The PA is c onsidering a 
draft family protection law, but women’s rights  groups have raised concern that 
it does not go far enough to  prevent abu se and prot ect sur vivor s.  
The penal code in force in the West Bank and Gaza permits corporal punishment 
of children by parents, which remains a widespread practice. 
ISRAEL 
During the May hostilities, intercommunal violence broke out in cities where 
both Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Is raelis lived, leaving three people killed 
and hundreds wounded, including both Pales tinians and Jews. According to the 
Haifa-based Mossawa Center, more than 2,000 people were detained in the af-
termath, over 90 percent of them Palestini ans. Human rights groups accused the 
Israeli government of failing to sufficiently protect Palestinians  from attacks by 
armed Jewish mobs. 
In July, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld the Nation State Law, a law with consti-
tutional status that affirms Israel as the “nation-state of the Jewish people,” de-clares that within that territory the right to self-determination “is unique to the Jewish people,” and establishes “Jewish settlement” as a national value.  
The Knesset in July failed to renew a temporary order that had been in place 
since 2003 barring, with few exceptions, the granting of long-term legal status inside Israel to Palestinians from the West  Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citi-
zens or residents. Interior Minister Ayelet Sh aked instructed authorities to con-
tinue to act as if the la w was in place while the Interior Ministry ex amines the 
implications of its expiration, prolonging the sep aration of many families. Such a 
restriction does not exist for spouses of virtually any other nationality. 
Israeli authorities continued to systematically deny asylum claims of the roughly 
31,000 Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers in the country. Over the years the government has impo sed restrictions  on their movement, w ork permits, and ac-
cess to health care and to education in order to pressure them to leave.  
360WORLD REPORT 2022Covid-19 
The Covid-19 pandemic continued to affect communities in Israel and the OPT. 
The Israeli government had vaccinated mor e than two-thirds of its citizens and 
residents and begun offering third booster shots, as of October. Israeli authori-
ties provided vaccines to Palestinian citizens  of Israel and residents of occupied 
East Jerusalem, as well as Israeli settlers in the West Bank, but not to most of the more than 4.7 million Palestinians liv ing under Israeli control in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza.  
Israeli authorities claim this responsibility falls on the PA, but the Fourth Geneva 
Convention oblige s occupying powers to ensur e medical supp lies, including to 
combat the spread of pandemics, to the occupied population. More than 1 mil-lion Palestinians in the West Bank, excluding Jerusalem residents, and 466,000 Palestinians in Gaza, were vaccinated  as of October 21, according to the WHO, 
largely through vaccines obtained from external sources and administered by Palestinian authorities. 
Key International Actors 
During the May fighting, the Biden administration criticized rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups, but not Isr aeli conduct, and proceeded with the sale 
of $735 mil lion in arms to Is rael, including of  the kind of precis ion-guided muni-
tions used in unlawful attacks in Gaza. This funding supplement ed the annual 
$3.7 billion in sec urity assistanc e the US provides and  an additional $1 billion 
authorized in October. 
In May, the UN Human Rights Council est ablished an ongoing Comm ission of In-
quiry (COI) to address abuses arising from the May hostilities and their root causes, including systematic discrimination and repression based on group 
identity across Israel and the OPT, and to  promote accountability for those re-
sponsible. All Western states on the council abstained or voted against creating the COI. 
The European Union condemned Israel’s settlement  policy and Israeli and Pales-

in Italy. The Senate rejected a bill to make incitement to violence or discrimina-
tion based on sex, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity an offense. Au-thorities failed to take steps to ensure access to abortion in ar eas wher e 
significant barriers to access, including high rates of conscientious objection re-main. The Europe an Comm ission noted rule of law c oncerns with res pect to the 
judiciary and the media.  
Covid-19  
The government imposed restrictions on movement  and activity periodically in 
different parts of the countr y due to elevated Covid-19 transmiss ion rates. As of 
mid-September, only Sicily had significant restrictions in place though limits on numbers allowed to gather in public spaces and mask mandates remained throughout Italy. The 
state of emergency , declared at the end of January 2020, 
was set to expire at the end  of 2021.  
Schools throughout the country and at diff erent grade levels adopted hybrid and 
entirely distance learning approaches, with elementary schools largely returning to in-person schooling. Approxim ately 3 million Italian students may not have 
been able to access remote learning during school closures due to a lack of in-ternet connectivity or devices at home, according to estimates by the Italian Na-tional Institute of Statistics. Some sc hools adopted positive measures 
to ensure 
quality education for students with disabilities , including safe in-person learn-
ing, though organizations representing people with disabilities said that many 
children with di sabilities did not receive a quality, inc lusive education, or in 
some cases, any education at all during the pandemic.  
Despite a slow start, Italy’s vaccination campaign had reached 80 percent  of the 
eligible population by mid-October. As of mid-Oc tober, possession of proof of 
vaccination, a negative test, or recovery from Covid— the “green pass” —was 
obligatory in virtually all public spaces and private workplaces. Undocumented 
363HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmigrants and people experiencing homelessness faced bureaucratic and other 
obstacles  to accessing the vaccine, and even when vaccinated, faced obstacles 
to obtaining the green pass.  
Despite early release programs to alleviate overcrowding in prisons during the 
pandemic, in June Italian prisons were at 113 percent capacity  according to the 
quasi-independent ombudsman for people deprived of their liberty. Limits on prison vis its, movement w ithin facilities, and other act ivities, imposed  during 
the pandemic, remained in place in some prisons. 
Vaccination rates in prisons  
were in line with national rates.  
Migrants and Asylum Seekers  
Italy evacuated 4,890 Afghans —individuals who had worked with the Italian mil-
itary mission and their families—out of Kabul between June and August. At time of writing, it was unclear whether they would be proc essed under the normal 
asylum procedure or would be granted prima facie refugee status. The 
govern-
ment was purs uing arrangements  to allow municipalities, associations, and pri-
vate citizens to host Afghan families due to lack of capacity in the state reception system. In November the government announced agreements with faith-based and  civil society organizations to  facilitate 
“humanitarian corridors” 
to Italy for 1,200 Afghans  from countries neighboring Afghanistan.  
In January, a court in Rome ruled that pushbacks to Slovenia under a decades-
old readmission agreement violated the Italian Constitution, the European Con-
vention on Human Rights, and the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights because of the risk of chain refoulement and inhuman and degrading treatment in neighbor-ing countries along the Balkan route. Migr ants faced dire humanitarian condi-
tions in border regions with France, while 
French police summarily returned  
unaccompanied children and adults to Italy.  
In July, parliament renewed funding f or migration cooperation with Libya despite 
overwhelming evidence of brutality against migrants, the systematic use of arbi-trary detention, and the complete absence of  an asylum system in Libya. Libyan 
forces receiving support from Italy and the EU interdicted at sea and took back to Libya more than 27 ,500 
people  by late October. 
364WORLD REPORT 2022According to government statistics, mor e than 52,770 people reached Italy by 
sea, including 7 ,190 unaccompanied children, by late  October. Ther e was an in-
crease in boats arriv ing without the assistanc e of rescue ships to Lampedusa, an 
Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea, where the reception facility able to ac-commodate up to 250 people was periodically we ll over capa city, with 
more than 
1,200  at one point in August. 
Italian authorities allowed nongovernmental res cue ships to disembark, usually 
after some delay. However, they also often held ships in port for administrative 
reasons, inhibiting rescue efforts. The Council of Eur ope Comm issioner for 
Human Rights  expressed concern about Italy’s use of ferries to quarantine peo-
ple arriving by sea and called on the government to prioritize prompt disem-barkation on land.  
According to the International  Organization for Migration, 1,224 
persons died or 
went missing  in the central Mediterranean by late October, many while attempt-
ing to cross to Italy.  
In January, the UN Human Rights Committee  found Italy responsible for con-
tributing to the deaths in 2013 of an estimated 200 people, including 60 chil-
dren, when it failed to respond adequately to distress calls about an overcrowded migrant boat in the Mediterranean. 
Prosecutors in Agrigento 
opened an investigation  in July against Libyan authori-
ties for “attempted s hipwreck” of a migrant boat following a complaint, with 
footage and photos, filed  by the nongovernmental organization Sea-Watch of an 
incident in late June in which a Libyan coast guard boat maneuvered danger-
ously and appears to fire shots. In May, the same office dropped all charges 
against Carola Rackete , the Sea-Watch captain who had docked her rescue ship 
in Lampedusa without authorization in 2019.  
In the first ruling of its kind against a commercial ship’s captain, in October a 
court in Naples convicted and sentenced to one year  in prison the captain of the 
Asso 28, a service ship for an Itali an oil platform in the Mediterranean Sea, for 
returning more than 100 people to Libya  in July 2018 following a rescue. 
The trial of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini  for abduction and dereliction 
of duty over his handling of the disemb arkation of 147 people from a rescue ship 
365HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHbelonging to the Spanish NGO Open Arms in August 2019 began in October  in 
Palermo. In May, a judge in Catania dismissed a similar case  against Salvini in-
volving a delay in disembarkation from an Italian military s hip, also in 2019.  
One year after a flawed program  was launched to provide res idency permits to 
undocumented migrants working in agricul ture, domestic work, and home care, 
only 25 percent  of the roughly 207 ,800 applications had been processed.  
In September, a court in Calabria convicted and sentenced Domenico Lucano , 
the former mayor of Riace, to more than 13 years in prison—double what prose-cutors had requested—on charges of abetting irregular immigration and irregu-
larities in a program that settled and emplo yed hundreds of asylum seekers in 
the small town.  
Discrimination and Intolerance  
At time of writing, the trial of four men  was ongoing for the brutal  beating to 
death in Septem ber 2020 of 21-year- old Willy Monteiro Duarte , a Black Italian, in 
a town on the outskirts of Rome. The men are accused of voluntary homicide; prosecutors did not charge them with the aggravating circumstance of racial 
bias.  
One year after it was approved by the lower house of p arliament, the Senate re-
jected a 
bill to make incitement to violence or discrimination “based on sex, 
gender, sexual orientation or gender identity” a crime. The bill would have broadened existing law on bias crimes in It aly, increased funding for projects to 
prevent and counter violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as for victim support, and instituted a national day against homophobia. 
Women’s Rights  
The Council of Europe Committee of Social Rights said in January  that Italy had 
failed to take adequate measures to ensure access to abortion under national law given the high number of consc ientious objectors among healthcare work-
ers. In its 
annual report on access to abortion , in July, the Ministry of Health pro-
vided data from 2019 indicating that 67 percent of gynecologists and 43.5 
366WORLD REPORT 2022percent of anesthesiologists in Italy  refuse to perform abortions, a slight de-
crease over the previous year.  
Data published in May showed that calls to the national hotline for victims of 
gender-based violence and stalking increa sed by 79 percent in 2020, in particu-
lar during the months of lockdown, compar ed to the year before. The govern-
ment said that reports of gender-based violence decreased  by 8 percent in the 
first half of the year compared to the same period in 2020. The Interior Ministry reported that 86 women were killed by relatives or people they knew in the first ten months of the year, 59 of them by a partner or ex-partner.  
At time of writing, the executive branch had yet to formally ratify International 
Labour Organiz ation Convention 190 on vi olence and harassment in emplo yment 
though parliament 
gave its approval in January . 
Rule of Law 
In its July European rule of law report , the European Comm ission noted the need 
to strengthen judicial independenc e and tackle excessive length of proceedings 
in Italy. The report cited the lack of an effective law regulating conflicts of inter-
est in the media sector as reason for conc ern over political interference in media 
freedom and called physical attacks and  intimidation against journalists in Italy 
“an issue of concern.” Italy’s Interior Ministry recorded a 19 percent increase  in 
such cases in the first seven months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.  
The revelation in April that 
prosecutors in Sicil y secretly recorded  hundreds of 
conversations between at least 15 journalists working on migration issues and NGO staff caused significant concern about violation of confidentiality.

RIGHTS   WATCH  Japan 
Japan is a liberal demo cracy w ith a vigorous  civil society . In October , the Liberal 
Democratic Party’s (LDP) Fumio Kishida became Japan’s prime minister succeed-ing Yoshihide Suga, who served for about a year. The LDP secured a sole majority in the lower house election held on October 31.  
Japan has no law prohibiting racial, ethnic, or religious di scrimination, or dis-
crimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Japan does not have a national human rights institution.  
Covid-19  
Japan declared states of emergency in response to the Covid-19 pandemic three 
separate times in 2021 ( January-March , April-June  , and July-September ). In Feb-
ruary, Japan revised  its laws to allow authorities to impose administrative fines 
on businesses for not complying with business hour restrictions, as well as on individuals infected with Covid-19 who refuse hospitalization.   
In May, Japan’s government said it woul d not oppose, but also did not endorse, 
a temporary waiver at the World Trade Organization of intellectual property laws that would allow increased global production of Covid-19 vaccines and other medical products.  
Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games  
The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were hosted in Japan between July and September 2021 after being delayed for a year due to the Covid-19 pan-demic. In February, Yoshiro Mori, the head of the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee, 
resigned  after making sexist remarks about adding women to the 
Olympics Committee board. Keigo Oy amada, the music composer for the 
Olympics opening and closing ceremonies, resigned  in July after a past interview 
resurfaced in which he admitted to bul lying class mates with disa bilities. Kentaro 
Kobayashi, the show director of the opening and closing ceremonie s, was fired  
in July over his past comments about the Holocaust.  
369HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHRefugees 
Japan’s asylum and refugee determination system remains strongly oriented 
against granting refugee status. In 2020 , the Justice Ministry received 3,936 ap-
plications for refugee status, but recogniz ed only 47 people as refugees, and cat-
egorized another 44 persons as needing humanitarian assistanc e, allow ing them 
to stay in Japan.  
In February, the government proposed an amendment to the Immigration Control 
and Refugee Recognition Act that would allow for supervised release upon pay-ment of a deposit for people subject to a deportation measure as an alternative to detention. In March, four UN human rights experts said the amendment con-tinued to embody a “presumption of detention,” rather than treating detention as a measure of last resort. The amendment also introduced, for the first time, a provision in Japanese law for comp lementary protection f or non-refugees who 
need protection, but still fell short of meeting Japan’s nonrefoulement obliga-
tions, according to UNHCR. 
Sri Lankan migrant Wishma Sandamali, 33, died in detention in March, after 
being denied access to adequate medical treatment by detention authorities. With intensified domestic and international criticism following her death, on top of existing criticism of the bill, the Japanese government, in a rare move, 
dropped  the amendment in May.  
Death Penalty 
In December, Japan executed three peop le on death row. At the end of 2021, 
there were 107 people on death row. Concerns have long been raised about death-row inmates being notified of their execution only on the day it takes place and having inadequate access to legal counsel.  
In November, two prisoners on death row  sued the government seeking compen-
sation for the “extremely inhumane” same-day notices and executions.
370WORLD REPORT 2022Women’s Rights  
In June, to encourage men to take childcare leave, Japan  revised  the Act on 
Childcare and Caregiv er Leave. A new pro vision allows m ale employees to take 
up to four weeks of leave during the fi rst eight weeks after their child is born on 
top of benefits already offered by the chi ldcare leave system. The revised law 
also requires corporations to proactiv ely confirm with their emp loyees, regard-
less of their gender, whether they are interested in using childcare leave bene-
fits. The use of childcare leave by men remained low, at less than 10 percent in 
2019 .  
Following a 2015 decis ion, Japan’s Supr eme Court, in June, again ruled  the coun-
try’s lack of a dual-surname system for married couples is constitutional. Some 
96 percent  of married couples end up using their hus-
band’s surname, partly due to social norms and socioeconomic inequalities .  
Children’s Rights  
In February, the Osaka District Court ruled  that a public high school forcing a stu-
dent to dye her hair black according to school rules was legal .  In October, the 
Osaka High Court ruled against the student’s appeal, judging the school’s ac-tions as legal. Many
 schools in Japan continue to dictate the color of their stu-
dents’ hair, clothes, and, in certain cases, their underwear .  
In May, Japan’s parliament  passed  a law to curb sexual a buse against children 
by teachers.  The new law included the re vision of the School Teacher’s License 
Act to allow regional educational boards to refuse the reissuing of teaching li-
censes to teachers who lost their teaching licenses for sexually abusing chil-
dren. Previously, the authorities were not able to do so if three years had passed 
since teachers’ licenses were revoked.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
In a landmark de cision, the Sapporo Dist rict Court, in March, ruled  that the gov-
ernment’s failure to recognize same-sex marriages is un constitutional and dis-
criminatory in the country’s first judicial ruling on marriage equality. Similar trials are pending at five district courts, including in Tokyo and Osaka.

The government still requires steri lization surgeries bef ore transgender people

Right to Health 
In July, then-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said  he would not appeal a Hi-
roshima High Court ruling extending recognition and benefits to a broader range of individuals affected by radioactive “ black rain” caused by the US atomic 
bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following the ruling, Suga issued a 
state-
ment  that effectively overturned Japan’s previous position of not recognizing 
many v ictims of “ black rain” as “Hibakushas,” at omic bomb su rvivors entitled to 
government relief.  
Forced Disappearances by North Korea 
In August, the Tokyo District Court  summoned  North Korea’s leader Kim Jong 
Un to face demands for compensation  from five North Korean escapees in Japan, 
who say they suffered human rights abuses in North Korea after joining a reset-tlement progr am on false premises th at North Kore a was a “Paradi se on Earth.” 
The judgment is scheduled to be delivered on March 23, 2022. Approximately 93,000 ethnic Koreans (Zainichi) and Japane se migrated from Japan to North 
Korea under the program’s auspices between 1959 and 1984.  
Japan continues to demand the return of 12 Japanese citizens whom North Korea 
abducted in the 1970s and 1 980s. Some Japanese civil society  groups insist the 
number of abductees is much higher. 
Climate Change Policies and Impacts 
Japan is among the top 10 emitter s of greenhouse gases responsible for the cli-
mate crisis that is taking a g rowing toll on h uman rights arou nd the globe. 
373HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThen-Prime Minister Suga announced in October 2020 that Japan will cut emis-
sions to net zero by 2050 and, in April 2021, announc ed an emiss ions reduction 
target of 46 percent by 2030, earning it an “almost sufficient” rating for its “Do-mestic Target” from the Climate Action Tracker. 
Following the Fukushima nuclear accident  in 2011, Japan increased its reliance 
on fossil fuels, including coal to generate electricity. In July 2021, Japan released 
a draft of its 2030 strategic energy stra tegy that stated Japan would aim to re-
duce coal to 19 percent of energy use by 2030, just a 13 percentage point reduc-
tion from current levels. Japan’s government, financial institutions, and 
industrial companies are also major prov iders of finance and technical support 
for development  of overseas coal plants, second only to Chin a. Despite an-
nouncements restricting coal lending, loophole s in these policies mean Japan 
continues to be a lender to a variety of high-emitting coal plans, including in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Indonesia. 
Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on Japan due to sea-
level rise, increased summer heat, s hifting precipitation patt erns, and more fre-
quent and intense extreme weather events. In August, the heaviest rain since 1982 caused flooding and landslides in some locations that left at least 13 peo-ple dead. 
Foreign Policy  
Japan officially states  it aims to “contribute to the improvement of the world’s 
human rights envi ronment,” but has not played a leadership role. 
After the Myanmar military staged a coup in February, Japan suspended new 
non-humanitarian aid to Myanmar and supported a Myanmar resolution at the UN General Assembly in June, a major shift from its continual abstention since 2017. Japanese business projects in Myanmar including 
Y-Complex , a high-end 
real estate project in Yangon, continued to face criticism  for its connections to 
the Myanmar military.  
After the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan, Japan’s response for fleeing 
Afghan civi lians at ri sk has been to provide visas for a limited num ber of Af ghans 
with past ties to Japan. Pledges for resettlement have not been announced. At 
time of writing, Afghans eligible for the scheme  were those who worked directly 
374WORLD REPORT 2022with the Japanese government and their fami lies, those who worked directly with 
private Japanese organizations, and Af ghan students who studied in Japan, but 
not family members. Details of the scheme had not been publicly disclosed. 
Japan again led the negotiation of a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council 
on the human rights sit uation in Cambodia. The adopted  resolution was weak, 
and while it failed to sufficiently reflect the deteriorating human rights situation 
in the country, it did renew the mandate of the special rapporteur and increase 
international scrutiny ahead of the 2022 elections, through additional reporting to the Human Rights Council. 
375HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHJordan 
In 2021, Jordanian authorities did not rescind a state of emergency  declared in 
March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, granting the prime minister sweeping powers to rule by decree. 
In June, King Abdullah II convened a 92-member committee to make recommen-
dations for reforming and modernizing Jordan’s  political system. In October, the 
committee, chaired by former Prime Minister Samir Rifai, 
issued recommenda-
tions  for amending laws on political par ties and elections, but it was unclear 
whether the recommendations would improve access to political participation across Jordanian society.  
On July 12, Jordan’s State Security Court 
convicted  a former high-level official and 
a little-known royal family member of “so wing discord” and “inciting opposition 
to the political regime,” sentencing both of them to 15 years in prison for al-legedly undertaking a plot to “mobi lize public opinion against the ruling regime 
in the kingdom and propose Prince Hamza [King Abdullah II’s younger half-brother] as an alternative to take rule.” 
Freedom of Expression  
Jordanian law criminalizes speech deemed c ritical of the king, foreign countries, 
government officials and institutions, Islam and Christianity, and defamatory 
speech. 
Jordanian authorities further curtailed press freedom  in 2021 by issuing arbitrary 
press gag orders prohibiting repor ting on important local developments, includ-
ing local reporting on the  ongoing crackdown on the independent Teachers’ Syndicate and the April arrests of individuals connected to Prince Hamza ac-cused of undertaking a plot to u ndermine the country’s leadership. Jordanian 
press outlets did not report on 
revelations  about the king’s real estate holdings 
in the United States and United Kingdom as part of the Pandora Papers reporting in October. 
376WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Association and Assembly  
In 2021 Jordan’s Ministry of Social Development convened a committee to draft 
amendments to Jordan’s Law on Associations (NGO law) but as of October 2021 the committee, which included r epresentatives of local and international non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), had yet to issue the draft amendments. 
Under the Public Gatherings Law amended in March 2011, Jordan did not require 
government perm ission to hold pub lic meetings or demonstr ations, but organi-
zations and v enues continued to be r equired to obtain permiss ion from the Inte-
rior Ministry or General Intelligence Department to host events. In August, Jordanian security authorities 
blocked  a public book launch hosted in part by the 
Ministry of Culture. 
Jordanian authorities in 2021 continued a crackdown on the independent Teach-
ers Syndicate, keeping it shuttered on dubious legal grounds , and on December 
31, 2020, a Jordanian court sentenced the syndicate leaders to one year in 
prison on vague charges after an unfair trial. 
Refugees and Migrants  
By late 2021, over 670,000  people from Syria had sought  refuge in Jordan, ac-
cording to the UN High Comm issioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Ov er 85 percent of 
Syrians lived outside refugee c amps in rented accommodation.  
According to the UNHCR, Jordan also hoste d asylum seekers and refugees from 
other countries in 2021, including  66,665 Iraqis, 12,866 Yemenis, 6,013 Su-
danese, 696 Somalis, and 1,453 fr om other countries. Authorities continued to 
enforce a January 2019 decision b anning the UNHCR from r egistering as a sylum 
seekers individuals who officially entered the country for the purposes of med-
ical treatment, study, tourism, or work, effectively barring recognition of non-Syr-ians as refugees and leaving many without UNHCR documentation or access to services. 
Jordanian authorities in 2021 
deported  at least six Yemeni asylum seekers regis-
tered with UNHCR and issued deportation orders against others who made asy-lum claims. The authorities handed down most  of the deportation orders after 
377HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthe Yemenis attempted to apply for work permits and regularize their immigra-
tion status in the country. 
Authorities continued to implement the Jo rdan Compact, the 2016 agreement 
between the Jordanian government and donor countries, which aimed to im-
prove the livelihoods of Syrian ref ugees by granting new legal work opportunities 
and improving the education sector. By the end of 2020, labor authorities had is-sued or renewed at least 
215,668  work permits for Syrians since 2016, although 
many of these were renewals . The number of currently valid individual permits 
was not reported but was appar ently much lower. Most professions  remained 
closed to non-Jordanians, and many Syri ans continued to work in the informal 
sector without labor protections. 
The roughly 230,000 school-age Syrian re fugees in Jordan face multiple obsta-
cles to education that are most acute for children ages 12 and older, including 
poverty-driven child labor and child marriage, lack of affordable school trans-portation, government policies that limit access to education, and lack of inclu-sive education and accommodation for ch ildren with di sabilities.  
Only a quarter of secondar y-school-age Syrian refugee children in Jordan were 
enrolled in school . Non-Syrians refugees and asylum seekers were in many cases 
prevented from enrolling their children in school in 2021. Children without offi-
cial identification numbers were unable to access  online learning platforms dur-
ing Covid-19 school closures. 
Authorities did not allow aid deliveries from Jo rdan to tens of thousands of Syri-
ans at Rukban, an unofficial camp along Jordan’s border with Syria. Authorities 
deported  Syrians to Rukban in 2020 without permitting them to challenge their 
deportations. 
The economic downturn and drastic lockdown measures have undermined the 
livelihoods of thousands of Syrian ref ugees. Syrian refugees who voluntarily re-
turned to Syria between 2017 and 2021 from Jordan faced grave human rights 
abuses  and persecution at the hands of Sy rian government and affiliated mili-
tias, including torture, extra-judicial ki llings, and kidnappings. While Jordan 
does not impose a formal re-entry b an on Syrian refugee s, Jordanian border 
guards said they could not re-enter Jord an for three to five years, denying re-
378WORLD REPORT 2022turnees the right to claim asylum if, having returned to Syria, they again face per-
secution. 
Jordan hosted an estimated 70,000 migrant domestic workers  in 2021, mostly 
from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. NGOs repeat edly referred domes-
tic workers who had suffered multiple abus es to labor ministry investigators. 
Abuses included non-payment of wages, unsafe working conditions, long hours, document confiscation, and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse.  
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Jordan’s personal status code remains discriminatory, despite amendments in 
2019. Women need the permiss ion of a male guardian to marry for the first time, 
and marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men are not recognized. 
Women cannot travel abroad with their children, as men can, without the permis-sion of their child’s father or male guar dian or a judge. While women can travel 
outside the country w ithout needing perm ission, authorities sometime s comply 
with requests from male guardians to bar their unmarried adu lt daughters, 
wives, and children fr om leaving the country. Authoritie s also arrest women re-
ported as “absent” for fleeing their home by their male guardians under the Crime Prevention Law. 
Article 98 of Jordan’s penal code, amended in 2017 , states that the “fit of fury” 
defense does not allow mitigat ed sentences for perpetrators of crimes “against 
women,” but judges continued to impose mitigat ed sentences under article 99 if 
family members of victims did not su pport prosecutions of their male family 
members. Article 340 of the Penal Code also allows a man to receive a reduced sentence if he kills or attacks his wife or any of his female relatives in the alleged act of committing adu ltery or in an “ unlawful bed.”  
Such discriminatory laws leave women exposed to violence. Jordan’s Higher 
Population Council 
reported  in October that it recorded a “dramatic increase” in 
domestic violence in 2020 with a total of 54,743 cases, with 82 percent perpe-trated by husbands agains t their wives. In 2021, Tadamon (Si sterhood is Global 
Institute Jordan - SIGI), 
reported  that men in Jordan had murdered more than 14 
women between January and October 2021. Simi larly, the penal code and Juve-

Article 9 of Jordan’s nationality law doe s not allow Jordanian women married to 
non-Jordanian spouses to p ass on their nationality  to their spouse and children. 
In 2014, authorities issued a cab inet decis ion purporting to ea se restrictions on 
access to key economic and social rights for non-citizen childr en of Jordanian 
women, but the measures fell short of  expectations. Non-citizen children of Jor-
danian women no longer r equire work permits f or employment, but many profes-
sions in Jordan remained closed to non-Jordanians. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Jordan has no laws that explicitly c riminalize same- sex relations. The penal code 
includes vague “immor ality” pro visions that could be used to tar get sex ual and 
gender minorities. Jordanian law does not p rohibit discrimination based on sex-
ual orientation and gender identity. 
Jordan summarily deports foreign nationals found to be HIV-positive, and LGBT 
people living with HIV have reported facing stigma and discrimination by med-ical professionals and employe rs, without any legal recourse. 
Criminal Justice  
In March, Jordanian authorities issued  a suspension of detentions for failure to 
repay a debt until the end of the year. The announcement came shortly after Human Rights Watch 
issued a report documenting  Jordan’s harsh treatment of 
people unable to repay their debts. The report showed how in the absence of an adequate social security net, tens of thous ands of Jordanians feel compelled to 
take out loans to cover utilities, groceries, sc hool fees, and medical bills, often 
using unregulated informal lenders, and face months of detention when they fail 
to repay. 
As of November, authorities had not carried out any executions in 2021. Local governor s continued to use pro visions of the Crime Prev ention Law of  1954 
to place individuals in administrative detention for up to one year, in circumven-tion of the Criminal Procedure Law.  
381HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHKey International Actors  
In 2021, the US president requested US$1.275 billion in Foreign Military Financ-
ing, Economic Support, and other aid to Jordan. This exceeds the amount out-lined in the 2018 Memorandum of Understanding between the United States and Jordan. The US did not publicly criticize human rights violations in Jordan in 2021, except in annual reports of the State Department and other agencies. 
Jordan is a member of the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition fighting the Houthi 
forces in Yemen, which continues to commit violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Yemen. 
382WORLD REPORT 2022Kazakhstan  
The Kazakh government continued to claim it is pursuing human rights reforms, 
despite the absence of meaningful improvements in its rights record. Authorities cracked down on government critics using overbroad “extremism” charges, re-
stricted the right to peaceful protest, su ppressed free speech, and failed to ad-
dress impunity for domestic violence and  torture. The government did not extend 
Covid-19 related economic  assist ance into 2021, although the pandemic contin-
ued to affect living standa rds, employment, and schooling. 
There was an increa se in spontaneous stri kes, with workers across the country 
demanding better pay and working conditions. In June, the International Labour Organization (ILO) heavily criticized Kazakhstan for violating international labor rights standard s. In September, a Russi an-American Xinjiang res earcher was ar-
bitrarily banned  from Kazakhstan for five year s. A new inclu sive education law is 
a positive development, but many chi ldren with disabilities continue to be de-
nied the right to education. 
Parliamentary Elections  
Kazakhstan held parliamentary elections on January 10, 2021. The Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights (O SCE/ODHIR) election monitoring mission c oncluded th at the 
elections were “technically prepared  efficiently,” but “lacked genuine competi-
tion” and that the electoral process needed  reform. The ruling Nur Otan Party re-
tained its qualified majority in parliament.  
Civil Society  
In December 2020 and January 2021, tax authorities targeted over a dozen lead-
ing nongovernmental groups (NGOs) with fines and suspensions for allegedly vi-
olating rules for reporting on foreign grants. After sustained public outcry, 
authorities in February dropped  the fines and suspens ion de cisions. In February 
the United Nations  Human Rights Comm issioner Michele Bachelet called on the 
authorities to “eliminate far-reaching reporting requirements” affecting freedom 
of association. 
383HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe human rights defender, Max Bokaev, imprisoned for five years in 2016 for 
peacefully protesting against propo sed land re forms, was released  on February 
4, but remains subject to heavy restrictions. On February 3, police temporarily detained the Uralsk-based journalist Lukpan Akhmedyarov to prevent him from meeting Bokaev. 
Prison officials continued to target Elena Semenova, a Pavlodar-based rights de-
fender who monitors prison conditions, with over a dozen spurious lawsuits in 
2021 in response to her human rights activities.  
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on May 28 found that imprisoned 
labor act ivist Erzhan Elshib aev had been arbitr arily detained . The group called 
for his immediate release and said he should be provided compensation and 
other reparations. 
Freedom of Assembly  
Authorities continued to routinely interfere and restrict the right to peaceful as-sembly by detaining, fining, or sentencing to short-term custodial sentences 
people who tried to ex ercise this right. Police also increasingly  resorted to “ket-
tling” protesters, de fact o detaining groups on the street for up to 10 hours. On 
rare occasions, c ity authorities gr anted permiss ion for protests, for example in 
Uralsk in late February, to a group of  approximately 200 people calling for the re-
lease of political prisoners. 
In February, a small group of ethnic Kazakhs began to gather daily outside the 
Chinese consulate in Almaty to demand that their detained or disappeared loved ones in Xinjiang, China, be released and reunited with them in Kazakhstan. In June and July police detained several pro testers who were later sentenced to up 
to 17 days’ administrative detention. 
Orynbai Okhasov, an act ivist from Uralsk who was sentenced to a one-ye ar pa-
role-like sentence in mid-Nove mber for alleged participation in a banned “ex-
tremist” organization, spent 45 days in ja il in July and August serving three 
consecutive administrative sentences for violating Kazakhstan’s restrictive pub-lic assembly law.  
384WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Expression  
Journalists c ontinue to face ha rass ment, arrest, physical attack, and prosecution 
for carrying out their work. In September, p arliament passed a draft law on the 
protection of chi ldren in its first re ading that cont ains pro visions thr eatening 
freedom of expression. The provis ions, if adopted, would require foreign social 
media platforms to register locally and comply with content removal requests 
within 24 hours. In May, police initiated a criminal investigation on charges of 
“disseminating knowingly false information” against Temirlan Ensebek, a 25-year-old who ran a satirical Instagram a ccount for less than a month before shut-
ting it down.  
In July, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a member of the 
international investigative journalism  collaboration Pegasus Project, reported 
that the phone numbers of human rights defender, Bakytzhan Toregozhina, and 
journalists Serikzhan Mauletbay and Bigeldy Gabdullin appear to have been se-lected for targeting with spyware. 
In March, the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) found that the state had vio-
lated Dmitry Tikhonov’s rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly by det aining him in February 2014 while he was trying to  report on a peaceful 
protest. 
In August, an Almaty court convicted the blogger Ermek Taichibekov on over-
broad criminal  charges of “inc iting national  discord thr ough mass media” and 
sentenced him to seven years in prison.  
OSCE Media Fr eedom Represent ative Teres a Ribeiro, upon c oncluding a visit to 
Kazakhstan on September 17 , said she raised with government officials in Kaza-khstan the issue of journalists’ safety, disinformation, legislative developments, and other challenges. 
Arrest and Harassment of Opposition Members  
Kazakh authorities have continued their multi-year crackdo wn on go vernment 
critics, targeting with criminal prosec ution perceived or actual members of 
banned “extremist” group s, including for participating in peaceful rallies. Courts 
convicted dozens of people in 2021, subjecting them to restrictions including 
385HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmulti-year bans on engaging in political activities, and imprisoned at least seven 
people: Askar Kaiyrbek, Erbol Eskhozhin, and Ulasbek Akhmetov, as well as Askhat Zheksebaev, Kairat Kyly shev, Abai Begimbetov, and Noyan 
Rakhimzhanov.  
On July 30, Aset Abishev, who was imprisoned in 2018 f or alleged pa rticipation 
in the banned Democr atic Choice of Kaza khstan, was released  on parole after 
serving two-and- a-half years of a fo ur-year sentence. 
Labor Rights  
In February 2021, a Shymkent court suspended the independent Industrial Trade 
Union of Fuel and Energy Workers for six  months for allegedly failing to register 
in accordance with Kazakhstan’s restrictive 2014 trade union law. The Congress of Free Trade Unions of Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan’s largest independent trade union, remains unable to register. 
There was an increa se in spontaneous worker s’ strikes and loc al initiat ives to 
unionize in 2021, including in Aktobe region, Nursultan, and Almaty. Authorities in some cases took legal action against work ers for organizing “illegal” strikes. 
In June, the ILO issued highly critical conclusions and recommendations on 
Kazakhstan’s compliance with the Freedom of Association and Protection of the 
Right to Organise Convention, instructing the government to “stop judicial ha-rassment practices of tr ade union leader s” and review the ca ses of individual 
union leaders.  
Violence against Women and Girls  
President Kasy m-Jomart Tokaev  has repeatedly noted th at domestic violence is 
an acute problem and protection of women’s  rights is key. Yet in January, parlia-
ment suspended rev iew of a new draft  domestic violence la w and has not , since 
then, proposed any new legislation offering strengthened protection to women 
from family abuse. Mean while, police and service providers lack appropriate 
training to identify, prevent, and adequately  respond to domestic violence. 
Hundreds of people partic ipated in a march authorized by Almaty city authorities 
for the first time celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8. Participants called for gender equality and criminalization of domestic violence.  
386WORLD REPORT 2022Disability Rights  
In June, Kazakhstan adopted a new inc lusive education law that removed multi-
ple references to a problematic medical and educational exam as a prerequisite for enrolment in a m ainstream school and introduc ed new pro visions that  make 
it state responsibility to provide childr en with disabilities with reasonable ac-
commodations.  
In practice, many chi ldren do not have a ccess to inclu sive education and remain 
isolated in segregated special scho ols or residential institutions, where they can 
face violence, neglect, physical restraint, and overmedication. Kazakhstan has no national plan to close such institutions. Covid-related restrictions on in-per-son education in the first half of the year continued to negatively impact children with disabilities, because of poor internet  connectivity and because digital 
learning platforms are not suffic iently adapted to their needs.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Kazakhstan does not have an anti-discrimination law, nor does its constitution 
prohibit discrimin ation on the b asis of gender identity or sex ual orientation. The 
process for changing one’s leg ally rec ognized gender re mains invasive  and hu-
miliating.  
In May in Shymkent and again in July, in Karaganda, mobs of hostile men at-
tacked small closed-door trainings on women’s rights led by Feminita, a rights group that focuses on lesbian, bi sexual, and queer women. In response, police 
detained Feminita co-leaders Zhanar Sekerbaeva and Gulzada Serzhan and es-corted them out of each city. 
On May 17 , over a do zen ambassadors of embassies in Nursultan iss ued a joint 
statement on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transpho-
bia expressing solidarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and calling on the government to protect all citizens of Kazakhstan from discrimination.  
387HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTorture  
Torture and ill-treatment occur with impunity in Kazakhstan. Radio Azattyk, the 
Kazakh branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Li berty, reported in July that out of 
120 torture allegations that prison facilities had registered between January and May, no cases had been sent to court.  
After members of the National Prevent ive Mechanism (NPM), an anti-torture 
body, visited the 68 -year-old poet and diss ident Aron Atabek and r eported that 
Atabek’s he alth had significantly deterior ated, he was hospit alized. On October 
1, Atabek, who was sent enced in 2006 to 18 years in prison for his al leged role in 
organizing mass riots outside Alm aty, was released  on parole on gr ounds of his 
ill-health. He was comp letely emac iated. Several weeks after his release, Atabek 
died in a hospital in Almaty. 
Poverty and Inequality  
Kazakhstan’s economy recovered slightly in 2021, but following the economic 
downturn that occurred in 2020 in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic and a weak social safety net, Kazakhstan’s poverty rate  has increased to 12-14 percent, 
according to World Bank estimates. Mothers with multiple chi ldren across Kaza-
khstan continued in 2021 to intermittently pr otest for increased social and hous-
ing benefits. 
Key International Actors  
The European Parliament (EP) in February issued  a strongly worded resolution on 
the human rights sit uation in Kazakhstan, focusing on the cra ckdown on civil so-
ciety, torture, free speech, and politic ally motivated persecution. The EP called 
on the government to  “end all f orms of arbitra ry detention, reprisa ls and harass-
ment” against act ivists and other groups and to amend the new pe aceful assem-
bly law.  
In Kazakhstan in August, the newly appointed  European Union special represen-

“We Are All Vulnerable Here” 
Kenya’s Pandemic Cash Transfer Program Riddled With IrregularitiesHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Kenya 
Kenya’s human rights trajectory has rem ained a concern, w ith authorities failing 
to ensure accountability for serious abuses throughout 2021. Kenya, with a long history of violent elections, is set to hold general elections in August 2022. In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, police responded violently to opposition 
supporters’ protesting alleged vote rigging, resulting in the death of over 100 people. Kenyan authorities have done little to ensure accountability for election-
related abuses in the past. 
In mid-2021, the authorities ordered the closu re of both Daadab and Kakuma 
refugee camps by June 2022, although conditions in countries of origin, notably Somalia and South Sud an, were not ye t condu cive f or safe returns.  
The ongoing Covid-19 c risis has devasta ted many livelihood s across Kenya. A 
large number of individuals and families lost some or all of their sources of in-come, with business closures and job losses.  
Extrajudicial killings by police, including du ring the enforcement of Covid-19 con-
tainment measures, have remained largely unaddressed. The two main police accountability institutions, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and Police Internal Affairs Unit, have  been unable, for various reasons, including 
lack of political will, to promptly inv estigate and prosecut e incidents of police 
killings. IPOA started work in 2012 and , eight years later, has man aged just nine 
successful prosecutions for various offence s, mostly for murder, despite com-
mencing investigations into more than 500 new incidents each year.  
Abuses Related to Covid-19 Pandemic  
In a July 2021 report, which focused  on the socio-economic impact of the Covid-
19 pandemic on informal settlements in the capital, Nairobi, Human Rights Watch found that the pandemic devastated many livelihoods, as thousands of individuals and families, who lost some or all of their sources of income, with business closures and job losses, faced the threat of hunger and eviction. Chil-dren went hungry and did not get needed urgent medical treatment.  
The authorities were slow to respond to the needs of the vulnerable groups, in-
cluding households in inf ormal settlements. When the authorities finally created 
the eight-month cash transf er program, it was in adequate and s hort-live d. It pro-
391HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHvided no clear information about eligibility , how beneficiaries were identified, or 
why thousands of household s that met the approved criteria were excluded. 
The Kenyan gov ernment, which has a responsibi lity to ensure no one goes hun-
gry, failed to design a social secu rity program that would guarantee everyone, 
not just a few, an adequate standard of  living during the pandemic. Only a small 
fraction of vulnerable families in Nairobi  benefited from the program, which was 
characterized by lack of transparency, cronyism, nepotism, and outright fa-voritism. The authorities confirmed that the program reached just 29,000 out of over 600, 000 households in Nairobi’s  eight informal settlements. This amounts 
to approximately 4.8 percent of all the households in dire need of support. 
Abuses by Security Forces  
Despite public criticis m, the police continued to use excessive force while en-
forcing coronavirus control measures in 2021. While the government had since eased most of  the measure s, save for the curfew that  was lift ed in October, po-
lice brutality  has persisted.  
On August 1, police in Kianjokoma town, Embu County, eastern Kenya, detained 
two brothers Emmanuel Marura Ndwiga, 19, and Benson Njiru Ndwiga, 22, for vi-
olating the 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew. Relatives found their bodies at a local morgue three days later. The officers who arrested the duo claimed they fell from the moving police vehicle, but an autopsy found that the head and rib injuries 
found on the bodies were inconsistent with the alleged fall. These findings trig-
gered public protests which the police violently suppressed, killing one person. 
On August 15, the Director of Public P rosecutions Noordin Haji charged six police 
officers with the killing of the two brothers.  
In other instances, as in the case of Robert Mutahi, police extorted money from 
people arrested for violating the curfew. Mutahi told media that three police offi-cers detained him on August 12 and forced him to transfer money from his phone to them. The three officers have since been charged with robbery with violence. 
Refugee Rights  
In March 2021, authorities issued a two-w eek ultimatum to the United Nations 
refugee agency, UNHCR, to draft a plan for closing both Daadab and Kakuma 
392WORLD REPORT 2022refugee camps, citing alleged security risks. The camps hosted over 433,000 
refugees as of mid-2021, the majority Somali and South Sudanese. 
 In April, the government announced its intention to close both camps by June 
2022, and UNHC R proposed a roadm ap encomp assing voluntary repatriation, 
some “departures to third countries,” and “alternative stay options in Kenya for certain refugees from East African Community (EAC) countries.” However, the lat-ter does not include Somalia, previous “voluntary” repatriation efforts had 
proved involuntary and coercive, and the security situations in Somalia and South Sudan remained far from safe for return, as they risked being tortured or killed.  
Kenya previously threatened in 2016 and  2019 to close the Dadaab camp on 
grounds that it allegedly harbored members of the Somalia-based Islamist 
armed group Al-Shabab. The authorities have never provided any evidence to support the alleg ation, and no one from the camp has ever been prosec uted for 
links w ith terrorism.  
In May 2021, Selahaddin Gülen, a Turkish man who had requested asylum in 
Kenya, was forcibly returned to Turkey  under suspicious circu mstances. After en-
tering Kenya in October 2020, Gülen was det ained by Kenyan immigration au-
thorities due to an Interpol Red Notic e from Turkey. Kenyan authorities 
commenced extradition proceedings but later substituted this with a deportation 
order.  
On May 3, 2021, during one of h is court-mandated visits  to the Direct orate of 
Criminal Inv estigations in Nai robi, Gülen was reporte d miss ing. Another Tu rkish 
national who had accompanied Gulen to the agency headquarters and disap-peared along w ith him was released by Kenyan authorities on May 5. On May 31, 
the Turkish authorities released a photo of  Gülen in handcuffs in Ankara, Turkey, 
stating that he had been captured by agents of Turkey’s National Intelligence Or-ganization from a foreign coun try and was in the custody of their counterterror-
ism police. The deportation of Gulen, a registered asylum seeker in Kenya, violated Kenya’s obligations to upho ld the principle of non-refoulement under 
international and regional refugee law.

down their homes.  
Women and Girls’ Rights  
In a September 2021 report on gender-based violence (GBV), Human Rights 
Watch found that Kenya, like other countries across the world, recorded an in-crease in violence against women and girls during its lockdown and ongoing 
nightly curfew introduced to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Despite a previ-ous history of heightened incidences of violence against women and girls during 
crisis Kenyan authorities failed to instit ute measures to help prevent sexual  and 
GBV; to properly inv estigate and pro secute cases; and to ens ure survivors have 
access to timely medical treatment, psychosocial care, protection services, and financial assistanc e. In May, President Uhu ru Kenyatta committed  the country to 
ending GBV by 2026, p ledging US$23 mil lion by 2022 incr easing to $50 million 
by 2026. 
The Kenyan gov ernment has an ob ligation to prevent, coun ter, and provide re-
dress for violence against women and girls at all times, including during crises 
and in humanitarian settings. In light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the government should rectify these failures  and build a solid rights-based frame-
work to anticipate future emergency-related sexual and  GBV, including ahead of 
the planned general elections in 2022.

Section 162 of Kenya’s penal code punishes consensual same-sex relations with 
up to 14 years in prison. The High Court rejected a constitutional challenge to the ban in May 2019. Act ivists have appealed the ru ling on grounds that section 162 
violates rights to equality, non-discrimination, human dignity, security, privacy, and health, all protected under Kenya’s  constitution. They are currently awaiting 
a hearing at the Court of Appeal. 
Key International Actors  
Kenya currently occupies two key intern ational and regional leadership roles. In 
January, Kenya began its  two-year term as a non-permanent mem ber of the 
United Nations Security Council (UNSC). President Kenyatta took over as chair of the East African Community (EAC) in February. With its forces in South Sudan and Somalia, Kenya joined other nations at the UNSC in July to endorse an African Union Comm ission of Inquiry into the alleged atrocities committed  in Ethiopia’s 
beleaguered Tigray region. Kenya’s Permanent Representative to the UN Martin Kimani urged parties in Tigray to lay down arms. He said Ke nya was loo king for-
ward to thorough investigations so that perpetrators could be held to account. 
Kenya received significant support to address the challenging impact of the 
Covid-19 pandemic from both bilateral and  multilateral partners. The United 
States, United Kingdom, China, European Union and individual European coun-tries such as Germany provided material, technical and financial support to aid Kenya’s response to the pandemic. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African Development Bank have variously provided Kenya with budgetary and project supports from the outset of the pandemic. In June 2021, 
the World Bank approved a $750 million budgetary support, in part to aid Kenya’s pandemic response.
396WORLD REPORT 2022Kosovo 
The Hague-based special court for Kosovo began its first war crimes trial in Sep-

Journalists continued to be targets of attacks, threats and intimidation, with per-petrators rarely held to account. T ensions between Serbia and Kosovo grew after 
Kosovo authorities ordered v ehicles to remove Serbia license plates when enter-
ing Kosovo. Discrimination against Roma, Ashkali, and Balkan Egyptian commu-nities remained a problem. 
Accountability for War Crimes  
In September, the Specialist Chambers f or Kosovo in The Hague began its first 
war crimes trial. The defendant, former Kosovo Liberation Army unit commander 
Salih Mustafa, is charged with murder, torture, cruel treatment, and arbitrary de-tention during the 1999 Kosovo  war.  
In a landmark de cision in July, the Pristin a Basic Court conv icted former Serb po-
liceman Zoran Vukotic of wartime sexual violence and involvement in forced ex-pulsions in 1999. Vuk otic was sent enced to 10 year s.  
In March, Kosovo police arrested a Koso vo Albanian with Serbian citizenship on 
suspicion of w ar crimes against the civi lian population du ring an operation by 
Serbian forces in 1999,  in which 147 civilians were killed.  
Also in March, the Basic Court in Pristin a convicted two former police officers, 
Zlatan Krstic and Destan Sh abanaj for their in volvement in a 1999  attack that 
killed four members of an ethnic Albanian family. They were sentenced to four-
teen-and-a-hal f-years and seven -year s’ imprisonment res pectively.  
Accountability of International Institutions 
There was no progress  during the year towards financially compensating mem-
bers of the Roma, Ashkali, and Balkan Egyptian communities who were victims of lead poisoning in now-closed camps for displaced persons established by the 
United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The Human Rights Advisor y Panel 
(HRAP), an independent international body set up to examine complaints of 
397HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHabuses by UNMIK, in 2016 recommended the United Nations pay individual com-
pensation and apologiz e to victims—the UN has done neither. Since its estab-
lishment in 2017 , only one state had contributed to the voluntary UN trust fund 
set up for community  assist ance projects.  
Treatment of Minorities  
Discrimination against Roma, Ashkali, and Balkan Egyptians in Kosovo remains a 
problem. 
The prosecution of six defendants charged  in the 2018 murder of Kosovo Serb 
politician Oliv er Ivanovic, continued  in the Basic Court in Pristin a with the indict-
ment confirmed  in May and the trial starting in July following delays in 2020. 
Four defendants are accused of having been part of a criminal group that organ-
ized the murder of Ivanovic. Two def endants stand accused of evidence-temper-

Mitrovica, northern Kosovo.  
Women’s Rights  
Domestic violenc e survivors continued to face  obstacles in obtaining protection

A 2018 mechanism set up to help  provide financial compensation for the esti-
mated 20,000 wartime su rvivors of  sexual violence, c ontinued to ha ve limited

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
The Centre for Equality and Liberty of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Community in Kosovo (CEL), in October expressed concern about inade-quate investigations into thre ats and hate speech against LGBT people and ac-

Pristina was approached by three unknown ass ailants, who spat in the act ivist’s 
face, screaming, “We are going to ki ll you.” A police inves tigation was pending at 
time of writing.  
Freedom of Media  
Between January and September, the Association of Journalists of Kosovo  regis-
tered 18 cases of threats, intimidation and violence against journalists and 
media outlets. At least nine cases were under investigation at time of writing, but investigations and prosecutions have been slow. 
One of the cases involves an assault on a journalist at Gazeta Insajderi, Visar 
Duriqi, who was physically attacked in Pristin a in February by three unknown as-

On July 5, Stat e Security authorities ar rested Jaber al-Sayer, an act ivist and  poet 
who faces charges including “insulting the emir” and “broadcasting false news.” 
Authorities reportedly released al-Sayer on July 13.  
Authoritie s harassed activists who advocate for the rights  of the Bidun commu-
nity. The Gulf Centre for Human Rights reported that on March 29 the Ministry of Justice informed prominent human rights  defender Hadeel Buqrais that there 
was a pending case against her on ch arges of public insults, def amation, and 
misuse of her mobile telephone in connection with two tweets from early August 
2020. In November 2020, the Department to Combat Electronic and Cyber Crime had summoned and interrogated Buqra is about these tweets. In May 2021, the 
Public Prosecution dismissed the charges and closed the case.  
On September 22, authorities released Abdo llah Fairouz, who worked on Bidun 
issues, after serving tw o-and-half years of a five-year pri son term for “insulting 
the emir.” 
Article 12 of the 1979 Public G atherings Law ba rs non-Kuwaitis fr om participating 
in public gatherings. The Gulf Center for Human Rights reported that on August 
401HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH11 and 12, the General Department of Criminal Investigation at the Ministry of In-
terior summoned 19 Bidu n act ivists f or questioning after they pa rticipated in 
weekly Saturday evening gatherings in Al-Erada Square. In 2021, the authorities 
also deported  at least two non-Kuwaiti residents for peaceful dissent.  
Women’s Rights, Children’s Rights, Sexual Orientation, 
Gender Identity  
Kuwait’s personal status law applies to Sunni Muslims, who make 
up most Kuwaitis. It discriminates against women in matters of marriage, di-vorce, and child custody, including a s tipulation that  women need permiss ion of 
a male guardian to marry and they can lose their right to financial maintenance from their husbands if they refuse to l ive with their husband without justifica-
tion. Women can only apply to the courts for a divorce on limited grounds while 
men can divorce women without any restrictions. The personal status rules that apply to Shia Muslims also discrimin ate against women. Kuwaiti women married 
to non-Kuwait is cannot  pass citiz enship to their children or spouses on an equal 
basis w ith Kuwaiti men.  
Although a record number of female candidates ran in the December 2020 Na-
tional Assembly elections, none were elected.  
According to the study by the Kuwait Society for Human Rights in May 2021, gen-
der-based violence increased during the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent re-strictions. In February, Kuwaiti women act ivists launc hed a nation wide online 
campaign called Lan Asket (“I will not be silent”) to speak out agains t harass-
ment, discrimination, and violence agains t women. Dozens of women’s testi-
monies about being stal ked, harassed, or ass aulted emer ged online. 
In April 2021, outrage and protests followed 
reports  that Farah Hamza Akbar had 
been killed after being kidnapped from her car during the day by a man her fam-ily had previously reporte d to the authorities for harass ment.  
Domestic violence continues to rem ain per vasive. W omen and girls who need to 
flee abuse have nowhere to turn. They can be reported to local police for “ab-
sence” if they leave their homes without their fami ly’s or guardian’s  permiss ion. 
Kuwait still has no shelters for survivors  of domestic violenc e, despite Kuwait’s 
national  assembly passing in 20 20 a Law on Protection from Domestic Violence, 
402WORLD REPORT 2022which included a p rovision that the state provide assistanc e for survivo rs includ-
ing establishing a shelter. Although the law provides penalties to combat do-
mestic violence and  assist ance for sur vivors, it falls s hort of c riminalizing 
domestic violence as such and does not  cover people in relationships outside of 
marriage, including engaged coup les or former partners. 
Kuwait’s penal code provides reduced  sentences for male violence against 
women. Article 153 allows men who kill their wife, daughter, sister, or mother 
upon finding them in the act of extra-marital sex to receive a reduced sentenced of a maximum of three years in prison or a fine of 3,000 Kuwaiti dinars (approxi-mately US$9,820). Article 182 also allows  an abductor who uses force, threat, or 
deception with the intention to kill, harm, rape, prostitute or extort the victim to avoid punis hment if he marries the victim w ith the perm ission of her guardian.   
The penal code also criminalizes sexual relations outside marriage and consen-
sual same-sex relations  between men. Transgender people can 
face one year in 
prison , a 1,000 Kuwaiti dinar fine ($3,293), or both, under  a 2007 penal code 
provision  that prohibits “imitating the opposite sex in any way.” Transgender 
people have been subjected to arbitrary arrest, degrading treatment, and torture while in police custody. On October 3, a court sentenced Maha al-Mutairi, a 
transgender woman, to two years in prison and a fine of 1,000 Kuwaiti dinars for “misusing phone communication” by “imitating the opposite sex” online under article 70 of the telecommunication law and article 198 of the penal code. 
The criminal code and the Child Rights Act permit corporal punishment of chil-
dren by their parents or legal caregivers. 
Stateless People  
The Bidun are a group of between 88,000 and 106,000  stateless people who 
claim Kuwaiti nationality, dating back to the foundation of the state in 1961. Re-jecting their claims to Kuwaiti nationality, the government refers to them as “ille-gal residents,” resulting in them facing ob stacles to obtaining civil 
documentation, receiving social services, and impairing their rights to health, education, and work.  
The Central System for the Remedy of Situations of Illegal Residents, the admin-
istrative body in charge of Bidu n affairs, has been iss uing temporary ID cards 
403HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHsince 2011. These ID cards often state that the cardholder possessed Iraqi, 
Saudi, Iranian, or other c itizenship, but it  was uncle ar how the agency  deter-
mined the individual’s alleged nationality and what due process procedures are available for Bidun to challenge the Central System’s determination. Over the past year there have been at least two reports of Bidun youth committing suicide after what Bidu n act ivists claim was the Central Syst em’s refusal to renew their 
ID cards or due to their difficult living conditions.  
Article 12 of the 1979 Public G atherings Law ba rs non-Kuwaitis fr om participating 
in public gatherings. The Gulf Centre for Human Rights reported that on August 11 and 12 that the General Department of Criminal Investigation at the Ministry of Interior summoned 19 Bidun act ivists f or questioning after they pa rticipated in 
weekly Saturday evening g atherings in Al-Erada Square.  
Migrant Workers  
Two-thirds of Kuwait’s population is comprised of migrant workers, who remain 
vulnerable to abuse, largely due to the kafala  (sponsorship) system which ties 
migrants’ visas to their employers and r equires that migrants get their employ-
ers’ consent to leave or change jobs. Migrant domestic workers continue to face additional forms of abuse including being fo rcibly confined in their employers’ 
homes, and verbal, physica l and sexual abuse.  
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, many migrant workers found themselves 
dismissed without their wages, trapped in the country, unable to leave due to travel rest rictions and more ex pensive  flight tickets, or dismissed from their jobs 
and deported. In April 2021, Migrant-rights.org 
reported  that migrant workers in 
the food and beverage sector were among those most affected, with many losing 
jobs, facing denial of wages for months or severe salary deductions.  
In 2020, the government said  that it seeks to reduce the number of migrant 
workers from 70 to 30 percent of the population.  In January, the Public Authority for Manpower reportedl y began implementing a 20 20 administr ative decision to 
prohibit issuing or renewing work permits for migrants aged 60 and above who hold only  high school dip lomas or below. On July 14, local  papers reported that 
the authorities decided to allow for the renewal  of work permits of migrant work-
ers over age 60 but for a high fee of 2,000 Kuwaiti dinar ($6,650) per year. Fol-
404WORLD REPORT 2022lowing citiz ens and res idents taking to soc ial media to oppo se the de cision cri-
tiquing it as extortion of the elderly, in August, local media reported  that officials 
were considering halving the fee to 1,000 Kuwaiti dinar (approximately $3,300).   
Government’s Respons e to the Covid-19 Pandemic  
Since April 2021, in response in the Co vid-19 pandemic, Kuwaiti authorities im-
posed various restrictions, including general loc kdowns. Several of these gov-
ernment actions have had a disproportionat e impact on already marginalized 
communities.  
In June 2020, Amnesty International reported  that the official contact tracing mo-
bile application used in Kuwait to track reported Covid-19 cases uses one of the most in vasive c entralized approaches, posing a threat to privacy. There are no 
general data protection laws in the country.  
Morbidity 
rates  during Covid have been higher among migrant workers. Reports  
indicate that migrant workers were not given equal access to Covid-19 vaccines based on the same health criteria as Kuwait citizens.    
The closure of schools and shift to online education in response to Covid-19 af-
fected the education of 800,000 students. Bidu n children, who are already so-
cially marginalized, reportedly have mor e difficulty accessing devices for online 
education. In September and October the government started reopening private and public schools.  
There have been several reports of Covid-19 outbreaks in Kuwait prisons. 
Accord-
ing to the US State Department, the authorities released more than 1,000 prison-
ers and asked several other countries to repatriate any of their nationals who had served more than half of their prison terms and have them serve the remain-der of their sentences at home to reduce prison overcrowding during the pan-demic.  
Climate Change Polices and Impacts  
Kuwait, the world’s sev enth-largest ex porter of c rude oil,  has the sixth-highest  
greenhouse gas emiss ions per capita globally, a consider able portion from air 
conditioning. As one of the world’s hottest and most water-stressed countries, Kuwait is particul arly vulnerab le to the impacts of climate ch ange. The incr easing 
405HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHfrequency and intensity of heat waves, decreased precipitation, and rising sea 
levels pose  risks to the right to health, life, water, and housing, especially of mi-
grant workers.  
Kuwait gener ates two-thirds of  its electric ity from burning oil but has no national 
climate ch ange plan and has yet to submit  its second Nation ally Determined 
Contribution (NDC), a P aris Agr eement-mandat ed, five-yea r, national  climate 
change action plan due at the end of 2020. Its first NDC contained no quantita-
tive targets. 
Key International Actors  
Kuwait has a bilat eral defense c ooperation agreement  with the United  States, 
and the US uses military bases in the country. Kuwait is a member of the Saudi-led coalition conducting mi litary operations  in Yemen. Kuwait  has not responded 
to Human Rights Watch  inquiries regarding what  role, if any, it  has played in un-
lawful attacks in Yemen. 
406WORLD REPORT 2022Kyrgyzstan 
In a year marked by Sadyr Japarov’s win at a snap presidential election in Janu-
ary, Kyrgyzstan adopted a new constitution th at includes pro visions undermin-
ing human rights norms and engaged in a short border conflict with Tajikistan.  
Throughout the year, Kyrgyzstan’s caretaker parliament adopted several prob-
lematic bills including one imposing unnecessary financial reporting require-ments on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and another overly broad bill penalizing “fal se” information. In F ebruary, the go vernment initi ated a massive 
legal rev iew that was rushed and failed to in volve a proper con sultation process.  
In late April, a border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan killed at least 41 
people, injured hundreds, and displaced thousands.  
Measures put in place to protect women and girls have yet to end impunity for 
domestic violence, which remains widesp read. An investigation into the death in 
custody of the wrongfully imprisoned human rights defender Azimjon Askarov in July 2020 was impr operly closed in May, but the case was r e-opened on or der of 
a court. Several foreign human rights workers and a foreign media correspon-
dent remain banned from Kyrgyzstan. In March, Kyrgyzstan repatriated 79 chil-dren, who were held in prisons in Iraq together with their mothers as Islamic State suspects. The returnees reportedly underwent rehabilitation before being 
placed with family members. 
Parliamentary Elections  
Two days after the disputed parliamentar y elections on October 4, 2020, and en-
suing protests, Kyrgyzstan’s Centra l Election Committee (CEC) annulled the out-
come and scheduled a rerun for Decem ber 20. However, on October 22, the 
caretaker parliament adopted amendments  postponing new parliamentary elec-
tions until sometime in 2021 to allow for constitutional reforms initiated by the 
then acting president Sadyr Japarov. The amendments were adopted in violation of procedural norms, rushed through three readings in parliament in one day. 
This allowed the caretak er parliament to continue p assing numerous laws, in-
cluding many that violate the country’s international human rights obligations—such as the modified editions of the criminal and criminal procedural codes, 
407HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHwith exce ssive c riminalization and decrease in the rights of detainees. Elections 
were scheduled for November 28, 2021.  
Constitutional Reform  
The Council of Eu rope’s (CoE) Venice Commiss ion and the Org anization for Secu-
rity and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights issued a joint opinion concluding that the constitution—adopted 
by referendum on April 21—contains  provisions threat ening the necessary bal-
ance of power and the protection of ind ividual freedoms, essential to democracy 
and rule of law.  
Several provisions directly violate intern ational human rights standards. Article 
10 prohibits activities, public events, and dissemination of information contrary to “moral values and the public consciousness of the people of Kyrgyzstan” and is incompatible with fundamental human rights to freedom of expression, as-sembly,  and associ ation. Another pro vision includes a requirement to  obtain ad-
vance perm ission fr om the authorities to hold pe aceful as semblies. 
Civil Society 
In June, parliament adopted a bill on NGOs  that imposes additional burdensome 
financial reporting r equirements on civil society  groups. Pres ident Japarov 
signed the bill into law in July. 
In May 2020, the State Committee on Nation al Security (GKNB) brought dubious 
forgery charges against the rights defender , Kamil Ruziev, after he spent two 
days in detention for interrogation as a witnes s. Ruziev had filed a lawsuit 
against the GKNB and the prosecutor’s office f or failing to investigate his com-
plaint that officials had psychologically  abused him and threatened him, includ-
ing at gunpoint, during his detention. The case against Ruz iev was sent to court 
in September 2020 and is ongoing after numerous postponements. 
On July 25, 2020, the human rights defender Azimjon Askarov died in custody. 
Askarov had served 10 years of a life sentence imposed after an unfair trial on 
politically motivated charges. The Kyrgyz Investigative Department of the State 
Penitentiary Service  was tasked w ith inves tigating h is death, which was prob-
408WORLD REPORT 2022lematic as the Penitentiary Service al so oversaw his detention. The inquiry that 
closed on May 28 concluded that Askarov  died from Covid-19-related complica-
tions and denied  that he was mistreated in prison. A Bish kek city di strict court 
ruled in August that the decis ion to close the inves tigation was unfounded and 
that the investigation should be r e-opened. In September, the prosecutor gen-
eral tasked the GKNB w ith the new inves tigation, under its super vision.  
Conflict at the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border  
A two-day border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in late April—the 
worst in Central Asia in decades—killed  over 40 people, most  of them civili ans, 
and injured hundreds.  
The conflict began over control of a crucial water-intake facility which diverts to 
Kyrgyzstan a small part of a river that  flows naturall y into Tajikist an, in line with a 
water-sharing protocol. About 58,000 people in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan fled their homes or were evacuated. Dozens of  houses and at least three schools 
were damaged or destroyed. The two countries quickly called a ceasefire and committed to rebuilding houses dam aged during the conflict in their respective 
territories.  
As of September, three nationals of Kyrg yzstan, ethnic Tajiks, and two nationals 
of Tajikistan were on trial in Kyrgyzstan for looting private property during the conflict. There are no reports of an impar tial investigation by Kyrgyzstan into 
whether its military violated the laws of war during the conflict. 
Freedom of Expression  
In 2021, journalists c ontinued to be ha rassed by law enfor cement, and in some 
cases threatened with criminal sanctions for critical reporting. Police detained at 
least four journalists covering the April constitutional referendum in Osh and Bishkek. In May, GKNB officers allegedly  harassed Kanat K animetov, a reporter 
and presenter at  independent tele vision broadca ster “Aprel,” and his fami ly, in 
connection to a criminal case on which he had reported. 
On August 23, president Sadyr Japarov signed into law a vague and overly broad 
bill on protection from “fal se information” that allows authorities, without judi-
409HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcial oversight, to order the removal of  information that officials consider “false” 
or “inaccurate” from internet platforms.  
In September, police detained act ivist and blogger Orozayym Narm atova for “ex-
cessive and unfair c riticis m of the gov ernment”, rel easing her la ter follo wing the 
intervention of  the human rights om budsman and civil society  protests.  
Labor Rights  
Parliament twice tried to push a restrictive trade union bill that had been stalled 
in parliament since 2019. The bill would grant the Federation of Trade Unions a monopoly over all federal-level union activity  and require industrial and regional 
trade unions to affiliate with the federation. It would undermine trade union plu-ralism and the right of trade unions to freely determine their structures and statutes. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and IndustriALL Global Union criticized the proposed law. President Japarov vetoed the bill twice, in May and August.  
Violence against Women and Girls  
Despite legislation, including amendments to the Criminal Procedural Code 
adopted in 2020, which provides better pr otections for victims of domestic vio-
lence and other violence against women and girls, authorities do not fully en-
force protective measures or hold perpetrators accountable. Impunity for domestic violence—the vast majority of which is committed by male perpetrators against women and girls—is still the norm.  
Police registered 7 ,665 cases during the first eight months of 2021, a 30 percent 
increase over the same period in 2020. Ca ses of violence against women and 
girls remain underreported and  survivors face  multiple barriers to accessing 
services and justice, such as insufficient  shelters and other essential services, 
dismissive  response by authorities, stigma, and attitudes that perpetuate harm-
ful stereotypes and practices, including by police, judicial officials, and govern-
ment and religious leaders.  
In April, the murder of  Aizada Kanatbekova, a you ng woman who was killed by a 
man who had kidnapped her for forced marriage, sent shock waves through the 
410WORLD REPORT 2022country, triggering public protests and renewed commitments by authorities to 
tackle so-called bride-kidnapping and domestic violence.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
In the second half  of 2020 , parliament amended the law on civil r egistry , delet-
ing a paragraph that previously allowed for transgender people to change their gender markers on official doc uments on the basis of medical cer tification. C ivil 
registry workers now have the di scretion to refuse applications for gender 
marker change. 
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues in Kyrgyzstan are often 
used as a scaremongering tactic by politicians to taint their opponents. In the run-up to the failed parliamentary elections in Kyrgyzstan in October 2020, a gay couple working for an opposition party was 
outed  as part of a smear campaign 
against it. 
While there is no direct discrimin ation on the b asis of se xual orient ation and/or 
gender identity in Kyrgyz legislation, Article 10 of Kyrgyzstan’s new constitution allows for indirect censorship of any LGBT-rights related activities, public events, or information as they may be deemed contrary to “moral values and the public consciousness of the people of Kyrgyzstan.” 
Disability Rights  
Despite ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities in 2019,  the government  has yet to adopt a comprehen sive plan 
on its implementation. A September 2021 p residential decree increased the 
monthly social benefit payments to people with disabilities, primarily benefiting various groups of children with certain types of disabilitie s. Children with dis-
abilities face significant barriers to inc lusive education, with on ly 1,067 enrolled 
in mainstream schools since the beginning of the year as part of a pilot project run by an NGO. Others remain in segregated  schools and residential institutions, 
or out of education altogether.  
411HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTorture  
Impunity for torture and ill-treatment remains the norm. According to statistics of 
the Kyrgyz National Center for Prevention of Torture, 77 allegations of torture were registered in the first eight months of 2021. In September, the center re-ported that conditions in pretrial det ention centers in Osh, Batken and Jalal 
Abad oblasts violated the human rights of detainees u nder the Kyrgyz law on 
“Order and conditions of detention of sus pects”—where four beds in a cell were 
shared by seven or eight detainees, some of whom spent months or years in such conditions. Women in the Jalal-Abad detention center complained about harass ment by offic ers.  
Abduction of Orhan Inandi  
Between May and June, Orhan  Inandi, a dual Turkish-Kyrgyz national living 
in Bishkek was abducted, forcib ly disappe ared, and ex trajudic ially transferred to 
Turkey. The actions included egregious viol ations of international and domestic 
law. Inandi is the director of Sapat network  of prestigious schools in Kyrgyzstan.  
On July 5, 2021, President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan alleged on a Turkish 
state TV ch annel that Inandi is part of the movement run by US-based cleric 
Fethullah Gülen, which Turkey deems a t errorist organization responsible for the 
July 2016 failed coup in the country. He stated that Inandi had been captured and taken to Turkey. Authorities in Kyrgyzstan said in September they were in-vestigating aspects of his enforced disappearance and were seeking access to him in jail in Turkey.   
Key International Actors  
In March, the special representative of  the United Nations secretary-general for 
Central Asia, Nat alia Gherman, visited Kyrgy zstan and during the meeting with 
President Sadyr Japarov noted that it is important to “conduct reforms in an in-clusive and transparent  manner,” ba sed on the princ iples of rule of law, human 
rights, and good governance.  
In May, after the escalation of border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, 
the European Union, OSCE, and the UN a ll offered  their assistanc e in resolving 
412WORLD REPORT 2022the conflict and responding to the immediat e consequences for the livelihoods 
of people on both sides of the border. 
In September, during its annual Human Rights Dialogue with the Kyrgyz Repub-
lic, the EU recalled the need to conduct an impartial and transparent investiga-
tion into the death of Azimjon Askarov and expressed its concerns over the controversial legislative initiatives th at limit civil society  and freedom of informa-
tion in contravention of the country’s obligations under relevant international conventions. In July, the US State Department spokesperson expressed deep concern over the new law imposing bu rdensome requir ements on civil soc iety 
groups. 
In November, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women urged Kyrgyzstan to review the law “On protection and defense against domestic violence” to ensure that it cove rs all forms of gender-based violence, 
taking into account the special needs of marginalized groups of women, includ-
ing women with disabilities and lesbi an, bisexual, and transgender women; to 
pursue efforts to prevent, protect  and assist victims, as well as to prosecute and 
adequately punish perpetrators, of bride k idnapping; and to reinstate the right 
of transgender persons, including women, to change the gender marker on their passport and other identity documents and in their personal identification num-ber, including by repealing the amendments of August 1, 2020, to the Law on Civil Registry.

“They Killed Us from the Inside”  
An Investigation into the August 4 Beirut Blast HUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Lebanon 
The human rights situation in Lebanon deteriorated further in 2021. More than 
80 percent of the country’s residents did not have access to basic rights, includ-ing health, education, and an adequate standard of living, such as adequate housing and electricity, accor ding to the United Nations. The World Bank has de-
scribed Leb anon’s cr isis as a “deliberate depress ion,” due to Lebanese leaders’ 
mismanagement and lack of effective policy actions, and ranked it among the top three most severe global financial crises since the mid-nineteenth century. 
The Lebanese pound  has lost 90 percent of  its value s ince October 20 19, eroding 
people’s ability to access basic goods, including food, water, health care, and 
education. Fuel shortages have caused widespread electricity blackouts, lasting up to 23 hours per day, and private generators—a costly alternative—have not been able to fill the gap, leaving large portions of the country in darkness for several hours per day. Hospitals, schools, and bakeries have struggled to oper-ate amid these energy  shortages.  
The Lebanese government remo ved or decreased subsidies on fuel, wheat, med-
icine, and other b asic goods, but it has failed to  implement an adequate social 
protection scheme to shield vulnerable res idents from the impact of steep price 
rises. Marginalized communities, including 
refugees , people with disabilities, 
migrant workers, and LGBTQ people , have been disproportionately impacted.  
No one has yet been held accountable for the catastrophic explosion in Beirut’s 
port on August 4, 2020, which killed at least 219 people and devastated half the city.  
Security forces  continued to use exce ssive and even lethal force to suppress 
protests, often with impunity. 
Women face systematic discrimination and violence due to the archaic national-
ity law and multiple religion-b ased personal status laws. Although Lebanon 
criminaliz ed sexual harass ment, the law falls short of  internation al standards.  
On September 10, Prime Minister Najib Mi kati formed a government, ending the 
13-month vacuum.  
415HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHBeirut Blast  
Following decades of government mismanagement and corruption at Beirut’s 
port, on August 4, 2020, one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history pul-verized the port and damaged over half the city. The explosion 
resulted from  the 
detonation of tons of ammonium nitrate, a combustible chemical compound commonly used in agriculture as a high nitrate fertilizer, but which can also be used to manuf acture explosive s. The Beirut port explosion ki lled at least 219 
people, wounded 7 ,000 people, and left hundreds with 
permanent disabilities . 
Human Rights Watch’s review of hundr eds of pages of official documents 
strongly suggests that some government officials were aware of the fatal disaster that the ammonium nitrate’s presence in the port could result in and tacitly ac-
cepted the risk to human life. This amounts to a violation of the right to life under international human rights law. 
Lebanese leaders have continued to 
obstruct and delay  the ongoing domestic in-
vestigation, shielding high-level officials from accountability. In February 2021, a court dismissed the judge appointed to le ad the investigation after two former 
ministers whom he had charged filed a complaint against him. While judge Tarek 
Bitar was appointed a day later, the political est ablishment  has similarly started 
a 
campaign against him  after he made requests to charge and summon for ques-
tioning senior political and security officials. In October, seven people  were 
killed and dozens injured after gu nfire erupted during a demonstration that 
Hezbollah and its allies called for to demand the removal of Bitar.  
Human Rights Wa tch has al so document ed a r ange of procedural and systemic 
flaws  in the domestic investigation that render it incapable of credibly delivering 
justice, including flagrant political inter ference, immunity for high-level political 
officials, lack of respect for fair tria l standards, and due process violations.  
Families of the victims and local and international rights groups have called for  a 
Human Rights Council-mandated int ernational, independent investigation, into 
the Beirut Blast.  
In December 2020, the World Bank, United Nations, and European Union an-
nounced an innovative model for disbursing aid to Lebanon in the aftermath of 
416WORLD REPORT 2022the Beirut Blast, the Reform, Recovery, and Reconstruction Framework (3RF), that 
aims to disburse funds dir ectly to nongovernmental groups and businesses.  
Financial and Economic Crisis 
Lebanon’s financ ial and economic  crisis is cau sed by the Leb anese authorities’ 
“deliberately inadequat e policy responses,”  according to the World Bank.  
Between June 2019 and June 2021, the inflation rate  was 281 percent. Food 
prices  alone increased by 550 percent between August 2020 and August 2021.  
Meanwhile, the national currency lost 90 percent of its pr e-crisis v alue , and 
banks c ontinue to impose arbitrary restrictions  on cash withdrawals.  
In 2019, the government decided to subsizide  vital imports, such as fuel, wheat, 
and medicine. But in 2021, the central bank ran out of money  to finance these 
imports, causing residents to experience severe shortages . Fuel shortages have 
caused widespread electricity blackouts , lasting up to 23 hours per day. Hospi-
tals, schools , and bakeries  have struggled to operate amid these supply and 
electricity shortages, and residents had to endure hours-long queues for neces-
sities, such as fuel and bread. 
The impacts of the cr isis on residents’ rights have been ca tastrophic and un-
precedented. The UN estimates that by March 2021, 78 percent  of Lebanon’s 
population  was in poverty— triple  the estimated number in 2020. Thirty-six  per-
cent  of the population live in extreme poverty—up from 8 percent in 2019 and 23 
percent in 2020.  
The Lebanese government provided almost no support to families struggling to 
cope with the economic cr isis, exacerbated by the Covid-1 9 pandemic, fumbling 
a World Bank loan  intended to provide emergency r elief to vulnerable Lebanese 
and repeatedly delaying  a ration card program to help families cope with the lift-
ing of subsidies. 
Healthcare Crisis  
The economic cr isis has had a devast ating impact on the healthcare sector. Med-
icines and medical supplies, most  of which are imported, are in short supply , 
leading to several  deaths  due to lack of medication and threatening the lives of 
417HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHpatients with illnesses, such as cancer . The fuel and electricity shortages in the 
country have pushed  hospitals to “ imminent disaster ,” with hospitals perma-
nently closing  or warning  that they will be forced to cease their operations, 
threatening the lives of hundreds . 
The value of nu rses and doct ors’ salaries has dec lined rapidly, triggering a mass 
exodus,  placing a heavy burden  on the remaining workforce. The Covid-19 pan-
demic also placed an additional strain  on a healthcare sector already in crisis . 
Lebanese authorities have shown a callous disregard  for the protection of 
healthcare workers at the fr ont lines of the pandemic.  
Despite the enormous pressures facing hospitals, the government is not disburs-
ing billions  of dollars that it owes them.  
A national vaccination campaign  was rolled out in mid-February and, as of No-
vember 15, around 30 percent of the population had been vaccinated against Covid-19. However, the government’s program risks 
leaving behind  marginalized 
communities, including refugees and migrant workers. 
Freedom of Assembly and Expression 
Anti-government protests, which began in Oc tober 17 , 2019, continued amid the 
rapidly deteriorating economic and political situation.  
In January, the Internal Security Forces (ISF) used force  to disperse protests that 
turned violent over the rapidly deteriorating economic conditions, exacerbated by Covid-19 lockdown measures, in one of  Lebanon’s poorest cities, Tripoli. They 
fired teargas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition at protesters, injuring hun-dreds and 
killing one protester .   
Military Intelligence forcibly disappeared and allegedly tortured  detainees who 
were participating in these protests. The milit ary prosecution charged at least 35 
of the protesters, including tw o children, with terrori sm before the military 
courts, which are inherently unfair. 
Journalis ts, media workers, and  activis ts in Lebanon—especia lly critics of the 
ruling elite and established po litical parties—are coming under increasing threat  
both by private actors, with the authorities un willing or unable to protect them, 
and directly by government authoritie s, often acting with impunity. 
418WORLD REPORT 2022Lokman Slim, a pr ominent intel lectual and  Hezbollah critic , was assassinated  in 
February by u nidentified assail ants. There has been no meaningful progress in 
the investigation.  
Women’s Rights  
Women continue to face discrimination under 15 distinct religion-based personal status laws. Discrimination includes inequality in access to divorce, child cus-tody, and inheritance, and property rights. Unlike men, Lebanese women cannot 
pass on their nationality  to foreign husband s and children.  
In December 2020, parliament passed a law 
criminaliz ing sexual  harass ment  
which provided import ant protections  by making sexual harass ment a c rime and 
outlining whistleblower protections, but the law fails to meet international stan-
dards including th at it should have  sought to tack le harass ment at w ork through 
labor laws, occupational safety and health laws, and equality and nondiscrimi-nation laws. Parliament also 
amended the domestic violence  law to expand its 
scope to include violence related to—but  not necessarily committed during—
marriage, enabling women to seek protection from their ex-husbands. But it still 
does not criminalize marital rape. 
Migrant Workers 
An estimated 250,000 migrant domestic workers, primarily from Ethiopia, the 
Philippines, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, ar e excluded from Lebanon’s labor law 
protections, and their status in the country is regulated by the restrictive kafala  
(sponsorship) system , which ties migrant workers’ legal residency to their em-
ployer. 
Abuse against migr ant domestic workers has increased  amid Lebanon’s eco-
nomic cr isis and  the Covid-19 pandemic, including employers  forcing domestic 
workers to work without pay or at high ly reduced salaries, confining them to the 
household, to work long hours without rest or a day off, and verbal, physical and sexual abuse. The Internation al Labour Or ganiz ation has 
warned  that migrant 
workers in Lebanon now face conditions that  “greatly increase their risk of enter-
ing forced or bonded labor.”  
419HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
LGBTQ people participated prominently  in the nationwide protests that began on 
October 17 , 2019. By taking their struggle to the streets, through chants, graffiti, and public discussions, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have moved demands of their rights from the margins to mainstream discourse. 
However, Article 534 of the penal code punishes “any sexual intercourse con-
trary to the order of nature” with up to one year in prison. Transgender women in Lebanon face 
systemic violence and discrimination  in accessing basic services, 
including employment , health care, and  housing. The economic  crisis, com-
pounded by Covid-19 lockdown measures, disproportionately affected  LGBT peo-
ple. 
General Security forces issued entry bans , which remain in effect to date, to the 
non-Lebanese attendees of a 2018 conference that advances LGBT rights.  
Refugees 
Lebanon hosts nearly 900,000 registered  Syrian refugees, and the government 
estimates another 500,000 live in the country informally. Only 20 percent  of Syr-
ian refugees have legal  residency, making m ost of them vulner able to harass-
ment, arrest, detention, and deportation.  
The government continues to pursue policies  designed to coerce Syrian refugees 
to leave, and  the acute economic cr isis and st aggering inflation have made it ex-
ceedingly difficult for refugees to aff ord the most basic necessities; 90 percent  of 
Syrian families in Lebanon l ive in extreme pove rty, relying on inc reasing levels of 
debt to survive. 
Although the Lebanese government  continues to publicly state its commitment 
to the principle of nonrefoulement , it has deported more than 6,000 Syrians  in 
recent years. 
According to the Lebanese Pales tinian Dialogue Committee, there are approxi-
mately 174,000 Palestinian refugees  living in Lebanon, where they continue to 
face restrictions, including on their right to work and own property.  
420WORLD REPORT 2022Syrian refugees who returned to Syri a  from Lebanon between 2017 and 2021 
faced grave human rights abuses  and persecution at the h ands of the Syrian gov-
ernment and affiliat ed militias. 
Childrens’ Rights 
Many Lebanese and nearly all Syrian refugee children received no meaningful 
education  as the government closed schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic with-
out ensuring access to distance learning. Children with disabilities  were particu-
larly hard hit, as they could not access remote education on an equal b asis w ith 
others amid a lack of government support.  
The authorities’ planning failures  delayed the start of the 2021-22 school year to 
October 11 and led to concerns public schools would not remain open. 
Corporal punishment of children  was widespre ad and permitted u nder the crimi-
nal code.   
Legacy of Past Conflicts and Wars 
Despite a 2018 law creating an independent n ational comm ission to investigate 
the fate of the estimated 17 ,000 Lebane se kidnapped or disappeared during the 
country’s civil war, the government has yet to allocate a budget  for the commis-
sion to commence its work.  
The Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which in 2020 convicted a member of Hezbol-
lah for his role in the killing of f ormer Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 
21 others in 2005, risked shutting do wn amid funding difficulties. Although tri-
bunal officials announced in October that they had secured sufficient funding  to 
handle a prosecution appeal of the acquittal of two other suspects in the Hariri case, the tribunal’s  operations remain uncertain after that due to funding con-
straints.
 
Key International Actors 
Syria, Iran, and other regional powers maintain influence in Lebanon through their support of local political allies and proxies. 
421HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTensions with Israel along Lebanon’s southern border remain high, and hostili-
ties flared up in May  and August . A Lebanese man was shot and killed  by Israeli 
forces after he tried to cross a security fence on the border with Israel. Israel con-
tinues to frequently violate Lebanese airspace . 
In July, the EU adopted a framework  for targeted sanctions  against Lebanese offi-
cials responsible for obstructing the formation of a government, the improve-ment of accountability and good governance, and for serious financial misman agement, but no individual or entity  has been design ated.  
The United Sta tes has c ontinued to sanction individuals for 
links to Hezbollah , 
and in October, sanctioned two Lebanese businessmen and one lawmaker  for 
contributing to “the breakdown of good governance and the rule of law in 
Lebanon.” 
On September 16, the European Parliament adopted a resolution  describing the 
dire situation in Lebanon as a “man-made disaster” and calling for the establish-ment of an int ernational  fact-finding m ission into the Beirut Blast and targeted 
sanctions against corrupt Lebanese officials. 
In October, several Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, 
expelled the Lebanese am-
bassadors  and banned all Lebanese imports in response to critical comments 
made by a Lebanese minister about the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. 
Lebanese security  agencies continue to re ceive assist ance from a r ange of inter-
national donors, including the United States , European Union, United Kingdom, 
France, and Saudi Arabia. 
422WORLD REPORT 2022Libya 
After five  months of UN-brokered  political ta lks betw een Libyan st akeholders, 
the country’s House of Representative s swore in on March 15 a new interim au-
thority, the Government of National Unity (GNU).  
As of October, the first  round of a two-round  presidential election was due to 
take place on December 24. Parliamentary elections were due to take place 52 days after the first round of presidential elections.   
The country reeled from continued mass displac ement, dangers caused by 
newly-laid landmines, and the destruction of critical infrastructure, including healthcare and schools. Hundreds of people remain m issing, including many 
civili ans, and the authorities made grim disc overies of 
mass graves  containing 
dozens of bodies that remain unidentified. 
Migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in Libya faced arbitrary detention, dur-
ing which many experienced ill-treatment, sexual assault, forced labor, and ex-tortion by groups linked with the Government of National Unity’s Interior Ministry, members of armed grou ps, smugglers, and traffickers. 
Political Process and Elections  
UN-facilitat ed political ta lks involving 75 Liby an stakeholder s at the Libyan Politi-
cal Dialogue Forum  (LPDF) since November 2020 culminated in the nomination 
of the GNU. The new interim authority replaced the  Government of National Ac-
cord  and the Interim Government in eastern Libya.  
While members of a joint military c ommiss ion known as the 5+5 were negotiat-
ing the merging of Libyan fight ers into a unified force, the Libyan Arab Armed 
Forces (LAAF), the armed group under the command of General Khalifa Hiftar, re-mained in control of eastern Libya and parts of the south.  
The GNU’s core mandate is to conduct  presidential and parliamentary elections 
on December 24 and to implement a c easefire agreement from October 2020 be-
tween parties. As of October, the House of Representatives (HOR) passed a law 
for electing a president on December 24, and a separate law on electing a new parliament, paving the way for national elections. The High Council of the State, 
423HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmandated to approve elections laws per political agreements, contested the leg-
islation citing lack of consultation.  
Libya remains without a permanent constitution, with only the 2011 constituent 
covenant in force. A  draft constitution  proposed by the elected  Libyan Constitu-
tion Drafting Asse mbly in July 2017 has yet to  be put to a nation al refer endum. As 
of October, no date had been scheduled for the referendum. 
The constitution al cham ber of the Supr eme Court has rem ained shutter ed since 
2014 due to armed conflict. The lack of a constitutional court to review and re-voke legislation deemed unconstitutional, including elections-related legisla-tion, only deepens  Libya’s constit utional crisis.  
Armed Conflict and War Crimes  
The October 2020 ceasefire agreement between former Government of National 
Accord and Hiftar’s LAAF stipulated the departure of all foreign fighters from the 
country. According to the UN m ission in Libya, as of September, thousands of 
foreign fighters  from Syria, Russia, Ch ad, and Sudan, including members of pri-
vate military companies, remained in Libya.  
Since the discovery of mass graves in the town Tarhouna  after the end of the 
armed conflict in June 2020, Libyan authorities  said they had retrieved more 
than 200 bodies from more th an 555 mass graves as of Oc tober. The Pu blic Au-
thority for Search  and Identification of Missing Persons as of October had yet to 
confirm how many individuals were identified based on DNA matching or other means, such as clothing.  
The use of landmines during the armed conflict  in Tripoli and surroundings, re-
portedly by the W agner Group, a Ru ssian gov ernment-linke d company, has 
killed 
and maimed  dozens of people and deterred  families from returning to their 
homes. In September, eight members of one family  were injured when a land-
mine exploded near their home in southern Tripoli. According to a March
 report  by the UN Panel of Experts on Libya, internationally banned an-
tipersonnel landmines manufactured in Ru ssia and never before seen in Libya 
were brought into the country and used in Libya in 2019 and early 2020. 
424WORLD REPORT 2022Judicial System and Detainees  
Libya’s c riminal justice system rem ained dysfu nctional in some areas due to 
years of fighting and political  divis ions. Where prosec utions and tria ls took 
place, there were serious due process conc erns and military courts continued to 
try civili ans. Judges, prosecutor s and lawyers re mained at  risk of harass ment and 
attacks by armed groups. Libyan courts ar e in a limited position to resolve elec-
tion disputes, including registration and results. 
Libya’s Justice Ministry as of August held 12,300 detainees, including women 
and children, in 27 prisons under their control and other detention facilities “ac-knowledged” by the GNU, according to the 
UN Support Miss ion in Libya (UN-
SMIL) . Forty-one percent of the detainees were held in arbitrary, long-term 
pre-trial detention, according to UNSMIL. Armed  groups held thousands of oth-
ers in irregular detention faci lities. Prisons in Libya are marked by inhumane 
conditions such as overcrowding and ill treatment. 
Libyan authorities in March deported to Tunisia 10 Tunisian women and 14 chil-
dren  held in Libyan prisons, some for more than 5 years, for having ties to sus-
pected members of ISIS.  
The Libyan Supreme Court in May annulled a 2015 verdict  against Gaddafi-era of-
ficials whose prosecution and trials for their roles during the 2011 revolution had been marred by due process violations. Muammar Gaddafi’s son Saif al-Islam 
was among nine sentenced to death. The Supreme Cour t ordered a retrial, yet at 
time of writing none of the defendants had appeared in court. 
Authorities in western Libya on September 5 released 
eight detainees  linked 
with former leader Muammar Gaddafi held since 2011, including one of 
Gaddafi’s sons, Al-Saadi, held since 2014 after his extradition from Niger. A Tripoli appeals court in April 2018 had clea red Al-Saadi of all charges, including 
first degree murder, yet he remained held in arbitrary detention and subjected to 
ill-treatment   for three more years.  
International Justice and the ICC  
The International Criminal Court’s (ICC) former prosecutor  in May reported to the 
Security Council that members of her office had travelled to Libya and inter-
425HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHviewed witnesses but she did not announce any new arrest warrants against 
Libyan suspects.  
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, wanted by the ICC since 2011 for serious crimes during the 
2011 uprising, remains a fugitive and Libya remains under legal obligation to sur-render him to the Hague.  
Al-Tuhamy Khaled, former head of the Libyan Internal Security Agency and 
wanted by the ICC for crimes he alleged ly committed in 2011, reportedly died in 
Cairo in February; 
Mahmoud el-Werfalli , a commander linked with the LAAF and 
wanted by the ICC f or multiple killings in eastern Libya, was reporte dly killed in 
March in Benghazi by unidentified armed men.  
Khalifa Hiftar faces three separate lawsuits  filed in a US District Court in Virginia 
by families who allege their loved ones were killed or tortured by his forces in Libya after 2014. In July, the judge ruled that Hiftar cannot claim head-of-state-
immunity in his defense.  
The Libya  Fact-Finding M ission (FFM) establi shed by the UN Human Rights Coun-
cil (HRC) in June 2020 to investigate alleged violations and abuses since 2016 only became fully operational in June due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pan-demic. On October 3, the FFM issued its 
report , which found that “several parties 
to the conflicts violated International H umanitarian Law and potentially commit-
ted war crimes.”  
On October 11, the HRC renew ed the miss ion’s mandat e for an addition al nine 
months to allow completion of its investigations.  
Death Penalty  
The death penalty is stipulated in over 30 articles in Libya’s penal code, includ-
ing for acts of speech and associ ation. No death sentences have been carried 
out since 2010 , although both military and  civilian cour ts continued to impose 
them. 
Freedom of Association  
Libya’s Penal Code  levies severe punishments, including the death penalty, for 
establis hing “ unlawful” associ ations, and prohibits Liby ans from joining or es-
426WORLD REPORT 2022tablishing international organizations unless they receive government permis-
sion.  
Presidential Decree 286  on regulating NGOs, passed in 2019 by the former Presi-
dential Council of the GNA, includes burdensome registr ation requirements and 
stringent regulations on funding. Fundraising inside and outside Libya is prohib-ited. The decree mandates onerou s advance notification for group members 
wanting to attend events. The Tripoli-based 
Commission of Civil Society , tasked 
with regist ering and approving civic organiz ations, has sweep ing powers to in-
spect documents and cancel the regis tration and work permits of domestic and 
foreign organizations.  
Freedom of Speech and Expression  
Authorities in eastern Libya on Sept ember 11 released freelance photojournalist 
Ismail Abuzreiba al-Zway , who had been detained since December 2018. In May 
2020, a Benghazi military court had sentenced him in a secret trial to 15 years in prison for  “communicating with a TV station that supports terrorism.” The Gen-eral Command of the LAAF 
reportedly  granted al-Zway amnesty, but the condi-
tions of his release were not publicized. 
In October, the Libyan parli ament passed a cybercrime law. The final text is not 
available but an e arlier draft c ontains overbroad provis ions and dr aconian pun-
ishments including fines and imprisonment that could violate freedom of speech.  
A number of 
provisions in Libyan laws  unduly restrict freedom of speech and ex-
pression including criminal penalties for defamation of officials, the Libyan na-
tion and flag, and insulting religion.  The penal code stipulates the death penalty for “promoting theories or principle s” that aim to overthrow the political, social 
or economic system. 
Human Rights Defenders  
In April, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), responding to a complaint filed in 2017 by 
Libyan human rights de-
fender Magdulien Abaida , found that Libya had violated the human rights of an 
427HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHactivist “by fai ling to investig ate and prosec ute her unlawful ar rest and torture by 
a militia group affiliat ed with the government.” In August 2012, the armed group 
Martyrs of 17 February Brigade, had seized Abaida from a hotel in Benghazi dur-ing a workshop and over the course of  five days moved her between different 
military compounds while subjecting her to threats, ha rass ment, insults and 
beatings. Abaida fled  Libya soon after the group relea sed her and was granted 
asylum in the United Kingdom.  
Mansour Mohamed Atti al-Maghribi , a civic activis t and head of the Red Crescent 
Society in the ea stern town of Ajda biya, has been m issing sinc e June 3 when 
unidentified armed  men seized him while he was driving in the town. According 
to a joint submiss ion to the GNU in July  by two United Nations s pecial rappor-
teurs and the Working Group on Enforced Disappearances, the Internal Security 
Agency (ISA) in Ajda biya had previousl y harassed al-Maghribi and subject ed him 
to intimidation. ISA agents in December 2020 and in February had summoned him for questioning on h is civil society work, and in April the ISA briefly arrested 
him for “promoting foreign agendas.” As of October, the GNU had yet to re-
spond.  
Women’s Rights, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity  
Libyan law does not specifically criminaliz e domestic violence. Corporal punish-
ment of children remains common. Libya’s  Family Code discriminates against 
women with respect to marriage, divorce, and inheritance.  
The penal code allows for a reduced sentence for a man who kills or injures his 
wife or another female relative because he suspects her of extramarital sexual relations. Under the penal code, rapists can escape prosecution if they marry their victim. The 
2010 nationality law  stipulates that on ly Libyan men can pass 
on Libyan nationality to their children.  
Online violence ag ainst women has reportedly g rown steadily in recent years, 
often escalating to physical attacks, with no laws in place to combat the prob-lem.  
The penal code prohibits all sex ual acts outside marriage, including consensual 
same-sex relations, and punishes them with flogging and up to five years in prison. 
428WORLD REPORT 2022Internally Displaced Persons  
As of October, the International Org anization for Migration (IOM) estimated there 
were  212,593 internally displaced  people in Libya, or 42,506 families, with the 
largest number in Benghazi, followed by Tripoli and then Misrata. 
They include many of the 48,000 former residents of the town of Tawergha, who 
were driven out by anti-Gaddafi groups from Misrata in 2011. Despite reconcilia-tion agreements w ith Misrat a authorities, massive and deliber ate destruction of 
the town and its infrastructure and the scarcity of public services by consecutive interim governments have been the main deterrent  for the vast majority to return 
to their homes.  
Migrants, Refugees, and Asylum Seekers  
Between January and September, at least 46,626 people  arrived in Italy and 
Malta via the Central Mediterranean Route, most of whom had departed from Libya, according to the International  Organization for Migration (IOM), which 
said arrivals in Malta and Italy in 2021 had been consistently higher when com-pared with the same period in 2019 or 2020. The organization 
recorded 1,118 
deaths  off the shores of Libya between January and September 30. 
The IOM identified 610,128 migrants in Libya as of October. According to the UN 
refugee agency, UNHCR, over 41,000 including more than 15,000 children were 
registered asylum seekers and refugees  as of October. Between January and 
September, UNHC R assisted 345 vu lnerable refugee s and asylum seekers to de-
part Libya, and more than 1,000 ref ugees and asylum seekers had been identi-
fied as a priority for  humanitarian evacuations.  
The European Union continued to collabor ate with abu sive Liby an Coast Guard 
forces, providing speedboats, training, and other support to intercept and return thousands of people to Libya. As of October, 27 ,551 people were 
disembarked  in 
Libya after the LCG intercept ed them, according to UNHCR. 
Migrants, asylum seekers and refugees were  arbitrarily detained in inhumane 
conditions in facilities run by the GNA’s Interior Ministry and in “warehouses” 
run by smugglers and traffickers, where they we re subjected to forced labor, tor-
ture and other ill-treatment, extortion, and sexual assault. At least 5,000 were held in official detention centers in Libya as of August, according to IOM.  
429HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn June, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) reported that its staff had witnessed 
shooting by guards in one facility as well as repeated incidents of ill-treatment, physical abuse, and violence in two migrant detention centers in Tripoli, in Al-
Mabani and Abu Salim, le ading MSF to t emporarily 
withdraw  from these centers.  
On October 1, authorities conducted raids in Hay al-Andalous municipality in 
Tripoli on houses and other s helters used by migrants and asylum seekers to 
curb irregular migration, arresting 5,152 people including women and  children, 
according to IOM. One man was reporte dly killed and 15 people injured during 
the raids. On October 8, during a riot in al-Mabani prison in Tripoli that resulted 
in a mass break -out of thousands of detainees, guards shot to de ath at l east six 
migrants and injured at least 24, accor ding to the IOM. As of October, thousands 
remained in front of the closed UNHCR headquarters in Tripoli protesting condi-
tions and demanding shelter and evacuations outside of Libya.  
UNHCR resumed resettlements of refugees and humanitarian evacuations to 
Niger as of November 3.  
Key International Actors  
The UN Sanctions Committee’s Panel of Experts report from March  found that all 
Libyan parties as well as Egypt, the United  Arab Emirates, Jordan, Syrian Arab Re-
public, Russia and Turkey had violated the arms embargo. The panel said “viola-tions are extensive, blat ant and w ith complete disrega rd for the sanctions 
measures. Their control of the entire supply chain complicates detection, disrup-tion or interdiction.” 
In March, the European Union put on its 
sanctions list  the brothers Mohammed 
and Abderrahim al-Kani, and their Kaniyat Mi litia, for extrajudicial killings and 
disappearances in the town of Tarhouna between 2015 and 2020. Mohamed al-
Kani  was reportedl y killed du ring a raid by armed men on his dwelling in Beng-
hazi in July. In April, the EU lifted sanctions against Khalifa Ghwell , a former 
prime minister. In June, the EU extended f or two years the mandate of the Euro-
pean Integrat ed Border Ma nagement A ssistanc e Mission in Libya  (EUBAM Libya), 
tasked w ith assis ting Libyan authorities in border management, la w enforcement 
and criminal justice. 
430WORLD REPORT 2022In June high representatives, including from Germany, the UN, Egypt, France, 
Italy, Russia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and the Euro-pean Union, convened for the Second Berlin Conference on Libya, which aimed 
to ensure implementation of the previousl y negotiated political roadmap and 
ceasefire agreement. Among the 
conclusions  was a call on Libyan authoritie s to 
conduct judicial reviews of all detainees and the immediate release of all those 
unlawfully  or arbitrari ly detained.  
US Congress in October passed two amendments to the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for 2022 requiring the president to review violations of the Libya arms embargo for sanctions per Exec utive Order, and another requiring the US 
Department of State to report on war c rimes and torture committed by US citi-
zens in Libya. Hiftar is believed to hold US citizenship. 
UN Security Council in October added 
Osama al-Kuni Ibrahim  to the Libya sanc-
tions list in his capacity as de facto manager of the Al-Nasr Migrant Detention Center in Za wiya f or directly eng aging in, or providing suppor t to commit acts 
that violate international humanitarian law and human rights abuses. Violations include torture, sexual and gender-based  violence, and human trafficking. 
431HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMalaysia 
Faced with political instability, the Ma laysian government resorted to heavy-
handed tactics, investigating and arbitrarily  arresting those critical of the govern-
ment and its policies, pursuing a ha rdline anti-migrant policy, and threatening 
enhanced action against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. In August, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin resigned  and was replaced by Ismail 
Sabri, but there was little change in the gov ernment’s approach to human rights. 
Attacks on Human Rights Defenders  
The government continued to use a range of broad and vaguely worded laws, in-
cluding the Sedition Act and section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA), to prosecut e critical speech. 
On April 23, 2021, police arrested graphic ar tist and activist 
Fahmi Reza  for a 
Spotify playlist he had created as a satirical response to a controversial tweet by Malaysia’s queen. After a four-month sedition investigation, the 
police dropped 
the case . Reza was arrested again on Octo ber 4 in connection with a caricature 
of the Malaysian prime minister.  
  
In May 2021, the authorities opened an investigation into  political cartoonist 
Zulfikar Anwar U lhaque, kno wn as Zunar,  for alleged violations of the CMA and 
penal code section 505(c) for a satirical drawing that mocked the Kedah state chief minister. 
In July, the authorities opened investigations into 
the creators of a short ani-
mated film  depicting the  abuse that one boy said  he suffered in police custody, 
for criminal defamation and other violations of the penal code. The same month, authorities 
formally charged act ivist Heidy Quah  with violating the CMA for a 
June 2020 Facebook post alleging poor treatment of refugees at an immigration detention center.  
Those participating in peaceful protests ha ve also been the target of police in-
vestigations. 
432WORLD REPORT 2022On April 24, authorities  arrested  activis t Mukmin Nantang and  six others for 
protesting the 14-day extension of strict mo vement control orders in a village in 
Sabah. On July 6, police announced they were investigating  for sedition and 
other offenses the “black flag” campaign, which urged people to display black flags to voice their disappointment with the government. At least 31 people who participated in a black flag vehicle convoy on July 24 were 
summoned for ques-
tioning .  
On July 21, a youth coalition  announced  it would hold a protest on July 31 against 
the government’s handling of the Covid-1 9 pandemic. On July 29, police  arrested 
youth act ivist Sar ah Irdina  at her home. On the same day, police questioned 
three coalition members  under the CMA and a penal code section criminalizing 
“making st atements condu cive to  public mi schief.”  
On August 19, 31 people who were holding an outdoor candlelight vigil for those 
who died of Covid-19 were forcibly  detained by police . At least one participant 
subsequently  filed a police report  over physical injuries allegedly caused by the 
police.

Freedom of the press declined during the year. On February 18, the country’s highest court held online news portal Malaysiakini in contempt of court for five comments posted by readers, even though the portal removed the comments shortly after being notified of their presence. The court imposed a 
fine of 
RM500,000  (US$124,000). The authorities opened a c ontempt investigation into 
the outlet’s editor-in-chief, Steven Gan, for commenting on the court’s ruling.  
In May, the police summoned two Malaysiakini  journalists  for questioning 
about their coverage of alleg ations that  police brutality  was the cause of  a death 
in detention. In July, they summoned Boo-Su Lyn  of health care news portal Code 
Blue for questioning over an article about a Covid-19 outbreak at a vaccination center. 
On July 2, the Federal Court 
upheld a defamation ruling  against Malaysiakini in a 
decision that narrowly construed the common law public interest defense, pos-ing a serious risk to media freedom. The case, brought by Raub Australian Gold 
433HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMining Company, related to articles and videos posted by Malaysiakini about the 
possible impact of air po llution from a gold mine.  
Police Abuse and Impunity 
Police abuse of suspects in custody continues to be a serious problem, as does 
a lack of accountability for such off enses. The standard of care for those in de-
tention is problematic, with detainees dying of treatable illnesses. According to 
the home minister, as of August, 42 people had died in custody , with 28 of those 
deaths in immigration detention centers.  
Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Trafficking Victims  
Malaysia has not r atified the 1951 Re fugee Conv ention. Over 179,000 refugees 
and asylum seekers , mostly from Myanmar, are registered with the United Na-
tions High Comm ission for Ref ugees (UNHCR) office but are not  granted legal sta-
tus and remain unable to work or enroll in government schools.  
The government has denied UNHCR acce ss to immigration detention centers 
since August 2019, and the home minister has rejected calls  for access. 
Malaysia’s Home Ministry reported that, as of October 26, 2020, 756 children 
were being held in immigration detention  facilities nationwide, including 326 
from Myanmar who are detained without parents or guardians. In May, the 
Suhakam child commissioner expressed concern  that Rohingya girls who had 
been trafficked to Malaysia as child brides were being detained in an immigra-tion detention center. In February, 
Malaysia deported 1086 Myanmar nationals  
just weeks after a coup overthrew that country’s elected government.  
The immigration authorities conducted repeated raids and  detained thousands  
of undocumented workers, despite concerns that doing so would discourage them from seeking vaccination or treatment for Covid-19.  
The United States 
downgraded Malaysia to Tier 3  in its annual Trafficking in Per-
sons report, noting th at the gov ernment was “not  making significant  efforts” to 
eliminate trafficking.  
434WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Religion  
Malaysia restricts the rights of followers of any branches of Islam other than 
Sunni, with those following Shia or other branche s subject to arrest for deviancy.  
In March, the government appealed  a High Court ruling that struck down a 1986 
directive forbidding non-Muslims from using the word “Allah” and other Islamic 
words. 
In September, the government announced  it was dr afting a new law to restrict 
the propagation of non-Islamic religions in the Federal Territories .  
Criminal Justice  
Malaysia permits the death penalty for various crimes and makes the sentence mandatory for 11 offenses. 
Malaysia detains individuals without trial under restrictive laws. The Security Of-
fenses (Special Measures) Act, or SOSMA, allows for preventive detention of up 
to 28 days with no judicial review for a broadly defined range of “security of-fenses.” On September 1, the 
home minister stated  that individuals “issuing 
statements that could incite others to the point of causing public fear” could face action under SOSMA.  
Both the 1959 Prevention of Crime Act and the 2015 Prevention of Terrorism Act 
give government-appointed boards  the authority to impose detention without 
trial for up to two years, renew able indefinitely, to order electronic monitoring, 
and to impose other significant restrictions on freedom of movement and associ-ation. No judicial review is permitted for these measures.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Discrimin ation against LGBT people remains per vasive in Malaysia. F ederal law 
punishes “carnal knowledge against the order of nature” with up to 20 years in prison and mandatory whipp ing. Numerous state Sharia laws prohibit both 
same-sex relations and non-normative gender expression, resulting in frequent arrests of transgender people. In February, the 
Federal Court ruled  that section 
435HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH28 of Selangor’s Shariah Criminal Offences Enactment, which criminalizes sexual 
intercourse “against the order of nature,” was in valid.  
Authorities have proposed a range of change s to Sharia regulations that, if 
passed, would negatively impact LG BT people. These include harsher sentencing 
for same-sex conduct and gender expression. In September, the Perlis state 
fatwa committee  announced that those in gender-nonconforming clothing were 
banned from entering mosques.  
In January, Islamic authorities arrested Nur Sajat, a cosmetics entrepreneur and 
social media personality, on charges of “insulting Islam” by dressing in clothing 
typically associated with women at a religious event. On February 23, after she failed to appear in court, the Sharia court issued an arrest warrant for her. On February 25, the Islamic authorities announced the deployment of at least 122 law enforcement 
officers “to find and arrest Nur. ” In October, Malaysia filed ex-
tradition requests  for Nur with Thailand and A ustralia. On October 18, Nur Sajat 
announced that she was in Australia , where she has been granted  asylum. 
Women’s Rights  
In September, the High Court ruled  children born overs eas to Mala ysian mothers 
and foreign fathers are automatically entitled  to Malaysian citizenship, overturn-
ing a discriminatory practice in which only children born abroad to Malaysian fa-thers were entitled to citizenship. The government 
appealed the decision . 
Female students have described being subjected to “period spot checks”  in 
some schools to prove that they are menstruating and can be excused from fast-ing. A student who reported on social media that her 
teacher made jokes about 
rape in class  was threat ened with expuls ion, harassed on social media, and in-
vestigated for “intentional insult with intent  to provoke a breach of the public 
peace.” 
Children’s Rights  
Malaysia c ontinues to permit child marriage u nder both civil and Isl amic law. 
Girls ages 16 and 17 can m arry with the perm ission of their state’s c hief minister. 
For Muslims, most state Islamic laws set a minimum age of 16 for girls and 18 for 
436WORLD REPORT 2022boys, but permit marriage s below those ages, with no apparent minimum, with 
the perm ission of a Sharia court. Wid espread school closu res due to Covid-19 
may have increased risks of child marriage, as research shows that leaving edu-cation is highly correlated with girls being married off. 
Children in Mala ysia were unable to attend in-person c lasses due to Covid-19 re-
strictions for most of the year. The government began a 
phased reopening  of 
school starting in October. The prolonged closure exacerbated existing inequali-
ties, as many underprivileged students did not have the tools to access online learning. 
Key International Actors  
Malaysia was one of the first count ries to call for the Association of  South east 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to pl ay a role in resolving the cr isis in My anmar, and 
strongly supported  the de cision to exc lude the Myanmar c ommander-in-c hief 
from the annual ASEAN su mmit in October. Ma laysia has al so been support ive of 
calls for equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. The country has been 
elected to  a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council for the 2022-2024 
term. 
437HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMaldives 
The Maldives government of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih took steps to end 
repressive  restrictions on the media and speec h in 2021, and  made some 
progress addressing protection needs of migrant workers. However, the govern-
ment failed to reform abu sive law s, including on freedom of assembly, and 
blocked a number of protests. 
The authorities also failed to ens ure justice in cases of  violence against women 
and girls, which rights groups criticized. 
Authorities have also done little to address thre ats posed by extremist Islamist 
groups that have targeted politic ians and activis ts. On May 6, 2 021, parliament 
speaker and former President Mohamed Nasheed, accused of being an apostate 
by his opponents, was targeted in a bomb attac k. Nasheed survived c ritical in-
juries from the explosion that also injure d bystanders and members of his secu-
rity detail. 
Lack of Accountability  
A government- appointed comm ission inves tigating deaths  and enforced disap-
pearances failed to make significant pr ogress in investigating violent attacks on 
activis ts and politic ians, including journ alist Ahmed  Rilwan who dis appeared in 
2014 and blogger Yamin Rasheed who was ki lled in 2017. The comm ission rec-
ommended that the police file charges against former Vice President Ahmed 
Adeeb for interfering in the investigation and protecting alleged perpetrators. 
However, as of November the police had not charged Adeeb. The authorities ap-peared to stall pro secutions in other cases investigat ed by the commission. 
In January 2021, the government established the Ombudsperson’s Office for 
Transitional Justice, tasked with conducting criminal investigations and prosecu-
tions for state-led atrocities from 1953 to  2018. As of October, there were no up-
dates regarding its investigations.  
438WORLD REPORT 2022Migrant Workers  
Roughly one-third of the population in the Maldives comprises foreign migrant 
workers, at least 60,000 of them undocu mented. The vast majority work in the 
construction and tourism industries. 
In August, Member of Parliament A hmed Riza was charged with hum an traffick-
ing for the purpose of labor exploitation. The case first came to light in July 2020 when workers on Bodufinolhu island, a tour ist resort, protested months of non-
payment.  
While the Maldives made progress on its anti-human trafficking efforts and was 
upgraded to Tier 2 on the US State Depar tment’s Trafficking in Persons report in 
2021, the government failed to implement adequate measures to identify and support trafficking victims or investigate and  prosecute perpetrators. A draft bill 
is pending in parliament to bring the existing Anti-Human Trafficking law in com-pliance with the United Nations Protocol to  Prevent, Suppress and Punish Traf-
ficking in Persons. 
Freedoms of Expression, Association, Assembly 
The Solih gov ernment has taken steps  to end repre ssive rest rictions on the 
media and speech. According to the Repor ters Without Borders’ World Press 
Freedom Index, Maldives rose to a ranking of 72 in 2021 from 120 in 2018.   
However, the government  has not effectively con fronted thr eats by Is lamist 
groups targeting activists and civi l society or ganizations. In August 2021 a social 
media campaign targeted the local chapter of Transparency International, Trans-
parency Maldives, calling for it to be banned and accusing the government of 
colluding with civil society  to “make the Maldivi an education system secular.” 
This followed an annou ncement by Ministry of Education that it was part nering 
with Transparency Maldives.  
Covid-19  
The Maldives experienced a surge in Covid-19 cases in 2021. About 18 percent of 
the confirmed cases were among migrant workers, who also had to cope with economic hardship due to non-payment of wages.  
439HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe government provided vaccinations free of charge to everyone residing in the 
Maldives, including migrant workers, including those without documentation.  
Despite the findings by an expert committee pointing to unhealthy conditions 
and overcrowding in prisons, the government did not enforce its recommenda-
tions to improve hygiene. In Septem ber, Maafushi Prison was br ought under a 
state of emergency after a corrections officer c ontracted Covid-19, leading to fear 
of an outbreak.   
Environmental Harm  
Although it acknowledged increa sed threats from clim ate change, the Solih gov-
ernment failed to adequately enforce environmental protection laws and 
launched reclamation projects that risked environmental harm, something the ruling party had criticized while in oppo sition. In September, the citizen-led envi-
ronmental gr oup Save Maldives sought a civil injunction to stop the govern-
ment’s development project in Gulhifalhu lagoon, arguing that it would destroy environmentally  protected areas in vi olation of Mald ivian law.  
The government has yet to fulfill its pledge to restore the En vironmental Protec-
tion Agency as an independent entity. Environmental impact assessments for new projects often lack genuine consult ations with communities and proposed 
mitigation measures are rarely implemented.  
Torture and Ill-Treatment  
The Human Rights Comm ission of the Maldives (HRCM) launched an investiga-
tion into claims that a suspect  arrested on terrorism al legations was tortured in 
prison. The police admitted that they had used pepper spray on him.  
While hundreds of complaints of tortur e and ill-treatment have been filed with 
government comm issions since the Anti-Tor ture Act was pas sed in 2013, none 
have led to the prosecution of officials or redress for victims.  
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
A March 2021 UN report analyzing reporting of gender-based violence in 2020 found that confinement in the home with abusers, financial insecurity, and other 
440WORLD REPORT 2022problems exacerbated by lockdown restrictions contributed to an escalation of 
reported cases of abuse. In April, protest s broke out across Malé, the capital, in 
response to an increase in reported incidents of  sexual assault and domestic vi-
olence. 
In February, Gender Minister Aishath Moh amed Didi and four women parliamen-
tarians j oined civil society groups  in condemning the authorities f or allowing the 
former tourism minister, Ali Waheed, to travel to the United Kingdom despite the fact that  he was on trial at the time for multiple charges of sexual ass ault against 
ministry employee s. Waheed was arrested and is curr ently det ained in the UK.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
The Maldivian penal code criminalizes adu lt, consensual same-sex sexual con-
duct; punishment can include imprisonment of up to eight years and 100 lashes, and applies equally to men and w omen. Same-sex marriage is outlawed and 
punishable by up to a year in prison. Extremist groups in the Maldives use social media to ha rass and threa ten those who promot e the rights of l esbian, gay, bi-
sexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. 
Key International Actors  
United States  Ambassador to Maldive s Alaina Teplitz  made an officia l visit in Jan-
uary 2021; in the same month the US and Maldives held their first ever meeting on defense and security cooperation. In June, US Under Secretary of Defense Pol-icy Colin Kahl spoke by phone with Mald ivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid 
about furthering security cooperation and countering the threat of violent ex-tremism.  
In a phone call with Chinese President Xi  Jinping in June, President Solih commit-
ted to continuing cooperation on development projects. China agreed to a Covid-19 related postponement of loan repayments; the Maldives is significantly in debt to China. 
In August, India signed a contract to build a series of bridges linking Malé with 
neighboring islands. The $500 million Greater Malé Connectivity Project is de-
scribed as the “largest-ever” infrast ructure project in the Maldives. 
441HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn July, the Mald ives was taken off the “Human Rights Priority Count ries” list 
compiled by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the United Kingdom. 
In September, the Maldives endorsed the int ergovernmental Safe Schools Decla-
ration. 
442WORLD REPORT 2022Mali 
Human rights and security deteriorated in Mali in 2021 as abuses by armed Is-
lamist gr oups spiked, a political  crisis deepened, and impu nity for past  and on-
going atrocities by all armed groups persi sted. Mali’s trans ition to civili an rule 
following the 2020 military coup suffered a setback after another coup in May, the third in under 10 years.  
Armed Islami st attacks on civi lians and gov ernment forces int ensified, while the 
Malian security forces summarily ex ecuted numerous suspects. The number of 
internally displaced people increased significantly, bringing the 
total  to over 
385,000.   
The authorities made scant progress addre ssing rampant banditry or restoring 
state authority and services, including the judiciary, in the north and center, un-dermining the rule of law and confidence in the state. They made some progress delivering justice in terrorism cases, but not for large-scale atrocities implicating 
ethnic militias and soldiers during counterterrorism operations.  
Political Crisis    
On May 24, the vice-president, Col. Assimi Goïta, detained transitional President 
Bah N’Daw, Prime Minister Moctar Ouane, and other members of a transitional government installed after the August 20 20 military coup. After stripping them of 
their powers, Goït a was sw orn in as head of st ate in June.  
Goïta initially  promised to ab ide by the 18-month transition to civili an rule and 
organize free and fair parliamentar y and presidential elections by February 
2022, as agreed after the 2020 coup, but later announced the timeline could not be met. At writing several key electoral deadlines had not been met, including updating voter rolls and a planned October 31 constitutional referendum.   
Abuses by Islamist Armed Groups  
Islamist armed groups allied to Al-Qaed a or the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Greater 
Sahara kil led scores of  civili ans, as we ll as at least 19 United Nations  peacekeep-
ers and over 120 government security force members.  
443HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn August 8, armed Islamists massacred around  50 ethnic Songhai during an at-
tack on several villages in Gao region. On June 3, they killed 11 ethnic Tuaregs 
near Menaka. At  least 33 civilians we re killed by improvi sed explosive  devices 
planted on roadways, including 16 people on May 22 in Gao region. On Decem-
ber 3, they killed at least 31 traders after firing on a bus bringing them to the Bandiagara market in Mopti region. 
The number of civilians abducted or k idnapped by armed Is lamists inc reased 
significantly  during 2021, with those abducted including local officials, village 
and religious leaders, aid workers, and Chinese c onstruction workers. French 
journalist Oliver Dubois  was taken hostage near Gao. A Swiss missionary  and at 
least one Malian aid worker were exec uted while in the custody of armed Is-
lamists.     
In areas u nder their control, Is lamist armed groups  imposed zakat (forced taxa-
tion), beat civilians re fusing to adhere to their strict beh avioral and dress code, 
and implemented Sharia (Islamic law) via cour ts that did not adhere to fair trial 
standards. They also contributed to f ood insecurity by attacking farmers and be-
sieging villages. In May, Islamist armed gr oups amputated the arms and legs of 
three men accused of b anditry in Gao region.  
Abuses by State Security Forces  
Malian security  forces were implic ated in over 40 unlawful killing s of suspects 
and civi lians, and at least 20 enforced disappear ances from Dec ember 2020 to 
October 2021. Most killings took place during counterterrorism operations in the Mopti and Ségou regions and targeted ethnic Peuhl.  
In January, soldiers unlawfully killed eight people and dis appeared two others 
near Mali’s border with Burkina Faso. On March 23, soldiers in 
Boni  beat dozens 
of bus passengers after finding suspicious material in the baggage compart-
ment. The bodies of at least 13 of the passengers are believed to be buried in a common grave. At  least seven other men were unlawfully killed  by so ldiers from 
the Boni military camp in March and April. Several men were allegedly killed or subjected to enforced disappearance after their arrest by soldiers in Sofara and 
N’Dola villages in October. 
444WORLD REPORT 2022The detention, in Bamako, of former government  officials and others by the mili-
tary government raised due proce ss concerns. Five men, including a former 
prime minister and journalist, were detained  in December 2020 for allegedly 
plotting a coup against the Malian transitional  government. They were released 
in April for lack of evidence.  
Following the May coup, the deposed interim president and prime minister were 
unlawfully detained u nder house arrest for three months. In July, a man accused 
of attempting to stab interim President Goïta died in custody under suspicious circumstances. At least three high-level government officials arrested in Bamako by the security forces in September and October were held incommunicado for several weeks and tortured in unauthorized detention facilities.  
Violations of Children’s Rights  
The United Nations reported that at least 60 children were killed and 71 were maimed by armed groups in 2021. Armed gr oups also recruited and used over 
200 children as child soldiers. As of June 2021, insecurity forced the closure of 1,595 schools, leaving more than 47 8,000 children out of school. 
Women and Girls Rights  
An estimated 91 percent  of Malian women and girls continued to undergo female 
genital mutilation and numerous women were subjected to sexual abuse by dif-
ferent armed groups. During 2021, seven officials with Mali’s Basketball Federa-tion were fired or suspended , and the head  coach was indicted, for their 
involvement in the 
sexual abuse  of teenage players with Mali’s national youth 
team.   
Communal Violence  
Dogon and Bambara mi litias incr easingly target ed members of  their own com-
munities, apparently for their failure to provide recruits and support their mili-
tary objectives. In central Mali, militias k idnapped doz ens of civilians for whom 
they demanded considerable ransoms. These groups killed several hostages and others, including people they had detained at unauthorized checkpoints in cen-
tral Mali.  
445HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAccountability for Abuses  
Hundreds of detainees were held in ex tended detention awaiting court trials. The 
Specialized Judicial Unit against Terrorism  and Transnational Organized Crime 
(SJU), whose mandat e was exp anded in 2019 to  include human rights violations, 
made progress investigating terr orism and a few atrocity cases. At least 14 terror-
ism-related trials, inc luding for 2015 attacks on a night club and two hotels 
which killed 37 people, were adjudicated in late 2020 and 2021.    
The transitional government pursued a few other cases involving human rights 
abuses that involve high-profile suspects. In July, Moussa Diawara, a former in-
telligence chief, was arrested and char ged with invo lvement in the 2016 tor ture 
and disappearance of journalist Birama Touré. In connection with the same case, Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for 
Karim Keita , the former presi-
dent’s son, who fled to Côte d’Ivoire after the 2020 coup.   
In August, a former defense minister and a former finance minister were arrested 
on corruption charges linked to the 2014 fraudulent purchase of a presidential plane. In September, the judiciary indicted and 
detained the commander of an 
elite police  unit in connection w ith exce ssive u se of lethal  force which left sev-
eral proteste rs dead  in 2020.   
The minister of defense signed 10 pro secution orders against alleged perpetra-
tors of four atrocity cases involving soldiers in 2018 and 2020. At year’s end, tri-als had yet to be held. 
On March 15, a Bamako court 
dropped charges  against 16 soldiers, including for-
mer coup leader Amadou Sanogo for the 2012 killing of 21 elite soldiers. The court cited the 2019 Law of National Understanding which grants amnesty for some domestic offenses but not for international crimes.   
Justice for communal vi olence was hindered by the r eluctance of mem bers of the 
security forces to help gendarmes arrest suspects. Only a few cases of commu-
nal violence were tried by the Mopti High Court, including, in June, a trial which led to the conviction, in absentia, of 
12 Dogon men  for the 2019 killing of 37 
Peuhl villagers in Koulogon.  
The report  of the Intern ational Commiss ion of Inquiry, estab lished under the 
2015 peace accord to investigat e serious violations between 2012 and January 
446WORLD REPORT 20222018, was presented to the United  Nations Secu rity Council in December 2020. 
The report documented evidence of war crimes by Malian  security forces and 
crimes against humanity by armed Is lamists and ethnic militias.  
Public he arings by the T ruth, Justice and Reconcili ation Comm ission, estab lished 
in 2014 to investigate crimes and root ca uses of violence since 1960, continued 
in 2021. Over 22,500 people have provided tes timony to the Commiss ion. 
Key International Actors  
In the wake of the May coup, the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) and the African Union suspended  Mali from their decis ion-making 
bodies. In October, Mali’s transitional government expelled  the ECOWAS special 
representative and, in November, ECOWAS i mposed sanctions , including travel 
bans and asset freezes, on member s of the transitional government.  
 Aid from the United States remains suspended pending free and fair elections.   Operation Barkhane, the 5,100-member French counterterrorism force, con-
ducted numerous operations, but in June, France announced a 
significant reduc-
tion, notably a halving of personnel and the closure of military bases in northern 
Mali by early 2022.   
A French airstrike on January 3 in centra l Mali killed at least 22 people. A United 
Nations investigation  concluded that  the majority of  those killed were civi lians 
attending a wedding. French authoritie s rejected the findings, insisting that the 
victims were armed Islamist fighters and  characterized the UN investigation as 
“biased .”   
The European Union Training M ission in Mali (EUTM) and the EU Capacity Build-
ing Miss ion (EUCAP) continued to train and advise M ali’s secu rity forces. In Janu-
ary 2021, EUCAP’s mandate was adjusted to  include the restoration of 
government presence in central Mali. Task Force Takuba, comprised of 600 Euro-pean special forces, engaged in military operations throughout 2021.  
In May, June, and September, the EU condemned the coup and urged the govern-
ment to organize elections by February 2022. At the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), the EU also stressed the importance of fighting impunity for abuses com-mitted by terrorist groups, armed mi litias, and Mali’s security forces. 
447HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn June, the UN Security Council renewed for one year  the mandate of the UN 
Multidimensional  Integrated Stabilization M ission in Mali (MINUSMA) and ex-
panded it to support Mali’s re turn to democratic  rule. During a visit by the UNSC 
in October, members pressured the government to promptly restore democratic rule. 
In March, the HRC 
renewed  the mandate of the UN independent expert on Mali 
for another year. During a visit to M ali in August, the expert,  Alioune Tine, noted 
that the secu rity situation had det eriorated to the ex tent that  the “very survival 
of the state” is threatened. In August, the Security Council renewed for one year 
the Mali Sanctions Committee Panel of Experts.  
The International Criminal Court trial continued against a former leader of the Is-
lamist armed group Ansar Dine on charges of war crimes and crimes against hu-
manity, including rape and sexual slavery committed in 2012-2013.  
448WORLD REPORT 2022Mexico 
Human rights violations—including torture, enforced disappearances, abuses 
against migrants, extrajudicial killings, gender -based violence, and attacks on 
independent journalists and human rights defenders—have continued under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office in December 2018. Im-punity remains the norm. Legal reforms enacted in 2017 and 2018 have been slow and ineffective in addressing torture and impunity.  
President L ópez Obrador has greatly  expanded the scope of  the armed forces’ 
activities, deploying them for law enforcement and customs enforcement, and to 
control irregular immigration, run social programs, and build and operate mega projects. 
The National Se arch Commiss ion (CNB) has increased tran sparency about the 
number of “disappeared” persons, but prosec utors make little effort to investi-
gate disappearances or identify those responsible. 
In November 2019, the Senate named Rosario Piedra Ibarra to head the National 
Human Rights Comm ission (CNDH). Many human rights defenders ca lled her ap-
pointment unconstitutional, saying that, as a former senior member of the presi-dent’s party, she is too close to  the administration to be autonomous and 
apolitical.   
In August 2021, President López Obrador held a referendum on whether “past 
political actors” since 1 988 should be tried f or “crimes” including electoral 
fraud, corruption, and loss of lives to neo liberalism. Low turnout  invalidated the 
results.  
The president has coll aborated w ith the US in a busive anti-immigration polic ies, 
including illegal expulsion of migr ants and asylum seekers by plane and bus to 
Central America.  
Criminal Justice System  
The criminal justice system routinely fails to provide justice to victims of violent crimes and human rights violations. Only 5.2 percent of crimes committed in Mexico are solved, the nongovernmental gr oup México Evalúa reports. Causes of 
449HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHfailure include corruption, inadequate training and  resources, and complicity of 
prosecutors and public defenders with crimin als and other abu sive officia ls.  
The justice system regularly fails to ensure due process f or those accused of 
crimes. Police and prosecut ors commonly use torture to obtain confessions. Pre-
trial detention is mandatory for many  offenses, violating international human 
rights standards. Prisons are notoriously un sanitary and overcrowded. Prosecu-
tors continue to use arraigo detention, a mechanism allowing them to obtain ju-dicial authorization to detain anyone for up to 40 days without charge, for interrogation.  
The attorney general never properly imp lemented a 2018 reform intended to 
make the office more independent from the government and more accountable to victims and their families, human rights and rule-of-law groups report. In 
2021, Congress repe aled many of  the human rights pro visions of the 2018 re-
form. 
In April 2021, pro-government legislators passed a law extending the terms of 
the Supreme Court Chief Justice and members of the Federal Judiciary Council, which controls hiring and firing of judges. The chief justice declined the exten-
sion, and opposition legislators have challenged the law before the Supreme 
Court.  
Military Abuses and Extrajudicial Killings 
Mexico has r elied heavil y on the military to control  drugs and fight  organized 
crime, leading to widespread human rights violations. From 2013 through 2020, the CNDH received 3,799 complaints of military abuses.  
President L ópez Obrador has vastly exp anded the scope of the military in public 
security, often su pplanting civilian la w enforcement. In 2019,  he created the Na-
tional Guard to replace the Federal Police as the government’s principal law en-forcement body. The National Guard is led by military officers, trained by the military, and composed largely of military troops. In May 2020, the president for-mally deployed the militar y to assist the National Guard in civi lian law enforce-
ment. The military can now leg ally det ain civi lians, take charge of crime scenes, 
and preserve evidence. Under past governments, charging the military with these tasks has contributed to  serious co ver-ups of h uman rights abus es. In July 
450WORLD REPORT 20222021, the president proposed formally  placing the National Guard under military 
control. 
In 2014, Congress reformed the Code of Mi litary Justice, requiring abuses by 
members of the mi litary against civilians to  be prosecuted in civili an, not mili-
tary, courts. However, pursuit of justice re mains elu sive.  
In July 2020 , 12 civilians we re killed in a shootout with soldiers in Tamaulipas 
state. A video leaked to the press in August showed a soldier giving the order to kill a civilian. In September, the Sec retary of Def ense announced that only mili-
tary police—no civili an prosecutors—were investig ating. In March 2021, a lawyer 
for the families of victims told Reuter s that no soldiers had yet been detained, 
despite the video evidence.  
In September 2021, the Defense Ministry admitted that at least 47 people had 
been killed in “collateral damage” by the armed forces during the López Obrador presidency, according to information obtained through transparency requests by Mexican journali sts. The Defense Mini stry has paid  compensation to families but 
has not s anctioned any soldier s or reported the cases to police or prosecutors 
for criminal investigation. 
Torture  
Torture is widely practiced to obtain confessions and extract information. It is most frequently applied after victims are detained, often arbitr arily, but before 
they are handed  to civi lian prosecutors. Victims are often held inc ommunicado 
at military bases or illegal detention sites. A 2017 law made it illegal to use con-
fessions obtained through torture as evidence at criminal trials. However, au-thorities often fail to investigate allegations of torture.  
In 2016—the last year for which data is availa ble—Mexico’s national statistics of-
fice surveyed more than 64,000 people inc arcerated in 338 prisons. Almost two-
thirds (64 percent) reported physical violence at the time of arrest, including electric shocks, choking, and smothering.  
451HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHDisappearances  
Thousands of people disappear every year in Mexico. Police, the military, and 
criminal groups are responsible for many disappearances.  
Prosecutors and police ra rely attempt to find the disappeared or identify those 
responsible. Families of the disappeared have formed more than 130 “search 
collectives” to investigate dis appearances, including, frequently, by digging up 
mass graves.  
In 2019,  a well-respect ed human rights  defender was appointed to he ad the gov-
ernment’s National  Search Commiss ion (CNB). The CNB search es mass graves 
across the country. It has al so taken steps to determine and publish  the true 
number of people disappeared, gathering information from authorities and cre-
ating an online platform to report disappearances anonymously and show real-time numbers of those disappeared , excluding personally identifying 
information.  
As of September 2021, the platform had recorded over 90,000 people disap-
peared, mostly since 2006. Authorities have publicly acknowledged the real 
number is likely higher. The majority are between 15 and 30 years old, from lower income families, the CNB reports. More than 23,000 are listed as having disap-
peared since President López Obrador took office in December 2018.  
From 2006 to 2020, at least 50,000 bodie s passed through the custody of state 
and local forensic medical services without being properly identified. Most are now buried in mass graves. Fr om 2006 to 2021, authorities reported having 
found at leas t 4,000 mass graves. 
In August 2021, the government named a group of seven international forensic 
and legal experts to lead the Extraordinary Forensic Identification Mechanism, which will be tasked with identifying bodies recovere d from mass graves.  
In November, the UN Committee on Enforced Dis appearances visited Me xico—its 
first visit to any country. The committee first requ ested permission to visit Mexico 
in 2013 but was denied acce ss by the prev ious government. In August 20 20, the 
López Obrador government recognized the committee’s jurisdiction to consider cases from Mexico, allow ing families of victims to submit cases to the committee 
once they have exhausted their legal options domestically.  
452WORLD REPORT 2022Attacks on Journalists a nd Human Rights Defenders  
Journalists and human rights defenders—particularly those who criticize public 
officials or expose the work of crimin al cartels—often face  attacks, harass ment, 
and surveillance by government authorities and criminal groups.  
Mexico is one of the most dangerous coun tries in the world for journalists, on 
par with war zones like Syri a and Afghanistan in number of journalists killed, ac-
cording to the Committee to Protect Journ alists and Reporters Without Borders. 
In 2020, journalists registered 692 threats, attacks, or other forms of aggres-sion—reportedly the highest year on record. Article 19 reported five journalists killed in relation to their work from January to September 2021.   
Authorities routinely fail to investigate crimes against journalists adequately, 
often preemptively ruling out their profession as a motive. Since its creation in 
2010 through August 2021, the federal Special Prosecutor’s Office to investigate 
crimes against journali sts has opened more than 3,362 inv estigations, brought 
265 charges for crimes, and obtained 25  convictions. In the face of uninvesti-
gated violence, many journalists self-censor.  
Mexico is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world for human rights 
defenders. From January through Sept ember 2021, the Mexico Office of the UN 
High Comm issioner for Human Rights r eported 10 human rights  defenders killed. 
As with journalists, violence against human rights defenders is rarely investi-
gated or prosecuted.  
In 2012, the federal government establi shed the Protection Mechanism for 
Human Rights Defenders and Journalis ts, which provides bodyguards, armored 
cars, and panic buttons, and helps jour nalists temporarily relocate in response 
to serious threats. A 2019 study by the Office of the United Nations High Com-missioner for Human Rights documented the Mechanism’s problems in coordi-
nating protective measures, providing resources, and establishing clear 
procedures. Six journalists have been killed under the program’s protection, four 
since President López Obrador took office. In October 2020, the government eliminated the independent fund that paid  for protection meas ures, putting the 
mechanism in a precarious financial situation. 
453HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH454WORLD REPORT 2022
“Like I’m Drowning” 
Children and Families Sent to Harm by the US ‘Remain in Mexico’ ProgramHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Mexican laws do not adequately prot ect women and girls, including those with 
disabilities, against gender-based  and sexual violence. Some p rovis ions, includ-
ing those that peg the severity of punis hments for sexual offenses to the 
“chastity” of the victim, contradict international standards. 
Abortion access varies by state. All 32 sta tes allow abortion in cases of rape. Six 
allow it for any reason up to 12 wee ks of pregnancy. Women and pregnant people 
face many barriers when trying to access abortion, even when it is legal. Doctors and nurses regularly attempt to dissuade them from undergoing the procedure 
or refuse to perform it. 
In September, the Supreme Court made three rulings that set important prece-
dents for reproductive rights. The court fo und that absolute criminalization of 
abortion is unconstitutional and that women should not be criminally prose-cuted for undergoing the procedu re. It ruled that state governments do not have 
the authority to legislate that life begins at conception. And it ruled that medical staff’s right to conscientiously object to performing abortions is subject to lim-its.  
Women and girls continue to face alarming rates of gender-based violence. In 
2020, the government reported nearly 1,000 femicides—killings of women be-
cause of their gender. Women’s rights groups  say femicide is likely under-re-
ported. 
Migrants and Asylum Seekers  
Criminal cartels, common criminals, and sometimes police and migration offi-cials regularly target people migrating through Mexico to rob, kidnap, extort, 
rape, or kill them. These crimes are rarely r eported, investigated, or punished.  
The López Obr ador administration has actively par ticipated in abu sive US immi-
gration policies. It failed to provide po lice protection or access to justice, work, 
health care, and education for the over 71,000 asylum seekers, including many families with children, sent to Mexi co under the “Remain in Mexico” policy. 
Many suffered abuses from criminal cartels or Mexican authorities. President López Obrador said the program had produced “very good results.” 
455HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe López Obr ador administration has been illegal ly expelling thousands of asy-
lum seekers to Guatemala without due process, including many who were first expelled from the US into the custody  of Mexican authorities.     
In 2019, President López Obrador deployed the National Guard for migration en-
forcement. The government says soldiers only support migration officials. How-
ever, in a leaked audio recording from 2019, a senior migration official told her team they were now “under the inst ruction and super vision of the National 
Guard.” In September 2021, National Guard troops and Mexican immigration agents violently detained a series of caravans of asylum seekers in Chiapas state, leaving many injured.  
Mexican immigration officials have refused  to follow court rulings ordering them 
to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in immigration detention centers. Detained mi-grants have said they were not given masks or soap and were denied medical treatment when they had symptoms of Covid-19. 
Mexico’s asylum system is severely overstretched. Since 2013, the number of ap-
plications rece ived has ne arly doubled  every year. Officials expect to receive 
more than 100,000 applications in 2021. From January through August 2021, Mexico received nearly 78,000 asylum applications but resolved just over 23,000.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Twenty-four of 32 states have legaliz ed same-sex marri age. Elsewhere, same-sex 
couples must petition for an injunction (amparo) to be allowed to marry. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that a lesbian couple from Aguascalientes state should 
be allowed to register a child born to one of the women as a child of both. The ruling was based on the best interest of  the child and the principles of equality 
and non-discrimination. 
Seventeen states have passed laws creating a procedure permitting transgender 
people to change their names and gender markers on birth certificates through a simple administrative process. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a 
transgender person from Veracruz who contended that in refusing to change their name and gender marker on their birth certificate, the municipal Civil Reg-
456WORLD REPORT 2022istry had violated their rights. In 2019, the Supreme Court issued a similar ruling 
arising from a case in Jalisco. 
Disability Rights  
Under the López Obrador administration, serious gaps remain in protecting the rights of people with disabilities. They lack access to justice, education, legal standing, legal capacity, protection from domestic violence, and informed con-
sent in health de cisions. In 20 19, Human Rights Watch document ed cases of 
state-run hospitals and private individuals who shackled people with disabili-ties. They lack access to buildings, transportation, and public spaces. Women with disabilities suffer di sproportionate violence. 
The only policy  to assist people with disa bilities is a non-contrib utive disability 
pension that reaches only 933,000 people of the 6,179,890 who live in the coun-try. Its distribution is opaque and discretionary. 
In many states, people with disabilities have no choice but to depend on their 
families for assistanc e or to l ive in institutions, which is inconsistent  with their 
right to live independently and be included in the community under the Conven-tion on the Rights of Persons with Disabi lities. People with disabilities receive 
little government protection or support and are at higher risk of abuse and neg-
lect by their families. 
In October 2021, following a C RPD committee recommendation, the government 
publicly apologized to a man with intellect ual and psychosocial disabilities who 
had been imprisoned for fo ur years although there was no evidence he had com-
mitted a crime and a judge had found him unfit to stand trial, leaving him with-out the opportunity to defend himself. 
Since President López Obrador took office, the National Council on People with 
Disabilities, the principal government body  coordinating efforts to implement 
disability rights, has been effectively non-operational.  
Covid-19  
The López Obr ador administration has failed to ta ke many of the basic steps rec-
ommended by global health authorities to limit the spread of Covid-19. The offi-
457HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcial leading Mexic o’s response has called lar ge-scale testing “usele ss” and “a 
waste of time,” despite the World Health Organization’s insistence on the impor-tance of testing. As  a result, Mexi co has one of the lowest rates  of Cov id-19 test-
ing—and highest rates of positive test  results—in the world. Officials and experts 
agree that the real number of Covid-19 infections and deaths is likely many times higher than the official count. 
As of September 2021, 30 percent of Mexi cans had been fully vaccinated against 
Covid-19 and 47 percent had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Mexico has m ade the vaccine eligible by regions and age groups, from o lder to younger 
people. Proof of address is required to receive the vaccine. Anyone over the age 
of 18 was eligible to rece ive at least the first dose of the vaccine by Septem ber.  
Schools were closed in Mexico from March 2020 to August 2021, and classes 
were broadcast on television and radio . Although 94 percent of Mexican house-
holds have television, a lack of afforda ble internet access left many children, es-
pecially those in low-income households or with disabilities, unable to fully 
participate in education. Many teac hers protested the re-opening, at the height 
of the third wave of reported Covid-19 deaths.  
Climate Policy and Impacts 
As one of the world’s top 15 emitters of greenhouse gases, Mexico is contribut-
ing to the climate cr isis that is tak ing a growing toll on hum an rights arou nd the 
globe. 
López Obr ador has openly  opposed w ind and so lar energy production. He has 
promised to resc ue Mexico’s coal and  oil industries and has introduced reforms 
that favor state-owned fossil-fuel pow er plants over renewable energy sources. 
He has vowed to amend the cons titution to overc ome legal ch allenges to these 
policies. 
López Obrador’s initiative “Sowing Lif e,” which he touts as a major component 
of his strategy to cut greenhouse gas emiss ions, may have caused 72,000 
hectares of forest loss, with inadequate monitoring enabling beneficiaries to clear forests and then be paid by the government to plant trees. (López Obrador 
falsely claimed  in November 2021 that a deal to end forest loss by 2030 reached 
at the global climate su mmit in Glasgo w was inspired by “So wing Life”.) Law en-
458WORLD REPORT 2022forcement actions to curb illegal deforestation drastically diminished in recent 
years. 
In its December 2020 climate action plan, Mexico increased the baseline against 
which its em issions r eductions are calculat ed but m aintained its  2015 em issions  
reduction commitments. Th is will allow Mexico to inc rease its em issions while 
technically meeting its targets. The plan is “insufficient” to meet the Paris Agree-ment goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, according to the Climate Action Tracker. If all countries’ commitments  were in a similar range, warming would 
reach up to 3°C by the end of the century. 
Climate change is expected to increase the severity of extreme weather events, 
requiring steps by the government to protect at-risk populations from their fore-seeable harms, including food insecurity due to rising temperatures and droughts impacting crops. In August 2021, hurricanes Grace and Nora caused flooding, landslides, and power outages in mu ltiple states, killing at least nine 
people. 
Key International Actors and Foreign Policy  
Mexico’s foreign policy regarding human rights under the López Obrador admin-istration has been based on the principle of  “non-intervention.” In June, Mexico 
criticized other countries in the region that had condemned the jailing of critics and opposition candidates in Nicaragua, saying that they were intervening in Nicaragua’s internal affairs.  
In June 2020 , Mexico was elected as a non-permanent mem ber of the UN Secu-
rity Council for 2021 to 2022. Mexico highlighted that one of its priorities on the council would be the protection of chi ldren. Mexico endorsed the Safe Schools 
Declaration in May 2021.  
In October 2020 , Mexico was re-elected to the UN H uman Rights Co uncil. 
In 2020, Mexico appointed itself as one of 23 “Champion countries” of the 
Global Compact for Safe, Or derly and Regular Migration. 
In August and September 2021, Mexico  hosted negotiations between represen-
tatives from the Venezuelan government and opposition groups mediated by 
Norway. 
459HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMexico endorsed the World Health Organiz ation’s Solidarity Call to Action for the 
Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, an initiative to “realize equitable global ac-cess to COVID-19 health technologies through pooling of knowledge, intellectual 
property and data.” 
460WORLD REPORT 2022Morocco and Western Sahara 
Morocco cracked down on journalists and critics, including via apparently politi-
cally motivated prosecutions for criminal offenses. Laws restricting individual freedoms remained in effect, including laws  that discriminate against women 
and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. In Western Sahara, authorities continued to severely constr ain activities and speech of independ-
ence act ivists. 
Criminal Justice System 
The Code of Penal Procedure gives a defendant the right to contact a lawyer after 
24 hours in police custody, extendable to 36 hours. But detainees do not have 
the right to have a lawyer present when police interrogate or present them with 
their statements for signature. In recent years, police agents often coerced or 
tricked detainees into signing self-inc riminating statements, which judges later 
relied on to convict even when the defend ants repudiated those statements in 
court.  
Freedom of Association and Assembly 
Authorities continued to impede the work of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), the country’s largest independent human rights group. The AMDH said that, as of September 15, 2021, authorities had declined to process the administrative formalities for 84 of the 99  AMDH local branches, im-
peding the ability of these branches to carry out basic functions like opening 
new bank accounts or renting space. These obstructions persisted even when administrative courts ruled in favor of the AMDH. 
Freedom of Expression  
On July 30, several global media  reported that Pegasus, a potent spyware devel-
oped by Israeli firm NSO Group, might have been used to infiltrate the smart-phones of many individuals in Morocco . Pegasus, which NSO Group claims is 
exclusively sold to governments, is 
capable of  accessing contact lists, reading 
emails and text messages, tracking ca lls, collecting passwords, mobile phone 
461HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtracking, and hijacking the target device’s microphone and video camera to turn 
it into a surveill ance device. Journ alists and Moroccan human rights activists 
and journalists were among the targets. 
Morocco’s penal code punishes with prison and fines nonvi olent speech of-
fenses, including “causing harm” to Is lam or the monarchy, and “inciting 
against” Morocco’s “t erritorial integrity,” a reference to its claim to Western Sa-
hara. While the Press and Publication Code does not provide prison as a punish-ment, journalists and people who speak out on social media have been prosecuted under the penal code f or their critical, nonviolent speech.  
Those included Moroccan-Americ an YouTube commentator 
Chafik Omerani  and 
protester Noureddine Aouaj , sentenced to three months and two years in prison, 
respectively, for “defaming constitutional institutions” after they criticized King 
Mohammed VI. Omerani was freed on May 6 after completing his term. YouTube 
commentator Mustapha Semlali , also known as Allal Al-Qadou s, was sentenced 
to two years for “undermining the monarchy” after he allegedly defamed Prince Moulay Rachid, the king’s brother; Moroccan-Italian student 
Ikram Nazih , was 
sentenced to three years for “harming the Islamic religion” after she shared a 
Facebook post deemed to be making light of  a Quranic ver se. She was freed on 
August 23 after an appeals court reduc ed her sentence to two months. YouTube 
commentator Jamila Saadane  was sentenced to three months  for “insulting or-
ganized institutions and distributing fal se allegations” after she claimed that au-
thorities protected sexual tour ism activities in Marrakech.  
In other cases, Morocco  has arrested,  prosecuted, and impri soned sev eral critic s 
not overtly for what they said but instead for offenses related to sex or embezzle-ment, where the evidence was either scant or dubious, or the trial involved clear 
fair-trial violations.  
On January 27 , a Rabat Court of First Instance sentenced historian and free 
speech advocate 
Maati Monjib  to one year in prison for “receiving funds from a 
foreign organization in order to undermine Mor occo’s internal security.” The 
basis for the charge was that a nongovernmental  organization (NGO) set up by 
Monjib to defend free speech received gr ants from European NGOs to organize 
trainings for local journalists in a way th at “harmed Morocco’s internal security.”  
462WORLD REPORT 2022The trial of Monjib took place on January 20 in his absence, even though he had 
been in the same tribunal that day to answer a prosecutor’s  questions in another 
case, for which he was in pretrial det ention. Monjib’s lawy ers say the court noti-
fied neither Monjib nor them about the trial, which the authorities denied. Mon-jib was relea sed on March 23, aft er hunger strik ing for 19 days. The case, in 
which three co-defend ants were sentenced to one year in ab sentia, was pending 
at time of writing appeal.  
On July 9, a court of first instance in Casablanca sentenced popular critical 
columnist 
Soulaiman Raissouni  to five years in prison for “indecent assault.” 
Raissouni was plac ed in pret rial detention on May  2020, days aft er a man ac-
cused him in a Facebook post of sexual ly assaulting him two years earlier, while 
he was visiting Raissouni’s  home. Raissouni s pent a year in pr etrial detention 
without the court ev er providing a sub stantive basis for denying him bail for 
such an extended period . He was denied acce ss to his own case file until late in 
the trial.  
Raissouni, who waged a long hunger strike to protest the conditions of his trial, 
requested to be transported to the courtroom in an ambulance and attend the sessions in a wheelc hair, under medical  supervis ion. The judge denied his re-
quest, and thus Raissouni did not attend the last four sessions of his own trial. His defense withdrew from the trial in pr otest. After the verdict, Raissouni 
stopped his hu nger strike, which had laste d 118 days. The ca se was pending ap-
peal at time of writing.  
Taoufik Bouachrine, the director of the now-defunct independent daily Akhbar al-
Yaoum , where Raissouni worked as editor-in-chief , is serv ing a 15 -year sentence 
for sexual assau lt on sever al women. The ver dict was h anded down by an ap-
peals court in 2019 after a trial that  the United Nation’s Working Group on Arbi-
trary Detention said was marred by due-proce ss viol ations and part of a “judicial 
harassment attributable to nothing other than [Bouachrine’s] inv estigative jour-
nalism.” 
On July 19, a court of first instance in Casablanca sentenced investigative jour-
nalist Omar Radi to six years in prison on multiple char ges, including espionage 
and rape of a female co-worker, and his colleague, journalist Imad Stitou, to one year in prison, with six months suspended, for “participation” in the alleged 
463HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHrape because he “failed to intervene to stop it.” Radi testified that the sex with 
the complain ant was c onsensual.  
Radi, an outspoken critic who has long been subject to st ate harass ment, has 
been in detention since his arrest on July 29, 2020. Stitou remained free pending appeal.  
Examining the facts in the case on which the espionage charges against Radi are 
based, Human Rights Watch found that they consist of nothing but standard journalistic work, corporate due-diligence st udies that Radi performed as a paid 
consultant, and his routine meetings w ith foreign diplomats. The case file, which 
Human Rights Watch reviewed, included no evidence that Radi had provided classified  information to any one or that he even had access to  such information. 
Several due process violations were recorded during the trial, which Human 
Rights Watch observed. The court never provided a substantive justification for holding Radi for one year in pr etrial detention. The court refused to hear a de-
fense witness, and admitted written statements  by prosecution witnesses but re-
fused to summon them, thus denying the defense’s right to cross-examine them. 
While Radi had to fight in court for months to get his case file, websites closely tied with security services obtained leaked copies even before the trial started, and based on those leaks, published scores of articles 
affirming  Radi’s guilt. The 
case was pending appeals at time of writing.   
Monjib, Raissouni, Radi, and others were subjected to relentless character as-
sassin ation efforts in scores  of articles publi shed in websites known local ly as 
“slander media ” because of their incessant and seemingly coordinated attacks 
against critics of the authorities. Known for their proximity to security services, 
these websites have published in past years thousands of articles including per-
sonal information on targeted indiv iduals. The information included banking and 
property records, screenshots of pr ivate electronic conversations, allegations 
about sexual relationships, and intimate biographical details. 
Western Sahara  
The United Nations-sponsored process of negotiations between Morocco and 
the Polisario Front, the liberation movement that seeks self-determination for Western Sahara, remained stalled after the resignation in May 2019 of Horst 
464WORLD REPORT 2022Kohler, the envoy of the UN secretary-general . Staffan De Mis tura was appointed 
as a new envoy on October 6.  
Most of Western Sahara has been under Moroccan control  since Spain, the terri-
tory’s former coloni al adminis trator, w ithdrew in 1975. In 19 91, both Morocco 
and the Polisario, the liberation movement for Western Sahara, agreed to a UN-
brokered ceasefire to prepare for a referendum on self-determination. That refer-
endum never took place. Morocco considers Western Sahara to be an integral part of the kingdom and rejects demands for a vote on self-determination that would include independence as an option. 
In November 2020, Moroccan security forces established a near-constant heavy 
presence outside the hou se of independenc e activist 
Sultana Khaya , in Bouj-
dour, Western Sahara. They have provided no justification and have prevented several people, including family  members, fr om vis iting. According to  Khaya, po-
lice forces raided her house several times, beating her and relatives, and smear-ing the house with a foul-smelling liquid. Khaya is locally known for her public displays of vehement opposition to Morocco’s control of Western Sahara. The ar-bitrary block ade of her house was still in place at time of writing. 
Moroccan authorities systematically prevent gatherings supporting Sahrawi self-
determination, obstruct the work of some local human rights NGOs, including by blocking their legal registration, and on occasion 
beat activists  and journalists in 
their custody and on the streets, or raid their houses and destroy or confiscate their belongings. Human Rights Watch docu mented some of these beatings and 
raids, including of  the house of independence act ivist 
Hassana Duihi  in May 
2021. 
In 2021, 19 Sahrawi men remained in prison after they were convicted in unfair 
trials in 2013 and 2017 for the killing of 11 security force members, during clashes that erupted after authorities forc ibly dismantled a large protest en-
campment in Gdeim Izik, Western Sahara, in 2010. Both courts relied almost en-tirely on their confessions to the police to convict them, without seriously investigating claims that the defendants had signed their confessions under tor-
ture. The Cassation court, Morocco’s highest judicial instance, upheld the ap-peals verdict on November 25, 2020. 
465HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen’s and Girls’ Rights  
The Family Code discriminates against women with regard to inheritance and 
procedures to obtain divorce. The code sets 18 as a minimum age of marriage but allows judges to grant “exemptions” to marry girls aged 15 to 18 at the re-quest of their family.  
While Morocco’s 2018 Violence against Women law 
criminalized  some forms of 
domestic violence, established prevention measures, and provided new protec-
tions for sur vivor s, it required  survivors to fi le for criminal  prosecution in order to 
obtain protection, which few can do. It also did not set out the duties of police, 
prosecutors, and inves tigative judges in domestic violence cases, or fund 
women’s shelters.  
Morocco’s law does not explicitly criminalize marital rape, and women who re-
port rape can find themselves prosecuted instead for engaging in sexual inter-
course outside marriage if authorities do not believe her.  
In July, an Instagram post showing  a hotel in Marrakech denying access to Mo-
roccan women unaccompanied by either their husb ands or families, went viral.  
Morocco bans hotels fr om accommodating unmarried couples in a shared room, 
but there is no known law denying access to unaccompanied women from any fa-
cility. 
In July, authorities appointed  the first female head prosecutor at a court of first 
instance. While Morocco does have female judges, women overall continue to 
remain heavily underrepresented in judicial positions.  
In May, Morocco’s National Human Rights Council reported  that sexual harass-
ment and gender-based violence are widespread against female staff and stu-dents at Moroccan universities, and a lack of mechanisms and means to adequately deal  with harass ment, and provide assistanc e to victims in universi-
ties. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Consensual sex between adults  who are not married to one another is punish-
able by up to one year in prison. Moroccan law also criminalizes what it refers to 
466WORLD REPORT 2022as acts of “sexual deviancy” between member s of the same sex, a term that au-
thorities use to refer to homosexuality mor e generally, and punishes them with 
prison terms of up to three years. 
In a memorandum published in October 2019, the National Human Rights Coun-
cil, a state-appointed body, recommended decriminalizing  consensual sex be-
tween non-married adults. More than 25 NGOs expressed support for the recommendation. The Moroccan government 
did not act upon it .   
Refugees and Asylum Seekers 
The government has yet to approve a draft of  Morocco’s first law on the right to 
asylum, introduced in 2013. A 2003 migration law  remained in effect, with provi-
sions criminalizing illegal entry that failed  to provide an exception for refugees 
and asylum seekers. As of September 2021, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had granted, or started the administrative process for granting, refugee cards, along 
with special residency permits and work authorizations to 856 persons, most of them sub-Saharan Afric ans, whom the UN High Commiss ioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) had recognized in recent years. All of the 8,853 refugees recognized by UNHCR as of September 2021 
had access  to health services and where applica-
ble public education, but only about half of them had regular residency permits and work authorizations, according to UNHCR. Morocco also hosted 6,902 regis-
tered asylum seekers as of September. 
Human rights violations against migrants by Moroccan authorities, as reported 
by the media and non-governmental organizations during 2021, included 
abu-
sive raids  targeting sub-Saharan migrants for forced internal displacements, 
usually toward the south of the country, and arbitrary detention  of migrants, in-
cluding children. In a positive step, the Mor occan government stated it would in-
clude refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in its national Covid-19 vaccination campaign, which launched in January 2021. As of September, 547 refugees had 
been vaccinated. 
On July 19,  Idris Has an, an Uyghur act ivist who had been living in Turkey, was ar-
rested upon landing in Ca sablanca airport. A court agreed to China’s extradition 
request on December 15 but he had not been extradited yet at time of writing. Ex-traditing Hasan would violate Morocco’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee 
467HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHConvention and the 1984 Convention against Torture, which prohibit forcibly 
sending anyone to a place where they would risk persecution and torture. 
Key International Actors  
On September 29, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) annulled  two trade agree-
ments on agriculture and fishing between the European Union and Morocco. The court said that West ern Sahara, whic h was included in those bil ateral agree-
ments, should be considered a third party and  as such, its people had to give its 
“full consent” for the agreement to be valid. The ECJ ruled that the consultations with stakeholders in Western Sahara, in which the Polisario refused to take part, 
did not meet the threshold of “consent.” Morocco and the EU had not appealed the ECJ ruling at time of writing. 
468WORLD REPORT 2022Mozambique 
The human rights situation in Mozambique worsened in 2021, largely because 
of the ongoing violence in the northern Cabo Delgado province. The humanitar-ian cr isis in the province also det eriorated due to insecurity and vi olence, caus-
ing the displacement of over 
800,000 people . The armed group locally known as 
Al-Shabab or Al-Sunna wa Jama’a (ASWJ), which is linked to the Islamic State (ISIS), continued to att ack villages, kill civili ans, kidnap w omen and chi ldren, as 
well as to use boys as soldiers in its fight  against government forces. State secu-
rity forces were implicated in human rights abuses, including intimidation, sex-
ual exploitation of  displaced w omen, and the unlawful u se of force against 
civili ans.  
International partners, including Rwanda, the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC), Portugal, the United States, and the European Union re-sponded to the Mozambican government’s r equest for mi litary assist ance in op-
erations against ASWJ in Cabo Delgado
.  
Humanitarian Crisis in Cabo Delgado  
The humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado province continued to deteriorate 
due to intensified fighting between government security forces and ASWJ. As of September 2021, 
the Mozambican government  and the United Nations Refugee 
Agency, UNHCR, estimated that over 800,000 people had been internally dis-placed. Of these, about 48 percent were children, and over 84 percent lived in 
temporary accommodation and host communities across the country, while over 9 percent were in camps in Cabo Delgado, Niassa and Nampula provinces. The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) increased considerably in March, when more than 88,000 people fled Palma town, following a 
major attack  by 
ASWJ. Many of the fleeing civilians sought refuge in Quitunda village , about five 
kilometers from Palma, where they lacked wa ter, food, and other basic services. 
In July, the UN World Food Programme  (WFP) warned that northern Mozam-
bique’s displacement  crises risked becoming a hunger emergency as more fami-
lies continued to flee violence. As in the previous year, humanitarian groups 
were unable to reach communities most affected by the violence. The WFP sus-
469HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHpended food distribution  to Palma district in March due to security risks. Provi-
sion of assistanc e to displaced  people in isolat ed areas in Palma, Macomia, 
Mocimboa da Praia, Muidumbe, and Quissanga districts only resumed in Sep-tember, when access to the region improved. 
In September, allegations reemerged of se xual exploitation and abuse of women 
in exchange for humanitarian aid. An 
investigation by Mozambique’s Centre for 
Investigative Journalism  found that some aid workers demanded money or sex 
before distributing food parcels to w omen in various internally displaced per-
sons’ camps across Cabo Delgardo province. As of October, the government had not shown any public commitment to investigate these allegations. 
Abuses by Government Forces  
State security forces were implicated in human rights violations during countert-
errorism operations in northern Cabo Delgado province, including intimidation, ill-treat ment of displ aced people, and use of  unlawful force agains t civilians. 
Government soldiers prohibited people who fled the ASWJ Palma attack to 
Quitunda from leaving the village, and physi cally assaulted those caught trying 
to flee. A number of displaced people al so accused government forces deployed 
to Palma of forcing distressed residents to pay bribes to get space on rescue flights. As of October, the government had not  taken any publicly known step to 
investigate those abuses or punish those implicated. 
State security forces were also implicated in abuses outside the conflict zone, 
including against impri soned women. In July, a commiss ion of inquiry set  up by 
the Ministry of Justice 
confirmed sexual exploitation  and other rights violations 
against female inmates by guards at the Ndlavela Women’s Prison in Maputo. The comm ission was set  up following 
a report by the Centre for Public Integrity  
(CIP), a Mozambican anti-corruption organization that reported that prison guards took women inmates outside the prison and forced them “to have sexual relations w ith strangers outside the prison.” The Comm ission re commended, 
among other things, prison legislation reform that explicitly criminalizes sexual relations between inmates and guards, and  that women prisoners should be su-
pervised only by women guards.  
470WORLD REPORT 2022Abuses by Islamist Armed Groups   
ASWJ continued to attack villages, ki ll civili ans, kidnap w omen and chi ldren, and 
train boys to fight government forces. On March 24, the group raided the town of 
Palma , killing and inju ring an unknown num ber of civili ans, some in their 
homes, and di splacing thous ands. The grou p was al so implicated in the kidnap-
ping of boys  and subsequently using them to fight government forces in viola-
tion of the international prohibition on the u se of child soldiers. On October 5, 
the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF raised concerns that the insurgents 
were training and indoctrinating  boys to fight in Cabo Delgado. 
Human Rights Watch found evidence that  ASWJ fighters are using hundreds of 
kidnapped women and girls, in child and forced marriages, and as sex slaves. The group released others after their fami lies paid huge sums of money in ran-
som. In October, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that joint 
Mozambican and Rwandan forces  had freed an unknown number of women who 
were rescued from captivity. 
Attacks on Refugees and Asylum Seekers  
In June, the Mozambican government announced  that Tanzania would not create 
a refugee camp to accommodate Moza mbicans fleeing violence in Cabo Del-
gado. The government spokesman said the two governments had agreed  that 
fleeing citizens would be repatriated to Mozambique. These people have contin-
ued to be forcibly returned  by Tanzanian authorities. As of September, according 
to UNHCR, more than 10,300 asylum seekers had been sent back to Mozam-bique since the start of the year. 
Tanzania’s actions  violated the principle of non-
refoulement, which prohibits forcibly returning people to threats to their lives or freedom. 
Mozambican authorities failed to protect Rwandan asylum seekers in the country 
from attacks, and on at least one occas ion were implicated in the enforced dis-
appearance of a Rwandan national. Although the authorities denied knowledge of the where abouts of C assien Ntamuh anga, a Rwandan a sylum seeker who dis-
appeared on May 23, four witnesses 
told Human Rights Watch  that they saw 
seven uniformed agents of the Mozambican National Criminal Investigation Ser-
471HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHvice (SERNIC) arrest and take Ntamuhanga to the local police station on Inhaca 
island. Ntamuhanga’s whereabouts remained unknown at time of writing.  
On September 13, Révocat Karemangingo, a prominent member of the Rwandan 
refugee community  in Mozambique, and former Rwandan army offic ial, was shot 
dead by unknown individuals. In October, the Mozambican Human Rights De-fenders Network, (RMDDH), 
denounced threats from unknown individuals  
against a Rwandan refugee known as Innoc ent Abubakar. In September, mem-
bers of the Rwandan community in Mozambique told journalists  that they lived 
in fear following the killing of Karemangingo. 
Unresolved Kidnappings  
The number of unresolved cases of kidnappings, including of businesspeople or 
their relatives, continued to increase in 202 1, and police officers were implicated 
in at least one case. In June, according to media reports , the National Criminal 
Investigation Service (SERNIC) announced  the detention of five people including 
one SERNIC agent and a policeman, in connection with the kidnapping of a busi-nessman, Kapil Rajas. The ransom of US$600,000 demanded had not been paid when the police rescued Ra jas and arreste d three of his k idnappers. In August, 
the National H uman Rights Comm ission 
reportedly urged the purging  of Defense 
and Security Fo rces (FDS) ranks to  prevent sec urity forces fr om facilitating or cov-
ering up kidnapping crimes. 
At least six other kidnapping cases remained unresolved as of October, with 
three of them, including the case of a Portuguese national, happening within  
five days . The police said families of the victims refused to cooperate  with au-
thorities, choosing to pay ransom for their r elease while police investigation was 
ongoing. Earlier in April, Mozambique’s attorney general, Beatriz Buchilli, ex-
pressed concerns  about increas ing numbers of  kidnapping ca ses, noting difficul-
ties in resolving the existing 16 cases reported in 2020. In October, the 
Confederation of Business Associations of Mozambique (CTA), said kidnappings  
were “negatively affecting the business environment and private investment in Mozambique.” 
472WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors    
Various international partners responded  to the Mozambican government re-
quest for support  in its military operations against ASWJ in Cabo Delgado. In 
May, Portugal signed a five-year  military cooperation agreement  with Mozam-
bique that inc ludes a training mission of 60 troops. 
In July, Rwanda responded with the deployment of 1,000 soldiers and policemen  
to Cabo Delgado. A month later, the two governments reported that their joint forces 
had recovered control  of Mocimboa da Praia, a town seized and occupied 
by insurgents since August 2020. Also in July, the European Council adopted a 
decis ion setting up an Eur opean Union milit ary tr aining m ission in Mozambique 
to support government  forces in the pr otection of civili ans and resto ration of 
safety and security in the Cabo Delgado province. 
In September, United States special forc es conducted an exercise with Mozambi-
can troops which the US said incorporated components of human rights, the laws of war, protection of civili ans, and engagement  with civil soc iety.  
In October, SADC 
extended indefinitely  its SADC Mission in Mozambique 
(SAMIM), which it launched  in July for an initial three-month t erm. The m ission’s  
troop contributing countries include South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania, and An-
gola.  
473HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMyanmar 
The military coup on February 1, 2021, effectively ended the democratic transi-
tion under Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD). The NLD was poised to retu rn to power for another five years after w inning landslide gen-
eral elections in November 2020. Instead, under the military State Administra-tion Council (SAC) junta led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, soldiers and police rounded up hundreds of members of parliament, including Aung San Suu Kyi 
and senior NLD party members, and held them in arbitrary detention for months, many of them in undisclosed locations.  
The military seized power making unfounded claims of widespread and system-
atic election and voter irregularities, although international and domestic 
elec-
tion observers  found that the election was “credib le and reflect ed the will of the 
majority of the voters.”  
The junta brought multiple charges  against Aung San Suu Kyi, including for cor-
ruption, incitement, and breaching the Official  Secrets Act. Three of her deposed 
cabinet ministers and an Australian ec onomic adviser also faced charges under 
the Official Secrets Act.  
Millions took to the streets across the country in largely peaceful protests to call 
for the military to relinquish power,  while members of parliament, ethnic minor-
ity representative s, and civil society act ivists f ormed the oppos ition National 
Unity Government (NUG). The security fo rces responded by committing offenses 
amounting to crimes against humanity  against the civili an population, including 
torture, severe deprivation of liberty, enf orced disappearances, rape and other 
sexual abuse, and inhumane treatment . Journalists, lawyers, medical personnel, 
anti-junta proteste rs, civil society act ivists, women, and many  others continue to 
be at high risk of arbitrary arrest. 
Between February 1 and November 1, the police and military killed at least 1,200 
protesters  and bystanders, including approximately  75 children, and have de-
tained over 8700  government offic ials, act ivists, journalists, and  civil ser vants. 
On March 14, the junta  imposed martial law  in several townships across Yangon 
and began to enforce additional restrictions in other parts of the country. On May 13, the junta also imposed 
martial law  in Chin State’s Mindat  township after 
474WORLD REPORT 2022clashes between security forces and  lightly armed opposition militias. Under 
martial law orders, direct  authority over the to wnships was tr ansferred to the re-
spective regional military commanders.  
Since the coup, the militar y has intensified military operations  against ethnic 
armed groups in some areas, such as C hin State. The military’s indiscriminate 
use of artillery and airstrikes has reportedly  injured and kil led civi lians, dam-
aged villages, including schools, and  forced thousands to flee. 
Post-Coup Crimes against Humanity 
The security forces have engaged in widespread and systematic attacks  on civil-
ians throughout Myanmar, including killing protesters, enforced disappearance 
of opposition supporters, torture, sex ual abuse, rape of some detainees, and 
mass po litical detentions. On February 21, 2 021, the junta  stated  in the 
state’s  Global New Light of Myanmar : “Protesters are now inciting the people, 
especially emotional teenagers and y outh, to a confrontation path where they 
will suffer the loss of life.” 
Many of the 1,200 people killed by police and military since the coup were pro-
testers and bystanders in cities and towns across Myanmar, including Yangon, Mandalay, Bago, Monywa, and other townships in Sagaing Region, Mindat town-
ship in Chin State, and many other locations. International human rights 
standards  permit law enforcement officials to use lethal force only as a 
last resort when there is an imminent threat to  life. But in numerous cases in 
2021 reported by the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, other human rights organizations, and 
media,  security forces fired on demonstrators who 
were unarmed and posed no apparent threat. 
The UN reported that on March 3, security forces across the country fired live 
rounds at protesters,  killing at least 38  and wounding more than 100. Killings 
were also reported in one day in Monywa, Sagaing Region; Myingyan and Man-dalay, Mandalay Region; Salin, Magway Region; and Mawlamyine, Mon State, ac-cording to 
media  reports . On March 13, authorities killed at least nine protesters, 
including five in the Sein Pan area of Mandalay, when security forces shot into a 
crowd . On March 14 in Hlaing Tharyar township, Yangon, security forces killed an 
475HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHestimated 66 people, according to the Assistanc e Association for Politic al Pris-
oners.  
The M RTV news ch annel announced  the day before Armed Forces Day, on March 
27 , that demonstrators “should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back.” On March 27 , secu-rity forces followed through on that threat by carrying out violent crackdowns on protesters in at least 40 towns and cities, killing dozens.  
On April 9, military personnel  killed an estimated 
82 people in Bago  in a dawn 
assault on protesters’ barricades and encampments; exact figures have been difficult to determine due to a strong security presence and lack of access to the area by reporters or independent investigators. 
Many persons detained for taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations said 
after their release that security personnel 
tortured and otherwise ill-treated  them 
and others in custody. Methods of tor ture included beatings, mock executions 
with guns, burning with cigarettes, and rape and threatened rape.  
The junta has ta ken into custody more than 100 politic ians, election officials, 
journalists, act ivists, and protesters, and refused to confirm their wher eabouts 
or conditions of detention in violation of international law. Security forces fre-quently 
detained family members , including children and older people , when 
they were unable to find the individual they sought to arrest. 
Threats to Rohingya  
Authorities have been committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid , per-
secution, and severe deprivation of liberty against 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Rakhine State. Most Rohingya had fled the country following the military’s campaign of killings, rape, and arson th at resulted in crimes against humanity 
and genocidal acts in 2017.  
Approximately 130,000 Rohingya have been confined to open-air detention 
camps in central Rakhine State since being displaced by ethnic cleansing in 2012, in violation of their fundamental right to return home. They are denied freedom of movement in what amounts to arbitrary and discriminatory depriva-tion of liberty.  
476WORLD REPORT 2022Following the coup, restrictions on humanitarian access increased , leading to 
preventable  deaths and illnesses in Rohingya camps and villages. In late May, 
nine children reportedly died  Rakhine State following an outbreak of acute wa-
tery diarrhea .  
Threats to Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Women have led and taken part in mass protests as pa rt of the C ivil Disobedi-
ence Movement (CDM) against the junta. Female protesters were some of the 
first killed  by security forces and arbitrarily detained. Many women reported 
being beaten by security forces during their arrests, and some reported credible 
allegations of sexual violence and humiliating treatment  by security forces dur-
ing their detention.  
Trafficking of women and girls remains a serious problem in Shan and Kachin 
States, where c onflict and economic  desperation has m ade them vulnerable to 
being lured to China under false promises and sold into sexual slavery and 
forced reproduction as “brides.”  
The NLD government, prior to the coup, was unable to p ass the Prevention of  Vi-
olence Against Woman Law. While the law had been criticized for falling well 
short of intern ational st andards, the absence of targeted legi slation has stal led 
efforts to pr event gender -based violence, assist survivo rs, and bring perpetra tors 
to justice. 
Freedom of Expression and Media 
As of October 25, Myanmar’s junta had arrested 98 journalists, 46 of whom re-
mained in det ention, according to the A ssistanc e Association for Political  Prison-
ers. Six journalists had been convicted, including five for violating  section 505A 
of the penal code,  a new pro vision that makes it a crime to pub lish or circulate 
comments that “cause fear” or spread “f alse news.” In such prosecutions, “false 
news” appears to be any news that the authorities do not want to reach the pub-
lic. 
On March 8, the junta  stripped media licenses  from five local outlets: Demo-
cratic Voice of Burma (DVB), Khit Thit Media, Mizzima, Myanmar Now, and 7Day. 
477HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn May 4, authorities banned two other outlets, the Kachin-based 74 Media and 
the Shan-based  Tachileik News Agency, and also banned satellit e tele vision.  
Also, on May 4, authorities arrested US journalist Danny Fenster, the managing 
editor of  Frontier Myanmar , and detained him on politically motivated charges. 
On November 12, a court sent enced him to 11 years’ hard l abor, but he was per-
mitted to leave the country on November 15. 
On June 30, the Ministry of Information  issued a warning  to journalists to stop 
describing the SAC as a “junta” or face prosecution.  
Internet Shutdowns  
In the weeks following the coup, the ju nta imposed nationwide internet shut-
downs from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m., which were later lifted, but authorities continued to 
block many websites and throttled internet speeds throughout  the year. Blocks 
to mobile data and networks also continued across 22 townships  where anti-
junta opposition resulted in heavy clashes between the Myanmar military and pro-democracy militia groups. 
Threats to Humanitarian Aid  
Increased fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups in the 
border ar eas in C hin, Kachin, Karen, Kayah, and Shan St ates has increa sed strain 
on access and limited humanitarian aid to  those areas. The UN said, in July, at 
least 3 million people needed humanitarian aid—an increase of 2 million since 
February 1—and food shortages were r eported in parts of Chin and Rakhine 
States.  
Anti-Junta Militias  
Militias have formed around the country since the coup to oppose the junta and 
target security forces. Many of the mi litias have adopted the title of People’s De-
fense Forces, the same name the NUG adopted  for the nationwide force it cre-
ated. However, not all the recently formed  People’s Defense Forces are linked to 
the NUG or take orders from its command structure.  
478WORLD REPORT 2022These militias began conducting small-scale att acks against the military in July. 
In Sagaing and Magway  Regions and Chin  State, intense fighting between the 
militias and the military reportedly killed  hundreds of troops. The military re-
sponded with increased raids and by burning villages. Some militias have car-
ried out unlawful bombings of buildings and targeted killings  of civilian 
supporters of the military. 
On September 7 , acting NUG President Duwa La shi La declared a “defen sive w ar” 
against the military junta. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
Myanmar’s penal code punishes “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” with up to 10 years in prison and a fine. 
The opposition NUG reported that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
people have been particularly vulnerable to sexual violence in custody. One transgender woman recounted after her r elease that  she was 
raped in 
custody  with an object, tortured, and severely beaten. 
Covid-19 and Attacks on Healthcare Workers 
By November 2021, just 13  percent of My anmar’s 54 mi llion population was fully 
vaccinated. A total 17 ,998 deaths  were recorded by the Ministry of Health be-
tween March 2020 and October 2021, although the actual numbers are likely 
much higher.  
The junta has ha rassed, arbitr arily arrested, and  attacked medical professionals, 
sometimes as they treated injured protester s. Healthcare workers were early 
leaders of the opposition Civil Disobedience Mo vement and refused to work in 
government hospitals as a form of protest. In the nine months following the coup, at least 260 healthcare workers were attacked while trying to administer 
medical aid, and 20 killed. The AAPP said 76 remained in detention in Septem-ber, and as many as 600 healthcare workers had outstanding arrest warrants against them. Many have been forced to work underground in makeshift mobile clinics to treat Covid-19 patients or have gone into hiding to evade arrest. The UN Country Team in Myanm ar has s aid that  attacks on healthcare worker s have jeop-
479HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHardized the Covid-19 response and prev ented patients from receiving health 
care. 
Key International Actors  
In February, the UN Human Rights Council held a special session and adopted by 
consensus a resolution deploring the remova l of the elected government and 
calling for the unconditional release of a ll those arbitrarily detained. A further 
resolution was adopted at the coun cil’s March se ssion “condemning in the 
strongest t erms” the military depos ition of the civili an government, and high-
lighting the need for accountability.  
In June, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution strongly con-
demning the February 1 coup. The General Assembly also made several impor-tant recommendations, including calling for all members states to prevent the 
flow of arms into Myanmar. The UN Security Coun cil did not follo w up and  pass a 
legally binding resolution of its own th at would impose a global ban on the 
transfer of weapons and dual-use technologies to Myanmar. 
Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States have 
imposed targeted sanctions against Myanm ar’s top military officials and mem-
bers of the junta, conglomerates, and c ompanies owned or controlled by the mil-
itary. However, foreign governments did not impose sanctions on oil and gas revenues, the junta’s main source of revenues.  
In October, the US Congress introduced the 
BURMA Act 2021 , supporting author-
ization of further targeted sanctions and recommended the US government make a Rohingya genocide determination. The European Parliament also 
supported  
recognizing the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar and urged further EU sanctions against military-owned  businesses. While the EU expressed
 sup-
port  for the Association of Southeast As ian Nations (ASEAN) as a mediator with 
the Myanmar military, it also condemned the coup in “ the strongest terms .”  
The UN-backed Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) is 
mandated to build case files to support efforts to hold individuals legally ac-countable for serious international crimes. The IIMM is “closely monitoring” 
events and is collecting evidence of 
such crimes  committed following the coup, 
480WORLD REPORT 2022and said if substantiated, the alleged violations could amount to crimes against 
humanity.  
On April 24, ASEAN negotiated a five-point consensus plan  with the military, and 
appointed Brunei diplomat Erywan Yusof  as special envoy. The military’s failure 
to implement the five-point plan led ASEAN to exclude  junta leader Senior Gen. 
Min Aung Hlaing from its October summit.  
At the International Criminal Court, the prosecutor is investigating Myanmar for 
the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution, based on the com-
pletion of these crimes in Bangladesh, an ICC member,  following the 2017 ethnic 
cleansing campaign against the Rohingya. In July, citing Article 12(3) of the ICC Statute, the NUG lodged a declaration with the ICC accepting the court’s jurisdic-tion over crimes committed in Myanmar since July 1, 2002.  
Gambia’s case alleging Myanmar’s violation of the Genocide Convention contin-
ued before the International Court of Justice, with 
Myanmar raising preliminary 
objections  to the court’s juri sdiction and the adm issibility of Ga mbia’s applica-
tion.

Inadequate and u nequal acce ss to health ca re in Nepal was exacerb ated in 2021 
by government failures to prepare or respond effectively when the Covid-19 pan-
demic surged, leading to many preventable deaths.  
A per vasive cultur e of impunity  continues to undermine fundamental human 
rights in the country. Ongoing human rights violations by the police and army, in-cluding cases of alleged 
extrajudicial killings  and custodial deaths resulting 
from torture, are rarely  investigated, and when they are , alleged perpetrators are 
almost never arrested. 
Serious rights challenges remained unaddressed for months in 2021 during in-
ternal po litical infighting, the go vernment was largely  paralyzed  by a struggle 
over the post of prime minister and repeat ed dissolutions of parliament. After 
the Supreme Court ordered in July that Sher Bahadur Deuba replace K.P . Oli as 
prime minister, the positions of health and education minister were left vacant for three months.  
Both the Oli and Deuba governments continued to block justice for conflict-era 
violations. The manda tes of the two transition al justice comm issions we re once 
again extended, although neither has m ade progress s ince being establi shed in 
2015 to provide truth to victims, establish the fate of the “disappeared,” and promote accountability and reconciliation.  
In March the government signed a peace agreement with a banned Maoist splin-

Nepal Communist Party  (NCP), after it agreed to renounce violence.

During a major wave of Covid-19 infections, which peaked in May, senior health officials described a system at the breaking point, with patients dying due to 
lack of bottled oxygen . 
The government had failed to prepare  for the scale of the outbreak. The situation 
was made wor se by a short age of vaccines, reflecting both global scarcity—
wealthy governments blocked an intellectual pr operty waiver that would have al-

births at health facilities , which were overstretched by 
the pandemic. Th is was accomp anied by increases in neon atal de aths, still 
births, and pre-term births. 
Nepal had made progress  in reducing child labor in recent years , but the eco-
nomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, t ogether with school closures and inad-
equate government  assist ance, pushed children back  into exploitative and 
dangerous child labor. 
Transitional Justice  
The Truth and Reconcili ation Comm ission (TRC) and the Commiss ion of Investi-
gation on Enforced Disappeared Persons  (CIEDP) were established in 2015, but 
despite receiving over 60,000 complaints of abuses committed during the 1996-2006 conflict, they have made no progress.  
Successive  governments have pr omised to bring the Enforced Di sappear ances 
Enquiry, Truth and Reconcil iation Comm ission Act (2014) into conf ormity with in-
ternational law as directed by the Supreme Court in 2015 but have failed to do 
so. The Office of the UN High Comm issioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has c riti-
cized the act for failing to comply w ith Nepal’s international legal obligations by 
giving the comm ission powers to re commend amnesties for gross viol ations of 
international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitar-ian law, avoiding or delaying criminal p rosecutions, and failing to ensure inde-
pendence and impartiality. The United Nations and international community therefore do not  support these commiss ions. 
Meanwhile, the authorities have 
prevented cases  of conflict era violations from 
being heard in the regular courts on the gr ounds that they will be addressed by 
the transitional justice process, although no meaningful or credible transitional justice process exists. 
Victims’ groups  have long called for the government to 
consult with victims  before reappointing comm issioners, but one of the fi rst ac-
485HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtions of Sher Ba hadur Deuba upon becoming prime mini ster in July 2021 was to 
extend the comm issioner s’ terms for another year.  
Survivors of sexual violence  committed during the conflict suffered from a partic-
ular lack of support or interim relief.  
Rule of Law   
Impunity for human rights abuses extends to ongoing violations, undermining the principles of accountability and rule of law in post-conflict Nepal. In October, 
police shot 
dead  four people in Rupandehi district while attempting to evict 
landless settlers from government land. UN rights experts have repeatedly raised 
cases  of killings by the security forces but none have led to prosecutions, al-
though the government acknowledged  that one victim had been tortured in po-
lice custody.  
A partial ex ception was the ca se of Rajkumar Chepang , who died in July 2020 
after being tortured by soldiers guarding C hitwan National Park. In July 2021 a 
soldier was found guilty by Chitwan dist rict court, in what is believed to be the 
first successful prosecution for tortur e in Nepal s ince it was c riminalized  in do-
mestic law  in 2018. Howe ver, he was sentenced  to only nine months in jail. 
In December 2020, the then government of K.P . Oli amended the law governing 
the Constitutional Council , which makes appointments to the National Human 
Rights C ommiss ion, and then appointed new human rights comm issioner s with-
out proper consul tation with oppo sition member s. Because parli ament was dis-
solved, the new comm issioner s were sworn in without parliamentary approval.  
The same proce ss was used to make other appointments, including to the Elec-
tion Comm ission.  
In October 2021 police detained a human rights defender, Ruby Khan , on false 
charges of “polygamy,” and  initially defied a Supreme Court h abeas corpus  order 
to release her, after she led a pro test demanding police investigate the alleged 
murder of two women.  
486WORLD REPORT 2022Women’s and Girls’ Rights   
Nepal has one of the highest rates  of child marriage  in Asia, with 33 percent of 
girls marrying  before 18 years and 8 percent married by age 15. Among boys, 9 
percent marry before the age of 18. This situation worsened  during the pan-
demic , as children were pushed out of education and families faced increased 
poverty. 
Nepal’s 2006 Citizenship Act, as well as the 2015 constitution, contain provi-
sions that discriminate against women. A draft bill to amend the Citizenship Act, 
first presented to  parliament in 2018 , retains several discrimin atory provisions. 
In September 2020, three UN human rights experts wrote  to the government rais-
ing concerns that “the bill would continue to discriminate systematically against women, regarding their ability to trans mit citizenship through marriage and to 
their children.” Due to flawed citizenship l aws, an estimated 5 million people are 
forced to live without citizenship and are at risk of 
statelessness . 
Reported cases  of rape continued to sharply increase in 2021, but the police 
were often reluctant to register cases and investigations  were frequently ineffec-
tive, resulting in widespread impunity  for sexual violence. 
Following Nepal’s Universal Period Review , the government began consultations  
to update the criminal code to better safeguard the recognized right to abortion.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
The bill to amend the Citizenship Act also c ontains a clause that would require 
transgender people to provide “proof” of their transition to access citizenship documents according to their gender identity—which violates international human rights law and a 2007 Nepal Supreme Court judgment mandating that gender identity be recognized based on “self-feeling.” 
While Nepal was among the first countries in the world to prot ect social and po-
litical rights for LGBT people—including legal recognition of a third gender—cases of discrimination and police abuse 
continue .  
487HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTreatment of Minorities   
Caste-based violence and discrimination against Dalits are rarely investigated  or 
prosecuted, despite the adoption of the Caste-based Discrimination and Un-
touchability (Crime and Punishment) Act  in 2011. Two emblematic cases of caste-
based killings committed on May 23, 2020 , are yet to be prosecuted. One 
involved the de ath of a 12 -year-old Dalit girl a day after she was fo rced to marry 
her alleged rapist, and the second, the killing of six men in Rukum West district after a young Dalit man arrived to marry his girlfriend from another caste. 
Key International Actors   
Nepal’s most important international re lationships are with neighbors India and 
China, which compete for influence in Nepal. Both provided vaccine and other assistanc e to help Nepal cope with the pandemic, although India failed to keep 
up supplies during a surge in cases in early 2021 as it 
battled a devastating sec-
ond wave  of its own. 
Nepal is a participant in the Chinese go vernment’s “Belt and Road Initiative.” It 
continues to restrict free assembly and expression rights of its Tibetan commu-nity under pressure from Chinese authorities. 
The Nepal government remains dependent f or much of its budget on interna-
tional development aid. Several of Nepal’s 
donors have funded programs  for 
many years intended to support respect for human rights, police reform, access to justice, and respect for the rule of la w, but have not pressed the government 
to advance transitional justice or end the impunity of the security forces. 
Nepal is serving a second consecutive term on the UN Human Rights Council 
from 2021-2023. 
488WORLD REPORT 2022Nicaragua 
Since taking office in 2007 , the government of Pres ident Daniel Or tega has dis-
mantled nearly all institutional checks on presidential power. The Electoral 
Council, stacked with the president’s supporters, removed opposition lawmak-ers in 2016 and has barred opposition political  parties ahead of  the 2 021 presi-
dential elections. A constitutional amendment approved by President Ortega’s party, which controls the National Assembly, abolished term limits in 2014. Pres-ident Ortega was elected to a fourth consecutive  term in Novem ber amid govern-
ment repression of critics and the po litical opposition. Many governments from 
the region and Europe said the elections had not met minimum guarantees to be considered free and fair. 
To pave the way for his re-election, authorities arbitrarily arrested and prose-
cuted government critics and political opponents, including presidential candi-dates, journalists, lawyers, and leader s of community, business, and student 
groups.  
Police abuses committed during a brutal crackdown by the National Police and 
armed pro-government groups in 2018 have gone unpunished.  
Persistent problems include severe restrictions on freedom of expression and 
association, political discrimination, and stringent restrictions on abortion. 
Detention and Prosecution of Critics 
Between late May and October 2021, authoritie s arbitrarily detained 7 presiden-
tial candidates and 32 prominent gov ernment critics. Prosec utors opened inves-
tigations against most on alleged “treason” charges.   
Since February, an amendment to the Code of  Criminal  Procedure has allowed 
prosecutors to request detentions of up to 90 days without charge; in most 
cases involving critics, courts have permitted them. 
In August, the Attorney General’s Office filed  charges against most of the de-
tainees, in criminal proceedings that la cked basic due process guarantees. 
Charges, carrying prison sentences of 15 to 25 years, ranged from money laun-
dering to, most commonly, “conspiracy to undermine national integrity.” Prose-
489HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcutors failed to identify specific acts by the defendants to support the charges in 
at least 14 cases. 
Most critics have been held incommunicado and subjected to abuses in deten-
tion, including daily interrogations, prolonged  solitary confinement, and insuffi-
cient food. Authorities have barred critic s’ lawyers from participating in public 
hearings, ass igning public defenders inste ad. Despite repeat ed requests, most 
lawyers had no access to court documents for months. 
Right to Vote and Run for Office  
Election-related changes and laws adopt ed between October 2020 and February 
2021 have been used to deter critical speech, inhibit opposition participation in 
elections, and keep critics in prison without formal charges, to prevent or limit their political participation.  
In December 2020, the National Assembly passed the Law for the Defense of 
People’s Rights to Independence, Sover eignty, and Self-determination for Peace, 
prohibiting so-called “traitors” from running for or holding public office. The law 
defines “traitors” in sweep ing terms to include, f or example, people who “un-
dermine independence, sovereignty and self-determination” or “damage the supreme interests of the nation.” 
In May 2021, the National Assembly approved a legal reform consolidating gov-
ernment control of the electoral proc ess. The reform codifies troubling new 
grounds for excluding c andidates; does not requir e independent domestic or in-
ternational electoral observation, which the Organization of American States and the United Nations Human Rights Council deemed essential to ensure credible scrutiny of the elections; and allows the National Police to authorize demonstra-tions in public spaces, including public campaign events. 
After the National Assembly, which is allied with Ortega, appointed new 
Supreme Electoral Council members in May, the Council stripped legal registra-tion from the main opposition parties. 
490WORLD REPORT 2022Covid-19 Response 
Denial, inaction, and opacity have ch aracterized the government’s response to 
the Covid-19 pandemic. The government took no emergency measures in re-sponse to the pandemic, kept schools open, and  fired doctors critical of the gov-
ernment who disagreed with its management of the Covid-19 response. 
While the government reported over 13,000 cases and more than 200 deaths, as 
of September 2021, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Covid-19 Citizen Observatory registered almost twice as many suspected cases and 4,500 sus-pected deaths. The government has accused the organization and critic al doc-
tors of promoting “health terrori sm.” The Inter-American C ommiss ion on H uman 
Rights (IACHR) r eported that “state agents” we re persecuting and  harassing 
members of the Observatory, as well as from the medical associations Nicaraguan Medical Unit (UMN) and Interdisciplinary Scientific Committee. 
As of October 202 1, just over 8 perc ent of the po pulation was fully vaccinated. 
During the 2018 crackdown, at least 405 doct ors, nurses, and other health work-
ers were fired from public hospitals, seemingly for providing care to protesters or criticizing the government.   
No specific policies to diminish the neg ative economic impact of the pandemic 
were enacted. 
Crackdown on Protesters 
Police, in coordination with armed pro-gov ernment groups, brutally repressed 
massive anti-government protests in 2018, le aving at leas t 328 dead, some 
2,000 injured, and hundreds detained. Authorities reported 21 police officers 
killed in the context of demonstrations.  
Many protestors were detained for months, subjected to torture and ill-treatment 
including electric shocks, sev ere beatings, fingernail removal, asphyxiation, and 
rape. Serious violations of due process and other rights marred prosecutions.  
A broad amnesty that released many protestors in 2019 has contributed to im-
munity from prosecution f or those responsible for human rights violations re-
lated to the crackdown. In 2019, President Ortega promoted top officials

In addition to the 39 detentions carried out since late May 2021, Nicaraguan 
rights groups reported that over 100 perceived critics detained earlier remained under custody as of  October. Many had been held f or over a yea r, under abusive 
conditions. 
Attacks on Human Rights Defende rs and Independent Media  
Human rights defenders and other critics are targets of death threats, assaults, 
intimidation, ha rass ment, surveillanc e, online defamation c ampaigns, and arbi-
trary detention and prosecution. Police frequently station themselves outside the houses of government critics, preventing them from leaving, in what 
amounts to arbi trary arrest. Those haras sed are unab le to visit f riends and fam-
ily, attend meetings, go to work, or particip ate in protests or political activities. 
Some have been detained repeatedly —sometimes being abused during deten-
tion—for periods ranging from several days to several months.  
The government restricts freedom of expression for journalists and media outlets 
through threats, physical att acks, detentions, arbitrary financial investigations, 
arbitrary prosecutions, and forced closures.  
Between July 28 and August 26, 2021, authorities ordered the closure of 45 
NGOs, including women’s groups, international  aid organizations, and several 
medical associations. Ten others had been closed since 2018. In 2019, Army Commander in Chief Julio César Avilés Castillo called NGOs “coup-plotters”.  
Other organizations have announced their suspension of activities after the Law 
for the Regulation of Foreign Agents went  into effect in 2020, requiring the regis-
tration of people and groups rece iving foreign funding as “foreign agents” and 
preventing them from running for office. 
Police raided the offices of the newspaper Confidencial  in May 2021, confiscat-
ing equipment and detaining a journalist for several hours without providing warrants for the detention or raid. The newspaper La Prensa  ended its print edi-
tion in August, when the Customs Authority withheld newsprint and ink supplies 
493HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHit had imported. National Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office later raided 
its facilities, seizing items and arresting the newspaper’s general manager. 
Between January and October 2021, authorities ha d arbitrarily arrested and pros-
ecuted three journalists and brought ch arges or initiated in vestigations against 
several journalists who were abroad. At least 16 journalists have been sum-moned as witnesses in a money lau ndering investigation into Cristiana 
Chamorro, a detained presidential candidate who, until its closure, headed an 
NGO dedicated to press freedom.  
Doctors and journalists have been thr eatened with charges under Nicaragua’s 
cybercrime law during interviews with pro secutors, according to news media. 
The law, passed in October 2020, criminalizes a wide range of online communi-cations, including by punishing with sentences of up to five years the “publica-tion” or “dissemination” of “false” or “distorted” information on the internet that is “likely to spread anxiety, anguish or fear.” 
On September 7 , 202 1, the Attorney Gener al’s Office ch arged act ivist Am aru Ruíz 
under the cyberc rime law. He was accused of “dissemin ation of fal se informa-
tion” to “instill instability and insecurity that endanger s national sovereignty” 
after he allegedly said “the state and its ins titutions had deliberately failed to in-
vestigate” the murders of  Indigenous persons in the North Caribbean Coast in 
2020 and 2021. 
Defense lawyers have ex perienced escal ating ha rassment and prosecutions. 
Some remain in the country, facing threats, and others have fled. Two were ar-rested and prosecuted for “conspiracy to undermine national integrity.” 
The Human Rights Collective “Nicaragua Nunca +”, an NGO based in Costa Rica 
that documents human rights abuses in Nicaragua, reported that the Ortega gov-ernment’s sustained  “persecution, ha rass ment, and prosecution” had forced at 
least 100 journalists into exile, including 25 in 2021.  
In August 2021, at least nine Indigenous persons were reportedly killed, and two 
women sexually abused, in an attack rela ted to a dispute over gold mining in the 
Mayangna Sauni As Indigenous territory.  The government granted the mining 
concession without prior consultation with the community. Homicides and ag-gressions “related to t erritorial disputes” in the area  since January 2020 “remain 
494WORLD REPORT 2022unpunished,” the United Nations Office  of the High Comm issioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) reported. Both OHCHR and the IACHR point to a larger, persistent failure of the Nicaraguan government to  title and protect  Indigenous territories 
from invasions. 
Women and Girls’ Sexual and Reproductive Rights 
Nicaragua has prohibite d abortion under all circumst ances sinc e 2006, even 
when a pregnancy is life-threatening or resu lts from rape or incest. Those who 
have abortions face prison sentences of up  to two years; medical professionals 
who perform them can face up to six yea rs. The ban forces women and girls con-
fronting unwanted pregnancies to seek illegal and unsafe abortions, risking their health and lives. 
Rates of domestic abuse, violenc e against women, and femicide, defined in 
Nicaraguan law as a crime committed by a man who murders a woman “in the public or private sphere,” have increased since 2019, OHCHR reported in Febru-ary 2021. 
Nicaraguan Asylum Seekers 
From April 2018 through June 2021, mor e than 110,000 people fled Nicaragua, 
the UN High Comm issioner for Refugees reported. Costa Rica hosts some 80,000 
Nicaraguan refugees and asylum seekers. Thousands more live in Mexico, 
Panama, Europe, and the United States.  
Key International Actors 
No international monitoring bodies have been allowed into the country since 2018, when the government expelled the IACHR Special Monitoring Mechanism for Nicaragua, the IACHR-appoint ed Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Ex-
perts, and OHCHR.  
In February 2021, OHCHR urged the government to enact meaningful electoral re-
forms, end arbi trary arres ts, guarantee freedoms  to civi l society, inv estigate and 
prosecute rights abuses in the context of protests, and amend laws that seri-ously restrict rights to freedom of expression and association and could under-
495HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmine free and fair elections. The IACHR has also continued to monitor the situa-
tion from afar. 
The UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution in March urging the govern-
ment to repeal or amend legislation that undermines fundamental rights and to adopt electoral reforms to ensure free and fair elections with international over-
sight. 
In June, the OAS Permanent Council expressed concern that the Ortega regime 
had not implemented electoral reforms c onsistent with international standards 
before a dead line set for May. The resolution condemned harassment and arbi-
trary restrictions on presidential candidates, opposition parties, and independ-ent media. In November, the OAS Permanent Council condemned the elections saying they “were not free, fair or tr ansparent, and lack[ed] democratic legiti-
macy.” 
As of September, the US Treasury Depar tment had imposed targeted sanctions 
on 26 Nicaraguans for abuses or corruption, including 23 pursuant to Executive Order 13851 and 3 pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Act of 2016, which allows for sanctions against human rights violat ors. Of the 26, 6 were also sanctioned 
pursuant to the Nicaraguan Human Rights and Corruption Act of 2018. The Treas-ury Department has al so sanctioned nine entities, including financial and  state 
security institutions.  
In November, the US Congress passed  the RENACER Act to monitor, report on, 
and address corruption by the Ortega government, as well as human rights abuses by Nicaraguan security forces. The law had been approved by the Senate in August. 
The European Parliament, in July, condemned  the Ortega government’s repres-
sion of opposition groups and other opponents and  called for the release of arbi-
trarily detained political prisoners, inc luding presidential candidates. In August, 
the EU imposed targeted sanctions on eight  more Nicaraguans accused of “seri-
ous human rights violations” and undermining democracy, including Vice Presi-dent Rosario Murillo, for a total of 14 Nicaraguans sanctioned since 2020. Sanctions against all 14 were renewed f or another year in October 2021. Follow-
ing EU foreign ministers’ discussions in Oc tober, EU foreign policy chief Josep 
Borrell once again condemned the Nicaraguan government’s repression, refer-
496WORLD REPORT 2022ring to it as ‘one of the worst dictato rships in the world’, who se scheduled elec-

In July, Canada imposed targeted sanctions on 15 government officials impli-
cated in human rights violations, for a total of 24 sanctioned.

“Between Hunger and the Virus” 
The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on People Living in Poverty in Lagos, Nigeria 
HUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Nigeria 
The Nigerian government’s ban on Twitter in June, after the social media com-
pany deleted a tweet by President Muhammed Buhari for violating its rules, sig-naled a worsening repression of fundament al rights in the country. The ban was 
widely condemned by citizens who rely on the platform for critical social and po-litical discourse.  
The reported death of Boko Haram le ader Abubakar Shek au in June changed the 
dynamics of the conflict in the northeast and strengthened the breakaway Is-lamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). In September, the Nigerian air force admitted that it had carried out an 
airstrike on a village in Yobe State  that killed 
10 civi lians and inju red 20. A spokesperson claimed  the civilians were struck er-
roneously while the air forc e was res ponding to reported Boko  Haram and  ISWAP 
activities in the area, and that it had set up a board of inquiry to investigate. Au-
thorities have not released any inform ation on the progress or outcome of the in-
vestigation.  
The International Criminal Court (ICC) determined in December 2020 that an ICC 
investigation is warranted for crimes c ommitted in the Boko Haram-related con-
flict given inadequate domestic efforts to deliver justice for the crimes and after 
finding “reasonab le basis to believe” the grou p, its breaka way f actions, and 
Nigerian security forces had committed w ar crimes and crimes against humanity. 
Communities in the northwest wi tnessed a spate  of mass k idnappings of  school-
children for ransom. Over 1,000 children were kidnapped  between January and 
August 2021 by armed groups popularly known as bandits, according to Save the Children International.  
There has yet to be accoun tability for vio lence and other abuses  against protest-
ers during the October 2020 #EndSARS pro tests against police brutality, includ-
ing when security forces shot at peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos. 
Nigerians continue to grapple with the devastating economic impact of Covid-19, 
as the 
number of citizens experiencing hunger more than doubled during the 
pandemic . Although authorities sought to respond  by introducing or expanding 
measures such as cash transfers and food  assist ance, only a tiny fr action of 
499HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHthose needing support received it. This is la rgely due to the ab sence of a robust 
social protection system that recognizes and protects people’s right to an ade-
quate standard of living. 
Violence in the Northwest  
Armed groups known locally as bandits carried out widespread killings, kidnap-
pings, and looting across several sta tes in Nigeria’s northwest region. These 
groups emerged following years of  conflict between nomadic herdsmen and 
farming communities. According to SBM Intelligence , a Nigerian research organi-
zation, 519 people were kidnapped and 22 people killed in k idnapping-related 
incidents in northwestern Z amfara State alone between January and June. The 
activities of these groups have al so caused  massive displacement .  
In response to the insecurity, President Buhari ordered airstrikes on the camps 
of suspected bandits, while some gov ernors in the region have attempted 
amnesty deals resulting in pardons for criminal acts by bandits in exchange for peace, but most have failed. In September, authorities imposed a 
telecommuni-
cations shutdown in parts of the northwest  to disrupt communication among the 
bandits.   
Separatist Agitations in the South 
Simmering separatist agitations from the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in 
the southeast and the Y oruba Nation in the southwest  highlighted the worsening 
divisions and tensions  in the country, to which the authorities sometimes re-
sponded with exce ssive u se of force. IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu was arrested 
abroad and brought to stand trial in Nigeria for charge s including treason and 
terrorism. The authoritie s have not revealed wher e and how he was arrested, 
amid questions about the legitimacy of his arrest as his representatives claim he was abducted in Kenya. Kanu was previously arrested and  charged  in 2015. He 
fled the country in 2017 after he was r eleased on bail. 
Abuses by Armed Islamists in the Northeast  
In March, suspected ISWAP fighters attacked  a United Nations base and humani-
tarian hub in the Dikwa Local Go vernment Area of Borno State, burning aid work-
500WORLD REPORT 2022ers’ offices, destroying government facilities and hospitals, and abducting at 
least seven humanitarian workers . In a series of attac ks in April, suspected 
ISWAP fighters set ablaze the facilities of  three international aid organizations in 
Damasak town in Borno State. Eight people were killed, over a dozen were in-
jured, and about 65,000 people were displaced.  The UN suspended humanitar-
ian operations in these ar eas to ensur e safety of h umanitarian staff.  
The Borno State governor continued to reloc ate internally displaced persons 
from camps in the state capital, Maiduguri, to volatile areas, despite security 
concerns raised by humanitarian act ors. In August, 11 civilians we re killed, and 
several others injured during clashes betw een suspected ISWAP fighters and se-
curity forces in Ajiri Local Government Area of Borno State. Ajiri is one of the first locations to which internally displaced people were 
returned in 2020 . The au-
thorities also relocated mor e people to Ajiri in August just days before the 
deadly clashes there.  
Accountability for Serious Crimes 
In December 2020, the chief prosecutor of the ICC announced that the Boko 
Haram- related conflict in the northeast warr anted a full ICC investigation after 
finding “reasonab le basis to believe” that  the group and  its breaka way f actions, 
as well as Nigerian security forces, had c ommitted war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. 
The ICC reached this conclusion after c onsidering the lack of progress on efforts 
to investigate and p rosecute these crimes nation ally. In response, Nigeria’s in-
formation minister accused the ICC of having “colluded” with civil society groups  
to “exacerbate” Nigeria’s security challenge s, using threats of prosecution to de-
moralize security forces.  
Trials for hundreds of Boko Haram suspects have been repeatedly postponed 
since 2019, and those that took place in the two preceding years were fraught with irregularities. Most of the charge s against the more than 200 defendants in 
the flawed 
July 2018 trials  were based on alleged confessions and involved 
vague accusations of supporting Boko Haram by repairing members’ vehicles, 
laundering their clothes, or supplying them with food and other items. Some of 
the defendants arrested in 2019 are still in being detained.  
501HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry in vestigating the shooting of #EndSARS pro-
testers by military officers at the Lekki To ll Gate in Lagos held its final hearing on 
October 19. Its final report and recommendations have not been made public. Recommendations from the panel have no force of law except that they are adopted by the Lagos State Governor, aft er which they can be enforced as a 
judgment of the State High Court. Courts cannot however automatically assume jurisdiction over police and military offic ers. Charges can only be brought 
against them after internal disciplinary processes lead to their being fired.  
Military officers who were at the scene during the Lekki Toll Gate shooting on Oc-
tober 20, 2020, refused to appear befor e the panel. A military representative 
told the panel 
that officers at the scene only shot blank bullets after they were 
attacked by “hoodlums”  who pelted them with stones and injured a soldier on 
the lip. The military had initially denied claims  that officers shot at protesters. 
Human Rights Watch found that at least 15 people lost consciousness and ap-peared dead after the shootings at the Le kki Toll Gate; 10 of these bodies were 
then taken away from the scene by military officers.  
Freedom of Expression, Media, and Association  
After the Twitter b an was announced in Ju ne, the Nigerian Commu nications Com-
mission (NCC), the telecommunications regulato r, directed to suspend access to 
Twitter. Nigerians responded by using virtual private networks (VPNs)  to circum-
vent the ban. The justice minister announced that those circumventing the ban 
will be prosecuted  but this has yet to  happen. 
On June 22, the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS)  ordered the Nigerian authorities to refrain from imposing sanc-
tions, ha rass ing, arresting, or prosecuting those using Twitter in Nigeria. The pre-
liminary order was granted pending the determination of  a case br ought against 
the Nigerian government  by a group of civil society groups  challenging the Twit-
ter ban. Hearing of the substantive case is still ongoing. 
Despite repeated claims by the authorities  that the ban would soon be lifted, the 
platform remained inaccessible through local internet service providers at time of writing.  
502WORLD REPORT 2022In July, Nigerian media organizations launched a campaign  against controversial 
media bills being considered at the national assembly aimed at bringing internet broadcasting under the control of the feder al government’s broadcast regulator 
and empowering the president to appoint officials of the board of the Nigerian Press Council, which ensures the profess ional standards of the press, upon the 
recommendation of the information minister. 
Later that month, Nigeria’s broadcasting authority asked broadcast stations to 
stop reporting details of insecurity issues or 
details of victims  so as not to jeop-
ardize the efforts of the Nigerian military and other security agents.  
Security forces continued to disrupt #EndSARS related gatherings and protests. 
In February, police officers arrested people protesting a decis ion to reopen the 
Lekki Toll Gate  in Lagos where military officer s opened fire during the protests 
against police brutality in 2020. Following the arrests, a video surfaced  showing 
over a dozen arrested protesters tightly packed together in a small yellow bus with their hands tied behind their backs in a position which appeared similar to 
a torture style known as ‘tabay.’ 
Tabay is a form of punishment used by the 
Nigerian security forces  in which a person’s elbows are tied together behind his 
back, and the rope is pulled tighter and tighter until their rib cage separates. 
In response to this, the Lagos State police authorities issued a statement de-
nouncing the treatment of proteste rs and announcing an investigation  to ensure 
officers responsible are held accountable. The authorities have yet to provide further information on the investigation. The 
protesters were charged  with 
crimes including conduct likely to cause a breach of peace and violation of 
Covid-19 protocols and later granted bail. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
In July, five men accused of homosexuality  were arrested in Kano State by the 
state Hisbah Board, a religiou s police unit that enfor ces Sharia (Islamic law). 
Kano is among 10 Nigerian states that practice Sharia alongside Nigerian secular law. Both laws criminalize same-sex relations. If the men are found guilty under Nigerian law, they may face up to 14 years in prison. If found guilty under Sharia, they may face the death penalty.  
503HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHChildren 
Schools were open in 2021 following extended closures in 2020 to control the 
spread of Covid-19. Befor e the pandemic, an estimated 10.5 million children  
were out of school, although primary education is supposedly free and compul-sory. Succe ssive k idnappings of school children in northern parts of the country 
have also seriously impacted education. Girl s who are not in sc hool are often 
married off at an early age and the 
varied adoption or lack of legislation  against 
child marriage presents opportunities for families to forc e their daughters into 
early marriage. In October, the Nigerian government hosted the fourth interna-
tional Safe Schools Conference , which aimed to galvanize action on protecting 
education from attack.  
Key International Actors  
In August, Nigeria received the first 6 of 12 “Super Tucano” light attack aircrafts sold by the United States government. The sale is the largest foreign military 
sales program in Sub-Saharan Africa by the US, valued at almost US$500 mil-lion. It was approved by the Trump adminis tration in 2017 after the Obama ad-
ministration held up the deal due to human rights concerns. In July 2021, US lawmakers 
paused another proposed sale of 12 AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters 
and accompanying defense syst ems to the Nigerian military , worth about $875 
million, citing human rights concerns.  
In August, Nigeria and Russia signed a military cooperation deal  which provides 
a legal framework for the supply of equipment and the training of troops in Nige-ria.  
Foreign Policy 
Nigeria condemned the October military coup in Sudan  and called on those be-
hind it to urgently restore constit utional order. Nigerian authorities previously 
condemned  the military coup in Guinea in September  and Mali in May.  
During his address at the UN General Assembly , President Muhammadu Buhari 
pledged his support to the efforts of ECOWAS to address the trend of coups in West Africa and called on leaders to adhere to their countries’ constitutional 
term limits, noting that failure to do so generates crises and political tensions. 
504WORLD REPORT 2022North Korea 
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) remains one of the most re-
pressive coun tries in the world. Ruled by the authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un, 
the government responded to international challenges and the Covid-19 pan-demic in 2021 with deepened isolation and repression, and maintained fearful obedience in the population through threats of execution, imprisonment, en-forced disappearances, and forced hard labor in detention and prison camps.  
In 2021, the North Korea government extended 
extreme and unnecessary meas-
ures under the pretext of protecting against the spread of Covid-19  by closing its 
borders, and tightly restricting domestic travel as well as distribution of food and other products within the country.  
The government does not tolerate pluralism, b ans independent medi a, civil soci-
ety organizations, and trade unions, and systematically denies all basic liber-ties, including freedom of expression, public assembly, association, and religion. Fear of collective punishment is used to silence dissent. Authorities in North Korea routinely send perceived opponents of the government to secretive political prison camps ( kwanliso ) in remote regions where they face torture by 
guards, starvation rations, and forced labor.  
The government systematically extracts forced, unpaid labor from its citizens to 
build infrastructure and conduct other government-ordered campaigns and pub-
lic work projects. The government fails to protect the rights of numerous at-risk 
groups, including women, children, and people with disabilities. 
North Korea has taken no meaningful steps to advance economic, social and cul-
tural rights. When the impact of  the almost two -year -long Covid-19 loc kdown in-
tensified as the countr y was hit by major 
droughts  in July, followed by flooding  in 
August, Kim Jong Un in September acknowledged  North Korea’s dire economic 
and food situation and called for self-reliance and “unspecified”  tightened 
measures agains t Covid-19, ev en though the country was repor ting zero po sitive 
cases of Covid-19. Meanwhile, the government continued to prioritize weapons development, conducting 
missile tests  in March, September, and October.   
505HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFreedom of Movement  
Moving from one province to another, or traveling abroad, without prior approval 
remains illegal in North Korea. The government continues to strictly enforce a ban on “illegal” travel to China. Border buffer zones set up in August 2020, 
which extend one to two kilometers from the northern border, operated continu-
ously in 2021 with guards ordered to 
“unconditionally shoot”  on sight anyone 
entering without  permiss ion. There were reports  of border guards shooting dead 
North Koreans trying to cross the border.  
During the year, the government banned nearly all international travel,  sus-
pended all international flights, and closed down its official land border cross-ings with China. The government also imposed extreme measures on resident diplomats and international organization work ers. It prohibited travel outside of 
Pyongyang and stopped the 
receipt of diplomatic pouches . Diplomatic  missions, 
United Nations agencies, and international  nongovernmental organizations were 
permitted to repatriate staff but were unable to bring staff back  into the country. 
The DPRK also implemented  quarantines of over a month  for all reentry into the 
country. These measures led almost all diplomats to leave  the country, along with all 
UN and nongovernmental organization (NGO) aid workers.   
The government also enhanced restrictions on domestic travel  because of Covid-
19, granting permits to travel only for movement of essential personnel and goods. Authorities increased road checkpoints, blocked inter-district move-
ments, and enhanced enforcement to prev ent “illegal” travel. These measures 
severely hurt people’s livelihoods and their ability to access food, medicines, 
and other essential goods.  
Activist networks in China and South Kore a that help North Kore ans flee to a safe 
third country said they faced major obst acles because increased  numbers of ran-
dom checks on roads, and surveillance. Many North Koreans in China remained hidden in safe houses for months as the Chinese government sought to detain 
North Korean refugees and return them to the DPRK, violating China’s obliga-tions as a stat e that has r atified the UN Refugee Conv ention. North Koreans flee-
ing into China should be recognized and  protected as refugees sur place 
because of the certainty of persecution on return. China 
forcibly returned a group 
of nearly 50 North Koreans  to the DPRK in July.   
506WORLD REPORT 2022North Korean law sta tes that leaving the countr y without perm ission is a crime of 
“treachery against the nation, ” punishable by death. The 2014 UN  Commission 
of Inquiry (COI ) on human rights in the DPRK found Pyongyang committed crimes 
against humanity against those forcibly returned by China to North Korea.  
Very few North Koreans are escaping the country. Just over 1,000 North Koreans 
fled to the south in 2019, but only 229 escaped in 2020. Between January and September 2021, only 48 North Koreans successfully reached South Korea where their rights are protected.    
Freedom of Expression and Information  
The North Korean government does not respect the rights to freedom of thought, opinion, expression or information. All media is strictly controlled. Accessing 
phones, computers, televis ions, radios or media content th at are not  sanctioned 
by the government is illegal, and considered “anti-socialist behavior” to be se-verely punished. The government regu larly cracks down on unsanctioned media 
consumption. It also jams Chinese m obile phone services at the northern bor-
der, and arrests those communicating with people outside of the country, or con-necting outsiders to people inside the country.  
The North Korean government 
adopted  the “DPRK Law on rejecting reactionary 
ideology and culture” in December 2020. The law bans people from distributing 
media originating from South Korea, the US, or Japan, and sets out punishments up to the death penalty. Simply watching su ch media content can result in a sen-
tence of 15 years in an ordinary crimes prison camp ( kyohwaso ). Under the law, 
speaking, writing, or singing in South Korean style  can be punished with two 
years of hard labor. In April 2021, Kim Jong Un published a letter about “danger-
ous poisons ,” setting out his policy to stop young North Koreans from adopting 
foreign speech, hairs tyles, and clothes.  
The law also criminalizes possession of  unsanctioned foreign mobile phones, 
setting out penalties of three months or more of forced labor. Media with con-tacts inside North Korea reported increased inspections and crackdowns on stu-dent text messages that contain South Korean slang, 
mass arrests of users of 
foreign cell phones , and a propaganda campaign  depicting foreign phone users 
as “evil” enemies of the state who m ust be reported to the authorities. 
507HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHForced Labor  
The North Korean government routinely and systematically requires forced labor 
from much of its population to sustain its economy. The government’s forced labor demands target women and children through the Women’s Union or 
schools; workers at st ate-owned enterprise s or deployed abroad; detainees in 
short-term hard labor detention centers ( rodong dallyeondae ); and prisoners at 
long-term ordinary prison camps ( kyohwaso ) and political prison camps ( kwan-
liso).  
At some point in their lives, a significant majority of North Koreans must perform 
unpaid hard labor, often justified by the state as “portrayals of loyalty” to the government. Since 
punishment for crimes in North Korea is arbitrary,  and de-
pends on a person’s record of loyalty, personal connections, and capacity to pay bribes, any refusal of a government order to work as a “volunteer” can result in 
severe punishment, including torture and imprisonment. 
The government routinely compels North Koreans to join paramilitary labor 
brigades ( dolgyeokdae ) that the ruling party controls and operates, working pri-
marily on buildings and infrastructure projects. In theory, these workers are enti-
tled to a salary worth around three to five kilograms of rice a month, but in almost all cases, the  dolyeokdae,  like most state-owned enterprises, do not fi-
nancially compensate their workers. This forces workers to find other jobs to sur-vive while paying bribes not  to go to their offic ially assigned workplace. Failing 
to show up for work without perm ission is a crime punishable by three to  six 
months of unpaid hard labor in detention centers ( rodong dallyeondae ).  
North Korea remains one of only seven United Nations member states that has 
not joined the International Labour Organization.  
Marginalized Groups and Women and Girls  
North Korea uses songbun , a socio-political  classific ation system that  groups 
people into “loyal,” “w avering,” or “hostile” classes, and is used to justify politi-
cally determined discrimination in emplo yment, residence, and schooling. Per-
vasive c orruption allows  some maneuv ering around the strictures  of the 
songbun  system, with government officials accepting bribes to grant permis-
sions, permit certain market activities, or avoid possible punishments. 
508WORLD REPORT 2022In addition to the violations suffered by the general population, women and girls 
in North Korea are the target of a range of  sexual and gender-based abuses. Gov-
ernment officials both perpetrate and fail to effectively respond to rights viola-tions including widespread gender discrimination, sexual and gender-based violence, and constant exposure to stereotyped gender roles.  
Key International Actors  
North Korea has r atified five core human rights treaties, but the government  has 
made no apparent effort to implement these treaties or otherwise demonstrate 
respect for human right. A 2014 COI  report found the government committed 
crimes against humanity, including extermin ation, murder, enslavement, torture, 
imprisonment, and rape, forced abortion, and other forms of sexual violence. It recommended the UN Security Council refer the situation to the International Criminal  Court. The North Korean government  has repeat edly denied the COI’s 
findings and refuses to cooperate with the Seoul-based Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights or the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea.  
On March 23, 2021, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a 
reso-
lution  extending its accountability efforts and mechanisms. In November, the UN 
General Assembly’s third committee passed a resolution by consensus con-demning human rights in North Korea. 
Every year from 2014 to 2017 , the UN Security Council placed North Korea’s 
human rights violations on its formal agenda and held open meetings on how the violations threaten international peace and  security. However, this effort fal-
tered for three years in a row during the US Trump administration. The US govern-ment currently imposes human rights-r elated sanctions on North Korean 
government entities, as well as on Kim Jong Un and on several other top officials. 
Despite North Korea’s rejection of any diplomatic engagement, South Korean 
President Moon Jae-in’s administration continued to seek political dialogue with Pyongyang in 2021. The South Korean gov ernment has not adopted a cl ear policy 
on North Korean hum an rights issues. Since 20 19, it has declined to co-sponsor 
key resolutions on North Korea’s human rights record at the UN Human Rights Council or the General Assembly.
509HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPakistan 
In 2021, the Pakistan government intensified its efforts to control the media and 
curtail dissent. Authoritie s harassed, and at times detained, journ alists and 
other members of civil society  for criticiz ing government officials and policies. Vi-
olent attacks on members of the media also continued. 
The authorities expanded their use of drac onian sedition and counterterrorism 
laws to stifle d issent, and st rictly regulated civil society groups c ritical of govern-
ment actions or policies. Authorities also cra cked down on members and sup-
porters of opposition political parties. 
Women, religious minorities, and transgender people continue to face violence, 
discrimination, and persecution, with authoritie s failing to provide adequate 
protection or hold perpetrators to acco unt. The government continues to do little 
to hold law enforcement agencies a ccountable for torture and other serious 
abuses.  
Attacks by Islamist militants, notably the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, targeting law 
enforcement officials and religious minoritie s killed dozens of people. 
Freedom of Expression, Attacks on Civil Society Groups 
A climate of fear impedes media cover age of abuses by both government secu-
rity forces and militant groups. Journalists who face threats and attacks have in-creasingly resorted to self-censorship. Media outlets have come under pressure from authorities not to criticize government institutions or the judiciary. In sev-eral cases in 2021, government regulato ry agencies blocked cable operators and 
television channels that had aired critical programs. 
Several journalists suffered violent attacks in 2021. On 
April 20 , an unidentified 
assailant shot  and wounded  Absar Alam, a television journ alist, outs ide his 
house in Islamabad.  Alam has been a prominent c ritic of the 
government. On  May 25 , Asad Ali Toor, a journalist, was assaulted by three 
unidentified men who forcibly entered his apartment in Islamabad, bound and gagged him and severely beat him. Toor said that they identified themselves as being from a security agency, int errogated him about the “source of his funds,” 
510WORLD REPORT 2022and took away his cell phone and other electronic devices. The 
government  ordered  an investigation into the incident, but no findings were 
made public. On May 29 , the news channel, Geo, “suspended” Hamid Mir, one 
of Pakistan’s b est-known television talk show hosts, after he sp oke at a protest 
in solidarity with Toor.  
Nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs) reported intimid ation, ha rass ment, and 
surveillance of various by gov ernment authorities. The government used the 
“Regulation of INGOs in Pakistan ” policy to impede the registration and func-
tioning of international humanitarian and human rights groups. 
Freedom of Religion and Belief 
Members of the Ahmadiyya religious community continue to be a major target for prosecutions u nder blasp hemy laws as well as spec ific anti-Ahm adi laws. Mili-
tant groups and the Islamist political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) 
accuse  Ah-
madis of “posing as Muslims.” The Pakistan penal code also treats “posing as Muslims” as a criminal offense. 
According to a Pakistani human rights organization, the 
Centre for Social Justice,  
at least 1,855 people were char ged under Pa kistan’s blasphem y laws between 
1987 and February 2021. 
On May 17 , dozens of people attacked a polic e station in Islamabad to lynch two 
brothers charged w ith blasphemy, brea king into the facility  and b attling with po-
lice officers before the st ation was br ought under cont rol. The two brothers were 
physically unharmed. The police arrested a number of individuals who were part of the mob, but none were prosecuted. 
On 
June 4 , the Lahore High Court acquitted a Christian couple, Shafqat Em-
manuel and  Shagufta Kausar, of  blasphemy aft er spending sev en years on death 
row. The couple was convicted in 2014 of sending “ blasphemous” te xts to a 
mosque cleric. 
In August , an 8 -year-old Hindu boy in Rahim Yar Kh an, Punja b, became the 
youngest person to ever be charged  with blasphemy in Pa kistan after he was ac-
cused of defiling a carpet at a religious semin ary. Following his release on bail, a 
511HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmob attacked a Hindu temple, causing da mage. All charges against the child 
were subsequently dropped .  
Abuses against Women and Girls  
Violence against women and  girls—including rape, murder, acid attacks, domes-
tic violence, and forced marriage—is endemic throughout Pakistan. Human rights defenders 
estimate  that roughly 1,000 women are killed in so-called honor 
killings every year. 
In July, the torture and murder of Noor Muqadam, 27 , in Islamabad led to nation-
wide protests. A childhood friend of  Muqadam, Zahir Jaffer , whose marriage pro-
posal she had spurned , was arrested and charged w ith the murder. Earlier in 
July, Pakistan’s P arliament did not pass a bill th at sought to c riminalize dom estic 
violence; women rights activists c riticized  the gov ernment’s de cision to re fer the 
bill to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) for review. The CII criticized  the 
bill saying that it contained “un-Islamic injunctions” and would destroy the insti-tution of the family. 
In 
August , a viral video of a young woman being assaulted by more than 400 
men in a Lahore park while she and her c ompanions were filming a TikTok video 
led to domestic and international condemnation. The government vowed to find the perpetrators, but no arrests were made public. 
Child marriage  remains a serious problem in Pakistan, with 18 percent of girls 
marrying before age 18, and 4 percent  marrying before 15. Women from religious 
minority communities remain particularly vulnerable to  forced marriage . The gov-
ernment has done little to stop such marriages. 
Pakistan ranked 153 out of 156 nations on the  Global Gender Gap 2021  index is-
sued by the World Economic Forum. 
Children’s Rights to Education 
Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, over 5 million primary schoo l-age children 
in Pakistan were out of school, most of them girls. Human Rights Watch research found girls m iss school for rea sons including lack of schools, costs associated 
with studying, child marriage, harmful child labor, and gender discrimination. School closures to protect against the spre ad of Covid-19 affected almost 45 mil-
512WORLD REPORT 2022lion students for most of the year; Pakistan’s poor internet connectivity ham-
pered online learning. 
Police and Security Forces Abuses 
The Tehrik-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), A l-Qaeda, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), 
and their affiliates carried out suic ide bombings and other indiscriminate at-
tacks against security  personnel that  caused hundr eds of civi lian deaths and in-
juries during the year. In July, an attack on a bus carrying workers at the Dasu 
Hydroelectric  project in Kh yber-Pakh tunkhwa kil led nine Chinese engineers. In 
August,  a grenade attack in Karachi ki lled 12 people, including six women and 
children. No group claimed responsibility for either incident. 
Pakistan law enforcement agencies were responsible  for numerous human rights 
violations, including detention without charge and extrajudicial killings. In 
March , Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan met with families of people who had 
been forcibly disappeared, allegedly by Pakistani security forces, and pledged that their concerns would be addressed. However, his government announced no investigations in any cases. 
Pakistan has still not enacted  a law crimin alizing tortur e despite Pakis tan’s obli-
gation to do so under the UN Convention against Torture. In 
July, the Pakistan 
Senate unanimously approved a critically important bill outlawing police torture and otherwise seeking to prevent deaths in police custody. The law had not been passed by the National Assembly at time of writing. The law if passed would be the first time that  Pakistan enacts a comprehen sive definition of tor ture in line 
with Convention Against Torture. The bill al so proposes criminal liability for 
death caused in police custody, 
Pakistan has more than 
4,600   prisoners on death row, one of the world’s largest 
populations facing execution. Those on death row are often from the most mar-ginalized sections of society. 
In June, the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) retained Pak-
istan as a jurisdiction under “Increased Monitoring”–a so-called gray list of countries that fall short of FATF stand ards for countering terrorism financing and 
money laundering. Pakistan has been on the gray li st since 2018. The FATF  noted 
that Pakistan had made progress by largely  addressing 26 of 27 goals, but still 
513HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHneeded to show that its investigations into terrorism financ ing and prosecutions 
“target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups 
In October, Pakistan’s Senate approved a bill that would decriminalize suicide; 
parliamentary approval was still pending at time of writing. Di sability rights and 
mental health advocates welcomed the move as an important first step.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
Pakistan’s penal code criminalizes same-sex sexual conduct, placing men who have sex with men and transgender people at risk of police abuse and other vio-lence and discrimination. In 
July, act ivists cl aimed that  the transgender commu-
nity in Karachi was being targeted in an organized  social media campaign to 
instigate violence against its members. On April 6 , a 60 -year-ol d transgender 
resident of Karac hi’s Korangi neigh borhood was shot and ki lled by unidentified 
assailants who broke into their home. 
Key International Actors  
The European Union is Pakistan biggest trading partner. In April , the European 
Parliament passed a resolution deploring human rights violations in Pakistan and calling for an immediate review of Pa kistan’s eligibility for GSP+ status, 
which grants Pakistan trade benefits conditional on its compliance with human rights obligations. In 
June , the EU and Pakistan held human rights talks . The 
EU’s report on Pakistan’s compliance with its human rights obligations to retain GSP+ status is scheduled to be published in early 2022.  
In 
April , a ruling party member tabled a resolution in the National Assembly de-
manding a debate on whether to expel the French ambassador for “anti-Islamic” 
remarks made by President Emmanuel Macron. 
In April , Pakistan secured membership on three United Nations panels: the Com-
mission on Crime Prev ention and Crimin al Justice, the Comm ission on the St atus 
of Women, and the Commiss ion on Population and Development. 
Pakistan’s relationship with United States, the country’s largest development 
and military donor, remained volatile in 2021. The United States acknowledged 
Pakistan’s significant role as one of the stakeholders in resolving the Afghanistan conflict. However, in September , US Secretary of State Antony 
514WORLD REPORT 2022Blinken said  that the Unit ed States would reassess its rel ationship with Pakistan 
in formulating a policy on the future of Af ghanistan. He also called on Pakistan 
not to recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan unless it meets interna-
tional demands.  Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said  Blinken’s remarks 
were “not in line with the close cooperation” between the two countries. 
After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August, Pakistan signaled that it 
was prepared to  recognize the T aliban government. 
Pakistan and China deepened their exten sive economic and po litical ties  in 
2021, and work continued on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a project consisting of construction of roads, railways, and energy pipelines. In 
October , 
Pakistan carried out joint counterterrorism military exercises with China. 
515HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPapua New Guinea 
Although a resource-rich country, almost 40 percent  of Papua New Guinea’s 
(PNG) population lives in poverty. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted ongoing challenges with government inaction, economic mismanagement, and a severely under-resourced health care system. Before Covid-19 started spreading, PNG was already struggling with 
outbreaks  of measles, drug-resistant tuberculosis , 
and polio with poor vaccination rates . Weak implementation of laws on violence 
against women and children foster a cul ture of impunity. Prime Minister James 
Marape has c ommitted to ref orms to address gender-based  violence, but real 
progress has ye t to be seen. 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights 
Violence against women and  girls is rampant. Over 1.5 million people  experience 
gender-based violence each year.  
In May , a Special Parliamentary Committee examined measures to prevent vio-
lence against women and girls. The inquiry found a lack of support, funding, and coordination from the government contribu ted to an inadequate response to the 
high volume of cases of vio lence against women and girls.  
In 2020, approximately 
15,000 cases  of domestic violence were reported, but 
only 300 people  were prosecuted, and 100 people  were convicted. Police offi-
cials admitted at the inquiry that the polic e force cannot currently keep women 
and children safe and lack re sources for thorough investigations. 
PNG laws designed to protect women and children, including the Lukautim 
Pikinini (Child Welfare) Act 2015 and the Family Protection Act 2013, are rarely 
enforced. Initiatives such as Family Se xual and Violence Units within the police 
force remain limited. A lack of services for survivors  of gender-ba sed violence 
compounds the problem. 
In 2021, instances of domestic violence continued to spark outrage. In May, the 
body of a 31-year-old woman , Imelda Tupi Tiamand a, was found  wrapped in tar-
paulin in her husband’s vehicle at a police checkpoint. Police arrested and 
charged three men, including her husband . In September, the three men were 
516WORLD REPORT 2022released  from prison and the magistrate dismissed  the charges citing a lack of 
evidence.  
Between May and June, five women  were violently attacked following accusa-
tions of pr acticing “sorcery,” one of  whom was kil led. In May , attackers accused  
Mary Kopari of sorcery and tied her up and burned her to death in Komo-Maga-rima Dist rict. The attack was filmed  and while police kno w the identity of  some of 
the attackers, no arrests have been reported. 
PNG has one of the 
highest maternal mortality rates  in the world. More than 
2,000  women and girls die in childbirth in PNG each year. These deaths are 
largely preventable . The risk of maternal death is increased by limited access to 
hospitals, with 80 percent  of the population living outside urban centers.  
Children’s Rights to Health and Education  
One in 13 children  die each year of preventable disease. Children living in rural 
areas are twice  as likely to die in their first five yea rs of life compared to children 
living in urban areas. Covid-19 has put chil d health outcomes at risk due to inter-
rupted vaccination and other health programs. 
In March, 2.1 million children were affect ed by a four-week school closure. Be-
fore the pandemic,  7 percent  of children—over  86,000 children —were out of 
primary, and 14 percent were out of lower-secondar y school, becau se of barriers 
to access including remoteness, gender inequality, and a lack of learning re-sources. 
 
Police Abuse  
Police violence, including against ch ildren, is an ongoing problem in PNG. In 
April, police entered the residence of lawyer Laken Lepatu Aigilo without  an ar-
rest or search warrant  and assaulted  him before detaining him. PNG Police Min-
ister David Manning ordered  his release the following day. Police authorities 
conducted an internal investigation  into the incident and police confirmed with 
Human Rights Watch that the officer invo lved was arreste d, suspended, and that 
the matter was befor e the crimin al court.  
517HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPNG police are severely understaffed, chronically underfunded, and often lack 
resources  such as petrol, stationery, and vehicles. 
Asylum Seekers and Refugees  
At time of writing, about 124 refugees and asylum seekers remained in Papua 
New Guinea, transferred there by the Austr alian government since 2013. In Octo-
ber, Australia said  it would end offshore processing in the country by December 
2021 and those who remained in PNG could stay there or be transferred to Nauru or giving them the option to remain in PNG with a promise of a “permanent mi-gration pathway.”  In April, attackers 
robbed and assaulted  around 15 asylum 
seekers at gunpoint. At least three required medical attention.  
Refugees and asylu m seekers in PNG continue to endu re violence and harass-
ment, with little protection from authorities. Medic al facilities in PNG are woe-
fully inadequate and have proven unable to cope with the complex medical needs of asylum seekers and refugees, particularly their mental health needs. 
Land and Environmental Rights  
In July, Australian mining company Rio Tinto agreed  to fund an independent as-
sessment of the human rights and envi ronmental impacts following the closure 
of its Panguna copper and gold mine in the autonomous region of Bougainville. 
One hundred and fifty-six Bougainville residents  petitioned the Australian gov-
ernment in 2020 to investigate Rio Tinto’s  involvement in human rights abuses. 
Petitioners said that polluted water fr om the mine pit flowed into rivers and pol-
luted fields.  
In 2020, the PNG government refused  an application to extend the Porgera gold 
mine lease in Enga Province with Prime Minister Marape citing  long standing en-
vironmental and resettlement issues. In Apri l of that year, the PNG government 
and local Porgera landholders took a ma jority share of the Porgera gold mine in 
Enga province, with the remainder held by joint venture partners Canadian com-pany Barrick Gold and Chinese comp any Zijin Mining Group. At time of writing, 
the mine had been closed for over a year, with negotiations continuing between the parties.  
518WORLD REPORT 2022In March, a report  by Jubilee Australia Research Centre and Project Sepik de-
tailed environmental and social risks associated with a proposed gold, copper, 
and silver mine to be built on the Frieda River in the Sepik region. The mine, if approved, would be the largest in PNG’s history.  
While contributing very little to  global emissions that are driving the c limate cri-
sis, coastal and island communities in PNG are facing serious climate impacts as 
sea-level rise and coastal erosion limit access to food and water and force resi-dents to relocate. Carter ets Islanders, some of the world’s first communities dis-
placed by the effects of climate change, have  said that more than 50 percent of 
their land has already been lost due to se a level rise.  
PNG is also working to reduce its own emiss ions. Deforestation and  forest degra-
dation dr ive a s ignificant portion of the countr y’s emiss ions, and PNG has com-
mitted to reduc ing em issions from these sources by 2030. Howe ver, PNG has 
increased  export of harvested timber in recent years and struggles to contain 
regulation and enforcement , and a failure  to respect local land rights .  
Disability Rights  
Approximately 1.2 million peop le in PNG are living with a disability according to 
the World Health Organization. Despite the existence of a national disability pol-
icy, PNG has yet to  pass c omprehen sive disa bility legi slation.  
People with disabilities are often unable to  participate in community life, attend 
school, or work because of lack of accessibility, stigma, and other barriers. Ac-
cess to mental health services and other support services are limited, and many people with psychosocial disabilities and their families often consider tradi-
tional healers to  be their only option. Co vid-19 has dispr oportionately affected 
people with disabilities who are left out of government Covid-19 policies and 
communications . 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Same-sex relations are still punishable by up to 14 years of imprisonment  in 
PNG’s criminal code. While there is little information on actual convictions, the law is sometimes used  as a pretext by officials and employers to harass or extort 
519HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmoney from gay and lesbian peop le in Papua New Guinea, including gay 
refugees. 
Covid-19  
According to the PNG government’s National Control Centre, as of November, 
more than 34,000 people had tested positive for Covid-19, and more than 520 
people had died; inadequate testing means that the actual number of cases is likely far higher. Vaccination rates are extremely low  with only 
3 percent  of the 
population vaccinated as of November. As of November, only about 770,000 vac-cine doses had been delivered to the country—enough to vaccinate approxi-mately 6 percent of the population, according to UNICEF. Over 
130,000 vaccines  
delivered by the global facility COVAX expired before they could be administered.  
Key International Actors  
Australia is the biggest provider  of aid and investment to PNG, and at time of 
writing had given Covid-19 support including 8,000  vaccine doses, 200,000  face 
masks, and 1 million  surgical masks in 2021. 
In 2021, Australia committed  to refinancing an existing AUD$410 million loan  
(US$300 million), and to provide a further AUD$130 million loan  (US$100 million 
loan) to assist PNG to continue the del ivery of co re government services. Aus-
tralia’s official development commitment to PNG during 2020 and 2021 is around 
AUD$600 million  (US$430 million).  
It is estimated that Austr alia has s pent AUD$268 mi llion (US$200 mil lion) on off-
shore processing in PNG in 201 9-2020, and approximately AUD$1.6 billion  
(US$1.2 billion) since the PNG Supreme Court ru led that Australia’s detention of 
asylum seekers there was illegal in 2016.  
China also provides significant development and economic support to PNG. In 
June, PNG’s Foreign Minister Soroi Eoe visited China and signed a US$22 million  
loan to support the creation of a ‘special economic zone’ in Kikori, in the Gulf of PNG. Later that month, the Chinese government provided PNG with 
200,000  
doses of Covid-19 vaccine. 
520WORLD REPORT 2022In November, at the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review of 
PNG, countries urged  the PNG government to improve gender-based violence, 
LGBT rights, and access to education for all children, including children with a 
disability. Fifteen nations questioned PNG’s retention of the death penalty and called for its abolition.  
521HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHPeru 
On June 6, Peruvians elected Pedro Castillo as president in what international 
observers described as free and fair elections. Castillo’s opponent, Keiko Fuji-mori, made unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and sought to have the elec-tions annulled through litigation and political  pressure. Fujimori’s appeals were 
dismissed, and Peruvian electoral authoritie s proclaimed Castillo president on 
July 19.  
Criminal inv estigations int o grave abus es committed during the 20 -year internal 
armed conflict that ended in 2000 remain slow and limited. Violence against women, abuses by security forces, and thr eats to freedom of expression are also 
major concerns. 
Covid-19 and measures imposed to prevent its spread have had a devastating 
impact on poverty and inequality, negatively impacting social and economic rights. 
Right to Vote and Run for Office 
International observers, including from the Organization of American States and 
the European Union, described Peru’s June 6 presidential runoff elections as free and fair.  
When rapid-count results indicated Castillo had won, Fujimori alleged voter 
fraud and filed hundreds of baseless lawsuits seeking to annul hundreds of 
thousands of ballots cast by mostly poor and rural Castillo voters. Keiko Fujimori and her party, Fuerza Popular, failed to provide credible evidence to support their claims. 
Members of the JNE and other authorities repeatedly endured intimidation ef-
forts during the electoral campaigns and vo te counting process. In July, the Inter-
American Comm ission on Hum an Rights (IACHR) issued prec autionary m easures 
in favor of JNE  President Jorge Luis Salas Arenas and Jo sé Domingo Pérez, a pros-
ecutor overseeing high-profile corruption cases, including against Keiko Fuji-
mori.  
522WORLD REPORT 2022As votes were being counted, several political parties, including Fujimori’s 
Fuerza Popular, sped up a process to  appoint six judges to the Constitutional Tri-
bunal outside the regular session of Cong ress and without complying with legal 
standards, a move that many described  as an attempt to pack the high court in 
preparation for seeking judicial annulment of the election, amongst other objec-tives. In July, a court granted a pro visional measure ordering Congress to sus-
pend the selection. Many lawmakers announced they would not comply with the ruling, but they were unable to gather the majority needed to appoint new judges. 
Confronting Past Abuses 
Efforts to prosecute grave abuses committed during the armed conflict have had mixed results. 
Almost 70,000 people were killed or subject to enforced disappearance by the 
Shining Path, other armed groups, or state agents, during an armed conflict last-ing from 1980 to 2000 , Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation C ommiss ion estimates. 
The vast majority of those killed were low-income peasants; most spoke Indige-nous languages.  
Authorities have made slow progress in prosecuting abuses by government 
forces during the conflict. As of September 2021, courts had issued 48 convic-tions in 90 cases, Peruvian human rights groups reported. 
Former President  Alberto Fujimori was sent enced in 2009 to 25  years in prison 
on charges of crimes against humanity , in connection with kidnappings and two 
massacres, and v arious corruption-r elated offenses.  
In March, prosecutors indicted Fujimori and three former health ministers on 
charges related to the forced st erilizations of mostly poor and Indigenous 
women during his presidency. The case remains pending. As of June 2021, 6,103 people had registered as victims of these forced sterilizations, the Ministry of Women reported. 
At time of writing, criminal investigations continued into the role of former Presi-
dent Ollanta Humala (2011-2016) in killings and other atrocities committed in 1992 and in their co ver-up. 
523HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn 2018, then-President Martín Vizcarra established a genetic profile bank to 
help search for those disappeared during the armed conflict. Implementation has been sluggish.  
Abuses by Armed Groups  
A Shining Path offshoot known as the Militarized Communist Party of Peru 
(MPCP) continues to operate in the Apurímac , Ene, and Mantaro valleys, in al-
liance with drug cartels. On May 23, the P eruvian Joint Chiefs of Staff reported 
that the MPC P committed a massacre, ki lling 16 civilians in San Miguel del Ene, 
including four children. 
Police Abuse  
Police used ex cessive fo rce in Lima against largely  peaceful demons trators 
protesting the removal of President Vizc arra in November 2020. Over 200 people 
were injured and two protesters were killed in the protests.  
Security forces  have also used excessive force when responding to largely 
peaceful protests that sometimes turned violent over mining and other large-scale development projects. According to the Ombudsperson’s Office, 17 pro-
testers or bystanders died in the context of protests between June 2020 and June 2021. 
Law 30151, passed in 2014, granting immunity to police who kill in “fulfilment of 
their duty,” may make it impossible to hold accountable police who use exces-sive forc e resulting in death, despite Decr ee 1186, issued in 2015, limiting police 
use of force. 
In addition, in March 2020, Congress approved a so-called Police Protection 
Law, which revokes the p rovision in Decr ee 1186 requiring that  any use of force 
be proportionate to the gravity of the threat.  
In November 2021, the government deploye d soldiers in Lima and Callao to sup-
port police efforts to address drug trafficking and organized crime.  
524WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Expression  
Threats to freedom of expression continue to be a concern in Peru, with some 
journalists facing prosecution for their work under Peru’s criminal defamation laws.  
Since late 2018, jour nalists Paola Ugaz and Pedro Sali nas have been repeat edly 
accused of defamation in connection with their reporting on sexual abuse scan-dals involving a Catholic lay organization. Currently, Ugaz is facing four appar-
ently spurious lawsuits, all pending at time of writing. 
In May, reports emerged that the producer of a popular Sunday news show, 
“Cuarto Poder,” had been fired because she had refused to take sides in her 
electoral cover age. Th is prompted a letter of protest to  the t elevis ion network’s 
board of directors from the journalists who had been working with her. Soon 
after, two producers were fired and sev en journalists resigned in protest, citing 
pressure to cover the elections in ways favorable to presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori. 
In August, the Castillo administration’s caucus in Congress introduced a bill de-
claring of “public necessity” the “fair and equitable distribution of the electro-magnetic spectrum.” The bill would allow the government to issue undefined “temporary measures” in cases of emergency (such as the Covid-19 pandemic), 
including taking over telecommunication services on a “transitory and excep-tional basis.” 
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Gender-based violence is a significant problem in Peru. The Ministry of Women 
reported 131 “femicides”—defined as the killing of a woman in certain contexts, including domestic violence—in 2020, and  73 from January through June 2021. 
Access to legal abortion in Peru is still very limited. Women and girls can legally 
access abortions only in cases of risk to the life or health of the pregnant person. In 2014 the Ministry of Health adopted national technical guidelines for legal therapeutic abortions, but many health service providers have failed to imple-ment them, leading to barriers to access to legal abortion. These guidelines have 
525HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHsince been challenged in two separate co urt filings by anti-abortion groups. Both 
cases were dismissed but appeals remained pending at time of writing.  
On April 28, 2021, Promsex, a sexual rights organization, petitioned courts to de-
clare a 2009 Constitutional Court ruling that had banned free distribution of 
emergency contraception pills inapplicable. The case remained pending at time of writing. 
Disability Rights   
Peru has a legal fr amework recognizing full legal capa city for people with disabil-
ities, but the country’s  civil registry has failed  to take action to include people 
with disabilities who were previously under guardianship on the national voting 
register. This deprives them of their right to vote. At time of writing, the Peru-vian executive branch had not issued enabling legislation fully to implement legal capacity for people with disabilities.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
President Castillo opposes legalizing s ame-sex marriage. In a speech on the 
campaign trail, he said th at recognition of trans people was an “idiosyn crasy” 
that “should  be thrown in the garb age.” He has also exp ressed oppos ition to in-
cluding a gender focus in school curricula, which fosters tolerance around gen-
der and sexual diversity. 
In July, President Castillo appointed Guido Bellido as prime minister. Media re-
ported a long history of misogynist, homophobic, and transphobic statements from Bellido, prompting calls that he be replaced. In October, Castillo forced Bel-lido to resign as part of a cabinet shake-up. 
Same-sex couples in Peru ar e not allowed to  marry or enter into civil unions. 
Some courts have begun recognizing same- sex marriages contracted by Peru-
vians abroad. In November 2020, the Constitutional Court denied recognition to a same-sex couple married abroad. 
In August 2020 , a judge ordered the civi l registry to al low tr ansgender Peru vians 
to change their name and gender marker on national identity documents. The registry’s appeal remained pending at time of writing. 
526WORLD REPORT 2022Human Rights Defenders  and Community Leaders  
Human rights defenders, environmental defenders, and community leaders, 
have been threatened and killed in recent years. In 2019, the Ministry of Justice established an inter-agency mechanism  for the protection of human rights de-
fenders.  
In February, Herasmo García and Yene s Ríos Bonsano, two Cacataibo Indigenous 
environmental defenders who pa rticipated in their communitie s’ efforts to repel 
illegal logging, were killed in the Amazonian region of Ucayali. In March, Estela Casanto, an Asháninka Indigenous le ader and environmental defender, was 
killed in the central region of Junín; her community’s territory is allegedly experi-encing land  invas ions, which she opposed. In July , Mario Marcos López, an 
Asháninka Indigenous environmental def ender who leads a local organization 
that admini sters a protected  area, was s hot in an Amaz onian part of the region 
of Pasco, and later died from his injury. At the time of writting, nobody had been charged in connection with the crime.  
Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Migrants  
More than 496,000 Venezuelans were seeking asylum in Peru at time of writing. 
In his inauguration speech, President Castillo issued a “72-hour ultimatum” to 
“foreign criminals” to leave the country. Xenophobia continues to be a problem, particularly against Venezuelans, who have at times been victims of violent at-tacks.  
In July, the government reintroduced t emporary residence permits in a bid to reg-
ularize the situation of undocumented migrants, after having eliminated them in 2019. Regulations gave undocumented immigrants 180 days to request a permit 
allowing them to perform undefined “activities” for a year. 
Economic and Social Rights  
The Covid-19 pandemic, and measures in place to control it, had a devastating impact on poverty and inequality in Peru. In May, government authorities re-ported that poverty had increased by 9.9 percent in 2020, despite some state measures to mitigate it. 
527HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSchools have remained closed in Peru since March 2020 due to the Covid-19 
pandemic at time of writing. While the government took some measures to en-sure remote teaching, many students have not been able to attend. The Ministry of Education said in September 2020 that 230,000 students had dropped out of school and 200,000 others we re not attending c lasse s, despite being enrolled. 
The ministry had announced schools would start reopening in 2021, but imple-mentation has been sluggish.  
Key International Actors  
In March, Peru ratified the Inter-American Convention on the Protection of the 
Human Rights of Older Persons, becoming the eighth country to do so. 
In August, Peru announc ed it was w ithdrawing from the Lima Group,  a coalition 
of states seeking to addre ss the human rights cr isis in V enezuela. Peru instead 
expressed its intention to promote initiat ives by the EU-led Contact Group.  
528WORLD REPORT 2022Philippines 
Serious human rights abuses continued in the Philippines in 2021. On Septem-
ber 15, the International Criminal Court (ICC) agreed to open a formal investiga-
tion into possible “crimes against humanity” committed during President 
Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs” from 2016 to 2019, and extrajudicial execu-
tions committed in Davao City in the southern Philippines from 2011 to 2016, 
when Duterte  was mayor.  
In October, Maria Ressa, the co-founder and executive editor of the news web-
site Rappler , won the Nobel Peace Prize for defending media freedom, specifi-
cally for resisting the Duterte gov ernment’s attempts to muzzle the press.  
In July, the Philippine government and the United Nations launched a joint 
“human rights program” to address human rights violations and accountability failings in the country, reflecting domes tic and international concerns about 
“drug war” killings. Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, consider the program 
inadequate , and continue to call for an independent international in-
vestigation. 
Killings of civilians and “red-t agging”—accusing activis ts and other s of being 
combatants or supporters of the communist New People’s Army—are endemic to the government’s counterinsurgency camp aign. Many of those red-tagged are 
subsequently killed. Journalists covering the insurgency or investigating abuses and corruption also face ha rassment and violence.  
“Drug War” Killings and the ICC  
In September, a pre-trial chamber of the IC C granted the prosecutor’s request to 
open a formal investigation  into alleged crimes against humanity in the Philip-
pines from the time the country ratified the ICC’s Rome Statute on November 1, 
2011, until its withdrawal from the treaty on March 16, 2019. In its decision  to 
greenlight the investigation, the pre-trial chamber stated the government’s anti-
drug campaign “cannot be seen as a legitimate law enforcement operation, and the killings neither as legitimate nor as mere excesses in an otherwise legitimate operation.” It fu rther said there has been “a widespre ad and syste matic attack 
against the civili an population” as part of a state policy.  
529HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe de cision echoed cl aims by variou s rights groups th at between 12,000 and 
30,000 people have been killed in the “drug war.” The government’s own data shows more than 6,190 people were killed in police operations from 2016 to Au-gust 2021. 
The Department of Justice, which announced, in June 2020, the creation of a 
panel that would review deaths in the “drug war” attributed to police officers, said, in September 202 1, that it  was now inves tigating 52 cases involving 154 po-
lice officers implicated in questionable killings. This followed its 
admission  be-
fore the UN Human Rights Council, in February, that officers failed to follow protocols during these operations. In many ca ses, police made no effort to ex-
amine allegedly recovered weapons, verify ownership, or conduct ballistic exam-inations. In most of the cases the Department of Justice reviewed, police also 
failed to follow standard protocols in the coordination of drug raids and in the 
processing of crime scene evidence.  
The Justice Department  investig ation has faced criticism for repeated delays, 
lack of transparency, and  refusal to involve the national  Comm ission on Human 
Rights in its review. Responding to this criticism, the department released in Oc-tober a 
preliminary report  affirming that police were culpable in at least 52 cases 
and promised to investigate further. 
Killing of Activists, Rights Defenders  
The country’s 52-yea r-long communi st insurgency continued in 2 021. During 
counter-insurgency operations against the New People’s Army (NPA), govern-
ment security  forces frequently  targeted lefti st activis ts, including p easant lead-
ers, environmentalists, human rights la wyers, and Indigenous group heads, 
among others. Government and military officials often “ red-tag ” such individuals 
through announcements and social media, putting them at grave risk of attack.  
In March, nine individuals belonging to diff erent act ivist groups were killed  dur-
ing police raids in the Calabarzon region south of Manila. All those killed were 
previously accused of communist in volvement. The simultaneous police raids 
occurred  two days after President Duterte pub licly ordered la w enforcement offi-
cials to “finish off” communist insurgents. Human rights groups rejected claims that the victims were rebels or rebel  supporters. In December 2020, police 
killed  
530WORLD REPORT 2022nine members of an Indigenous people’s community on the island of Panay, in 
the central Philippines. 
The counterinsurgency camp aign has likewise ta rgeted lawy ers, including some 
representing clients who have been “red-tagged.” In Cebu City in August, gun-men 
shot dead  Rex Fernandez, a human rights lawyer whose group, the National 
Union of Peop le’s Lawyer s, provides leg al services to activis ts. Juan Macabab-
bad, a human rights lawyer who worked on environment and Indigenous rights cases, was 
shot dead  in September, by gunmen in South Cotabato province, in 
the southern Philippines.  
The National Task Force on Ending Local Communist Armed Conflict  is the main 
government agency engaged in “red-tagging.” It is composed of officials from several government agencies, including the military and the police. In addition 
to act ivists and lawyers, the task force has “red-tagged” 
journalists, media 
groups , and even civilian food volunteers . 
One of the tools  the government  has been using against activis ts is the Anti-Ter-
rorism Act , a law Duterte signed  in July 2020. Various groups denounced  the law 
because, as the UN high comm issioner for h uman rights noted , it “dilutes 
human rights safeguards” and creates a “chilling effect on human rights and hu-
manitarian w ork.” Since its passage, the law has been challenged  but has also 
been used by the government against activists , Indigenous peoples , unionists , 
as well as alleged communist insurgents.  
Covid-19  
There were fewer serious Covid-19-rel ated rights violations in the Philippines 
during the second year of the pandemic compared to the first, which had seen harsh treatment of quarantine violators by law enforcement. Age-based restric-tions on movement for those under 18 and ov er 65 years of age prevented chil-
dren and older people from leav ing their homes, although in October, the 
government 
eased  this restriction. Schools remained closed nationwide at time 
of writing, affecting the education of 28.5 million students .  
Authorities imposed strict quarantine regulations  across the country and had ar-
rested tens of thousands of peop le for quarantine violations, some of whom 
spent time in detention while majority were given warnings, fined , or ordered to 
531HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHdo community service. In November, the government eased these restrictions. 
Detention facilities in the Philipp ines have always been congested , posing con-
siderable challenges for vaccination, with authorities reporting success  in some 
pretrial or holding facilities but not in others . 
  
Critics accused the government of mi shandling its response to the pandemic, in-
cluding inadequate initial vaccination roll-out . Vaccination for the general popu-
lation began in November. There have also been complaints of inadequate 
financial support  for communities affected  by lockdowns, as well as failure to 
pay frontline health workers properly and on time, inducing some to quit . In Sep-
tember, a Senate committee uncovered alleged corruption  in the government’s 
purchase of medical supplies, favoring individuals identified with the adminis-tration. 
Freedom of Media  
Media freedom and freedom of expression re ceived a big boost in October when 
Maria Ressa, the co-founder and exec utive editor of the news website Rappler , 
was awarded the Nobel Pea ce Prize, along with Russian editor Dmitry Muratov. 
Ressa and Rappler  have been the target of repri sals from the Duterte government 
and its supporters for the website’s reporting on “drug war” killings and for help-
ing to expose what Ressa called Dut erte’s “weaponization of the Internet” to tar-
get government  critics and d issidents.  
The killing of journalists continues.  In October, Orlando Dinoy of Newsline Philippines  and Energy  Radio RM, was 
killed  inside his home in Digos City. In July, an unidentified gunman shot dead  
Reynante Cortes, a radio broadcaster, as he was le aving his radio station in Cebu 
City, in the cen tral Philipp ines. Cortes was kno wn for h is on-air commentary on 
local politics and corruption. In November 2020, gunmen killed  newspaper 
columnist and radio comment ator Virgilio Maganes in Vi llasis to wn, Pan gasin an, 
a province north of Manila.  
In April, journalists from Northern Dispatch,  a weekly newspaper, were harassed  
by municipal police in Kalinga provinc e, in the northern Philippines, for covering 
an event organized by leftist groups. Journalists of the same newspaper were 
532WORLD REPORT 2022later “red-tagged”  by authorities. In September, leftist media organizations Bu-
latlat and AlterMidya accused  the Philippine military of  launching “denial of 
service” attacks on their websites. 
Children’s Rights  
Philippine civil law sets  out that  a person can only  be legally  married at  age 18. 
But this law does not apply to Muslims; under another law , a Muslim boy can 
marry at age 15 while a girl can be married  off when she reaches puberty. The 
proposed “Girls Not Brides Act,” passed by both house s of the Philippine Con-
gress and now aw aiting President Dut erte’s signature, will make it unla wful for 
anyone to marry a child (younger than 18) and make it a criminal offense to offi-ciate such a union. 
According to the UN , one in six Filipino girls are married be-
fore age 18. 
Another law awaiting the president’s signature would raise the age of sexual 
consent to 16 years from the current  12 years. In September, the Senate passed  
its version of the statutory rape law after the House of Representatives passed  
its own version the year before. Accor ding to legislators, the Philippines cur-
rently “has the lowest age  of sexual consent in Asia  and one of the lowest in the 
world.” In a 2015 study  on violence against chi ldren in the Philippines, UNICEF 
said one in five Filipino chi ldren experienced their first sexual encounter at age 
13 to 17. 
Key International Actors  
The United States  continues to provide military assistanc e to the Philippines de-
spite the Duterte government’s poor human rights record. In June, the Biden ad-ministration notified Congress of a proposed sale of 
$2.5 billion  in arms to the 
Philippines, including fight er jets and  two kinds of  missi les. In September, both 
countries announced that they would restart  defense cooperation agreements 
that had been stalled by President Duterte’s earlier threat to withdraw, including an agreement for 
building facilities  for US troops in the Philippines.  
In February, the EU and the Philippines held bilateral human rights talks . The 
Philippines continues to enjoy EU tr ade benefits pursuant to the Generalized 
System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) , which are conditional on the ratification and 
533HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHimplementation of 27 international conventions on human rights, labor rights, 
and govern ance. The EU postponed a GSP+ monitoring mission, c iting Covid con-
cerns. Negotiations for the EU-Philippines free trade agreement, on the other 
hand, have been frozen since 2019 over human rights concerns  related to the 
“drug war.” 
In July, the Philippines and the United Nations signed  a thr ee-year joint program  
that aims to improve the human rights situation in the country. The program, which critics deem 
inadequate , was the UN’s response to ca lls by members of 
the UN Human Rights Council to extend “technical cooperation” and “capacity building” to the Philippine s, which has seen a deterioration of  human rights 
through Duterte’s “war on drugs.” The program’s 
components  include the cre-
ation of a “national mechanism for reporting and follow-up” on human rights as well as “human rights-based approaches to drug control.” 
534WORLD REPORT 2022Poland 
The Polish government continued to undermine rule of law by strengthening its 
control over the judiciary and sme aring journalist s and human rights act ivists 
critical of  the government. An Octo ber de cision by the po litically c ompromised 
Constitutional Tribunal rejecting the supremacy of European Union law exacer-bated the political and leg al crisis in Po land’s rel ationship with the EU. Attacks 
and harass ment against lesbian, gay, bi sexual and tr ansgender (LGBT) and 
women’s rights activists increa sed, with sev eral arrested du ring the year. The 
government declared a state of emergency  on its border with Belarus citing large 
numbers of migrants arriving through Belarus. Polish authorities have engaged in unla wful pushbacks, sometimes violent, as the numbers of irregular migrant 
border crossings increased.  
Judicial Independence  
The government continued its attacks on the independence of the judiciary. The Constitutional Tribunal, the compo sition and independence of which continues 
to be politically compromised, ruled  in July that interim measures 
ordered in  Oc-
tober 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to protect the in-
dependence of the Polish judiciary were contrary to the Polish constitution. Also in July, the CJEU 
ordered  the temporary suspension of the Polish Supreme 
Court’s disciplinary body, ruling that the chamber could not be considered an impartial and independent judicial body as defined under EU law. In August, Poland’s government 
notified the EU  that it would dismantle the disciplinary 
chamber but failed to  do so, prompting the European Commiss ion in September 
to request that the CJEU issue daily fines  for failing to comply with the court’s 
order. 
Judges and prosecutors continued to face arbitrary disciplinary proceedings for 
raising concerns about the rule of law and  flawed judicial reforms—a direct inter-
ference with their judicial independence.  
In April, the compromised Constitutional Tr ibunal ordered the r emoval, effective 
three months after the ruling, of the country’s c ommiss ioner for human rights, 
Adam Bodnar, from his post despite the failure  by parliament to appoint his suc-
535HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcessor follow ing the end of his five -year t erm in September 2020. Bodn ar, who 
frequently criticized the government’s rule of law and human rights abuses dur-ing his mandate, should have stayed  in his position until the appointment of a 
successor. The government instead turned to the Constitutional Tribunal, re-questing the trib unal to rule the continuity p rovision unc onstitutional, effectively 
ending Bodnar’s term prematurely. In July, lawyer and academic Marcin Wiącek became comm issioner for human rights after an eight -day vacancy  following 
Bodnar’s removal.  
In October, following a motion filed by Poland’s prime minster, the compromised 
Constitutional Tribunal ruled that CJEU’s int erpretation of Articles 1 and 19 of the 
EU Treaty was not compati ble with the Poli sh Constitution, re jecting the binding 
nature of EU law and triggering the concerns of the 
European Commission  and a 
number of other EU member states . 
Freedom of Media and Pluralism 
The government continued its attacks on independent media. According to Re-
porters Without Borders  (RSF) , since PiS came into power in 2015, Poland 
dropped from 18th to 64th place in its media freedom ranking. Smear campaigns 
and lawsuits  against journalists and outlets remained a problem.  
In April, the lower house in parliament, controlled by the ruling PiS party, passed 
a bill  preventing non-European shareholders fr om owning a majority stake in 
Polish media companies, effectiv ely impacting the US-owned independent sta-
tion TVN and its 24-hour news station, TVN24. The approval of the bill followed the suspension of TVN’s licence in July by the Broadcasting Council. In Septem-ber, the upper house of the parliament rej ected the bill and at time of writing, 
the law was back f or consideration at  the lower house of the parliament. Follow-
ing EU criticism, late in September the Broadcasting Council extended the li-cence.  
The state of emergency declared on Po land’s border with Belarus in September 
following inc reasing numbers of migrants and refugees 
bans journalists  from re-
porting from a two kilometer radius from the border, preventing reporters from 
covering stories of public interest. 
536WORLD REPORT 2022Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
The government continued its onslaught on LGBT rights as part of its “anti-gen-
der ideology” rhetoric. LGBT act ivists r eported an incr easingly hosti le environ-
ment making people feel unsafe. Many LGBT people left Poland during the year as a result of increased levels of homophobia and transphobia.  
Hate crimes provis ions in the crimin al code do not  include crimes committed on 
the b asis of sex ual orientation or gender identity and LGBT peop le reported that 
state response to reported threats or attacks is poor. 
Some 100 local regions and governments in Poland continue to label themselves 
as “LGBT Ideology Free Zones.” Following fears of losing EU funds, four Polish re-
gions in September 
revoked  their anti-LGBT declarations.  
A local court in the city of Plock in August acquitted three LGBT activis ts, includ-
ing Elzbieta Podlesn a, charged w ith insulting religious feeling s. The act ivists had 
publicly posted images of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus with rainbows as halos. The judge held  that the act ivists did not intend to off end any one’s beliefs 
but to show support for LGBT people and their equal rights.  
Migration and Asylum 
With increas ing number of migrants irregul arly cross ing from Belarus to Poland 
since May, the Polish government in September declared a state of emergency  
on its border w ith Belarus, banning journ alists, act ivists, hum anitarian aid  work-
ers, and others from accessing the border area. As of August, credible reports of 
pushbacks of migrants and asylum seekers to Belarus by Polish border officials, sometimes violent, increased, with five migrant deaths confirmed in the woods 
on the Poland-Belarusian border.  
Polish authoritie s sought to justify their abu sive migration approach  by ar guing 
that they were responding to a deliberat e policy by Belarusian President Alek-
sandr Lukashenko of allowing migrants to travel freely into Belarus and towards EU borders, in retaliation for EU sanctions against Belarus. Their justifications ig-
nored the fact that Poland’s actions violate its obligations under EU and interna-tional law and put migrants at risk of harm, including death, and the fact that its practice of migrant pushbacks predates  those currently entering via Belarus. 
537HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen’s Rights  
In January, an October 2020 C onstitutional  Tribunal decision virtually banning 
access to legal abortion, went into effect . Women’s rights groups Abortion With-
out Borders, Abortion Dream Team, and the Federation for Women and Family 
Planning reported a significant increase in the number of women and girls con-tacting them for help in accessing abortion and other sexual and reproductive health care in the year since the ruling. Covid-19 pandemic restrictions contin-ued to make cross-border travel to access abortion particularly difficult and costly.  
In July, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) 
announced  that it will ad-
dress complaints from Polish women who may be victims of violations of the Eu-ropean Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms due to the Constitutional  Tribunal’s abor tion ruling. Poland’s  gov ernment has 
failed  to ef-
fectively implement previous ECtHR judgments  concerning access to lawful abor-
tion. 
In September, a new bill that would criminalize people who have abortions with 
up to 25 years in prison was int roduced. A draft  bill es sentially c riminalizing sex-
uality education and supported by the government remains in parliamentary committee.  
At time of writing, a July 2020 government request to the compromised Constitu-
tional Tribunal to 
examine the compatibility  with the Polish Constitution of the 
Istanbul Convention, a Council of Europe instrument to combat and prevent vio-lence against w omen, was still pending consideration.  
Threats and ha rassment of women’s rights act ivists c ontinued. Around  Interna-
tional Women’s Day in March, staff members from seven organizations 
reported  
bomb and death threats, due to their work for or perceived support for women’s 
rights and abortion. Four groups filed reports  to police but stated that, in many 
cases, police minimized the threats or did not effectively pursue investigations. 
In October, escalating threats  against Marta Lempart, co-founder of Ogólnopolski 
Strajk Kobiet (All-Poland Women’s St rike), led police to  offer her protection dur-
ing public appearances. 
538WORLD REPORT 2022Women’s rights groups reported an increa se in reported domestic violence cases 
following Covid-19 lockdowns and movement restrictions, which resulted in some women and girls being trapped with a busers in the same household with

“Everything I Have to Do  
is Tied to a Man” 
Women and Qatar’s Male Guardianship RulesHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Qatar 
Abuse and exploitation of the country’s la rge migrant workforce persisted in 
2021 despite the introduction of labor reforms, in part because of ineffective im-plementation and because certain elements of the kafala (sponsorship) system remained in place. Women in Qatar continued to face severe discrimination and violence due to a busive m ale guardianship policies.  
In July, Qatar passed new laws to regulate its first legislative election, which took 
place in October; however, the laws eff ectively disenfranchised thousands of 
Qataris from voting or running because of their nationality by lineage. This led to debate among Qataris on social media as well as small-scale demonstrations 
led by members of one of Qatar’s largest semi-nomadic communities. Politically motivated arrests and detentions followed.  
Migrant Workers 
Qatar’s migrant labor force of over 2 million people  comprises approximately 95 
percent of its total labor force. Approxim ately 1 million worker s are employed in 
construction, while around 100,000 are domestic workers. 
In February, just six months after Qatar introduced significant labor reforms  that 
allow migrant  workers to change jobs w ithout employ er perm ission and set a 
higher minimum wage for all workers, regardless of nationality, Qatar’s advisory Shura council pushed back with recommendations that would have effectively undone a crucial step forward in pr otecting migrant workers. The recommenda-
tions were not adopted. Qatar’s labor minister earlier 
stressed  to Shura council 
members, to alleviate concerns from Qatar’s business community, that while the law allowed workers to su bmit a request to change employers, it  was still “sub-
ject to approval or rejection after communicating with the concerned parties.” The Shura council recommendations and labor minister comments indicated a willingness to backtrack on reforms and cast doubt on its effectiveness in pro-
moting true job mobility.  
In March, Qatar’s minimum wage, which applies to all workers, came into force. 
In addition to the minimum monthly basic wage of 1,000 Qatari riyal (US$275), the legislation stipulates that employers must pay allowances of at least 300 
541HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHand 500 Qatari riyal for food and housing respectively if they do not provide 
workers with these directly. However, emplo yers across Qatar still frequently vio-
late workers’ right to wages paid in full and on time and the authorities’ efforts 
to detect violations and enact swift and deterrent penalties have  largely failed. 
Wage abuses only worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Other abu sive elements of the  kafala  system remain, namely that a migrant 
worker’s legal status in Qatar remains tied to a specific employer, where an em-
ployer can apply, renew, or cancel a worker’s residency permit, and that “ab-sconding,” or leaving an employer w ithout perm ission, re mains a crime. 
Workers, especially low-p aid laborers and domestic  workers, often depend on 
their employer not  just for their jobs, but for housing and food. Passport confis-
cations, high recruitment fees, and deceptive recruitment practices 
remain 
largely unpunished . Workers are banned from j oining trade u nions or ex ercising 
their right to strike . Such impunity and remaining aspects of the  kafala  system 
continue to drive abuse, exploitation, and forced labor practices. 
While Qatar introduced some tougher measures  in May to protect workers from 
heat stress, the authorities  continued to enforce  a rudimentary midday summer 
working hours  ban. Moreover, for seven year s, Qatar has not made public any 
detailed or meaningful data on migrant worker deaths that would allow an as-sessment of the extent to which heat stress is a factor. Medical research pub-lished in July 2019 
concluded  that heatstroke is a likely cause of cardiovascular 
fatalities among migrant workers in Qatar. C limate change is expected to lead to 
further increased temperatures in Qatar. 
In May, Qatari authorities forcibly disappeared  a Kenyan security guard and 
labor act ivist, M alcolm Bidali, detaining him in solitary c onfinement for a month, 
after which they conditionally released him back to his company’s worker ac-
commodations. On July 14, Qatar’s Supreme Judiciary Council handed down a criminal order stating that Bidali had broadc ast and published “false news with 
the intent of endangering the public system of  the state” under article 6 of the 
controversial cybercrime law, arising purely from the exercise of his right to free-dom of expression. The court ordered him to pay a fine of 25,000 Qatari riyal (ap-proximately US$6,800) and ordered the confiscation of his personal mobile 
phone and the blocking in Qatar of his Twitter and Instagram accounts through 
which “the crime was c ommitted.” On August 19, Human Rights Watch and other 
542WORLD REPORT 2022international organizations called on Qatari authorities to quash his conviction 
and to urgently reform its judicial pr ocesses, including the cybercrime law. Bidali 
left Qatar on August 16.  
Women’s Rights  
In a report  released in March, Human Rights Watch documented how the dis-
criminatory male guardianship concept, whic h is incorporated into Qatari law, 
regulations, and  practices, denies women the right to make ma ny key decisions 
about their l ives. W omen in Qatar must obt ain perm ission fr om their male 
guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many 
government jobs, travel abroad until certain ages, and receive some forms of re-productive health care. The discriminat ory system also denies women the au-
thority to act as their children’s primary guardian, even when they are divorced 
and have legal custody, without regard to the child’s best interests.  
Single Qatari women under 25 years of age must obtain their guardian’s permis-
sion to travel outside Qatar, and women can also be subject to travel bans at any age by their husbands or fathers. Qatari w omen are also required to have a 
guardian’s perm ission in order to work for some go vernment mini stries and insti-
tutions, and women who attend Qatar University face restrictions on their move-ments. Some hotels also prohibit unmarried Qatari women under 30 years old from renting a hotel room, and Qatari women are prohibited from some events 
and bars that serve alcohol.  
Qatar’s Family Law also discriminates  against women in marriage, divorce, child 
custody, and inheritance. Women are required  to have a male guardian’s permis-
sion to marry. Once married, a woman is required to obey her husband and can lose her husband’s financial support if she works or travels or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason.  Men have a unilateral right to di-vorce while women must apply to the cour ts for divorce on limited grounds. 
Under inheritance p rovis ions, female sibling s receive half  the amount their 
brothers get.  
While the family la w forbids husbands from hu rting their wives physically or 
morally, and  there are gener al crimin al code provis ions on ass ault, Qat ar has no 
law on domestic violence or m easures to prot ect survivors  and prosecute their 
abusers. No law explicitly prohibits c orporal punishment of children either.  
543HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHWomen can be forced to return to their families by the police if they leave their 
home, including when fleeing abuse. In Januar y, a Yemeni woman was killed  by 
her former Qatari husband outside a family court that had ruled in her favor in a dispute concerning their child.  
Qatar allows men to p ass citizens hip to their spouses and  childr en, wher eas 
children of Qatari women and non-citizen men can only apply for citizenship 
under narrow conditions. This discriminates against Qatari women married to foreigners, and their chi ldren and spouses.  
Women continued to report that they faced intimidation by government cyber se-
curity for their tweets or other online actions about women’s rights or other polit-ical issues, including through interrogations, being asked to sign pledges not to 
speak about these issues, and being asked to give officials access to their Twit-ter accounts or surrender their electronic devices to them. 
Freedom of Expression 
Qatar’s penal code criminalizes criticizing the emir, insulting Qatar’s flag, defam-ing religion, including blasphemy, and inciting “to ov erthrow the regime.” 
Qatar’s 2014 cybercrimes law provided for a maximum of three years in prison and/or a fine of 500,000 Qatari riyal (around $137 ,325) for anyone convicted of spreading “false news” (a term that is not defined) on the internet or for posting 
online content that “violates social values or principles,” or “insults or slanders 
others.”  
In January 2020, Qatar 
amended its penal code  to impose up to five years in 
prison for spreading rumors or false new s with ill-intent and/or a fine of 100,000 
Qatari riyal (around $27 ,465). The new text does not define who determines what is a rumor or “fake news,” how to make such a determination, or what standards are to be used in doing so.  
In August and September, newly introduced election laws that effectively disen-
franchise thousands of Qataris from voting or running in Qatar’s first legislative elections provoked controversy and debate among Qataris on social media as well as small-scale demonstrations. Qatari authorities responded to the criticism by 
referring seven people for prosecution  on charges of “s preading false news” 
and “stirring up racial and tribal strife.” Informed sources told Human Rights 
544WORLD REPORT 2022Watch that Qatari authorities arrested and detained at least 15 people in the af-
termath, some of whom remained detained without charge a month later.  
Statelessness 
Qatar’s decision to  arbitrarily st rip families from the Ghufran cl an of the Al  Murra 
tribe of their citiz enship starting in 19 96 has left some members stateless 20 
years later and deprived them of access to key human rights. In 2021, Qatar made no commitments to rectify their status. 
Stateless members of the Ghufran clan are 
deprived of their rights  to work, ac-
cess to health care, education, marriage and  starting a family, owning property, 
and freedom of movement. Without valid identity documents, they face restric-tions accessing basic services, including opening bank accounts and acquiring drivers’ licenses, and are at risk of arbitrary detention. Those living in Qatar are 
also denied a range of government benefits afforded to Qatari citizens, including 
state jobs, food and energy su bsidies, and free basic healthcare. 
Sexual Orientation and Morality Laws 
Qatar’s penal code criminalizes extramarital sex. Individuals convicted of  zina  
(sex outside of marriage) can be sentenced up to seven years imprisonment. In addition to imprisonment, Muslims can be sentenced to flogging (if unmarried) or the death penalty (if married) for zina . These laws disproportionately impact 
women, as pregnancy serves as evidence of extramarital sex and women who re-port rape can find themselves pro secuted for c onsensual sex.  
In addition to banning sex outside marriage for Muslims, Qatar 
punishes  con-
sensual sexual relations between men above  sixteen, Muslim or not, with up to 
seven years imprisonment (article 285). It  also provides penalties between one 
and three years (article 296) for an y male who “instigates” or “entices” another 
male to “commit an act of sodomy or immorality.” A penalty of ten years’ impris-onment (article 288) is also imposed on an yone who engages in consensual sex-
ual relations with a person above six teen, outside marriage, which could apply 
to consensual same-sex relations betw een women, men, or heterosexual part-
ners. 
545HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHJournalists and  printers operate under section 47 of the 1979  Press and Publica-
tions Law, which bans publication of “any printed matter that is deemed contrary 
to the ethics, violates the morals or harms the dignity of the people or their per-sonal freedoms.”  
Climate Change Policy and Actions 
As a significant  contributor to the greenhouse gas emiss ions, Qatar is contribut-
ing to the climate cr isis that is tak ing a growing toll on hum an rights arou nd the 
globe. The coun try has the sixth highest  greenhouse gas emiss ions per capita 
globally, a considerab le portion from air conditioning. Qat ar has tak en few steps 
to move away from production and use of fossil fuels and instead is doubling 
down on producing liquified  natural gas (LNG) for export. It  has the world’s third 
largest reserves of natura l gas and until re cently was the w orld’s largest exporter 
of LNG. Qatar has yet to submit  its second Nation ally Det ermined Cont ribution 
(NDC), a Par is Agr eement-mandat ed five-year n ational c limate ch ange action 
plan due at the end of 2020. Its first NDC  contained no quantitative targets. 
As one of the world’s hottest countries, Qatar is particularly vulnerable to the im-
pacts of climate change. Ninety-seven percent of Qatar’s population lives along 
an exposed coastline making them particularly vulnerable  to both sea level rise 
and extreme weather events. 
Key International Actors 
In January, Saudi Arabia ended its years-long isolation of Qatar, which began in 2017 when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates closed their borders to Qatar and expelled Qatari citizens over allegations of Qatar’s support for terrorism and ties with Iran. All four countries restored their diplo-
matic relations when Qatar suspended its World Trade Organization 
case  against 
the UAE’s economic isolation efforts.  
Qatar played a key role in Afghanistan after the United States military withdrawal 
in August propelled  a Taliban takeover of Ka bul, both by ex tensively  aiding the 
US in evacuating tens of thousands of  vulnerable people from Afghanistan and 
by operating daily flights starting in early September to deliver humanitarian aid to the country. 
546WORLD REPORT 2022Russia 
The legislative crackdown that started in November 2020 intensified ahead of 
the September 2021 general elections. Numerous newly adopted laws broad-ened the authorities’ grounds to target a wide range of independent voices. Au-
thorities used some of  these laws and  other m easures, to smear, harass, and 
penalize human rights defenders, journali sts, independent groups, political ad-
versaries, and even academics. Many left Russia for their own safety or were ex-pelled. Authorities took particular aim at independent journalism. 
Amendments expanding and harshening “foreign agents” and “undesirable for-
eign organizations” legislation were among the newly adopted laws. Authorities continued to add more groups to the “foreign agents” registry , which imposes a 
toxic label and burdensome labelling and reporting requirements. They also ex-
panded their registry of “undesirab le organizations,” blacklisting international 
and foreign organizations, including prominent rights group, and used the “un-
desirable” law to prosecute people.  
After political opposition leader Alexey Na valny returned to Russia in January 
2021, having received tr eatment in Germ any for near-fat al poisoning, he was un-
justly arrested, imprisoned and additionally prosecut ed on new charges. This 
sparked countrywide protests that authorities suppressed. Authorities banned three groups affiliated w ith Navalny as “extremist.” 
Human Rights Defenders  
In 2021, authorities continued to  employ a variety  of tools to  harass human 
rights defenders and disrupt their work.  
In December 2020, authorities revoked the residence permit of Vanessa Kogan, a 
US national, and ordered her to leave, based on the Federal Security Service’s (FSB) claim th at she was a national  security threat. Ko gan is the director of 
Stitching Justice Initiative (SJI), a nongo vernmental organization (NGO) that suc-
cessfully litigated hundreds of case s against Russia at international human 
rights bodies. In September, authoritie s initiated the forced closing of Astreya, 
SJI’s Russian partner, on technical grounds.  
547HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn January, authorities interfered with the work  of lawyers representing peaceful 
protesters and human rights defender s who monitored the January protests. 
In March, Izzat Amon (Kholov), who for over 10 years provided legal services to 
migrants from Taji kistan, was st ripped of h is Russian citizenship and deported to 
Tajikistan, where authorities detained him on fr aud charges reportedly pertain-
ing to his work in Moscow. 
In April, authorities opened a criminal case against Ivan Pavlov, a human rights 
lawyer and head of Team 29, an informal  lawyers association that represented 
clients in high ly sensitive  cases. Pavlov was wr ongly accused of disclo sing clas-
sified information about one of his clients. In Ju ly, in order to protect its clients, 
team members, and supporters, the grou p closed after it learned authorities 
were equating it with a foreign organization blacklisted as “undesirable.” Team 29 also represented Na valny’s Foundation Against Corruption (FBK) in its legal 
challenge to the authorities’ designating it an “e xtremist” group. In August, the 
Justice Ministry filed a complaint that  may lead to Pavlov’s disbarment. In Sep-
tember, Pavlov left Russia, stating that authorities had paralyzed his work, and in October, he learned that the authorities put him on a wanted list. In Novem-ber, authorities designated him and four  other Team 29 members as “foreign 
agent—foreign media.”  
In June, authorities opened a criminal case against Ernest Mezak, a human rights 
lawyer who litigates cases at the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). They charged him with insulting a judge in a social media post.  
After a year under criminal investigation, in July, a court in Sochi sentenced 
rights defender Semyon Simonov to 250 hours of community service over sup-posed violations  of the “foreign agents” la w. In October, he was released from 
serving the sentence due to the expiration of statutory limitations. 
In September, authorities barred human rights  lawyer Valentina Chupik from re-
entering Russia and stripped her of her refugee status, obtained in 2009. Chupik, a n ational of  Uzbekistan, provided leg al assist ance to migrants  in Russia 
and was an outspoken critic  of the abuses she documented against them. 
548WORLD REPORT 2022Also in September, authorities fined two human rights defenders, Alexey 
Glukhov and Igor Kalyapin, for mostly old social media re-posts with hyperlinks 
to an “undesirable” organization. 
In October, Soldiers’ Mothers of  St Petersburg suspended  work assis ting service-
men because new FSB guidelines, issued follo wing the expansion of the “foreign 
agents” law (see below), prohibited, among other things, disclosing information 
about the mood in the military. 
In November, the prosecutor s’ office filed a lawsuit to close Memorial, one of 
Russia’s oldest human rights organiz ation, for alleged noncompliance with the 
foreign agents law. 
Freedom of Expression  
Since December 2020, the number of individuals and entities authorities branded “foreign media—for eign agent” exploded, reaching 94 by early Novem-
ber. Most are prominent investigative journalists and independent outlets.  
In April, FSB raided the home of Roman Anin, editor-in-chief of iStories, several 
weeks after Anin published an article with allegations about a high-level FSB of-ficial. Also in April, the editorial team of DOXA, an independent university stu-dent magazine, faced criminal investigation on baseless accusations of encouraging the participation of students under 18 in unauthorized protests. 
In July, authorities blacklisted Project Media, an investigative outlet behind high-
profile anti-corruption investigations, as an “undesirable organization” and 
branded its Russian editor-in-chief, Roman Badanin and four other staff “foreign 
agents – foreign media,” shortly after la w enforcement searched Badanin’s 
home and named him a suspect in a criminal defamation suit. Project Media evacuated some of their staff from Russia. 
In May, authorities designated independent  media outlet VTimes a “foreign 
agent”, prompting it to close due to risks to its journalists.   
In August, authorities also blocked the websi tes of two Open Russia media proj-
ects, MBKh-Media, and Open Media, and the entity’s human rights project.  
549HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn July, police raided the apartments of Roman Dobrokhotov, editor-in-chief of in-
vestigative outlet The Insider, and that of his parents, apparently in relation to a criminal defamation case. Dobrokhotov left Russia in August. In September, au-thorities opened a criminal 
case  against him on charges of illegal border cross-
ing, and again raided his and his parents’ apartments. 
Police detained and in some cases physically assaulted journalists covering 
protests, despite their explicit compli ance with official requirements to wear 
special identifying gear. 
In February, a court in Moscow sentenc ed Sergei Smirnov, the editor-in-chief of 
Mediazona, to 25 days’ detention for r etweeting a post with imagery concerning 
a pro-Navalny protest.   
In January, new legislative amendments came into effect imposing further re-
strictions on free expression. One amendment could allow authorities to insti-
tute misdemeanor proceedings on insult ch arges without a complainant and 
victim. Other amendments expanded the definition of criminal defamation and introduced imprisonment as a possible penalty. 
Russian authorities continued to penalize artistic expression that criticized or 
shed light on sensitive issues.  
In November 2020, Pavel Krisevich ser ved 15 days’ detention for a performance 
dedicated to political prisoners in front  of the FSB building in Moscow, which 
also led to his expulsion from univers ity. In June, Krisevich was det ained and 
later indicted on criminal hooliganism  charges after staging a performance 
against state repression and intimidation at Red Square. At time of writing, he 
remained in pretrial detention.  
In December of that year, Moscow police detained Maria Alyokhina and Rita Flo-
res of the punk collective Pussy Riot and two other people after they staged a performance that mocked authorities for p rosecuting protesters. Alyokhina also 
spent several months under house arrest over a social media post supporting the January pro test and was 
sentenced,  in September, to one year of restricted 
freedom. In June and July, authorities repeatedly  detained, for up to 15 days each 
time, several  Pussy Riot activis ts on highly  questionable charges of  non-compli-
ance with police order s. Three of the activis ts left Russia.  
550WORLD REPORT 2022In March, a court fined  civic activist K arim Yamadayev f or “insulting authorities’ 
and “incitement to terroris m” for a video of a mock corruption trial of President 
Vladimir Putin and two public officials. Yamadayev had spent more than a year in pretrial detention. 
In August, 
police detained  over two dozen attendees of an outdoor photography 
exhibition in St. Petersburg and questioned them regarding some of the photos, one of which included police, and another, a church. The exhibition organizers 
were charged with violating public assembly rules. 
In September, authorities questioned a reno wned actress, Liya Akhedzhakova, 
over a monologue her character delivers in a play which some groups claimed in-sulted war veterans and propagated same-sex relationships. In October, a popu-
lar rapper, Morgenshtern, in a media interview criticized the amount of money 
spent on the annual Victory Day celebration. Shortly after, authorities 
an-
nounced  an inquiry into his statement that may lead to criminal prosecution. 
Also in October, authorities opened an inquiry int o a St. Petersburg artist’s 
painting depicting people carrying portraits  of decomposing bodies. The com-
plainants claimed it was an allusion  to commemoration marches for World War II 
soldiers.  
In October a couple was sent enced to 10 months in pri son for insulting religious 
feelings over a photo in which the woman fake d oral sex, with St. Basil’s Cathe-
dral in the backgrou nd. The day after th at trial, another wo man was ar rested on 
the same criminal charges for a photo showing her buttocks, across the street 
from a cathedral. A court released her pending trial. Earlier in 2021, several women served 2 to 14 days in detention for indecent exposure near police sta-tions and Kremlin. 
Throughout the year, authorities resorted to  expelling or deporting foreigners in 
retaliation for their reporting, criti cism, or act ivism. These included British BBC 
journalist 
Sarah Rainsford ; Tajik activist Saidanvar Sulaimonov,  barred from re-
entry for 40 years; and Belarussian stand-up comic Idrak Mirzalizade , banned for 
life over a joke he told that authoritie s claimed  was insu lting to ethnic Russians. 
551HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFreedom of Assembly 
Between January and April, six sets of  legislative amendments entered into 
force, that further curtailed already restricted freedom of assembly. 
Russian authorities also used Covid-19 as a pr etext for blanket bans on public 
assemblies organiz ed by civic and political act ivists and prosecuted  organizers 
and participants for noncomplianc e. The pandemic did not deter the authorities 
from holding mass pr o-government or st ate-sponsored events .  
Navalny’s arrest triggered countrywide pr otests in late January. Where organizers 
sought perm ission, authorities refused. Ahead of the protests , authorities de-
tained and ha rassed presumed  organizers and  well-known activis ts. On sev eral 
occasions, state universities threatened  students with expulsion to prevent them 
from participating.  
Police in some instances used excessive force  to dis perse crowds. Authorities 
detained thousands  and in many instances denied them access to lawyers. 
Many were fined or jailed on administrative charges. Numerous criminal cases  
were opened. In late October a protester, Gleb Maryasov, was sentenced  to 10 
months in prison on allegations of organizing the blocking of traffic during the January 23 protest.  
In March, authorities in Moscow 
raided  a forum of municip al deputies, arresting 
around 200 , claiming it was organized  in collaboration with an “undesi rable” or-
ganization. In May, a court fined  activist Yuliya  Galyamina and jailed her for 
seven days in relation to a similar gathering  in Veli kiy Novgorod , which authori-
ties groundlessly claimed violated Covid-19 restrictions.  
Authorities continued to hand down criminal penalties for peaceful protest. In 
December 2020, Galyamina  received a two-year suspended sentence and in Oc-
tober 2021 Viacheslav Yegorov  received a 15-month prison sentence, for re-
peated participation in peaceful albeit unauthorized protests. 
Freedom of Association  
In December 2020 and March 2021, parliament  passed two laws to toughen Rus-
sia’s “foreign agents” legislation. The December law drastically widened the scope of “foreign agents” to individuals and unregistered groups. It also ex-
552WORLD REPORT 2022panded the definition of funding sources that could trigger a “foreign agent” 
designation, expanded the inspection regime, and introduced new labeling re-
quirements. The other law expanded reporting requirements, allowed the Justice 
Ministry to ban any “foreign agent” org anization’s program or event, and set out 
additional grounds for unscheduled inspections.  
By July, two new laws on “undesirable s” also entered into force. One expanded 
the applicability of  “undesirable” provis ions, banning Ru ssians’ involvement 
with any such organization beyond Ru ssia’s borders and enabling authorities to 
ban any organization th at assis ts an “undesira ble” group’s  operations in Russia. 
The other substantially reduced the threshold for criminal liability for perceived 
members or supporters of “undesirable” groups. 
As a result of the se amendments, Open Ru ssia civic mov ement—which authori-
ties had targeted since 2019 with “u ndesirable”-related  prosecutions—closed, 
citing risks to supporters and members. But at the end of May, authorities 
detained Andrey Pivovarov , the group’s former director. At time of writing, he re-
mained in detention facing up to six years in prison.  
In February 2021, after two years under house arrest, a court  sentenced 
Anastasiya  Shevchenko to a fo ur-year suspended sentence merely  for being part 
of the Open Ru ssia mov ement. In August, Mikhail Iosi levich was released after 
six months’ pretrial  detention for providing space f or civil society events in his 
café. He still faces trial on “undesirable” and other trumped up charges . 
Torture, Ill-Treatment in Custody, Police Accountability 
Authorities regularly allowed cruel treat ment, torture and suspicious deaths in 
custody to go unpunished by refusing to open criminal cases,  explanations by law enforcement as justification to clo se or drop cases due to expiration of 
statutory limitations .  
In January, a court in Moscow sentenced Azat Miftakhov to six years in prison on 
allegations of throwing a Molotov cocktail into an empty office of the ruling party. The investigation and trial were marred by allegations of torture, and re-liance on “secret witnesses.” The other two defendants pleaded guilty but re-
peatedly denied Miftakhov’s involvement. 
553HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAlso in January, a riot polic eman was c aught on camera kick ing in the stomach a 
woman standing in his way. After public  outcry, the authorities aired on televi-
sion his staged apology to  the victim while s he was in hospital. Later, they 
claimed  they were unable to identify the perpetrator.  
In September, a court in Nizhny Novgorod jailed  a man who a Russian anti-tor-
ture group s aid was severely be aten in police custody on charges of inflicting 
bodily harm on a police officer. Police pressed similar charges  against a 66-year-
old pensioner in Orenburg, whom police reporte dly beat and tasered. At time of 
writing, authorities refused to investigate allegations of police misconduct in 
both cases. 
Torture and ill-treatment of inmates continued in Russia’s penitentiary system, 
despite official assurances following the publication of leaked, graphic videos of torture of inmates. In July, a number of inmates 
complained  of intensified cruel 
treatment in retaliation for an April riot in a penal colony in Angarsk, reportedly  
sparked by ill-treatment.  
In October, after new media reports about  leaked videos documenting numerous 
incidents of rape and other ill-treatment of male inmates at a prison hospital in Saratov region, law enforcement 
announced  they were opening an investigation. 
The person who leaked the videos fled the country. 
In April and October, inmates rioted in penal colonies in Angarsk  and 
Vladikavkaz , reportedly prompted by beatings. 
Chechnya  
Chechen leadership under governor Ramzan Kadyrov continued to ruthlessly 
quash all forms of dissent. 
In February, Russian police forcibly returned Salekh Magamadov and Ismail Isaev 
who fled Chechnya fearing persecution for posting anti-gov ernment messages 
on social media. At time of writing, they remained in jail. In March, Chechen au-thorities temporarily 
detained and threatened  their family members.  
In April, Chechen security officials abducted Magomed Gadaev , an asylum 
seeker and key witness in a high-profile tor ture case against Chechnya’s leader-
ship, two days after France deported him to Russia. They took him to Grozny and 
554WORLD REPORT 2022apparently coerced him to refuse the services of his trusted lawyer. In June, a 
court sentenced  him to 18 months’ imprisonment on spurious weapons charges. 
In May, Ibragim Selimkhanov  was abducted from Moscow and  forcibly  returned 
to Chechnya, where authoritie s interrogated him about gay people in the region. 
He later managed to escape Chechnya.  
Counterterrorism and Counter-Extremism 
In June, a court approved authorities’ request  to ban three organizations affili-
ated with Navalny  as extremist , including FBK, despite lack of any credible evi-
dence that their activities were extremist , much less a security threat. Shortly 
before the ruling, parli ament adopted a law retroactively banning staffers and 
founders of extremist organizations  from running in parliamentary elections. The 
law was later exp anded to ban them from any elections.  
In September, authorities announced  a new criminal case against Navalny and 
his allies over continuing “extremist group” activities. In November, authorities 
arrested Lilia Chanysheva, the former head of Navalny’s team in Ufa, on charges 
of leading an extremist group. 
Police continued to raid houses and open new criminal cases against Jehovah’s 
Witnesses, banned as extremist in Russia since 2017. Russian courts convicted 92 people, 27 of whom were sentenced to prison terms of up to eight years. At time of writing, at least 15 people remained in prison, hundreds under criminal investigation, and 63 in pret rial detention. Those convicted  and prosecuted in-
cluded people in Russia-occupied C rimea. Authorities stripped two Jehovah’s 
Witnesses of their citizenship and deported them. 
Several persons were 
convicted  for supposed affiliation with Nurdzhular, a group 
of followers of the late Turkish theologian Said Nursi that Russia banned as ex-tremist in 2008 , even though it has no history  of incit ement or violence. In Octo-
ber, authorities raided homes and arrested over 15 alleged Nursi followers.  
In August, Yevgeniy Kim, who had been stripped of his Russian citizenship in 
2019 following his prison sentence on charges of involvement with Nurdzhular, was released aft er more than two- and- a-half years in deportation custody. He re-
mains stateless and without identification documents. 
555HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSince late 2020, at least 11 people were  convicted for alleged affiliation with Tab-
lighi Jamaat, an intern ational Isl amic missionary movement b anned in Russia as 
extremist since 2009 although it disavows violence. At least 13 others were de-tained in 2021, with authorities pressing charges against five and deporting sev-
eral others.  
Since November 2020, at least eight people were sentenced, and several dozen 
detained over alleged involvement with Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HuT), a pan-Islamist movement that 
seeks to establish  a caliphate but denounces violence to achieve 
that goal. Russia banned HuT as a terrorist organization in 2003 . In May, an ap-
peals court upheld verdicts  against 10 people sentenced to 11 to 22 years in 
prison. According to Human Rights Center Memorial, as of October  2021, over 
170 people served prison sentences upon conviction for involvement with HuT, 29 were on trial, at least 61 were under investigation and 27 more were wanted. Memorial’s figures include Crimean Tatars. 
Environment, Climate Change, and Human Rights  
Environmental watc hdogs continued to r eport physical attac ks, harass ment, in-
timidation, and prosec ution of g rassroot activists and envir onmental grou ps in 
different parts of the country.  
In October authorities designat ed a prominent environmental defender, Yevgeniy 
Simonov, a “foreign agent.” 
As one of the world’s top 10 emitters  of greenhouse gases, Russia is contributing 
to the climate crisis that is ta king a mounting toll on hum an rights arou nd the 
globe. It is also the third largest producer of fossil fuels  and a top gas exporter .  
In its November 2020 update  to its national climate action plan, Russia commit-
ted to reducing its emissions by 30 percent  by 20 30 compared to  1990 levels. 
The Climate Action Tracker rates  Russia’s domestic target as “highly insufficient” 
to meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-in-dustrial levels.  
Russia has failed to  protect its forest s that absorb and store carbon. Rising de-
forestation, driven by 
illegal logging ; increasingly destructive wildfires exacer-
bated by climate change; and poor fire management, have increased overall 
556WORLD REPORT 2022emissions . In the summer months, smoke from record breaking wildfires  in 
Siberia’s Sakha (Yakutia) region resulted in air pollution  threatening the health 
of thousands of residents.  
Permafrost, gr ound th at has been frozen continuously f or a minimum of two 
years and currently covers about 65 percent  of Russian territory, is rapidly de-
grading across Russia’s north, due to warming temperatures  and more intense 
fires. This poses a threat to livelihoods  and infrastructure, increasing the risk of 
industrial accidents. 
In February, a court ordered  the Russian mining company, Norilsk Nickel, to pay 
a US$2 billion fine over an oil spi ll that caused  massive  environmental  destruc-
tion. Norilsk Nickel said the spill resulted from the impact of climate  change on 
permafrost, upon which all their infrastructure is located. But investigative re-porters 
emphasized  the role played by company’s failure to invest in infrastruc-
ture.  
Right to Asylum, Prohibition of  Refoulement, Migration  
In March and in April, numerous migrants were deported  with mu lti-year r e-entry 
bans for attending peaceful, unauthorized protests. 
At least one asylum seeker was forcibly removed to Uzbekistan aft er “dis appear-
ing” from Russi a; another—a Tajik political oppo sition group member— was re-
fouled  to Tajikistan in September 2020 under similar circumstances. In May, a 
member of the same group who was a natur alized Ru ssian c itizen “ disap-
peared. ”  
In October, a Belarussian journalist  “disappeared” in Moscow and  was later 
found in detention in Minsk. He had fled to Russia fearing persecution.  
In spring, as authorities started lifting the special Covid-19 regime that had tem-
porarily vacated the need for migrants’ r egular registration, many migrants be-
came exposed to heightened risk of coronavirus due to extreme overcrowding at the processing centers, which resulted fr om the limited timeframe to regularize 
their status. Po lice renewed massive r aids and mass arrests of migrants. 
In June, Russia adopted new amendments to its migration law that mandate fin-
gerprinting, photographing, and r egular medical examination of all foreigners 
557HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHwho spend more than 90 days in the country (30 days for migrant workers). Also, 
in July authorities developed a new bill that reforms migration legislation. The bill includes mandatory softw are and digital IDs for migrants that would aggre-
gate private information—including biometric , health, and potentially location 
data. It would also require migrants to sign “
loyalty agreements. ”   
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
The government continued its trajectory of anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-gender (LGBT) discrimination and failed to investigate threats and attacks 
against LGBT people, in which their sexual orientation or gender identity was considered a motive. 
In February, authorities in Khabarovsk region 
indicted Yulia Tsvetkova , a feminist 
and LGBT act ivist, on spurious pornogra phy charges related to a group she ad-
ministered on social media.  
In April, an unidentified man in St. Petersburg assaulted and broke the nose of 
Ilya Bronsky , a gay blogger who earlier tweeted about living in Russia with HIV. 
The authorities failed to investigat e. Bronsky later left Russia.  
In July, a Russian supermarket chain retracted an advertising campaign that in-
cluded a lesbian family and published an apology  after being targeted by an on-
line hate campaign and threats for boycott . The family received threats on social 
media that police failed to investigat e, and later left the country citing safety 
concerns. 
In November, authorities designated Ru ssian LGBT Network as a “foreign agent” 
and LGBT act ivist Igor Kochetkov was designated  a “foreign agent -foreign media” 
Gender-Based Violence 
Russia’s systemic failure  to properly address domestic violence continued to 
lead to tragic outcomes  for victims deprived of state protection and support due 
to inadequate legislation, poor police response, and insufficient services, such as access to shelters.  
In December 2020, the Justice Ministry added 
Nasiliu.net , a group that provides 
legal and psyc hological help to domestic  violence su rvivor s, to its “foreign 
558WORLD REPORT 2022agents” registry. In April, the authorities fined  it for non-compliance with the 
“foreign agents” law. 
In June, police raided a women’s shelter in Dagestan and forcibly returned to 
Chechnya Khalimat Taramova, who identifie s as bisexual and who had fled her 
parents’ home to escape abuse. Several da ys later, she appeared on local TV 
stating on camera th at she was “fine” and was being looked after by her f amily. 
In October, two women from Dagestan were forcibly taken, allegedly by police, 
from a shelter for domestic vi olence sur vivors in Tatarstan and fo rcibly returned 
to their families. Authorities opened an inquiry but denied police involvement .  
Research published in 2021, covering nearly a decade, estimated that 66 percent 
of all murdered women in Russia we re victims of domestic violence. 
Rights of Older People 
Approximately 25 percent of Russia’s population are over pension age . Reforms  
have aimed to expand certain home services for older people. However, funding and delivery are inadequate and inconsistent, compelling many to enter nursing homes or other institutions. Journalists and advocates have 
documented  serious 
human rights abuses in institutions, inc luding use of restr aints, inappropriate 
use of medication, and poor medical treatment.  
In August, the government made one-off 10,000 rubles (US$135) payments to 
pensioners, in the face of rising infl ation. Analyst s believe th is was to  influence 
their vote in favor of the ruling party in the September elections. 
Digital Rights, Right to Privacy  
In 2021, Russia escalated pressure on foreign and Russian social media compa-nies to strengthen its grip on free express ion and curtail access to information 
online.  
Several new laws encroaching on digital freedom entered into force.  Amend-
ments obliged social media platforms to take down content on request of the au-thorities and prohibited them from censoring the content of social media accounts affiliated with the Russian st ate. Another law entered into force in 
April, introducing penalties on manufacturers that do not pre-install designated 
559HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHRussian software on relevant devices sold in Russia. In July, new pro visions  
obliged popular foreign websites and apps to open representative offices in Rus-sia. Sanctions for noncompliance include fine s, advertisement bans, and block-
ing.  
In February, following a wave of country-wide protests, authorities 
escalated 
pressure  on social media companies to censor online content related to 
protests.  
Throughout the year, authorities continued to slam social media platforms with 
large fines over noncompliance with r egulations on content blocking and data 
localization , and eventually threatened  to issue fines of up to 20 percent of the 
companies’ annual revenue. The majority of fines  against social media compa-
nies related to content  about mass protests in January, February and April 2021. 
In March, the government slowed access to Twitter over its alleged failure to cen-
sor calls for protests. Later, authorities stated  that Twitter eventually complied, 
but threatened  to block the platform entirely. 
In May, authorities threatened to block VPNs  for not complying with local regula-
tions. By September, eight had been blocked.   
In July, Russian authorities demanded that YouTube block channels linked to 
Navalny groups that had been des ignated “extremist.” In August, they de-
manded  that Apple and Google take down Navalny’s app from their stores. The 
companies eventually complied but Google reinstated  the app in October.  
Authorities continued integrating public surveillance systems with facial recogni-
tion technology across the country, despite serious privacy concerns, lack of reg-ulation, oversight, and data protection. 
Russia and Crimea (see also Ukraine chapter)  
Russian authorities continued to persecute c ritics of its actions in occupied 
Crimea.  
In March, the authorities arrested freelance journalist  Vladyslav Yesypenko, on 
apparently fabricated charges. Yesypenko  alleged FSB officers tortured him to 
extract a false confession.  
560WORLD REPORT 2022Russian authorities continued to target Crimean Tatars in Crimea with bogus ter-
rorism charges related to involvement with HuT, which operates legally in Ukraine. In February and August, authorities r
aided  homes and arrested a total 
of 12 men, 11 of them Crimean Tatars. In August, a court sentenced four Crimean 
Tatars  to prison terms ranging from 12 to 18 years, and dozens more continued to 
serve baseless and harsh prison sentences.  
Russia and Syria (see also Syria chapter)  
Russia continued to play a critical role in the Syrian conflict. As part of a military alliance, it continues to support, and in some cases conduct, deliberate and in-
discrimin ate attacks on civi lians and civilian infrastructur e, including schools, 
hospitals, markets, homes, and shelters, through what  has bec ome trademark 
tactics over the years, including the use of internationally banned weapons. 
Human Rights Watch has det ermined that  the Syria-Ru ssia alli ance’s att acks 
against civili an infrastructur e in Idlib in north east Syria are app arent w ar crimes 
and may amount to crimes against humanity. 
In July 2021, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) failed to reauthorize full 
cross-border operations into the region and authorize a resumption of aid flows from Iraq to northeast Syria, due to the threat of a Russian veto. Instead, the Se-curity Counci l was able to ex tend the opening of  one border cro ssing to North-
west Syria. Russia and the United States disagree regarding the duration of the authorization, which remains unclear. 
Key International Actors  
In January, the arrest of Navalny drew international outcry. Among others, top Eu-
ropean Union (EU) institutions and a group of 45 states at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) publicly condemned his imprisonment, the deten-tion and prosecution of peaceful  protesters, “shrinking civil society  space” and 
Russia’s use of the “tools of the state to ... to silence dissenting voices. 
In February, the ECtHR 
requested  that Russia release Navalny, and the Council of 
Europe’s (CoE) C ommiss ioner for Human Rights stated  that Na valny’s sentencing 
“contravenes Russia’s international human rights obligations.” 
561HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHFollowing his first-ever visit  to Russia in February, the EU high representative for 
foreign affairs, Josep Borr ell, observed that  “Russia is prog ressively disconnect-
ing itself from Europe and looking at democratic  values as an existential threat.”  
In March, the EU imposed sanctions over serious human rights violations  as part 
of broader package of listings under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime. 
In 
March , June , and October , UN-appointed human rights experts deplored the 
alleged involvement of individuals from the so-called Wagner group– a Russian military contractor with reported ties to the Kremlin–in indiscriminate killings, 
summary executions and widespread looting and sexual violence in the Central African Republic (CAR). 
UN human rights experts and the UN human rights office repeatedly criticized 
Russia for Navalny’s detention.  
In September, 
45 countries pressed  Russia to urgently answer questions about 
Navalny’s poisoning, under the rules of the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 
In June, in its conclusions on Russia, the EU Foreign Affairs Council condemned  
the “limitations on fu ndamental fr eedoms … and the s hrinking space for civil so-
ciety.” Also in June, the European Commission recommended  that the EU “con-
tinues to push back against human rights violations and will speak up for democratic values.” 
Also in June, the European Parliament 
denounced  the listing of German NGOs as 
“undesirable organizations” and Pivovarov’s arrest. It called on Russian authori-ties to end all reprisals  against political opposition. 
 
In August, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Of-
fice for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly 
announced  that the organization would not send observers to monitor 
the parliamentary, due to “limitations imposed by Russian Federation authori-ties on the election observation.” 
562WORLD REPORT 2022Rwanda 
The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) continued to stifle dissenting and criti-
cal voices and to target those perce ived as a threat to the government and their 
family member s. The space for political oppos ition, civil society , and media re-
mained closed. Several high-profile critics, including opposition members and 
commentators using social media or YouTu be to express themselves, went miss-
ing, were arrested or threatened. Arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unoffic ial detention fa cilitie s was c ommonplace, and fair trial stan-
dards were routinely flouted in cases deemed sensitive. There were credible re-ports of arbitrary detention and mistre atment of people accused of “deviant 
behaviors,” including street children, sex workers and petty vendors. 
Political Repression 
The political and  civic space in Rwanda remain closed. Christo pher Kay umba, 
the former editor of The Chronicles  newspaper, established a new political party, 
the Rwandese Platform for Democracy (RDP), in March. This followed the publica-tion of an open letter in which Kayumba criticized President Paul Kagame’s han-dling of the Co vid-19 crisis, its impact on the popul ation, and denounc ed the 
existence of “safe house s,” where detainees are routinely held illegally and tor-
tured. Shortly afterwards, allegations of rape and “sexual misconduct” were brought against him, and he was arrested in September. He began a hunger 
strike a few days after his arrest to protest the “politically-motivated” charges 
and had to be transferr ed to hospital for treatment . He was tr ansferred to  Nyaru-
genge prison in Kigali aft er his bail application was denied in October.  
Other political opposition figures, such as V ictoire Ingabire, continued to face 
obstruction in their w ork, including threats  and ha rassment by authorities. Au-
thorities detained 10 people around “Ingabir e Day,” an event scheduled for Oc-
tober 14 and organized by the unregiste red opposition Dalfa-Umurinzi party to 
discuss, among other things, political repre ssion in Rwanda. At the time of writ-
ing, seven party members, and a YouTube blogger were charged with several of-fenses including “spre ading rumors”, “spreading false information with intent to 
create a hostile international opinion ag ainst the Rwandan state,” and “causing 
uprising or unrest among the population.” 
563HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe September conv iction and 25 -year sentence of c ritic and po litical opponent 
Paul Rusesabagina on charges including murder and membership in a terrorist 
group after a flawed trial was emblematic of the government’s  overreach and ma-
nipulation of the justic e system. Rusesabagin a was forcibly dis appeared and un-
lawfully retu rned to Rwanda in August 2020. His tr ial was marred with fair trial 
and due process rights violations . 
Freedom of Expression 
YouTube continued to be a contested space  for free speech in Rwanda. In recent 
years, frustrated by the absence of c ritical debate in the media, some Rwandan 
bloggers and commentators have taken to  the platform to publish videos on sen-
sitive issues and discuss current m atters. Such matters include evictions from 
poor neighborhoods of the capital Kigali, the strict lockdowns imposed in re-sponse to Covid-19, or the 1994 genocide commemorations.  On February 9, Innocent Ba hati, a 31 -year-old singer and poet, was repor ted 
missing to  the Rwanda In vestigation Bu reau (RIB), two days after he was last 
seen in Nyanza, Southern Province. His poems, which he recited in videos posted on YouTube, focused on social issues such as growing poverty or criti-cism of the lockdown and its impact . Although the RIB spokesperson told the 
media an inves tigation into h is wher eabouts was ongoing, findings were never 
published and Bahati’s whereabouts remain unknown.  Online commentators such as Yvonne Idamange and Aimable Karasira  also used 
their videos to discuss the 1994 genocide, crimes committed by the ruling RPF in 
its aftermath, and the government’s commemorations of the killings. On Sep-tember 30, Id amange, a Tutsi genocide surviv or who accused the government  of 
monetizing the genocide and  called for a protest, was found guilty of  inciting vio-
lence and public uprising, denigrating genocide artefacts, and spreading rumors and violent assault, among other charges. Her trial was held  behind closed 
doors and she was h anded a 15 -year sentence.  
On May 31, Ka rasira was arreste d on charges including den ying and j ustifying 
the genocide and ins tigating d ivisions. For sever al months, he had repeatedly 
been ha rassed and su mmoned  by Rwandan authorities for posting critical 
564WORLD REPORT 2022videos on YouTube speaking about his family’s history and the genocide. He 
spoke out about killings by RPF soldiers in the aftermath of the genocide.  
Dieudonné Niyonsenga, known as “Cyuma Hassan,” the owner of Ishema TV, and 
his driver Fidèle Komezusenge, were arreste d in April 2020 after reporting on the 
impact of the Covid-19 guidelines on vulnerable populations, and were accused of forgery, impersonating journalists, and hindering public works. Both were ac-quitted on March 12, 2021, after spending almost a year in detention. The prose-cution appealed the ve rdict and Niy onsenga was rearrested on November 11, 
after the High Court in Kigali reversed his acquittal. 
After his March release, 
Niyonsenga described in interviews  on YouTube how the 
authorities held him in multip le unknown locations, where he was threa tened 
and told to confess to working with an exiled opposition party that has r eported ties to armed groups.  
Bloggers and other YouTube commentators have said they were threatened or of-
fered bribes to broadcast information that bolsters the government’s line.  
Repression Across Borders 
Rwanda’s government and those operating on its behalf continued to exert pres-sure on Rwandan refugee and diaspora communities, as far afield as Australia 
and Canada. Refugees who are known critics of the government have been 
threatened and ha rassed. In Africa, Human Rights Wa tch has docu mented and 
received credible reports of Rwandan re fugees and asylum seekers being forcibly 
disappeared and returned to Rwanda, or killed.  
Cassien Ntamuhanga, a Rwandan asylum seeker in Mozambique and founder of 
an opposition mov ement, was taken into custody by Mozamb ican police on May 
23, in the presence of a suspected Kinyarwanda-spea ker. He has not been seen 
since. Ntamuh anga was  convicted in Rwanda after a highly po liticized  trial, 
alongside the s inger and act ivist Kizit o Mihigo, in February 2015. Rwanda’s mili-
tary intervention in Mozambique’s devasted Cabo Delgado area, announced in July, raised concerns for the safety of Rwandan refugees and asylum seekers. 
Révocat Karemangingo, a former army offic er in Rwanda, was shot de ad in Ma-
puto in September. The circumstances around his death are unclear. Other Rwandans in Mozambique r eported being threatened. 
565HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn July, Amnesty International and Forb idden Stories reported that more than 
3,500 act ivists, journalists, and  politicians—both inside and outs ide Rwanda—
were potential targets of the Rwand a authorities’ use of NSO Group’s Pegasus 
spyware. Accor ding to forensic  analysis of her phone, they fo und that the spy-
ware was used to  infect the phone of  Carine Kanimba, the daughter of Rus-
esabagina, living in Belgium. The list obtained by the group also reportedly contained Ntamuhanga’s name and phone number, although it is not clear if his phone was inf ected. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Rwanda is one of a few countries in East  Africa that does not criminalize consen-
sual same-sex relations, and the gov ernment’s policies are generally seen as 
progressiv e. However, in practice, lesbian, gay,  bisexual, and  transgender (LGBT) 
people have reported facing stigma. In 2021, Human Rights Watch documented 
how the authorities arbitrarily detained  nine transgender or gay people at 
Gikondo transit center, in Kigali. 
Several said the police or local secu rity officers detained them after members of 
the public reported seeing them with their partners and other LGBT people, or wearing women’s clothing if they were perce ived not to be female. At Gikondo, 
police officers or guards accused them of being homeless, thieves, or delin-
quents and held them in a room reserved for “delinquent” men.  
Covid-19  
According to the W orld Bank, the Rwandan economy was one of the m ost af-
fected by the pandemic in sub-Saharan Af rica due to the government’s failure to 
protect the right to an adequate standard of  living through enhanced social pro-
tection as it imposed stringent lockdown measures, which “dramatically in-
crease[ed] poverty.” This particularly aff ected people in urban areas, children, 
and women. The police arbitrarily detained tens of thousand s of people accused 
of violating public health measures, without  legal grounds or due process, hold-
ing them in stadiums. The government perceives criticism of its response as par-ticularly sensitive. Several people who publicly criticized the government’s response to the pandemic and spoke about its impact on Rwanda’s poorer pop-
ulation have been 
arrested and prosecuted . 
566WORLD REPORT 2022The authorities continued throughout 2021 to oper ate Gikondo transit center, a 
facility where poor and marginalized people are arbitrarily detained and regu-
larly beaten, often in crowded conditions. However, they failed to put in place measures to protect detainees from Covid-19. 
School closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic  affected 3.5 mil lion children. After 
the pandemic’s start in 2020, schools were closed or partially closed for 360 days, including several weeks in January and February 2021. 
International Justice 
Twenty-seven years after the 1994 genocide, a significant number of people re-sponsible for the genocide, including former high-level government officials and 
other key figures, have been brought to justice.  
On September 25, Malian officials announced the death of Théoneste Bagosora, 
a former Rwandan army colonel convicted  of masterminding killings during the 
1994 genocide. B agosora, 80, was serv ing a 35 -year sentence after being found 
guilty of crimes against humanity by the then International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda (ICTR).    
In recent yea rs, the Rwandan gov ernment has requested or s igned extradition 
treaties with dozens of countries in an attempt to have remaining genocide sus-pects returned for trial in Rwanda, although there are persistent concerns about 
failure to uphold fair trial standards in domestic atrocity trials. In July, Venant Ru-tunga, 72, was ex tradited from the Netherlands to Rwand a, to stand trial on three 
charges, including playing a role in the genocide, complicity in killing, and 
crimes against humanity, according to Rw anda’s National Public Prosecution Au-
thority.  
In April, Beatrice Mu nyenyezi was deported by the United Sta tes after serving a 
prison term for ly ing on her na turaliz ation application, and ar rested upon arrival 
in Rwanda. She faces seven charges related to the 1994 genocide, including rape.  
Key International Actors  
The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, scheduled to take place in Kigali in June 20 20 and rescheduled  for June 2 021, was p ostponed ag ain due to 
the pandemic. Poor and marginalized people were detained at Gikondo transit 
567HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcenter in the lead up to June 2021 and detainees said the police told them they 
did not want them on the streets during the event. 
After decades of tense relations between France and Rwanda, in March, a com-
mission established by President Emmanuel Macron to investigate France’s role in the 1994 killings published 
a 1,200-page report concluding that France  has re-
sponsibilities it characterized as “serious and overwhelming,” including for 
being blind to the preparation of the genocide and being slow to break with the government orchestrating it. 
A report c ommiss ioned  by the Rwandan govern-
ment concluded in April that the Frenc h government “bears significant responsi-
bility for enabling a foreseeable genocide.” 
The European Parliament adopted two res olutions in February and October con-
demning Rusesabagina’s enforced disappearanc e and unfair trial, and Rwanda’s 
broader human rights record. However, other European Union institutions re-mained reluctant to publicly express concerns about human rights violations by Rwanda’s authorities. 
568WORLD REPORT 2022Saudi Arabia 
Saudi authorities in 2021 carried out arbitrary arrests, trials, and convictions of 
peaceful diss idents. Dozens of human rights defenders and act ivists continued 
to serve long prison sentences for criticizing authorities or advocating political and rights reforms.  
Saudi Arabia announced important and necessary reforms in 2020 and 2021, but 
ongoing repression and contempt  for basic rights are ma jor barriers to progress. 
The near-tot al repression of independent civil society  and critic al voic es impedes 
the chances that reform efforts will succeed. 
Freedom of Expression, Association and Belief  
Saudi authorities in 2 021 r outinely repres sed diss idents, human rights  activis ts, 
and independent clerics. On April 5, Saudi Ar abia’s terrorism court sentenced  an 
aid worker, Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, 37 , to 20 years in prison followed by a 20-year travel ban on charges related to his peaceful expression. On April 20, the same court sentenced a h uman rights act ivist Moh ammed al-Rabe a to six years 
in prison on vague and  spurious charges related to his activis m. Sources close to 
both cases say that Saudi authorities tortured them in detention and compelled them to sign false confessions. A Saudi court 
sentenced  Sudanese journalist 
Ahmad Ali Abdelkader, 31, to four years in prison in June on vague charges based on tweets and media interv iews he shared to Twitter in which he expressed sup-
port for Sudan’s 2018-19 revolution and criticized Saudi actions in Sudan and 
Yemen. 
Saudi authoritie s released prominent women’s  rights act ivists from prison in 
2021, including 
Loujain al-Hathloul , Samar Badawi, and Nassi ma al-Sadah. They 
remained banned from travel and were  serving suspended sentences, allowing 
the authorities to return them to prison for any perceived criminal activity. In Jan-uary, Human Rights Watch received text messages from persons identifying themselves as Saudi prison guards describing 
torture and ill-treatment they wit-
nessed  by Saudi interrogators ag ainst high-profile detainees in mid to late 2018, 
including Loujain al-Hathloul and  Mohammed al-Rabia. 
569HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCapital trials continued against detainees on charges that related to nothing 
more than peaceful  activis m and dissent. As of Septem ber, those on trial facing 
the death penalty included prominent cleric Salman al-Awda , on charges alleg-
ing ties with the Muslim Br otherhood and pub lic support for imprisoned dissi-
dents, as well as Hassan Farhan al-Maliki  on vague charges relating to the 
expression of his peaceful religious idea s. Al-Awda and al-Maliki have been in 
detention since September 2017 with multiple postponements of their trials, which began in 2018. 
Prominent royal family members remained  detained without any apparent legal 
basis in 202 1. They include f ormer Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Nayef  and for-
mer Saudi Red Crescent head Faisal bin Abdullah , both of whom were detained 
in early 2020 and have been held largely incommunicado. 
In late 2020, a Saudi court following an unfair trial sentenced  two children of for-
mer Saudi intelligence official Saad al-Jabri to nine and six-and-a-half years in prison respectively, for “money laundering” and “attempting to escape” Saudi Arabia, apparently in order to coerce their father to return from abroad. Authori-
ties charged the two a month after al-Jabri fi led a lawsuit against Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman in a US court alleging that the crown prince had sent a hit squad to murder him in Canada in 2018. The authorities also detained up to 40 other al-Jabri family members and associates. 
Over a dozen pr ominent act ivists convicted on charges aris ing from their peace-
ful activities were ser ving long prison sentences. Pr ominent act ivist W aleed Abu 
al-Khair
 was serv ing a 15 -year sentence  that the Specialized Criminal Court im-
posed after convicting him in 2014 on charge s stemming solely from his peaceful 
criticism of human rights abuses in media interviews and on social media. 
With few exceptions, Saudi Arabia does not tolerate public worship by adherents 
of religions other than Islam and systematically discriminates against Muslim re-ligious minorities, notably Twelver Shia and  Ismailis, including in public educa-
tion, the justice system, r eligious freedom, and employ ment. A 2021 textbook 
review found that despite steps to purge school textbooks on religion of hateful and intolerant language, current texts 
maintain language  that disparages prac-
tices associated with Shia and Sufi Muslims. 
570WORLD REPORT 2022Yemen Airstrikes and Blockade  
As the leader of the coalition that began military operations against Houthi 
forces in Yemen on March 26, 2015, Saudi Arabia has committed nu merous vio-
lations of international humanitarian law. As of August, at least 8,773 civili ans 
had been killed in the conflict and 9,841 wounded since 2015, according to the Yemen Data Project, although the actual civi lian casualty count is likely much 
higher. Most of these casualties were a result of coalition airstrikes that have hit homes, markets, hospitals, schools, and  mosques. Some of these attacks may 
amount to war crimes.  
In September, the 
UN Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on 
Yemen  stated that it had “reasonable grou nds” to believe that parties to the con-
flict in Yemen were responsible for grave human rights violations and reiterated its call to the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Yemen to the Interna-tional Criminal Court. Saudi Arabia campaigned vigorously to end the mandate of the Group of Eminent Ex perts, which was not r enewed at the September ses-
sion of the UN Human Rights Council. 
The conflict exacerb ated an exis ting humanitari an crisis. The Saudi-led coalition 
has impo sed an aerial and naval blockade since March 2015 and 
restricted the 
flow of life-saving goods  and the ability for Yemenis to travel into and out of the 
country to varying degrees throughout  the war. (See also Yemen chapter). 
Criminal Justice  
Saudi Arabia applies its uncodified interpr etation of Sharia (Islamic law) as its 
national law. In the absence of a written pen al code or narrowly worded regula-
tions, judges and prosecutors can conv ict people on a wide range of offenses 
under broad charges such as “break ing allegiance with the ruler” or “trying to 
distort the reputation of the kingdom.” Detainees, including children, commonly face systematic violations of due process and fair trial rights, including arbitrary arrest. 
Judges routinely sentence defend ants to floggings of hundreds of lashes. Chil-
dren can be tried for capital crimes and sentenced as adults if they show physi-
cal signs of puberty. In 2021, judges based some capital convictions primarily on confessions that the defendants retracted  in court and said had been coerced 
571HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHunder torture, allegations the courts did not investigate. Saudi laws do not 
clearly prohibit the corporal punishment  of children, which the UN Committee on 
the Rights of the Child concluded  in 2016 “remains lawful in all settings”. 
Though Saudi authorities announced criminal justice reforms  in 2020 that re-
stated a 2018 legal change halting the death penalty for alleged child offenders for certain crimes, prosec utors can seek the death pen alty against children for 
crimes such as murder . Abdullah al-Huw eiti has been on death row since 2019 
and could be executed  even though he was 14 at the time of the al leged crime 
and his conviction followed a grossly unfair trial. 
Saudi Arabia did not carry out any drug-r elated executions in 2021, in line with a 
moratorium  on such executions that the Saudi H uman Rights Comm ission said 
went into effect in 2020. According to Interior Ministry statements, Saudi Arabia 
executed 52 persons between January and September, mostly for murder, up 
from 24 executions total in 2020. Executions are carried out by firing squad or beheading, sometimes in public.  
Women’s and Girls’ Rights  
Despite recent important women’s rights reforms, including allowing women 
over 21 to obtain passports and travel abroad without a guardian’s permiss ion, 
Saudi women still must obtain a male guardian’s approval to get married, leave prison, or obtain certain healthcare. Women also continue to face discrimination in relation to m arriage, family, d ivorce, and decisions rel ating to children, includ-
ing child custody. Men can st ill file cases against d aughters, wives, or female rel-
atives under their guardianship for “di sobedience,” which have previously 
resulted in arrest, and forcible return to their male guardian’s home or imprison-ment.  
In June 2021, the Saudi authorities 
amended  the Legal Pleadings System, remov-
ing language that  required the immedi ate enforcement  of court decisions to 
send a woman to her mahram (husband or a male relative she cannot marry). This change suggests that there is no longer enforcement power for court orders 
to return women to a male relative as part of its judgement on disobedience cases. However, it does not prevent courts from penalizing women with losing 
their right to financial maintenance if they refuse to return to their marital home. 
572WORLD REPORT 2022As of Septem ber 2021, ther e was no accompany ing guidance issued to  the po-
lice and other law enforcement agencies, s uggesting women may still face ar-
rests and forcible return home to their families. 
In June 2021, Saudi authorities also allowed  women citizens and residents to 
apply online for the limited hajj (Muslim pilgrimage) packages without a mahram 
(male relative).  
Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity  
Saudi Arabia has no written laws c oncerning sex ual orientation or gender iden-
tity, but judges use principles of unc odified Islamic law to sanction people sus-
pected of committing sexual relations  outside marriage, including adultery, 
extramarital and same-sex relations. If individuals are engaging in such relation-ships online, judges and pro secutors utilize v ague provis ions of the country’s 
anti-cybercrime law that criminalize online activity impinging on “public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy.” 
A Saudi court has used this law to 
sentence  a Yemeni blogger and human rights 
activist to 10 months in prison, a fine of 10,000 Saudi R iyals (US$2,700), and de-
portation to Yemen after he posted a video on social media calling for equal rights, including for LGBT peop le. Security officers 
subjected him to a forced anal 
exam.  
Migrant Workers  
Millions of migrant workers fill mostly manual, clerical, and service jobs in Saudi 
Arabia despite government attempts to  increase citizen employment. The Saudi 
Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) annual statistics  for 2020 released in 2021 
reflected that 49,600 for eigners worked in the public sector and 6.3 million in 
the private sector during that year. 
Migrant workers routinely repor t abuse and exploitation. The 
abusive  kafala  (visa s ponsorship) system gives their employers ex cessive power 
over their mobility and legal status in the country and underpins their vulnerabil-ity to a wide range of abuses, from passport confiscation to delayed wages and forced labor. 
573HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSaudi Arabia  introduced labor reforms  in March that, if implemented, will allow 
some migrant workers to change jobs without employer consent under certain narrow circumstances but do not dismantle the kafala  system and exclude mi-
grant workers not covered by the l abor law, including domestic workers and 
farmers, who are among the most vulnerable to abuse. The reforms allow mi-
grant workers to request  an exit permit  without the emp loyer’s permiss ion but do 
not abolish the exit permit. The reform notifie s employers of exit permit requests 
and allows them to lodge an inquiry into the request within 10 days. It remains unclear what criteria the ministry int ends to use to determine whether to accept 
workers’ exit requests and whether the emplo yer’s inquiry could be used to deny 
the worker the exit permit.  
In July 2021, Saudi authorities 
began to terminate  or not renew contracts 
of Yemeni professionals working in Saudi Ar abia, leaving them vulnerable to ar-
rest, detention and depor tation to the conflict  and hum anitarian crisis in Yemen 
as a result of not having legal status in the country. 
In November 2017 , Saudi Arabia launc hed a campaign to detain all foreigners 
found to be in violation of existing labor, residency, or border security laws, in-cluding those without valid residency or work permits, or those found working 
for an employer other than their legal sponsor. By the end of 2019 
the campaign  
had totaled over 4.4 million arrests, including for over 3.4 million residency law violations and over 675,000 labor law violations. Authorities did not publish up-dates in 2020, but in 2021 authorities began weekly updates. Between Septem-
ber 3 and 9, for example, the Interior Ministry announced that it had made 17 ,598 arrests, including 202 individuals appr ehended while trying to cross the 
southern border from Yemen illegally. 
In December 2020 Human Rights Watch 
reported  that a deportation center in 
Riyadh was ho lding hundreds of mos tly Ethiopian migrant worker s in conditions 
so degrading that they amount to ill-treatment. Detainees alleged to Human Rights Watch that they were held in extremely overcrowded rooms for extended periods, and that guards tortured and beat them with rubber-coated metal rods, leading to at least three alleged deaths  in custody between October and Novem-
ber 2020.  
574WORLD REPORT 2022Saudi Arabia is not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and does not have an 
asylum system under which people fearing persecution in their home country 
can seek protection, leading to a real risk of deporting them to harm. 
Climate Change Policies and Actions  
Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest ex porter of crude oil and among the top fif-
teen  emitters of greenhouse gases contributing to the climate crises that is tak-
ing a growing toll on human rights around the world.  
According to the Climate Action Tracker Saudi Arabia’s current domestic targets 
are “critically insufficient” to limit globa l warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels. If all countries’ commitments were in this range, warming would reach over 4°C, risking catastrophic consequences for human rights around the world. 
Saudi Arabia has shown no desire to move away  from fossil fuels although in 
2021 it announced it will join other major producers in forming a “Net Zero Pro-ducers Forum” in which oil and gas producers will discuss ways to achieve net 
zero carbon em ission tar gets to limit global warming. 
Climate change impacts, inc luding more frequent and intense heat waves, de-
creased precipitation, and rising sea level s pose risks to right to health, life, 
water, and housing, especially of migrant workers. Saudi Arabia is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because it lacks permanent water 
resources r elying on grou ndwater and energy-inten sive desalination plants.  
Key International Actors 
As a party to the armed conflict in Yemen, the US provided logistical and intelli-
gence support to Saudi-led coalition forces. In February, the Biden administra-tion announced th at it would end  support for “offen sive operations” in Yemen, 
but in April, Vox 
reported  that the administration had authorized US defense 
contractors to continue to service  Saudi warplanes. The administration also 
placed on hold  some US arms sales and transfers to Saudi Arabia announced by 
the Trump administration.  
The Biden administration did not hold the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman accountable, despite a US intelligence report released in February con-
575HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHcluding that he had likely approved the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi. The US did, however, create the Khoshoggi Travel Ban, a new sanc-tions tool that allows the US State Department to impose visa restrictions on in-dividuals “who, acting on behalf of a for eign government, are believed to have 
been directly eng aged in serious, extrat erritorial counter-d issident  activities.” 
In July, the European Parliament adopted a 
resolution  deploring Saudi Arabia’s 
human rights record and urging tough action from EU and member states to ad-dress it, but those calls remained largely unheeded. In 
September , the EU and 
Saudi Arabia held their first ever h uman rights di alogue, shortly befor e a visi t in 
October by EU foreign policy c hief Josep Borrell, who made no public reference  
to Saudi Arabia’s rights abuses. Rather , the EU’s diplomatic efforts remain fo-
cused  on strengthening trade and cooperation ties with the Gulf. 
576WORLD REPORT 2022Senegal 
Arbitrary arrests of oppos ition figures, use of excessive  force by security forces, 
restrictive civic spac e, rape, and other serious human rights abus es continued in 
Senegal throughout the year. On June 25, Senegal’s national assembly  approved  
two flawed and overly broad counterterrorism laws with life imprisonment for those found guilty of flouting the laws.  
Rape, sexual exploitation, and abuse of students 
remain serious concerns  within 
Senegal’s education system. Senegalese girls face high levels of sexual and gen-
der-based violence , including sex ual exploitation, harass ment, and abuse by 
teachers and school officials. Some students we re raped and sexually abused by 
their peers. Most of these cases go unreported , and perpetrators are seldom 
held to account. On June 29 , a 19-yea r-old male student was det ained  by police 
and accused of  raping a 15 -year-old girl, also a st udent at the s ame school. 
LGBT people and  activis ts continued  to be subjected to smear campaigns and 
abuse, including threats and physical assau lts. Media and local rights groups re-
ported dozens of incidents  of assault on homosexual people in Senegal in the 
first half of the year.  
Exploitation, abuse, and neglect of children living in Senegal’s traditional 
Quranic schools continued . Thousands of them, known as  talibés, live in condi-
tions of extreme squalor, deprived of adequate food and medical care. 
Excessive Use of Force 
During protests in March and Ju ne, security forces  used exce ssive fo rce to main-
tain public order.  
On March 3, demonstrations broke out across Senegal following prominent op-
position leader Ousmane Sonko’s arrest in Dakar. Security forces fired teargas and live bullets to di sperse the protests and arrested 100 people, 
leaving hundreds injured. Sonko, leader of the political party, Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics, and  Fraternity (PAS TEF) was arrested aft er a woman accused 
him of rape, 
an allegation that he denied , saying it  was po litically motivated. His 
arrest sparked massive demonstrations w ith thousands of lar gely young people, 
577HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmembers of oppos ition parties, and civil society  members taking to the streets 
across the country. In a March 5 speech, Interior Minister Antoine Félix Ab-
doulaye Diome said the protests were “acts of terror,” “insurrection,” “vandal-
ism,” and “banditry,” and were illegal due to the state of emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic.  
Radio France Internationale (RFI) reported that at least 10 people died in the inci-
dent. International human rights organizations 
documented  the deaths of at 
least eight people during the demonstrations, some “caused by the use of ex-cessive fo rce and firearms by security forces.” Senegal’s Re d Cross 
reported  that 
6 people died and at least 590 were injured, including 232 who were transferred to health centers for tr eatment. Opposition groups 
reported  that 11 people died. 
On June 25, people took to the streets  in Dakar, following  a call  by the Movement 
for the Defense of Democracy ( Mouvement pour la défense de la démocratie , 
M2D), a group of  opposition partie s and civil society group s, to protest the na-
tional assembly’s approval of two controversial counterterrorism laws. The media reported that the police 
responded  by firing tear gas and  arresting  at least 
20 protesters. All those arrested have been released, with one alleging that the 
police beat and brutalized him.  
Counterterrorism Laws  
The two new flawed counterterrorism laws modify the penal code and Criminal Procedure Code and were approved by the national assembly by a vote of 70 to 11. The government said the laws are aimed at “strengthening the fight against terrorism, m aritime piracy, and transnation al org anized c rime,” but civil soc iety 
groups and opposition parties criticiz ed them as overly broad and threatening 
fundamental rights and freedoms.  
The laws define “terrorist acts” to include “seriously disturbing public order,” 
“criminal association,” and “offenses linked to information and communication 
technologies,” all punishable with life in prison. The laws make it a criminal of-fense to “incite others” to carry out acts of terrorism, but does not define incite-
ment, putting at risk of prosec ution freedom of expression, including by the 
media. 
578WORLD REPORT 2022The laws would make the leaders of associations, trade unions, or political par-
ties criminally responsible for “offenses committed” by their organizations, 
threatening the right to association. If an organization is found guilty, the laws 
allow the confiscation of the leaders’ and the organization’s property. The laws also enhance law enforcement powers to  surveil terrorism suspects without a 
judge’s authorization. 
On June 30, opposition party members filed an appeal with the Constitutional 
Council, arguing that the laws are unconstitutional and are contrary to Senegal’s domestic and international legal obligations. On July 30, the Constitutional Council struck the appeal, ruling that the laws are not unconstitutional. However, it reduced to 12 months, instead of the initial 24, the administrative control and surveillance measures the laws allow f or those convicted of acts of terrorism. 
LGBT Rights  
Lesbian, gay, bise xual, and tr ansgender (LGBT) people and act ivists c ontinued to 
be subjected to smear campaigns and abuse. Article 319 of Senegal’s penal code punishes “acts against nature” with a person of the same sex with up to five years in prison. Media and local rights groups reported 
dozens of incidents  
of assault on LGBT people in Senegal in the first half of the year.  
On May 23, the group “And Samm Jikko Yi,” supported by the Senegal Islamic As-
sociation, organized an anti-LGBT demonstration in Dakar and called for legisla-tion punishing “acts against nature” to be further toughened. In June, according to media reports, an employee of  the Senegalese ministry of education 
was fired  
after he asked students taking an English exam at a Dakar high school to write about homosexuality.  
Abuses against Talibé Children in Quranic Schools  
Abuse, exploitation, and neglect of chi ldren attending Senegal’s still-unregu-
lated, traditional Quranic boarding schools ( daaras ) continued at alarming rates. 
Human Rights Watch has estimated that ov er 100,000 childr en known as “tal-
ibés” are forced by their Quranic teachers in Senegal to beg daily for money, food, rice, or sugar. Many Quranic teachers (also known as marabouts ) and their 
assist ants continue to set daily begging quo tas enforced by be atings, and sub-
579HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHjected talibés to neglect. Some committ ed other forms of abuse, such as chain-
ing talibé children.   
Each year thousands of talibés, inc luding Senegalese and foreign children, mi-
grate to major cities to attend Senegal’s daaras. Thousands of talibés are victims 
of human trafficking. Trafficking under  Senegalese law  includes the act of ex-
ploiting children for money through forced  begging, as well as the recruitment or 
transport of children for this purpose.  
Despite strong domestic laws banning child abuse and human trafficking, and 
government efforts  to address these issues, sustained commitment by Sene-
galese authoritie s to stop forced begging and a buse of talibé s has p roven elu-
sive.. There were some prosecutions and convictions of Quranic teachers for abuses against talibé ch ildren in 2021, including for 
beating  and chaining  chil-
dren and for the death  of a boy following a beating in 2020, but enforcement of 
existing laws against exploitation through forced begging remained limited. The government continued its programs to “
modernize ” and support  daaras. Some 
local  governments  continued efforts to reduce child begging and “remove chil-
dren from the streets” in 2021, follow ing the government’s rollout of the third 
phase of this program nationally in 2020. 
Sexual and Gender-Based Violence  
Senegalese girls face high levels of sexual and gender-based violence , including 
sexual exploit ation, ha rass ment, and abuse by teachers and school offic ials, as 
well as rape and sexual abuse by other students. 
On June 29, a 19-year-ol d male student was det ained  by police and accused of 
raping a 15 -year-old girl, a student at  the same school. The accused reportedly 
shared a v ideo about the rape th at has been widely di stributed via WhatsApp 
and other channels, sparking the  condemnation  of the rape and the accused, as 
well as efforts to vilify and  discredit  the survivor’s accoun t of the rape. The gov-
ernment has not yet accepted  the scale of school-related  sexual violence or 
taken concrete actions  to tackle school-related sex ual violence and protect sur-
vivors when and after they report abuses. 
580WORLD REPORT 2022Serbia 
Journalists c ritical of authorities continued to face  harass ment, threats, violence, 
and intimidation. Most war crimes prosecutions  involved low level perpetrators. 
Little progre ss was m ade to ensure people with di sabilities can live independ-
ently in the community. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people continued to be subjected to attacks and threats with impunity.   
Freedom of Media 
Journalists continued to face threats  with poor state response from Serbian au-
thorities.   
Between January and late August, the Independent Journalists’ Association of 
Serbia (NUNS) registered 1 physical attack and 20 threats against journalists.  
In April, Dasko Milinovic, a journalist and  host of a satirical  radio show , was at-
tacked with te ar gas by two men in Novi Sad on his way to work and suffered 
minor injuries as a result. Court proceeding s against the assailants were pending 
at time of writing.  
Journalist Vojislav Milovancevic, at Nova.rs news website , in January received 
threatening messages, inc luding some death threats following the publication of 
his report on a rape allegedly by a member of clergy at the Orthodox Theological Faculty. Milovancevic reported the case to the Special Prosecutors’ Office for 
High Tech Crime in January and an in vestigation was pending at time of writing. 
In March, following an online column criticizing the involvement of convicted war 
criminals in popular culture in Serbia, journalist and professor Dinko Gruhonjic received death threats on Facebook.  
Pro-government media continued smear campaigns against independent jour-
nalists and outlets.  
Smears against the independent Crime and Corruption Reporting Network (KRIK), 
a website, put its journalists at risk. In March, pro-government channel TV Pink  
alleged KRIK was linked to a criminal g ang. Several  pro-government  tabloids 
echoed the allegation. Members of the SNS ruling party and other members of 
581HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHparliament publicly discredit ed KRIK, including accusations it failed to pay taxes 
and is a criminal association.  
The retrial of the four def endants accused  of the 1999 mur der of prominent  jour-
nalist and  editor, Slavko Curuvi ja, which started in Octo ber 2020, was marred by 
several delays and was ongoing  at time of writing.  
Social media platform  Twitter in August labelled the Twitter accounts of some 
leading Serbian media outlets as st ate-affiliated, on grounds that the state exer-
cises editorial and financial control over them through direct or indirect political 
pressure.  
Accountability for War Crimes  
Between January and August, the War Crimes P rosecutor Office launched 9 new 
investigations against 11 individuals and issued 3 indictments against a total of 
4 individuals. An appeals court in Belgrade convicted one low-ranking official of war crimes. The first instance court in Belgrade handed down 7 convictions for war crimes in the same time period. As of August, 15 cases against 32 defen-dants were pending before Serbian courts.  
The Appeals Court in Belgrade in July 
reduced the sentence  of former Bosnian 
Serb Army soldier Dragomir Kezunovic from fourt een to five years for his role in 
the detention and kil ling of 28 civilians in Bosnia and Herz egovina (BiH) in June 
1992. Kezunovic had been convicted and sentenced in absentia by the State Court in BiH before the case was tak en over by the Serbian court.  
In June, following a retrial, the High Court in Belgrade 
sentenced  former Bosnian 
Serb soldier, Joja Plavanjac to 15 years’ imprisonment and former serviceman Zdravko Narancic to seven years’ imprisonment for their involvement in killing 11 civili an detainees in Bosanska  Krupa, BiH, in 199 2.  
Also in June, the High Court in Belgrade 
opened trial proceedings  against Branko 
Basara, a f ormer Bosnia Serb commander, for war crimes ag ainst some 200 civi l-
ians in the Sanski M ost area in BiH in 199 2, including killings and  forced reloca-
tions.  
In May, the High Court in Belgrade convicted and sentenced  to nine years impris-
onment former Bosnian Serb army soldier, D alibor Krstovic, for raping a woman 
582WORLD REPORT 2022prisoner detained in an elementary school in BiH town of Kalinovik in August 
1992.  
The UN International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals  in the Hague in 
June sentenced former Serbian State Security Chief Jovica Stanisic and his 
deputy, Franko Simatovic, to 12 years in prison for aiding and abetting war crimes committed by a Serbian State Security Service special unit during the 
1992 Bosnian war.  
Migrants, including Asylum Seekers, Long-Term  
Displaced Persons, Refugees  
Between January and August, 987 people lodged their intent to seek asylum in 
Serbia, a big drop from the 2,084 who lodged their intent to seek asylum during 
the same period in 2020. The asylum system remained flawed, with difficulties for asylum seekers accessing procedu res, low recognition rates, and long de-
lays. Between January and August, Serbia formally registered 107 asylum appli-cations, granting refugee status to 3 and subsidiary protection to 6. In mid-October, none of the five government run camps were overcrowded.  
By end of September, 20 unaccompanied children were registered with Serbian 
authorities compared to 37 during the same period  in 2020. Serbia still lacks for-
mal age assessment procedures for una ccompanied children, putting older chil-
dren at risk of being treated as adults instead of receiving special protection.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
A law change first promised in December 2020 to allow same sex couples enter 
into civil part nerships failed to progress during the year. The pride parade took 
place in Belgrade in September without incident. LGBT people continue to face 
violence and discrimination . 
Disability Rights  
Children with disabilities continue to be overrepresented in institutional settings 
(73.9 percent of children in institutions have  disabilities) and lack access to in-
clusive education. The government  has yet to adopt a time-bound  deinstitution-
583HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHalization strategy to move people with di sabilities out of institutions and ensure 
independent living in the community.   
Key International Actors  
In February, OSCE representative  on freedom of the media, Teresa Ribeiro, met 
with the Political Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Ser-bia, Roksanda Ninčić, and highlighted the import ance of safety for journalists, 
an independent public service broadcaster and media pluralism.  
The October EU Comm ission progress 
report  raised ongoing concerns with media 
freedom in Serbia and stressed the need to strengthen the overall environment for freedom of expression and journalists. 
In September, Serbian President Aleksand ar Vucic described the European 
Union’s insistence on robust democratic institutions in EU candidate countries 
and member states as 
“rule of law jihad.”  
584WORLD REPORT 2022Singapore 
The Singapore gov ernment uses ov erly restrictive c riminal laws  and civi l defama-
tion suits to ha rass and p rosecute critical  voices, including activis ts, bloggers, 
and journalists. There is little freedom of assembly. The rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are sever ely curtailed, and sexual rela-
tions between men remain a criminal off ense. There are no legal protections 
against disc rimination on the b asis of sex ual orientation or gender identity.  
Freedom of Assembly and Expression 
In October 2021, Parliament passed  the draconian Foreign Interference (Counter-
Measures) Act  (FICA). The law gives sweeping powers  to the home minister to re-
quire removal or disabling of online cont ent, publication of mandatory messages 
drafted by the government, banning of apps from being downloadable in Singa-
pore, and disclosure of information by  internet and social media companies, re-
inforced by severe criminal penalties and with judicial review limited to 
procedural matters.  
The government can also designate ind ividuals as “politically significant per-
sons,” after which they may be required to follow strict limits on sources of fund-ing and to disclo se all links w ith foreigners. The law’s  broad language 
encompass es a wide r ange of ordinary act ivitie s by civil society, ac ademics, and 
journalists who engage with non-Singaporeans in doing their work. 
The government maintains strict restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly 
through the Public Order Act (POA), requiring a police permit f or any “cause-re-
lated” assembly if it is held in a public place or in a private venue if members of the general public are invited. The definition of what is treated as an assembly is extremely broad, and those who fail to obtain the required permits face criminal charges. 
Even a single person standing alone holding a sign has been treated as an “as-
sembly” requiring a permit. In March 2021, the police announced they were 
in-
vestigating Louis Ng , a member of parliament, for possible violation of the POA 
based on social media photos showing him alongside several food hawkers 
585HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHholding a sign sa ying, “support them.” Ng said the p osting was int ended to en-
courage residents to support the hawkers. 
The Public Or der Act provides the po lice comm issioner with authority to  reject 
any permit application for an assembly or pr ocession “directed towards a politi-
cal end” if any foreigner is found to be involved. In February 2021, the police an-nounced an investigation of three ind ividuals who had held a brief protest 
outside the Myanmar embassy. The authorities said that permits would not be granted for any protest related to  political issues in other countries.  
Attacks on Human Rights Defenders 
Singapore’s rest rictive laws are frequently u sed against act ivists and media criti-
cal of the government . Activist Jolovan Wham faced mu ltiple charge s under the 
POA for peaceful protests, including standing by himself with a sign. On Febru-ary 15, 2021, Wham 
pleaded guilty  to violating the POA for organizing a 2017 
silent protest on the rapid transit system. He also pleaded guilty to vandalism for taping a piece of paper on the window and  to refusing to sign a police state-
ment. He was sent enced to a fine of S$8 ,000 (US$5,900) or imprisonment  for 32 
days. Wham paid the fine for refusing to sign the police statement but opted to serve the default jail term of 22 days for the other offenses. 
In August 2021, Wham was t ried on charges of  holding an unlawful assembly for 
briefly holding up a sign in front of the courthouse, taking a photo, and leaving. Wham is also fac ing unlawful as sembly charges, filed in November 2020, for 
standing in front of a police station holding a placard bearing a “smiley face” in 
support of two yo ung act ivists u nder inves tigation. 
In March 2021, the High Court of Singapore ordered 
blogger and act ivist Leong 
Sze Hian  to pay Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong S$133,000 (US$98,600) in dam-
ages for sharing a link on his Facebook page, without comment, to an article al-
leging that the prime mini ster was a ta rget of a corru ption inves tigation. 
Lawyers defending inmates on death row have faced repercussions. In May 
2021, the Court of Appeal fined lawyer M. Ravi S$5,000  (US$3,700) for making 
an “unmeritorious” application to reopen the ca se of a death row defendant.  
586WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Media 
Authorities have repeatedly  targeted The Online Citizen, one of the few inde-
pendent media outlets in Singapore, and its editor, Terry Xu. On August 19, 2021, the attorney general began contempt proc eedings against Xu over the portal’s 
January 2021 republication of a blog post on Singapore’s legal system. Singa-pore’s Administration of Jus tice (Protection) Act contains overly broad and vague 
powers to punish for contempt, with penalties of up to three years in prison or a fine of S$50,000 (US$37 ,000). 
On September 3, 2 021, Xu was 
found liable  for defaming the prime minister by 
publishing an article about a dispute between Prime Minister Lee and his sib-lings about their fami ly home. The author of the article was also foun d liable. 
The court awarded Lee S$160,000 (US$118,600) in general damages and S$50,000 (US$37 ,000) in aggravated damages, and, on October 13, ordered Xu 
to pay nearly S$88,000 (US$65,000) in legal fees and disbursements. On Sep-tember 14, the InfoComm Media Development Authority suspended The Online Citizen’s license for alleged violation of media funding rules.  
New Naratif, an online media outlet focusing on issues in Southeast Asia, was 
accused of 
violating campaign regulations  during the 2020 general election by 
paying to boost certain posts. After a year-long investigation in which the police 
twice interrogated New Naratif’s fou nder and managing director, Dr. Thum Ping 
Tjin, raided his home, and seized his laptop and mobile phone, the police is-
sued a “stern warning”  in the case. 
Criminal Justice System  
Singapore retains the death penalty, which is mandated for many drug offenses 
and certain other crimes. However, u nder provis ions introduced  in 2012, judges 
have some disc retion to bypass the mand atory penalty  and sentenc e low-level 
offenders to life in prison and caning. Ther e is little transparency on the timing of 
executions, which often take place with short notice. 
In March 2021, the High Court confirmed that the Singapore Prison Service had 
forwarded private correspondence of 13 death row inmates to the attorney-gen-eral without their consent. The High Court 
dismissed an application  brought by 
22 death row inmates for information about disclosure of the letters.  
587HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUse of corporal punishment is common in Singapore. For medically fit males 
ages 16 to 50, caning is mandatory for a wide range of crimes. Such caning con-
stitutes torture under international law.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
The rights of LGBT people in Singapore are severely restricted. At time of writing, 
the Court of Appeal had yet to issue an opinion on appeals from a High Court de-
cision  rejecting three constitutional challenges to Criminal Code section 377A, 
which makes sexual relations between two male persons a criminal offense. 
There are no legal  protections ag ainst discrimin ation on the b asis of sex ual ori-
entation or gender identity. Singapore precludes LGBT grou ps from registering  
and operating legally.  
In May 2021, the government warned the US Embassy  “not to interfere” in do-
mestic political or social matters, including “how sexual orientation should be 
dealt with in public policy,” after the embassy co-hosted a webinar with a Singa-pore nongovernmental organization that supports LGBTIQ individuals. 
Migrant Workers and Labor Exploitation  
Foreign migrant workers are subject to labor rights abuses and exploitation through exorbitant debts owed to recruitment agents, non-payment of wages, re-strictions on movement, confiscation of passports, and sometimes physical and sexual violence. Foreign w omen employed as domestic w orkers are particularly 
vulnerable to vio lence. In June 202 1, an emplo yer was 
sentenced to 30 years in 
prison  for torturing and killing her domestic worker. 
Work permits of migrant workers in Singapore are tied to a particular employer, 
leaving them extremely vulnerable to exp loitation. Foreign domestic workers, 
who are covered by the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act rather than the 
Employment Act, are excluded from ma ny key labor protections, such as limits 
on daily work hours and mandatory days off. In July 2021, the Ministry of Man-power announced limited 
new measures  to protect migrant domestic workers 
from abuse, including one mandatory day off per month, post-placement inter-
views, and enhancement of r equired medical check-ups.  
588WORLD REPORT 2022Many migrant workers in Singapore are housed in crowded dormitories, with up 
to 20 people sharing a room and communal bathrooms, in unsanitary conditions that increased the risk of Covid-19. Since April 2020, workers living in dormito-
ries have been 
unable to leave them except for work  under Covid-19 related re-
strictions. In September 2021, the government announced a pilot scheme  to 
allow up to 500 fully vaccinated migr ant workers per week to leave the dormito-
ries to visit specific designated areas. 
Key International Actors  
Singapore is a regional hub for international business and maintains good politi-
cal and economic relations with both the United States, which considers it a key security al ly, and China. Du ring visits to  the city-st ate in 2021, neither US Vice 
President Kamala Harris nor US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin publicly raised Singapore’s poor human rights record.  
In May, Singapore underwent its third Universal Periodic Review at the UN 
Human Rights Council in Geneva. During the review, states made a large number of recommendations, including to address issue s related to migrant workers, 
anti-discrimination legislation, and freedom of expression. 
589HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSomalia 
During a year that marked the 30th anniversary of the collapse of the Somali 
state, domestic and internation al attention was focused  on plans f or the del ayed 
parliamentary and presidential electoral pr ocess. Political tensions stalled re-
form efforts key to advancing human rights  in the country, while conflict-related 
abuses, insecurity, and  humanitarian and  health crises took a heavy toll on civil-
ians. 
All parties to the conflict in Somalia c ommitted violations of international hu-
manitarian law, some amounting to war crimes. The Islamist armed group Al-Shabab conducted  indiscrimin ate and targeted  attacks on civi lians and forcibly 
recruited children. 
Inter-clan  and intra-security force violence killed, injured, and 
displaced civi lians, as did sporadic  military operations  against Al-Shabab by So-
mali government  forces, troops from the Af rican Union M ission in Somalia (AMI-
SOM), and other foreign forces. 
Federal and regional authorities continued to  intimidate, attack, arb itrarily ar-
rest, and at times prosecute journ alists, including by using the country’s out-
dated penal code. Somalia continued to r ely on military court proceedings that 
violated international fair trial standards; it did not hand over Al-Shabab cases 
from military to civili an courts.  
Key legal and institutional reforms stagnated. The review of the country’s out-
dated penal code stopped; there was no mov ement on the p assing of federal 
legislation on sexual offenses or on key child’s rights legislation. The govern-
ment also failed  to establish  a national  human rights c ommiss ion; the appoint-
ment of comm issioner s has been pending since 2018.  
Allegations that Somali soldiers were trained in Eritrea and deployed in 
Ethiopia’s Tigray conflict added to the political tensions. The disappearance of the former intelligence official, Ikran Tahlil  Farah, reportedly missing since late 
June, led to a standoff between President Mohammed Abdullahi “Farmajo” and Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble, including over the control of the coun-try’s powerful national intelligence and security agency (NISA).  
590WORLD REPORT 2022Attacks on Civilians  
The United Nations  Assist ance M ission in Somalia (UNSOM) reco rded at least 
899 civi lian casualties , including 441 killings, between late November 2020 
and late July; a marked increase c ompared to the same reporting period the pre-
vious year. Most were killed during ta rgeted and indiscriminate Al-Shabab at-
tacks using improvised explosive  devices (IEDs), suicide bombings , and 
shelling , as well as assassin ations.  
After the parliament extended the presidenti al term on April 25 by two years, 
armed confrontations between security forces  linked to different political fac-
tions in various districts of Mogadishu, the capital, resulted in the displacement 
of between 60,000 and 100,000 people, according  to the United Nations.  
Federal and regional military courts continued to sentence people to death and 
carry out executions despite serious due process concerns. Puntland executed 
21 men convicted by military courts of Al-Shabab membership and killings on 
June 27 , in three separate locations.  
Al-Shabab fighters killed dozens of ind ividuals it accused of working or spying 
for the government and foreign forc es, often after unfair trials.  
The UN attributed  six civilian ca sualties to AMISOM forc es between late 2020 
and late July. AMISOM established a board of inquiry  into an August 10 incident 
involving Ugandan soldiers who were ambushed by Al-Shabab fighters  around 
Golweyn, Low er Shabelle and  responded by killing sev en civi lians. A Ugandan 
court martial found five soldiers respons ible for the killings, sentencing two to 
death. Reports  of civi lian harm as a result of ai rstrikes in the Gedo region in-
creased.  
Despite federal and regional investigations into the May 2020 massacre of seven 
health workers and a pharmacist  in the village of Gololey in Balcad District, the 
outcome of these investig ations remains unknown.   
Sexual Violence   
The UN reported an increase in incidents of sexual and gender-based violence, 
including of girls, which often resulte d in the victims being killed.  
591HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHKey legal reforms st alled, notab ly the pass ing of progre ssive sex ual violence leg-
islation at the f ederal lev el. The Somali c riminal code c lassifies sexual violence 
as an “offense against modesty and sexual honor” rather than a violation of bodily integrity; it also punishes same- sex relations. Article 4(1) of the Provi-
sional Constitution (2012), places Sharia law above the constitution and it con-tinues to be applied by courts in criminal cases. Consequently, the death penalty for consensual same-sex c onduct could be enforced. 
In Puntland, the fi rst region to p ass a sex ual offenses law, the UN 
reported  on 
government interference and blocking of investigations into se xual violence inci-
dents.  
Abuses against Children  
Children continue to bear a heavy burden of ongoing insecurity, conflict, and 
lack of key reforms in the country. All Somali parties to the conflict  committed  
serious abuses against children, inc luding killings, maiming, recruitment and 
use of child soldiers, and  attacks on schools.  
Somali federal  and regional  security forc es unlawfully  detained chi ldren, not ably 
for alleged ties with armed groups, undermining government commitments to treat children primarily as victims. The gov ernment failed to put in place child 
rights compliant justice measures.  
The previous year, pending legal reforms sought to reduce the age of marriage, 
including a controversial draft law on sexual-intercourse related crimes—the sta-
tus of which remained unknown—
which would allow  a child to marry at puberty 
regardless of their age.    
When the Covid-19 pandemic started in early 2020, schools were closed or par-
tially closed for 134 days, including sever al weeks in March and April 2021, af-
fecting at least 1.2 million children. 
Freedom of Expression and Association  
Federal and regional  authorities throughout Som alia repeat edly haras sed, arbi-
trarily arrested, and attacked jour nalists. Moments of heightened tensions 
around the electoral process correlated w ith an uptick in inc idents of harass-
ment toward journalists.  
592WORLD REPORT 2022The UN and Amnesty International  reported an increase during the first quarter 
of the year in restrictions on journalist in Puntland. In March, the military ap-peals court in Puntland 
sentenced  Kilwe Adan Farah, a journalist, to three years 
in prison under the outdated penal code for his coverage of anti-government protests. Earlier, a military court sent enced him to three months, despite the 
judge reportedly 
acknowledging  a lack of evidence. The journalist received a 
presidential pardon.  
Several journalists covering protests in Mogadishu were temporarily detained 
and harassed. On September 5, Bashiir Mohamud, producer at Goobjoog Media, was 
filmed  being dragged through the streets by Somali police while he covered 
protests demanding justice for the killing of a former intelligence officer, Ikran 
Tahlil Farah. He was then held for a few hours at the Hodan police station.  
Al-Shabab claimed responsibility  for the March 1 killing of journalist Jamal Farah 
Adan in Galkayo.  
Displacement and Access to Humanitarian Assistance  
Over 2.6 mil lion Somal is are internally  displaced, increas ingly because of con-
flict. The UN said ov er 570 ,000 people were displaced  between January and Au-
gust 2021. Dr oughts, flooding, and desert locust swarm—incr easing in intensity 
and frequency due to climate change—exa cerbated communities’ existing vul-
nerabilities and contributed to di splacement. The UN and Norwegian Refugee 
Council (NRC) reported  that between January and August, droughts and floods 
displaced over 90,000 and 49,000 people respectively . Tens of thousands  of in-
ternally displaced people were forcibly evicted, notably in Mogadishu.    
Nearly 3.5 million  people were expected to face acute food insecurity and need 
emergency food aid in the last quarter of the year.  
Humanitarian agencies continued to face serious access challenges due to con-
flict, targeted attacks on aid worker s, generalized violence, restrictions imposed 
by parties to the conflict, including arbitrary “taxation” and bureaucratic hur-
dles , and physical constraints due to extreme weather. Al-Shabab continued to 
impose blockades on  some government-controlled towns, notably the town of 
Hudur , and occas ionally attacked civi lians who broke them. 
593HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAn Amnesty International report documented  Somalia’s inadequate response to 
the Covid-19 pandemic, and highlighted the chronic underfunding of the coun-try’s health system.  
Somaliland  
Somaliland held greatly delayed parliamentary and local elections on May 31, 
which led to opposition control over the parliament . Not a s ingle wom an was 
elected to parliament. In the run-up to the May elections, a local rights organiza-tion 
reported  that seven opposition candidates and seven journalists were arbi-
trarily detained.   
In early October, the Somaliland authorities forcibly displaced to Puntland an es-
timated 1,750 people, including women, chi ldren and older people, mainly Af 
May speakers originating from South West State in Somalia from the contested border town of Las Anod.   
Key International Actors  
In January, following then-President Donald Trump’s orders, the US withdrew  ap-
proximately 700 ground troops from Somalia. While US airstrikes significantly 
decreased, AFRICOM claimed carrying out 11 strikes in Somalia at time of writing, since the start of the year. AFRICOM 
acknowledged responsibility  for injuring 
three civilians during a January 1, 2 021 strike. To  date AFRICOM has not provided 
compensation to any civilian v ictims or their families.  
International and regional actors were by and large focused on political stale-
mates around the electoral process and  security concerns, often at the detriment 
of continuing to push for key rights re forms. International partners, including the 
European Union, suspended  their budgetary support to Somalia in response to 
the electoral st alemate. The suspens ion was st ill in plac e at time of writing.  
During Somalia’s Universal Periodic Review in May, international donors pressed 
Somalia to introduce policies and legislation to tackle sexual violence and pass 
child rights legislation in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Many international partners called for improved media freedoms, including a re-
view of the new media law. EU member states also called for a moratorium on the death penalty. The 
US called for an end to military cour t trials of civi lians. 
594WORLD REPORT 2022South Africa  
South Africa failed to take meaningful measures to improve protection of social 
and economic rights, which has been undermined by widespread unemploy-
ment, inequality, poverty, the government’s  response to the Covid-19 pandemic, 
and corruption. The authorities struggled to ensure law enforcement responded 
effectively to some of the worst riots and looting in the country since the end of apartheid. The violent riots 
triggered  by the imprisonment of former President 
Jacob Zuma  for contempt of court claimed  more than 330 lives and caused an es-
timated 50.4 billion rands (US$3.4 billion) in damage. Other human rights con-cerns include violence against women, fa ilure to ensure justice and 
accountability for past xenophobic vi olence, and violence against environmental 
activis ts.  
The government’s 
Covid-19  aid programs, including food parcels during national 
lockdown, overlooked people with disabi lities, refugees and asylum seekers, 
and many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.  
Attacks on Environmental Rights Defenders 
The killing of envi ronmental rights act ivist, Mama Fikile Ntshan gase, in her 
house in KwaZulu-Natal province, on Octo ber 22, 2020, highlighted the plight of 
rights defenders in mining-affect ed communities ac ross the country. Activists 
have experienced threats, physical attac ks, and damage to their property be-
cause of their activis m—which police failed to investigate. There was no 
progress in identifying or arresting the killer s of Sikhosiphi Rhadebe, a Xolobeni 
community act ivist killed in 2016 in the Eastern C ape province.  
Ntshangase was a vice-chair of a subcommittee of the Mfol ozi Community  Envi-
ronmental Justice Organization, a community -based organization that publicly 
denounced the impacts of the coal mine on their health and livelihoods and legally challenged the displacement of 19 families from their ancestral land to make way for expansion of a coal mine. As of November 2021, no arrests had been made in connection with Ntshangase’s killing. 
On March 3, the United Nations expert on human rights defenders highlighted 
Ntshangase’s story in a report to the Human Rights Council on the risks faced by 
595HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHenvironmental defenders. On Ju ly 23, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association highlighted the killing of Ntshangase in his report as an example of the dangers women environ-
mental human rights defenders are facing.  
Rule of Law 
On June 29, South Africa’s Constitutional Court convicted and sentenced  former 
president Zuma to  15 months’ imprisonment for contempt of cour t. Zuma refused 
to obey the court’s  order  to appear before a judicial commiss ion of Inquiry into 
allegations of state capture, corruption, and fraud in the public sector. In compli-ance, Zuma 
reported  to a prison in KwaZulu Natal province on July 8, the first 
time a former president  has been jailed in South Afric a. Holding Zuma account-
able has been  celebrated as a victory for the rule of law  and has c onfirmed South 
Africa’s robust democracy and independent judiciary. 
On September 5, just over two months after his incarceration, the Ministry of Jus-
tice and Correction al Services announc ed that Zuma ha d been released on med-
ical parole  and would serve the remainder of his 15-month sentence under 
supervision in the community corrections system. On September 17 , the Consti-tutional Court 
dismissed  Zuma’s application to rescind his conviction. 
During 2021, the authorities failed to ensure justice for xenophobic violence. 
While the 2019 National Action Plan  to combat xenophobia, racism, and dis-crimination marked a key step toward recognizing and addressing these abuses, it has not s ignificantly improv ed accountability f or xenophobic crimes.  
Police Conduct  
Serious concerns remain about the conduct and capacity of the South African 
Police Services (SAPS), particularly its compliance with lawful use of force and its ability to deal with riots in a rights-respecting manner. Authorities have yet to end the rampant  impunity th at encourages abusive behavior by the police. They 
have not devoted adequate resources to improving police training, including training on the use of non-lethal weapons, leg al and appropriat e interrogation 
techniques and on human rights. 
596WORLD REPORT 2022The SAPS used exce ssive and disproportion ate force to dis perse student protest-
ers at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) on March 10, 2021, killing a by-stander. The police initial ly failed to quell vio lent riots and massive looting that 
occurred follow ing Zuma’s c ontempt of court conv iction. The authorities later de-
ployed 25,000 military troops to support the police to restore order. The riots, which President Cyril Ramaphosa label led an attempted “insurrection,” were the 
worst since the end of apartheid in 1994.  
Women’s Rights  
Among countries that collect gender-based violence (GBV) statistics, South Africa has one of the 
highest rates  of GBV in the world. Police statistics show 
that between 2019 and 2020,  the rate of reported sexual offences  in South Africa 
increased by an average of 146 incidences a day, 116 of which were cases of rape. In May, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination gainst Women (CEDAW), 
reported  that South Africa’s low lev els of prosecution and con-
viction in domestic violence cases and the frequent failures by the police to serve and enforce pr otection orders, expo sed survivors to repeated abuses and 
resulted in the violation of women’s rights. 
Covid 19 put the spotlight back on GBV as many experts worried about victims 
being locked down with perpetrators and unable to reach help. Some frontline health workers reported increases in cases of GBV.  
In August, a 23 -year-old Un iversity of Fort  Hare law student
 Nosicelo Mtebeni  
was killed al legedly by her boyfriend. Parts of her dis membered body were found 
in the house she shar ed with her bo yfriend, who was in cust ody facing murder 
charges at time of writing. On August 22, 28-year-old Ndivhuwo Munyai  was 
shot, allegedly by her husband, a police sergeant in Thohoyandou, Limpopo 
Province, who then apparently turned the gun on himself in a murder suicide. 
South Africa continues to criminalize sex w ork and prohibit other aspects of sex 
work, including running or owning a brothel, l iving off the earnings of “prostitu-
tion,” and enticing a wom an into “prostitution.” C riminalization has u ndermined 
sex workers’ access to justice for crimes committed against them and exposed 
them to abuse and exploitation by law enf orcement officials, including police of-
ficers.  
597HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHSexual Orientation and Gender Identity 
The National Action Plan to combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Related Intolerance (NAP), launched in 2019 recognizes LGBT individuals as a priority group given the constitutional goals of equality and non-discrimination and the need for protection against racis m, racial discrimination, xenophobia, 
and related intolerance.  
In March, Human Rights Wa tch filed a su bmission w ith the South African Depart-
ment of Home Affairs on the Draft Official Identity Management Policy to address the inadequacies in the current system whic h do not cater for changes in the 
gender/sex attribute of the identity system. In July, Human Rights Watch filed a submission with the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development on their Draft National Intervention Strategy (NIS) 2021-2025, that provides the framework to counter violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics.  
At least 19 LGBT persons were murdered in South Africa in 2021.  
Children’s Rights 
Across South Africa, more than 13 million ch ildren were affected by nationwide 
school closures (both full and partial) which lasted most of 2021 , due to the 
Covid-19 pandemic. Children w ith disabilities, already most at risk of being ex-
cluded from accessing quality, were most  impacted. Covid-19 remote learning re-
sponse exacerbated existing inequalities as children from poor communities 
had limited access to online resources, leading to further exclusion.  
 Some 500,000 learners reportedly dropped  out of school permanently during 
the pandemic, according to the United Nations International Children’s Emer-
gency Fund (UNICEF).  
South Africa has a high rate of teen age pregnancie s. Adolescent  girls and 
women face many barriers to their rights to education and sexual and reproduc-
tive rights, and tens of thousands ex perience unwanted pregnancies. Between 
2017 and the first quarter of 2021, over 512,000 girls and young women ages 10 to 19 delivered children in health facilitie s and close to 57 ,000 terminated their 
pregnancies, according to 
government data .  
598WORLD REPORT 2022Covid-19-Related Abuses  
As of October 3, 2021, South Africa had 2,906,422 confirmed  Covid-19 cases 
with 87 ,780 deaths, the highest documented figure  across Africa. The govern-
ment’s Covid-19 aid programs, including food parcels, overlooked refugees and 
asylum seekers, including many LGBT people, and undocumented migrants, 
some of whom also faced barriers access ing shelters, either bec ause there were 
unaware of these services, or they feel unwelcome at the shelt ers. Sex worker 
rights groups also noted that they ha d also been left out of relief planning. 
At the end of September, more than 8.6 million people, that is over one-fifth of 
South Africa’s adult population, had been ful ly vaccinated. While the govern-
ment committed to include refugees and  asylum seekers with documentation in 
the country’s vaccination rollout, undocumented migrants faced barriers to vac-cine access. 
Climate Change Impacts and Policy  
South Africa is among the top 20 emitters  of greenhouse gases—and the top 
emitter in Africa. It is also among the world’s top 10 coal producers and fourth 
biggest exporter , contributing to the c limate crisis that is ta king a grow ing to ll on 
human rights arou nd the globe. Although South Africa has inc luded renew able 
energy in its energy mix, it continues to heavily rely on coal for 70 percent  of en-
ergy demand, and  gov ernment has declared  that this will be the case for the 
foreseeable future.  
In March, the government proposed its  Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC), a Par is Agr eement-mandat ed five-year n ational c limate ch ange action 
plan. In June 2 021, the Presidenti al Climate Commissions recommended  that the 
plan be strengthened to prevent warming gr eater than 1.5°C compared to pre-in-
dustrial levels, with the hope of averting some of the most dramatic impacts of climate change on at-risk populations.  
As a 
water-scarce  country, South Africa is particularly vulnerable to the impacts 
of climate change. Droughts and storms have become more intense  because of 
climate change. On 24 January 2021, Cyclone Eloise made landfall in South Africa’s northern provinces, resulting in extreme flooding and the 
displacement 
of 3,200 people . 
599HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHForeign Policy  
In July, the ruling African National Congress party called  on the government of 
Eswatini to implement political reforms and address the legitimate concerns of 
protestors. In the same month, South Africa, as a member state of the Southern 
African Development Community, approved  the deployment of 1,495 troops to 
help Mozambique fight an Islamic Stat e-linked insurgency. President Cyril 
Ramaphosa’s special envoys appointed  in August 2020 to mediate in the Zim-
babwe political crisis, remained , for the most part, inactive  during 2021.  
In his address  to the 76th UN General Assembly on September 23, President 
Ramaphosa reiterated the call for fair and equitable distribution of Covid-19 vac-
cines across the world.  
600WORLD REPORT 2022South Korea 
The Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) is an established democracy that largely re-
spects civil, po litical, economic, social, and  cultural rights, although significant 
human rights concerns remain.  
Discrimin ation against women is pervasive, as well as di scrimination ag ainst les-
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, racial and ethnic minorities, and foreign migrants and refugees. The go vernment also retains draconian crimi-
nal defamation laws and sweeping intelligence and national security laws that chill speech critical of the government and corporations.  
In 2021, the South Korean government implemented public health measures to 
limit the spread of Covid-19, but some of its policy responses and implementa-tion raised 
privacy rights concerns . While schools remained partially or fully 
open for much of the year, closures due to Covid-19 still affected over 10 million 
children . 
Women and Girls’ Rights 
Discrimination against women and girls is widespread in South Korea. The gen-
der pay gap , at 31 percent, is the widest among countries that belong to the Or-
ganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). South Korea has been consistently  ranked by The Economist as having the 
worst working en-
vironment for women  among the 29 advanced economies it analyzes.  
South Korea’s #MeToo movement gained some ground in the past two years, al-
though it also faced backlash. In May, “ men’s rights ” groups targeted  several 
South Korean retailers for using “pinc hing hand” signs in their ads, which the 
men claimed was similar to  the logo of Meg alia, a controversi al online feminist 
community known for ridiculing men that  was shut down in 2017. Following 
threats of boycotts, the GS25 convenience store chain apologized for hurting men’s feelings, disciplined emp loyees, and took down an ad campaign. In June, 
Lee Jun-seok, a politician who advoca tes for “men’s rights” and claims that 
men 
in South Korea are targets of reverse discrimination , was elected le ader of the 
main opposition conservative People Power Party.

“My Life is Not Your Porn” 
Digital Sex Crimes in South KoreaHUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  The government continues to struggle to address rampant problems with online 
gender-based crimes, including widespread internet posting  of sexual images of 
women and girls without their consent. In November 2020, Cho Joo-bin, one of the operators of an infamous 
network of chat rooms  on the Telegram messaging 
app—where users were viewing, sharing, and trading  non-consensual images of 
dozens of women and girls, including of acts of sexual violence obtained 
through coercion and  blackma il—was sentenced  to 40 years in prison in the so-
called “Nth Room” case. On April 8, Moon Hyeong-wook, who opened the first chat rooms  of the netw ork in 2015, was 
sentenced  to 34 years in prison for forc-
ing 21 young women, including girls, into mak ing sexually explicit videos and 
sharing them. The police identified approxim ately 1,100 women and girls who 
were victims of this network.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
The LGBT rights movement in South Korea is growing but continues to face hostil-ity and severe discrimination, especially in the armed forces. In October, a South Korean court ruled that the military 
unlawfully discrimin ated  against Byun Hee-
su, the country’s first openly transgender soldier, when it discharged  her after 
she underwent a gender affirming surgery in 2019. The court ordered her rein-
statement, but Byun died  by suicide in March. The Constitutional Court is also 
currently reviewing the 1962 Military Criminal Act , which punishes sexual acts 
between soldiers with up to two years in prison under a “disgraceful conduct” clause, regardless of consent. 
In schools, LGBT childr en and young people experience 
severe isolation and mis-
treatment  including bully ing and ha rass ment, a lack of confidential mental 
health support, exclusion from school curricula, and gender identity discrimina-tion.  
Activis ts and progre ssive legislators have act ively adv ocated for the National As-
sembly to dev elop and p ass a bro ad-based national  anti-disc rimination law pro-
tecting LGBT persons as well as women, ch ildren, people with di sabilities, older 
people, and foreigners. But the government did not make meaningful progress on such a law, citing a vocal Christian conservative group’s anti-LGBT opposi-tion.

RIGHTS   WATCH  Freedom of Expression  
Although South Korea has a relatively fr ee press and liv ely civil society, the 
South Korean government continues to use draconian criminal defamation laws and sweeping intelligence and national secu rity laws to restrict speech. Imple-
mentation of these laws creates a chilling effect that limits critical scrutiny of the government as well as corporations.  
In December 2020, the South Korean government 
amended  the National Intelli-
gence Service Act  using broad, vague language and authorizing the authorities 
to continue collecting inform ation under the abu sive and outdate d National Se-
curity Law. The law criminalizes dissemination of anything that the government classifies as North Ko rean “propaganda,” as well as creating, joining, praising, 
or inducing others to join any political association considered an “anti-govern-
ment organization,” a term not clearly defined in law.  
In the same month, it adopted an amendment to the development of 
the Inter-
Korean Relations Act , widely known as the anti-leaflet law, which imposes strict 
limitations on North Ko rean escapees and  civil soc iety organiz ations that  work to 
send inform ation and id eas from South Korea to the Nor th Korean people. The 
law bans sending “leaflets, articles (inc luding advertisements, printed matters, 
auxiliary storage devices, etc.), money or other financial benefits” through the country’s northern border and includes sentences  of up to three years in prison 
or fines of up to 30 million won (US$2 5,000), which violate the principle of pro-
portionality in punishments.  
The special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, human 
rights defenders, and on the situation of human rights in North Korea, raised 
concerns  regarding its vague wording, its po ssible disproportionate penalization 
of some forms of political express ion and legitimat e activities of  some civil soci-
ety members, and the effects it may have on access to information inside North Korea. 
In September, the South Korean government backed down in the face of serious 
criticism and shelved amendments to a law tackling “false reporting” that prompted concerns about repre ssion of media freedom. As the s
pecial rappor-
teur on the right of freedom of expression raised,  the proposed amendments to 
the Press Arbitration Law would have imposed disproportionate sanctions  for 
vaguely defined “false and manipulated” reporting. Criminal defamation laws  al-
605HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHready have a chilling effect on media reporting in South Korea, as they allow for 
up to seven years’ imprisonment and a fine, and truth is not a defense if the court finds what  was said or written was not in the public interest.  
Workers’ Rights 
South Korea joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1991 but has 
only ratified four of the ILO’s eight core conventions. On July 7 , the cabinet ap-
proved the Labor Ministry’s motion  for parliamentary ratification of three ILO 
conventions on freedom of association, the right to organize and collectively bar-gain, and the prohibition of forced labor. 
On September 2, the South Korean government raided the Korean Confederation 
of Trade Unions (KCTU) headquarters and 
arrested  its president, Yang Kyung-soo, 
for organizing rallies between May and July calling on the government to adopt 
policies and programs to add ress economic inequalities deepened by the pan-
demic. The government had banned the rallies, citing Covid-19 public health measures. Police accused Yang of 
breaking  the Assembly and Demonstration Act 
and the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, as well as disrupting traf-fic. The union claimed that a major rally on July 3 drew about 8,000 participants, but all wore masks and followed government guidelines for social distancing.  
Policy on Human Rights in North Korea  
President Moon Jae-in’s administration weakened its criticism of North Korea’s human rights record. South Korea had previously co-sponsored annual resolu-tions at the United Nations condemning North Korea’s human rights abuses since 2008 but starting in 2019 it changed policy and declined to do so at both the UN Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.  
South Korea has yet to fully imp lement the North Korean H uman Rights La w that 
came into effect in September 2016 and failed to establish the North Korea Human Rights Foundation, designed to support research on North Korea’s rights situation and fund groups working on North Korean rights issues. The foundation is also supposed to help the government dev elop a strategy to promote human 
rights in the North. Since 2017 ,  the government  has left vacant the legislat ively 
created position of ambassador at large on North Korean human rights.
606WORLD REPORT 2022South Sudan  
Intercommunal conflict, abuses by security forces and armed groups, and en-
trenched impu nity continued to take a heavy toll on civili ans. Covid-19 and se-
vere weather conditions also contributed to a dire humanitarian situation, with the United Nations declaring that the country faced 
the worst levels of food inse-
curity  since independence.  
In May, President Salva Kiir appointed members of the reconstituted Transitional 
National Legislative Assembly as stipulated in the 2018 peace deal. In August , 
following months of delays, the president swore in members of National Legisla-tive Assembly 
with a first-ever female speaker . 
The parties to the peace de al failed to imp lement major p rovisions of  the agree-
ment, including security arrangements  and the establishment of accountability 
mechanisms . While the government approved the establishment of these ac-
countability mechanisms in January, including a hybrid court, at time of writing the government had taken no
 concrete steps  to operationalize the court.   
While the government, the Sudan Peop le’s Liberation Movement/Army in Oppo-
sition (SPLA/IO), the National Democratic Front and non-signatory groups to the 2018 peace deal, 
recommitted  themselves to a ceasefire in March, there were 
multiple violent incidents  between the main signatories.  
The government failed to rein in its abusive n ational sec urity agency , including 
by reforming the agency’s legal mandate. Authorities continued to arbitrarily de-
tain critics , including members of civil soc iety and jour nalis ts, often holding 
them for extended periods without charge or trial .  
School closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic  affected 1.5 mil lion children. After 
the pandemic’s start in 2020, schools were closed or partially closed for 378 
days, including from January to early May 2021.  
Intercommunal Violence, Violence against Civilians  
The United Nations  Miss ion in South Sudan (UNMISS) docu mented hundr eds of 
cases of civilian ki llings and  injuries, the majority  by community ba sed “ civil de-
fense groups.” UNMISS  also documented cases  of arbitrary killings, abductions, 
607HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHconflict-related sexual vi olence, arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and ill-
treatment, forced milit ary recruitment  and the looting and d estruction of civilian 
property by civil def ense groups, go vernment forces, and  rebel forces. 
In June, the UN reported  that more than 80 percent  of civi lian casualties in the 
country were attributed to intercommunal violence and community-based mili-tias. Intercommunal fighting, cattle r aiding, and revenge attacks between armed 
youth groups in 
Central Equatoria , the Greater Pibor Administr ative Area (GPAA)  
in Jonglei, Lakes, Unity, Western Bahr el-Ghazal and Warrap states resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries, displaced  hundreds of thousands, and led to 
the suspension of humanitarian services in some areas.  
In Upper Nile, tensions over the status of Malakal town persisted. On March 27 , 
members of the internally displaced community, many residents of the town’s protection of civilian si te, were attacked 
by suspected Dinka Padang militia  in 
Malakal town as they travelled to meet the newly appointed Shilluk governor. Four civili ans died and  7 were injured in the attack.  
In Jonglei, intercommunal violence displaced about 20,000 people in the 
Greater 
Pibor Administrative Area  with an estimated 68 people killed and 27 injured  in 
early May when allied Gawaar Nuer and Dinka from Ayod, Uror and Duk marched into the GPAA to retrieve cattle raided by the Murle.  
In 
Greater Equatoria , there was violenc e over land  rights, cattle migration and 
fighting took place between the government forces and the National Salvation Front (NAS) .  
In Tambura, Western Equatoria state, 
violence  broke out in June between govern-
ment forces, SPLA/IO forces and community militias, resulting in killing s of civil-
ians. The violence di splaced appr oximately 80,000 civili ans, including into 
neighbouring count ries, and h ampered humanit arian assist ance. 
Violence against Women and Girls  
Sexual violence, including c onflict-related sexual vi olence, against women and 
girls has been widespread  and an ongoing problem in South Sudan. Between 
late 2020 and late July 2021, UNMISS  documented  48 incidents of conflict-re-
lated sexual violence, primarily by c ommunity militias and government forces, 
608WORLD REPORT 2022including rape, gang rape, forced nudity, and attempted rape, of victims as 
young as 2.  
Impunity remained widespread, with only a handful of cases of security forces 
being tried  for sexual vio lence related crimes in front of military co urt or in civil-
ian trials.    
Child marriage remains widespread. In late 2020, United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF) reported  that more than half (52 percent) of South Sudanese girls 
between the ages of 15 and 18 are married, with some marrying as young as age 12. 
South Sudan’s Penal Code Act of 2008 criminalizes consensual same-sex con-
duct, for both women and f or men. Article 248 entitled “Unna tural Offenc es,” 
outlaws “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” with up to 10 years’ im-
prisonment and stipulates that such “may also be liable to a fine.” The code also 
criminalizes sex work . 
Attacks on Aid Workers  
Aid workers continued to be attacked,  hampering greatly needed aid efforts, 
with the UN warning  that South Sudan was bec oming one of the m ost dangerous 
places for humanitarian workers to operate.  
In January, a hum anitarian w orker was shot dead  while returning from his work 
supporting vulnerable families near Bentiu. In February, a group of unknown 
gunmen attacked a humanitarian vehicle carrying polio vaccines between Rum-
bek Centre to Rumbek North in Lake state killing three health workers  and injur-
ing four others.  
In April, staff from a UN agency and a national nongovernmental organization 
(NGO) were physically assaulted  by youth in separate incidents in Torit town, 
Eastern Equatoria. In Jamjang in Ruw eng Administrative Area, youth entered  an 
International Rescue Committee (IRC) compound  and physically attacked staff, 
resulting in multiple injuries.  
In May, a female aid worker from Cordaid was shot dead  in Budi County, Eastern 
Equatoria state. On May 21, Dr. Louis Edward, an IRC health worker died inside a health facility in Ganyliel Payam, Panyijiar County, in 
“unclear circumstances.”  
609HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHArbitrary Detentions, Freedom of Media  
Security forces, notably the National Security Service (NSS), continued to repress 
dissent. In response to calls for peaceful protests by the People’s Coalition for Civic Action, a civic action group, the authorities 
detained  political activists 
throughout August, shut down the SUDD instit ute—a think tank linked to the 
coalition—ha rassed the press and threatened to use live ammunition against 
protesters. The authorities detained  Kuel Aguer, a leader of the People’s Coali-
tion for Civic Action, on August 2  and he remained in detention in Juba at time of 
writing . On August 27 , NSS shut down  Radio Jonglei FM, and briefly detained  
three media workers on accusations of supporting the People’s Coalition for Civil 
Action activities.  
On the eve of the planned protest, the government shut down internet across 
Juba and its subu rbs for a day.  
On August 30, the NSS detained  three act ivists in Wau, Western Bahr el-Ghazal, 
for allegedly meeting and planning demonstrations. 
In February, Amnesty International reported on  the government’s  abusive physi-
cal and communications’ surveillance capacity and how it is being deployed without safeguard s, creating a per vasive c limate of fear and self -censorship 
among citizens.  
Impunity 
In late January, the cabinet approved the implementation of the Chapter V ac-countability mechanisms provided for in the 2018 peace agreement, including 
the establis hment of the Hybrid  Court for South Sudan, a Commiss ion for Truth, 
Reconciliation and Healing, and a Compensation and Reparations Authority. While in May the government 
established  a committee to conduct consultations 
around the en abling legisl ation for the truth commiss ion, at time of writing, the 
government had taken no concrete  steps to operationalize the hybrid court. 
Between April and June, on the orders of the Warrap state governor, security 
forces executed  at least 21 people accused of  murder, theft, and other offenses, 
including in the towns of Kuajok, Romic, Al abek, Twic, Aliek, and Warrap. This in-
cluded the summary execution of at l east eight suspected criminals, including 
610WORLD REPORT 2022two children, in Kuajok and Nyang Akoch. UNMISS also  documented  the execu-
tions of 29 males in the state, including boys and elderly men. 
In September, the UN C ommiss ion on Human Rights  in South Sudan reported  
that South Sudanese political elites had  diverted US$73 million since 2018, un-dermining the promotion of key  rights and directly contributing to ongoing con-flict. The Comm ission noted that the gov ernment deliber ately limited 
independent oversight of oil revenues to facilitate the misappropriation of public 
funds.  
On April 10 President Kiir, with apparent disregard for the many crimes commit-
ted by the NSS, 
promoted  one of its top officials, Akol Koor Kuc, to the rank of 
First Lieutenant General. In the same reshuffle, Kiir appointed Santino Deng Wol , 
a man sanctioned by the UN for his role in a May 2015 off ensive  in Unity State , 
during which government forces killed do zens of women, children, and older 
people, and looted  civili an property, as the new army chief of  staff.  
Key International Actors 
In March, the UN Security Council renewed  the mandate of UNMISS for another 
year with demands that parties to conflict immediately end fighting, launch a po-litical dialogue, implement permanent ceasefire. That same month, the UN Human Rights Council, following a close vote, 
renewed  the mandate of the Com-
mission on Human Rights in South Sudan, for another year.  
In May, the UN Security Council renewed the arms embargo , travel ban and as-
sets freeze imposed on South Sudan f or another year and extended for 13 
months the mandate of the panel of experts, despite gov ernment lo bbying 
against the renewal . The resolution requires  South Sudan to achieve progress on 
five key benchmarks including: progre ss on disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration; progress on properly managing existing arms and ammunition 
stockpiles; and the implementation of the Joint Action Plan for the Armed Forces on addressing conflict-related  sexual violence.  
UNMISS 
continued to handover protection of civilian si tes to the government, 
with the handover of Bentiu in March. Malakal retained its status as a result of “
a volatile security situation.”   
611HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn March, the European Union sanctioned  South Sudan Army Gen. Gabriel Moses 
Lokujo  over human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions and 
killings, in connection with his defection from the SPLA/IO to the government forces. The United States extended its recognition of a state of emergency for South Sudan, thereby 
extending related sanctions . 
The African Union Comm ission (AUC) has a responsibility u nder the 2018 peace 
agreement to establish the Hybrid Court for South Sudan, but it faile d to move 
ahead  with the court’s creation or press for greater action by South Sudanese 
authorities to establish the court together with the AUC. 
612WORLD REPORT 2022Spain 
Spain pushed migrants and asylum seekers back at its borders while hundreds 
died at sea attempting to reach the Canary Islands. As poverty increased with 
the Covid-19 pandemic, people faced obst acles applying for a new social secu-
rity support scheme. The government announced legislative reforms to counter gender-based violence and allow f or gender self-recognition for trans people. 
The government granted partial par dons for nine po liticians and act ivists con-
victed for their actions during the disputed 2017 referendum on Catalan inde-pendence. 
Covid-19  
The World Health Organization estimated  that a further 32,902 people had died 
from Covid-19 by November 4, bringing the total death toll to 87 ,462. A nation-wide vaccination program had ensured that 88.7 percent of the population had 
received a full dose  of Covid-19 vaccine by November 4. 
In July, the Supreme Court ruled that  the government’s March 2020 decree im-
posing a “state of alarm” to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic had unconstitu-tionally restricted fundamental rights and  that the government should have 
sought parliamentary approval to declare a state of emergency instead. The “state of alarm” expired in May. 
Migrants and Asylum Seekers  
According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR , by October 31, at least 33,706 peo-
ple had arrived irregularly by sea to Spain’s  mainland, the Canary Islands, in the 
Atlantic Ocean, and Ceuta and Melilla, the country’s enclaves in north Africa, while 1,068 arrived by land. These figures did not include data regarding the ar-rivals from May 17 onwards into Ceuta (see below). As of mid-September, an 
esti-
mated  1,025  people had died or gone missing at sea during the year en route to 
Spain, most of them in the Atlantic, acco rding to the International Organization 
for Migration.  
In April, four UN special rapporteurs wrote  to the Spanish government about 
abusive pushbacks from its enclaves to  Morocco, fol lowing fresh al legations of 
613HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHill-treatment by Spanish border guards in January. Nonetheless, there were re-
ports of summary returns throughout the year, and the governing coalition did not endorse reforming existing law allowing for this practice. 
Between May 17 and 19, an estimated  10,000 people entered Ceuta, swimming 
or wading across a beach frontier, after Moroccan authorities reportedly stopped 
enforcing border controls following a dip lomatic dispute with Spain. The group, 
of whom between 1,500 and 3,000 were estimat ed to be children, faced sum-
mary returns and pushbacks upon arriva l as well as mass “vol untary” returns 
within days, giving rise to concerns that Spanish authorities blocked access to asylum, returned third country nationals to Morocco, and failed to determine 
children’s best interests before sending them back. Ceuta’s already overcrowded 
reception facilities were overwhelmed by those whom the Spanish authorities did not immediately expel, with local authorities setting up makes hift shelters, 
including for the more than 7 00 children who remained. Thousands of other mi-
grants were left sleeping rough in substandard conditions. 
On August 13, the Spanish government began returning some of the children to 
Morocco under a readmission agreement; the nation al human rights  ombudsper-
son immediately 
told the government to  stop what it  called an unla wful practice. 
Media documented  that more children were returned despite the ombudsper-
son’s ruling, during the following two days, until a local court ordered  a stop to 
further returns on August 16. 
In September, Spanish armed forces stationed on another military outpost in 
North Africa, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, summarily returned  approximately 
125 people, including eight children, who had walked across a small strip of 
sand connecting it to Moroccan territory. 
The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child set out concerns in two cases, 
made public in February  and August , about the inappropriatene ss of processes 
used by Spanish authorities to det ermine the age of unaccompanied migrant 
and asylum-seeking children and young people.  
In June, the national human rights ombudsperson called  on the government to 
improve access to residence permits for young people who had been given tem-porary authorization to work in the agri cultural sector during the pandemic. In 
October, the government 
approved  a decree tabled by the Ministry of Inclusion, 
614WORLD REPORT 2022Social Security and Migration setting out a cle ar legal pathway for approximately 
15,000 young migrants to obtain residence permits after turning 18.  
Spanish forces airlifted 2,206 Afghans to Spain in August following the Taliban 
takeover in Afghanistan and set up a reception hub through which approximately 
3,000 more evacuees  passed to other EU and NATO member states. Despite 
these efforts, at least a few dozen Af ghan interpreters and other staff who had 
assisted Spanish forces remained stranded  after formal evacuation efforts 
ended.

A leading anti-poverty NGO calculated  that 620,000 people joined the 12.5 mil-
lion people already “at risk of poverty or social exclusion” in the country, with the first annual increase after five years of steady decline, and found that by the end of 2020, 4.5 million people in Spain were 
living in extreme poverty  (defined 
as below 40 per cent of median national income, or less than €6,417.30 (US$7 ,423) per household per year).  
Although the country’s Minimum Vital Income scheme (IMV), established in May 
2020 to provide financial support to people living in poverty helped mitigate the increase, people making applications faced bureaucratic 
delays  and exclusion-
ary criteria . Some welfare advisers estimated  in February that two out of three 
applications for IMV support were reject ed. Spain’s main food bank network esti-
mated  in February that  it was prov iding up to 60 percent mor e aid than in 2020.  
Right to Housing  
Despite a government decree allowing tenants with documented “economic vul-
nerability” to apply for t emporary relief from evictions and utility cut-offs, official 
data showed that 22,532 evictions were carried out during the first eight months of the year, the majority for non-payment of rent. 
In two separate cases communicated in March, the UN Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights found that  Spain had violated  the housing rights of 
families living in poverty, with a child or children with disabilities, and facing 
eviction. 
615HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn July, a Barcelona court acquitted three hous ing rights act ivists of charges re-
lated to protests against an eviction in 2018. The prosecution had sought three-
year jail sentences, which were widely criticized as a punitive response to lawful protest, including in a joint letter by four UN special rapporteurs. 
At time of writing, an estimated 4,000 people, including more than 1,500 chil-
dren, living in parts of Cañada Real,  an informal settlement in greater Madrid, 
had been without electricity after authorities and energy providers cut off the supply in Oc tober 2020, c iting illegal  use. They faced a sec ond succe ssive w inter 
without heat or electricity. 
Gender-Based Violence 
Draft legislation  introduced by the government in July providing a clearer defini-
tion of consent and a right to reparation  for victims of gender-based violence, 
among other m easures, was befor e parliament at  time of writing. 
In September, the Supreme Court issued  important guidance, with 27 clear rules 
for courts, on domestic abuse and threa tening behavior, based on a case that 
came before it from Galicia. 
Abortion 
According to official statistics, 6 of  Spain’s 19 autonomous communities and 
cities had no public health facilities providing abortion. Serious concerns re-mained about conscientious objection by health workers acting as an obstacle to women who needed abortion care. 
Right to Education 
By April, Spain had managed  to ensure greater access to in-person education  
during the Covid-19 pandemic than any comparable OECD country. 
In September, local authorities in Melilla allowed some 160 children from fami-
lies without regular migration status , or unable to provide documentary evidence 
of residence, to enroll for school. The step came following years of campaigning 
by local chi ldren’s rights activis ts about the difficulties ch ildren from families 
with Moroccan nationality or of Moroccan origin faced in enrolling children for 
616WORLD REPORT 2022school, repeated recommendations  from the national human rights ombudsper-
son, and a ruling  by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in June. 
Disability Rights 
In June, parliament adopted a legal capacity reform law , providing for mecha-
nisms to support people  with disabilities to ma ke decisions for themselves, 
such as whether to marry or to sign a contract. However, the law did not com-pletely abolish substitute decision ma king and courts can continue to appoint 
another person to make decisions on behalf of  a person with a disability. 
Discrimination and Intolerance  
In February, Europe an Comm ission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), the 
Council of Europe’s anti-racism monitoring body, called on  the Spanish govern-
ment to take concrete steps to end the segregation of Roma children in schools. 
In March, the Ministry for Equality published  Spain’s first official report  on the 
experience  of African and Afro-descendant  people, which showed strong evi-
dence of structural disc rimination  against Black people in the country.  
In May, the lower house of parliament rejected  a bill that would have allowed for 
legal gender recognition based on self-identification for transgender and non-bi-nary people, including children. At the time of writing, the government was 
preparing a new draft law to address Spain’s current pathologizing gender recog-
nition procedure and expand protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen-
der (LGBT) people.   
Disputed 2017 Catalan Independence Referendum 
In June, the government granted  conditional pardons to nine pro-independence 
Catalan po liticians and  activis ts jailed  for their role in relation to the region’s 
disputed 2017 referendum.  
Freedom of Expression 
The European Court of Human Rights ruled in unrelated cases, in March  and June  
respectively, that Spain had violated the right to free expression of three ac-
617HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtivis ts. The first case invo lved two envi ronmental act ivists in Aragon conv icted of 
insulting a judge in a 2010 letter to a newspaper editor, and the second a Basque act ivist convicted of  glorification of terrori sm and incitement  to hatred 
and violence during a 2008 speech. 
Law Enforcement and Police Abuse 
In November, the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture  
published a report  documenting physical ill-treatment, including slaps, 
punches, and baton blows, and a systemic  failure to document, report and in-
vestigate allegations of ill-treatment in police custody and prisons. The Commit-tee also found that falaka, a torture method  involving baton blows to the soles of 
the feet, continued to be used in prisons, and called on Spain to abolish the use of incommunicado detention. 
The same month, media reports indicated that the governing coalition 
had 
reached an agreement  to amend a problematic 2015 public security law, lifting or 
mitigating restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly and curtailing po-
lice powers  relating to detention and the use of rubber bullets. 
618WORLD REPORT 2022Sri Lanka 
In March 2021, the UN Human Rights Council, responding to continuing abuses 
and the failure of accountability in Sri Lanka, mandated  the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to collect and prepare evidence of grave crimes 
for use in future prosecutions.  
Under the administration of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lankan security 
forces harassed and threatened hum an rights defenders, journalists, lawyers 
and the families of victims of past abus es, while suppressing peaceful protests. 
The government continued to target mem bers of the Tamil and Muslim minority 
communities using the country’s overbroad counterterrorism law, and policies that threaten religious fr eedom and minority land rights.  
In June, President Rajapaksa 
pardoned  16 people convicted under the draconian 
Prevention of Terrorism Act. However, all those pardoned were either nearing the end of their sentences or had already exceeded their term. The president also pardoned political ally Duminda Silv a, who had been convicted for the 2011 mur-
der of a rival politician. 
The country struggled to cope with surging Covid-19 cases, which contributed to 
widespread economic distress, but a response to the pandemic under military control led to further serious rights violations. 
Accountability and Justice  
UN Human Rights Council Resolution 46/1,  adopted on March 23, strengthens 
the capacity of  the Office of the UN High Comm issioner for Human Rights to col-
lect, consolidate, analyze, and preserve  evidence of international crimes com-
mitted in Sri Lanka, and to develop stra tegies for future accountability 
processes. Numerous grave abuses we re committed by both sides during the 26-
year civil war,  which ended in 2009, and by the gov ernment in its aftermath.  
After Rajapaksa’s election in November 2019, he withdrew Sri Lanka from a 2015 
council resolution agreed by the previous government to promote truth, justice, 
and reconciliation. Rajapaksa said he wo uld not tolerate any action against “war 
heroes” and instead appointed several officia ls implicated in war crimes to his

Lanka remains in a state of denial about the past, with truth-seeking efforts aborted.” 
In January, the cabinet approved the recommendations of the 
Commission of In-
quiry to Investigate Allegations of Political Victimization , which President Ra-
japaksa set up to  derail criminal investigations  into abuses. These included 
cases  in which evidence implicates the president himself. A resolution to imple-
ment the comm ission’s  recommendations  is before parliament. 
Presidential appointments severely undermined the independence of human 
rights instit utions, including the Office of  Missing Pe rsons, which is responsible 
for investigating thousands of  enforced disappearances. The Global Alliance of 
National Human Rights Institutions is reviewing the status of the Human Rights Commiss ion of Sri Lanka after its independenc e was removed by a constit utional 
amendment  in 2020.  
Attacks on Human Rights Defenders  
The government  continued to  harass, threaten  and surveil  victims’ families , as 
well as lawyers and groups  representing them. Intelligenc e agencies and the mil-
itary interfere in the work  of civil soc iety organiz ations, particularly in the north 
and east, and suppress perceived dissent. Human rights organizations reported regular visits to their offices by secu rity agencies including the police Terrorism 
Investigation Divis ion. The government  attempted to disr upt foreign funding of 
rights groups on the pretext of  countering “terrorist financing.” 
Counterterrorism Laws  
The Prevention of Terrorism Act  (PTA) has for decades been used to enable  pro-
longed arbitrary detention and torture. In 2021, President Rajapaksa issued two ordinances th at would make the law more a busive.  
An order issued in 
March , which has been challenged  in the Supreme Court, 
would allow two years of “rehabi litation” detention without trial for anyone ac-
cused by the authorities of causing “religious, racial, or communal 
621HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHdisharmony.” In June, the president  announced  that a police facility in Colombo 
would become an additional site for holding PTA prisoners. 
Many prisoners, especially from minority c ommunities, remain in pretrial deten-
tion lasting many years under the PTA, or are serving lengthy terms following convictions based on confessions obtained using torture. In August, Inspector General of Police C.D. Wickramaratne 
said  that 311 people were in custody, under 
investigation, or awaiting trial for the deadly  2019 Easter bombings that killed 
over 250 people.  
Freedom of Expression and Association  
The government suppressed freedom of expression, including by detaining and interrogating 
journalists . The government introduced regulations  to prevent 
sharing information related to the pandemic. The  Bar Association of Sri 
Lanka  said police orders to combat “fake news” “could be misused by police of-
ficers in order to stifle the freedom of speech and expression.” 
In February, authorities attempted to ban a protest march  by Tamil conflict vic-
tims, act ivists, and others. Nu merous participants were  arrested or harassed by 
police or intelligence agencies.  
In July, trade u nionists, act ivists, and teachers were ar rested during a protest in 
Colombo against legislation they said would militarize higher education and were 
detained  at quarantine facilities after being granted  bail by a magistrate. In 
August, police arrested  trade unionists and students are protesting the bill. 
Deaths in Custody  
The police were implicated  in several  unlawful  deaths , including three men 
whose deaths in May  and June were  linked to disproportion ate and a busive en-
forcement of measures to control Covid-19. Other cases were linked to an abu-
sive anti-drugs policy . After two suspects were shot  dead in police custody in 
May, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka  said the cases “have all the hallmarks of 
extra-judicial killings.” 
622WORLD REPORT 2022Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Same-sex relations are criminalized in Sri Lanka, and a law banning “imperson-
ation” is used to target transgender people. Authorities use these powers to ha-
rass, detain, and extort gay, lesbian and transgender people, who also face societal discrimination. 
Labor Rights  
The government ordered  garment factories, which employ one in seven Sri 
Lankan women, to remain open when most other parts of the economy were shut 
down to control the spread of Covid-19. Outbreaks  were reported at numerous 
factories, as well as in the congested boar ding houses where many workers live. 
Labor rights activis ts alleged  that employers were under-testing and under-re-
porting cases to maintain production levels. G arment workers reported lost pay 
and benefits when they fell sick or needed to quarantine, and that the police or military personnel intimidated them to  stop them from speaking out. 
Women’s Rights 
The cabinet approved reforms to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) to 
make 18 the minimum age for marriage, ens ure women sign their marriage regis-
tration certificates, ban polygamy, and end the Quazi system of male-only judges 
in Islamic family courts. However, the pr oposed reforms were not published, nor 
presented to parliament.  
Key International Actors  
UN High Comm issioner for Hum an Rights Michel le Bachelet warned  of “clear 
early warning signs of a deteriorating human rights situation,” and called upon UN member countries to consider impos ing targeted sanctions against alleged 
perpetrators, and to pursue prosecutions in national courts under universal juris-diction. A group of nine UN rights experts 
wrote  to urge “the Sri Lankan authori-
ties to stop rolling back hard fought  progress made in recent years.” 
The core group on Sri Lanka (the UK, Canada, Germany, Montenegro, North 
Macedonia, Malawi) at the Human Rights Council successfully led the adoption 
623HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHof Resolution 46/1 , which established an international evidence-gathering 
mechanism, which has now been establis hed as the OHCHR Sri Lanka Accounta-
bility Project . Among Sri Lanka’s key trading partners, India and Japan ab-
stained, while China opposed the resolution. 
In June, the European Parliament passed a resolution  calling upon the European 
Union to ensure Sri Lanka abides by its human rights commitments under the 
GSP+ program . However, the EU, like other fo reign partners including the United 
States, Australi a, and the United  Kingdom, was r eluctant to publicly call upon 
the Sri Lankan government to end abuses. 
624WORLD REPORT 2022Sudan 
The second year of Sudan’s democr atic trans ition has been marred by political 
instability that slowed the pace of rights and rule of law reforms, and a dire eco-
nomic situation that compounded public discontent. The government failed to implement key institutional and law reforms  stipulated in the August 2019 con-
stitutional charter, including the establishment of a transitional legislative coun-cil and commissions with mandates to address peace, transitional justice, and corruption. In June, in response to growing criticism, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok 
outlined  plans to tackle the “national  political crisi s,” with an emp hasis 
on the need for security sector reform. On September 21, authorities announced 
that a coup attempt  had been quashed in Khartoum, and the prime minister said 
officers affiliated with former President Om ar al-Bashir’s regime were involved.  
Notwithstanding progress in eight cases implicating government forces in 
killings of protesters, justice for serious government abuses  has been largely 
lacking due to broad immunities, an apparent lack of commitment to pursue these cases, limited resources, and the ab sence of clear prosecution strategies. 
Government officials reaffirmed their previously expressed commitment to coop-erate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Cabinet of Ministers
 
agreed  in June to hand over suspects to the court. However, the cabinet and Sov-
ereign Council, which include s military leader s, has to  consider the de cision at a 
joint meeting which has yet to be scheduled. It was unclear whether the Sover-
eign Council would approve the transfers despite the government’s international obligation to do so.  
Despite the government’s commitment to prot ect civi lians in Darfur after the de-
parture of the United Nations-African Union hybrid peacekeeping operation (UN-AMID) in December 2020, violence in Darfur continued, with a notable increase in West Darfur. There have  been killings and widespread  displacement  of civil-
ians, as well as dest ruction of civili an property. In 2020, the United Nations  Se-
curity Counci l established the UN Integrat ed Transition Assist ance M ission 
(UNITAMS ), a nationw ide mission tasked to support Sudan’s politic al transition 
and has no m andate to provide physical protection. 
Security sector reforms, such as vetting and  removal of suspected perpetrators 
from security apparatuses, failed to move forward. Pr ogress in the implementa-
625HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtion of the Juba Peace Agreement, signed in October 2020, between the govern-
ment and multiple rebel groups, notably the integration of rebel forces into the 
government forc es and the f ormation of j oint forces for Da rfur, has been slow.  
As a result of conflict in Ethiopi a’s Tigray and Amhara regions, over 55,000  
Ethiopians fled to eastern Sudan as of August 2021.  
On October 25, the military leaders of the transitional government carried out a 
coup, arresting civili an officials and  dissolv ing the transition al gov ernment. Pro-
testers took to the streets rejecting the coup, and security forces responded vio-lently with lethal force, detaining protesters  and political leaders, as well cutting 
off internet for almost 3 weeks.  
On November 21, a 
deal  was s igned between now reinsta ted prime minister and 
the military, allowing the first to be rel eased from his house arrest and to form a 
new technocratic go vernment, The deal  was rejected by pr otesters and other po-
litical groups. 
Conflict, Abuses in Darfur and Eastern Sudan 
In January, armed Arab militias launched attacks against internally displaced 
people from the Massalit and other Afric an ethnic groups, in al-Genaina, the 
capital of west Darfur, killing around 150 people.  
Between April 4-8, another cy cle of attac ks in al-Genaina kil led over 120 civilians 
according to local doctors, displac ed thousands, and  left thousands of civi lian 
homes destroyed. Some government forces sided with armed assailants while others failed to intervene. According to the UN, 
65,000 people were displaced by 
the fighting , with around 2,000 fleeing into neighboring Chad .  
In May, the Red Sea state in Eastern Sudan witnessed another bout of intercom-
munal violence  which left around five dead and 13 wounded according to state 
media. 
Ongoing Crackdowns on Protesters 
Groups organized protests in Khar toum and other towns against the poor eco-
nomic situation and  delayed ref orms. On June 30, po lice used te ar gas to  dis-
perse protests against economic reforms that led to high prices. 
626WORLD REPORT 2022On May 11, 2021, Sudan armed forces used excessive  and leth al force against 
peaceful protesters  gathered in Khartoum leading to 2 deaths. The protests were 
to commemorate the victims of the deadly crackdown against  the June 3 sit-in  in 
Khartoum in 2019. After the reported  arrest of 99 army soldiers, at least 7 of 
whom were charged, the army handed ov er investigation findings to the then at-
torney-general. If any further steps have been taken, they have not been made public. 
Security forces 
killed  a student in Zalingei, South Darfur, on September 1, during 
student protests against security forces’ refusal to hand over a vacated UNAMID facility, promised to the university. 
In response to anti-coup protests, Security forc es have repeatedly used exces-
sive forc e, including lethal  force, against demons trators. Forty -two people were 
killed in Khartoum between October 25 and November 21 including five children 
and one woman. Sixteen people were shot dead on 
November 17 , 2021, alone, 
including a woman and a child, the deadliest response to date. 
Accountability 
Despite ongoing calls for justice for serious crimes, accountability for atrocities 
was limited.  
According to the office of the attorney-general, eight cases  involving protester 
killings have been recommended to move to courts this year. At time of writing, there were two ongoing criminal trials in Khartoum and three in Atbara, Northern Sudan state, in which members of the security  forces are facing charges of mur-
der and crimes against humanity.  
In July, a court in White Nile state 
sentenced a police officer to death  for killing a 
child during December 2018 protests. Another court in August in the same state sentenced a police officer for killing a protester on December 21, 2018. On May 
24, a court in Khartoum 
sentenced  a Rapid Support Forces (RSF) officer to death 
for the June 3, 2019 ki lling of a 22-year old protester. A court in El-Obeid, South 
Kordofan sentenced  six RSF soldiers to death over the killing of four students 
during a protest in 2019 . 
The committee to investigate the violent dispersal of protests in Khartoum 
on June 3, in which more than 120 were killed , has not r eleased its  findings. Vic-
627HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtims’ families and activis ts have criticized this delay . The head of the committee 
said he requested technical support from the African Union (AU) to analyze video footage, but that the AU 
said it lacked  the necessary resources and expertise to 
assist .  
Media reported that over 150 bodies were discovered  in April in a morgue out-
side Khartou m, prompting act ivists and f amilies of m issing persons to raise con-
cerns over authorities’ attempt to obstruct justice and tamper with evidence.  
On May 24, ICC judges confirmed charges against Ali Mohamed  Ali (known as Ali 
Kosheib, also spelled Kushayb), a former Janjaweed leader who surrendered in 
2020. The court announced that his trial would begin on April 5, 2022. 
Four suspects sought by the ICC on charge s of genocide, war crimes and crimes 
against humanity  committed in Darfur , including ex-President al-Bashir, remain 
fugitives from the court, although three are currently in Sudanese custody. 
In June, then ICC pro secutor Fatou Bensouda visited Da rfur for the first time. In 
an August visi t, the new prosecutor, K arim A.A. Kh an, signed a new memoran-
dum of understanding with the authorities to facilitat e the prosecutor’s access 
to Sudan and ensure cooperation on all cases in which arrest warrants have been iss ued, following a memorandum th at was s igned specific ally f or coopera-
tion in the Kosheib case. That same month, the Cabinet of Ministers 
agreed  to 
handover the ICC suspects in custody, including ex-President al-Bashir, to the Hague. 
Al-Bashir also is 
currently standing trial in Sudan , alongside other 27 former offi-
cials, on charges of undermining the cons titutional order during the 1989 coup 
against Sudan’s last elected government. 
There has been no progre ss on the establi shment of the Darfur  special criminal 
court, which was provided for in the J uba Agreement, s igned in Octo ber 2020.  
Other Reforms  
On January 11, the former attorney-general issued an instruction  limiting the 
power to arrest and  detain civilians to  police and prosec ution and decl aring that 
arrests made by intel ligence or military forces wo uld be consider ed unlawful. 
628WORLD REPORT 2022This came after a detainee was killed  in RSF custody in December 2020, and ac-
tivists took  to the streets to  call for an end to RSF abuses. 
On February 23, at a joint meeting of the cabinet and Sovereign Council (serving 
as the legislative body in the absence of a transitional legislature) ratification of both the International Convention for the Prot ection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappear ance and the United  Nations Convention ag ainst Tor ture was 
ap-
proved .  
On April 24, the joint meeting approved laws on formation of peace , transitional 
justice, and anti-c orruption comm issions. 
The cabinet of ministers approved a law to ratify the Rome Statute of the ICC  on 
August 3. Ratification requires approval by the joint meeting to take effect.  
Unlawful Detention  
As the military moved with the coup, security forced rounded up  dozens in and 
out of Kh artoum, including at  least 30 civili an officials, who we re detained in 
undisclosed locations and with no access to family or lawyers. As part of the No-vember 21 deal, number of detainees were released. At least seven detainees, including a former minister, were charged with sedition and kept in detention, according to their families. 
Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity  
Sudan’s Criminal Act of 1991 in Article 148 continues to criminalize sodomy with punishment of up to life in prison, while Ar ticle 151 provides for up to a year in 
prison for “indecent acts,” including between women. 
Key International Actors  
On January 6, Sudan and the United States signed an agreement normalizing re-lations w ith Israel. Th is follows the decision by the US  to lift s anctions ag ainst 
Sudan in 2020. 
On May 17 , France 
hosted a donors conference  to support Sudan’s transition, at-
tended by heads of governments from the European Union, Gulf and African 
629HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHstates, as well international and region al financial institutions. Focused on the 
country’s economic  crisis, Sud an secured int ernational  contributions for debt re-
lief and for plans of future investments. 
In June, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) granted Sudan a $2.5 billion loan . 
In March, the IMF and World Bank approved Sudan’s request for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which requir ed the govern-
ment to adopt hard-hitting IMF-supervised 
economic reforms , including eliminat-
ing fuel subsidies and introducing exchange rate reform. 
AU-mediated talks on the filling and oper ation of the Gr and Ethiopian Renais-
sance Dam (GERD) between Egypt, Sud an, and Ethiopia in Kinshasa continued 
with no results. Sudan said the country would not join  any new AU-led negotia-

Council issued a statement in September encouraging Sudan and others to re-sume talks. 
630WORLD REPORT 2022Syria 
2021 marked a decade since the peaceful uprising in Syria turned into a brutal 
conflict. Since the start, parties to the conflict have flagrantly disregarded human rights and  humanitarian law protections. Hum an Rights Watch  has deter-
mined that some attacks by the Russia-Syri a alliance are war crimes and may 
amount to crimes against humanity.   
In May 2021, Bashar al-Assad secured a fourth term as president for seven more 
years in elections that did not occur under the auspices of the United Nations-led political process and failed to ad here to standards for free and fair elections. 
His renewed term as president came as his security services continued to sub-ject hundreds, including returning refugees, to  arbitrarily arrest and torture, 
while millions go hungry due to his government’s diversion of aid and failure to equitably  address a debilitating economic  crisis br ought on prim arily by the de-
struction of infrastructure and crises in neighboring countries. 
Routine shortages in basi c goods, including bread and fuel, have become com-
monplace and the number of people in need of h umanitarian assistanc e in-
creased by 21 percent in 2021—reaching a total of 13.4 million people, with 1.48 
million in “catastrophic” need, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). A little over 1 percent of the country’s total pop-ulation was fully vaccinated against Cov id-19 at time of writing, and there were 
concerns about the government’s ability to distribute vaccines equitably, even within ar eas u nder its control. 
According to World  Vision, by 2021 the economic to ll of the war was US$1.2 tril-
lion. The costs incurred are largely due to the destruction of infrastructure and massive displacement  caused by a decade of war using prohibite d tactics, pri-
marily by the Syrian-Russi an military alliance. Hum an Rights Watch  has deter-
mined that some attacks by the alliance are war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity. The US-led anti-ISIS coalition have also violated inter-
national humanitarian law, by conducting indiscriminate strikes in northeast Syria that resulted in civili an death and  destruction 
Prohibited attacks by the Syrian-Russian mi litary alliance continue to be used in

Following the territorial defeat of the Isl amic State (ISIS) in northeast Syria, Kur-

eign men, women, and children indefinitely held in dire conditions in closed 
camps and prisons as ISIS suspects and family members. 
The UN Security Council failed to renew the full cross-border aid mechanism, 
leaving only one border crossing open and exacerbating humanitarian crises in non-government areas. Meanwhile, the UN-led pe ace process continued to stag-
nate.  
Despite the government’s record of human rights abuses against its own citi-
zens, this year also saw several countries normalize with the Syrian government, including the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, and make commitments to coop-erate, leading to concerns about premature return of refugees and potential fa-
cilitation of rights abuse.  
Abuses by the Syrian-Russian Military Alliance 
While all sides to the conflict have committed heinous laws-of-war violations, 
the Syrian-Russi an military allianc e has c onducted indisc riminate aeri al bomb-
ing of schools, hospital s, and markets—the civilian infrastructur e essential to a 
society’s su rvival. Acco rding to Airwars, a UK-ba sed monitoring grou p, the Russ-
ian air force alone has c arried out arou nd 39,000 airst rikes in Syria since 2015.  
Tensions between government loyalists and anti-government forces in Daraa 
governorate intensified in June 2021, following a popular rejection of the results of the Syrian presidential elections in May 2021. Between June and September 2021, Syrian armed forces, and affiliated militias launched dozens of indiscrimi-
nate attacks on populat ed areas in Daraa, while anti-gov ernment fighters also 
attacked gov ernment-held ar eas le ading to civili an casualties.  
633HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHAn estimated 55,000 civilians in Dara al-Balad, an area  affiliated  with anti-gov-
ernment sentiment, were besieged and restrict ed from accessing bread, fuel, 
electricity, and healthcare servi ces. As a result of  the siege and clashes, at least 
38,000 were displaced to nearby areas. In September, a Russian-brokered recon-ciliation agreement was announced whic h mandated the entry of the Syrian gov-
ernment to these area s, and that  civili ans and oppos ition fighters s ign so-called 
reconciliation agreements to be allowed to stay. Dozens of Syrians who refused were transferred to  Idlib. Human Rights  Watch has previousl y documented how 
the guarantees provided within reconcili ation agreements fall short of providing 
necessary protections for Syrians. Fo llowing the agreement, a Syrian Arab Red 
Crescent (SARC) food  truck was allowed to enter the area for the first time in 
months.  
Economic Crisis and Rights Implications 
By 2021, Syria’s economic output shrunk by 60 percent, the national currency depreciated by 99 percent and more than 90 percent of the population live below the poverty line according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Human-
itarian Affairs (OCHA). At least 12.4 million Syrians—out of an estimated popula-
tion of around 16 million— are food insecure, according to the World Food 
Programme (WFP), an alarming increase of 3.1 million in one year. More than 600,000 children are chronically malnouris hed. The Syrian go vernment has ex-
acerbated the economic  crisis’ impact by failing to  fairly and adequately address 
bread and fuel shortages, instead al lowing discriminatory and inequitable distri-
bution.  
Residents also report severe electric ity cuts and  shortages. In ar eas re-taken by 
the government, the majority of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch still had their houses completely or partially d estroyed and could not afford to re-
build or renovate. The Sy rian government  provides no rec onstruction assist ance 
even years aft er the territory has been re-taken. As such, many residents ar e liv-
ing in makeshift tents, and boiling water f or drinking. They are unable to afford 
rent elsewhere.  
In reclaimed parts of Idlib and Hama, Syrian authorities, through pro-govern-
ment militias and the gov ernment-control led “Peas ants’ Unions,” unlawfully 
634WORLD REPORT 2022confiscated the homes and lands of Syri ans who fled Syrian-Russian military at-
tacks and are selling them through auctions.  
In February 2021, Col. Elias al-Bitar, head of the army’s Exemptions and Reserves 
Branch, reminded the country of a late 2019 amendment to the conscription law that allows authorities to seize property of “military evaders” who fail to pay ab-surdly high fines. 
Obstacles to Humanitaria n Aid and Reconstruction  
At least 13.1 million Syrians need  humanitarian aid across Syria. 
Millions in northeast and northwest Syri a rely on the cross-border flow of food, 
medicine, and other lifesav ing assistanc e—including the Covid-1 9 vaccine. Aid 
workers told Human Rights Watch that  non-UN agencies have nowhere near the 
UN’s capacity to buy supplies and transport them into the northwest. They said that shutting down UN aid supplies and  ending UN funding would deny aid to 
millions of people.  
Non-UN aid groups in northeast Syria, which is mostly under the control of the 
Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration, a quasi-autonomous authority, say 
they have been unable to bring in enough aid, particularly for health care, since the UN was forced to  stop its c ross-border oper ations between Ir aq and Syria in 
January 2020. 
In July 2021, the UN Security Counci l renewed its authorization for cross-border 
humanitarian aid through the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkey to northwest Syria, the only re maining c ross-border aid corridor which has not  yet been barred 
by Russia’s UNSC veto power. 
As of September 2021, 610,257 Covid-19 vaccine doses had been administered 
in Syria including 119,158 doses in the nor thwest and 19,354 in the northeast. 
Around 3 percent of Syria’s total population were able to receive the vaccine.  
The Syrian government continued to impose severe restrictions on the delivery of 
humanitarian aid  in government -held ar eas of Syria and elsewhere in the coun-
try, and to divert aid to punish those who express dissent.  
In 2021, it imposed a siege on the city of Daraa al-Balad, preventing humanitar-
ian agencies from accessing the area and  severely restricting food, aid and med-
ical supplies. The Syrian government continue s to bar access to al-Rukban camp 
near the Jordanian border where the last UN humanitarian aid delivery took 
place in September 2019. 
635HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHArbitrary Detentions, Torture, Extrajudicial Executions, 
Enforced Disappearances  
Syrian security forces and government-a ffiliated militias continue to arbitrarily 
detain, disappear, and mistreat people across the country, including children, 
people with disabilities and  older people, and returnees and individuals in re-
taken areas who have signed so-called reconc iliation agreements. 
Human Rights Wa tch has docu mented 21 cases of arrest  and arbitra ry detention 
including 13 cases of torture, 3 kidnapping s, 5 extrajudicial killings, and 17 en-
forced disappearances between 2017 and 2021 among refugees who had re-turned to Syria from Jordan and Lebanon.  
On November 4, 2020, the Syrian government  released 60 individuals from de-
tention facilities in southern Syria and Damas cus. However, thousands remain 
locked away in Syria’s secretive detention system, many held from as far back as 
2011, and with no clue as to their whereabouts. 
According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), nearly 15,000 have 
died due to torture since March 2011, the majority at the hands of Syrian govern-ment forces.  The network also estimates that at least 100,000 Syrians remain forcibly disap-peared, with nearly 85 percent at the h ands of Syrian government forces. The UN 
Commiss ion of Inquiry (COI) was also able to document  cases of se xual violence 
inflicted during detention in government fa cilities, including rape, assault, and 
sexual humiliation against women, men, and girls and boys as young as 11 years 
old.  
On October 21, the Syrian Ministry of Justice announced the execution of 24 indi-
viduals, and gave five minors sentences between 10-12 years, for involvement in 
setting wild fires in Syria last year. The government  justified the decis ion under 
its overbroad and abusive Counterterrorism Law of 2019. 
Women’s Rights 
Women continue to face discrimination in relation to marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance under the Personal Status Law. A woman loses her right 
to financial maintenance from her husband if she refuses to live with her hus-
636WORLD REPORT 2022band in the marital home without a legitimat e excuse or if she works outside the 
marital home without her h usband’s perm ission.” While authorities amended 
the law twice in 2019 removing the language of “disobedience”, the law still punishes women for some acts of disobedience relating to mobility.  
While the authorities in 2020 repealed Artic le 548 of the penal code which al-
lowed men to receive  reduced sentenc es if they  injured or kil led their wives or 
immediate female relatives on finding them engaging in an “illegitimate” sexual 
act, other articles remain that could allo w men to receive reduced sentences for 
violence against women. The Penal Code al so criminalizes adultery in a manner 
that discriminates against women and provides a longer prison sentence for adultery for women than men. 
Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity 
Syrian state and non-state actors have subjected men, boys, transgender 
women, and nonbinary people to sexual  violence during the Syrian conflict, re-
sulting in severe physical and mental health consequences. Under Article 520 of 
the Syrian penal code, “unna tural sexual intercourse” is puni shable by three 
years in prison.  
Violations by Turkey and Turkish-Backed Forces 
Turkey invaded and occupied parts of  northeastern Syria in October 2019, where 
it remains in control. In the immediate aft ermath, many homes and private prop-
erties held by the local Kurdish population were looted and seized. By December 2019, Turkish authorities and an armed grou p affiliated with the Turkish-backed 
anti-government group—the Syrian National Arm y (SNA)—arrested and illegally 
transferred at least 63 Syrian nationals from northeast Syria to Turkey to face trial 
on serious charges that could lead to lif e in prison. Five of the 63 Syrians were 
sentenced to life in prison in October 2020.  
In the first half of 2021, the SNA arbitrarily detained 162 individuals, according to 
the Syrian Network for Human Rights.  
SNA factions continue to recruit children; a 2 021 Syrians for Truth and Justice re-
port found at least 20 cases of child recruitment. 
637HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHViolations by Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham, and Other  
Anti-Government Groups  
Anti-government  groups in Syria continue to re sort to abusive  detention prac-
tices in ar eas u nder their control. In Id lib, Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Al-
Qaeda affiliate, continues to raid and  arbitrarily  detain act ivists, hum anitarian 
workers, and  civilians voicing c ritical opinions.  
According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, during the first half of 2021, 
HTS arbitrarily arrested at least 57 individuals. According to local sources, in some cases. HTS imposes the death penalty on detainees.  
The group is increas ingly interfering in ev ery aspect of civili an life, limiting 
women’s movements, imposing d ress codes and even hair styles, and levying 
taxes and fines haphazardl y. It has al so seized many  homes and pr operties held 
by Christians.  
The number of child soldiers recruited by HTS increased from 61 cases to 187 
cases in the first half of 2020, according to a 2021 UN report. 
On October 20, a bomb exploded on a military bus at a highly populated area in 
Damascus, killing 14 and wounding others. An insurgent group called Saraya Qa-sioun claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Violations by the Syrian Democratic Forces and  
US-Led Coalition 
The Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdis h-led armed group, has c arried out  mass 
arrest campaigns ag ainst civili ans including act ivists, journalists, and teachers. 
In the first half of 2021, the SDF arbitrarily detained 369 individuals, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.  
More than 60,000 men, women and chi ldren remain detained in degrading, arbi-
trary, and often inhuman and lif e-threatening conditions by regional authorities 
in northeast Syria. They include nearly 43,000 foreigners—27 ,000 of them chil-dren—from nearly 60 countries who have  been held for more than two years 
without ever being brought before a court. On ly 25 countries are known to have 
repatriated or helped bring home any of their nationals and most of these have allowed only a limited number to return.  
638WORLD REPORT 2022Virtually no progre ss has been made by the Kurdish-led authorities or the US-led 
coalition to determine the fate of thousands disappeared by the Islamic State 
(also known as ISIS).  
Displacement Crisis  
The Syrian displac ement cr isis rem ains one of the m ost dire and pr otracted con-
sequences of the war. Since 2011, 12.3 million were forced to flee since the onset of the war, according to UNOCHA, with 6.7 million currently internally displaced across the country.  
In 2021, efforts to force refugees to return have taken on new dimensions. In 
March, Denmark became the first European country to inform 94 Syrian refugees 
that their “temporary protection” status will not be renewed after a flawed report 
by Danish immigration services claiming that Damascus, and Damascus country-side are safe for returns, notwithstanding amp le evidence that the risk of perse-
cution remains  pervasive. 
Despite a decrease in active hostilities in Syria, returnees faced a host of human 
rights violations, including arbitrary detention, torture, forced disappearances, and abuse by Syrian authorities, providing additional evidence that Syria is not safe. Returning refugees also faced extr eme economic hardship, unable to afford 
basic food items. Most also found their homes either totally or partially de-stroyed and were unable to afford the costs of renovation. The Syrian govern-
ment provided  no assistanc e in repairing homes. 
Schooling of refugee chi ldren, including children with disabilities, in refugee-
hosting countries was severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, par ticularly 
in Lebanon, where the problems posed by the pandemic are additionally com-
pounded by a severe political, financial, and  economic cr isis. There, hundreds of 
thousands of Syrian refugees faced heightened risks of dropouts, child labor, 
and child marriage.  
International Accountability Efforts  
In February 2021, a German court sentenced Eyad A., a former Syrian intelligence official, to four and a half years in prison for aiding and abetting crimes against 
639HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHhumanity. Th is was the first verdict in a historic trial of tw o former Syri an intelli-
gence officials, on charges related to state-sponsored torture in Syria. 
In March, the UN International, Independent, Impar tial Mechanism for Syria re-
ported that it has provided inform ation and evidence of  atrocity c rimes to 12 na-
tional jurisdictions. That month, Canada joined the Netherlands in efforts to hold the Syrian government accountable for torture under the United Nations Conven-tion against Torture. The Dutch correspondence is an important step that could eventually lead to proceedings against Syri a at the International Court of Justice 
(ICJ).  
In September, France’s highest court, the Cour de cassation, ruled that an indict-
ment against the company Laf arge for complicity in c rimes against humanity was 
wrongly canceled by the Paris Appeals Court.  
Key International Actors 
The UN-led peace process, including the constitutional committee, made virtu-ally no progress this year,  following a fifth round of  talks held in January 2021. 
Russia, Turkey, and Iran, continue to provide military and financial support to warring factions and to shield them from accountability. 
In July 2021, the UN Security Council failed to reauthorize full cross-border opera-
tions into the region and authorize a resumption of aid flows from Iraq to north-east Syria, due to the threat of a Russian veto. Instead, the Security Council was able to extend the opening of one border crossing to Northwest Syria. 
In April 2021, states parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention voted to sus-
pend Syrian rights and privileges at the Or ganisation for the Prohibition of Chem-
ical Weapons (OPCW). Syria’s government forc es have repeatedly used chlorine 
and the nerve agent sarin against men, women, and children over the course of the war. ISIS militants have on several occasions used sulfur mustard, according to the UN and OPCW. 
Individuals responsible for atrocity crime s, entities within or affiliated to the Syr-
ian government, and ISIS continue to  be under robust s anctions by the United 
States, European Union, and the UK, in addition to a few sector-wide sanctions. 
640WORLD REPORT 2022In July 2021, the US sanctioned financial facilitators who supported Hay’et Tahrir 
al-Sham as well.  
Israel has increas ingly and fr equently conducted  aerial strike s on Iranian or 
Hezbollah-manned targets in Syria. The Unit ed States and other members of the 
anti-ISIS coalition continue to support ISIS counteroperations, through their sup-port of the Syrian Democratic Forces.  
641HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTajikistan 
Tajikistan’s human rights record continued to deteriorate amid an ongoing crack-
down on freedom of expression and the po litical opposition, as well as targeting 
of independent lawy ers, journalis ts, and family members of oppo sition act ivists 
abroad. The government blocked access to websites that post information criti-cal of the gov ernment and harassed human rights groups.  
Freedom of religion and belief is severely limit ed. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender (LGBT) people are subjected to wide-ranging discrimination and so-cietal antipathy. Domestic violenc e continued to be a serious problem. Signifi-
cant legislative gaps, lack of accoun tability for family violence, and authorities’ 
inadequate response deter women from seeking help and support. Following the 
Taliban takeover in Afghanistan, Tajikist an received thousands of refugees, with 
many more gathering at the border. In January, President Emomali Rahmon de-clared the country coronavirus-fr ee, allowing re-opening of schools and 
mosques, However, as the number of ca ses soared in Ju ne, authorities re-intro-
duced some social distancing measures. 
Civil Society 
Many civil society groups conducting commu nity and h umanitarian w ork experi-
enced a renewed sense of purpose helping people through the Covid-19 pan-
demic, in response to what they sa w as poor government response. Although the 
government initially oppo sed such activis m, it event ually accepted  and even 
supported this work.  
Working on political rights, torture, elector al issues, corruption, freedom of reli-
gion, or LGBT rights/issues, however, remained sensitive and often led to ha-rassment of activis ts. Human rights defenders compl ained of the work of 
state-supported “troll factories” that aim to discredit critical voices online.  
Prison Conditions and Torture  
Tajik prisons remain ill-equipped and ov ercrowded, with prisoners routinely fac-
ing ill-treatment. In February, the Ministry of Justice approved plans to imple-ment a strategy for penal system re form. In July, some 1,700 prisoners, including 
642WORLD REPORT 2022Rakhmatullo Radjab, member of the banned Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajik-
istan, were transferred from the Dushan be prison to a newly constructed prison 
in Vakhdat, with reportedly better conditions.  
In September, more than 650 prisoners were released under the country-wide 
amnesty granted mostly to women, people under the age of 18 or over 55, and people with disabilities. Some 10,000 additional  prisoners will be released in 
2021. However, the amnesty will not affect political prisoners.  
In June, three police officers were sentenced to lengthy jail terms for using tor-
ture to extract a false confession in a murder case in 2017. They beat and used electricity on Hasan Yodgorov, who served six months before being released after the real  murderer was c aught.  
In April, 80 -year-old Don iyor Nabiev, sentenc ed in December 20 20 to seven 
years on charges of  “organizing activities of an extremi st organiz ation” was re-
leased on amnesty due to his old age and poor health. Prior to his detention and imprisonment, Nabiev helped families of imprisoned members of the banned Is-
lamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan. 
Physical and sexual violence agains t women by police officers in detention cen-
ters is also widespread. In 2019, Tajikistan’s Civil Society Coalition Against Tor-ture docu mented that  while N.B., a 24 -year-old wo man, was in detention for two 
days accused of theft, Vakhsh district police officers physically and verbally 
abused her, injected her with a shot that paralyzed her limbs, and raped her. To date, none of the police officers have been charged, as N.B.’s official complaint 
remains under consideration.  
Harassment of Critics and Dissidents  
In 2021, Tajikist an continued to harass and imprison gov ernment critic s, opposi-
tion, and foreign-ba sed diss idents and their fami ly members within the country.  
In June, the Khujand city court sentenced former member of the banned Islamic 
Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, Mir zo Hojimuhammad, also known as Mirzoqul 
Hojimatov, to five years in prison for “membership in a banned extremist organi-zation.” Hojimuhammad had lived in Russia since 2019, having quit IRPT in 2015, and upon h is return to Tajikistan in F ebruary was b anned from leaving the 
country. He was arrested in May. 
643HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn March, migrant w orkers’ rights defender , Izzat Amon, who has been critical  of 
the Tajik government  on social media, was abducted in Moscow and  forcibly re-
turned to Tajikistan. Amon worked for Toji kon, the Moscow-based legal center for 
Tajik migrants. Amon’s whereabouts were un known for two days until the Tajik-
istan Ministry of Interior said  that he was in pretrial detention on alleged  fraud 
charges. In a September court hearing the state prosecutor requested nine 
years’ imprisonment. 
In August, Tajik authorities opened a criminal  investigation against Khuseyn Is-
hankulov, one of Amon’s now former colle agues at the Tojikon, on charges of 
“public calls for extremist activities,” allegedly for urging Amon’s supporters to call for his release on social media. 
Freedom of Expression 
Under the pretext of protecting national secu rity, Tajikistan’s state telecommuni-
cations agency regularly blocks websites that carry information potentially criti-
cal of the government, including Facebook, Radio Ozodi, the website of Radio 
Free Europe’s Tajik service, and oppo sition websites. Journalists and bloggers 
are prosecuted for their critical opinions posted on social media, based on 2017 
legal amendments allowing security services to monitor individuals’ online activ-ities, including by keeping records of  mobile messages and comments.  
In June, lawyer A bdulmajid Riz oev was sentenced to five yea rs and six months’ 
imprisonment for “pub lic calls for extr emist activities us ing mass media or Inter-
net” under Article 307 of the crimin al code. Rizoev  was det ained in November 
2020 and the first  hearing on h is case was in F ebruary 2021, when the state 
prosecution declared his posts and reposts on Facebook to be of “extremist” na-
ture. The publications questioned participation rates in the 2020 parliamentary elections and quot ed classics of Tajik literature about wi se and unwi se govern-
ments.  
In September, journali st and activist of the banned  Islamic Renaissance Party of 
Tajikistan, Hikmatullo Sayfullzoda, sent enced to 16 years in prison in 2015, was 
attacked in the prison hospital. Earlier this year, Reporters Without Borders had called on Tajik authorities to release Say fullzoda under the amnesty, due to fears 
for his safety in prison.  
644WORLD REPORT 2022As of October, Radio Ozodi reported that eight longstanding accreditation re-
quests for its jour nalists were sti ll aw aiting a de cision by the For eign Ministry, 
and several staff members received accreditation only for several months, con-trary to the terms of Tajik legislation on media accreditation. Tajik security offi-
cers continue to intimidate Ozodi journalists at their workplaces and in their homes with threats of severe consequences  should they continue working at the 
service.  
Freedom of Religion and Belief 
The Tajik government severely curtails  freedom of religion or belief, proscribing 
certain forms of dress, including the hijab for women and long beards for men. 
Salafism, a fu ndamentalist  strand of  Islam, has been officially b anned in Tajik-
istan since 2011 and authorities regularly arrest individuals for alleged member-
ship in Salafi groups. 
In June, a closed-door trial of 18 suspect ed members of the Salafi movement 
began, with scant information made public  about the defendants or the charges 
they faced. The suspects—all residents of the Bobojon Ghafurov district in north-ern Tajikistan—were arrested in a police raid in February. The defendants deny 
having links with the Salafi mov ement or any other religious extremist group, 
their relatives said. They accused police of torturing the detainees to obtain con-fessions. In July, 14 of the 18 defendants we re sentenced to five and five-and-a-
half years in prison. The remaining four were convicted of not reporting a crime and sentenced to one year in prison.  
In October, the Tajik parliament started consideration of amendments to the 
criminal code on tightening penalties f or illegal religious education, including 
online education, with imprisonment of up to three years. Previously this was punishable with an administrative fine of up to 72,000 somoni (approximately US$6,000) or a prison term of up to thr ee years for a repeat offence.  
Conflict at the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan Border 
A two-day border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in late April—the 
worst in Central Asia in decades—killed  over 40 people, most  of them civili ans, 
and injured hundreds. The conflict began over control of a crucial water-intake 
645HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHfacility that diverts to Kyrg yzstan a small part of a river that flows naturally into 
Tajikistan, in line with a water-sharing protocol.  
About 58,000 people in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan fled their homes or were evac-
uated. Dozens of houses and at least three schools were damaged or destroyed. 
The two countries quickly called a cea sefire and committed to rebuilding houses 
damaged during the conflict in their respect ive territories. As of September, 
three nationals of Kyrgyzstan, ethnic Tajiks, and two nationals of Tajikistan were 
on trial in Kyrgyzstan for looting private property during the conflict.  
There were no reports of an impartial  investigation by Tajikistan into whether its 
military violated the laws of war du ring the conflict. However, the Tajik prosecu-
tor general has initiated a c riminal inv estigation into the Kyrgyz  military attack 
on the Chorkukh community in Sughd region that borders Kyrgyzstan. Some small-scale c onflicts between vill agers in the border areas have been reported 
since the conflict. 
Domestic Violence 
Domestic violence in Tajikistan is pr evalent. The 2013 law on the prevention of 
violence in the family, while offering some pr otection to sur vivor s, does not crim-
inalize domestic violence or marital rape, and remains poorly implemented. Sur-vivors lack adequate support and protection and have little re course to justice. 
Social stigma, economic dependencies, impunity for perpetrators, lack of acces-
sibility in protection measures for w omen with disabilities, including shelters, 
and insufficient  number of shelters pose serious barriers for su rvivors’ access to 
help, especially in rural areas.  
Service providers lack specialized victim-f ocused training and regularly face lack 
of funding. Police fail to pursue inves tigations, to enforce pr otection orders, or to 
arrest people who commit domestic violence. In the first eight months of the year, one of the only three s helters for victims of domes tic violence conducted as 
many consultations as it had during all of 2020.  
Crisis in Afghanistan and Refugees  
Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Tajik govern-
ment announced it would seek to protect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, the second largest ethnic group, in Afghanistan.  
646WORLD REPORT 2022An estimated 10,000 Afghans have fled in recent years to Tajikistan, which 
shares more than 1,400 kilometers of border with Afghanistan. Refugee camps 
have been established in the Khatlon region of Tajikistan with a capacity to ac-commodate 5,000 refugees. The camps ar e supported with funding from the Eu-
ropean Union. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, up to 50,000 refugees could be registered in Tajikistan after the total withdrawal of allied troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2021.  
Key International Actors  
In February, during its Cooperation Council with Tajikistan, the EU pressed Tajik-
istan to improve its track record on human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, EU High Representative Josep Borrell, following his meeting with Presi-dent Rahmon in Brussels in October, did not raise any human rights issues. 
In May, after the escalation of border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, 
the European Union, Organization for Sec urity and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE), and the UN all offered their assistanc e in resolving the conflict and re-
sponding to the immediate consequences for the livelihoods of people on both 
sides of the border. 
Following the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August, Tajikistan’s international part-
ners have stepped up engagement on security cooperation and refugee manage-ment with the government. In September, the EU provided Tajikistan €160,000 (around $180 ,000) in humanitari an aid to assist most vulnerable Afghan 
refugees. In September, members of the Col lective Security Treaty Organization 
(CSTO) signed an agreement at a summit in Tajikistan to strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border. 
At the UN Universal Periodic Review of Tajikistan in November several states 
made recommendations for Tajikistan to al low political opposition groups to op-
erate, release political prisoners, end the use of torture, respect freedom of ex-
pression and take steps to end domes tic violence against women and girls, as 
well as adopt comprehen sive anti-discrimin ation legislation th at would protect 
LGBT people, among others.
647HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTanzania 
President Samia Suluhu Hassan became Tanzania’s first female president on 
March 19, following the death of President John Magufuli on March 17 , 2021. Magufuli died five months into his second term as president. 
President Hassan took measures to respond to some rights concerns, but the 
government c ontinued to restrict  media and civic space, arbitrarily ar rest journal-
ists and critics of the government, enforce  a discriminatory ban on pregnant stu-
dents in schools, and undermine the rights  of women and children. The 
authorities have not conducted meaningful investigations into serious abuses 
that m arred the 2020 elections. Tanzania’s Se xual Offenses Spec ial Pro visions  
Act of 1998 continues to punish consensual  adult same-sex conduct by up to life 
imprisonment. 
Freedom of Expression and Media 
Although President Hassan pledged to remove existing restrictions on the media  
on April 6, authorities continued the Magufu li administration’s crackdown on the 
media. 
The media and human rights groups reported that on April 12, police arrested 
journalists Dickson Billikwija and Christopher James , detaining them for three 
hours within the premises of Temeke munic ipal government on the orders of the 
Temeke district executive director. 
On April 21, 2021, three security officers with the Kikosi cha Valantia Zanzibar 
(KVZ), an armed paramilitary group controlled by Zanzibar’s government, as-
saulted Jesse Mikofu , a reporter with the privately owned Mwananchi  newspa-
per, after he photographed them forcib ly evicting market traders from the 
Darajani area of Stone Town. 
On August 11, 2021, the government suspended Uhuru , a newspaper owned by 
the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (C CM), for publishing a story suggesting 
that President Hassan may not contest the 2025 presidential elections, the first newspaper suspension under President Hassan.  
648WORLD REPORT 2022On September 5, 2021, the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports sus-
pended the privately owned Raia Mwema newspaper  for 30 days for “repeatedly 
publishing false information and deliber ate incitement.” The paper had pub-
lished an article linking a gunman who had shot and killed four people outside the French Embassy to the CCM party.  
Legislative Reform  
On April 21, Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Palamagamba Kabudi told 
Parliament th at the Law Ref orm Comm ission was doing the groundwork for re-
view of the Economic and Organized Crime (Control) Act , which provides for non-
bailable offense s, including money-l aundering, which the gov ernment has in the 
past used to detain government critics and journalists. 
The authorities have started the process of amending the online content and the 
radio and tele vision bro adcasting content regulations of the Electr onic and 
Postal Communications Act. The current regulations give the Tanzania Communi-cations Regulatory Authority (TCRA) wide discretionary powers to license blogs, websites, and other online content, and 
prohibit radio and t elevision broadcast-
ers from working with foreign broadcasters  unless staff from the communica-
tions authority or other government depart ment are physically present. 
Government Opponents and Other Critics  
On January 5, a court in Dar es Salaam ordered the release  of human rights ac-
tivist Tito M agoti and inform ation technology profess ional Theodory Gyan from 
prison after paying a fine of Sh17.3 million (US$7 ,500). Magoti and Gyan had spent two years in detention on economic crimes charges, including money laun-
dering and leading organized crime. On December 20, 2019, 
police arrested 
Magoti  after luring him to “a meeting” through tex t messages from Giyani, his 
acquaintance. 
On June 22, the High Court overturned the September 20 20 decis ion of the Tan-
ganyika Law Society  to suspend human rights lawyer and government critic 
Fatma Karume from practicing law on mainland Tanzania. Karume’s suspension was in res ponse to alleg ations of mi sconduct after she ch allenged P resident 
Magufuli’s appointment of the attorney general of Tanzania. 
649HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOn July 21, police in Mwanza, northern Tanz ania, surrounded the hotel occupied 
by members of the country’s main opposition party, Chadema, and arrested 11 
party members, including the party chairman, Freeman Mbowe , ahead of a con-
ference to discuss reforms to the country’s constitution. The day before the 
scheduled meeting, authorities in Mwanza announced a ban on “unnecessary gatherings,” ostensibly to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The authorities later charged Mbowe with economic sabotage, conspiracy, and financing terrorist ac-tivities and placed him in pretrial custody.  
In 2012, the government embarked on a review of the constitution, but the 
process stalled in 2015 after President Magufuli took office and made it clear the review was not a priority f or his administration, say ing his government wo uld in-
stead pursue development projects. On June 29, President Hassan continued this policy, 
informing the media  that before the country embarks on a constitu-
tional reform process, she should fi rst be allowed to fix the economy. 
On September 22, the director of  public prosecutions withdrew sedition charges  
against opposition politician Tundu L issu, newspaper editor Simon Mkina, news-
paper publisher Ismail Mehbood, and journalist Jabir Idrissa Yunus, over a 2016 
Mawio  newspaper headline “Machafuko yaja Zanzibar”  (“Chaos is coming to 
Zanzibar”). 
Refugee Rights  
In 2021, Human Rights Watch rece ived credible reports of threats, harass ment, 
and arrests of Burundian refugees by T anzanian security forces. Tanzanian au-
thorities also forcibly returned or “pushed  back” thousands of Mozambicans 
fleeing violence in the country’s northern Cabo Delgado province during 2020 and 2021.  
In July, the United  Nations refugee agency  (UNHCR) and the Af rican Comm ission 
on Human and Peoples’ Rights expressed 
concern  with Tanzania’s forced returns 
of over 9,700 Mozambican asylum seekers at the Negomano border point be-tween January and June, without an assess ment of their international protection 
needs. Many were fleeing armed conflict and insecurity in the coastal city of Palma, following a brutal attack by non-state armed groups in March 2021. The 
650WORLD REPORT 2022pushbacks violated the principle of non-refoulement under international stan-
dards and regional refugee law. 
Women’s Rights  
On August 23, at a ceremony hos ting the Tanzania men’s football team, the pres-
ident made remarks  that cast aspersions on the “femininity” and gender of Tan-
zanian women footbal lers, which was w idely condemned by act ivists.  
Children’s Rights  
The Tanzanian government continues to discriminate against girls by subjecting 
them to mandatory pregnancy tests and explicitly barring students who are preg-
nant or are mothers from attending public schools.  
In June 2017 , Magufuli officially declare d a ban on pregnant students and adoles-
cent mothers attending school.  Pursuant to its agreement with the World Bank , 
tied to a $500 million loan for the government’s Secondary Education Quality 
Improvement Program, the Tanzanian government announced that it would allow students who were pregnant or were mothers to enroll in a parallel accel-erated education program, described as “alternative education pathways.” 
However, 
these centers are often not accessible  because of the long distances 
students must travel to reach them and because they charge fees, unlike pub-lic primary and secondary schools that are tuition-free. 
At time of writing, the government had not outlawed child marriage, meaning 
the authorities had not complied with 
a 2016 High Cour t decision  to amend the 
Marriage Act to raise the legal age of m arriage to 18 years for girls and boys.

HUMAN   
RIGHTS   WATCH  Thailand 
The government of Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha, in 2021, restricted fun-
damental rights, particularly free expression and assembly, arbitrarily arrested democracy act ivists and critics of the monarchy, and enforced a nationwide state 
of emergency using the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext. The authorities sup-pressed youth-led democracy protes ts, sometimes violently. The government in-
troduced a draft  law to tightly cont rol all civil society org anizations, restrict 
foreign funding for nongovernmental or ganizations (NGOs), and imposed com-
pulsory registration.  
Youth-Led Democracy Protests  
There were thousands of democracy protest s across Thailand in 2020 and 2021. 
Rather than engaging with them on the issues, the authorities seemed intent on preventing protests from gaining support and spreading across the country.  
The 
youth-led uprising  became widely known for its iconic three-finger salute 
displayed by tens of thousands in the streets demanding a new democratic con-stitution be introduced with reforms to the monarchy. The momentum of the protests was seriously disrupted by the p andemic and subsequent lockdown 
measures, as well as criminal prosec ution, violent crackdo wns, and ha rass ment 
of protesters.  
Since August, the street protests have  become inc reasingly  leaderle ss and repre-
sented by the largely underprivileged, heav ily impacted, urb an poor. These pro-
testers, some as young as 12, are demanding Prime Minister Prayut step down as a first step toward ending authoritarian ru le, cronyism, corruption, and govern-
ment inefficiency.  
The front line of increasingly  violent con frontations was in B angkok’s Din Daeng 
district. Protesters vandalized and bu rned traffic police booths, police vehicles, 
and royal portraits. Riot police used water cannons mixed with dye and teargas chemicals, as well as teargas grenades and rub ber bullets to disperse the 
crowds. While the authorities 
claimed  to follow international standards for crowd 
control, in practice riot  police routinely used excessive  force against protesters, 
in some cases causing serious injuries . Protesters, widely referred to by the 
653HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHmedia as Taluh Gas  (shattering teargas), used slingshots, fireworks, and Molo-
tov cocktails to attack the police.  
Covid-19 State of Emergency, Restrictions on Freedom of 
Expression   
In September, the government ordered the ex tension of its nationwide enforce-
ment of the draconian Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency 
Situation  to November, continuing the authorities’ broad powers to restrict fun-
damental fr eedoms with impu nity. It was the fo urteenth extension since March 
2020. At least 1,100 people  who took part in democracy protests have been 
charged with violating social distancing measures, curfew restrictions, and other emergency measures. Some of them have also been charged with sedition.  
The government used the emergency measures to clamp down on freedom of ex-
pression and media freedom. In Ju ly, Prime Minister Prayut issued 
emergency 
regulation number 29 , empowering the authorities to censor online expression 
and prosecute individuals responsible f or communications that may “instigate 
fear” or distort information about the pandemic. The government revoked this regulation in August, after the Bangkok Civil Court 
ruled  that it violated the con-
stitutionally recognized right to freedom of expression.  
In November 2020, Prime Minister Prayut ordered Thai authorities  to use “all 
laws and all articles” against democracy protesters, bringing back lèse-majesté  
(insulting the monarchy) pro secutions after a three -year hiatus . The authorities 
have since charged at least 151 people , including 12 children, under Article 112 
of the penal code in relation to various activities at democracy protests or com-ments on social media. Mak ing critical or off ensive  comments about  the monar-
chy is also a serious criminal offense under the Computer-Related Crime Act.  
Prominent democracy  activis ts, including Arnon Namph a, Parit Chiw arak, Jatupat 
Boonpattararaksa, and Panupong Jadnok, ha ve been put in pretrial detention in 
lèse-majesté cases that could take years to be concluded in the courts.  
In January 2021, former opposition leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit was 
charged  with lèse-majesté and cybercrimes for criticizing Siam Bioscience, a 
company owned by the king that produces Covid-19 vaccines.  
654WORLD REPORT 2022In January, the Bangkok Criminal Court sentenced Anchan Preelert to 87 years in 
prison (later halved after she pleaded guilty), setting a new record  for length of 
imprisonment meted out in a lèse-majesté conviction.  
Torture and Enforced Disappearance  
On September 16, the parliament approved the first reading of the Prevention 
and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Bill .  
Torture and enforced disappearance have long been problems in Thailand. Most 
of the reported cases have not been res olved, and hardly  anyone has been pun-
ished.  
Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases related to counterinsur-
gency operations in Thailand’s southern border provinces  in which police and 
military personnel tortured ethnic Malay Muslims in custody. There are also cred-
ible reports of torture being used as a form of punishment of military conscripts . 
During the five years of military rule aft er the 2014 coup, many people taken into 
incommunicado military custody alleged they were tortured or otherwise ill-
treated while being detained and  interrogated by soldiers . In addition, police 
and military units have often carried out anti-drug operations without effective safeguards against torture and other abuses. In August, police officers 
tortured 
to death  a suspected drug trafficker in Nakhon Sawan province.  
Since 1980, the United Nations Working Grou p on Enforced or Involuntary Disap-
pearances has recorded 91 cases  of enforced disappearance in Thailand, includ-
ing of the prominent Muslim lawyer Somchai Neelapaijit  in March 2004. In 
recent years, at least nine d issidents who fled persecution in Thail and have been 
forcibly disappeared in neighboring countries . In September, the working group 
raised concerns in its annual report  about enforced disappearances in the con-
text of transnational transfers between Thailand and neighboring countries.  
Thailand is a state party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhu-
man or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  and also signed, but did not ratify, 
the International Convention for the Protection of  All Persons from Enforced Dis-
appearance .  
655HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHLack of Accountability for State-Sponsored Abuses  
Despite evidence showing that soldiers were responsible for most of the casual-
ties during the 2010 political confrontations  with the United Front for Democracy 
Against Dictatorship (the “Red Shirts”) that left at least 99 dead and more than 2,000 injured, no military personnel or officials from the government of then-Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva have been charged.  
The government also has fai led to pursue c riminal in vestigations  of ex trajudic ial 
killings related to anti-drug operations, especially the more than 2,800 killings that accompanied then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s “
war on drugs ” in 
2003.  
Human Rights Defenders, NGO Law  
The government has failed to fulfill its oblig ation to ensure h uman rights defend-
ers can carry out their work in a safe and enabling environment.  
On May 4, a gunman fatally shot Somsak Onchuenjit , a lawyer and land rights ac-
tivist, in Trang province.  
The police has m ade no prog ress in in vestigating violent attacks  in 2019 target-
ing prominent democr acy act ivists Siraw ith Seritiwat, An urak Jeantaw anich, and 
Ekachai Hongkangwan.  
Cover-up actions and shoddy police work continue to hamper the efforts to pros-
ecute soldiers who shot de ad ethnic Lahu act ivist Chaiyaphum Pasae  in March 
2017 in Chiang Mai province and park offic ials involved in the murder of ethnic 
Karen activist Porlajee “Billy” Rakchongcharoen  in April 2014 in Phetchaburi 
province.  
Despite the adoption of Thailand’s National Action Plan on Business and Human 
Rights  in 2019, Thai authorities have failed  to protect human rights defenders 
from reprisals  and end the a busive u se of strategic lawsuits against public par-
ticipation  (SLAPP). Former Nation al Human Rights  Commiss ioner and Magsaysay 
Award winner Angkhana Neelapaijit  is one of the many act ivists hit w ith such re-
taliatory lawsuits.  
656WORLD REPORT 2022The government took no steps to ref orm the National Human Rights Commiss ion 
of Thail and, whic h was downgraded  by the Global Alliance of National Human 
Rights Institutions  in 2016 because of its subst andard selection process for com-
missioners and its lack of political independence.  
In February 2021, the government approved in principle the Operations of Not-
for-Profit Organizations Bill . The authorities would have broad discretion under 
the proposed law to arbitrarily deny registration of nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs) and make them subject to criminal charges that include up to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of THB100,000 (US$3,225).  
In addition, NGOs will be required to seek prior approval from the minister of in-
terior for activities supported with fo reign funding. The bill also permits the au-
thorities to enter NGO offices for ins pection and to obtain electronic 
communications. After massive international  criticis m and a grow ing nation al 
campaign against the draft law, the gov ernment sent it  for revisions by the Coun-
cil of State, the government’s legal arm.  
Violence and Abuses in the Southern Border Provinces  
The armed conflict in Thailand’s Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and Songkhla provinces, whic h has resulted in more than 7 ,000 deaths since January 2004, 
subsided in the first half of 2021, partly due to the unilateral ceasefire announce-ment by Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) to facilitate h umanitarian assistance 
for people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The ceasefire ended when BRN is-
sued a statement on July 20, 
criticizing  the government for taking advantage of 
the situation to raid their strongholds. Insur gent attacks on military targets and 
civilians have since increased .  
The government has not pro secuted members of  its secu rity forces  responsible 
for tortur e, unlawful ki llings, and other abus es of ethnic  Malay Mus lims. In many 
cases, the authorities provided financial compensation to the victims or their families in exchange for their agreement not to speak out against the security 
forces or file crimin al cases against officials. Thai land has not  endorsed the 
Safe 
Schools Declaration .  
657HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHRefugees, Asylum Seekers, and Migrant Workers  
Thailand is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 protocol. The 
authorities continue to treat asylum seekers as illegal migrants subject to arrest, detention, and deportation.  
In September, the Bangkok Criminal Court released Malaysian transgender ac-
tivist Nur Sajat, who was rec ognized as a refugee by the UN High C ommiss ioner 
for Refugees, on bail aft er she was arrested on il legal ent ry charges. The 
Malaysian authorities unsuccessfully attempted to extradite her from Thailand to 
face charges of insulting Islam for having dressed as a woman.  
The authorities have made no progress in investigating the app arent enforced 
disappear ance of exiled  diss idents from 
Vietnam  and Laos  in Bangkok.  
The government refused to let the UN refugee agency conduct status determina-
tions for Lao Hmong, ethnic Rohingya, and Uighurs, and people from Myanmar and North Korea held in immigration detention. More than 50 Uighurs and sev-eral hundred Rohingya remain in indefinite detention in squalid conditions in immigration lockups.  
Despite government-instituted reforms in the fishing industry, 
many migrant 
workers face forced labor, remain in debt bondage to recruiters, cannot change employers, and receive sub-minimum w ages that are paid months late
.  
The government has failed to adequately provide migrant worker s with interna-
tionally recognized worker rights, such as protection for freedom of association 
and collective bargaining. Migrant workers are barred in law from organizing and 
establishing labor unions, or serving as a government recognized labor union leader.  
The government ordered f actories, construction sites, markets, and worker dor-
mitories to be temporarily sealed off during the pandemic, locking tens of thou-
sands of migrant workers inside with limit ed access to essential supplies and 
health care.  
Thammakaset Company Limited  continues to retaliate  against migrant workers, 
rights act ivists, and journalists who report on a busive l abor conditions at its 
chicken farm in Lopburi province.  
658WORLD REPORT 2022In July, Thail and was do wngraded in the US Trafficking in Per sons (TIP) Report 
from Tier 2 to the Tier 2 Watchlist  for the first time in four years.  
Gender Inequality  
In February 2021, Thailand passed a law permitting abortion during the first 12 
weeks of pregnancy. This reform is an important advance, but falls short  of fully 
protecting pregnant people’s reproductive rights. The criminal code continues to 
impose up to six months in jail and fines on those who seek abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy if they cannot meet 
criteria  set by the Medical Council of 
Thailand.  
While Thailand enacted the Gender Equality Act  in 2015, implementation re-
mains prob lematic. There has been little progre ss in the parliamentary review of 
the Life Partnership Bill . If enacted, this law will be an important step towards 
recognizing the fundamental dignity of same-sex couples and providing them with important legal protections. The current draft, however, still needs improve-
ments to comply with international standards on equality and non-discrimina-tion. On September 28, the Constitutional Court 
postponed  its ruling on whether 
the Civil and Commercial Code, which currently only recognizes marriage be-tween a man and a woman, contravenes the constitution.  
Despite being a popular destination f or gender-affirming health care, Thailand 
continues to lack a procedure by which transgender people can change their legal gender.  
Key International Actors  
The US and like-minded countries raised concerns in 2021 about the govern-ment’s proposed rights-violating NGO law and other major human rights issues, but did not publicly speak out. The Unit ed States, European Union, United King-
dom, Australia, and Canada have been instrumental in providing protection for 
refugees and asylum-seekers arrested by the authorities and at risk of refoule-ment.  
659HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThe EU continued to take steps towards the resumption of negotiations for a bi-
lateral free trade agreement with Thailand, which have been frozen since the 2014 coup.  
In November, the UN Human Rights Council held the third cycle Universal Peri-
odic Review (UPR) of Thailand. Key issues raised by member states and rights groups included torture, enforced di sappearance, freedom of expression, associ-
ation and peaceful assembly, refugees, the rights of older people, the death penalty, impunity for stat e-sponsored rights abuses, emergency powers, and na-
tional rights mechanisms.  
660WORLD REPORT 2022Tunisia 
In 2021, security forces continued to use violence to curb socio-economic 
protests in several parts of the country. In January, police in several cities beat demonstrators, detaining hundreds, many of them minors. Clashes with police 
in the city of Sbeitla led to the death of a young man. At least two more men died in 
Sfax  and Sidi H assine  during clashes with the police. 
On July 25, Pres ident Ka is Saied  announced th at he was assu ming exceptional 
powers, following months of political deadlock  and a severe ec onomic crisis  ex-
acerbated by Covid-19 pandemic.   
Saied’s measures encompassed sus pending parliament, removing the immunity 
of parliament arians, dism issing the prime minister, remo ving other high-lev el of-
ficials from their positions and assuming oversight of the office of the public prosecutor. On August 24, Saied expanded on the exceptional measures and an-nounced their 
indefinite  extension. On September 29, Saied appointed a prime 
minister and on October 11 swor e in a cabinet of ministers that he had approved. 
On July 24, President Saied extended u ntil early 2022 the state of emergency 
that has been in effect almost continuously since it was first pu t in place in 2015 
following a series of terrorist attacks. 
Implementation of the Constitution  
Successive  parliaments have failed , since the adoption of the constitution in 
2014, to put in place the Constitutional Court, a key independent judicial body tasked with ensuring respect of the cons titution. Parliament could not reach the 
two-thirds majority needed to select its allotted share of judges. President Saied 
refused  in April to sign a law that would have lowered the two-thirds threshold.  
Freedom of Expression, Association and Assembly, and 
Conscience  
Members of Tunisian sec urity forces  allegedly  used excessive violence  to sup-
press protesters denouncing economic hardship and demanding social justice and an end to police repression during n ationwide protests that erupted on Jan-
661HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHuary 15. Police officers allegedly  beat up protesters, arrested  hundreds of them, 
including many minors , fired exce ssive teargas to break up pro tests, and at-
tacked journalists. Haykel Rachdi, 21, from Sbeitla, died  on January 18 after sus-
taining a head injury following police intervention during a protest. 
On January 17 , police in the Mou rouj district  near Tunis arreste d 25-year- old stu-
dent Ahmed Ghram at his home for Facebook posts criticizing police repression, 
impunity, and corrupt governance. Authorities accused Ghram of “inciting ac-tions of chaos and disorder.” Ghram spent  11 days in pretrial  detention before he 
was ac quitted and released. 
Transitional Justice  
More than one year after the publication  on June 24, 2020, of the final report of 
the Truth and Dignity C ommiss ion, a state body established  in 2013 to expose 
and investigate systematic human rights abuses that occurred in Tunisia over a five-decade period, the c ommission’s re commendations to imp lement major in-
stitutional  reforms remain un fulfilled. The c ommiss ion’s recommend ations in-
clude establishing rehabilitation center s and support services for victims, 
ensuring effective judicial monitoring of pl aces of detention, and allowing moni-
toring bodies regular and timely access to places of detention and direct interac-
tions with the pri soners. The government  has yet to fulfill its ob ligations under 
article 70 of 2013 
transitional justice law , which requires it to put in place a plan 
to implement the recommendations  of the c ommiss ion.   
Counterterrorism and Detention 
At least 10 women with ties to suspected  members of Islamic State (ISIS), re-
leased from Libyan prisons and handed over to authorities in Tunisia in March, remain in detention. Some have reported a buse in prison. Fourteen children 
were also repatriated, 12 of whom have been released to the care of relatives. 
At least 16 more w omen and 19 children suspected of links to ISIS members re-
main detained in Tripoli’s Mitiga prison, according to the Tunisian Observatory for Human Rights. 
662WORLD REPORT 2022Women’s Rights  
Tunisian law discriminates against women in inheritance rights. At time of writ-
ing parliament had still not approved a bill supported by the late President Beji Caid Essebsi  in 2018, while he was in office, to set equality  in inherit ance rights 
as the default. The bill would allow persons  to opt out of the equality framework 
and choose instead to have their wealth distributed according to the previous legal framework. 
During a parliamentary plenary session on June 30, 2021, two male MPs physi-
cally assaulted Abir Moussi, an opposition MP . She had been the target of a se-
ries of verbal and physical att acks in and outside parliament, including 
gender-specific epithets. The National Associative Coalition for the Elimination of Violence, the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, and the Tunisian Human Rights League condemned the attacks as gender based.  
In July, the Ministry of Women, Family, Children, and Seniors launched the web-
site Toutes et tous Uni.e.s (Together against Violence), a platform providing in-formation and support available in relation to gender equality, violence against women, protection of women, as well as vio lence against children. The website 
provides tools to help prevent violenc e against women and raise awareness of 
these issues. 
Despite the 2017 violence against w omen law, which set out new protection 
mechanisms for sur vivor s, reports show gaps in implementation of the law par-
ticularly in the way police deal with comp laints by women of domestic violence. 
On May 9, 2021,  Refka Cherni, a 26 -year-old mother, was al legedly s hot dead  by 
her husband, an officer in the National Guard, two days after she went to her 
local police station to file a complaint ag ainst him for allegedly trying to strangle 
her. According to a spokesperson of Kef First Instance court the police neither ar-rested nor issued a restraining order agains t him, after Cherni had decided to 
drop her complaint.   
Refugees and Migrants 
Maritime operations to intercept or rescue migrants off the coast of Tunisia in-
creased  by 90 percent in the first six months of 2021, according to the Interna-
tional Organization for Migration. On September 26, Tunisian authorities 
663HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHintercepted at sea and expelled  to the desert at the border with Libya around 100 
sub-Saharan African migrants, including childr en, in violation of prohibitions of 
non-refoulement and collective  expulsions u nder international and regional law. 
Due to the continued absence  of a national legal framework on asylum, refugees 
and asylum seekers in Tunisia did not have formal legal status, limiting their ability to access certain services. However, refugees, asylum seekers and mi-grants were 
included  in the national Covid-19 vaccination campaign that began 
in March 2021. 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Tunisian police officers repeatedly targeted  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
and intersex (LGBTI) activis ts at gener al protests that to ok place in January in 
Tunis against deteriorating economic conditions and the government’s handling of the pandemic and singled them out for mistreatment. Officers 
arbitrarily ar-
rested  LGBTI act ivists, assau lted them, and threa tened sever al of them with vio-
lence including rape and murder . Some used social media  to ha rass and  “out” 
the identity of the act ivists by reve aling pr ivate information such  as their home 
addresses and phone numbers, and incited indiv iduals to ridicu le and harass 
them. 
Authorities continued to prosecute and imprison presumed gay men under Arti-
cle 230 of the penal code , which provides up to three years in prison for 
“sodomy.” Damj Association for J ustice and Equality, a Tunis-based LGBT group, 
said there were 1,458 convictions based on Article 230, ranging between four months to three years in prison, between 2011 and 2020. 
On March 4, a Tunis court 
sentenced Rania Amdouni , a queer and feminist ac-
tivist, to six months in prison and  a fine for “insulting a public officer during the 
performance of his duty , “causing em barrass ment and di sruption,” and  “appar-
ent drunkenness.” Police arrested Amdouni on February 27 for shouting outside 
a police station, after officers had refused to  register her complaint relating to re-
peated harass ment to which she s aid police officers ha d subjected her on the 
street and online. On March 17 , the Court of Appeal in Tunis upheld her convic-tion and suspended her prison sentence. After her release, Amdouni obtained asylum in France.
664WORLD REPORT 2022Turkey 
The authoritarian and highly centralized presidential government of Recep Tayyip 
Erdoğan has set back Turkey’s human rights record  by decades, targeting per-
ceived government critics and political opponents, profoundly undermining the independence of the judiciary, and hollowing out democratic institutions. Turkey withdrew from the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Vi olence, known as the Istanbul Conven-
tion, a major reversal for women’s rights. 
Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly 
While most news outlets are owned by c ompanies with close government links, 
independent media in Turkey mainly operate via online platforms but are subject to regular removal of content or pro secution for news coverage critical of senior 
government figures and members of President Erdoğan’s family or deemed to constitute an offense under Turkey’s highly restrictive Anti-Terror Law. At time of 
writing, 58 journalists and media workers were in prison or serving sentences for terrorism offenses because of  their journalistic work or association with media. 
In November, on the grounds that it  restricted reporting and media freedom, 
Turkey’s top administrative court halted the implementation of an Interior Min-
istry April circular banning citizens or journalists from recording videos or taking photos of police officers on duty.  
After strong criticism on social media of the authorities’ response to wildfires in 
Turkey’s forested Mediterrane an region, the government signaled plans to fur-
ther tighten restrictions on social media by making “disinformation” via social media an offence punishable with a pri son sentence of between two to five 
years. No legal amendment had been made at time of writing. Thousands of peo-ple every year already face arrest and  prosecution for their social media posts, 
typically charged with defamation, insulting the president, or spreading terrorist propaganda.  
Major social media platforms such as Y ouTube, Facebook, and Twitter complied 
with a 2020 legal amendment requiring them to set up offices in Turkey, raising 
665HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHconcerns that they may in future be forced to increase their compliance with gov-
ernment censorship in order to avoid heavy fines and other penalties. 
Provincial authorities selectively used Covid-19 as a pretext to ban peaceful 
protests by students, workers, political opposition parties, and women’s and 
lesbian, gay, bisexual  and transgender (LGB T) people’s rights  activis ts. President 
Erdoğan’s appointment of an unelected rect or to the prestigious Boğaziçi Univer-
sity sparked protests, which were met with violent police crackdown and prose-
cutions  against dozens of student protesters. 
Rollbacks on Women’s and LGBT Rights 
Turkey is the first country to have withdrawn from the Istanbul Convention. The move in March drew widespread criticism internationally, and saw protests by women’s rights groups. It spells a major reversal for efforts to combat gender-
based violence and promote women’s rights  in Turkey. Government officials jus-
tified the withdrawal and attempted to appeal to conservative voters with the specious claim that the Convention “normalizes homosexuality.”
 Hundreds of 
women are murdered annually in Turkey and reported incidents of domestic vio-
lence remain high.  
The government banned the annual LGBT Pride march in Istanbul for the seventh 
successive ye ar and police violently  dispersed and detained  protesters. Senior 
government officials have on several occasions attacked and encouraged dis-crimination against LGBT people in their political speeches. 
Human Rights Defenders 
The fo ur-year detention and ongoing trial of  Osman Kavala, a leading figure in 
civil society , exemplified the enormous p ressure on human rights grou ps and 
other nongovernmental groups (NGOs) critical of the government. Kavala is on trial on baseless charges in connection with the 2013 Gezi Park protests and the July 2016 failed  coup. Turkey has flouted a Eur opean Court of  Human Rights’ 
judgment ordering his immediate release on grounds of insufficient evidence. 
The judgment found that Kavala’s detention sought to silence him as a human rights defender.  
666WORLD REPORT 2022Authorities continued to use t errorism and def amation char ges to harass rights 
defenders, and to viol ate their right to as sembly. The Court of Cass ation has yet 
to review the 2020 convictions for membe rship of a terrorist organization and 
aiding and abetting terrorism of Taner Kılıç , the former chair of Amnesty Interna-
tional Turkey, and three others for their participation in a human rights educa-tion workshop.  
On 15 February, an Istanbul court convicted Eren Keskin, co-chair of the Human 
Rights Association, on charges of “members hip of a terrorist organization” on 
the b asis of her role as co-editor-in-chief  of the pr o-Kurdish Özgür Gündem  
newspaper. She has appe aled. On March 19, Keskin’s co-ch air, Ö ztürk Türk-
doğan, was briefly detained  and remains  under inves tigation for “mem bership of 
a terrorist or ganization” with a travel ban. Two activis ts running the D iyarbakır- 
based Rosa Women’s Association have appealed convictions on the same charge and others in the associ ation face continuing prosecution. 
In January, the Law on Preventing Financing of Proliferation of Weapons of Mass 
Destruction came into force. A lthough Turkey has jus tified the la w as an effort to 
bring the country into compliance with binding United Nations Security Council 
resolutions to prevent financing of terr orism and weapons proliferation, the law 
instead furnishes the Interior Ministry with greater powers to target NGOs’ legiti-mate and lawful activities and the right to association of their members.  
Torture and Ill-Treatment in Custody, Enforced Disappearances  
There was little evidence to sugg est prosecutor s made progress in inves tigating 
the rising allegations of torture and ill-treatment in police custody and prison re-ported over the past five years. Few such allegations result in prosecution of the security force s, and a per vasive cultur e of impunity  persis ts. 
In two May 2021 rulings, the Constitutional Court found violations of the prohibi-
tion on ill-treatment and ordered new inv estigations into complaints that prose-
cutors had dismissed at the time they were lodged in 2016. One concerned the complaint of torture and rape in police custody lodged by a male teacher A. A. in the town of Afyon, the second a complaint by a male teacher E. B. in Antalya al-leging police tortured him in custody requiring him to undergo emergency sur-
gery.  
667HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHNo progress was r eported in the prosecutor’s inv estigation of the ca se of Osman 
Şiban and Servet Turgut, two Kurdis h men detained by military personnel in their 
southeast village in September 2020, taken away in a helicopter, and later found by their families seriously injured in hospital. Turgut 
died  of his injuries.  
In the case of the June 5 death in police custody in Istanbul of private security of-
ficer Birol Yıldırım, weeks after media air ed camera footage of police beating 
him, a deputy su perintendent was det ained and is on tria l with 11 other police 
officers. 
An investigation into the full circumstanc es behind the death on February 19 of 
Kadir Aktar,17 , at Maltepe Children’s  Prison, continues. Reported by the media as 
a suicide, medical re cords present substantial evidence th at Aktar was ill-treated 
in police custody. 
Abductions and enforced disappearances c ontinue to be reported and are not in-
vestigated properly. Those disappeared for the longest periods have been indi-
viduals the authoritie s allege have links w ith the movement  run by US-based 
cleric Fethullah Gülen, which Turkey deems  a terrorist organization responsible 
for the July 2016 military coup attempt . Hüseyin Galip Küçüköz yiğit, a former civil 
servant, disappeared in Ankara on December 29, 2020. On July 14, authorities informed his f amily that  he was held in pretri al detention. There had been no in-
formation about his whereabouts for ov er seven months. Yusuf Bilge Tunç, an-
other former civil servant , remained miss ing after he disappe ared in August 
2019. 
Turkish authorities continued to seek the extradition of alleged Gülen movement 
supporters, many of them teachers, fr om countries around the world. Some 
countries that complied with Turkey’s requests bypassed legal procedures and judicial review and colluded in abductions, enforced disappearances, and the il-legal transfer of individuals. Two such cases in 2021 were the abduction on May 31 and rendition to Turkey from Kyrgyzstan of Orhan İnandı, a director of schools in Kyrgyzstan; and Turkey’s announcement on May 31 that it had “captured” and transferred to Turkey Selahaddin Gülen, a Turkish national and registered asylum seeker in Kenya. 
Some individuals active in leftist or Kurdish politics reported that plain-clothed 
security personnel abducted and detained them in undisclosed sites for shorter 
668WORLD REPORT 2022periods. One such ca se was that of Gökhan Güne ş, whose complaint  to the pros-
ecutor of being abducted in Istanbul on Januar y 20, interrogated, tortured, and 
released on January 26 resulted in a Sept ember decis ion that there was no ca se 
to pursue. His lawyers have appealed. 
Kurdish Conflict and Crackdown on Opposition  
Occasional armed clashes between the military and the armed Kurdistan Work-ers’ Party (PKK) continued in r ural areas of Tu rkey’s eastern and  southeastern re-
gions although Turkey has concentrated its military c ampaign including drone 
strikes in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, where the PKK bases are located. In Feb-
ruary, the Turkish military reported th at an operation to rescue 13 soldiers and 
police officers held hostage by the PKK in northern Iraq had resulted in the PKK 
killing the 13.  
In 2021, the Erdogan ruling coalition intensified its ongoing campaign to crimi-
nalize the legitimate political activities of the opposition Peoples’ Democratic 
Party (HDP), which won 11.7 percent of the national vote in 2018 parliamentary 
elections. The government refuses to distinguish between the HDP and the PKK. There were physical attacks on HDP offices, most notably in June in the western province of Izmir where a gunman shot dead party member Deniz Poyraz. 
Scores of former HDP politicians including mayors are held as remand prisoners 
or are serving sentences  after being convicted  of terrorism offenses on the basis 
of their legitimate non-violent political activities, speeches, and social media 
postings. In one such case beginning in May, do zens of current and former HDP 
politicians, including the jai led former co-c hairs Sel ahattin Demir taş and Figen 
Yüksekdağ, stood trial in a new pr oceeding for their alleged role in violent 
protests on October 6-8, 2014, that led to 37 deaths. The earlier ongoing case files against Demir taş and Yüksek dağ have been combined  with this case. The 
trial was ongoing at time of writing. 
In June, the Constitutional Court accepted an indictment filed by the Court of 
Cassation chief prosecutor to perm anently shut down the HDP and impose a 
five-year ban from political activity on 45 1 politicians and party officials. The 
case was ongoing at time of writing. 
669HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHHDP MP Ömer Faruk Gergerlioğlu was released fr om prison and reinstated to his 
parliamentary seat in July after the Constitutional Court found that a conviction 
for a social media post resulting in h is expulsion from parliament in March and 
imprisonment in April violated his rights. 
Justifying its January 2018 and October 201 9 military incurs ions into areas of 
northeast Syria as part of an effort to co mbat PKK affiliates, Turkey continues to 
occupy t erritory and has illegally transferred Sy rian nationals to Tu rkey to face 
trial on terrorism charges that  could lead to life imprisonment. 
Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Migrants  
Turkey continues to host the world’s largest  number of refugees, around 3.7 mil-
lion from Syria granted temporary pr otection status, and over 400,000 from 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and other non-European countries, who under Turkish law cannot be fully recognized as refugees.  
Continuing its policy of securing its border s against the entry of more asylum 
seekers and migrants, Turkey continued building a wall in 2021 along its eastern border with Iran, and summarily pushing back Afghans and others apprehended 
attempting to cross the border.  
There have been signs of a rise in racist and xenophobic attacks against foreign-
ers. On August 10, groups of youths att acked workplaces and homes of Syrians 
in a neighborhood in Ankara a day after a fight during which a Syrian youth al-legedly stabbed two Turkish youths, killing one. Two Syrian youths are on trial for murder. The prosecutor’s in vestigation into dozens of youths for damaging prop-
erty, theft, and other crimes continues. Opposition politicians have made 
speeches that fuel anti-ref ugee sentiment and suggest that Syrians should be re-
turned to war-torn Syria. 
There were reports, including by the Turkish coast guard, that migrants attempt-
ing to cross into Greece from Turkey thr ough sea and land borders were summar-
ily and violently pushed back by Greek security forces.  
670WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors 
Turkey has a troub led political rel ationship with the EU, mitigated by a transac-
tional relationship on issues such as migration. Turkey’s accession process to the EU is at a standstill. The EU provides financial support to Turkey in return for restrictions on entry of refugees and migrants to the bloc. The European Council in June 
reiterated its concerns  regarding rule of law and fundamental rights in 
Turkey, without making human rights a priority in the relationship.  
Turkey’s failure to implement binding European Court of Human Rights judg-
ments calling for the release of rights def ender Osman Kavala and Kurdish politi-
cian Selahattin Demir taş has set back its relationship with the Coun cil of Europe. 
In its September session, the Council of Eu rope’s Committee of Ministers reiter-
ated its call for the immediat e release of both men and decided that a failure to 
release Osman Kavala by the December session would spell notification of in-fringement proceedings against Turkey, a sanction method involving further ap-
plication to the European Court only used  against a Council of Europe member 
state once before.  
The Council of Europe’s  commiss ioner for human rights, the UN Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, UN human rights special rap-porteurs and the UN Human Rights Office have criticized Turkey for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention. 
The deep cr isis in Tu rkish-US relations continued under the Biden adminis tra-
tion. Multiple rea sons include Turk ey’s purchase of Russian S- 400 m issile s, the 
presence on US soil of Fethullah Gülen, and US support for Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria. For the first time, the US State Department added Turkey to its 2021 Trafficking in Persons list of coun tries implicated in using child soldiers in 
connection with its backing for a Syrian armed opposition group. The Biden ad-ministration also formally recogniz ed the Armenian genocide committed by the 
Ottoman government 100 years ago.  
In October, Turkey ratified the Paris Agreement, the international treaty on cli-
mate change adopted in Paris in December 2015, while also committing to a goal to reach net zero emissions by 2053. As one of the world’s top 20 greenhouse 
gas emitters, Turkey is contrib uting to the climat e crisis that is taking a mounting 
toll on human rights around the globe.
671HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHTurkmenistan 
Turkmenistan continued  to be one of the world’s most oppre ssive and closed 
countries, ruled by authoritarian President  Gurbanguly Berdy mukhamedov, his 
relatives, and associates. Authorities failed  to address the impact of the coun-
try’s multi-year ec onomic cr isis on people’s food  security and other basic needs.  
The country remained among the few countries without a single registered Covid-
19 case, despite credible reports clearly indicating otherwise. Authorities tightly control access to information, severely  restrict media and religious freedoms, 
and allow no independent monitoring grou ps. Independent act ivists, including 
in exile, and their relatives were subject to government reprisals. Dozens of peo-ple remained victims of enforced disappearance. The government continued to interfere with people’s right to freedom of movement. 
Covid-19 Response  
Despite authorities’ refusal to acknowledge Covid-19 cases in Turkmenistan, 
media outlets reported that hospitals are overwhelmed with patients with Covid-19 symptoms and there is a serious short age of drugs to treat them. The number 
of Covid-19 deaths is unknown. Turkmen.news, a Netherlands-based outlet, cre-ated an online memorial to 55 people who died  of Covid-19 like symptoms. The 
government-imposed lockdowns in some di stricts in August, expanded them in 
September throughout the country, and  
continued to threaten and jail people for openly demanding access to informa-
tion about the spread of Covid-19. The authorities continued to require the burn-ing of harmala plants in such public spaces as hospitals, shops, and the like, alleging, with no evidence, that  the smoke has disinf ecting properties.  
Meanwhile, the gov ernment has taken measures  to prevent Co vid-19. Sinc e July, 
vaccination is mandatory for all citizens above 18, except those who have speci-
fied medical contraindications, such as a history of anaphylaxis, or are pregnant.  
Although no formal  punishment  was intr oduced for refus ing vaccination, authori-
ties have threatened people who refuse va ccination with criminal charges for 
malicious refusal of treatment for an infectious disease, which is punishable by 
672WORLD REPORT 2022a maximum two-year prison term, higher if there are aggravating circumstances.  
In August, Radio Azatlyk, the Turkmen-language service of the US government-funded Radio Liberty, reported that  authorities in Lebap region fined people and 
threatened to withhold pensions for re fusing to be vaccinated. Police fined peo-
ple for not we aring masks, and unvaccinat ed civil ser vants were thr eatened with 
dismissal. Authorities occasionally imposed  internal travel bans on people 
above 50 and rest rictions on prison visits, parcels and correspondence, citing 
Covid-19 related quarantine measures. As of August  29, 52 percent of the popu-lation has been fully vaccin ated. No data  has been reported since then. 
Food Insecurity  
Turkmen authorities did not acknowledge a ri se in poverty due to the pandemic 
and the shrinking availability of affordable food in the country and failed to en-
sure an adequate standard of living and the right to food to economically vulner-
able groups.  
In some parts of the country, state-subsidized food staples were unavailable for 
months at a time. Meanwhile, the dem and for state-subs idized food  has in-
creased. Authorities threatened and detained  shoppers who vented their frustra-
tion in long lines outside supermarkets.  
The Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights, a Vienna-based group, found the au-
thorities’ policy of delivering subsidized f oods to households, introduced in 
spring 2021, proved inefficient, leav ing some households with no subsidized 
food. In-store purchases of subsidized food were subject to heavily staggered schedules.  
Civil Society  
The government does not allow an y vestige of independent civil society expres-
sion. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are prohibited unless registered, 
and the registration procedure is bu rdensome. International human rights NGOs 
are denied acces s. Act ivists face a constant threa t of gov ernment reprisal. Turk-
men authorities force diss idents and act ivists in exi le into silence, including by 
targeting their relatives.  
673HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn September 2020, Nurgeldy Halykov, 26, a freelance correspondent with the in-
dependent Turkmen.news, was sent enced to a four-ye ar prison term on fabri-
cated fraud charges. Police arrested Halykov in July 2020, shortly after Turkmen.news published a photo it rece ived from him of the World Health Orga-
nization’s (WHO) delegation du ring its 2020 Cov id-19-related visi t to Turk-
menistan.  
Activist Murad D ushemov was fined and ja iled in two separ ate incidents  after 
publicly questioning the authorities’ claim about the absence of Covid-19 in Turkmenistan and refusing to comply with Covid-19 related rules. He received a four-ye ar prison term on tru mped up extortion and b attery char ges stemming 
from an alleged fight with a cellmate during his 15-day jail sentence, which ac-tivists s aid was a provocation.  
Turkmen authorities repeatedly retaliated against the Turkmenistan-based rela-
tives of Turkmens living abroad who criticize the government. In May, security of-ficials questioned  and threatened  a 14 -year-old boy in re taliation for the 
outspoken views of his un cle, Rozybai Jumam uradov, a Turkmen act ivist in exile. 
In March, unidentified people called the boy’s family and threatened to kill them 
unless they ceased communicating with Jumamuradov. The Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF), a human rights organization in exile, and the Memo-rial Human Rights Center, an independent Russi an group, reported in July that 
Turkmen authorities repeated ly harassed and  intimidated Aziza Khemraev a in re-
taliation for the activities of her brother based in Turkey, who actively criticizes the Turkmen government online. In October , the two organizations reported 
more incidents of such harass ment, including Turkmen security  services pressur-
ing Tazegul Ovezova to convince her son, a blogger living in Turkey, to end his ac-tivism.  
On August 1 in Istanbul, Turkey, unknown individuals attacked a group of Turk-
men migrant workers, preventing them from holding a rally at the Turkmen con-
sulate there. Turkish police briefly detained about 10 Turkmen nationals who attempted to participate in the protest . Unidentified men beat and stabbed Aziz 
Mammedov, after he posted online a video of the attack. Three men lured blog-
ger Farhad Durdyev into the consul ate, where several people, including diplo-
mats, beat  and threatened him for several  hours. Durdyev was released several 
hours later, after Turkish police intervened.   
674WORLD REPORT 2022Pygambergeldy Allaberdyev, a lawyer , sentenced in September 2020 on trumped 
up charges to a six-year prison term for alleged c onnections with activis ts of the 
protest mov ement abroad remained  imprisoned. Mansur Mengelov, an activist 
for Baloch minority  rights, continued to serve h is 22-year prison term, handed 
down in 2012, on bogus narcotics charges.    
The fate and whereabouts of Omriuazk Omarkulyev, who had created an informal 
Turkmen students’ club in Turkey, remain unclear. In 2018 Omarkulyev went missing after authorities had lured him into into returning to Turkmenistan and then banned him from retu rning to Turkey. The authoritie s claimed  he was per-
forming his obligatory military service, but independent sources reported that he was sent enced to 20 years in prison on unknown ch arges. In October , a govern-
ment spokesperson publicly stated that Om arkulyev finished his military service 
and was living w ith his f amily. However,  this could not  be independently con-
firmed.  
Freedom of Media and Information 
Turkmenistan has one of the world’s worst  media freedom record s. All print and 
electronic media are tightly controlled  or owned by the state. Authorities rou-
tinely suppress independent voices and sev erely retaliate against Turkmen na-
tionals who report for foreign outlets.  
Internet access in Turkmenistan is highly censored. Many websites and applica-
tions are blocked. Authorities closely monitor all means of communication. Al-
though Turkmen law does not explicitly ban Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), it bans “uncertified” encryption programs and criminalizes “deliberately providing illegal services that provide technical programs” online, for which the maximum penalty is seven years in prison. The authorities systematically block VPNs and intimidate and penalize people who allegedly  use them. Azatlyk reported in April 
that police in eastern Turkmenistan issued warnings to and fined at least two high school teachers because about a do zen of their students were allegedly 
suspected to have been using VPNs on their mobile phones. 
In January police confiscated mobiles of 10th and 11th graders in one of Ashga-
bat’s schools, reportedly following security services’ orders to c heck their photo 
and video content, and websites accessed. Azatlyk reported that at least one 
675HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHparent was able to obtain the retu rn of his child’s sm artphone after paying an 
administrative fine. 
In May, the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR), an exiled group, and 
the International Partnership for Hum an Rights (IPHR) reported that between De-
cember 2020 and March 2021 internet users were summoned, questioned, and intimidated by security services for using VPNs and in March authorities ramped 
up efforts to block VPN access. 
In May, TIHR reported that its  website was subject to di stributed denial-of- ser-
vice (DDOS) attack. 
Freedom of Movement 
Turkmen authorities impose arbitrary travel b ans on various groups of people 
and violate people’s right to freedom of movement.  
In July, Radio Azatlyk reported that authoritie s in one region orally ordered public 
sector workers to turn their passports  over to migration authorities and stated 
they would not issue or renew p assports for these workers.  
The Turkmen government  has not res ponded to a 2019 Unit ed Nations Human 
Rights Committee (UNHRC) request for inform ation regarding the case of the Ruz-
imatov family, relatives of a former official who has emigrated. Authoritie s have 
banned the family from traveling abroad since 2003.  
The government’s continued refusal to renew expiring passports continued to 
deprive many Turkmen citizens living abroad of their right to freedom of move-ment and interfered with their ability to obtain legal status in host countries, ex-posing them to the risk of a range of human rights violations. Following June amendments to the migration law, authorities began extending the validity of passports with an expiration date of January 1, 2020, through December 30, 2022.
 The extension applies mainly to peop le stranded due to the Covid-19 pan-
demic and does not address the needs of  many Turkmen emigrants whose pass-
ports have expired and who have no plans to return to Turkmenistan. 
Freedom of Religion 
Turkmenistan bans unregistered congregations  or religious group s, and registra-
tion requirements are cumber some. Unregistered activity is forbidden and pun-
676WORLD REPORT 2022ishable by administrative penalties and authorities often use pretexts to crimi-
nally prosecute people for their presumed  religious affiliations or practices. The 
government censors all religious literature.  
Forum 18, an independent religious freedom grou p, reported in May that 16 men, 
all Jehovah’s Witnesses, jailed for conscientious objection, had been amnestied. 
Dozens of Muslims, including Bahrom Sap arov, continue to serve long prison 
terms on politically motivate d religious “extremism” char ges related to their reli-
gious practice and affiliations. 
In January 2021 police in Lebap region detained about 10 Muslims allegedly for 
“following their [Muslim] faith too closely,” forcibly shaved off one man’s beard, forced him to drink alcohol, and fined  him on unknown grou nds. In a separate 
incident also in January, 10 other Muslims who had gathered to pray, were de-tained by police allegedly for violation of lockdown restrictions, although no lockdown restrictions were in place at the time.  
Political Prisoners, Enforced Disappearances, Torture,  
Rule of Law  
Authorities continued to conceal the fate and whereabouts of dozens of people, 
who disappeared in Turkmen prisons following convictions on what appear to be politically motivated charges. The exact number of political prisoners remains 
unknown due to the lack of transparency in the justice system and closed nature 
of trials in sensitive cases. The government imprisons people who expose injus-
tices, incompetence and corruption. Torture and ill-treatment in custody persist. 
Dozens of prisoners who have been denied access to family and lawyers, re-
mained victims of enforced disappearance or held incommunicado, following convictions in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The international Prove They Are Alive campaign, which seeks to end enforced disappearances in Turkmenistan, estimates that at least 120 people have been forcibly disappeared. The fate and whereabouts of at least nine disappeared  persons whose terms expired or were 
scheduled to expire in 2021, remain unknown. 
Azat Isakov went missing in Turkmenistan after Russian authorities returned him 
to Turkmenistan in October. Isakov, who had been living in Russia, actively criti-cized the Turkmen government and was presumed to ha ve been taken into cus-
677HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtody upon arriva l in Turkmenistan. At  time of writing, there was no information 
about his fate or whereabouts. 
In July, police arrested Khursanai Ismatullaeva, a doctor, one day after a human 
rights defender participating in a European Parliament (EP) panel discussed her 
unsuccessful efforts to get reinstate d after being unfairly fired from her job. In 
August, a court sentenced her to nine years in prison on presumably bogus fraud charges. 
Political diss ident Gulgeldy Annaniazov, who s hould have been released in 
March 2019 after serving his full 11-year sentence on politically  motivated 
charges, remains  on a five-year t erm of forced internal ex ile. H is health has sig-
nificantly deteriorated.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Consensual same-sex conduct between men is a criminal offense under Turkmen 
law, punishable by a maximum two-year prison sentence. In September, accord-ing to Turkmen News, police in Turkmenab at detained approximately 20 men 
suspected of having sex with other men. In August, police in Turkmenabat de-
tained a well-known barber and stylist in a similar raid and allegedly tried to compel him to name other men believed to be gay. As of end of October 2021 they remained in custody.  
Key International Actors 
In July, the World Bank approved a US$20 million loan to the Turkmen govern-ment for “preparedness agains t the health and social risks of the COVID-19 pan-
demic.” The loan is intended to, among other things, “provid[e] COVID-19-related care to all citiz ens, including vulnerable population groups.” 
There is no information available about ho w the bank will ensure people get 
Covid-19-related care while the authoritie s deny any Covid-19 infections in the 
country. 
During its annual human rights dialogue with Turkmenistan in June, the Euro-
pean Union stressed the need for concrete improvements in human rights and the importance of the full independence of the Ombudsperson’s office and 
678WORLD REPORT 2022called for strengthened cooperation with the United Nations to tackle enforced 
disappearances. Ratification of a bilater al partnership and cooperation agree-
ment between the EU and Turkmenistan remains pending since 2010 due to Turk-menistan’s poor human rights record. 
The US State Department r edesignated Turkmenistan as “a country of particular 
concern” for religious freedom. In June, the US  State Department’s Trafficking in 
Persons Report re-designated Turkmenist an a Tier 3 country, for its insufficient 
efforts to elimin ate human traffic king.  A June st atement by the US miss ion to the 
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) expressed concerns about ‘the severe restrictions of human rights and fundamental freedoms…’ and about enforced disappearances. 
Despite a standing invitation of the Turkmen government since 2018 to all UN 
special procedures to visi t the country, 15 United Nations spec ial procedures 
have requested, but have not been granted, access to the country. 
679HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUganda 
There was a mark ed deterior ation in Uganda’s  human rights en vironment over 
the past year. President  Yoweri Museveni was r e-elected in January 2021 in a 
general election marred by widespread abuses . Security forces arbitrarily ar-
rested and beat opposition supporters and journalists, killed protesters, and disrupted opposition rallies. 
Shortly before the elections, the government shut down the internet for five 
days, and restricted access to social media sites including Twitter and YouTube for a month. The authorities indefinitely 
blocked access to Facebook  after the 
network announced it had taken down a netw ork of accounts and pages linked 
to the government. 
The authorities in Uganda restricted right to  freedom of movement and assem-
bly, in particular for political opposition leaders, and violated rights to freedoms 
of association and expression, as security forc es beat and at times arbitrarily de-
tained journalists and opposition members. 
Freedom of Expression and Assembly  
Two days before the January 14, 2021, elections, the Uganda Communications 
Commission ordered internet service provider s to block social media access. The 
next day, the government s hut down internet access across the country for five 
days . The authorities restored partial access to social media websites , excluding 
Facebook, in February. During election campaigns, the authorities restricted media coverage of opposition party c andidates, in some instances beating and 
shooting at journalists with rubber bullets. 
In February 2021, military police 
beat at least 10 journalists  covering opposition 
presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi, as he delivered a petition to the United Nations Office  of the High Comm issioner for Human Rights  in Kampala 
over the abuses against his supporters. The next day, the army announced that a military court had sentenced seven mem bers of the military police to two 
months detention in a military facility but provided no details on its investiga-tions or the military trial. 
680WORLD REPORT 2022Security forces conducted a spate of abductions and arrests  of opposition sup-
porters, government critics, and other peop le for allegedly participating in 
protests over the November 18, 2020 arrest of Kyagulanyi in Luuka, Eastern Uganda. On March 4, 2021, Internal Affair s Minister Jeje Odongo presented a list 
to parliament of 177 people in milit ary detention who had been arrested between 
November 18, 2020, and February 8, 2021, allegedly for participating in the protests as well as for being in “posse ssion of military stores,” and “meetings 
planning post-election violence.” On March 8, in a public letter to the media, President Yoweri Museveni said that 50 people were being held by the Special Forces Command, a unit of the Ugandan army, for “treasonable acts of elements of the opposition.” 
In May 2021, police 
detained 24 -year-old law student Mich ael Muhima  for a 
tweet parody ing the police spokesperson, char ged him with “off ensive  commu-
nication,” and denied him access to lawyers or family for five days before he was 
released on bail. 
The government in June cancelled a social media tax  requiring users of What-
sApp, Twitter, and Facebook, among other sites, to pay a daily fee of 200 Ugan-dan Shillings (US$0.05) that had been in force since 2018, and replaced it with a general 12 per cent tax on the purchase of internet data, further 
restricting ac-
cess to many Ugandans .  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Uganda’s penal code punishes “carnal knowledge” between people of the same 
gender with up to life in prison. On May 3, Parliament approved the 2021 Sexual 
Offenses Bill  which proposed to criminalize a ll sexual relations between people 
of the same gender, anal sex between people of any gender, and sex work. Presi-
dent Museveni later declined to sign the Bill and returned it to Parliament  on Au-
gust 17 for reconsideration. 
In May 2021, police raided a private celebration at the Happy Family Youth shel-
ter in Wakiso District and arrested 44 people, initially accusing them of holding a 
same-sex wedding, then charged them with “negligent  acts likely to spread in-
fection of disease.” Police subjected 17 of the accused to forced anal examina-
681HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtions. A court dismissed the charges against them on September 23 following 
the prosecution’s failure to present witnesses. 
Women’s Rights 
In August 2021, following a petition fr om women’s rights organizations, lawyers 
and act ivists, the Constitution al Court annulled the 2014 Anti-Pornography Act . 
The Act criminalized the sharing of nude photos and in some instances, was used to arrest women whose intimate photos  were leaked online. The Court also 
disbanded the nine-member Pornography Control Committee, set up in 2017 to enforce the law.  
Arrest and Harassment of Opposition Members and 
Supporters  
In the leadup to Uganda’s January 2021 elections, security forces beat and ar-
rested scores of opposition supporters and journalists, killed dozens, and dis-rupted opposition rallies. Presidential candid ates, Patrick Amuriat, of the Forum 
for Democratic Change and, Robert Kyagulanyi of the National Unity Platform were among those arrested.  
On January 8, police 
charged 49 National Unity Platform supporters  with alleged 
possession of ammunition belonging to the Ugandan army. On January 9, secu-
rity officials surrounded Kyagulanyi’s  home and prevented  people from entering 
or exiting for days, including the United States Ambassador to Uganda, Natalie E. Brown. Media 
reported that soldiers beat Fran cis Zaake , an opposition mem-
ber of parliament, when he attempted to  visit Kyagu lanyi. On January 18, sec urity 
forces blocked access to Kyagulanyi’s party’s head office in Kampala, allegedly to “counter any pl ans to violent demonstrations and mass riots.” 
Attacks on Civil Society  
The authorities restricted the w ork of act ivists and civil society  groups. On elec-
tion day, January 14, police arrested over 20 people working with Citizen Watch-IT and the Women’s Democracy Network, election monitoring groups, for allegedly operating a “parallel tallying center.” 
682WORLD REPORT 2022On February 17 , 2021, the government indefinitely suspended the Democratic 
Governance Facility (DGF)  in Uganda, a European Union donor fund for non-
governmental groups, saying the government lacked oversight over the fund. 
Ugandan authorities on August 20, 2021, announced, without prior notification, 
that they had halted the activ ities of 54 civil society groups , including human 
rights and election monitoring organizations. The National Bureau for Non-gov-ernmental Organizations, a state regulatory body, only started notifying the groups hours or even days after the announcement.  
Forced Evictions  
Following years of forced evictions carried out by security forces in Apaa, North-
ern Uganda, thousands of eligible voters we re unable to participate in the 2021 
elections because Ug anda’s Elect oral C ommiss ion updated the national voters’ 
register, but excluded Apaa.  
On August 12, President Museveni met with nine leaders from Acholi sub-region  
to discuss Apaa. During the meeting the leaders agreed to establish a commis-sion of inquiry into the evictions, the land dispute, how long people have lived in the area, and re view the proce ss of the gov ernment’s 2002 decision to turn 
Apaa into forestry and wildlife re serves. In the same meeting, Museveni directed 
the environment minister to evict people fr om Zoka forest, in the north of Apaa, 
claiming it is a forestry reserve. 
Prosecutions for Serious Crimes  
On February 4, 2021, International Criminal Court (ICC) judges convicted Dominic 
Ongwen , a former leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, on 61 counts of war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. The crimes include attac ks on the civi lian 
population, murder, torture, persecution, forced marriage, forced pregnancy, sexual slavery, enslavement, rape, pillage, destruction of property, and recruit-ment and use of children under the age of 15 to participate in the hostilities. On 
May 6, ICC judges 
imposed a 25 -year- sentence  on Ongwen, the first conviction 
and sentencing of an LRA leader.  
683HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHJospeh Kony, the LRA’s founding leader and the only living remaining ICC suspect 
of LRA crimes, remains a fugitive. 
Wider accountability for crimes committed during the 25 -year c onflict in northern 
Uganda remains limited. Abuses by the Ugandan armed forces during the con-flict, including tor ture, rape, arbitra ry detention, unlawful killing s, and forced 
displacement of citizens, have rarely  been prosecuted. The Ugandan army has 
said that soldiers who committed these a buses have been prosecuted and con-
victed but has not provided det ails of such cases.  
Uganda’s Int ernational  Crimes D ivision, which was established in 2008, has pur-
sued only one case involving crimes committed in northern Uganda, against LRA 
commander Tho mas Kwoyelo . The tr ial has 
proceeded in fits and starts, suffering 
many delays . Some former LRA fighters, including senior commanders, were in-
tegrated into the Ugandan military w ithout investigation into crimes they may 
have committed in the LRA.  
In December 2020, the ICC prosecutor’s office concluded an assessment of a 
2016 police and military operation in west ern Uganda in which about 150 people 
were killed. The prosecutor’s office fo und Ugandan security forces committed 
murder and u sed indisc riminate and di sproportionate force but was unable to 
conclude that the acts took place as part of a policy, a necessary element for the ICC’s juri sdiction. There has been no domestic accounta bility for the crimes. 
Children’s Rights 
To stop the spread of Covid-19, President Museveni ordered the closure of all 
schools on March 18, 2020, affecting more than 15 million students. Schools were partially open for un iversity, secondary and primary c andidate classes in 
2021, but largely remained closed since the pandemic’s start in 2020. On Sep-tember 22, President Museveni announced the reopening of post-secondary in-stitutions in November 2021, and other schools at the beginning of January 2022.  
Uganda adopted unive rsal primary education in 1997  and universal secondary 
education in 2007 , abolishing tuition fees and  prohibiting schools from introduc-
ing other costs that could create b arriers for students from low-income house-
holds and those living in poverty. In practic e, many public schools still levy fees. 
684WORLD REPORT 2022Prohibitive school fees and the under-resourcing of public primary and second-
ary schools are significant b arriers for many children.  
Child labor  rates rose in 2020 as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, 
together with school closu res and in adequate government  assist ance, pushed 
children into exploitative and dangerous work. Work ing children told Human 
Rights Watch that in addition to helping their family during the Covid-19 pan-demic, they also hoped to save money to cover school fees once schools re-opened.  
685HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUkraine 
The armed conflict in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine continued to pose a 
grave threat to civi lian safety and impede acce ss to food , adequate hou sing, and 
schools. Covid-19 pandemic -related travel restrictions, introduced by Russia-
backed armed groups and the government, blocked access to health care and pensions and worsened hardships for the already impoverished population of 
the conflict-affected Donbas.   
Armed groups forc ibly dis appeared, tor tured, and arbitr arily detained  civilians 
and repeatedly denied some of them access to urgent medical care.  
A bill ref orming Ukraine’s notoriously a busive secu rity service adv anced in par-
liament despite human rights concerns.  
Members of groups advocating hate and discrimination continued putting ethnic 
minorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and rights ac-tivists at ris k, subjecting them to physical attacks and hate speech. 
Armed Conflict  
A spike in hostilities, despite the ceasefir e, led to civili an casualties. According 
to United Nations hum an rights monitoring m ission r eports, in the fi rst six 
months of 202 1, 56 civi lians were kil led or injured by s helling, sma ll arms  
weapons fire, mine-related incidents, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) 
strikes.  
Russia-backed armed groups in Donetska  and Luhanska regions continued to 
torture, arbitrarily det ain, and forc ibly dis appear civilians and to deny them ac-
cess to medical care. As of July, an estimated 300-400 conflict -related detainees 
were  being held by these armed groups.  
There were no reports of prolonged  arbitrary detention by the Ukrainian authori-
ties in 2021. The investigation into alleged grave  abuses in unofficial detention 
facilitie s by Ukr aine’s secret services in 2016 remained open and  has borne no 
results.  
Excessive  and arbitra ry rest rictions imposed  by armed groups in Donestska and 
Luhanska regions c ontinue to unduly burden civili ans. The Ukrainian govern-
686WORLD REPORT 2022ment ended  most Covid-19-related restrictions in June. In welcome moves, in Au-
gust the authorities temporarily suspended  the requirement for pensioners re-
siding in nongov ernment- control led areas to  regularly confirm displac ed person 
registration and in September, announced plans  to introduce remote identity 
verification. If enacted, the latter step would help  address discrimination against 
pensioners residing in nongovernment-controlled areas, in particular helping to eliminate barriers that pensioners 
who cannot travel  due to limited mobility have 
faced accessing their pensions since 2014. 
Lack of access to quality health care remained a key concern for conflict-affected 
parts of eastern Ukraine, where a pproximately  1.3 million people continued to 
face difficulties in accessing essential health services. Women have been dispro-portionately impacted, due in part to limit ed options for maternal and other sex-
ual and reproductive healthcare in these regions, the poor quality of these 
services, and traditional gender roles that leave women with little time and few resources to prioritize and address their own health. 
Rule of Law, Administration of Justice  
In October 2020, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine stripped  the national anti-
corruption agency of its essential powers, effectively dismantling the system of publicly accessib le asset decla rations. The ruling was followed by President Ze-
lensky’s bill to terminate the Constitutional Court’s powers. Zelensky withdrew 
the bill in January.  
The trial of four defendants over the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 
MH17 advanced to evidentiary hearings.  
An October 2020 
draft law  meant to reform the Security Service of Ukraine pro-
gressed in parliament, despite granting the agency overly broad powers without sufficient human rights safeguards.  
The criminal case involving the 2014 abduction and  torture of two Maidan pro-
testors, which resulted in the death of one of them 
progressed  in April, with two 
men arrested and charged. Also in April, a district court sentenced a leader of 
the responsible group to nine years in prison. The group, known as “titushky”  consisted of anti-Maid an act ivists rec ruited by law enforc ement to att ack pro-
testers during Maidan protests. 
In December  2020, the State Bureau of Investi-
687HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHgations indict ed a Maidan activist on homicide charges in connection with the 
February 2014 arson of the Party of Regions office. 
There has been no further progress  in investigations and trials related to the 
2014 Odesa clashes. 
A January European Court of Human Rights decision   found that the Ukrainian 
government committed  multiple breaches of the European Convention on 
Human Rights in the course of public order operations during the Maidan protests, including the right to life, the prohib ition of torture, and the right to lib-
erty and security.  
In May, parliament 
adopted  a long overdue law aligning Ukraine’s national legis-
lation with international law to allow for effective domestic prosecutions of grave 
international crimes, including those committed in Donbas and Crimea. At time 
of writing, because Zelens ky has not signed  the law, it  has not gone into effect. 
Additional changes are likely to be needed to the Criminal Procedural Code to support effective investigations and prosecutions.  
In late June, Ukraine’s prosecutor general  removed Gyunduz Mamedov as direc-
tor of the government’s specialized w ar crimes department. Human rights and 
watchdog groups criticized 
the de cision as groundless and politically motivated. 
Freedom of Expression, Attacks on Journalists  
Physical attacks and online threats against human rights defenders, anti-corrup-
tion act ivists, envi ronmental act ivists, and independent jo urnalists have been 
numerous while investigations  into the incidents have been slow, and at times 
ineffective. As of September , the Institute of Mass information, a watchdog 
group, recorded 73 cases of obstruction of journalists’ professional activities, 17 
beatings, 12 threats, and 11 restrictions on access to information. 
A suspect in the 2016 kil ling of journali st Pavel Sher emet was released  from de-
tention and placed under house arrest in April, pending trial. One other suspect remains u nder house arrest, and the thir d one was rel eased on bail in May 2020. 
The investig ation into the 2018 killing of  activist Kateryna Handziuk has led to 
prison sentences for five men. However, pr ogress in efforts to charge those al-
legedly respons ible for ordering the att ack has been slow.  
688WORLD REPORT 2022A February decree by Zelensky led to the extrajudicial banning  of three pro-Rus-
sia television channels and threatened media pluralism  in Ukraine. The decree 
was based on a law that gr ants the gov ernment authority to s anction foreign in-
dividuals and entities that it deems have engaged in activities which could threaten Ukraine’s national interests, nation al security, sove reignty, and territo-
rial integrity.  
Hate Crimes  
In the first half  of 2021, civil society grou ps reported a sharp increase in attacks 
against LGBT, anti-corruption, and women’s rights act ivists, including by far -right 
groups and individuals. 
In May, parliamentary committees began discu ssing a bill that would increase li-
ability for discrimination and intolerance. In April, the Health Ministry lifted re-
strictions against gay people on donating blood.  
In May, LGBT activis ts held a pride march in K yiv in su pport of transgender peo-
ple, under police protection. Far-right  activis ts organiz ed a counter protest but 
did not attack the march. 
The police prevented attempt ed attacks on pride marches in Odesa and Kharkiv, 
held in August and September. In Odes a,  the police arrested over 50 people 
who tried to attack the pride participants. Twenty-nine  officers were injured dur-
ing the clashes.  
In March, members of a far-right group ass aulted six participants of the Women’s 
Rights march in Kyiv. Four  men have been arrested.  
On May 29, far-right groups disrupt ed outdoor ev ents in K yiv and Odessa, held 
by LGBT rights group Insight .  
Also in May, far-right radicals in Kyiv sprayed tear gas at the screening of  a film 
about Ukraine’s LGBT community. Twenty people received minor eye burns.  
The LGBT Association LIGA faced  threats, online bullying, and attacks in Odesa 
and Mykolaiv. In May, masked men threw stones at the building of the LIGA’s of-fice in Odesa, damaging it.  
689HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHRoma people remained a target of online hate speech and occasional physical 
violence. In April, local media publi shed a video from the meeting of the Ivano-
Frankivsk mayor with local po lice, where he order ed them to “move Roma people 
back to Zakarpattya.”  
No progre ss has been made  in ensuring accountability for the 2017 murder of 
Mykola Kaspitsky, the leader of Ro ma community in Kh arkiv r egion. In January 
the case was closed f or the fourth time. Thr oughout the year, activis ts raised 
concerns over the police allegedly sabotaging the case. 
In January. police broke up two protests against far-right groups, under the pre-
text of Covid-19 restrictions, while other protests were allowed to go on unre-
stricted.  
In June, Ukraine repatriated  a mother and her seven children held in dire condi-
tions  in a camp for Islamic State (ISIS) suspects and family members in north-
east Syria. The authorities had repatriate d two other Ukrainian women and seven 
children in 2020. 
Crimea  
Russian authorities in Crimea continued to persecute Crimean Tatars, including 
by conflating religious or political belief s as affiliation with Hizb ut-Tahrir, 
banned in Russia as a “terr orist” organization but legal in Ukraine. Dozens of 
Crimean Tatars continued to serve prison sentences on arbitrary charges for real or perceived affiliation with the organiz ation—many of them members of the 
Crimean Solidarity, a group that supports  Crimean Tatars arrested on politically 
motivated grounds. 
In February  and August, a total of 11 men were arrested on 
similarly spurious claims.  
In September, authorities arrested  Nariman Dzhelyal, one of the few Crimean 
Tatar leaders remaining in Crimea, on trumped-up charges of “aiding sabotage.” Authorities detained four other Crimean Tatars in connection with the case. 
A new wave of house searches in March led to the detention of four men and one 
woman who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, which is banned as “extremist” in Russia. 
In March, a court sentenced Viktor Stashivs kyi to 6.5 years in prison for “organiz-
690WORLD REPORT 2022ing the activities of an extremist organization,” the longest sentence yet given  to 
a Jehovah’s Witness.  
Russian authorities continued to conscript males in occupied Crimea to serve in 
Russia’s armed forces, in violation of international humanitarian law. Conscrip-tion was c arried out in t andem with enli stment adv ertising camp aigns in Crimea 
and military 
propaganda  for schoo lchildren.  
Key International Actors  
In January, the European Court of Human Rights found  a Ukrainian inter-state 
complaint against Ru ssia to be partiall y admissib le. The court rec ognized that 
Russia had “exercised effective control” over Crimea since 2014, paving the way for accountability for violations of the European Convention on Human Rights by Russia during its occupation of the peninsula.  
In April, the European Union issued a statement formally accusing Russian au-
thorities in Crimea of conducting a conscription campaign, labelling it a “viola-tion of international humanitarian law.”  The EU also condemned in September the detention of 
Crimean Tatar  leaders and called for the release  of Ukrainian cit-
izens detained in Crimea. 
In May, during their annual human rights dialogue, the European Union wel-
comed the adoption of Ukraine’s recent National Strategy for Human Rights and the Action Plan, while also calling for further progress in reform of multiple sec-
tors and successful resolution of the Maidan and Odesa investigations. During 
the EU-Ukraine Summit in October, both parties reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the political and economic integration of Ukraine with the EU with-out a particular emp hasis on human rights and  the rule of law issues.  
During their first 
meeting  at the White House in August, US President Joseph 
Biden and President Zelensky committed to upholding human rights in Ukraine , 
including in such ar eas as ref orming the judiciary, co mbatting corru ption and 
fighting discrimination against the LGBT community. The presidents committed to holding Russia accountable for abuses in the territories of Ukraine controlled or occupied by Russia and to seeking the release of political prisoners held there. 
691HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHA July report from the UN H uman Rights Monitoring M ission in Ukraine con-
demned  arbitrary detention and torture by both the Ukrainian government and 
non-government armed groups throughout the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  
The government failed to submit the Co uncil of Europe Convention on the Pre-
vention of Violence against Women and Domes tic Violence (the Istanbul Conven-
tion) to parliament for ratification. Ukraine signed the convention in 2011 and has repeatedly c ommitted to  ratification. 
No public steps were taken to move tow ard a formal investigation following the 
December 2020 announcement by the Office of the Prosecutor at the Interna-tional Criminal Court that the situation in Ukraine merited ICC action.  
692WORLD REPORT 2022United Arab Emirates 
In 2021, United Arab Emirates (UAE) authorities continued to invest in a  “soft 
power” strategy  aimed at p ainting the countr y as a progressiv e, tolerant, and 
rights-respecting nation, yet the UAE’s  intolerance of  criticism was reflected in 
the continued unjust  imprisonment of  leading human rights act ivist A hmed Man-
soor and others. 
The UAE continued to develop its surveillance capabilities, both online and 
through mass facial  recognition  surveillance in public  spaces. New reports 
emerged  of UAE authorities misusing Israeli spyware  to gain access to the pri-
vate and encrypted  communications of  journalists, activis ts, and world leaders.   
In 2021, a UAE Interior Ministry official ran as a candidate  for president of Inter-
pol and won, an appointment that jeopar dizes the global police organization’s 
commitment to its human rights obligations given the UAE state security appara-tus’ long record of multiple abuses.  
The UAE blocked representatives of international human rights organizations 
and UN experts fr om conducting in-country research and visiting prisons and de-
tention facilities. 
Freedom of Expression  
Scores of act ivists, academics, and la wyers are ser ving lengthy sentences in UAE 
prisons following unfair trials on vague and broad charges that violate their rights to free expression and association. 
Ahmed Mansoor, a leading Emirati human rights defender, remained imprisoned 
in an isolation cell for a fourth year. 
New details  regarding UAE authorities’ per-
secution of Mansoor emerged in 2021 revealing grave violations of his rights and demonstrated the State Security Agency’s unchecked powers to commit abuses. In July, a private letter he wrote detailing his mistreatment in detention leaked to 
regional media, sparking 
renewed concern over his well-being and possible re-
taliation .

As of September 2021, UAE authorities  continued to hold  Khalifa al-Rabea, an 
Emirati who completed his sentence on stat e security charges July 2018. Al-
Rabea was conv icted in 2014 ba sed on his ties to al-Islah, which was a legally 
registered Islamist political movement  that the UAE later banned in 2014 as a 
“terrorist entity.” Authorities arbi trarily kept him behind bars for “counselling,” 
according to Emir ati act ivists. Authorities also held  past their sent ences four 
Emirati d issidents convicted  in the UAE 94 trial and  who completed their sen-
tences in 2019 and 2020 and two women prisoners who completed their sen-
tences in 2020.  
In October 2020, a UAE court sentenced  a Jordanian resident of the UAE to 10 
years in prison based entirely on peaceful Facebook posts criticizing Jordan’s government.  
Arbitrary Arrests, Detainee Abuse, and Forcible Deportations  
UAE authorities arbitrarily targeted Pakistani Shia residents by subjecting them 
to enforced disappearance, incommunicado detention, and eventually ground-less deportations. Reports of UAE authoritie s’ arbitrarily targeting Shia resi-
dents, whether Lebanese, Iraqi, Afghan, Pakis tani or otherwise, often emerge at 
times of increased regional tensions.  
In late June, UAE authorities reportedly arrested hundreds of African migrant 
workers from Cameroon, Nigeria, and Ug anda, arbitrarily detained them for 
weeks, and il legally deported them en masse w ithout allow ing them to challenge 
their deportations. Thomson Reuters Foundation reported in September that UAE 
authorities deported Cameroonians despite their stated concerns about ongoing violence back home.  
Especially in cases purportedly related to state security, detainees were at seri-
ous risk of arbitrary and incommunicado detention, torture and ill-treatment, prolonged solitary confinement, and deni al of access to  legal assist ance. 
Forced 
confessions  were used as evidence in trial proceedings, and prisoners com-
plained of overcrowded and unhygienic conditions and inadequate medical care.  
695HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThroughout 2021, UAE  prison authorities denied detainees living with HIV  unin-
terrupted access to lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, in flagrant violation of their right to health and essential medicines. In at least two UAE prisons, de-tainees living with HIV were segregated from the rest of the prison population and faced stigma and systemic discrimination. Prisoners living with HIV in the UAE who have been denied adequate medical care are 
at risk of experiencing se-
rious complications if infected  with the Covid-19 virus. 
Despite international calls to do so, the UAE refused to allow independent inter-
national  monitors to enter the country and  visit prison and detention facilities. 
Unlawful Attacks and Detainee Abuse Abroad 
Despite announcing the withdrawal of most of its ground troops from Yemen in 
2019, the UAE  continued to play a leading role in a coalition conducting military 
operations , and continued to provide support for certain Yemeni forces who 
have  committed grave abuses  over the past several years. In February, Human 
Rights Watch  reported  on the detention of a Yemeni jo urnalist who was first 
threatened by an official from the UAE and detained and mistreated by UAE-backed forces. 
In Libya, the UAE conducted air and drone strikes, some of which killed and 
wounded civili ans. The strikes were in support of  the Libyan Arab Armed Forces 
(LAAF), the eastern-based armed group under the command of General Khalifa Hiftar and one of two major Libyan parties to the armed conflict that began in April 2019 .   
Migrant Workers  
Foreign nationals accounted for more th an 80 percent of the UAE’s population, 
according to 2015 International Labour Organization figures. 
The  kafala  (sponsorship) system tied migrant work ers’ visas to their employers,  
preventing them from ch anging or leaving employers without  permiss ion. Those 
who left their employers  without perm ission face d punis hment for “abscond-
ing,” including fines, arrest, detention, and deportation, all without any due 
696WORLD REPORT 2022process guarantees. Many lo w-paid migrant workers were  acutely vulnerable to 
forced labor. 
The UAE’s labor law excluded from its pr otections domestic workers, who faced a 
range of abuses, from unpaid wage s, confinement to the house, and workdays 
up to 21 hours to physical and sexual  assault by employer s. Domestic workers 
faced legal and practical obstacles to redress. While  a 2017 law  on domestic 
workers guarantees some labor rights, it is weaker than the labor law and falls short of international standards. 
The Covid-19 p andemic has fur ther exposed and  amplified the wa ys in which mi-
grant workers’ rights are violated. T ens of thousands of migrant workers 
lost their 
jobs and were trapped  in the country in dire conditions. Many lived through strict 
lockdowns in crowded and unh ygienic housing. While thousands left the UAE  
after facing summary dismissals, many struggled to return to their home coun-tries because of travel restrictions and  expensive  plane tickets, and  many were 
left unable to pay rent or buy food. Ma ny migrant workers also faced unpaid 
wages for work they had done before being dismissed.  
Authorities imposed stricter Covid-19 lockd own conditions on domestic workers 
than other migrant workers, 
advising  employers not to allow their domestic 
workers to meet anyone outside. Given that  many employers already confine do-
mestic workers to the household and overwork them, such conditions left them 
even more at risk of abuse, including inc reased working hours, no rest days, and 
physical and verbal abuse. 
In September, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor and ImpACT International docu-
mented  that on June 24 and 25 authorities ar rested, detained, and tortured over 
800 African migrant  workers before the mass deportation of many . The organiza-
tions report that the majority were deported despite valid residence visas and/or work permits, and that an unknown number remain in detention.  
Climate Change Policies and Impacts  
As one of the world’s top 10 crude oil pr oducers—and a top five per capita emit-
ter of green house gases—UAE is cont ributing to the climate crisis that is taking a 
mounting to ll on human rights around  the globe. The UAE has tak en some posi-
tive steps to  reduce em issions, including incr eased renew able energy capacity 
697HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHand removing some fossil fuel  subsidies. Yet it maintains plans for significant 
fossil fuel use and production, both for export and domestic purposes.  
Its 2020 update to its national clim ate action plan—which pledges to reduce 
emissions by 23.5 percent by 2030—is “insufficient” to meet the Paris Agree-ment’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C  above pre-industrial levels, accord-
ing to the Climate Action Tracker.  
The UAE is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including 
from extreme heat, increased droughts, and sea level rise, requiring the UAE to take steps to protect at-risk populations from their foreseeable harms. Eighty-five percent of its population lives along co astlines that are just several meters 
above sea level.  
Women’s Rights  
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women com-menced its proc ess to review the UAE’s  five-ye ar women’s rights re cord.  While 
the UAE has m ade a few reforms, it continues to  discrimin ate against women in 
law and practice.  
Some provis ions of the law regulating person al status  matters discrimin ate 
against women. For a woman to marry,  her male guardian must conclude her 
marriage contract. Men can unilateral ly divorc e their wives, wher eas a woman 
must apply for a court order to obtain a divorce. A woman can lose her right to maintenance if, for example, she refuses to have sexual relations with her hus-
band without a lawful excuse.  
Although changes to the law in 2020 repealed  provisions that c riminalized extra-
marital sex, the authorities 
still make it difficult  for unmarried pregnant women 
to access prenatal healthcar e and register their children. Official government 
websites  still require marriage certificate to obtain birth certificates of their chil-
dren, and health policy directives state that  unmarried females should not be of-
fered maternity insurance cover, as well as hospitals that still require marriage 
certificates for women to access some forms  of sexual and reproductive health-
care. 
In November 2020, the UAE also repealed an article in the penal code that al-
lowed men to receive lighter sentences for killing a female relative if they found 
698WORLD REPORT 2022them in the act of extramarital sex. However, the law still allows families of the 
murder victim to waive their right to see the person punished in return for com-pensation (blood money) or choose to freely pardon them. In such cases, the ac-
cused can be subject to a minimum sentence of seven years in prison instead of life. When family members kill a wom an, including in so-called “honor” killings, 
the victim’s family is also the family of the murderer and is likely to allow men to 
receive lighter sentences. 
The UAE’s nationality 
law provides that children of  Emirati men are automatically 
entitled to UAE citizenship; however, children born to Emirati mothers and for-eign fathers are not.   The government did not take steps to fulfil its commitment, at its UN Universal Periodic Review in 2018, to ban corporal punishment of children in all settings. 
In February, the BBC 
revealed  secret videos of Sheikha Latifa, daughter of the 
Dubai ruler, detailing her alleged forced confinement in a Dubai villa following 
her abduction and forcib le return in 2018. Since May, Latifa was pictured in malls 
in Dubai and then abroad  with friends on Instagram. It is unclear under what 
conditions she has been granted such freedoms, nor the status  of her sister 
Shamsa who was also subj ect to abduction and forcible return from the UK in 
2000.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Article 358 of the penal code criminalizes a “flagrant indecent act” and any say-ing or act that offends public morals. A 2020 decree amending the penal code changed the punishment from a minimum of six months to a fine of Dh1,000 to Dh50,000 (US$270-$13,000). If it is a repeat ed offense, the punishment is up to 
three months’ imprisonment or Dh100,000 ($27 ,000). In 2020, the UAE also amended article 356 of the penal code to remove language that had previously criminalized the vague offense of consensual indecency or debasement and was used to punish individuals who engaged in consensual sexual relations outside marriage, or zina , with a minimu m one-ye ar prison sentence. 
The UAE’s federal penal code punishes “any male disguised in female apparel 
and enters in this disguise a place reser ved for women or where entry is forbid-
699HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHden, at that time, for other than women” with one year’s imprisonment, a fine of 
up to 10,000 dirhams ($2,723), or both. In practice, transgender women have been arrested under this law even in mixed-gender spaces. 
Key International Actors  
As a party to the armed conflict in Yemen, the US provided logistical and intelli-
gence support to Saudi and UAE-led coalition forces. Human Rights Watch called  
on the Biden administration in December to end arms sales to the UAE  until it 
takes meaningful steps to end abuses in Yemen and act to hold those responsi-ble for war crimes to account. In February, the Biden administration announced that it would end support for “off ensive  operations” in Yemen, but in April the 
administration 
greenlighted  a Trump-era $23 billion arms sale to the UAE that in-
cludes highly advanced aerial weaponry. 
In September, the European Parliament passed a  resolution  calling on its mem-
ber states not to participate in the  Expo 2020  taking place in Dubai between Oc-
tober and March 2022, and for intern ational companies to withdraw their 
sponsorship due to the UAE’s human rights record.  
700WORLD REPORT 2022United Kingdom 
The UK government pursues laws and policies with little regard for their impact 
on human rights. The government cut social security affecting millions despite clear warnings it would increase food  insecurity, debt, and homelessness. The 
response to increased  migrant boat  crossings across the English Channel  was 
draft legislation and proposed pushbacks at odds with refugee and human rights law. A landmark parliamentary oversight 
report  found that existing social, 
economic, and health inequalities and failures in the UK government’s Covid-19 pandemic response led to disproportion ately high death rates among people in 
institutions such as care homes, people with learning disabilities and autism, 
and Black and ethnic minority people. The government again failed to take meaningful steps to tackle institutional racism. Although the UK government worked in coalition with partners to call out human rights abuses on key issues, when weighed against other interests, it did not always prioritize human rights 
in its foreign policy agenda. 
The Rule of Law and Human Rights  
In March, the government published  an independent review of the power of 
courts to hold the executive to account. It recommended only modest changes to judicial review and while the 
legal profession  remains cautious  about the gov-
ernment’s intentions, its proposals for legislative change  are more limited  than 
initially feared. 
A separate review into the Human Rights Act was ex pected to publi sh its findings 
in late 2021. Although the government says it intends to remain party to the Eu-ropean Convention on Human Rights, the ruling Conservative party’s track record of hostility to the act and 
comments from the justice minister  raised concerns 
that the review could be used to wa ter down rights and other legal protections. 
Asylum and Migration  
The UK ratcheted up rhetoric and efforts  to restrict arrivals of migrants and peo-
ple seeking asylum crossing the English Channel from France in small boats, raising concerns for the rights and safety  of people making the dangerous jour-
701HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHney. By the end of September, an estimated 17 ,085 people  had crossed the 
Channel in this way during 2021. After announcing plans to push back such boats into French t erritorial waters in September, UK border enforcement guards 
were filmed conducting 
drills  in which they appeared to practice potentially dan-
gerous techniques such as pushing and  ramming boats with jet-skis.  
Measures proposed in a draft migration law in July would undermine interna-
tional refugee and human rights obligations, including further criminalizing peo-ple seeking a sylum (increas ing the sentence for “illegal  entry,” penalizing 
people based on their mode of arr ival, and broadening the definition of “assist-
ing unla wful immigration”); al lowing offshore proce ssing and det ention of asy-
lum-seekers; creating a discriminatory, two-tier system of protection based on 
how a person sought safety in the UK; increasing m aritime pushback powers; 
and providing immu nity to border guards  from civi l or criminal proceedings aris-
ing from engaging in maritime pushbacks.  
The Nationality and Borders Bill was 
widely criticized  by the UN refugee agency  
and domestic civil society groups . At time of writing, the bi ll was being examined  
by the parliamentary human rights committee. 
UK authorities pledged to resettle 5,000 Afghan refugees in 2021 and a further 
15,000 within five years following the Taliban’s seizure of power and the NATO troop withdrawal, in addition to facilitating the evacuation of nationals and Afghans who ar e eligible u nder the UK’s Af ghan Relocations  and Assis tance Pol-
icy.  
A Home Office scheme, set up in 2019 to compensate a group of Black British cit-
izens, known as the “Windrush generation,” wrongly threatened with deporta-tion or deported from the UK, continued its work, but faced criticism from 
victims  
and a parliamentary oversight committee  for being too slow. Two men, aged 55 
and 67 , from the Windrush generation began litigation  in September seeking 
greater transparency on the pr ocess for expediting urgent claims.  
Rights to Social Security,  Adequate Standard of Living  
In October, the government cut up to £1,040 (US$1,439) per year from social se-
curity support to people on the Universal Credit system, despite widespread 
warnings  that doing so would further exacerbate poverty. The government ar-
702WORLD REPORT 2022gued it was ending a temporary Cov id-19 relief measure, but fa iled to di sclose its 
impact assessment  of the cut on approximately 6 million people. Domestic civil 
society groups  and frontline professionals pr edicted the step would increase 
food insecurity, debt, and homelessness and harm physical and mental health . 
The UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty warned  that the cut did not com-
ply with the UK’s socioeconomic rights obligations. 
Rights groups raised concerns about people with disabilities receiving inade-
quate social security support, including an estimated 2 million people , many of 
them people with disabilities or long -term health conditions, on “legacy” bene-
fits which predated the Universal Cr edit system, who never received the addi-
tional £1,040 per year. 
Right to Food  
Official data  published in March, but collected prior to the pandemic, showed 43 
percent of households receiving Univers al Credit were experiencing food insecu-
rity. The data showed the disproportion ate impact of food insecurity on families  
headed by a single adult (predominantly w omen) or a Black person, families liv-
ing on less than £200 ($276) per week, and people with disabilities . 
Demand for f ood banks grew as the number of Un iversal Credit claimants  in-
creased to 6 million by March, dou bling since the onset of the pandemic. 
The country’s largest food bank network reported  that it had given out 2.5 million 
emergency food aid packages between April 2020 and March 2021, up 33 per-
cent compared to the prior year, and its data showed lack of income and inade-quate social security support as the main drivers. 
In July, the 
National Food Strategy , an independent review into the country’s 
food systems, recommended removing obstacles  for families seeking free school 
meals for children; ensu ring long-term food  provision f or children during school 
vacations; and extending an existing food su bsidy program for pregnant people 
and families with young children.  
703HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHChildren’s Rights  
In March, Scotland’s parliament passed a law  incorporating the UN Convention 
on the Rights of the Child into Scottish law. In October, the UK Supreme Court 
ruled , following a constitutional challenge by the UK government , that the Scot-
tish legislature had acted beyond its powers  and asked for the legislation to be 
revised. 
In July, the Supreme Court rejected  a human rights challenge to the “two child 
limit” welfare policy, which caps payments to  families with more than two chil-
dren born after April 2017. Although the court a ccepted that the policy dispropor-
tionately affected w omen and children, it found  it objectively justifiable. Official 
statistics  published later that month estim ated that the policy affected 1.1 mil-
lion children  in Great Britain. 
In an important case about access to health care  for trans young people, the 
Court of Appeal affirmed  in September that children under 16 are capable of con-
sent to treatment, and that clinicians rather than courts can determine if they have exercised it. 
The number of people living in “temporary accommodation” or housing or hostel 
places provided by local government f or homeless families increased by 75 per-
cent over the prior decade. Official 
data  published in September estimated that 
30,700 households with children were  living in temporary accommodation in 
London alone and growing up in substandard conditions, due to a lack of suit-able affordable permanent alternatives. Ch ildren faced severe impact on their 
rights to an adequate standard of living and 
education . 
Abortion  
In July, the UK government, using new powers , directed  Northern Ireland authori-
ties to fund and make available abortion services by March 2022. Access to abortion in Northern Ireland limited, with one medical trust unwilling to perform abortions and others underfunded. In October, the Northern Ireland High Court 
ruled  that the UK government had failed to  act “expeditiously” to ensure access 
to abortion services. 
704WORLD REPORT 2022Gender-Based Violence  
The Domestic Abuse Act , which entered into force in April, introduced positive 
changes, including a statutory definition of  “domestic abuse,” new offences, 
better protection in family courts, and e nhanced duties for local authorities to 
support sur vivor s. However, women’s rights organizations  criticized the bill’s 
failure to protect migrant women  adequately. The UK  has not ratified the Council 
of Europe Convention on Preventing Violenc e Against Women and Domestic Vio-
lence (known as the Istanbul Convention), which requires states to ensure such protection. At time of writing, the UK had also not ratified the Violence and Ha-rassment at Work Convention of  the Intern ational Labou r Organization (ILO). 
Following the gov ernment-comm issioned  Rape Review’s 
report  in June, ministers 
apologized for failing rape victims and committ ed to reversing a downward trend 
in rape prosecutions and convictions despite increased reports to police . In July, 
official criminal justice statistics  showed a further drop in proportions of sus-
pects charged with rape or domestic abuse during 2020-21, despite a docu-mented increase in domestic vio lence during the Covid-19 lockdowns. 
At time of writing, 112 women had been killed in the UK in 2021, according to 
Counting Dead Women . They include men killing women walking in public such 
as Sabina Nessa killed by a man five minutes from her home in September, and Sarah Everard , who was kidn apped, raped, and ki lled by a serv ing police officer 
in March. Everard’s killing prompted protests and widespread concern that po-lice are not serious about tackling vi olence against w omen, including by police 
officers. Revelations during the prosecution of Everard’s killer in addition to re-ports from 
former  and serving  female police officers raised alarms about ongo-
ing sexism and misogyny within the police force.  
In October, an employment tribunal in Scotland found  that a female firearms offi-
cer had been victimized  by a sexist workplace cul ture. W omen’s rights activists 
oppose  a policing bill that would not address police failures to tackle violence 
against women and would cu rb other freedoms, including the freedom to 
protest. 
In September, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled  that police had violated 
multiple human rights  of an environment al activis t, when a male police officer 
formed an intimate relationship with her between 2003 and 2005 as part of un-
705HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHdercover po licing practice. The act ivist, Kate Wilson , is one of several women 
who have come forward to report institution ally sexist practices in covert polic-
ing. A broader public inquiry into undercover policing remains ongoing and is ex-pected to report back in 2023. 
Racial and Ethnic Discrimination  
A government- appointed comm ission to review ra cial disp arities received wide-
spread criticism for finding in April that “institutional racism” had largely disap-peared. The Windrush  scandal, multiple government-comm issioned  reports and 
official data indicated that, to the contrary, racial and ethnic disparities con-tinue, including in employment, criminal justice, and health. 
A draft 
policing law  proposed in July drew widespread criticism , including for 
planned curbs to protest rights, and the likely impacts of wider police search powers on people from ethnic minorities, es pecially Black people, and wider 
anti-tresp ass powers on Gypsy, Ro ma, and Tr aveller people living in inf ormal set-
tlements. The government’s equalities impact 
assessment  acknowledged the 
disproportionate discriminatory impact  of the search  and trespass powers but 
argued that  such discrimin ation was indirect and j ustifiable. 
Impunity for Conflict-Related Abuses  
In April, the Overseas Operations Act  became law, creating a presumption 
against prosecution for some crime s committed by UK forces overseas. Following 
widespread criticism, the government removed the worst provisions  of the law, 
which would have effectively create d immunity for genocide, crimes against hu-
manity, and war crimes.  
In July, the government proposed a stat ute of limitations on prosecutions relat-
ing to over three decades of political vi olence in Northern Ireland. Family mem-
bers of people killed by security forces, and the region’s lawyers’ association , 
opposed the plan, seeing it as a de facto amnesty. In September, the Council of Europe’s h uman rights comm issioner 
criticized  the proposals. 
706WORLD REPORT 2022Grenfell Tower Fire and Right to Safe Housing  
An inquiry into the June 2017 Grenfell Tow er fire that killed 71 people continued, 
hearing evidence of a catalogue of failures, including to listen to the concerns of residents, many of 
migrant or ethnic minority background , whose warnings of 
fire risk were ignored. In February, the government announced a £3.5 billion ($4.85 billion) fund for low-interest loans to apartment owners in private high-
rise buildings needing to replace dangerous cladding similar to that in Grenfell. 
Fire safety 
legislation  passed in April began  translating some of the inquiry’s 
first recommendations into law.  
Terrorism and Counterterrorism  
In February, in a case relating to withdrawing  citizenship  from UK nationals who 
travel to join armed groups abroad, the Supreme Court ruled  that Shamima 
Begum  did not have the right to return to the UK from northeast Syria to partici-
pate in court proceedings to challenge the UK’s revocation of her citizenship after she joined the extremist armed grou p Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in 
Syria. The citiz enship revocation left Begum, who joined  ISIS when she was a 
child, effectively stateless. More th an 50 UK women and children previously 
linked to armed groups remain in camps in northeast Syria. 
Climate Policy and Impacts  
The United Kingdom is among the top 20  emitters of the greenhouse gases re-
sponsible for the climate cr isis tak ing a growing toll on hum an rights arou nd the 
globe. Prior to hosting the 2021 UN climate conference in October, it embraced 
ambitious emissions reduction targets—first thr ough its nation al climat e plan 
commitment to r educe emissions by 68 percent by 2030 c ompared to  1990 lev-
els, and in June 2021  through a legislated target  to reach a 78 percent reduction 
by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. Acco rding to the Climate Action Tracker, the 
UK’s 2030 target is aligned  with the country’s aim to re ach ne t-zero emissions by 
2050, and with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the UK is 
not on track  to fulfill these commit-
ments. Indeed, the UK continues to expand fossil fuel production  and channels 
707HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHbillions in domestic support  to fossil fuels  despite its commitment  to phase out 
fossil fuel subsidies. 
According to the UK’s climate advisory body , the UK’s climate adaptation efforts 
have not kept pace  with the country’s increasing c limate risk s, including ri sks of 
heat-related health impacts , and climate impacts on inf rastructure and food se-
curity.  
In November, a r egulation was adopted to restrict  imports of agricul tural com-
modities linked to illegal deforestation or the violations of laws pertaining to the ownership or use of land, as defined by the commodity’s country of origin laws. Many of the essential aspects of the legislation, including the enforcement mechanisms and the commodities that are covered, are to be defined by the sec-retary of state. The government should  have shown greater ambition by defining 
land rights along international human rights standards.  
Foreign Policy  
Since its depar ture from the European Union, the UK has proven its c ommitment 
to some key issues related to working closely with partners to call out and pres-sure certain states that fail to comply with their human rights obligations. How-ever, when weighed against other interes ts, the UK did not always prioritize 
human rights in its foreign policy agenda.  
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office continued to work to de-
velop an Open Societies Strategy. The strategy, part of the work of a new Open Societies and Human Rights Directorate, r epresents an important potential op-
portunity to mainstream and prioritize human rights in UK foreign policy. 
However, during 2021, the government significantly cut its 
foreign aid budget,  
which supports h uman rights and  civil society globally. There we re also signs 
that the UK would prioritize trade over human rights, including reinstating trade 
preferences  for Cambodia that had been withdrawn by the EU for human rights 
violations, while at the same time opposing  effective parliamentary oversight 
over any new trade deals.  
708WORLD REPORT 2022The UK refused to impose mandator y human rights due diligence on UK busi-
nesses and continued to license the export of billions of pounds of arms sales to countries such as 
Saudi Arabia  where they are used in the war in Yemen.  
The UK took more concrete steps in response to China’s ongoing human rights 
violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet. The UK imposed human rights sanc-
tions  on Chinese officials (to date only in relation to Xinjiang), supported a joint 
statement  at the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC), and made a fur-
ther statement  that called for a HRC resolution on China—the first time a state 
has publicly called for this.  
The UK took robust action in res ponse to the military coup and related human 
rights violations in Myanmar. It imposed sanctions  on number of key individuals 
and entities and suspended all support  involving the government directly or in-
directly other than for exceptional humanitarian reasons. However, as pen holder on Myanmar at the UN Security Council, the UK 
failed to push  for any 
meaningful action. The UK co-led  a Special Session of the HRC in February in re-
sponse to the coup, and whi le the text was weakened to  maintain c onsensus, it 
supported a relatively strong resolution  at the ensuing March HRC session. As 
president of the G7 , the UK led three strongly worded G7 statements on Myan-mar. 
The UK played a largely positive role at the HRC with some stark exceptions. The 
UK sponsored and successfully advocated  for the renewal and strengthening of a 
resolution to advance accountability in 
Sri Lanka , supported the creation of a 
special rapporteur on climate change  and Afghanistan , and joined statements 
denouncing widespread human rights violations by Egypt , Russia, and China.  
The UK also voted in favor of the resolution, which recognizes the right to a safe, 
clean, healthy and sustainable environment . However, it voted against a com-
mission of inquiry into the root causes of  recurrent tensions, instability, and pro-
traction of conflict in the Occupied Pales tinian Territories and Israel, despite 
unanimously supporting every HRC resolution creating a UN inquiry over the past decade (except those on Israel/Palestine).  
This was coupled w ith the publication in Apri l of a letter by the prime minister to 
an internal party group, which asserted that the UK strongly opposed the Inter-
national Criminal Court’s Palestine Investigation and suggested that the UK 
709HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHwould seek to interfere with the independence of the court to further this end. 
The UK also sought to weaken an Afric an Group resolution on systemic racism 
and police violence, expressing concern  at references to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights’ (UNHCHR) transformative agenda to combat structural racism, as we ll as to repar ations and the leg acies of co lonialism. Ulti-
mately the UK supported the resolution. 
The prime minister appointed a special envo y on the rights of lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual and transgender (LGBT) people, tasked with championing LGBT equality at home and abroad. 
710WORLD REPORT 2022United States 
The administration of United States President Joe Biden and the US Congress 
took positive steps on human rights by championing the rights of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people that had been 
weakened under the previous administration, committing to racial equity, and taking action to address the Covid-19 pandemic and its harmful economic im-pacts. 
However, the United States continues to fail to fulfill its human rights commit-
ments, most notably in the area of racial justice as reflected in the country’s fail-ure to end syst emic racism linked to the legacies of  slavery; a busive structures of 
incarceration, immigration enforcement, and social control affecting many racial and ethnic minorities; and the Black-white we alth gap that persists alongside an 
overall slight increase in economic inequality.  
Racial Justice 
Black, Latinx, and Native communities have been disproportionately burdened  
by the negative impacts of Co vid-19, which has deepened e xisting racial injus-
tices in healthcare , housing , employment , education , and wealth accumulation . 
While poverty fell overall due to stimu lus checks and unemployment aid , the 
Black-white  wealth gap, which is still as big as it was in 1968,  persisted.  
Across the country, state  and local  authorities launched reparations efforts seek-
ing to repair harms that are evident in cu rrent racial disparities and connected to 
the legacies of slavery. In April, the US House Judiciary Committee voted H.R. 40 , 
the Comm ission to Study and Develop Repar ation Proposals f or African Ameri-
cans Act, out of subcommittee  and on to consideration by the full house for the 
first time in the bill’s 32-year history.  
In May, Human Rights Watch testified  alongside sur vivors and descend ants of 
the 1921  Tulsa race massacre about the failure of city and state authorities in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma,  to provide comprehen sive repar ations ahead  of the race mas-
sacre’s centennial. Following the Centennial in June, the Tulsa City Council 
passed an apology resolution , but failed to address the city’s documented cul-
pability in the massacre  or provide full and effective reparations .  
711HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHHate crime incidents targeting people of Asian descent  and Black people  spiked 
significantly in 2021 compared to 2019 levels . 
Poverty and Inequality  
Economic inequality remains high and  has slightly increased  in the United 
States, with wealth disparities rising faster than inequality in income. The total 
combined wealth  of US billionaires increased from $2.9 trillion in March 2020 to 
$4.7 trillion in July 2021. According to US government sources, poverty dropped 
and hardship indicators improved since December 2020, aided primarily by gov-
ernment benefits. 
The American Rescue Plan, enacted  on March 11, which built on earlier direct 
payments by the administration of former President Donald Trump, included $1,400 payments for most  adults in the US  alongside other assistanc e to strug-
gling households. Food hards hip among adults with childr en also fell after the 
federal government began monthly payments under the 
expanded Child Tax 
Credit on July 15 , along with improved  food assistanc e. Federal  and stat e eviction 
moratoriums protected  millions of tenants during the pandemic.  
Still, Census Bureau data show  that in September 2021 some 19 million adults 
were living in household s with insufficient food, 11.9 million adults  were behind 
on rent, and some of the progress from late March had stalled as relief measures  
were reduced in legislative negotiations. The impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have been widespread, but remain particularly prevalent among 
Black adults, Latino adults, and other people of color .  
Criminal Legal System  
The US continues to report the world’s highest criminal incarceration  rates, with 
nearly 2 million people held in state and f ederal jails and prisons on any given 
day and millions more on parole and probation. Despite some reductions in in-
carceration rates for Black people,  they remain vastly overrepresented in jails 
and prisons. Following a trend starting in 2009, prison populations have de-
creased steadily , without sub stantially  dismantling the mass inc arceration sys-
tem.  
712WORLD REPORT 2022Prisons have often failed to provide sufficient  protections against Covid-19 infec-
tion. One-third of all people in US prisons have contracted the virus and over 2,700 have died from it. Many jurisdictions reduced incarceration in response to the pandemic, but detained populations began 
returning to their pre-pandemic 
numbers in 2021  even as Delta variant cases surged.  
Despite widespread calls for systemic reform during the summer of 2020, espe-
cially  to reduce overreliance on policing  and address societal problems  with in-
vestment in supportive services, few jurisdictions have enacted meaningful measures. Some localities have made efforts to 
deploy mental health care pro-
fessionals  instead of police in appropriate circumstances; some have funded 
non-law enforcement violence interrupters . However, police budgets overall 
have not shrunk . Congress has not p assed even the weak reforms  proposed in 
the federal Justice in Policing Act.  
Most US police departments refuse to r eport data on their use of force, necessi-
tating nongov ernmental data co llection and an alysis. As of Novem ber 3, police 
had killed over 900 people  in 2021, similar to numbers in years past. On a per 
capita basis, police kill Black people at  three times the rate they kill white peo-
ple. 
Children in the Criminal and Juvenile Justice Systems  
Despite declines in the number of youth incarcerated, racial and ethnic dispari-ties continue. The Sentencing Project reports that 
Black youth are more than four 
times , Latinx youth 1.3 times , and tribal youth more than three times  as likely to 
be incarcerated as white youth. 
Nearly two in three youth or dered into residential placement were placed in the 
most restrictive facilities . 
Slow progress is being made to end the sentenc e of life without parole for chil-
dren. According to the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, 30 states  have 
no one serving the sentence or have banned it for people under age 18.

RIGHTS   WATCH  Drug Policy  
Drug overdose deaths reached the highest number ever recorded  during the 
Covid-19 pandemic according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), over 93,000  people died in 2020 from a drug overdose 
death—a 30 percent increase  compared to 2019. 
These overdose deaths are part of an inc rease in mortality associated with un-
employment, alcohol poisoning, and suicide, circumstances related to economic 
insecurity and mental health challenges . A Rhode Island study  found increased 
overdose deaths among people experiencing job loss and  in subgroups with 
mental health diagnoses  in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to 
2019. 
US drug laws prioritizing criminalization  do not address the root causes of over-
doses and have had devastating impacts  in Black and brown communities. This

Rights of Non-Citizens  
Despite promises made during the p residential campaign, the Biden administra-
tion kept in place Trump-era policies deny ing access to asylum at US borders. At 
time of writing, the administration had carried out 753,038 expulsions  under 
Title 42 , an illegal policy to expel migrants arriving at land borders based on spe-
cious public health grounds.  
Title 42 expuls ions single out migrants arriving at land borders—who are dispro-
portionately Black, Indigenous, and Latino, pa rticularly from Central America, 
Africa, and Haiti—for discriminatory trea tment, while thousands of other travel-
ers are able to cross the border without  any health screening. Expulsions under 
Title 42 put migrants in harm’s way with thousands  suffering kidnapping, rape, 
assault, extortion, and other abuse aft er expulsion to Mexi co alone. In Septem-
ber, the government showed total disregard for the right to seek asylum when immigration agents on horseback u sed long reins as whips to control and deter a 
group of about 15,000 largely 
Black Haitian migrants  in Del Rio, Texas. 
715HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHThroughout 2021, the Biden administration sent  a series of expulsion flights to 
Haiti, exposing approximately  10,000 migrants  to conditions the US government 
currently recognizes  as being too dangerous for safe returns  of Haitians already 
present inside the US.  
In October, Human Rights Watch reported on  Department of Homeland Security 
documents cataloguing over 160 internal reports  of US border officials physically 
or otherwise abusing asylum seekers and subjecting them to due process viola-tions. 
Before a federal court blocked the Biden administration’s termination of the 
Trump-era Migration Protection Prot ocols, commonly known as “
Remain in Mex-
ico,” about 13,000 of the 70,000 people  returned to Mexico had been allowed to 
enter the United States to pursue their asylum claims. The administration’s diplomatic pres sure on Mexico, Guat emala, El  Salvador, and Hond uras to stop 
migrant flows resulted in serious abuses against migrants due to US policies, but far from US borders.  
After detention levels reached historic lows  due to releases prompted by the 
Covid-19 pandemic, the Biden administration dramatically increased the number of people detained for immigration reasons and also increased the number 
placed on elect ronic monitors, which facilitates in vasive su rveillance.  
According to 
data current  through August 2021, the United States decided over 
18,000 asylum cases in fiscal year 2021 (which ended on September 30), of which 63 percent were denied asylum, 36 percent were granted asylum, and 1 percent were granted a different legal  status. Despite the administration’s deci-
sion to raise the limit to 62,500, only 
11,445 refugees  were admitted to the US 
during fiscal year 2021.    
Health and Human Rights  
The US government failed to curb the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19 and by September 2021, the pandemic had become the 
deadliest infectious dis-
ease event  in the country’s history, tallying 676,000 deaths, 94 percent of which 
were of people over the age of 50 and including at least 3,600 healthcare work-
ers, most of whom were peop le of color. Struc tural racism impacted peop le’s ex-
periences of the pandemic, with Black and brown people more likely to suffer 
716WORLD REPORT 2022severe illness and die from Covid-19 , as well as face additional barriers to vac-
cines . In April, the Centers for Di sease Control and Prevention declared racism a 
serious threat to public health .  
Schools in some ar eas were clo sed for an entire school year, if  not longer, im-
pacting nearly 78 million students. Students of color  were particularly adversely 
impacted as they tend to attend less wel l-resourced schools and have more lim-
ited access to the internet for remote sc hooling. Meanwhile, unregulated  drug 
prices in the US have contributed to a crisis of  affordability  for essential medi-
cines. And despite positive cour t rulings, Indigenous commu nities in the United 
States continue to face significant barriers  to accessing adequate health serv-
ices.  
Voting Rights  
The country grappled with baseless ac cusations of  mass election fraud, ongoing 
suppression, and disenfranchisement of voters of color , and efforts to under-
mine election procedures  set up to ensure everyone eligib le can easily vote  in US 
elections. After comprehen sive v oting rights legisl ation failed to  pass the US 
Senate in June, a compromise bill, the Freedom to Vote Act , was intr oduced in 
September. Al so pending was the John Lewis V oting Rights Adv ancement Act , in-
tended to update and restore the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.  
Climate Change Policy and Impacts  
Historically, the United Sta tes is by far the co untry that has most contributed  to 
the climate cr isis that is tak ing a mounting to ll on human rights around  the globe 
and remains amongst the world’s top emitters.   
President Biden announced he would prioritize  addressing climate change, and 
rejoined  the Paris Agreement on his first day in office. However, the United 
States’ emissions reduction target in its national climate plan , is not sufficient to 
meet the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-indus-
trial levels, according to the Climate Action Tracker. If all countries’ 
commitments were in the same range, warming would reach just under 2°C, risk-ing 
catastrophic  human rights harms. Further, although the Biden administration 
717HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHhas taken s ignificant steps to reduce em issions, the United States is  not on track 
to reach it s target . 
Heatwaves, hurricanes, an d other extrem e weather event s lin ked to climat e dis-
proportionat ely impact m arginalized populations in  the United States. Authori-
ties h ave not adequately prot ected at -risk popul ations—in cluding pregnant 
people , people with disabilities, and o lder people—fr om such foreseeable im-
pacts . 
Women’s and Gir ls’ Health and Rights
Lack of ac cess to health insuran ce and c are contributed to higher rates of m ater-
nal and c ervical c ancer deaths th an in comparable countries, with Black women 
dying at higher rates. President Biden issued a presidential m emor andum on 
protecting women’s he alth on January 28 , rescindin g actions b y the Trump ad-
ministration that c reated difficulties for women to speak freely w ith doctors, ac-
cess health services, and get he alth information.  
On March 8, Biden issued an executive order establishing the White House Gen-
der Policy Council tasked with increas ing acce ss to compr ehensive health care, 
addressing health disparit ies, and promotin g sexual and reproducti ve he alth 
and rights, among other goals . On October 22 , 2021 , it issued a national st rategy 
on gender equity and equality .  
States continue to pass incr easin gly extrem e abortion restrictions. Harm ful laws 
in the majority  of US st ates forc e young people under 18 to involve a parent in 
their abortion dec ision, or go to court to receive a judicial bypass. These laws 
can delay or prevent  access to care. 
In September, a new law in Te xas effectively prohibited nearly all abor tions after 
six week s of pregn ancy, before most people know they are pregnant, with no ex-
ception for rape or incest . At time of writing, the law remained in place after the 
Supreme Court declined to block the law in response to an emergency applic a-
tion;  a second chal lenge w as p ending before the court.  
At time of writing, the Su preme Cour t was sc heduled to hear or al argu ments in 
Dobbs v. Jackson  Women’s He alth Organization , a case concerning a Mi ssissippi 
abortion restriction that c ould h ave s ignificant implic ations for abortion rights in

Disability Rights  
Police violence against Black and Latinx people with disabilities (especially peo-
ple with mental  health conditions, but not exclusively) c ontinued in 202 1, partly 
due to lack of community-based support services for mental health crises. Illi-nois 
and California  passed legislation to address the growing concern. 
Older People’s Rights  
As of September, approximately one-third of Covid-19 deaths  were in long-term 
residential facilities. There were also serious concerns about abuse and neglect  
in nursing homes during the pandemic. St affing shortages, a longstanding issue, 
and limits on fami ly visitor s, who often assisted staff, may have  contributed to 
neglect and decline. In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
undid a Trump administration rule  that restricted monetary fines  for certain nurs-
ing home violations. Congress considered bills to enhance nursing home ac-
countability , address elder abuse , expand home and community-based services , 
and improve direct care workers’ wages  and benefits.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
The Biden administration took swift steps to restore rights limited by the Trump 
administration, instructing federal agencies  to combat discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity.  
The administration also issued a memorandum  to advance the human rights of 
LGBTI people in US foreign policy, and reversed the discriminatory transgender 
military ban . 
Lawmakers in US states introduced more than 110 bills  targeting transgender 
people, particularly transgender childr en, threatening their health and rights. Al-
abama, Arkansa s, Florida, M ississ ippi, Montana, T ennessee, Texas, and West 
721HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHVirginia enacted laws prohibiting trans children from participating in sports con-
sistent with their gender identity. Arkansas and Tennessee enacted laws prevent-ing children and adolescents fr om obtaining gender-affirming healthcare. 
The Senate 
did not pass the Equality Act , which would expressly prohibit dis-
crimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity under various fed-eral civi l rights laws.  
National Security  
On January 6, armed rioters encouraged by then-President Trump broke into the 
US Capitol  in an attempt to disrupt the certification of vote counts for the presi-
dential election. Five people died  and more than 600 people  have been charged 
in the attack. The rioters inc luded white supremacists and anti-government mili-
tia members, and demonstrated that the extreme-right remains a major domes-tic security 
threat . 
The Biden administration announced it would review the legal and policy frame-
works governing lethal targeting of terrorism suspects abroad, but that review 
has not been made public. On August  29, two da ys after the Kabul airport sui-
cide bombing  claimed by the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISIS-K or ISKP) 
that killed at least 170 Afghans and 13 US servicemembers, the US launched a 
drone strike  on a car it cl aimed was filled with expl osives he aded to the airport. 
On September 17 , the Defense Department  admitted the st rike was a “ tragic mis-
take ,” killing 10 civilians including seven childr en. Following an investigation , 
the US concluded that there was no “criminal  negligence among military person-
nel” involved in the operation. The US announced it would provide “ ex gratia 
condolence payments ” to the victims’ families. 
President Biden pledged  to end detention at Guantanamo Bay but the US re-
leased only one detainee in 2021. Thirty-nine men  remain detained at time of 
writing: 10 were being prosecuted  by military commission and  two were serving 
sentences. While some pretri al hearings before Guantanamo’s flawed military 
commissions resu med in Sept ember after ext ensive  delays, no trials  are ex-
pected until 2022, including for the five  alleged September 11 plotters. 
722WORLD REPORT 2022Foreign Policy  
Upon taking office, the Biden admini stration announced  that it was c ommitted 
to a foreign policy “ that is centered on the defense of democracy and the protec-
tion of human rights ,” as well as to increasing multilateral cooperation. The 
United States was r eelected to the UN H uman Rights Council, and  rejoined the 
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris Climate Accord.  
In April 2021, President Biden lifted sanctions against senior International Crimi-
nal Court (ICC) officials but opposed ICC investigations that could include scrutiny of the conduct of US and Israeli nationals. The US hosted a Summit for Democracy intended to spur commitments by invited countries on human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-authoritarianism.  
The Biden administration 
revoked the Protecting Life in Global Health Policy , 
also known as the “Global Gag Rule,” which damaged sexual and reproductive 
health and rights globally. It also c ommitted to restoring consideration of repro-
ductive health and rights to its annual global human rights report. 
A US Special Envoy to Advance the H uman Rights of  LGBTQI+ Pe rsons was ap-
pointed, a vacant position since 2017. Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected 
the findings of the Stat e Department’s Commiss ion on Unalien able Rights —a 
Trump administration initiative advocating for a hierarchical approach to human rights—noting that human rights are “interdependent” and cannot be ranked. 
While the Biden administration adopted the Trump administration’s determina-
tion of 
genocide and crimes against humanity  by China’s government for its 
treatment of Uyghurs, it did not announce a legal determination on military abuses against the Rohingya in Myanmar or on abuses committed in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The United States urged the UN Security Council to discuss the hu-manitarian and rights crises in Myanmar and Tigray, but at time of writing had not called on the council to impose an arms embargo or individual UN sanctions on those responsible for abuses. 
The United States pursued sanctions on a range of human rights violations. In re-
sponse to China’s use of forced labor and other abuses of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the Biden administration issued an 
advisory  warning that US companies con-
ducting business in the region run a “high risk of violating US law.” The adminis-
723HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtration imposed sanctions  on Chinese and Hong Kong officials and companies 
over the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong. On Myanmar, the administra-tion imposed 
sanctions  on the junta following the February coup. The US took 
similar action against Belarus , Cuba,  and Nicaragua  in response to increas ingly 
authoritarian governance and rights violations. President Biden also issued an executive order allowing for US s anctions against individuals committing abuses 
in the Ethiopia conflict and terminated Ethiopia’s 
trade status  under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) due to human rights violations. 
The Biden administration did not impose sanctions on Saudi Crown Prince Mo-
hammed bin Salman following the release of  a US intelligence report that con-
cluded that he approved the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi .  
In July, President Biden launched a US strategy to address the root causes of mi-
gration in Central America, including promoting respect for human rights. The impact of this stra tegy has been limited. 
President Biden 
announced  a full US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan without 
ensuring that Afghans accepted under the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program and others at risk would be evacuated  and resettled. On August 15, the Taliban 
completed a rapid takeover of Afgh anistan and the US-backed government, cre-
ating chaotic and dangerous conditions for Afghans fearing Taliban retribution. 
The US 
evacuated  over 60,000 Afghans , many of whom had worked directly with 
the US government or US organizations, bu t thousands of human rights defend-
ers, journalists, and others left behind remained at risk. The legal status abroad of many other evacuated Afghans remained unclear. The US 
also evacuated 
thousands of Afghans who had worked for CIA-backed strike forces, including 
some accused of summary executions and other abuses. 
The Biden administr ation pursued arms sales and security assistanc e to coun-
tries with poor human rights records. Though the United States pledged to end offensive  weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to their role in the war 
in Yemen, it pursued arms deals with both governments. The Biden administra-tion authorized over $2.5 billion in arms sale s to the Philippines and requested 
$1.3 billion in secu rity assistanc e to Egypt despite deteriorating hum an rights in 
both countries. President Biden also skirted congressional legislation that re-
724WORLD REPORT 2022quires $300 million of US security  assist ance to Egypt to  be conditioned on 
human rights, withholding only $130 million  despite ongoing abuses. 
The United States funded an additional $735 million in arms sales  to Israel over 
the annual $3.8 billion commitment, even as Israeli forces used US-made weapons in May airstrikes in Gaza that violated the laws of war and apparently amount to war crimes. 
The Biden administration stated its willingness to return to compliance with the 
2015 Joint Comprehen sive Plan of Action if  Iran does the same. At time of writing, 
the US and Iran had agreed to resume 
multilateral talks  at the end of November. 
Broad US sanctions on Iran remain in place. 
725HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUzbekistan 
The pace of human rights reforms in Uzbekistan stalled and backtracked on 
some aspects in 2021, especially in the months leading up to presidential elec-tions in late October, whic h the incumbent p resident Sh avkat Mirziyoyev won. 
Uzbekistan’s political system remains deeply authoritarian.  
Freedom of speech and the media experienced cle ar setbacks, with authorities 
targeting outspoken and critical b loggers, including Otabek Sattoriy, who was 
sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison in May. Authorities continued to deny 
registration to independent human rights groups and to criminalize consensual same-sex relations. Authorities used anal ex ams, a form of torture, in prosecu-
tions of gay men. Impunity for ill-treatment and torture remained the norm. 
The government’s promised legislative reforms, including a new criminal code, 
stalled. A new law on religion fell far short of international standards. On June 7 , 
Uzbekistan ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
Presidential Elections  
Uzbekistan’s electorate re-elect ed President  Mirziyoyev w ith 80.1 percent  of the 
vote on October 24. No opposition candid ates, including Khidirnazar Allakulov, 
whose Truth and Prog ress Party was denied regis tration by the Jus tice Ministry, 
or Jahongir Otajanov, nominated by the unregistered Erk Democratic Party, were allowed to participat e. Authorities harassed Allakulov and others who supported 
him in the lead up to elections. In July, Otaj anov announced he was dropp ing out 
of politics completely.  
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Office for 
Democratic Instit utions and Hum an Rights (ODIHR) election monit oring m ission 
found “significant procedural irregularities” and that the election lacked genuine competition. Monitors also expressed concern about the overall restrictive legal framework for media. 
726WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Speech  
Although media activity  in Uzbekist an has increa sed consider ably s ince 2016, 
there was a notable decline in res pect for speec h and media fr eedoms in 2021. 
Journalists faced harass ment, prosecution, and  assault. Defamation and insult 
remain crimin al offenses, despite  President Mirziyoy ev’s decrimin alization 
pledge in 2020. In March, Uzbekistan adopted legislative changes criminalizing online criticism of the president. Radio Ozodlik, the Uzbekistan branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, remains blocke d. In June the Foreign Affairs Ministry 
denied accreditation to Agnieszka Pikulicka, a Tashkent-based foreign corre-
spondent. 
Authorities have targeted multiple bloggers with criminal or administrative 
charges. In May, a Surkhandaryo cou rt sentenced the outspoken blogger Otabek 
Sattoriy to six-and-a-half years in prison following a dubious conviction on slan-
der and extortion charges. Despite significant public outcry, his sentence was upheld on appeal  in July. A Tashkent -based b logger, Miraziz  Bazarov, was at-
tacked by a mob after he expressed support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans-gender (LGBT) rights, and had to be hospitalized.  
Members of Tashkent’s diplomatic community expressed concern about the at-
tack. Upon being discharged from hospital, authorities placed Bazarov under house arrest on politically motivated charges of slander. In August, the blogger Valijon Kalonov was placed under arrest on ch arges of insu lting the president 
online after he criticized the president and called for a boycott of presidential elections. 
Civil Society 
Uzbek authorities severely hinder the work of independent nongovernmental or-ganizations (NGOs) with exce ssive and burdensome registration requirements. 
The Justice Ministry continued to deny registration to independent groups. In 
April, the Humanitarian Lega l Centre in Bukha ra was denied regi stration for the 
ninth time. In September, after being denied registration for the eighth time, the 
founders of the rights group Human Rights House filed a lawsuit against the Jus-
tice Ministry. 
727HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHUzbek authorities continue to refuse to restore full legal status and rights to 
more than 50 people, including human rights  defenders, who, since 2016, had 
been released from prison after having serve d politically motivated sentences. In 
January, a Kashkardarya court ruled that Elyor Tursunov, who served nearly seven years of a 17-year sentence and who was ac quitted and relea sed in March 2018, 
should receive approximately US$8,650 in compensation from the government 
for his wrongful imprisonment. 
Criminal Justice, Torture  
A draft criminal code, published by the Prosecutor General’s office in February, 
retained many problematic articles, including overbroad and vague offences of extremism and incitement that would violate international human rights stan-dards, if adopted. Following its publication, review of the draft criminal code stalled. 
On May 25, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) is-
sued its opinion on the case of Kadyr Y usupov, a former diplomat who, in January 
2020, was sentenced to five-and-a-half years  in prison for tr eason. WGAD found 
that Yusupov was arbitrarily  deprived of his liberty and  said the Uz bek govern-
ment should “take urgent action to ensure [Yusupov’s] immediate release.” 
Yusupov alleged he had been tortured in detention. 
Torture and ill-treatment remain common in places of detention, with human 
rights groups and the media reporting on credible allegations of torture. Al-though Uzbek authorities said in 2019 that they had shuttered the notoriously 
abusive Jas lyk prison, the local hum an rights grou p Ezgulik reporte d in April that 
up to 100 people could still be imprisoned there.  
On June 26, P resident Mir ziyoyev s igned a decree on “improving [Uz bekist an’s] 
system for detecting and pr eventing cases of torture,” which includes a provi-
sion establishing prevention monitoring groups under the office of the ombuds-man tasked with carr ying out pri son vis its.  
728WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Religion  
Uzbekistan adopted a new law on religion in early July. Officials did not make 
public the bill before it was adopted. In a joint July 29 commu nication to Presi-
dent Mir ziyoyev, five UN special rapporteurs exp ressed seriou s concern about 
provisions in the la w, such as the prohibition of a ll forms of peac eful missionary 
activity and the banning of non-state- approved religious education and of the 
manufacture, import, and distribution of non-state-approved r eligious material.  
Muslims who practice their faith outside state controls continued to be targeted 
by authorities with spurious religious extremism-r elated criminal charges. In Jan-
uary, seven Muslims who in November 2020 were sentenced to between four and 11 years in prison on extremism related charges after meeting together to discuss Islam, began serving their prison sentences. In June, police brought ex-
tremism-related charge s against Fazilkhoja Arifkhojaev, an outspoken Muslim 
government critic, and he was sent  to pre-trial detention for three months. 
Freedom of Assembly  
Review of a draft law on public assemblies, published in August 2020, continued 
to stall in 2021. Amendments to Uzbekistan’s Informatization Law adopted in March prohibited bloggers and others calling online for participation in protests “in violation of the established order.” Spontaneous small-scale protests over social and economic issues occurr ed intermittently throughout 2021.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
Men in Uzbekistan who engage in consensual same-sex sexual conduct face ar-
bitrary detention, prosecution, and imprisonment under art. 120 of the criminal code, which carries a maximum sentence of  three years in prison. Gay men also 
face threats and extortion by both polic e and non-state actors. Uzbekistan’s 
draft criminal code, pending further review, retains the offense under article 154, with the wording unchanged.  
Uzbek police and courts have relied on the conclusions of forced anal examina-
tions conducted between 2017 and 2021 to  prosecute men f or consensual same-
729HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHsex relations. Such exams are a form of violence and torture, according to the 
World Health Organization (WHO). 
Women’s Rights  
Deep inequality between men and women persists in Uzbekistan. Domestic vio-
lence remains a serious problem. Neither domestic violence nor marital rape are explicitly criminalized, and the draft Criminal Code, published in February, did not include a standalone offence of dom estic violence. Between January and 
March, the Internal  Affairs Ministry r egistered 11,070 comp laints of harassment 
and violence against w omen. While the State Comm ission on Gender Equality re-
ported in 2019 that it had opened 197 rehabilitation and adaptation centers for women who experience violence, a June media r eport found that many such cen-
ters “did not exist” or “did not function” as intended. 
Forced Labor  
Uzbekistan continued to make significant efforts to reduce forced labor in its cot-
ton sector. Although the International Labou r Organization (ILO) concluded in 
January that there was no syst emic forced or child l abor in the 2020 cotton har-
vest, it noted that “about four percent [of pickers] were subject to direct or per-ceived forms of coercion,” that is, approximately 80 thousand people. The ILO 
reported that “there were only isolated  cases of minors below the legal working 
age picking cotton.” The lack  of independent trade unions  and civil society or-
ganizations in Uzbekistan undermines sustainability of progress made so far. 
Refugees  
After the Taliban seized control of neighboring Afghanistan, Uzbekistan con-
tributed to the evacuation effort by allowing planes to refuel and passengers to 
transit to safe, third countries, but cl osed its land border to Afghan refugees, 
and to date, continues to refuse to offer international protection to at-risk 
Afghans fleeing the country. Uzbekistan is not a signatory to the 1951 United Na-tions Refugee Convention. 
730WORLD REPORT 2022Key International Actors  
In January, Uzbekistan assumed a seat on the UN Human Rights Council (HRC). 
The Uzbek government signed a new mem bers’ pledge to pr omote international 
human rights standards during its term.  
The European Union in April granted Uzbe kistan Generalised Scheme of Prefer-
ences (GSP+) unilateral trade prefer ences, a schemed conditioned on the ratifi-
cation and implementation of core human rights treaties, despite acknowledging persistent concerns about Uz bekistan’s compliance. In June the 
EU’s Subcommittee on Justice and Home Affairs, Human Rights and related Is-sues “registered its concerns” relating to freedom of expression and assembly, registration of NGOs, and anti-discrimination, and called on Uzbekistan to inves-tigate attacks against bloggers or proteste rs. In October, the EU expressed “re-
gret” at the lack of genuine competition in Uzbekistan’s presidential elections. 
During a trip to the US in July, Foreign Mini ster Abdulaziz Kamilov met with Secre-
tary Antony Blinken, who called the US-Uzbek relationship “vital,” with the US offering “support for Uzbekistan’s  continuing reforms, including strengthening 
human rights and democracy.” In early October, the US Deputy Secretary of State visited Tashkent and met w ith the Uzbek pres ident and for eign minister where 
she “stressed the importance of continued  progress on democratic reforms and 
promoting respect for human rights.” 
731HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHVenezuela 
The Nico lás Maduro gov ernment and its  security forc es are responsib le for extra-
judicial executions and short-term forced disappearances and have jailed oppo-nents, prosecuted civilians in military courts, tortur ed detainee s, and cracked 
down on protesters. They used a stat e of emergency implemented in response to 
Covid-19 as a pretext to intensify their control over the population. The lack of ju-dicial independence contributed to impunity for these crimes. Judicial authori-ties have participated or been complicit in the abuses.  
A United Nations F act-Finding M ission (FFM) identified patt erns of vi olations and 
crimes that were part of a widespread and systematic course of conduct that it concluded amounted to crimes against humanity. In November 2021, Interna-
tional C riminal Court (ICC) pro secutor Karim Kh an announced h is decision to 
open an investigation into possible crime s against humanity committed in 
Venezuela. 
Venezuela is facing a severe humanitarian emergency, with millions unable to 
access basic healthcare and adequate nutrition. Limited access to safe water in 
homes and healthcare centers and a va ccination plan marred by opacity may 
have contributed to the spread of Covid-19. 
Starting in August 2021, government and opposition representatives held meet-
ings in Mexico to negotiate issues including electoral guarantees, the lifting of 
sanctions, respect for rule of law, hum anitarian aid, and political rights. The gov-
ernment withdrew from negotiations in October , following the extradition to the 
United States of Colombian businessman Alex Saab, a close government ally. The negotiations had not resumed at time of writing. 
Prior to the negotiations, the government had m ade limited concessions, largely 
due to increased international pressure, including naming new National Elec-toral Council members and allowing the World Food Program (WFP) to deploy.  
An independent EU elector al mission that monit ored the Nove mber r egional 
elections reported that political opponents remained arbitrarily disqualified from running for office, there had been unequal access to the media, and the lack of judicial independence and of respect for the rule of law had undermined the election’s impartiality and transparency.  
732WORLD REPORT 2022Persistent concerns include brutal po licing practices, abject prison conditions, 
impunity for hum an rights violations, and harass ment of hum an rights defenders 
and independent media. 
The exodus of Venezuelans fleeing rep ression and the humanitarian emergency 
represents the largest  migration cr isis in re cent Latin American history.  
Persecution of Political Oppone nts, Arrests, and Torture  
The government has jailed po litical opponents and disqualified  them from run-
ning for office. As of October 25, there were 254 political prisoners, the Penal 
Forum, a network of pro-bono defense la wyers, reported. While some detainees 
were released or transferred from intelligence installations to common prisons, a 
revolving door persists, with new critics being subject to arbitrary prosecutions. 
Security agents arbitrarily detained Freddy Guevara, of the Popular Will party, on 
July 12. Officials accused him of work ing with gangs that had engaged in a 
deadly standoff with police in Caracas, and charged him with terrorism, attack-
ing the constitutional order, conspiracy to commit a crime, and treason. He was held incommunicado at the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) headquarters until August 15 and released following the first round of negotia-tions in Mexico on the condition that he appear in court every 30 days.  
Intelligence and security forces have to rtured various detainees and their family 
members. In 20 20, the UN Office of the High Commiss ioner for H uman Rights 
(OHCHR) reported cases of alleged torture and ill-treatment including severe beatings with boards, suffocation with plas tic bags and chemicals, submersion 
in water, electric shocks to eyelids and genitals, exposure to cold temperatures, and handcuffing for extended periods.  
During several crackdowns since 2014, security forces and pro-government 
armed groups known as colectivos ha ve attacked demonstrations. Security 
forces have severely injured and occasionally killed demonstrators they had de-liberately shot at point-blank range with riot-control munitions, brutally beaten others who offered no resistance, and staged  violent raids on apartment build-
ings.  
733HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHOf the 15,756 people arbitrarily ar rested since 2014, 9 ,406 had been condition-
ally released as of July 2021, but remained subject to prosecution, and 872 had been prosecuted in military courts, according to the Penal Forum. 
In June 2021, OHCHR reported continuing torture, ill-treatment, enforced disap-
pearances, and arbitrary detentions. 
Alleged Extrajudicial Killings  
Between 2016 and 2019, police and other security forces killed more than 19,000 people, alleging “resistance to authority.” In June 2021, OHCHR reported that killings by security forces had slightly declined but continued. Many of these were consistent with previous patterns of extrajudicial executions, OHCHR 
said. 
Agents of FAES, a special police force, and others have killed and tortured with 
impunity in low-income communities, insti lling fear and maintaining social con-
trol. Previously, military and police raids in low-income communities, called “Op-
erations to Liberate the People” by authorities, resulted in widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, mistreatment of de-tainees, and forced evictions.  
Armed Groups  
Armed groups—including the National Liberation Army (ELN), Patriotic Forces of National Liberation (FPLN), and groups that emerged from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—operate mostly in border states. In Apure, they establish and brutally enforce curfews; prohibitions on rape, theft, and mur-der; and regulations governing everyday  activities. Impunity is the norm, and 
residents say security forces and local authorities often collude with armed groups. 
Starting in March 2021, Venezuelan security forces committed egregious abuses 
against Apure res idents during a w eeks-long operation ag ainst a FARC  dissident 
group known as the Martin Villa 10th Front. The operation led to the execution of at least four p easants, arbi trary arres ts, the prosecution of civili ans in military 
courts, and the torture of residents accused of collaborating with armed groups. 
734WORLD REPORT 2022Hundreds were forcibly displaced within Venezuela and at least 5,800 people 
fled to Colombia, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commis-sioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Most had returned to Venezuela by August, but confrontations continued.  
Environment and Human Rights 
Mining is the leading driver of deforestation in the Venezuelan Amazon, after agriculture. After President Maduro illegally declared the creation in 2016 of a special mining zone in the north of Bolívar state that covers 24 percent of the country’s Amazon r ainforest, the area  has lost more than 23 0,000 hecta res of 
forest cover, according to a study by the non-governmental organization SOS Orinoco. Anal ysis of sate llite imagery suggests mining operations cu rrently oc-
cupy at least 20 ,000 hectares of the spec ial zone. 
The special mining zone encompasses  14 Indigenous territories, whose resi-
dents were reportedly not consulted bef ore its creation. People in multiple river-
side Indigenous communities within and do wnstream from the mining zone are 
reportedly experiencing severe mercury poisoning, a toxic substance used to separate gold from impurities.  
Bolívar state is the epicenter of malari a in Venezuela, accounting for 55 percent 
of all cases, and there is a high prevalenc e of malaria among gold miners, whose 
high mobility represents an important vector of contagion. Pools of stagnant and polluted water resulting from mining activity  have also become malaria breeding 
grounds, OHCHR reported. 
Illegal gold mining in Bolívar state is la rgely controlled by criminal groups—“syn-
dicates”— and Colom bian armed grou ps which police c itizens, impose abusive 
working conditions, and viciously treat those accused of theft and other of-fenses, sometimes dismembering and killing them in front of others. The syndi-
cates operate with government acquie scence and sometimes involvement. In 
September, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the Venezuelan military and political elites, Colombian armed groups, and domestic gangs continued  to be key actors in the gold trade. 
735HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHJudicial Independence and Impunity for Abuses  
The judiciary stopped functioning as an independent branch of government 
when former President Hugo Chávez and supporters in the National Assembly took over the Supreme Court in 2004. Supreme Court justices have openly re-jected the sep aration of powe rs and consist ently upheld abusive policies and 
practices. 
There has been no meaningful j ustice in Venezuel a for the v ictims of extrajudi-
cial killings, arbitrary arrests, and torture committed by security forces with the knowledge or acquiescence of Venezuelan high-level authorities. Judicial author-ities have been complicit in the abuses, the UN Fact -Finding M ission r eported in 
September 2021, including by issuing retrospective arrest warrants for illegal ar-rests, routinely ordering pre-t rial detention, upholding detentions based on 
flimsy evidence, and failing to protect victims of torture. Judges allowed signifi-cant procedural delays and interfered with the right to choose one’s own lawyer. 
The Attorney General’s Office reported that between August 2017 and May 2021, 
716 officials were charged with crimes connected with human rights violations, 1,064 were indicted, 540 arrested and 15 3 convicted. The Fact-Finding M ission 
noted some discrepancies in the n umbers provided by Venezuelan authorities 
and found that ther e was no evidence that  authorities were carr ying out investi-
gations into responsibility for violations further up the chains of command. 
In June, Maduro announced a legal reform of the judicial system, creating a spe-
cial commission headed by his wife and National Assembly deputy Diosdado Ca-bello. The focus of  the reform so f ar has been on reducing ov ercrowding in 
pretrial detention center s, which held 38,736 people in June 2021, up from 
22,759 in May 2016. 
Right to Vote  
In December 2020, government supporters gained control of the National As-sembly in elections of widely disputed legitimacy. The government disbanded a National Constituent Assembly establis hed in 2017 to rewrite the constitution, 
which had effectively replaced the National Assembly. 
736WORLD REPORT 2022In 2020, the Supreme Court orchestrated the takeover of several opposition po-
litical parties, replacing their leadership with government supporters ahead of the December elections. In 2021, the new National Electoral Council announced that some opposition political parties would be able to participate in November 
2021 elections. The opposition confirmed its participation as the Unitary Plat-form. The European Union, a delegation of mem bers of the European Parliament, 
the Carter Center, and the United Nations monitored elections. 
Humanitarian Emergency and Covid-19  
The WFP estimates that one in three Venezuelans is food insecure and in need of assistanc e. In 20 19, 9.3 million Venez uelans suffered from food insecu rity, which 
was proj ected to increa se significantly. UNICEF r eported 5.8 percent of children 
screened between January and June 2021  with acute malnutrition, including 1.5 
percent with severe acute malnutrition. 
Venezuela’s collap sed health sy stem has led to the resurgenc e of vaccine-pre-
ventable and infectious diseases, and hu ndreds of people allegedly dying due to 
barriers to performing transplants. Shortage s of medications and supplies, inter-
ruptions of utilities at healthcare cent ers, and the emigration of healthcare work-
ers have led to a decline in operational capacity.  
OHCHR expressed concern over the absence of public data to monitor and ade-
quately inform pub lic health po licies. The gov ernment has not published epi-
demiological data since 2017. 
School attendance, already low due to the humanitari an emergency, has de-
clined further because of Covid-19 and related restrictions. UNICEF reported that 6.9 million st udents in Venezuel a missed alm ost all clas sroom instruction be-
tween March 2020 and F ebruary 2021. In-per son class es resumed in October 
2021, but with limited attendance. 
As of October 28, Venezuela had confirmed 403,318 cases of Covid-19 and 4,848 
deaths. Given limited availability of r eliable testing, lack of government trans-
parency, and persecution of medic al professionals and journalists who report on 
the pandemic, the actual numbers are proba bly much higher. Access to maternal 
health and sex ual and repr oductive  services, already dire, has fur ther deterio-
rated with the pandemic as the government failed to ensure access to services.  
737HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHMonitor Salud, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), reported 83 percent of 
hospitals have insufficient or no access to personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves, and 95 percent simi larly lack sufficient cleaning supplies, 
including soap and disinfectant. As of Oc tober 28, 779 doctors and nurses had 
reportedly died from Covid-19. 
Venezuela’s  Covid-19 vacc ination has been marred by corru ption allegations  and 
opacity regarding the acquisition and distribution of vaccines and other medical supplies. The government scheduled va ccinations using the “Fatherland ID,” a 
document provided to Venezuelans since 2017 to access public benefits, which has been used to exer cise social and po litical control, es pecially during elec-
tions. 
On October 27 , the government reported that 61.6 percent of Venezuelans had 
received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccines. Yet only 21.6 percent of Venezuelans were fully vaccinated as of that date, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and 25 to 28 percent of health professionals were still wait-
ing for their second vaccine shot in August. 
Refugee Crisis  
Some 5.9 million Venezuelans, approximately 20 percent of the country’s esti-mated total population, have fled their country since 2014, the Inter-Agency Co-ordination Platform for Re fugees and Migrants from Venezuela reports. 
While many neighboring governments welcomed Venezuelans, lack of a coordi-
nated regional strategy left many stranded in inadequate conditions or unable to receive refugee status or other legal protections. In some countries, Venezuelans are being deported or facing xenophobia and difficulties obtaining affordable health care, education, or legal status that would allow them to work. 
The economic impact of the pandemic and h ost government lockdowns led an 
estimated 151,000 Venezuelans to return home between March 2020 and March 2021, the United Nations System reported. Returnees were held in overcrowded, 
unsanitary quarantine center s, suffering thre ats, ha rass ment, and abuse by 
Venezuelan authorities and colectivos. 
738WORLD REPORT 2022Freedom of Expression  
The government has exp anded and abu sed its power to regulate media and 
close dissenting outlets  and carried out  campaigns of stigmatization, harass-
ment, and repression against the media. While a few newspapers, websites, and 
radio stations  criticiz e authorities, fear of  reprisals  has made self-censorship a 
serious problem. 
In May, authorities seized the headquarters of newspaper El Nacional , after the 
Supreme Court ordered it to pay more than US$13 million in damages for alleged 
defamation of Diosdado Cabello. The move  appears intended to silence one of 
the few remaining independent outlets in Venezuela. 
In 2017 , the Constituent Assembly passed  a vague Law Against Hatred, forbid-
ding political parties that “promote fas cism, hatred, and intolerance,” and es-
tablishing prison sentences of up to 20 years for publishing “messages of intolerance and hatred.” During the Covid-19 state of emergency, many people sharing or publishing information on social media questioning officials or poli-cies have been charged with incitement to hatred and other crimes. 
Human Rights Defenders  
In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that individuals or organizations receiving for-eign funding can be prosecuted for treason, and the National Assembly prohib-ited intern ational assistanc e to organizations  that “def end political  rights” or 
“monitor the performance of public bodies.” 
Starting in November 2020, Venezuelan authorities and security forces have con-
ducted a systematic campaign against h uman rights and humanitarian groups, 
freezing bank accounts, issuing arrest warrants, and raiding offices, as well as detaining members for questioning. They have adopted new measures to restrict international funding and require NGOs to provide sensitive information regard-ing their activities and contributions. 
In July, police detained  three members of FundaRedes aft er they repor ted harass-
ment by intelligence services and unidentified armed men to the prosecutor’s of-fice in Falcon state. The group had recently accused Venezuelan authorities of links to armed groups in Apure state. The act ivists we re charged with treason, 
739HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHterrorism, and incitement to hatred, based on publications on social media and 
the organization’s website. Two of them were released on October 26 on the con-dition that they appear in court every eight days; the organization’s director was still being held incommunicado at the SEBIN headquarters at time of writing. 
Prison Conditions  
Corruption, weak security, deteriorating inf rastructure, overcrowding, insufficient 
staffing, and improperly trained guards allow armed gangs effectively to control detainees. Exce ssive u se of pretri al detention contributes  to overcrowding.  
Lack of access to clean water and s ufficient, nutritious food, as well as low qual-
ity hygiene and medical services, have contributed to a high incidence of hunger and disease in prisons. The Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons (OVP) reported that 73 percent of detainee deaths due to health conditions in the first half of 2021 were from malnutrition or tuberculo sis, both of which are preventable. In-
adequate conditions may have also contributed to the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19. Based on official statements, the OVP reported 135 cases of Covid-19 in prisons and detention centers in 2020, and two deaths. Given insuf-
ficient testing, the real number s are likely much higher. 
Key International Actors  
During a visit to V enezuela in Nove mber 2021, ICC Pro secutor Karim Khan an-
nounced that his office would open an in vestigation into possible crimes against 
humanity committed in the country. The situation in the Venezuela had been under preliminary examination by the Office of the Prosecutor since February 2018. A June 2021 prosecution filing befor e the ICC, made public in August, re-
ported the office’s conclusion that Venezuelan authorities were unwilling to gen-uinely investigate and p rosecute relevant cases. 
In September, the Unit ed Nations F act-Finding M ission on Venezuela fo und that 
the justice system has played a significant role in the repress ion of opponents. 
Procedural irregularities and interfe rence in the judiciary, including by high-rank-
ing authorities such as Maduro and Diosdado Cabello, have ensured impunity 
for human rights violations. A previous repor t concluded there were reasonable 
740WORLD REPORT 2022grounds to believe that pro-government  groups and high-level authorities had 
committed violations amounting to crimes against humanity.  
OHCHR maintains an in-country presence, which increased to 12 officers in 2021. 
The office updated the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 on continuing abuses. In June, it found Venezuela had made limited progress towards the implementa-tion of its recommendations from prev ious reports. Both OHCHR and the UN spe-
cial rapporteur on unilateral coercive measu res highlighted  in Septem ber that 
unilateral sectorial sanctions have ex acerbated Venezuela’s pre-existing eco-
nomic and social crises, although OHCHR also pointed to other problems, in-cluding lack of official information and the need to investigate allegations of 
discrimination in food and health care access. 
In April, after more than a year of negotiations, the WFP announced an agree-
ment with the Maduro government, allowing it to supply food to young children. 
The agency started delivering aid in July and  planned to reach 185,000 children 
by the end of 2021. 
In March 2021, the US government granted  temporary protected status for 18 
months to Venez uelans alre ady in the US. The decision followed the Colombian 
government’s landmark announcement, in February, granting 10 years of legal status to the estimated 1.7 million Venezuelans there, and to those who enter 
Colombia legally during the next two years. 
Several governments and institutions ha ve imposed targeted sanctions on 
Venezuelan officials implicated in human rights abuses and corruption by can-celing their visas and freezing their funds abroad. Others imposed financial sanctions, including the US, which during the administration of then-President Donald Trump imposed a ban on dealing s in new stocks and bonds issued by 
the Venezuelan government and its state oil company. They remained in effect at 
time of writing. Despite a humanitarian exception, these sanctions could exacer-bate the humanitarian emergency which pred ates them, due to overcompliance. 
The administration of  US President Joe Biden has publicly criticiz ed human 
rights abuses by the Maduro government and expressed willingness to lift sanc-tions in exchange for concrete progress during the Mexico negotiations. 
741HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHIn addition to adopting targeted sanctions, the European Union has consi stently 
condemned abuses by the Venezuelan government, including at the UN Human Rights Council, and plays a leading role in the International Contact Group, which see ks a po litical solution to the V enezuelan cr isis and works to lay the 
groundwork for credible elections. Norway fa cilitated the Mexico talks, in which 
the Netherlands and Russia par ticipated as guarantors. 
An estimated 7 million people needed humanit arian assistanc e in 2020, the UN 
Humanitarian Response Plan for Venezuela noted. The plan, updated in 2021, calls for $708.1 mi llion to assist 4.5 million of  the most vulner able Venez uelans. 
As of October 28, more than $210 mi llion had been disbursed, and from January 
through July, 2.5 mil lion people had re ceived assis tance. Int ernational  organiza-
tions continued to face limitations importing humanitarian supplies, obtaining visas for personnel, acquiring movement permits, and accessing gasoline. This often led to delay or suspension of activities. 
As a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Venezuela votes regularly to pre-
vent scrutiny of human rights violations, including in Syria, Yemen, Belarus, Bu-rundi, Eritrea, and Iran.  
The Inter-American C ommiss ion on Human Rights c ontinues to monitor 
Venezuela, applying the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, after Venezuela withdrew from the American Convention on Human Rights in 2013. 
742WORLD REPORT 2022743HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH
Vietnam 
Vietnam system atically su ppresses basic civil and political rights. The govern-
ment, under the one-party rule of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), se-verely restricts freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, movement, and religion. 
Prohibitions continued in 2021 on the formation or operation of independent 
unions and any other organizations or groups  considered a threat to the Commu-
nist Party’s monopoly on power. Authorities blocked access to sensitive political websites and social media pages, and pressured social media and telecommuni-cations companies to remove or restrict c ontent critical of the government or the 
ruling party. 
Critics of the government or party face police intimidation, ha rass ment, re-
stricted movement, arbitrary arrest and detention, and imprisonment after unfair 
trials. Police hold political detainees f or months without access to legal counsel 
and subject them to  abusive  interrogations. Party-cont rolled cour ts sentence 
bloggers and  activis ts on bogus n ational sec urity ch arges. 
In January 2021, the CPV held its 13th congress, during which it selected the 
country’s new politburo. Of the 18 members, at least seven, including Vietnam’s new prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, have affiliation with the Ministry of Public Security. In May, Vietnam held a tightly controlled and scripted national election in which all candidates had to be approved by the CPV. Several dozen independ-ent candidates were intimidated and disqualified, and two were arrested. 
Vietnam boasted successes in 2020 and the first five months of 2021 in combat-
ing Covid-19. But as the Delta variant swept through the region, by early Novem-
ber there were more than 939,000 posit ive cases and more than 22,000 deaths. 
Law enforcement violated rights by using 
excessive force  to make people un-
dergo compulsory Covid-19 tests and  quarantine , and to enforce compliance 
with the lockdown.  
Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and other places put up blockades  and 
locked gates  to restrict movement during the lockdown without measures in 
place to ensure people could evacuate in case of emergency, access urgent med-
ical care, or procure food and other necessities. Authorities provided inadequate pandemic relief . Many people, especially migrant and freelance workers, relied 
heavily on help  from community networks, both for food  and medical  services . 
Hundreds of thousand people fled  Ho Chi Minh City for their hometowns as soon 
as the strict lockd own was eased. 
Freedom of Expression, Opinion, and Speech 
Diss idents and rights  activis ts face r outine ha rass ment, intimidation, arb itrary 
arrest and imprisonment. In 2021, the courts convicted at least 32 people for posting critical opinions about the government and sentenced them to many years in prison. Police arrested at leas t 26 other people on fabricated political 
charges. 
The government regularly uses penal code Article 117 , criminalizing the act of 
“making, storing, disseminating, or propag andizing information, materials and 
products that  aim to oppose the Stat e,” against civil society act ivists. In January, 
a Ho Chi Minh City court put prominent members of the Independent Journalists Association on trial. 
Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy, and Le Huu Minh Tuan  
were convicted and sentenced to between 11 and 15 years in prison.  
In May, a court in Hoa Binh prov ince sentenced l and rights activist Can Thi Theu  
and her son Trinh Ba Tu  each to eight years in prison. In July, a Hanoi court con-
victed writer Pham Chi Thanh  and sentenced him to five years and six months in 
prison. The authorities sent at least 12 other people to prison for violating Article 117 , including Dinh Thi Thu Thuy in Hau Giang (seven years); Vu Tien Chi in Lam Dong (10 years); Le Viet Hoa, Ngo Thi Ha Phuong and Nguyen Thi Cam Thuy in Khanh Hoa (five, seven, and nine years respectively); Tran Thi Tuyet Dieu in Phu Yen province (eight years); Dang Ho ang Minh in Hau Giang (seven years); Cao 
Van Dung in Quang Ngai (nine years); N.L.D. Khanh in Da Nang (four years); Nguyen Van Lam in Nghe An (nine years); Tran Quoc Khanh in Ninh Binh (six years and six months); and Nguyen Tri Gioan in Khanh Hoa (seven years). 
Police arrested rights defender Nguyen Thuy Hanh in April, blogger Le Van Dung 
(known as Le Dung Vova) in June, and former political prisoner Do Nam Trung in July, also for allegedly conducting prop aganda against the state. Others arrested 
and held under the same charge include Le Trong Hung, Nguyen Duy Huong, Nguyen Bao Tien, Tran Hoang Huan, Bui V an Thuan, Nguyen Duy Linh, Dinh Van 
744WORLD REPORT 2022Hai, and Le Van Quan. Prominent d issident  Pham Doan Trang  was held for more 
than a year w ithout acce ss to legal co unsel and  family visits. 
In 2021, the courts convicted and sentenced at least 11 people including Le Thi 
Binh, sister of former political prisoner Le Minh The, for “abusing the rights to freedom and democracy to infringe upon the int erests of the state” under Article 
331 of the penal code. Police also ar rested at least 12 other people on the same 
charge, including members of Bao Sach (Clean Newspaper), a group of inde-
pendent journalists fighting against corruption and rights abuses. In October, a court in Can Tho province sentenced mem bers of Bao Sach to between two and 
four- and-a hal f-years in prison. 
Freedom of Media, Access to Information 
The government prohibits independent or privately owned media outlets, and 
imposes strict cont rol over r adio and tele vision st ations, and print publications. 
Authorities block access to websites, frequently  shut down blog s, and require in-
ternet service providers to remove c ontent or social media accounts deemed po-
litically unacceptable. 
In July 2021, state media in Vietnam reported  that the Ministry of Information 
and Communications praised Facebook and Google for responding to requests from the Vietnamese government. They said that during the first six months of 2021, Facebook removed 702 posts and accounts, and Google removed 2,544 
videos and channels on YouTube that “disto rted leaders of the Party, the State, 
and the 13
th Party Congress.” The government also claimed Facebook responded 
affirmatively to 97 percent, and Google to 98 percent, of the government’s re-quests, and usually acted within 24 hours.  
Reuters reported that Facebook also 
removed  a number of pro-government 
groups and acco unts for “c oordinating attempts  to mass report content.” 
Facebook did not comment on the statement from the Vietnam government, but 
in a communication to Human Rights Watch in November 2021, acknowledged that “we do restrict some content in Vietnam to help ensure our services remain available for millions of people who r ely on them every day.” Google did not re-
spond to Human Rights Watch’s request for comment at time of writing. 
745HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHDuring the year, authorities also imposed monet ary fines on hundreds of people 
for spreading what  the government cl aimed was misinf ormation relating to 
Covid-19 and the government’s handling of the pandemic. Several people were 
arrested  for posting allegedly distorted, fabricated, or fake news. 
Freedom of Association, Assem bly, and Movement 
Government prohibitions remain in place on independent labor unions, human 
rights organizations, and political parties. People trying to establish unions or workers’ groups outside approved  government st ructures face  harass ment, in-
timidation, and retaliation from the authoritie s. Authorities require approval for 
public g atherings, and system atically refu se perm ission f or meetings, marches, 
or public gatherings they deem to be politically unacceptable. 
The Vietnamese government routinely viola tes the right to freedom of movement 
by subj ecting d issidents, environment al activis ts, human rights defenders, and 
others to arbitrary periods of house arrest, intimidation, and even kidnapping to 
stop them from attending protests, criminal  trials, meetings with diplomats, and 
other events. In January, a num ber of diss idents and act ivists including Hu ynh 
Ngoc Chenh, Nguyen Thuy Hanh, Dinh Duc Long, Truong Thi Ha, Tran Bang, Mac Van Trang, and Nguyen Thi Kim Chi reported that they were placed under house arrest during the Commu nist Party Cong ress. In August, during the visit of United 
States Vice President Kamala Harris to Hanoi, security agents also put Huynh Ngoc Chenh under house arrest. 
Authorities blocked critics from domestic and international travel, including by 
stopping them at airports and denying pass ports or other documents that allow 
them to leave or enter the country. 
Freedom of Religion 
The government restricts religious practic e through legislation, registration re-
quirements, and surveillance. Religious groups must get approval from, and reg-ister with, the government and operate under government-controlled management boards. While authorities allo w government-affiliated churches 
and pagodas to hold worship services, they  ban religious activities that they ar-
746WORLD REPORT 2022bitrarily deem to be contrary to the “national interest,” “public order,” or “na-
tional unity,” including many ordin ary types of religious functions. 
Police monitor, harass, and sometimes violently  crack down on religious groups 
operating outside government-controlled institutions. Unrecognized religious 
groups—including Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, Christian, and Buddhist groups—face con-
stant survei llance, harass ment, and intimidation. Followe rs of independent  reli-
gious groups are subject to public criticism, forced renunciation of faith, detention, interrogation, torture, and imprisonment. 
In August, a court in Gia Lai put Rah Lan Rah, Siu Chon, and Ro Mah Them on 
trial for being associated with an independent religious group disapproved by the government, sentencing them to between five and six years in prison. 
Rights of Women and Children  
Violence against children, including sexual  abuse, is pervasive in Vietnam, in-
cluding at home and in school s. Numerous media reports have described cases 
of guardians, teachers, or government car egivers engaging in sexual abuse, 
beating children, or hitting them with sticks. During the first six months of 2021, amid the pandemic lockdown, ther e were reports of 
increasing  physical and sex-
ual abuses of children in Vietnam.  
The pandemic was also linked, including in 2021, to rising incidence of violence  
against women, while organizations assis ting survivors of gender-based  vio-
lence struggled to adapt  and continue their services during the pandemic.  
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity  
In recent year s, the Vietnamese government has taken modest strides to recog-
nize the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, includ-ing by removing prohibitions on same- sex relationships and legal gender 
change. However, the gov ernment has not added explicit  protections for LGBT 
people. Vietnamese LGBT youth face widespread discrimination and violence at home and at school. Pe rvasive m yths about se xual orient ation and gender iden-
tity, including the false belief that same-se x attraction is a diagnosable and cur-
able mental health condition, is common among Vietnamese school officials and the population at large. 
747HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHKey International Actors 
Vietnam continues to balance its relationships with China, its largest trade part-
ner, and the United States, its second largest trade partner. 
Maritime disputes continue to complicate the relationship with China, which car-
ried out milit ary drills on the dispute d seas in 2021, while Vietnam raised re-
peated protests. Howeve r, during high-ra nking visits, the two communi st parties 
formally applauded their friendship and solidarity. 
The relationship between the United States and Vietnam stayed strong. Vietnam 
received Vice P resident Kamala Harr is in August . During her visit, Harris men-
tioned human rights  in p assing. Hanoi released  two Vietnamese-American pris-
oners convicted for being affiliated with political  groups outlawed by the 
Vietnamese government and deported them to the US before Harris’ arrival.  
Amid intensify ing repression in V ietnam, the Eu ropean Union C ommission has 
yet to provide any display of the stronger leverage  to address human rights 
abuses with Hanoi ostensibly provided by the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), which entered into force in August 2020.  
In January, the 
EU’s diplomatic branch  and the European Parliament  deplored 
the harsh sentencing of journalist Pham Chi Dung , who has been jailed since 
2019 for his outreach  to the European Parliament in the context of the EVFTA rati-
fication process, and of his colleagues Nguyen Tuong Thuy  and Le Huu Minh

748WORLD REPORT 2022Zimbabwe 
The administration of President Emmerson Mnangagwa failed to take meaningful 
steps to uphold human rights and ensur e justice for serious abuses primarily 
committed by security forces in 2021. There has been no accountability for 
abuses by security forces, including the August 2018 post-election violence, and killings and rape during the January 2019 protests. Abductions, torture, arbitrary 
arrests, and other abuses ag ainst opposition politic ians and activists ha ve not 
been meaningfully  investigated . The government  has yet to est ablish an inde-
pendent complaint system—as provided f or in Zimbabwe’s Constitution—to re-
ceive and investigate public compl aints against the security services. Other 
human rights concerns  include a severe water and  sanitation cr isis, including 
during the Covid-19 pandemic, forced evictions, and child marriages.  
The United States, United Kingdom, and Eu ropean Union all renew ed targeted 
sanctions against Zimbabwe for serious human rights abuses by security forces, corruption, and failure to ensure justice for past abuses. 
Restrictive legislation, section 73 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) 
Act, 2004, which punishes consensual same-sex conduct between men with up 
to one year in prison or a fine or both, contributes to stigma and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. 
Confronting Past Abuses  
During 2021, authorities did not take concrete steps to ensure justice and ac-countability for serious abuses, most of which were committed by the security 
forces. President Mnangagwa appointed  the Motlanthe C ommiss ion of Inquiry to 
investigate the August 2018 post-election vio lence, which found that six people 
had died and 35 others were injured because of actions by state security forces. Yet, three years late r, the authorities have not implemented  the comm ission’s  
recommendations, including to hold to account members of the security forces responsible for abuses and for compensating the families of those killed or who 
lost property.  
There was no attempt to inv estigate and p rosecute other serious violations that 
the state security forces have committed: including violent attacks, abductions, 
749HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHtorture, and other abuses against members of  the political oppo sition and  civil 
society act ivists. Hum an Rights Watch inves tigations foun d that secu rity forces 
used excessive  and lethal  force to crush nationw ide protests in January 2019. 
Local groups reported that security forces fired live ammunition that killed 17 people, and uniformed soldiers raped at least 17 women during and after these 
protests. No security personnel have  been arrested or prosecuted.  
Unresolved cases in whic h there has been no accountabi lity include the abduc-
tion and torture of rural teachers’ union president Obert Masaraure, comedian Samantha Kureya (kno wn as “Gony eti”), act ivist Tatend a Mombeyar ara, and  stu-
dents Tawanda Muchehiwa and Takudzwa Ngadziore.  
In May 2020, three Movement for Demo cratic Change (MDC) Alliance politicians, 
Cecilia Chimbiri, Netsai Marova, and member of parliament Joanna Mamombe, 
were abducted from police custody by suspect ed state agents for taking part in a 
protest in Harare. They were assaulted  and sexually abused by their abductors, 
then dumped in Bindura, 80 kilometers from Harare. While receiving treatment 
for their injuries, the trio were rearrested at the hospital and charged with mak-ing false reports about  their abduction. At time of writing their tria l was ongoing. 
Right to Water and Sanitation  
During 2021, hundreds of thousands of residents  of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, 
including nearby municipalities of Chitungwiza and Epworth, continued to face a potable water crisis thr ee years after a deadly  cholera outbr eak. The authorities 
in central and Harare city have failed to ensure clean water. Several factors have 
contributed to the city’s severe water problems, including economic decay; perennial droughts affecting Lake Chivero, which is dammed to supply Harare 
with water; the lack of maintenance of the old water infrastructure; the inability 
to procure the necessary chemicals to tr eat water sources; political struggles be-
tween the central government under the ruling party and the opposition-con-trolled city council; and corruption. 
The water cr isis has affected Harare residents’ rights to water and s anitation as 
well as other related rights, including the rights to life, food, and health. Many common water sources, namely shallow wells, taps, and boreholes—deep, nar-
row wells—are often contaminated. However, despite the known risk of contami-
750WORLD REPORT 2022nated water, there is no specific officia l information on which water sources are 
safe, leaving residents to take their chances.  
Zimbabwe’s long-standing sev ere water and sanit ation cr isis has been worsened 
by the Covid-19 pandemic which increased dem and for access to clean water for 
hygiene and the government’s imposition, since March 30, 2020, of a nation-wide lockdown th at continues to be in force at  the time of writing. The pro vision 
of safe water is an important measure to combat the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19.  
Forced Evictions  
On February 26, 2021, the local government, urban and rural development minis-ter, July Moyo, published a legal  notice ordering thousands of people to either 
acquire fresh rights of use or occupation or immediately vacate approximately 
12,940 hectares of Chilonga communal land in Chiredzi, southeastern Zim-babwe. The legal notice, Statutory Instr ument 50 of 2021, which the government 
later repealed and replaced, said  the land was being set aside f or lucerne grass 
production—farming g rass for stockfeed. Chilonga commu nity members went to 
court, which ordered the arbitrary ev ictions to be stopped until the government 
provides alternative land, compensation, and shelter.  
Other Indigenous communities also faced evictions to make way for mining and 
commercial farming projects in 2021. This included the Dinde community in Hwange as well as communities in Mutoko, Chipinge and Chivhu. Hundreds of Dinde villagers are fighting against threats of eviction from their ancestral land 
to pave way for a planned coal-mining project by a Chinese company. In Mutoko, hundreds of villagers have been living in fear of imminent eviction from their an-cestral land to make way for granite rock mining operations by another Chinese company. In Chivhu, hundreds of vill ager’s face eviction from their ancestral land 
to pave way for a 12,000-hectare iron and steel mining project by a third Chinese 
company. 
Children’s Rights   
During 2021, the authorities failed to fully enforce the ban on child marriages, 
exposing millions of underage girls to abuse. A landmark 2016 Constitutional 
751HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHCourt decision declared child marriages unconstitutional and set 18 as the mini-
mum marriage age for girls and boys, without exceptions. 
A 14-year- old girl who had been forced into marriage died during childbirth in 
July, at a Marange Apostolic church, in Manicaland province, highlighting the high price girls pay for the practice of chil d marriage, which remains rampant in 
Zimbabwe. The practice is prevalent among Indigenous apostolic churches, an 
evangelical group that mixes Christi an religious beliefs with traditional cultures 
and has mil lions of followe rs across the country.  
Key International Actors     
In February, the UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) placed 
four top Zimbabwe security offic ials—Owen Ncube, Anselem Sanyatwe, Godwin 
Matanga, and Isaac Moyo—on targeted  sanctions for being responsible for seri-
ous human rights violations. In July, the UK imposed sanctions on President Mnangagwa’s economic advisor, Kudakwashe Regimond Tagwirei, “for profiting from misappropriation of property when h is company, Sakunda Holdings, re-
deemed Government of Zimbabwe Treasury Bills at up to ten times their official value. H is actions accelerat ed the deflation of  Zimbabwe’s cu rrency, inc reasing 
the price of essentials, such as food, for Zimbabwean citizens.” Tagwirei was 
placed under US sanctions in 2020. 
The European Union on February 19 renewed its arms embargo and targeted 
asset freeze against Zimbabwe Defense Industries, a state-owned military com-
pany. The EU said the restrictive measures were in light of the continued need to investigate the role of security force actors in human rights abuses as well as 
concern about “a proliferation of arrests and  prosecutions of journalists, opposi-
tion actors and individuals expressing dis senting views.” It said that these 
measures would not affect the Zimbabwean economy, foreign direct investment, or trade, but “to encourage a demonstrable, genuine and long-term commitment by the Zimbabwean authorities to respect and uphold human rights and the rule of law.” 
In March, US President Joe Biden extended  for another year the targeted sanc-
tions against designated Zimbabwean government officials and other private in-dividuals. Biden told Congre ss that “Pres ident Emmerson Mnangagwa  has not 
made the necessary political and economic reforms that would warrant terminat-ing the existing targeted sanctions program.”
