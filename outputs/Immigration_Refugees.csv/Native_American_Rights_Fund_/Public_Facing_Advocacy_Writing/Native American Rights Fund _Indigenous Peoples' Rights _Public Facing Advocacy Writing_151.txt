Tam. The decision appears to clear the legal pathway for the Washington professional football team to continue to use a racial slur for Native Americans as its mascot. While the Supreme Court explicitly acknowledges that this type of demeaning speech is “hateful,” the Court found that “the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express ‘the thought that we hate.’”NARF will continue to work with its partners throughout Indian country to influence the Court of Public Opinion regarding the damaging effects on Native Americans arising from the continued use of a hateful demeaning racial slur as a mascot for commercial profit.NARF was co-counsel on an amicus curiae brief filed in the case on behalf of NCAI and three tribes.

Tam, please visit the website of the Tribal Supreme Court Project.More blog postsShareShare on FacebookTweetSend emailSign up for Latest NewsEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.ΔSupport Our workDonate Today!About UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual Reports & FinancialsNewsNARF NewsGet the LatestNARF Legal ReviewIndian Law News BulletinsOur WorkCases & ProjectsIssues & PrioritiesResources & PublicationsNational Indian Law LibrarySUPPORT USDonate OnlinePlanned GivingOnline StoreLog-In to Your AccountContact UsRequest HelpJoin Our TeamNative American Rights FundBoulder, CO (303) 447-8760Anchorage, AK (907) 276-0680Washington, DC (202) 785-4166Connect With UsFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinked InRSS feedDisclaimerPrivacy Policy© 2022 Native American Rights Fund
