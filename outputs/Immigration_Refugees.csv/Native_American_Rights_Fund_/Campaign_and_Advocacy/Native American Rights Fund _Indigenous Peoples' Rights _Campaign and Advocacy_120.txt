Marie Tribe of Chippewa; Shoalwater Bay Tribe; Skokomish Tribe; Spirit Lake Dakotah Nation; Spokane Tribe; Summit Lake Paiute Tribe; Tulalip Tribes; and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, in this action filed in the federal district court for the District of Columbia in December 2006 seeking full and accurate accountings of their trust funds. Such accountings never have been provided by the federal government, which is the trustee for the funds.In 2009, the tribes represented by NARF in this case were among the over 90 tribes who wrote President Obama regarding his campaign promise to resolve equitably all Indian trust fund mismanagement litigation against the federal government, by beginning settlement negotiations in this case and other tribal trust cases. In 2010 and 2011, NARF attorneys along with the attorneys for dozens of other tribes litigating trust accounting and mismanagement claims coordinated and attended many meetings hosted by the President’s appointees in Washington, D.C. in preparation for settlement negotiations. In December 2011, active claims settlement negotiations on a tribe-by-tribe basis began for many tribes. As of 2016, all of NARF’s client Tribes in this case have reached settlement agreements or other resolution of their claims with the United States. The settlement agreements have been filed in, and approved by,the court. Per the settlement agreements, once the Tribesreceived their settlement payments their claims were dismissed with prejudice.More CasesShareShare on FacebookTweetSend emailSign up for Latest NewsEmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.ΔSupport Our workDonate Today!About UsStaffBoard of DirectorsAnnual Reports & FinancialsNewsNARF NewsGet the LatestNARF Legal ReviewIndian Law News BulletinsOur WorkCases & ProjectsIssues & PrioritiesResources & PublicationsNational Indian Law LibrarySUPPORT USDonate OnlinePlanned GivingOnline StoreLog-In to Your AccountContact UsRequest HelpJoin Our TeamNative American Rights FundBoulder, CO (303) 447-8760Anchorage, AK (907) 276-0680Washington, DC (202) 785-4166Connect With UsFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutubeLinked InRSS feedDisclaimerPrivacy Policy© 2022 Native American Rights Fund
