Recent data demonstrates the consequences of us failing to invest in and properly support our students, particularly students living in poverty and students of color: in 2019, more than 65 percent of 4th and 8th grade students performed below proficiency in reading and math. Hostile school environments and exclusionary discipline policies also disproportionately target children of color, LGBTQ children, and children with disabilities, often denying them opportunities for success and pushing them into the school-to-prison pipeline. Children and youth experiencing homelessness, those in foster care, and those returning from juvenile detention are also often denied the tools and support they need to succeed and are therefore at greater risk of falling behind and dropping out of school.Less than half of children born into household and neighborhood poverty are ready for school at age 5More than 67% of public school 8th graders are not proficient in reading or mathA public school student is suspended every 2 minutesOur VisionWe envision a public education system where every child enjoys their education, feels supported and appreciated in school, and has opportunities to gain the social, economic, and cultural and political capital necessary to realize their full potential. All students have a right to the robust enforcement of our nation’s civil rights and education laws and freedom from discrimination.Education should be the great equalizer, leveling the playing field for all children. This means a public education system with equitable resources for all, including equitable access to high-quality teachers and programming within school districts and schools. It also means a public education system where children are not trapped in schools isolated by race and poverty and privy to discriminatory discipline policies and practices. There must be special recognition and attention given to the educational needs of children who are living in poverty or in families with low incomes, as well as children who are differently abled; English language learners; and children who are experiencing homelessness, living in foster care, or returning from juvenile detention.The SolutionWe work to eliminate discriminatory education policies and practices and the inequitable distribution of resources that undermine equal educational opportunities for all students. To ensure all children an equitable education, we must:Promote Equitable School Funding: We must eliminate the inequitable distribution of resources that undermine equal education opportunities for students, especially children living in poverty or in families with low incomes; children of color; children who are differently abled; English language learners; and children who are experiencing homelessness, those who are in foster care, and those returning from juvenile detention.Proactively desegregate our schools: We must eliminate the deep segregation along racial and economic lines that continues to exist in our public schools so that children of color and children living in poverty have the same access to high-quality educational resources and highly-qualified, experienced teachers as their white and wealthier peers.Work to Reduce the Achievement Gap: We must build support within schools so that all children have access to the highly-qualified and experienced teachers, diverse teacher pipelines, and high-quality educational resources and programming that we know they need to succeed.End the School-to-Prison Pipeline: We must eliminate discriminatory discipline practices in school districts and schools, create safe and inclusive school climates, and promote educational success for every child.Expand After-School and Summer Literacy Opportunities: Provide new resources to expand summer and after-school literacy and cultural enrichment programs for children to curb summer learning loss, close achievement gaps, and create additional opportunities for children to feel connected to their education.Jump to a Policy:SelectChild PovertyHealthEarly ChildhoodEducationChild WelfareYouth JusticeGun Violence PreventionThe ProblemOur VisionThe SolutionRecent BlogsCongress Must Invest in Safe, Healthy, Inclusive SchoolsJanuary 21st, 2022We know school policing and harsh, exclusionary school discipline practices harm students, so we joined 90 civil rights and education organizations to call on Congress to advance critical legislation to provide safe, healthy, and inclusive school climates.What the Build Back Better Compromise Means for Children and FamiliesNovember 2nd, 2021The compromise bill includes important generational investments to boost families’ economic stability and reduce racial inequities in income, housing, education, and health care that disproportionately harm Black, Latino, and Indigenous children. However, it leaves out important investments to ensure children and families have what they need to thrive.Don’t Put Youth Education in Handcuffs Too!October 28th, 2021Youth are still growing and learning at such a young age. They should not be subjected to such a harsh punishment because that affects them long-term. Placing them in juvenile detention centers does more damage especially when these centers are not equipped to truly help them on their educational journey.What’s NewLearn MoreTake ActionExplore Our Policy PrioritiesChild PovertyChild HealthEducationChild WelfareEarly Childhood DevelopmentYouth JusticeGun Violence PreventionYour support mattersA gift today helps children get the help they needDonate NowAbout UsPolicy PrioritiesCareersRequests for ProposalsInternshipsFinancial ReportsTransparency in Coverage RuleContact UsSupport UsDonate NowStoreCDF Freedom Schools® ShopResourcesReportsPress ReleasesJoin Our Email ListSPEAKER REQUEST FORMSStarsky WilsonState OfficesCaliforniaMinnesotaNew YorkOhioSouthern Regional OfficeTexasThe Children’s Defense Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
