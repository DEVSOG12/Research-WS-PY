As CDF’s new infographic (available in English and Spanish) and factsheet (available in English and Spanish) shows, citizenship means better opportunities for improved health and mental health outcomes, strengthened health care access, and much more to support children’s healthy development. Every child deserves a successful passage to adulthood with the help of caring families and communities, and citizenship is a critical step to making that journey safer and more certain.It’s long past time for Congress to heed the call of children and communities and deliver permanent protections via a pathway to citizenship.
