PRWORA was animated by racist notions that only some families deserve help and support, and the anti-immigrant provisions of the law were also fueled by the wrongly-held belief that immigrant families were drawn to the U.S. for the promise of free cash.The truth is immigrant children and families—like all children and families—deserve public benefits and income supports that promote their healthy development and well-being. Yet the law’s cruel restrictions had ripple effects, chilled access to benefits even when immigrant families were eligible, and arguably paved the path for the Trump administration’s exclusionary policies and anti-immigrant, fear-fueling rhetoric.Twenty-five years later, 1 in 4 children in the U.S. are children of immigrants. Their access to critical public benefits is inextricably linked to their parents’ immigration status and how their parents are treated in U.S. policy.It’s time to lift the bar on immigrant restrictions to public benefits. For children—and this nation—to thrive, lawmakers must commit to policies that promote all children’s well-being and center children of immigrants.Mina Dixon Davis2021-08-19T09:09:50-05:00August 19th, 2021|Your support mattersA gift today helps children get the help they needDonate NowAbout UsPolicy PrioritiesCareersRequests for ProposalsInternshipsFinancial ReportsTransparency in Coverage RuleContact UsSupport UsDonate NowStoreCDF Freedom Schools® ShopResourcesReportsPress ReleasesJoin Our Email ListSPEAKER REQUEST FORMSStarsky WilsonState OfficesCaliforniaMinnesotaNew YorkOhioSouthern Regional OfficeTexasThe Children’s Defense Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
