These young people came to America as children and are following their dreams.  They have grown into energized and productive students, employees, soldiers and tax payers.  Many stepped out and said we want to serve – but their service is now being cruelly disrespected and devalued.  Their dreams have become nightmares.The Children’s Defense Fund calls on Congress to immediately pass protections forthe dreamers who put their faith in our government but have been left in peril.  We must move forward, not backwards in protecting our future generations — their success and the success of our communities and our country depends on it.”Your support mattersA gift today helps children get the help they needDonate NowAbout UsPolicy PrioritiesCareersRequests for ProposalsInternshipsFinancial ReportsTransparency in Coverage RuleContact UsSupport UsDonate NowStoreCDF Freedom Schools® ShopResourcesReportsPress ReleasesJoin Our Email ListSPEAKER REQUEST FORMSStarsky WilsonState OfficesCaliforniaMinnesotaNew YorkOhioSouthern Regional OfficeTexasThe Children’s Defense Fund is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
