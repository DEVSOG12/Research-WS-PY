We started as a project to provide legal support for her family and help her mother pay for healthcare expenses.FoundedNovember 2018HomeFlushing, NYCShown right: Vigil for Yang Song, 2018Who We Are Now.We are a grassroots massage worker coalition in the U.S. There are over 9000 workplaces like these across the country with no political representation, or access to labor rights or collective organizing. Anti-trafficking NGO’s that claim to speak for migrants in sex trades promote increased policing and immigration control, which harms rather than helps migrant sex workers.We also organize transnationally with Asian sex workers across the diaspora in Toronto, Paris, and Hong Kong.Interested in supporting us?Consider donating or getting involved.DonateAbout Us Get InvolvedMedia Kit
