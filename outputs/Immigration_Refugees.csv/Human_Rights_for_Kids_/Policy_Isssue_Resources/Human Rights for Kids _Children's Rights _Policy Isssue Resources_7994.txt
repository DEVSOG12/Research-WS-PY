The new law also requires that a child consult with his or her parent or legal guardian prior to waiving their Constitutional rights and being subject to a custodial interrogation. HRFK published this Know-Your-Rights flier with our partners at Rise for Youth to help educate parents and kids in the DMV region about their new rights under Virginia law.
