The new law also allows judges to depart from any mandatory minimum sentence or suspend any sentence he or she would otherwise be required to impose. This bench card is designed to help judges navigate the new requirements of the law, as well as emerging constitutional jurisprudence on how children must be sentenced when facing criminal punishment in adult court.DownloadGo backTwitterFacebookYoutubeInstagramHuman Rights for Kids is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of human rights for children.
