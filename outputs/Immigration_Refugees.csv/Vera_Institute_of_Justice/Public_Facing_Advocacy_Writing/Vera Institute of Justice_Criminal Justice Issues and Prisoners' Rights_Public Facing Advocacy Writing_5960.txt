The report also gives examples of current, replicable practices, such as these:The Washington State Department of Corrections tracks statistics on renewable energy and fuel sources, water use, waste, toxic materials, sustainability, and employee awareness and compares them with baseline data from previous years, using sophisticated measurements that adjust energy consumption comparisons for extreme weather conditions, changing prison populations, and building age. The department publishes its findings in an annual Sustainability Progress Report.The Missouri Department of Corrections updated more than 20 career and technical education programs in institutions throughout the state with green curricula, equipment, and supplies. This work was completed through a $200,000 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant.These are just a few examples; the 75-page report is full of others. The main takeaway, however, is not just great models. The overarching point is that sustainability in corrections requires a holistic approach: buildings, operations, and programming should all reflect environmental literacy and stewardship. Having an environmentally friendly and energy-efficient facility is an excellent achievement. When an agency has such facilities and other green initiatives—such as teaching men and women skills that can help prepare them for jobs in a growing market when they return home—staff, incarcerated individuals, and the community can realize the benefits of a truly sustainable system.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
