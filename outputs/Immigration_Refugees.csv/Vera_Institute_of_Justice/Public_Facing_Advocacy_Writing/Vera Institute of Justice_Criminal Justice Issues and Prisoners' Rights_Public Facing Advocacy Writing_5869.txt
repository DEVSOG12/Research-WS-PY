We’ve been making lists.Our website, like the rest of the project, focuses on the use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in the criminal justice field. This month on cbkb.org, we’re posting 2012’s highlights from the blog, with links to the original entries. Our recent and upcoming wrap-up posts in December are as follows:• Special topics: Monthly themes about cost-benefit analysis and criminal justice that we focused on, such as public safety technology and what to look for in a CBA; • Webinars: Descriptions of this year’s CBKB webinars, produced in collaboration with five colleagues beyond Vera who helped develop and present the information; • Guest posts: Contributions from writers who have an interest in cost-benefit analysis and justice (on topics as different as the benefits of early childhood programs and a director’s account of  her reentry program’s CBA); and • Top Five CBKB blog posts: The most widely read entries published in 2012.We’ll publish the fourth post next week and welcome your ideas about whatever you read on the website. Feel free to comment on a blog post or send us a message via e-mail, Twitter, or Facebook.
