It is designed to elevate new and innovative research on policing practices and strategies, by providing readers with succinct summaries that highlight key findings and implementation recommendations. This digest equips the field with practical, actionable resources, and guidance on policing best practices by disseminating evidence-informed approaches.The second volume—released today—includes reviews of key scholarly articles published in the first quarter of 2018. It focuses on the timely topics of hot spots policing, officer wellbeing, effective supervision strategies, trends in calls for service, and technological advances, and answers questions such as: What is the appropriate dosage of hot spots policing? Can mindful meditation improve officers’ mental health and service delivery? And, how can supervisors proactively help officers minimize excessive use of force and arrests? Research was conducted by leading scholars and research organizations, including, but not limited to, David Weisburd, the Police Executive Research Forum, and the National Institute of Justice.In addition to making policing research more publicly accessible, the digest provides readers with information about current science to help examine emerging issues and how they might apply to one’s own police agency and community. We welcome input, questions, and suggestions—especially regarding research topics you’d like to see featured in future volumes—and look forward to your feedback and readership.Please forward any questions, suggestions, or subscription requests to EmergingIssuesPolicing@vera.org.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
