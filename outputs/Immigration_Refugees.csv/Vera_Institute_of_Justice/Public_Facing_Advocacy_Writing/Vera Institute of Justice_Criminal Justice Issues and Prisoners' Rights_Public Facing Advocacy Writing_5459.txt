This digest equips the field with practical, actionable resources, and provides guidance on policing best practices by disseminating evidence-informed approaches.The sixth volume—released today—focuses on the timely topics of de-escalation, pre-employment evaluations of potential officers, and post-traumatic stress disorder among law enforcement. It answers questions such as: What impact do perceptions of procedural injustice have on an individual’s decision to report crimes? How does an officer’s awareness of a citizen advisory council impact their perceptions of that council’s legitimacy? And, how do community members perceive body-worn camera programs? Research was conducted by leading scholars and research organizations, including but not limited to, the Urban Institute and the University of Alabama.In addition to making policing research more publicly accessible, the digest provides readers with information about current science to help examine emerging issues and how they might apply to one’s own police agency and community. We welcome input, questions, and suggestions—especially regarding research topics you’d like to see featured in future volumes—and look forward to your feedback and readership.Please forward any questions, suggestions, or subscription requests to EmergingIssuesPolicing@vera.org.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
