What we learned, in fact, has serious and timely boots-on-the-ground implications.So begins an op-ed by Vera President Nick Turner and Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Secretary John Wetzel in National Journal’s The Next America. Read about what those implications are, how Pennsylvania has taken action, and some strategies for reducing reoffending and creating stronger people and stronger and safer communities.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
