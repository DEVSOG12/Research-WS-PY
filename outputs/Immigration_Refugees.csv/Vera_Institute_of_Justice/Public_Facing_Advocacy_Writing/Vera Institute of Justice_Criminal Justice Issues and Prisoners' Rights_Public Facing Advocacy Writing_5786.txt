One is a technical audience, including legislative, policy, budget and fiscal analysts, researchers, evaluators, criminologists, and others in similar or related professions. For these readers, the forest is important, but the trees are more their thing. The other audience is interested in the big picture and the policy ramifications at hand, with readers who would usually prefer to leave the minutiae—or at least the calculations!—to someone else. This group includes elected officials and their staff; policymakers; corrections, community corrections, court, and law enforcement personnel; service providers; and journalists.These two audiences are typically looking for different types of information regarding cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of justice programs and policies. When Vera convened a working group of respected policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to discuss cost-benefit methods, members of the group easily reached consensus about the need for two distinct resources: one for CBA practitioners to specifically address methodological issues, and another for a broader policy audience.With input and guidance from the cost-benefit methods working group, CBKB recently published two white papers:The first, Advancing the Quality of Cost-Benefit Analysis for Justice Programs, was written for a technical audience. You’ll find it at www.vera.org/cbamethods.The second, Using Cost-Benefit Analysis for Justice Policymaking, helps readers know what to look for in a justice-related CBA, understand what cost-benefit results mean, and use those results to make better-informed decisions. The paper is online at http://www.vera.org/cbapolicy.We are grateful to the methods working-group members, who contributed their time and ideas generously and diligently:Mike Clark, chief economist, Kentucky Legislative Research CommissionMeredith Farrar-Owens, director, Virginia Criminal Sentencing CommissionLynn A.
