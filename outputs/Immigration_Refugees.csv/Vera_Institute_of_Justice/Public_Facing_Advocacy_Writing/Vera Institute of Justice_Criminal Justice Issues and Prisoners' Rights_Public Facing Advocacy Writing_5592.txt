that he knew that even when his office won a sentence of incarceration, there was always also a loss in that—to the incarcerated person, his or her family, and the community; that he understood that the criminal justice system did not treat people of color equally, now or over the course of our history; and that he did not believe we could punish our way out of pain.We are at a crossroads for prosecution in America. Prosecutors can continue to regard their primary responsibility as securing convictions and lengthy prison terms, and can play the role they have for the past three decades in making America the largest incarcerator in human history. Or they can do something else—they can see their primary responsibility as securing justice, knowing that will not always mean convictions or lengthy prison terms—that their charge will require decision-making and leadership that is more complex, more pragmatic, more informed, and more humane.  When they choose the latter, they will, even from their seats as law enforcement, become partners in securing safety and ending mass incarceration, knowing the two are not only unopposed, they are, we increasingly understand, interdependent. They will also be acting with respect for the full range of crime survivors, many of whom find incarceration to be counterproductive to their own safety. While securing convictions is part of a prosecutor’s job description—and Ken Thompson served that role (including some controversial choices)—at the end of the day, he didn’t just answer to conviction rates, he answered as best he could to justice.  He was a new kind of prosecutor, and there are few things we need more in our criminal justice system than exactly that.While securing convictions is part of a prosecutor’s job description...he didn’t just answer to conviction rates, he answered as best he could to justice.As we start to imagine moving forward in a Brooklyn and world without Ken Thompson in it, I think of the young people who were offered the chance to participate in Common Justice on his watch, and who may live long, free lives now, and of the crime survivors who had the opportunity to have their needs truly met because of his clarity of purpose in his partnership with us. I think of all the young people who walked down the street and were not stopped for simple marijuana possession because of his office’s refusal to keep prosecuting these low-level crimes that were so inequitably enforced—people who could not have felt the impact of his role directly but nonetheless were freer because of it. I think of the people who were exonerated when, under his leadership, his office took responsibility for reversing the wrongful convictions that had taken decades of their lives. I think of all of us who looked to him as a beacon for what prosecution in America could become at a time when we cannot afford to spare any sources of hope. And of course, above all, I think of his family, whose loss far surpasses our own, massive though it is.I don’t think we yet know the full measure of what we lost when Ken Thompson passed on Sunday night. I do know he wanted to pave the way to a different kind of prosecution in America. We can begin to honor his legacy by settling for nothing less.RelatedPUBLICATIONYoung Men of Color and the Other Side of HarmDec 16, 2014NEWSBlack Wounds MatterOct 15, 2015VIDEOThe Case for Diversion / Race and Justice in AmericaNov 12, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
