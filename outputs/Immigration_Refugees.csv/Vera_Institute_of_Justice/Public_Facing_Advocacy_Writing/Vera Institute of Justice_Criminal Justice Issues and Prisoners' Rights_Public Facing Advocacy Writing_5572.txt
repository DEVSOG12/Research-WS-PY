They also present different needs than men once there. The situation is particularly concerning for women of color, immigrants, LGBTQ women, and people who are trans or gender non-conforming, who must deal with additional implicit and explicit biases.In addition, the justice system affects more women than those who pass through it directly, such as those who become the sole breadwinner or single parent of their household after other family members are incarcerated, or those who must also cover the cost of criminal-justice related fines, fees, and other costs—such as medical care or substance abuse treatment—incurred by their justice system-involved loved ones.These women, both incarcerated and in the community, are an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to addressing mass incarceration and reimagining prisons and jails.
