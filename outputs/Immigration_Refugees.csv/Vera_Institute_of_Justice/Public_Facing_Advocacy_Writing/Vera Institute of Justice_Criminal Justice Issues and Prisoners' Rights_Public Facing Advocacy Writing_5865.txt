Instead, in a detailed settlement agreement, the DOJ spelled out the many changes in policy and practice that the county must now fulfill.Two weeks earlier, Annie Salsich, director of Vera’s Center on Youth Justice, wrote in this space about the positive significance of the U.S. Department of Justice’s push toward full-scale juvenile justice system reform in Memphis and surrounding Shelby County, where a lengthy investigation by the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section found evidence of widespread violations of the rights of the young people.As Annie Salsich said—and the Times editorial concurred—the DOJ’s holistic view of juvenile justice reform in this case is a model for improving youth justice around the country.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
