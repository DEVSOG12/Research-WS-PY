The problem is that most trafficking victims are not discovered, and the traffickers are never stopped. Sanctuary for Families and several other victim serving organizations have collaborated with Vera in designing and implementing a human trafficking victim identification screening tool, which is currently being tested in the field. Vera researchers greatly value the frontline expertise of our partners, because it helps ensure that our research is grounded, meaningful and useful.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
