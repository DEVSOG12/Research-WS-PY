But most public housing authorities (PHAs) have admissions policies that prevent formerly incarcerated people from living there. For nearly all types of convictions, housing authorities exercise their individual discretion to set eligibility criteria. Federal policymakers have encouraged PHAs to rethink limits on public housing for people with criminal conviction histories and to actively address barriers to housing that can reinforce discrimination. The Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) developed the eight recommendations in this fact sheet to do just that. The recommendations are informed by Vera’s work with PHAs, law enforcement agencies, county and state corrections departments, reentry service providers, homelessness service providers, continuum of care organizations, resident advocates, and other community stakeholders through its Opening Doors initiative.AuthorsJacqueline Altamirano MarinErica CrewMargaret diZeregaKey TakeawayThe eight recommendations in this fact sheet can help public housing authorities (PHAs) actively address discriminatory barriers to housing for people with criminal convictions histories.Publication HighlightsMost public housing authorities have admissions policies that prevent formerly incarcerated people from living there.For nearly all types of convictions, housing authorities exercise their individual discretion to set eligibility criteria.PHAs could align their eligibility criteria with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recommendations by discontinuing the use of “one-strike” policies, which deny admission to anyone with a criminal record.Key FactsReoffending generally occurs soon after release: of the people who were rearrested within nine years of their release,82%were arrested again within the first three years.The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developmentno longer recommends “one-strike” policies, which deny housing eligibility to anyone with a criminal record.Evictions are often a result of poverty and strained resources: only1 in 4families in the United States who qualify for housing assistance get it.RelatedNEWSIllinois Bill Makes History, Highlights Criminalization-to-Homelessness PipelineFeb 23, 2021NEWSFinding housing is hard—but for people leaving prison and jail, it’s almost impossibleAug 30, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
