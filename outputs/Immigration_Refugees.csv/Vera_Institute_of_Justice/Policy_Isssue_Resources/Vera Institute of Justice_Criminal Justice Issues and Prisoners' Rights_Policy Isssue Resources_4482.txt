This funding structure is the product of state law, state and local budgetary decisions, and long-standing local practice.Using data from 2015, Vera analyzed this funding model in order to determine how much revenue the city of New Orleans collected from those in contact with the criminal justice system in comparison to the operating costs spent on individuals who were incarcerated because they could not pay. This report details the results of Vera’s analysis and offers an alternative vision for justice.Key TakeawayThe city’s approach to funding its criminal justice system is generally meant to shift the system’s costs from all taxpayers to those who have contact with the system. However, Vera’s analysis found that the current funding model is both unjust and expensive—costing taxpayers more money in the long run.Publication HighlightsThere is no evidence that detaining people pretrial because they cannot pay increases public safety. Indeed, pretrial incarceration itself correlates with an increased likelihood of future rearrest, even after only a few days in jail.If the city and criminal justice system agencies collaborate, it is possible—without state law change—to refocus on justice and public safety by eliminating the two major forms of wealth extraction and replacing those revenue sources with direct funding.Key FactsNew Orleans spends$6.4Ma year incarcerating people who cannot pay financial bail and fees. But criminal justice agencies only collect $4.5M a year from those same costs, meaning the city is losing money.On any given day,30%of the people locked in the New Orleans jail are there solely because they cannot afford to pay the 12% required to purchase a bail bond, let alone the full amount of financial bail.Black New Orleanians were jailed at1.5Xthe rate of white New Orleanians for failure to pay conviction fines and fees in 2015.Louisiana’s pretrial detention rate among people ages 15 to 64 is the highest in the nation and more than2Xthe national average.RelatedPUBLICATIONPast DueJan 09, 2017VIDEOPast DueJan 09, 2017VIDEOBail, Fines, and FeesJul 25, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
