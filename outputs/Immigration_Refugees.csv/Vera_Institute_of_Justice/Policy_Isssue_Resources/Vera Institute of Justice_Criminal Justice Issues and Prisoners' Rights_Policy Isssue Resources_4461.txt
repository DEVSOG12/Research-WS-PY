This report fills a gap until the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) releases its 2018 annual report—likely in early 2020—which will include additional data, such as population breakdowns by race and sex. Specifically, Vera studied both prison populations and incarceration rates at the state and federal levels and demonstrated both the overall U.S. incarceration trend as well as trends within individual regions and states.AuthorsJacob Kang-BrownEital Schattner-ElmalehOliver HindsPrison Population Change 2017-2018Adjust arrows to view the four different combinations of population trends and incarceration rate.

However, the declines were not universal.
