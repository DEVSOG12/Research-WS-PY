Vera was engaged by the Hudson-Webber Foundation to conduct a study of Wayne County’s jail population in partnership with a working group of local justice-system stakeholders. The study involved analyzing quantitative data from the jail as well as gathering information and perspectives from the working group, community advocates, and people directly impacted by jail incarceration to identify what drives the jail population in Wayne County. The analysis included the most common charges people in jail face, and how long people stay in the jail and why.
