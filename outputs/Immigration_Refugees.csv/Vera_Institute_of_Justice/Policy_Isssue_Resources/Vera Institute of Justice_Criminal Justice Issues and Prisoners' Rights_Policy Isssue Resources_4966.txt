The department's decision to expand the program to other precincts was made long before this study was completed; nevertheless, the experience and insights gained in studying the pilot enabled Vera research staff to design research asking the following questions among others: Can regular police implement all four dimensions of the CPO role? How do they react to the role in terms of their job satisfaction and their image of themselves as police officers? How do CPOs attempt to establish relationships with the community and involve community representatives? How well do the officers implement the problem-solving process? What kind of neighborhood problems were identified using the process? What is the nature of community reaction to the program?34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
