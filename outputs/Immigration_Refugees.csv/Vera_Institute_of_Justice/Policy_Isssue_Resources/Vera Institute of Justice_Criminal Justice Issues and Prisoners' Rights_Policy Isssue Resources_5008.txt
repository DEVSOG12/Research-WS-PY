The CCRB is controversial due to its structure being revised to be composed of police department personnel only, rather than its initial setup as a joint civilian-police board. This results in low credibility among segments of the civilian population, exacerbated by reports of police brutality against minorities in New York City. Vera was commissioned by the NYPD to determine whether the CCRB was fair, consistent and objective in the processing of civilian complaints. It concludes that the CCRB is generally a fair and legitimate body but that its image and credibility must be restored, both with police and with the wider community.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
