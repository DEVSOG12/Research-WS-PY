For this phase of the initiative, Vera—with funding from the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA)—has selected four sites that will receive up to 12 months of technical assistance to plan and implement reentry programs and/or change their admissions policies regarding people with conviction histories.AuthorsBrian WalshRelatedNEWSExpanding Housing Access for Formerly Incarcerated PeopleFeb 20, 2018PUBLICATIONOpening DoorsSep 29, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
