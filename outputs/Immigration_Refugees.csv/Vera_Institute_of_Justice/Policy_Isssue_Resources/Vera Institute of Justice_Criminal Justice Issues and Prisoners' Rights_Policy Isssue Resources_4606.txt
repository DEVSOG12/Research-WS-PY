In this series from Vera’s Current Thinking blog, you’ll hear from service providers who have experience working with survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, young men of color harmed by street violence, LGBTQ survivors, survivors with disabilities, survivors engaged in sex work, survivors of human trafficking, and others. Together, these writers explore the limitations imposed by our existing framework of “innocence” and point to ways forward that better uphold the values of equity, public safety, and human dignity.AuthorsKate D'AdamoAmy JudyKenton KirbyCatherine Shugrue dos SantosChanel LopezChanel is a hate violence counselor and advocate for the Anti-Violence Project.Shameeka MattisFormer Director of ReplicationRommell WashingtonMSW, Mt.
