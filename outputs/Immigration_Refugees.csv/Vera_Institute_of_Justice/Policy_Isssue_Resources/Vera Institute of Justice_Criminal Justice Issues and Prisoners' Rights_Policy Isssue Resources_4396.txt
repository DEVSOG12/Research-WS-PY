Of these, researchers estimate that more than 90 percent are the result of plea bargaining—an informal and unregulated process by which prosecutors and defense counsel negotiate charging and sentencing concessions in exchange for guilty pleas and waivers of constitutionally guaranteed trial rights. But there are concerns about plea bargaining’s coercive nature, its role in encouraging the forfeiture of procedural protections, and its role in fueling mass incarceration. In order to provide an accessible summary of existing research, the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) examined the small but growing body of empirical studies that has developed around plea bargaining. The result is a mix of complicated, nuanced, and sometimes contradictory research findings.AuthorsRam SubramanianLéon DigardMelvin Washington IIStephanie SorageKey TakeawayFixing the major failings of America’s justice system—including mass incarceration and systemic racism—is made more difficult when the most common and fundamental of court operations is largely invisible. It is incumbent on court actors, legislators, advocates, researchers, and the community to demand a system that embraces greater transparency.Publication HighlightsThere is a strong association between pretrial detention and guilty pleas, as people who can’t afford bail agree to plea deals to secure their release from jail.When prosecutors have the option to pursue the death penalty, people are more likely to plead guilty.On average, Black men receive the least lenient plea deals, and white women the most lenient.Key FactsMore than90%of criminal cases that end in conviction are the result of plea bargaining.Pretrial detention increases a person’s likelihood of pleading guilty by46%People are25 percentage pointsmore likely to plead guilty when faced with the death penalty.The odds of receiving a plea offer that includes incarceration are almost70% greaterfor Black people than white people.Custodial sentences imposed at trial are64% longeron average, than sentences imposed through pleas.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
