Yet, police also must answer directly to an internal command structure and to governing officials. These multiple sources of accountability sometimes create differing expectations. Computerized crime mapping, when thoughtfully implemented, can help police balance these interests. It is a versatile tool that can simultaneously enhance police accountability to the public, foster organizational efficiency and promote public safety. Covering a range of technical and policy issues, this paper discusses the benefits and challenges associated with crime mapping in democratic societies.AuthorsJohn Markovic34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
