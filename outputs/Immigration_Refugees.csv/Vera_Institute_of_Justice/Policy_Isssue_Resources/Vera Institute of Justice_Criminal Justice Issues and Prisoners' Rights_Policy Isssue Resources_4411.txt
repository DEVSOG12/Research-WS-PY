People in detention face high risks of infection from the close quarters of facilities, shelters, and courtrooms, and they lack adequate sanitation, health care, and protective measures. The frequent transfer of people throughout the immigration detention system also contributes to the rapid spread of the virus. Moreover, unlike in criminal court, immigrants facing deportation do not have the right to a lawyer even if they cannot afford one, leaving most without access to legal representation. As local leaders seek to protect immigrant communities, safeguarding access to legal services for everyone is of critical importance. The Vera Institute of Justice created this guidance brief to equip local leaders with practical actions and policy solutions to ensure access to justice for all amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Key TakeawayTo protect equal access to justice during the pandemic, local leaders must act now, paying particular attention to those who are most vulnerable, including immigrants in detention or those at risk of detention and their families.Key FactsDetained immigrants with legal representation are3Xmore likely to be granted bond and 10.5X more likely to establish their right to remain in the U.S.RelatedPUBLICATIONCoronavirus Guidance for the Criminal and Immigration Legal SystemsMar 17, 2020SPOTLIGHTImmigrant Justice and the COVID-19 PandemicMay 13, 2020NEWSUnaccompanied Children Suffer as Hearings are Sped Up, Switched to Video During COVID-19 CrisisApr 14, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
