With regard to safety, the research was designed to address such questions as:1) is non-medical detoxification treatment more likely than medical treatment to be associated with sever withdrawal symptomatology?2) Is either of these modalities more likely to be subjectively viewed by its clients as making the detoxification easier and less stressful? 3) Are the medical programs (and particularly the hospital-based program) better able to identify and care for other medical conditions (in addition to withdrawal) the client might have?With regard to rehabilitation issues, the research was designed to address such questions as:1) Are clients treated in the medical programs more likely to complete detoxification?2) Are clients treated in the non-medical programs more likely to obtain and accept post-detoxification referrals, and are there differences in the types of referrals made by these programs?3) Are clients treated in particular modalities more likely to be readmitted for detoxification within a four-month follow-up period?AuthorsSusan Sadd34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
