It offered defendants counseling and job opportunities and, if the defendant cooperated and showed promise of permanent change, recommended that the prosecutor and the judge dismiss the charges against him without ever deciding whether he was guilty. Thus, the MCEP attempted to convert a participant's arrest from a losing to a winning experience.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
