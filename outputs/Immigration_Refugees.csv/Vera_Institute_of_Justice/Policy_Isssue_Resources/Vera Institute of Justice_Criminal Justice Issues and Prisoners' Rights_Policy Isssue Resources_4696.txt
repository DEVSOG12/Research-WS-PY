Dick Durbin of Illinois. Jacobson discusses the existing literature showing that zero-tolerance school discipline policies and the negative outcomes they engender by criminalizing even minor disciplinary infractions disproportionately affect minority students. And he describes research Vera launched in January 2012 to examine the connection between school disciplinary policies—in particular, those that approximate a zero-tolerance approach—and crime and delinquency outcomes among youth exposed to them.AuthorsMichael Jacobson34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
