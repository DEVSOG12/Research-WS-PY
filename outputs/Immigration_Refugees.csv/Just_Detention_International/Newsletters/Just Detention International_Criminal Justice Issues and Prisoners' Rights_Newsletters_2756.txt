JDI-South Africa Officially Opens Its Doors 
Prisoner Rape Survivors Show Deep Appreciation for Holiday Messages from JDI Supporters
Over the holidays, JDI supporters sent thousands of messages to prisoner rape survivors. Many survivors — 
including the men and women pictured above — replied to express just how much these cards meant. (Clockwise from left): Pedro (raped by his cellmate); Maribel (sexually assaulted by a staff member); Juvencia (sexually abused and harassed repeatedly by staff ); and Sarah (sexually assaulted by a staff member).

Forum — to fight for the human rights of prisoners, and worked with Sonke Gender Justice, a South African nonprofit orga -
nization, to produce the first-ever pub-lic testimonies of South African prisoner  
rape survivors.
To deepen its work in South Africa and 
build local expertise, JDI established JDI-South Africa ( JDI-SA) as an independent entity. JDI-SA — which was incorporated in November 2013 — is separate from JDI, but with the same mission: to end sexual abuse in all forms of detention. The JDI-SA team already has strong ties to leading activists and, following JDI’s example, will rely heavily on the wisdom of survivors of rape in prison. South Africa’s prisons, just like those in the U.S., are rife with sexual violence. First-time inmates, as well as gay and transgen -
der prisoners, are targeted with alarming frequency — a grim echo of U.S. prisons and jails. Again like in the U.S., the impact of prisoner rape in South Africa extends far beyond prison walls; upon release, in-mates bring all their experiences back to their families and communities. Among prisoner rape survivors, these often include untreated trauma and HIV. 
Despite the stark reality facing many South 
African inmates, JDI considers prisoner rape preventable — in South Africa, in the U.S., and worldwide. That conviction is a founding principle of JDI-SA, and it will always be at the core of its work. 
JDI-SA will also continue to work closely 
with dedicated corrections officials. Prison staff who are human rights champions — like the officers who started Friends Against Abuse — are essential to stopping prisoner rape. As one of Friends Against Abuse’s founders, Chris Malgas, put it, “These are human beings we are dealing with. Both the staff and the inmates, they can change. They will change, if we treat them with respect.”
3action  update                     
march 2014 | action  updateE very year, millions of people across America are arrested and placed in police lockups. For many, these short-term detention facilities 
are their first contact with the criminal jus -
tice system. Arrestees are often intoxicated, injured, mentally ill, and fearful about what’s going to happen next. If they are treated well and with respect, a police lockup could be their first and maybe their last detention ex-perience. If they are ill-treated, even a short stint in a police holding cell could have a devastating impact on their future. As such, police lockups are a focus of JDI’s work to keep detainees safe.
In October 2013, JDI launched a flagship 
project with the Los Angeles Police De -
partment (LAPD), to ensure that all LAPD lockups are free from sexual abuse. LAPD is one of the country’s largest law enforcement agencies, overseeing a population of 3.8 mil-lion people in dozens of communities spread across an area 15 times the size of Manhat -
tan. In addition to its community policing responsibilities, LAPD runs five detention facilities, which hold more than 100,000 people each year. 
“The Los Angeles Police Department is 
committed to reducing crime,” said Captain David Lindsay, the Commanding Officer of LAPD’s Jail Division. “That also includes keeping our jails as free from crime as pos -
sible. While people are in our custody, it is our job to keep them safe, and that includes sexual abuse. The partnership with JDI will help us do that job even better.” Los Angeles Police Department 
Works with JDI to Prevent Abuse  
Like jails and prisons, LAPD has a duty to  
implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act 
(PREA). By teaming up with JDI, LAPD has made it clear that this duty is a priority. JDI’s goal is to help LAPD facilities comply fully with the U.S. Department of Justice’s groundbreaking PREA standards, which JDI helped develop. JDI is working with LAPD to analyze and update its policies and prac-tices aimed at ending sexual violence and to train LAPD staff —  from top-level officials 
to recruits fresh out of the academy — in 
sexual abuse awareness. 
“JDI’s collaboration with LAPD is primarily 
about ensuring that detainees are safe from 
sexual abuse. But it’s also about stopping the devastating cycle of incarceration in which so many arrestees get trapped,” said Linda Mc -
Farlane, JDI’s Deputy Executive Director.
The impact of the LAPD-JDI partnership 
will be felt far beyond Los Angeles. The  
project’s overarching goal is nothing less  
than transforming law enforcement practices nationwide. “We believe that this is impor -
tant,” said Lindsay. “We are proud to be part of the effort to make lockups safer across the United States.”E
Every person has the right to be free from sexual abuse, no matter what. This idea — long championed by JDI — is at the core of a new in -
mate education video now being shown in prisons and jails nationwide: PREA: What You Need to Know.
PREA: What You Need to Know  covers in-
mates’ basic rights — and what facilities are 
required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) to do to safeguard their de -
tainees. Developed by JDI, in collaboration with the National PREA Resource Center, the video features a range of presenters: prison and jail officials, JDI advocates, and former inmates — including members of JDI’s Survivor Council. 
The inmate education video is not the only 
new resource from JDI. In December 2013, JDI published Hope Behind Bars , a detailed 
guide for rape crisis counselors who are interested in working with incarcerated survivors. The manual gives extensive tips on how advocates can navigate the prison environment and support the drastically underserved inmate population. New Human Rights

EI t took great courage  for Ca’Linda 
to report that she was sexually abused. 
She was an inmate at a Kentucky pris -
on, and her attacker was a high-ranking 
official at the facility. Having finally mus-tered enough courage to file a complaint, investigators did nothing. They called her a liar — if anything did happen, they said, it was her fault.
Ca’Linda’s story is devastatingly familiar.  
JDI regularly hears from inmates who  
report a staff member for abuse only to see 
their concerns dismissed while their attack -
ers get off scot-free. Ca’Linda’s abuser was back on duty just two weeks after she re -
ported him. 
A new report from the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) has confirmed that the fail-ure to hold staff perpetrators of rape ac-countable is a widespread problem. Based on official records from prisons nationwide, the BJS found that nearly half of staff who are known to have committed sexual mis -
conduct face no legal action. Indeed, 15 percent of known staff perpetrators — like Ca’Linda’s abuser — kept their jobs. 
The BJS study showed that in 2011, inmates 
reported 8,763 instances of sexual violence Prison Officials Known to Rape 
Inmates Remain Above the Law  
through official channels. Only 902 of these 
reports, roughly 10 percent, were substanti -
ated. The majority of cases were deemed to be “unsubstantiated,” or lacking in sufficient evi-dence — based on investigations conducted internally by corrections staff. 
These figures represent only a fraction of the 
sexual assaults that occur in U.S. detention facilities. Using data from its most recent in -
mate surveys, the BJS estimates that roughly 200,000 people were sexually abused in pris -
ons, jails, and youth facilities in a single year. 
“If you look at what happened to Ca’Linda, 
it’s not surprising that there is such a huge disparity between the number of official re-ports of sexual abuse and those made anony-mously,” said Lovisa Stannow, JDI’s Execu-tive Director. “For those of us who live in the outside world, it’s hard to fathom the obstacles to speaking out faced by prisoner rape surv-ivors. Every day, inmates tell JDI that they don’t report because they are threatened, or  
feel that nothing positive will ever come of it.” 
Ca’Linda’s abuser was finally fired — but only 
after he assaulted another inmate at the pris -
on. That assault, like all sexual abuse in deten -
tion, could have been prevented. When cor -
rections staff are above the law, no one is safe. INew Federal Report:
