just detention international  /T_he shift in staﬀ attitudes helped pave the 
way for much-needed reform. Using the PREA standards as a baseline, MDCR worked with JDI to create a hotline for inmates to report sexual abuse, and to set up con/f_idential rape crisis services for sur -
vivors — provided by community-based counselors. JDI helped train MDCR staﬀ  on eﬀective communication with inmates who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans-gender. Policies and practices were updated throughout the jail system. 
Corrections oﬃcer Pamela Stewart, who 
works in classi/f_ication, described how PREA has made her and her colleagues change the way they do their jobs: “We had to train staﬀ to slow down. In the past, the guy you were interviewing may have been crying, but you didn’t notice, because you never looked up. You never looked at the person sitting in front of you.”
/T_he deep change that has occurred in Mi -
ami depends on a commitment from the 
top. When faced with data showing very high levels of abuse at his jail, MDCR’s now-retired Director, Tim Ryan, decided to bet on PREA. “PREA has set the stage for a new world,” he said. “Miami-Dade is part of that new world and proud to hold hands with others set on the same path.” Testamark-Samuels echoed Ryan’s senti-ment: “Give PREA a try — it works. Mi -
ami-Dade runs the eighth largest jail in the country. If we can do it, so can you.”
Today, MDCR’s PREA program stands as 
a nationwide model. JDI, with OVC’s sup-port, is producing a resource guide to help other communities replicate Miami’s suc-cesses. In Miami, the fear of outsiders has been replaced by a desire to work with local organizations. Staﬀ see the value of having beliefs and practices challenged. Training Oﬃcer Sanya Houston said, “JDI made us all change. Sometimes jail staﬀ forget that inmates are human beings, but the JDI team wouldn’t let us. JDI shocked us, molded us, and praised us. And it worked.”

Perry rejected the PREA standards. To justify his decision, Perry argued that the standards would never work in Texas. 
Today, JDI is proving that Perry was dead wrong. 
In Texas’s Bexar County, JDI joined forces 
last year with the sheriﬀ ’s department to protect jail inmates from sexual abuse. /T_he partnership’s success shows that, contrary to Perry’s claims, PREA compliance is not a pipe dream. All it takes is some hard work and common sense.  
With JDI’s help, Bexar County has adopted 
pivotal reforms that are having an impact on staﬀ culture and improving the safety of its jail. Most notably, the county set up a free, con/f_idential hotline for inmates to get help — one of only a handful of counties na-tionwide to have done so. Last year, Bexar County passed its PREA audit.PREA in Action, Even in Texas
JDI’s project with Bexar County is one of many trailblazing partnerships nationwide. Last year, JDI worked with the Clallam County jail in Washington, the state prison system in South Carolina, and the Los An-geles Police Department. In 2015, JDI is collaborating with an equally diverse mix of agencies, launching projects in jails in Mari-copa County (Arizona), Los Angeles County, and throughout West Virginia, as well as state prisons in Virginia. 
Whether working in a tiny jail, like the one 
in Aspen, Colorado, or one of the largest jail systems in the world, like the one in Los An-geles, JDI emphasizes that dedicated correc-tions oﬃcials can — and must — keep in-mates safe. “Every single inmate has a right to be safe, in all detention settings. Even one sexual assault is one too many. Having said that, it’s especially exciting to see large, com-plex agencies, like the Los Angeles Sheriﬀ ’s Department, commit to PREA,” said Lovisa Stannow, JDI’s Executive Director.IThrough Words of Hope, JDI Supporters

/T_his year, you proved yet again that you care

You could not have known, my dear friends, how alone I have felt, but your cards came as a wonderful present, a gift of true love and friendship.”
Many other survivors echoed Milo’s feelings.

Another survivor who expressed profound 
appreciation for the cards is Winter. A trans-gender woman held in a men’s prison in Pennsylvania, Winter was raped by another inmate, her sense of worth shattered. She was disconnected from the outside world — un-til she got your messages. She wrote, “I cried like a baby when I received all of the beautiful cards from all of you. /T_hroughout my incar-ceration, I have been estranged from my fam-ily and just knowing I have your love gives me hope and strength to achieve my goals and help others who have become victims of sexual abuse.”
