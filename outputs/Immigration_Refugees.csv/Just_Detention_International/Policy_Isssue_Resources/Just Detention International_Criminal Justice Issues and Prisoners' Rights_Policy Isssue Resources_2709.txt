just detention international  february 2009 | fact  sheetWhile … movies  … 
have made light comedy 
out of prison rape, it’s not 
a joking matter. The mere possibility 
of being raped represents a serious 
form of torture for nearly all inmates 
and a prison punk’s daily reality is 
not something that any civilized 
nation should wish on even its most 
wayward citizen.

Sexual  violence in detention 
will remain a problem in the 
u.S. as long as flippant and ill-
informed public attitudes about 
this form of abuse prevail. Many people 
consider prisoner rape to be irrelevant to 
their lives because it happens behind bars. 
Others think that sexual abuse in detention 
somehow deters crime. Some believe that 
inmates who get sexually assaulted are 
especially violent, and conclude that they 
deserve the abuse. Still others think that prisoner rape is funny. each of these ideas 
is incorrect – dangerously so – but these 
misconceptions thrive because the general 
public knows little about the reality of 
sexual abuse behind bars. 
Prisoner rape does not prevent crime.  No 
causal link has ever been found between 
prisoner rape and lower crime rates. On the 
contrary, prisoner rape is in itself a serious 
crime that rarely is prosecuted. Moreover, 
studies have shown that sexual abuse in -
creases the overall levels of violence in pris -
on.2 Rather than serve as a deterrent, then, 
sexual assault in detention encourages more 
crime by creating a culture where such vio -
lence is permitted and often overlooked.
Prisoner rape victims are typically non-
violent with clear traits of vulnerability. 
While any inmate can become a victim 
of prisoner rape, marginalized and special 
needs populations are the must vulnerable. in women’s facilities, typical survivors of 
sexual abuse are non-violent, young, and 
mentally ill inmates.3 in men’s facilities, 
non-violent, young prisoners, particularly 
youth housed with adults, and gay and transgender prisoners have the highest rates of 
victimization.4 Once raped, an inmate is likely to 
be “marked” as a victim and repeatedly abused.5 
One recent study found that nearly 75 percent 
of male and 57 percent of female prisoner rape 
survivors were sexually abused more than once, 
and 30 percent of all survivors endured six or 
more assaults.6 in the worst cases, prisoners 
are treated like the perpetrators’ property and 
sold to others within the facility. 
No one deserves to be raped.  Whether per -
petrated by corrections staff or by other in -
mates with the acquiescence of officials, 
sexual violence in detention is a crime and 
a human rights violation. Sexual violence in 
detention amounts to torture under interna -
tional treaties ratified by the united States.7 
Both Congress and the u.S. Supreme Court 
have also recognized that prisoner rape can 
violate an individual’s constitutional right to 
be free from cruel and unusual punishment.8 
in addition to the rape and sexual assault laws 
that apply to everyone, every u.S. jurisdiction 
has a custodial sexual misconduct law that, at 
a minimum, makes it a crime for officials to 
have sex with inmates.9
Sexual violence in detention spreads disease.  
Prisoner rape victims are highly vulnerable to 
contracting hiV and other sexually transmitted 
diseases. The u.N. Office on Drugs and 
Crime states, “reducing the transmission of hiV in prisons is an integral part of reducing 
the spread of infection in the broader society, 
as any diseases contracted in prison, or medical 
conditions made worse by poor conditions of 
confinement, become issues of public health for 
the wider society when people are released.”10

International (JDI)
just Detention international ( JDi) is a 
human rights organization that seeks to 
end sexual abuse in all forms of detention. 
all of JDi ’s work takes place within the 
framework of international human rights 
laws and norms. The sexual assault of detain -
ees, whether committed by corrections staff 
or by inmates, is a crime and is recognized 
internationally as a form of torture.
JDi has three core goals for its work: to en -
sure government accountability for prisoner 
rape; to transform ill-informed public atti -
tudes about sexual violence in detention; and 
to promote access to resources for those who 
have survived this form of abuse.
 
JDi is concerned about the safety and well-
being of all detainees, including those held 
in adult prisons and jails, juvenile facilities, 
immigration detention centers, and police 
lock-ups, whether run by government agen -
cies or by private corporations on behalf of 
the government. 
When the government takes away someone’s 
freedom, it incurs a responsibility to pro -
tect that person’s safety. all inmates have 
the right be treated with dignity. No matter 
what crime someone has committed, sexual 
violence must never be part of the penalty.prisons was more than four times higher than 
in society overall.11 hepatitis C rates are 8 to 
20 times higher in prisons than on the outside, 
with 12 to 35 percent of prison cases involving 
chronic infection.12 The rates of infection for 
chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are likewise 
significantly higher among inmates than 
in the population at-large.13 in addition to 
contracting infectious diseases, many survivors 
of sexual abuse in detention are plagued by the 
destabilizing effects of post-traumatic stress 
disorder and rape trauma syndrome.14Sexual abuse is never a laughing matter.  
While joking about the things that make us 
anxious is sometimes a relief, humor can also 
trivialize and dehumanize. Regrettably, wise -
cracks about sexual abuse are commonplace, 
on late night television, in movies, and in 
popular culture generally. Such flippant atti -
tudes are one of the major obstacles to end -
ing sexual violence in detention and JDi has 
made it part of its mission to ensure that pris -
oner rape is described accurately – as a crime 
and a devastating human rights violation.
