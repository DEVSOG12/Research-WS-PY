just detention international  february 2009 | fact  sheetReducing the  
transmission of HIV in 
prisons is an integral part 
of reducing the spread of infection in 
the broader society, as any diseases 
contracted in prison, or medical 
conditions made worse by poor 
conditions of confinement, become 
issues of public health for the wider 
society when people are released.

Prisoner rape  victims are 
highly vulnerable to contracting 
hiV and other sexually trans -
mitted diseases. in 2004, the 
hiV prevalence rate inside u.s. prisons 
was more than four times higher than in 
society overall.2 hepatitis c rates are 8 
to 20 times higher in prisons than on the 
outside, with 12 to 35 percent of prison 
cases involving chronic infection.3 the 
rates of infection for chlamydia, gonor -
rhea, and syphilis are likewise signifi -
cantly higher among inmates than in the 
population at-large.4
While many inmates contract infec -
tions prior to incarceration or through 
non-sexual activity in prison, such as 
needle-sharing, the high rates of sexual 
violence behind bars is a clear source of transmission. according to the best 
available research, as many as 20 percent 
of male prisoners have been pressured or 
coerced into sex, and ten percent have 
been raped.5 in one women’s facility, 
more than a quarter of the women stud -
ied said they had been pressured into 
sex.6 contracting hiV through sexual 
assault can transform even a relatively 
short time in prison into an un-adjudi -
cated death sentence.
as prisoners return home – and 95 percent 
of all inmates are eventually released7 
– they bring with them the diseases 
that they acquired in detention. Men 
and women who did not receive testing, 
counseling, and treatment in prison are unlikely to have the knowledge, skills, or ac -
cess to the resources needed upon release to 
protect themselves and their loved ones. in 
short, infectious disease among detainees is 
a serious public health issue.
u.s. constitutional law8 and international 
treaties9 to which the u.s. is a party require 
that corrections officials take measures to 
prevent and control disease among inmates. 
unfortunately, few corrections facilities are 
willing to take even the most basic preven -
tative measures. Less than one percent of corrections facilities in the u.s. make con
-
doms available to detainees,10 even though 
many survivors of sexual violence report 
that they would have been able to negotiate 
the use of protection had it been available. 
harm reduction measures such as condom 
distribution are uniformly recommended 
by public health agencies addressing infec -
tious diseases in prisons.11 corrections staff 
often object to condom distribution on the 
ground that condoms pose a security risk 
and encourage prohibited behavior. how -
ever, the u.s. prisons and jails that do allow 
for condom distribution have never found 
grounds to reverse or repeal their policy.12 
organizations like the World health or-
ganization and unaids13 recommend 
routine screening for sexually transmitted 
diseases, voluntary testing and counseling for hiV, and early treatment for all infec
-
tious diseases. While less controversial than 
condom distribution, these basic measures are often unavailable to u.s. inmates.fact sheet

International (JDI)
just detention international ( Jdi) is a 
human rights organization that seeks to 
end sexual abuse in all forms of detention. 
all of Jdi ’s work takes place within the 
framework of international human rights 
laws and norms. the sexual assault of detain -
ees, whether committed by corrections staff 
or by inmates, is a crime and is recognized 
internationally as a form of torture.
Jdi has three core goals for its work: to en -
sure government accountability for prisoner 
rape; to transform ill-informed public atti -
tudes about sexual violence in detention; and 
to promote access to resources for those who 
have survived this form of abuse.
 
Jdi is concerned about the safety and well-
being of all detainees, including those held 
in adult prisons and jails, juvenile facilities, 
immigration detention centers, and police 
lock-ups, whether run by government agen -
cies or by private corporations on behalf of 
the government. 
When the government takes away someone’s 
freedom, it incurs a responsibility to pro -
tect that person’s safety. all inmates have 
the right be treated with dignity. no matter 
what crime someone has committed, sexual 
violence must never be part of the penalty.1  U.N. O ffice  ON DrUgs aND crime , HiV P reVeNtiON , care, treatme Nt aND sUPPOrt  iN PrisON
