INDEX TO DEPARTMENT’S QUESTIONS  
 
Question 1  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 15 
The Department solicits comments reg arding the application of this definition to those States 
that operate ―unified systems‖ —i.e., States with direct authority over all adult correctional 
facilities, as opposed to the more common practice of jails being operated by counties, cities, 
or other  municipalities. States that operate unified systems may be less likely to adhere to the 
traditional distinctions between prisons and jails, and may operate facilities that are 
essentially a mixture of the two. Do the respective definitions of jail and pri son, and the 
manner in which the terms are used in the proposed standards, adequately cover facilities in 
States with unified systems? If not, how should the definitions or standards be modified?  
 
Question 2  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 18 
Should the Department modify the full -time co ordinator requirement to allow additional 
flexibility, such as by requiring only that PREA be the coordinator’s primary responsibility, 
or by allowing the coordinator also to work on other related issues, such as inmate safety 
more generally?  
 
Question 3  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 19 
Should the final rule provide greater guidance as to how agencies should conduct such 
monitoring? If so, what guidance should be provided?  
 
Question 4  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 23 
Should the standard require that facilities actually provide a certain level of staffing, 
whether de termined qualitatively, such as by reference to ―adequacy,‖ or quantitatively, by 
setting forth more concrete requirements? If so, how?  
 
Question 5  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 23 
If a level such as ―adequacy‖ were mandated, how would compliance be measured?  
 
Question 6  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 24 
Various Sta tes have regulations that require correctional agencies to set or abide by 
minimum staffing requirements. To what extent, if any, should the standard take into account 
such State regulations?  
 
Question 7  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 24 
Some States mandate specific staff -to-resident ra tios for certain types of juvenile facilities. 
Should the standard mandate specific ratios for juvenile facilities?  
 
Question 8  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 24 
If a level of staffing were mandated, should the standard allow agencies a longer time frame, 
such as a specified number of y ears, in order to reach that level? If so, what time frame 
would be appropriate?    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 v  
Question 9  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ 25 
Should the standard require the establishment of priority posts, and if so, how should such a 
requirement be structured and assessed?  
 
Question 10  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 25 
To what ex tent can staffing deficiencies be addressed by redistributing existing staff 
assignments? Should the standard include additional language to encourage such 
redistribution?  
 
Question 11  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 25 
If the Department does not mandate the provision of a certain level of staffing, are there 
other ways to supplement or replace the Department’s proposed standard in order to foster 
appropriate staffing?  
 
Question 12  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 26 
Should the Department mandate the use of technology to supplement sexual abuse 
prevention, detection, and  response efforts?  
 
Question 13  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 26 
Should the Department craft the standard so that compliance is measured by ensuring that 
the facility has developed a plan for securing technology as funds become available?  
 
Question 14  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 26 
Are there other ways not mentio ned above in which the Department can improve the 
proposed standard?  
 
Question 15  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 27 
Should this standard mandate a minimum frequency for the conduct of such rounds, and if 
so, what should it be?  
 
Question 16  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 32 
Should the final rule contain any additional  measures regarding oversight and supervision to 
ensure that pat -down searches, whether cross -gender or same -gender, are conducted 
professionally?  
 
Question 17  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 37 
Should the final rule include a requirement that inmates with disabilities and LEP inmates be  
able to communicate with staff throughout the entire investigation and response process? If 
such a requirement is included, how should agencies ensure communication throughout the 
process?  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 vi Question 18  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 44 
Do the standards adequately provide support for v ictims of sexual abuse in lockups upon 
transfer to other facilities, and if not, how should the standards be modified?  
 
Question 19  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 46 
Should this standard expressly mandate that agencies attempt to enter into memoranda of 
understanding that provide specif ic assistance for LEP inmates?  
 
Question 20  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 50 
Should the Department further specify training requirements for lockups and if so, how? 
Would lockups be able to implement such training in a cost -effective manner via in -person 
training, videos, or web -based seminars?  
 
Question 21  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 56 
Recognizing that lockup detention is usually measured in hours, and that lockups often have 
limited placement options, should the final rule mandate rudimentary screening 
requirements for lockups, and if so, in what form?  
 
Questio n 22 ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 57 
Should the final rule provide greater guidance regarding the required scope of the intake 
screening, and if so, how?  
 
Question 23  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 66 
Should the final rule mandate that agencies provide inmates with the option of making a 
similarly restricted report  to an outside public entity? To what extent, if any, would such an 
option conflict with applicable State or local law?  
 
Question 24  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 67 
Because the Department’s proposed standard addressing administrative remedies differs 
significantly from the Commission’ s draft, the Department specifically encourages comments 
on all aspects of this proposed standard.  
 
Question 25  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 79 
Does this standard provide sufficient guidance as to how compliance would be measured? If 
not, how should it be revised?  
 
Question 26  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 80 
Shou ld the standard be further refined to provide additional guidance regarding when 
continuing monitoring is warranted, or is the current language sufficient?  
 
Question 27  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 90 
Does the standard that requires known inmate abusers to receive a mental health eval uation 
within 60 days of learning the abuse has occurred provide adequate guidance regarding the   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 vii scope of treatment that subsequently must be offered to such abusers? If not, how should it 
be revised?  
 
Question 28  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 97 
Should audits be conducted at set inter vals, or should audits be conducted only for cause, 
based upon a reason to believe that a particular facility or agency is materially out of 
compliance with the standards? If the latter, how should such a for -cause determination be 
structured?  
 
Question 29  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 97 
If audits are conducted for cause, what entity should be authorized to determine that there is 
reason to believe an audit is appropriate, and then to call for an audit to be conducted? 
What would be the appropriate standard to trigger such an audit req uirement?  
 
Question 30  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 97 
Should all facilities be audited or should random sampling be allowed for some or all 
categories of facilities in order to reduce burdens while ensuring that all facilities could be 
subject to an audit?  
 
Question 31  ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................. 97 
Is there a better approach to audits other than the approaches discussed above?  
 
Question 32  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 100 
To what extent, if any, should agencies be able to combine a PREA audit with an audit 
performed by an accrediting body or with other types of audits?  
 
Question 33  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 101 
To what extent, if any, should the wording of any of the substantive standards be revised in 
order to facilitate a determination of whether a jurisdiction is in compliance with that 
standard?  
 
Question 34  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 101 
How should ―full compliance‖ be defined in keeping  with the considerations set forth in the 
above discussion?  
 
Question 35  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 101 
To what extent, if any, should audits bear on determining whether a State is in full 
compliance with PREA?  
 
Question 36  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 103 
Should the final rule include a standard that governs t he placement of juveniles in adult 
facilities?  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 viii Question 37  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 103 
If so, what should the standard require, and how should it interact with the current JJDPA 
requirements and penalties mentioned above?  
 
Question 38  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 105 
Has the Department appropriately determ ined the baseline level of sexual abuse in 
correctional settings for purposes of assessing the benefit and cost of the proposed PREA 
standards?  
 
Question 39  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 105 
Are there any reliable, empirical sources of data, other than the BJ studies referenced in the 
IRIA, that would be appropriate to use in determining the baseline level of prison sexual 
abuse? If so, please cite such sources and explain whether and why they should be used to 
supplement or replace the BJS data.  
 
Question 40  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 105 
Are there reliable meth ods for measuring the extent of underreporting and  
overreporting in connection with BJS’s inmate surveys?  
 
Question 41  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 105 
Are there sources of data that would allow the Department to assess the prevalence of sexual 
abuse in lockups and community confineme nt facilities? If so, please supply such data. In the 
absence of such data, are there available methodologies for including sexual abuse in such 
settings in the overall estimate of baseline prevalence?  
 
Question 42  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 108 
Has the Department appropriately adju sted the conclusions of studies on the value of rape 
and sexual abuse generally to account for the differing circumstances posed by sexual abuse 
in confinement settings?  
 
Question 43  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 108 
Are there any academic studies, data compilations, or established met hodologies that can be 
used to extrapolate from mental health costs associated with sexual abuse in community 
settings to such costs in confinement settings? Has the Department appropriately estimated 
that the cost of mental health treatment associated wit h sexual abuse in confinement settings 
is twice as large as the corresponding costs in community settings?  
 
Question 44  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 108 
Has the Department correctly identified the quantifiable costs of rape and sexual abuse? Are 
there other costs of rape and sexual ab use that are capable of quantification, but are not 
included in the Department’s analysis?  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 ix Question 45  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 111 
Should the Department adjust the ―willingness to pay‖ figures on which it relies (developed 
by Professor Mark Cohen for purposes of valuing the ben efit to society of an avoided 
rape10) to account for the possibility that some people may believe sexual abuse in 
confinement facilities is a less pressing problem than it is in society as a whole, and might 
therefore think that the value of avoiding such an incident in the confinement setting is less 
than the value of avoiding a similar incident in the non -confinement setting? Likewise, 
should the Department adjust these figures to take into account the fact that in the general 
population the vast majority  of sexual abuse victims are female, whereas in the confinement 
setting the victims are overwhelmingly male? Are such differences even relevant for 
purposes of using the contingent valuation method to monetize the cost of an incident of 
sexual abuse? If ei ther adjustment were appropriate, how (or on the basis of what empirical 
data) would the Department go about determining the amount of the adjustment?  
 
Question 46  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 111 
Has the Department appropriately accounted for the increased costs to the victim and to 
society when the victim is a juvenile? Why or why not?  
 
Question 47  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 113 
Are there available methodologies, or available data from which a methodology can be 
developed, to assess the unit value of avoiding a nonconsensual sexual act involving 
pressure or co ercion? If so, please supply them. Is the Department’s estimate of this unit 
value ( i.e., 20% of the value of a forcible rape) appropriately conservative?  
 
Question 48  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 113 
Are there available methodologies, or available data from which a methodology can be  
developed, to assess the unit value of avoiding an ―abusive sexual contact between inmates,‖ 
as defined in the IRIA? If so, please supply them. Is the Department’s estimate of this unit 
value ( i.e., $375 for adult inmates and $500 for juveniles) appropria tely conservative? 
Would a higher figure be more appropriate? Why or why not?  
 
Question 49  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 114 
Are there any additional nonmonetary benefits of implementing the PREA standards not 
mentioned in the IRIA?  
 
Question 50  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 114 
Are any of the nonmonetary benefits set forth in the IRIA actually capable of quantification? 
If so, are there available methodologies for quantifying such benefits or sources of data from 
which such quantification can be drawn?  
 
Question 51  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 116 
Are there available sources of data relating t o the compliance costs associated with the 
proposed standards, other than the sources cited and relied upon in the IRIA? If so, please 
provide them.    Just Detention International

Question 52  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 118 
Are there available data as to the number of lockups that will be affected by the proposed  
standards, the number of individuals who are detained in lockups on an annual basis, and/or 
the anticipated compliance costs for lockups? If so, please provide them.  
 
Question 53  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 118 
Are there available data as to the number of community confinement facil ities that will be 
affected by the proposed standards, the number of individuals who reside or are detained in 
such facilities on an annual basis, or the anticipated compliance costs for community 
confinement facilities? If so, please provide them.  
 
Questi on 54  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 118 
Has the Department appropriately differentiated the estimated compliance costs with regard 
to the different types of confinement facilities (prisons, jails, juvenile facilities, community 
confinement facilities, and lockups)? If not, why and to w hat extent should compliance costs 
be expected to be higher or lower for one type or another?  
 
Question 55  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 118 
Are there additional methodologies for conducting an assessment of the costs of compliance 
with the proposed standards? If so, please propose the m. 
 
Question 56  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 119 
With respect to §§ 115.12, 115.112, 115.212, and 115.312, are there other methods of 
estimating the extent to which contract renewals and renegotiations over the 15 -year period 
will lead to costs for agencies that adopt the proposed sta ndards?  
 
Question 57  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 119 
Do agencies expect to incur costs associated with proposed §§ 115.13, 115.113, 115.213, 
and 115.313, notwithstanding the fact that it does not mandate any particular level of 
staffing or the use of video monitoring? Why or why not?  If so, what are the potential cost 
implications of this standard under various alternative scenarios concerning staffing 
mandates or video monitoring mandates? What decisions do agencies anticipate making in 
light of the assessments called for by this sta ndard, and what will it cost to implement those 
decisions?  
 
Question 58  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 119 
With respect to §§ 115.14, 115.114, 115.214, and 115.314, will the limitations on cross -
gender viewing (and any associated retrofitting and construction of privacy panels) impose 
any costs on agencies? If so, please provide any data from which a cost estimate can be 
developed for such measures.  
 
Question 59  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 119   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 xi Will the requirement in §§ 115.31, 115.231, and 115.331 that agencies train staff on how to 
communicate effectively and pro fessionally with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or 
intersex residents lead to additional costs for correctional facilities, over and above the costs 
of other training requirements in the standards? If so, please provide any data from which a 
cost est imate can be developed for such training.  
 
Question 60  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 119 
Has the Department accounted for all of the costs associated with §§ 115.52, 115.252, and 
115.352, dealing with exhaustion of administrative remedies? If not, what additional costs 
might be incurre d, and what data exist from which an estimate of those costs can be 
developed?  
 
Question 61  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 119 
Is there any basis at this juncture to estimate the compliance costs associated with §§ 
115.93, 115.193, 115.293, and 115.393, pertaining to audits? How much do  agencies 
anticipate compliance with this standard is likely to cost on a per -facility basis, under 
various assumptions as to the type and frequency or breadth of audits?  
 
Question 62  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 122 
Has the Department used the correct assumptions (in particular the a ssumption of constant 
cost) in projecting ongoing costs in the out years? Should it adjust its projections for the 
possibility that the cost of compliance may decrease over time as correctional agencies 
adopt new innovations that will make their compliance  more efficient? If such an adjustment 
is appropriate, please propose a methodology for doing so and a source of data from which 
valid predictions as to ―learning‖ can be derived.  
 
Question 63  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............................ 122 
Are there any data showing how the marginal cost of rape re duction is likely to change once 
various benchmarks of reduction have been achieved? If not, is it appropriate for the 
Department to assume, for purposes of its breakeven analysis, that the costs and benefits of 
reducing prison rape are linear, at least wi thin the range relevant to the analysis? Why or 
why not?  
 
Question 64  ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................ …12 4 
Are the expectations as to the effectiveness of the proposed standards that are subsumed 
within the breakeven analysis ( e.g., 0.7% -1.7% reduction in baseline prevalence needed to 
justify startup costs and 2.06% -3.13% reduction required for ongoing costs) reasonable? 
Why or why not? Are there available data from which reasonable predictions can be made as 
to the extent to which these proposed standards will be effective in reducing th e prevalence 
of rape and sexual abuse in prisons? If so, please supply them.

A. INTRODUCTION  
 
Just Detention International (JDI) respectfully submits these comments regarding the Department 
of Justice‘s proposed standards addressing sexual abuse in det ention . In its proposal, t he 
Department has clarified or strengthened several of the provisions recommended by the National 
Prison Rape Elimination Commission (the Commission)  and JDI applauds the Department for 
those accomplishments . Unfortunately, in its  20 months of review, the Department has also 
substantially weakened or removed measures that are urgently needed to keep men, women, and 
children in detention safe from sexual abuse.  
 
This submission highlights what JDI has identified as areas of improve ment and areas of concern 
in the Department‘s proposed standards . It also responds to the questions the Department posed 
in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. In addition to JDI‘s in -house expertise, these comments 
rely heavily on the expertise of dozens o f prisoner rape survivors, service providers, and other 
advocates with whom JDI collaborate s. 
 
I. About Just Detention International  
The only organization in the country exclusively dedicated to ending sexual violence in  
detention, JDI has three core goals  for its work: to hold government officials accountable for 
prisoner rape; to change ill -informed public attitudes about sexual violence behind bars; and to 
ensure that those who have survived this type of abuse get the help they need. Founded in 1980 
by a prisoner rape survivor, JDI‘s work is driven by the experiences of men, women, and 
children who have refuse d to remain silent about the sexual violence they endured while in the 
government‘s custody.  
 
Working with Congressional sponsors on both sides of t he aisle and a broad coalition of 
advocates, faith -based leaders, corrections experts, and prisoner rape survivors, JDI played a 
central role in securing passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). Since the law‘s 
enactment, JDI has been involved in  all aspects of PREA implementation. In addition to 
monitoring and disseminating information about the law‘s progress, JDI has connected federal   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 2 agencies that have  mandates under PREA with survivor advocates , and has provided these 
agencies with policy ana lysis and technical expertise related to all aspects of sexual violence 
behind bars.  
 
For the past several years, JDI has also collaborate d with state and local corrections agencies in 
their implementation efforts, including three jurisdictions – the Cali fornia Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Oregon Department of Corrections, and the Macomb County 
(Michigan) Sheriff‘s Office – that have agreed to become ―early adopters‖ of the Commission‘s 
recommended standards. Through its Raising the Ba r Coalition, JDI has mobilized more than 60 
organizations – including victim service providers ; faith-based groups ; advocates for immigrant 
populations, youth, and lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals ; and other 
civil rights organizatio ns – to be engaged in the standards ratification process.  
 
II. The Problem of Prison er Rape  
The Department‘s own data confirm the pervasiveness of sexual abuse behind bars, with an 
estimated 200,000 prison and jail inmates and more than 17,000 juvenile det ainees sexually 
abused in U.S. facilities in 2008 alone.1 These shocking numbers only begin to illustrate the 
problem. Survivors are often abused relentlessly, and marked as fair game for attacks by other 
detainees. In the aftermath of an assault, incarcer ated survivors experience the same emotional 
pain as other victims, which may be exacerbated by prior trauma and the inability to control their 
daily surroundings. In addition to physical injuries that are often inflicted during an assault, 
prisoner rape s urvivors are at grave risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted 
infections.2

general population. See, e.g., Laura Maruschak, Bureau of Justice Statistics, HIV in Prisons, 2007 -08 3 (2010)

 3 As the leading advocates addressing the problem of sexual violence in detention, JDI hears from 
prisoner rape survivors across the country  on a daily basis . JDI does not solicit such 
correspondence, and does not conduct outreach  to prisoners . Rather, s urvivors tend to hear about 
JDI through word -of-mouth and contact the organization simply because they feel they have 
nowhere else to turn.  
 
The following is a small s ampling of survivors who have been brave enough to write to JDI (and 
who have authorized the organization to share their story publicly ): 
 
 Scott Hill  was repeatedly physically and sexually assaulted by his cellmate in protective 
custody at USP Victorville.  A gay man who had been raped during a prior federal prison 
term, Hill was a clear target for abuse. He reported the assaults after he was transferred to 
another federal facility, where he was again placed in a protective custody unit. The 
Bureau of Prison s (BOP) took more than two weeks to provide Hill with the address for 
the FBI so that he could report his assault to them . The BOP also opened his legal mail 
and denied him legal calls. At the time of this writing, b oth BOP and FBI investigations 
are ongoi ng.  
 
 Kimberly Yates  was serving time at FDC -Philadelphia on drug charges when she was 
sexually assaulted in the prison warehouse by Officer Theodore Woodson. Yates was 
badly injured during the rape and spoke with a captain at the facility, after which she  was 
taken to the emergency room. A year before  Yates‘  rape, the family of another prisoner 
had contacted the facility to report Officer Woodson‘s sexual abuse of another woman, 
but the BOP never investigated that report. The officer went on to sexually as sault at least 
four other women, including  Yates . Eventually, Officer Woodson pled guilty to engaging 
in sexual acts with three women inmates and received a four-month jail sentence and 
three years of probation.3 
 
 Ivory Mitchell was repeatedly sexually ass aulted by a female corrections officer at L.C. 
Poweldge Unit, a Texas state prison. The officer groped him and forced him to perform 
oral sex on her while he was working as a porter. The officer threatened Mitchell that if 
he did not do what she demanded, she would report him for inappropriately touching her. 
Despite his fears, Mitchell reported the abuse, but was told that there was nothing that 
could be done. Eventually, the officer confessed, was terminated from her position, and 
                                                 
3 Further details about Kimberly Yates‘s experience are available in her submission to the Depar tment during its 
public comment period on the Commission‘s recommended standards (ID: DOJ -OAG -2010 -0001 -0190), in a 
testimony she prepared for JDI‘s website , www.justd etention.org/en/survivortestimony/stories/kimberly_ky.aspx ,

 4 charged with improper se xual activity with a person in custody. The officer claimed that 
the abuse was consensual, so Mitchell was punished with a disciplinary infraction, which 
halted his parole and resulted in him being transferred to a more dangerous unit where he 
was assaulte d by gang members.4  
 
 Valjean Royal has been sexually abused repeatedly in federal, state , and county custody. 
A transgender woman, Royal was only 17 years old when she was gang -raped by more 
than 20 inmates in a county jail. She continued to be sexually a bused while in prison and 
was transferred into federal custody for her protection. Royal was again sexually abused 
in two different BOP facilities before being returned to Indiana. She has mostly been 
targeted by inmates, but officers often contributed to the sexual abuse by looking the 
other way while inmates assaulted her , and sometimes by assisting perpetrators in gaining 
access to her. Royal contracted hepatitis C and syphilis as a result of the sexual abuse and 
describes herself as mentally and emotion ally numb from the repeated trauma.5 
 
 Linda Lamb  was raped by her bunkmate and another female inmate in a ―blind spot‖ at 
the Plain State Jail in Texas. Other inmates watched the abuse and did nothing to help 
her. As a self -identified lesbian, Lamb did not  feel safe reporting the assaul t; she was 
afraid no one would believe that she could be raped by another woman. Lamb was 
transferred to prison shortly after the assault, and never received medical attention or 
mental health counseling. 6 
 
 Scott Howard was repeatedly raped, assaulted, extorted, and forced into prostitution by a 
large, notorious white supremacist prison gang while serving time in Colorado. Because 
he is openly gay, officials blamed Howard for the assaults and refused to protect him. 
Howard repeatedly requested safe housing but was told that he could enter administrative 
segregation only if he named the assailants. On the day he was released from state 
custody, Howard was placed in a holding cell with one of his assailants, who beat him 
and for ced him to perform oral sex. While he was being abused in prison, Howard was 
too afraid to leave his cell and considered suicide.7

 Troy Isaac  was sexually abused repeatedly in California youth and adult facilities 
throughout more than two decades.  The fir st attack occurred when he was 12 years old 
and detained in a California Youth Authority facility for vandalism. Within days, he was 
propositioned for oral sex by a gang member in the showers and was later raped in the 
middle of the night by his 16 -year-old cellmate. Too scared and confused to report the 
abuse, Isaac told staff he was suicidal, hoping to be placed in solitary confinement, but 
they ignored him and the sexual abuse continued. For the next twenty years, Isaac was in 
and out of youth and adult facilities, where he was repeatedly sexually assaulted.8  
 
 Frank Mendoza  was detained for a non -violent public order offense in the Los Angeles 
County Jail. There, he was  persistently harassed by corrections officers for being openly 
gay. After a particula rly intense verbal attack, an officer beat and raped  Mendoza , leaving 
him naked and bloodied in his cell in the middle of the night. Mendoza reported the abuse 
the next morning, but rather than be ing provided with a forensic exam, he was given a 
shower. T he officer he told about the abuse did not write a report about the incident, nor 
was Mendoza provided with medical or mental health care. He was released a few days 
later and filed a formal complaint with the Los Angeles Police Department. The police 
condu cted a video interview with  Mendoza , but because there was no physical evidence, 
the police told him that the officer received a verbal warning and nothing else could be 
done.9 
 
 Allison Mitchell  was forced to perform oral sex on a male officer while she wa s detained 
at the Rappahannock Regional Jail in Virginia. The officer stalked Mitchell and 
threatened to harm her family if she reported the abuse. Other officials knew about the 
abuse and stalking, but did nothing to protect  Mitchell . Approximately a mont h after the 
abuse began, Mitchell reported the abuse to an officer, who did nothing except ask her 
what she expected for him to do. She told a lieutenant a few days later, and was taken to 
Internal Affairs, where one of the investigating officers told her that the assault was

 6 consensual. Mitchell was then transferred to another jail where she was retaliated against 
by inmates and staff and denied protective custody. She developed severe anxiety/panic 
attacks and suffered from nightmares, flashbacks, and che st pains. Mitchell received six 
mental health sessions after reporting the abuse ; her subsequent requests to meet with a 
counselor were denied.10  
 
 Michelle Branch is a 62 -year-old, transgender woman who was arrested in late 2006 and 
placed in the men‘s win g of the Los Angeles County Jail. At the time of her arrest, she 
had very limited mobility. During Branch‘s confinement, she was denied the use of her 
wheelchair. Other detainees were prohibited from helping Branch and she was forced to 
move about without assistance, falling on multiple occasions. One day while in the 
shower, she was surrounded and threatened with rape by four other inmates. The 
attempted sexual assault was interrupted when another inmate entered the shower and 
was able to fend off the woul d-be assailants.11 
 
 Brian Lee Nestor  was raped by another inmate at Fort Dix Federal Correctional 
Institution and contracted syphilis as a result of the attack. Immediately following the 
sexual assault, Nestor was devastated and in shock and was reluctant t o report the rape 
for fear of retaliation by inmates and staff. When he finally told a lieutenant, the officer 
told Nestor that if he filed any paperwork or otherwise complained he would be 
transferred to a prison in the south. After being transferred to N ew York Medical 
Detention Center, Nestor reported the rape to the BOP‘s Special Investigative Services 
(SIS). The BOP eventually placed Nestor in administrative segregation for six months. 
Nestor has suffered from anxiety and depression, and has attempted suicide , but the BOP 
has not responded to his repeated requests for psychological help. Nestor was recently 
informed that he cannot file a lawsuit since he did not file a grievance within 20 days of 
the incident.  
 
JDI maintains a database that compiles ag gregate data from the many letters it receives from 
inmates . While JDI‘s database of letters does not permit statistical conclusions about prevalence, 
it does provide rare, first -person insight s from survivors of horrifying sexual abuse.  
 
In calendar year  2010, JDI received letters from 534 survivors of sexual violence . More than half 
(277) of the se survivors stated that they reported the assault to prison officials, but an 
investigation was undertaken less than half the time (112). Eighty -eight survivors stated that they 
were placed in segregation as a result of reporting, more than half of whom (46) were placed

III. Sexual Violence in Federal Detention  
While the standards will apply to all corrections agencies, the Department  in its Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking pays special attention to its  own prison system, the Bureau of Prisons  
(BOP). BOP financial data – which has not been disclosed publicly – is relied upon in the 
Department‘s cost benefit analysis, and the BOP is held up as a model to justify some of the 
Department‘s most drastic revisions. Unfortunately, however, despite bei ng part of the 
Department, the BOP has not been a leader in PREA implementation and  sexual abuse remains a 
significant problem in BOP facilities. R eliance on current BOP policies and practices for national 
PREA standards is mis guided and dangerous .  
 
Altho ugh JDI has not worked directly with Bureau of Prisons  facilities , approximately eight  
percent (110) of the survivors who have written to the organization since 2003 were raped in a 
BOP facility. These incidents occurred in facilities that spanned 30 state s and Puerto Rico. Of the 
survivors who identified the type of person who abused them, 60 percent stated that they were 
abused by an inmate, and approximately 10 percent of these victims were assaulted by more than 
one inmate at a time. Thirty percent were  abused by a corrections officer and seven percent were 
abused by non -custody staff members, including a physician‘s assistant and work supervisor. 
One BOP survivor who wrote to JDI was abused by both inmates and staff.  
 
Nearly two -thirds (68) of survivors  from federal facilities  who contacted JDI stated that they 
reported the assault to prison officials, but an investigation was undertaken less than half of those 
cases (28 cases). A mere ten percent (11) of survivors reported that they were protected 
follo wing the assault and only 13 of these men and women reported that a forensic medical exam 
was conducted following the assault. Only four survivors (or less than three percent) received 
adequate medical or mental health  care in the aftermath of the sexual a ssault(s). HIV tests were 
given to survivors in only 11 cases; five survivors reported contracting HIV as a result of the 
sexual assault(s), and five reported contracting some other sexually transmitted infection.   Just Detention International

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 8 (Additional information from JDI‘s aggrega te data from survivors in BOP custody is provided in 
Appendix B.)  
 
Confirming the dire picture that emerges in inmates‘ letters to JDI, t he Office of the Inspector 
General has likewise noted that staff sexual misconduct is a serious problem in BOP faciliti es. 
Following up on a 2005 report, which found that staff sexual abuse in federal prisons was a 
serious problem and that many perpetrators  were not held accountable for such abuse , the 
Inspector General released a 2009 report that highlighted serious defic iencies in BOP policy and 
practice regarding staff sexual misconduct.12 Specifically, the Inspector General found that staff 
sexual abuse and misconduct allegations in BOP facilities more than doubled from FY2001 to 
FY2008, with nearly two -thirds of these a llegations involving criminal sexual abuse.13 The 
majority of allegations were cross -gender – male staff abusing female inmates and female staff 
abusing male inmates – with female staff committing a disproportionate amount of sexual abuse 
and misconduct and  male staff most often accused of misconduct stemming from pat searches.14 
The Inspector General identified deficiencies in several key areas, including staff training, the 
use of alternatives to isolating victims, victims‘ access to psychological and medic al services, the 
extent to which allegations were reported to the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of 
Internal Affairs, and oversight of the BOP‘s sexual abuse program.15 
 
While the BOP has not been a leader in PREA implementation, several sta te and county systems 
across the country have  chosen to make the effort to end sexual abuse in detention a high 
priority . The Commission‘s final report includes a chart of PREA initiatives in state and county 
systems nationwide.16 In the nearly two years si nce that report was released, several state and 
local systems have launched new and innovative PREA programs . For example, the California

 9 Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has established a n inmate  peer education program 
in two of its facilities , in which carefully selected and trained inmates provide information to 
other inmates about the right to be free from sexual abuse and the resources available in the 
aftermath of an assault . In addition, the Macomb County Sheriff‘s Office, in Michigan, ha s 
incorporated a section labeled ―sexual assault in the jail‖ into its policy for investigations of 
sexual assault in the community, acknowledging that jail is another place in their jurisdiction 
where assaults occur and that such abuse should be treated i n accordance with community 
standards.  
 
In short, several state and county corrections systems have emerged as leaders in PREA 
implementation and the critically important effort to end sexual abuse in detention. The BOP is 
not one of those leaders. JDI urg es the Department to reconsider its reliance on BOP‘s current 
policies and practices as models. Instead, it should encourage the BOP to embrace best practices 
that have been implemented in state and county systems nationwide.    Just Detention International

 10 B. DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED STA NDARDS  
 
As noted above, JDI believes that the Department  has made some positive clarifications and 
improvements to several of the Commission‘s proposed standards but is deeply concerned about 
the substantial weakening of many provisions. This section discu sses JDI‘s consideration of each 
standard  and answer s the questions posed by the Department. Unless otherwise noted, JDI‘s 
recommendations refer to the corresponding standards  for each type of facility – prisons and 
jails, lockups, community confinement, a nd juvenile facilities. For ease of discussion, the term 
inmate  is used to describe an individual held in any facility; in the recommended language, 
inmate  should be replaced by detainee  in the lockup provisions and by resident  in the community 
confinement  and juvenile facility provisions.  
 
I.  Definitions  
Facilities excluded from the proposed standards  
Excluding immigration detention and nonresidential probation and parole officers from the 
standards  contradicts the explicit intent and language of PREA, as  well as the Department‘s own 
statement that ―[p]rotection from sexual abuse should not depend on where an individual is 
incarcerated: It must be universal.‖17 
 
Just Detention International strongly urges the Department to restore the definition of ―prison‖  
relied upon by Congress  so that – consistent with all other aspects of PREA implementation – the 
standards apply to all forms of detention in the U.S.18  
 
Recommendation : Adopt the definition of “prison” that is in PREA:

18 While this discussion focuses on immigration detention, for the same reasons, the proposed standards should 
apply to domestic military facilities and tribal facilities. Inmates in these facilities are just as vulner able to sexual 
abuse as other inmates, and these institutions are generally even more isolated and less regulated than corrections 
facilities. Be it federal, state or tribal, when the government removes someone‘s liberty, it bears a duty to protect that 
person from abuse, no matter what type of detention he or she is in.

 11 In accordance with the law‘s definition of ―prison,‖ the legislative history of PREA recognized 
the law‘s application to both criminal and civil detainees.20 With respect to immigration 
detention, Senator Kennedy, a lead co -sponsor of PREA, explicitly noted his satisfaction that the 
law would protect immigration detainees , in his remarks at the first hearing of the National 
Prison Rape Elimination Commission.21 
 
Consistent with this history, federal entities charged with implementing PREA – in particular the 
National Prison Rape Elimination Commission and the Bureau of Justice Statistics – have 
included civil detention in their  mandate. The Commission held a public hearing that focused on 
immigration detention, convened an expert working group on immigration detention, included a 
section on immigration detention in its final report, and proposed supplemental standards for 
facili ties housing immigration detainees in its recommended adult prison and jail standards.22 
The Bureau of Justice Statistics similarly included facilities run by Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) in its collection of statistics on prison er rape mandate d by PREA. Beyond the 
urgent need for the standards in immigration detention facilities, where sexual abuse is rife, t he 
Department‘s dangerous statement that these facilities are beyond the scope of PREA will likely 
preclude further collection of vital da ta from these neglected facilities.  
 
Notably, w hen PREA was first drafted (in 2002), there was no Department of Homeland Security  
(DHS) ; the Immigration and Naturalization Service , which did then still exist,  was a division of 
the Department of Justice . While DHS was established by the time PREA passed, the transition 
of authority and scope of power were still being defined; even if they had foreseen this issue, the 
law‘s drafters would not realistically  have  been able to amend the statutory language in tim e.

 12 The Department‘s decision to exclude immigration detention also undermines the 
Administration‘s own efforts to reform the immigration detention system.23 Notably, in response 
to sexual abuse perpetrated by a transportation officer at Hutto Detention Cen ter – a Corrections 
Corporation of America (CCA) facility contracted exclusively with Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE)  – ICE requested a ―PREA audit‖ of its CCA -contracted facilities. To assess 
these facilities‘ PREA readiness, the recommended sta ndards were a key tool relied upon by the 
monitor  who conducted those audits .24 
 
If immigration facilities are excluded from the PREA standards , an immigration detainee in a 
local jail would be protected by PREA but would lose that protection if transferred  to an ICE 
facility. It is inconceivable that Congress intended PREA protection for detainees to be a matter 
of luck, depend ing on the facility that happens to confine  them.  
 
Efforts by ICE to address sexual assault through its own detention standards are important steps , 
but do not obviate the need for its facilities (as well as the O ffice of Refugee Resettlement  
facilities for unaccompanied minors) to be bound by the PREA regulations. ICE‘s performance -
based national detention standards are unenforceable,  subject to modification through collective 
bargaining, and lack the force of law. These provisions also do not include all of the measures 
that the Department and the Commission have deemed necessary in the proposed standards, 
including a means to ensure oversight and accountability.25

24 This audit was conducted in the fall of 2010, and therefo re the Department‘s proposed standards were not yet 
available. The auditors relied on the Commission‘s recommendations.  
25 For example, the I CE Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention Standard does not require that law 
enforcement be informed of a reported rape, that a criminal investigation occur, or that a criminal investigation be 
coordinated with any administrative investigatio n. As ICE‘s standards are nonbinding, they also do not include the 
internal and external oversight mechanisms found within the PREA standards.  Appendix C , infra,  is a list, compiled

standards.    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 13 Recommendation : Restore the supplemental standards for facilities housing 
immigration detainees.  
 
Whether housed in facilities exclusively used for immigration custody or in jails with criminal 
detainees, immigration detain ees are especially vulnerable to abuse. Language and cultural 
barriers, histories of state -sanctioned abuse in their home countries, and a fear that reporting 
abuse will result in deportation all increase the likelihood that a non -citizen will not feel saf e 
reporting sexual abuse and that perpetrators will not be held accountable. Unlike criminal 
defendants, immigration detainees have no right to an attorney, and as a result may not be aware 
of their right to be free from sexual abuse, nor whom to contact i f they are sexually assaulted.  
 
The Commission‘s supplemental standards addressed these disparities in an efficient and 
streamlined way. They included basic measures with minimal cost implications, such as 
requiring that staff receive cultural sensitivity  training, that detainees are informed about how to 
contact the DHS Office of the Inspector General and the Office on Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties, and that detainee victims and witnesses are not transferred or deported involuntarily 
during the course of a sexual abuse investigation. The Department‘s proposed standards for jails 
and other facilities that often house immigration detainees do not include these protections.  
 
Recommendation : Apply relevant community confinement standards to parole and 
prob ation officers.  
 
Excluding non -residential probation and parole officers from the standards is equally 
problematic, albeit for different reasons. These officers wield  as much , if not more,  authority as 
other corrections officials  do, as they literally have  power over the freedom of their probationers 
and parolees. Sadly, many probation and parole officers abuse  that extraordinary power to extort 
sex. Moreover, many people who are victimized while incarcerated will wait to tell someone 
until they are release d, with their parole or probation officer being an obvious first responder. By 
excluding these corrections players , the Department would dramatically limit the standards‘ 
overall effectiveness, even in residential settings.  
 
Clearly , not all of the standar ds could, or should, apply to non -residential community 
corrections. However, at a minimum, training and education, investigation and response, and   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 14 data collection are urgently needed in these settings. Probation and parole officers are 
instrumental in ens uring a consistent and continuous response to sexual abuse in detention 
throughout the U.S. criminal justice system. Failing to include them in the scope of the standards 
will dangerously and unnecessarily interrupt such urgently needed continuity.  
 
§ 115 .5 General definitions  
Overall the Department provides sensible and straightforward definitions. However, i n addition 
to restoring the definitions of prison  and community corrections  to include immigration detention 
facilities and parole and probation offi cers, respectively , within the scope of the standards, the 
definition of juvenile  should be modified to include all youth. Also, c onsistent with the 
Department‘s commendable protections for transgender and intersex inmates, these terms should 
be defined – and gender non -conformance should be included in relevant protections.  
 
Recommendation : Modify the definition of “juvenile” to : 
any person under the age of 18, unless otherwise defined by state law  or a person 
who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile justice system ,” and modify the 
definition of “juvenile detention facility” to specify that it is “a facility primarily 
used for the confinement of juveniles, including secure, non -secure, and community 
confinement facilities . 
 
All detained youth under the  age of 18 are at grave risk of sexual assault by virtue of their stage 
of adolescent development and relative vulnerability to adults. According to the most recent BJS 
survey of residents in juvenile facilities, a shocking one in eight was sexually assaul ted in the 
preceding year alone.26 The prisons and jails survey results do not specify the rates of abuse for 
youth in adult facilities ; however, in a survey of reports lodged with corrections officials, 42 
percent of victims of inmate -on-inmate sexual abus e were under the age of 25.27 All youth need  
the protections of the provisions for juvenile detention facilities, even if they are deemed adults 
by the criminal justice system.

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 15 The Department‘s proposed definition for juvenile , which relies on state law d efinitions, will 
create unnecessary confusion. State laws do not define adulthood  consistently;  a child may be 
considered an adult for some purposes, but not others. For example, parental consent laws for 
medical treatment may differ from the age of majori ty established for juvenile justice purposes. 
Further, state laws vary considerably on the age at which a youth may be prosecuted in the adult 
criminal justice system. More than half the states permit children under the age of 12 to be 
treated as adults fo r certain criminal offenses  
 
The standards‘ definition of juvenile  should include all youth under age 18, regardless of whether 
they are legally considered adults and prosecuted in the adult criminal justice system. This 
definition should also include peo ple over the age of 18 who are currently in the custody of the 
juvenile justice system, as many state juvenile justice systems hold people until the y reach the  
age of 21 or 25 if they were adjudicated as juvenile delinquents. Finally, the definition for 
juvenile detention facilities  should  be clarified to make clear that it concerns all facilities used for 
persons under the age of 18, including juvenile community corrections facilities.  
 
Recommendation : Add the following definitions to § 115.5:  
 Transgender : A term describing a person whose gender identity (internal, 
deeply felt sense of being male or female) is different from his or her assigned 
sex at birth.  
 Intersex : A term describing a person whose has a sexual or reproductive 
anatomy and/or chromosomal  pattern that does not fit typical definitions of 
male or female. Intersex medical conditions may also be called Disorders of Sex 
Development (“DSD”).  
 Gender non -conforming : A term describing a person whose gender expression 
does not conform to traditiona l societal gender -role expectations.  
 
The terms transgender and intersex are used throughout the regulations, but are not defined. 
Many corrections staff members lack a  clear  understanding of these terms and therefore, without 
further guidance, are likely  to misapply the strong protections intended by the Department. As 
discussed below (in § 115.41/241/341 and § 115.113), JDI urges that gender non -conformance 
be included in the definitions and added to the screening provisions . 
 
Question 1 :  The Department  solicits comments regarding the application of this 
definition to those States that operate ―unified systems‖ —i.e., States with direct authority   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 16 over all adult correctional facilities, as opposed to the more common practice of jails 
being operated by coun ties, cities, or other municipalities. States that operate unified 
systems may be less likely to adhere to the traditional distinctions between prisons and 
jails, and may operate facilities that are essentially a mixture of the two. Do the 
respective defin itions of jail and prison, and the manner in which the terms are used in 
the proposed standards, adequately cover facilities in States with unified systems? If not, 
how should the definitions or standards be modified?  
 
JDI does not anticipate that the curr ent definitions would pose any problems for unified systems.  
If the Department adopts the definition of prison  that is used in PREA,28 this term would 
encompass both prisons and jails.  Regardless of the definitions used, the proposed Adult Prisons 
and Jails  Standards have only one provision that differentiates based purely on facility type, 
rather than rated capacity. Section 115.81 requires that prisons ask inmates about prior sexual 
victimization and abusiveness, but requires jails to only ask about victim ization. The 
Department‘s justification for the reduced requirement for jails is based on a ―disproportional 
cost burden on smaller jails.‖ While JDI does not support this revision (see discussion below), 
even if it remains, the Department could also limit  this provision – as it does § 115.11(c),(d) and 
§ 115.13(d) – based on rated capacity.  
 
Recommendation : Clarify that co -located facilities need to implement the appropriate 
set of PREA standards at each unit in the co -located complex.  
 
While unified syst ems should be able to adopt the Department‘s standards without further 
guidance, co -located facilities (such as a lockup and a jail or an adult jail and a juvenile unit in 
the same building or complex) may not know which standard s should apply. In these si tuations, 
officials may choose to apply the standards that impose the least requirements or that apply to the 
largest set of their population. While JDI believe s that all juveniles should be removed from 
adult facilities, to the extent that juvenile s remai n in adult systems, those youth need the 
protections of the juvenile standards. To address these concerns, the Department should clarify 
that, while each unit or ward is only bound to one set of standard s, a co -located facility may need 
to implement more t han one set of standards as appropriate.  Thus, for example, a juvenile wing 
in an adult facility would be bound by the provisions for juvenile facilities, while the rest of the 
facility follows the prison and jail provisions.

   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 17 § 115.6 Definitions related t o sexual abuse  
JDI applauds the Department for recognizing the importance of distinguishing sexual abuse, 
which is covered by PREA, from consensual sexual activity between inmates. Corrections 
agencies remain free to establish disciplinary rules and regula tions as they see fit, but conflating 
consensual sexual activity between inmates with the crime of sexual abuse serves no legitimate 
purpose and thwarts many of PREA‘s goals. Indeed, doing so discourages survivors from 
reporting abuse or seeking medical as sistance, out of fear that the sexual abuse they endured will 
be misconstrued as prohibited consensual sexual activity and that they will face punishment if 
they file a report.  
 
Recommendation : Remove the subjective intent element in the sexual abuse defi nitions 
by modifying paragraph (4) in the definition for sexual abuse by another inmate, 
detainee or resident to:  
 “Any other intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the 
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or the buttocks  of any person, excluding  
contact incidental to a physical altercation  incidents in which the intent of the 
sexual contact is solely to harm or debilitate rather than to sexually exploit .” 
And modify paragraph (4) in the definition for sexual abuse by staf f to: 
 “Any other intentional touching that is unrelated to official duties,  either directly 
or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or the 
buttocks of any person , with the intent to abuse, arouse or gratify sexual desi re.  
 
The Department‘s definition of sexual abuse requires considering the subjective intent of inmates 
and staff who perpetrate sexual abuse. For inmate -on-inmate sexual abuse, the standard excludes 
―incidents in which the intent of the sexual contact is solely to harm or debilitate rather than to 
sexually exploit.‖ For abuse by staff, contr actors  or volunteers, the standard requires those 
individuals to have ―the intent to abuse, arouse or gratify sexual desire.‖ It is unclear why these 
distinctions matte r, particularly given that this language will require agencies to engage in a 
complicated time - and labor -intensive inquiry into the intent of the perpetrator. The standards 
themselves do not include any guidelines that would clarify these difficult inquir ies. 
   
Requiring proof of intent to establish sexual abuse contradicts the victim -centered approach that 
the standards and PREA appropriately have maintained. Unwanted sexual touching is 
unacceptable, regardless of the perpetrator‘s motive. However, the c urrent standards would 
deprive a victim of protections under the standards, even if an incident is particularly traumatic,   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 18 so long as the perpetrator did not intend to sexually exploit the inmate. The definition of inmate -
on-inmate sexual abuse already pro perly excludes consensual contact; the Department should not 
further limit the definition.  
 
With respect to staff -on-resident abuse, the Department may have concerns regarding situations 
in which staff members intentionally make contact with inmates in acc ordance with an agency‘s 
policies and procedures, such as during a search. However, this concern can be addressed by 
excluding touching that is related to official duties .  
 
Recommendation : Amend the definition of voyeurism as follows:  
Voyeurism by a staff  member, contractor, or volunteer means an invasion of an 
inmate’s privacy by staff for reasons unrelated to official duties, such as peering at 
an inmate who is using a toilet in his or her cell to perform bodily functions; 
requiring an inmate to expose h is or her buttocks, genitals or breasts; or taking 
images of all or part of an inmate’s naked body or of an inmate performing bodily 
functions , and distributing or publishing them . 
 
As written, the definition of voyeurism does not address when a staff memb er takes pictures of 
an inmate performing bodily functions, so long as the staff member does not distribute or publish 
those images. Whether or not staff choose s to distribute or publish those type s of images is 
immaterial; taking such images has no legiti mate purpose and clearly constitutes sexual abuse .  
 
II. Prevention Planning  
§ 115.11/111/211/311 Zero tolerance of sexual abuse and sexual harassment  
JDI commends the Department for requiring that the PREA policy outline s the agency ‘s 
approach to prevent ing, detecting, and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment. A 
mere statement of zero -tolerance is not enough to provide the leadership and guidance needed for 
safe facility practices and culture.  
 
Question 2 : Should the Department modify the full -time coordinator requirement to allow 
additional flexibility, such as by requiring only that PREA be the coordinator’s primary 
responsibility, or by allowing the coordinator also to work on other related issues, such 
as inmate safety more generally?  
 
The Department may allow for the PREA coordinator to have other responsibilities, as long as 
addressing sexual violence remains the highest priority and that other responsibilities address   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 19 related issues. The PREA coordinator must be able to provide sufficient  focus and attention to 
make sexual abuse prevention, detection, and response a high priority in each facility. Larger 
agencies and facilities will need a full -time coordinator to implement the standards  fully and 
meaningfully ; smaller facilities may find that a part -time employee is sufficient. Either way, 
these responsibilities should not be marginalized from the broader safety concerns to which they 
relate. Administrators who fail to recognize that sexual violence, physical violence, corruption , 
and othe r security breaches are all related will fail to address the root causes of these problems , 
such as deficiencies in staff training, hiring practices, screening and classification of inmates, and 
in investigation and response systems . The PREA coordinator s hould be able to operate within 
that larger framework in a manner that maintains a focus on sexual violence, as he or she assists 
with related concerns.  
 
§ 115.12/112/212/312 Contracting with other entities  
 
Question 3 : Should the final rule provide greate r guidance as to how agencies should 
conduct such monitoring? If so, what guidance should be provided?  
 
Inmates and residents need the full protections of the PREA standards, whether they are housed 
in public or privately -run facilities. Private agencies m ay conceal or minimize incidents or risk 
factors that could subject them to contractual penalties, result in the cancellation or non -renewal 
of contracts , or have an adverse impact on their stock performance or other contract 
opportunities.29 Moreover, as p rivate facilities are often outside of the jurisdiction where 
detention was imposed, victimized inmates and residents in these facilities are likely to be 
especially isolated and conditions in the facility subject to less scrutiny. At a minimum, private 
facilities should be monitored for compliance with the standards to the same extent as public 
facilities, in accordance with the audit provision.  
 
                                                 
29 In 2008, for example, a former manager  with the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA)  revealed that t he 
company kept two sets of internal audit reports – a detailed version with auditors‘ notes that was for in -house use 
only, and another version without the detailed notes, which was provided to government contracting agencies. The 
latter audit reports wer e reportedly ―‗doctored‘ for public consumption, to limit bad publicity, litigation or fines that 
could derail CCA‘s multimillion -dollar contracts with federal, state or local agencies .‖ Adam Zagorin,  Scrutiny for a

 20 Recommendation : Add the following paragraphs to this provision:  
(c) Private agencies or other entities responsi ble for the confinement of youth shall 
be audited by qualified and independent monitoring entities, in accordance with the 
criteria in § 115.93 and related criteria established by the Department of Justice . 
The reports and action plans arising from these a udits shall be made publicly 
available.  
 
 (d) Any new contracts or contract renewals with private agencies or other entities 
for the confinement of inmates shall include enforcement provisions to ensure that 
the private agencies or entities are in complia nce with the PREA standards. Such 
enforcement provisions shall include but not be limited to financial sanctions for 
non-compliance with the standards, as determined by the contracting public 
agency.  
 
Sections 115.12, 115.112, 115.212 and 115.312 should in clude specific guidance on how 
government agencies should monitor compliance with the standards in private contract facilities. 
While states and counties generally monitor contracts with private agencies, the scope and 
expertise involved in th e monitoring of the PREA standards is dramatically different from the 
audits required by Standard § 115.93 and the corresponding provisions for other facilities. Such 
monitoring is not conducted by an independent entity that is qualified to detect sexual abuse and 
provide relevant recommendations. It also may not include private communications with inmates 
and staff, nor result in any publicly available report or recommendations. Comprehensive 
review s and transparency are as necessary in contracted facilities as they ar e in facilities run by 
the government agency  itself . 
  
Worse still, t he Department‘s proposed standards do not provide mechanisms for government 
agencies to sanction private contractors that fail to comply with the standards. Given the profit 
incentives un derlying private corrections agencies, this is a dangerous omission indeed; t he 
standard should make clear that government agencies must enforce non -compliance with the 
PREA standards through remedies that include financial sanctions.  
 
§ 115.13/113/213/313  Supervision and monitoring  
The Department‘s decision to combine the Commission‘s standards on supervision and 
technology has some merit , as the  necessary  level s of staffing and of  surveillance  technology 
needed are interrelated. Likewise, the additional s tandard requiring agencies to take sexual abuse   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 21 prevention into account when designing or expanding facilities or installing or updating 
technology (Std. § 115.17/117/217/317) should improve the ability of agencies to deploy staff 
and technology appropriat ely moving forward.  
 
However, to reiterate  concerns raised with the Commission ‘s standards  and with regard to the 
Booz Allen Hamilton cost projection study,  adequacy in staffing and surveillance technology 
must be defined, and agencies must be provided wit h guidance on how to conduct staffing and 
technology analyses – the Department‘s proposed standards do not do these things.  Without such 
definitions and guidance, concerns about the workability of the standard remain, and the 
standard‘s potential  to ensure  that resources are available and allocated appropriately becomes 
significantly weakened. Moreover, the proposed standards allow agencies to subvert this critical 
requirement by allowing them to implement a plan for how to conduct staffing and video 
monito ring when adequate levels are not attained , without specifying consequences for agencies 
that fail to create and/or adhere to such plans.  
 
Recommendation : Remove paragraph (b) and modify the first sentence of paragraph 
(a) as follows:  
For each facility, th e agency shall determine the  develop and adhere to a plan to 
ensure that facilities establish  adequate levels of staffing and, where applicable 
video monitoring, to protect inmates against sexual abuse.  
 
The proposed standard lacks sufficient means  to ensu re that facilities are staffed adequately to 
keep inmates safe from abuse.  By suggesting that agencies determine  their own  adequate levels 
of staffing and video monitoring and then create a plan for what to do  if they fail to achieve those 
levels , the Depa rtment essentially permits facilities to operate at sub -optimal staffing levels  
indefinitely. While creation of a back -up plan is essential, it is not, in itself, enough. At a 
minimum, clear accountability measures must be built into this structure, whereb y PREA 
auditors (see § 115.93/193/293/393 below) have the authority to declare agencies non -compliant 
if they fail to create sufficient back -up plans, to adhere to such back -up plans, and/or to work 
toward achieving adequate staffing and monitoring levels.  The standards should not offer blanket 
exemptions from basic constitutional requirements to employ enough personnel to keep inmates 
and residents safe from harm. Rather, the standard s should help agencies to examine seriously 
their deficiencies and, if ne cessary, engage their legislators in adopting a feasible solution.   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 22 Whether by re -examining sentencing schemes and incarceration rates, or by re -appropriating 
funds, states and counties in such circumstances can often identify workable solutions.  
 
Recommen dation : Amend the second sentence of paragraph (a) as follows:  
In calculating such levels, agencies shall take into consideration (1) the physical 
layout of each facility, (2) the composition of the inmate population, (3) blind spots, 
including blind spot s in areas not designated for inmates (e. g. closets, rooms and 
hallways where staff perpetrators of sexual abuse could bring an inmate); (4) high -
traffic locations and busy times, such as when there is movement of a large number 
of inmates within the facil ity and during shift changes; (5) identified “hot spots” 
for abuse; (6) the ease with which individual staff members are able to be alone 
with individual inmates for extended periods of time; (7) the need to ensure that 
known perpetrators are directly obse rved when interacting with other inmates; (8) 
the need to ensure that inmates identified by facility staff as especially vulnerable 
receive additional protection  without being subject to extended isolation or other 
forms of punishment; (9) the ability to e stablish and retain video and other 
evidence of sexual misconduct; (10) compliance with any applicable laws and 
regulations on staffing requirements; and (11)  any other relevant factors.  
 
As the Department notes, ―determining adequate staffing levels is a complicated, facility -specific 
enterprise [that depends on a] variety of factors.‖30 Nonetheless, there are factors that should  
always  be taken into account when assessing staffing adequacy and that should be incorporated 
into the standard. For example, fac ility blind spots, hot spots for abuse, high traffic areas, and the 
ease with which individual staff members can be alone with individual inmates create conditions 
that contribute to sexual abuse. Likewise, staffing levels must ensure that known perpetrato rs are 
directly supervised when interacting with other inmates and that victims are not unduly isolated.  
 
Requiring consideration of these factors, which are known to contribute to the levels of sexual 
abuse, will help agencies  with limited resources figure out how to supervise inmates. JDI‘s 
suggested amendments to the standard would also provide auditors with concrete factors to be 
taken into account when monitoring  compliance with this provision. Agencies should be required 
to devise plans for staffing and electronic surveillance that include an assessment of relevant 
factors and a plan for redistributing or securing needed funds. Auditors would then review the 
sufficiency and feasibility of these plans.  The aforementioned considerations would also incre ase

 23 the likelihood of securing evidence of abuse , leading to greater agency accountability a s well as 
protect ing staff  against false reports.  
 
Recommendation:  In § 115.313, the standard should mandate that technology only be 
used as a supplement to direct supervision, not as a substitute.  
 
In any facility in which youth are held, they need direct supervision by adults who are  attuned  to 
youth interactions and potential conflicts. Continuous, direct, engaged supervision provides one 
of the best forms of prot ection  from abuse , as staff is more likely to identify signs of developing 
problems among youth when they interact with them regularly.  
 
Video surveillance cannot create the rehabilitative environment and personal relationships 
between youth and staff tha t are seen as best practice within the juvenile justice system. To 
achieve that goal, facilities must deploy trained staff to work directly with youth. The 
Department recognized this need in its Notice of Proposed R ulemaking, stating that 
―[a]dministrators  of juvenile facilities ... are typically more reluctant to rely heavily on video 
monitoring given the staff -intensive needs of their residents.‖  Limiting its value, v ideo 
surveillance systems rarely capture live audio , which severely diminishes their effectiveness as 
surveillance tool s. Staff who directly supervise youth rely on what they hear to help prevent 
dangerous situations from developing, taking cues from residents‘ conversations and changes in 
tone or inflection. Because video surveillance systems  usually  lack this feature, facilities that rely 
too much on such tools are compromised in anticipating and responding to events.  
 
Questions 4 -5:  
 Should the standard require that facilities actually provide a certain level of staffing, 
whether determined qualitatively, such as by reference to ―adequacy,‖ or 
quantitatively, by setting forth more concrete requirements? If so, how?  
 If a level such as ―adequacy‖ were mandated, how would compliance be measured?  
 
A quantitative blanket requirement for staffing at all facilities would not be feasible, given the 
wide array of facility -specific factors affecting staffing  needs , such as population size, security 
levels, and building architecture. However, providing no requirements makes this provision 
virtually unen forceable. With proper guidance, a qualitative standard can be established in a 
realistic, measureable way.    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 24   
As detailed above, many of the factors that contribute to high levels of abuse are known, and can 
be accounted for in assessing appropriate staffi ng levels. The data developed by the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics provides some information about when and where abuse is most prevalent. For 
example, of the incidents reported in the prisons and jails survey, more than half of all inmate -
on-inmate assault s occurred in cells  between 6 :00 p.m. and midnight, while staff sexual 
misconduct most often took place in a closet or locked office.31 In juvenile facilities, both 
resident -on-resident and staff -on-resident assaults were most prevalent in common areas, and  
between 6 :00 p.m. and midnight.32 Agencies should be encouraged to consider such data when 
assessing the needs in their facilities.  
 
Questions 6 -8:  
 Various States have regulations that require correctional agencies to set or abide by 
minimum staffing requ irements. To what extent, if any, should the standard take into 
account such State regulations?  
 Some States mandate specific staff -to-resident ratios for certain types of juvenile 
facilities. Should the standard mandate specific ratios for juvenile facili ties?  
 If a level of staffing were mandated, should the standard allow agencies a longer time 
frame, such as a specified number of years, in order to reach that level? If so, what 
time frame would be appropriate?  
 
The Department  need not require that one s tate‘s regulation become the standard for the nation. 
Rather, if as JDI suggests, the Department specifies  factors that must be considered in each 
agency‘s annual assessment, applicable state regulations should be a part of that analysis.  
   
The Department  should not provide a lengthened time frame for compliance with this standard. 
As discussed above, appropriate staffing to keep inmates safe is a basic  function of all 
corrections settings and a constitutional requirement. Agencies that cannot adequately s upervise 
the people in their charge must address that problem as a matter of urgency and must be held 
accountable to ensure that solutions are implemented . A time frame determined by the 
Department would also fail to account for the significant  differences  between facilities and 
agencies. Establishing one time frame to fit all circumstances would set the bar disturbingly low.

 25 To the extent that facilities are unable to provide adequate staffing, such a failure should be 
addressed the same way as other forms  of noncompliance: requiring the agency to establish a 
clear action plan as soon as possible, and having that plan approved and monitored by the PREA 
auditor.  
 
Questions 9 -11:  
 Should the standard require the establishment of priority posts, and if so, how  should 
such a requirement be structured and assessed?  
 To what extent can staffing deficiencies be addressed by redistributing existing staff 
assignments? Should the standard include additional language to encourage such 
redistribution?  
 If the Department does not mandate the provision of a certain level of staffing, are 
there other ways to supplement or replace the Department’s proposed standard in 
order to foster appropriate staffing?  
 
Areas of a facility where it is known that sexual abuse is likely to o ccur must be monitored by 
staff, not just cameras. Where known perpetrators are interacting with other inmates, for 
example, an officer must be present who can respond immediately to any problems. Given that a 
substantial proportion of sexual assaults take  place in cells and dormitories, these are also areas 
that must be monitored by staff, and not primarily by cameras. Further, cameras should not be 
used to monitor areas where inmates are in states of undress (showers, toilets, etc.), unless there 
are priv acy screens to ensure that cameras do not film an inmate‘s intimate body parts. It may be 
helpful for the Department to identify such priority posts – however, agencies should also be 
required to do so themselves, and to incorporate this information into t heir assessment plan s, to 
account for different culture s and needs of each institution.  
 
In some facilities, redistribution of staff may be the most cost -effective way to ensure adequate 
supervision. The Department should encourage the incorporation of such redistribution into 
assessments and plans, as appropriate. However, the Department must be clear that agencies are 
required to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and qualified for whatever new posts are 
created or assigned.  
 
As discussed above, JDI urges the Department to include factors that must be considered in 
assessing whether the level of staffing is appropriate. Rather than providing strict formulas, or no   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 26 substantive guidance, t he inclusion of such factors will help agencies remain focus ed on what is 
needed to keep inmates and residents safe from sexual abuse.  
 
Questions 12 -13:  
 Should the Department mandate the use of technology to supplement sexual abuse 
prevention, detection, and response efforts?  
 Should the Department craft the standar d so that compliance is measured by ensuring 
that the facility has developed a plan for securing technology as funds become 
available?  
 
There is no one quick fix for agencies to improve their supervision efforts. Technology is an 
invaluable supplement to direct supervision when used appropriately in the proper settings. In 
juvenile institutions, the Department should emphasize the value and importance of direct 
supervision.  
 
In all facilities, the use of technology should be part of the PREA -related superv ision 
assessment s and plan s, as deemed appropriate by the agency and the auditor. In addition to 
mandating that a plan be developed for adequate supervision generally, the Department should 
ensure that the plan is feasible. Limited resources unquestionably  create challenges, but states 
should be pressured to prioritize these needs in their decision -making. Costs cannot justify any 
dereliction of the core duty of corrections agencies to keep inmates safe .33 
 
Question 14 : Are there other ways not mentioned abo ve in which the Department can 
improve the proposed standard?  
 
As discussed above, the Department must provide criteria for assessing the adequacy of 
supervision and  the use of  technology , includ ing concrete measurable factors, and require 
agencies to take  steps to achieve these goals.

 27 Recommendation : All facilities should have a policy and practice of having 
intermediate -level or high -level supervisors conduct and document unannounced 
rounds on a regular basis, regardless of rated capacity.  
 
Unannounced rounds are an essential part of institutional management and oversight. They 
provide a low -cost, high -impact way for agencies to identify problems within their facilities and 
to ensure that policies are properly implemented. While the appropriate frequency  of such rounds 
may vary by facility size and structure, they must be conducted on a regular basis in order to be 
effective. There is simply no reason why this form of surveillance should not be required 
everywhere as part of a comprehensive plan for ensur ing inmate safety.  
 
Question 15 : Should this standard mandate a minimum frequency for the conduct of such 
rounds, and if so, what should it be?  
 
The practice of conducting unannounced inspections should be normalized through frequent 
rounds, and be requir ed in all facilities – regardless of population count. The frequency may vary 
by facility size, but even the smallest facility will benefit by having a high -level supervisor 
conduct rounds on a regular basis. The diversity among institutions makes it diffi cult for the 
Department to specify a minimum frequency of rounds. Providing a specific frequency may also 
take away from the value of having them be unannounced, as regular frequency rounds will 
allow staff and inmates to estimate when the next round is li kely to occur. Rather, the 
Department should require that rounds be staggered (so there is no set time between rounds) and 
that they occur often enough to prevent abuse.  
 
Recommendation : Lockups provision § 115.113(d) should identify known vulnerability 
factors by adding the following sentence to this paragraph:  
Law enforcement staff treat the following as indicators of vulnerability to sexual 
abuse: mental or physical disability; young age; slight build; nonviolent history; 
identification as lesbian, gay,  bisexual, transgender, or intersex; gender non -
conforming appearance; prior sexual victimization; and the detainee’s own 
perception of vulnerability .  
 
Not all lockup facilities will be able to conduct systematic risk screening for all detainees, or will 
need to if they generally have more cells than detainees. Nonetheless, the Department rightly 
requires those that do intake screenings to address vulnerabilities to sexual abuse. However, to be 
effective, this provision must inform facility staff of what t hey need to consider in making this   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 28 assessment. Accordingly, the standard should list the known indicators of vulnerability that can 
be determined by asking the detainee or through observation .  
 
§ 115.14/114/214/314 Limits to cross -gender viewing and sear ches 
The Department recognizes that, ideally, officers supervising inmates of the opposite sex would 
not conduct pat searches or view them in states of undress. Nonetheless, the proposed standard 
makes no meaningful effort to limit these dangerous practice s.  
 
The BJS surveys confirm that sexual abuse  of inmates and residents  by staff members of the 
opposite sex is pervasive in prisons, jails , and juvenile facilities.34 Authorizing officers to touch 
inmates of the opposite gender and to view them in states o f undress is simply bad policy, often 
leading to abuse and a sexualized institutional culture. As the Ninth Circuit recently noted, ―[i]t 
is not surprising that a connection has been made between cross -gender searches and the level of 
sexual impropriety be tween inmates and corrections personnel.‖35 In addition to inciting sexual 
abuse, the lack of bodily privacy and integrity that stem from cross -gender searches can be 
especially problematic to someone with a history of abuse, often triggering prior trauma.36  
 
Recommendation : Limit cross -gender pat searches to emergency situations, by adding 
it to the list of searches in paragraph (a), and deleting paragraph (e).  
 
The Department‘s revisions to the limitations on cross -gender searches conform to BOP policy, 
but disregard the progression of state agencies toward the best practice of significantly limiting 
cross -gender pat searches.37 In relying on the BOP as a model, the Department also ignores

37 In a 1 999 prison survey by the National Institute of Corrections , only seven systems reported a policy allowing 
routine cross -gender pat -downs in female facilities. By 2001, four of those states began prohibiting male pat 
searches of women prisoners, leaving the  federal system and two states in the extreme minority. Half of the states 
reported prohibiting cross -gender searches in male facilities. National Institute of Corrections Prisons Division and

 29 known problems with the BOP‘s pat search policy. According to a 2009 report by the Inspector 
General, ―BOP officials believed that male staff members were most often accused of sexual 
misconduct stemming from pat searches.‖38 The BJS prisons and jails survey confirm a similar 
link between pat searches and sexual touching by staff39 – indeed, a significant proportion of 
sexual abuse in detention begins during pat searches, before escalating into more severe forms of 
sexual violence.  
 
As acknowledged in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, juvenile systems have largely 
restrict ed cross -gender pat searches and viewing  to emergency situations. While adult facilities 
face different challenges and generally have more significant security needs  than youth facilities , 
with proper incentives, they could establish similar solutions to thos e that have worked for 
juvenile agencies.  
 
Outside of the federal system, many women‘s facilities have also limit ed cross -gender 
supervision. When confronted with these issues, judges are increasingly recognizing that limiting 
cross -gender viewing and sear ches may be constitutionally necessary.40 In some jurisdictions 
such limitations have been imposed, either as injunctive relief in civil rights litigation or upon the 
Department‘s recommendations pursuant to a CRIPA investigation.41 A recent case decided en 
banc by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the search of a male jail inmate by a female 
cadet, who touched his thighs, buttocks, and genital areas over a thin pair of boxer shorts , 
amounted to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Ame ndment.42 Many of these 
precedents acknowledge the link between cross -gender  supervision and sexual abuse.43

The models and precedents created in juvenile institutions and women‘s prisons should apply to 
all facilities. Contrary to widespread  misperceptio ns, the Department itself has found that staff 
sexual abuse is even more prevalent in men‘s and boy‘s facilities than in facilities for women and 
girls, making clear that these basic measures are urgently needed everywhere.44  
 
The Commission, in its work, was aware of recent judicial precedent (both with respect to 
inmates‘ privacy rights and officers‘ employment opportunities) and of  the financial and legal 
concerns of corrections officials. While it initially sought  to limit cross -gender supervision in an y 
area of a facility where inmates disrobe or perform bodily functions – which, consistent with 
international human rights standards,45 is the norm in most Western countries – the Commission 
consulted with officials about their concerns and ultimately limit ed its recommendations to 
searches and the actual viewing of inmates who are nude or performing bodily functions. This 
compromise is consistent with professional standards and emerging best practices.46 
 
The dangers of cross -gender pat -down searches are not  sufficiently mitigated  by creating an 
exception for inmates who can demonstrate that they have suffered ―documented prior cross -
gender sexual abuse while incarcerated.‖47 Indeed, this proposal makes a mockery of the realities 
of sexual abuse in detention. One drawback of  this exception is that it places the burden on 
previously victimized inmates to provide documentation and to ensure that officers conducting 
searches are aware that they meet the exception, negating any proper checks in place that limit 
such information to a need -to-know basis. The Department‘s standards should instead give such

 31 responsibility to corrections agencies, which have a duty to keep inmates safe from abuse. This 
exception also requires inmates to have filed and had  substantiated  a report of abuse, even 
though the vast majority of sexual abuse survivors are too afraid to file a report and the vast 
majority of those who do so find that their reports are not substantiated. This is especially true in 
cases of abusive searches, where th ere is rarely physical evidence  of the abuse . Moreover, this 
exception ignores the traumatic and devastating impact of these searches on inmates who were 
sexually victimized in the community , as well as the prevalence of staff abuse of inmates who 
were not  previously assaulted in detention.  
 
In its Initial Regulatory Impact Assessment, the Department justifies its substantial weakening of 
the Commission‘s standard by claiming that ―a number of facilities interpreted [this provision] as 
requiring them eithe r to hire significant numbers of additional male staff or to lay off significant 
numbers of female staff, due to the overwhelmingly male inmate population and substantial 
percentage of female staff,‖ which could violate equal employment opportunity laws.48 This 
justification under scores serious  problems with the data relied upon by the Department. Booz 
Allen Hamilton asked officials to estimate what it would cost to  comply with the standards, 
without providing any incentive for them to think creatively or id entify the most  cost-effective 
way of doing so. Not surprisingly , administrators (who ultimately need to defend their budgets to 
appropriators and therefore have no reason to minimize estimated costs) offered what they saw 
as the easiest solution s.  
 
Howev er, contrary to the assertions of  some corrections officials, these requirements can be met 
with low -cost solutions that conform to employment law and do not require significant additional 
hiring. For example, ―roving officer‖ positions can be established to ensure that an officer of the 
same gender as the inmates is available to conduct searches without requiring significant changes 
in personnel.49 In non -emergency situations, intrusive searches that require bodily exposure or 
physical contact can be limite d to areas that serve as potential entry -points for contraband. While

49 While the gender breakdown of staff may not match the gender breakdown of inmates,  facilities generally have 
enough officers of each gender to employ roving officers. JDI has been told that such a practice has been accepted in 
collective bargaining agreements.    Just Detention International

 32 many agencies  conduct frequent cursory pat searches throughout their facilit ies, focusing staff 
efforts by emphasizing  thorough searches at key places will aid in the  confiscation of con traband 
at its point of entry into the facility, reduce complaints about harassing searches, and free up staff 
resources for other safety and security measures.  
 
Question 16 : Should the final rule contain any additional measures regarding oversight 
and su pervision to ensure that pat -down searches, whether cross -gender or same -gender, 
are conducted professionally?  
 
Regardless of whether cross -gender pat searches are limited, the proposed standard‘s 
requirement that security staff receive training in how to conduct cross -gender pat searches 
professionally, respectfully, and in the least intrusive manner possible consistent with security 
needs remains important – and should be incorporated into the staff training provision. Staff 
should also be educated on how  to conduct a proper same -gender pat search, as these searches 
can also be violating and abusive  if performed improperly. Consistent with the government 
findings that staff sexual misconduct is often linked to pat searches,50 JDI regularly hears from 
inmate s who have endured abusive pat searches – both cross -gender and same sex, at men‘s and 
women‘s facilities.  
 
Recommendation : Require cross -gender pat searches to be documented, in the same 
manner as strip and body cavity searches, by removing the word “such ” from 
paragraph (b).  
 
The Department should also require documentation of all cross -gender searches. Documenting 
these searches can be useful in monitoring staff sexual misconduct, particularly when it arises 
from a pat search. Through documentation, supe rvisors will be able to assess whether officers 
accused of sexual misconduct are conducting these searches unnecessarily, and whether there is a 
link between the performance of cross -gender pat searches and complaints of sexual misconduct.  
Moreover, this p rocedural step will help dissuade the overuse of such searches, encouraging the 
use of same gender officers for pat searches when possible to minimize paperwork.  
 
Recommendation : Do not allow staff to view inmates and residents of the opposite 
gender in s tates of undress “incidental to routine cell checks.”

viewing and any  incentives for agencies to limit this dangerous practice. In many facilities, 
inmates and residents undress, use the toilet, and sometimes wash in their cells. Officers  should 
be prohibited from  viewing inmates and residents of the opposite sex at these t imes in non -
emergency situations.  
 
As with cross -gender pat searches, low and no -cost measures can provide a base level of bodily 
privacy in detention . For example, officers of the opposite gender can be required to announce 
themselves prior to entering th e cell block. Alternate ly, inmates or residents can be provided with 
tools to shield their body – e.g. with towels  or privacy screens – while performing these 
functions.  
 
Recommendatio n: Do not allow for searches of transgender inmates solely to 
determine genital status, by replacing paragraph (d) with the following:  
The facility shall not search or physically examine a transgender or intersex inmate 
for the sole purpose of determining genital status. If an inmate’s genital status is 
unknown, it may be dete rmined during routine intake medical examinations that all 
inmates are required to undergo, by reviewing medical records , or by speaking with 
the inmate.  
 
The proposed standard rightly recognizes that transgender and intersex inmates are at acute risk 
for sexually abusive searches, and that determining an inmate‘s genital status frequently is a 
pretext for abuse. Strip searching transgender or intersex inmates (or touching their genitals) for 
the sole purpose of determining their genital status is emotiona lly and sexually abusive, even if 
the search is called an examination and is conducted by a medical practitioner in private. 
Permitting medical practitioners to touch a transgender or intersex resident‘s genitals or requiring 
an inmate to undress in front of a medical practitioner solely so that the practitioner can look at 
his or her genitals is an unnecessary and inherently traumatic experience and presents serious 
potential for abuse .

 34 The standard should prohibit searches or medical examinations for th e sole purpose of 
determining genital status. In the very limited circumstances where this information is needed by 
a facility, it should be determined during routine medical examinations at intake or from the 
resident, from medical records, or from other reliable sources.  
 
Recommendatio n: Specify what a cross -gender search means in the context of 
transgender and intersex inmates, but adding the following provision to this standard:  
For purposes of determining what constitutes a same -gender search of a 
transgender or intersex inmate, the facility shall ask the inmate to specify whether 
he or she would feel safest being searched by male or female staff and shall 
accommodate such requests except in the case of emergency or other unforeseen 
circumstances .  
 
With no formal guidance stating who shall administer routine searches of transgender and 
intersex inmates, these inmates are likely to be subjected to cross -gender searches from which 
the proposed regulations protect other residents. Transgender and intersex inmates are known to 
be especially targeted for harassment and abuse, 51 and also have particular privacy and safety 
needs that are compromised  by cross -gender searches.  In order to address the safety concerns of 
transgender and intersex inmates and protect  their privacy and dignity, the Department should 
specify how the restrictions on cross -gender searches and supervision apply to transgender and 
intersex inmates.   
 
The best practice for doing so is to ask transgender and intersex individuals by which gend er 
they would feel most safe being searched, and accommodating this preference whenever 
possible. This pragmatic approach is currently used by the New York State Office of Children 
and Family Services in its juvenile facilities, and by the Cumberland Count y Sherriff‘s Office in

 35 Maine.52 A similar approach has recently been adopted by the UK government for searches by 
police and corrections officers.53 
 
However, if a general presumption is needed about who should conduct searches of transgender 
and intersex in dividuals, all such searches should be conducted by female staff. Transgender and 
intersex individuals, regardless of gender identities, are often perceived as female and/or 
feminine and are at considerably higher risk of being targeted for abuse and haras sment by male 
staff.  
 
§ 115.15/115/215/315 Accommodating inmates with special needs  
As the Department acknowledges, federal civil rights laws require agencies receiving federal 
assistance to provide inmates with disabilities or limited English proficiency (LEP) with 
meaningful access to programs and services.54 The proposed standards provide LEP inmates, 
deaf inmates, and inmates with a disability with education  about PREA -related policies . 
However, they fall short on ensuring that these inmates have suffici ent access to reporting, and 
necessary assistance during investigation s and response efforts.  
 
Recommendation : Amend paragraph (a) to require agencies :  
to ensure that inmates who are limited English proficient, or deaf, or have a 
disability  disabled  are a ble to report sexual abuse and sexual harassment to staff 
directly and through at least one other established reporting mechanism . 
 
Inmates with disabilities and LEP inmates are among the most vulnerable to abuse, in part 
because they often contend with ba rriers to effective communication with facility staff. Ensuring 
that special needs inmates can report to staff is an important first step, but accommodations 
should be made to ensure that inmates with disabilities, deaf inmates, and LEP inmates have 
multip le reporting options. Like other victimized inmates, inmates with disabilities and other 
                                                 
52 It is also used in other settings in t he United States, such as by the District of Columbia Police Department. Police 
departments in several Canadian jurisdictions, including Toronto, Vancouver, and Edmonton, have adopted a similar 
policy following a 2006 ruling by the Ontario Human Rights Com mission.

 36 special needs are unlikely to feel safe reporting staff sexual misconduct if their only option for 
reporting is to the perpetrating staff member or a colleague of the perpetrator. Disabilities that 
impair an inmate‘s vision, hearing or mobility, for example, may make it particularly difficult  to 
report sexual abuse or harassment and to comply with administrative exhaustion requirements. 
Ideally, all reporting mechanisms  would be available to all inmates; at a minimum, however, the 
proposed standard should require at least one alternate reporting mechanism to be fully 
accessible  to inmates with disabilities and LEP inmates .  
 
Recommendation : Only allow inmate translators in adult facilities in “exigent 
circumstances and with the expressed voluntary consent of the inmate victim .” In  
§ 115.315(a), never allow resident translators to be used in juvenile facilities.  
 
Unlike the Commission‘s recommendation, the proposed standa rd allows for inmate translators 
in exigent circumstances. There may be instances in which  an inmate translator is the only, and 
best, available option. However, inmate translators should only be used upon the expressed 
voluntary consent of the complaining  inmate.  
 
Translation is a sensitive task  that requires significant skills . The private information contained 
in a sexual abuse report is generally not appropriate  to share with other inmates; the lack of a 
professional translator who speaks the inmate‘s language is not, on its own, sufficient grounds to  
justify a breach in confidentiality. Thus, an inmate translator must be subject to the same 
guidelines on confidentiality as the formal members of the investigative team.  
 
Moreover, inmate translators may not provide accurate translations – either intentionally in 
retaliation for the abuse reported or inadvertently because of limited language skills. There will 
inevitably be some level of interpretation on the part of the translator, particularly if the 
translator is not a trained professional. Additionally, there is a strong likelihood that inmate 
survivors and witnesses will self -censor if the translator is another inmate – due to fear of 
retaliation and further victimization, the survivor or witness many not wish to disclose 
information about abuse  to other inmates . 
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 37 If a professional translator is not available, then the victimized inmate is in the best position to 
assess the likelihood of retaliation and his or her own level of  English fluency in order t o 
determine whether an inmate translator is a good option. In juvenile facilities, resident translators 
should never be allowed: beyond the heightened concerns about sharing sensitive information 
among youth in the facility, the likelihood of inaccurate tr anslations is simply too great .  
 
Question 17 : Should the final rule include a requirement that inmates with disabilities 
and LEP inmates be able to communicate with staff throughout the entire investigation 
and response process? If such a requirement is i ncluded, how should agencies ensure 
communication throughout the process?   
 
Recommendation : Add the following paragraph to the standard on accommodating 
inmates with special needs:  
(c) The agency shall make accommodations to ensure that inmates who are lim ited 
English proficient, deaf, or have a disability can communicate with facility staff and 
supportive service providers throughout the investigative process, when requesting 
and receiving medical and mental health care, and during the provision of other 
services that may be necessary after an inmate is victimized or witnesses an abusive 
event. Agencies shall make such accommodations by utilizing bilingual staff, 
providing translation by qualified interpreters, entering into agreements with 
community servic e providers with capabilities in or services to residents with 
disabilities, or by other means.  
 
Without effective means to communicate with staff during the investigations and response 
process es, inmates who are LEP, deaf or have a disability will not be able to access lifesaving 
support services that respond to their changing needs in the weeks and months after an assault. 
Moreover, they will be less effective witnesses, decreasing the likelihood that perpetrators are 
held accountable. Further, inmates wh o are LEP, deaf or have a disability will have less reason to 
trust the se process es, as they will lack any assurance that their complaints are being handled 
swiftly and comprehensively. Staff and inmate perpetrators disproportionately target individuals 
who are unlikely to report or have their reports credited. By failing to ensure that survivors with 
disabilities or LEP are engaged to the same extent as other victimized inmates, the Department in 
effect make s these individuals more vulnerable  to abuse .  
 
The costs for providing these accommodations should be minimal, particularly relative to the 
tremendous benefits for these highly vulnerable  inmates . As discussed below (with proposed   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 38 Standard § 115.22/222/322), memoranda of understanding with agencies that  serve LEP inmates 
can ensure professional translation without diverting corrections staff resources. Moreover, many 
state and county systems have access to language translation phone services,55 but often fail to 
train officers sufficiently on how to use them. Providing key staff with information about how to 
access these services is a low -cost, high -gain way of ensuring that all inmates can communicate 
effectively throughout the reporting, investigation , and response processes.  
 
§ 115.16/116/216/316 Hirin g and promotion decisions  
 
Recommendation : Amend paragraph (a) as follows:  
The agency shall not hire or promote anyone who has engaged in sexual abuse or 
sexual harassment  in an institutional setting; who has been convicted of engaging 
in sexual activity i n the community facilitated by force, the threat of force, or 
coercion  or has otherwise been adjudicated, including civilly or administratively,  as 
having engaged in sexual abuse ; or  who has been the subject of a civil protection 
order or protection from abuse order granted on the basis of  such activity; or who 
has been convicted of domestic violence or stalking . 
 
Domestic violence, stalking, and sexual abuse convictions and adjudications provide useful 
information regarding a staff member‘s history of or  propensity to engage in sexual abuse. The 
Department‘s 2000 survey of violence against women concluded that domestic violence ―is often 
accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior‖ and that battering ―is often part 
of a systematic pattern of dominance and control.‖56 The connection between these behaviors 
and further abuse is particularly well -established in the juvenile context: studies have found that 
between 30 and 60 percent of men who batter their partners also abuse their children.57 
Moreover, sexual abuse adjudications of any kind (not just those involving use of force or 
coercion ) and the imposition of civil protective orders should serve as a clear red flag for 
agencies charged with ensuring the safety of others.

Recommendation : Req uire background checks whenever a staff member is considered 
for a promotion . 
 
The proposed standard correctly puts parameters on who can be promoted based on past 
behavior, but does not require criminal background checks when individuals are being 
conside red for promotion. Promotions are intended to reward leadership, work performance , and 
professional behavior of individuals who set a worthy example for more junior staff. Agencies 
must make every effort to avoid promoting individuals found to have engaged  in abusive 
behavior.  
 
§ 115.17/117/217/317 Upgrades to facilities and technologies  
As noted above (with § 115.13/113/213/313), this new provision will improve the ability of 
agency administrators to maintain adequate supervision, and remain current with technological 
advancements. JDI commends the Department for adding this standard.  
 
III. Response Planning  
§ 115.21/ 121/221/321  Evidence protocol and forensic medical exams  
In general, JDI applauds the Department for retaining key provisions  from the Commi ssion‘s 
recommendations  in its evidence protocol and forensic exams standard – including ensuring that 
these exams are performed by a qualified medical practitioner, free of charge – and for 
strengthening this provision to provide for exams whenever ―evide ntiarily or medically 
appropriate.‖  
 
Recommendation : To ensure that pre -pubescen t youth receive an appropriate exam, 
modify § 115.321(b) as follows:  
(b) The protocol shall be developmentally appropriate for all youth – providing for a 
pediatric examinatio n for female victims who have not experienced the onset of 
menarche and for male victims who have not yet reached puberty, and a medical 
forensic examination in accordance with adapted from or otherwise based on  the 
2004 U.S. Department of Justice’s Office  on Violence Against Women publication 
“A National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, 
Adults/Adolescents,” subsequent updated editions, or similarly comprehensive and 
authoritative protocols developed after 2010 for youth who have r eached puberty . 
The protocol shall detail policies and procedures for mandatory reporting, consent   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice

 40 to treatment, parental notification, and scope of confidentiality in accordance with 
applicable laws.  
 
For adults and adolescents, the Department‘s National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical 
Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents  is recognized as the definitive guide to conducting 
forensic exams. At the time of this writing, that protocol is being revised and a protocol for 
confinement facilities is being  created. All corrections agencies should be encouraged to 
familiarize themselves with the new protocol once it is finalized.  
 
However, this protocol was not intended to be used when examining pre -pubescent youth. As 
noted in the National Protocol , it does  not address the legal issues regarding child sexual abuse, 
mandatory reporting, a child‘s ability to consent to medical treatment and evidence collection 
without parental/guardian involvement, and the scope of confidentiality afforded to 
minors.58Abused ch ildren require a pediatric exam, which is not addressed in the National 
Protocol . Currently, there is no national protocol appropriate for use with children, and JDI urges 
the Department to develop one. In the interim, several jurisdictions have protocols that 
appropriately address the legal and developmental issues unique to forensic examinations of 
children .  
 
Recommendation : Require facilities to enter into cooperative agreements with 
community sexual assault response team s (SART s), and allow facility st aff to conduct 
the examinations  only as a last resort, by amending paragraph (c) as follows:  
(c) The agency shall offer all victims of sexual abuse access to forensic medical 
exams performed by qualified medical practitioners, whether onsite or at an outsi de 
facility,  without financial cost, where evidentiarily and medically appropriate. 
Agencies shall enter into cooperative agreements with community sexual assault 
response team s (SART s), and when a local SART is not available, explore other 
options such as  contracting with a mobile SART . Agencies shall c onduct 
examinations with facility medical personnel only as a last resort.  
  
The community Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) model, in which  a multidisciplinary 
team meets at a designated , fully equipped site to conduct interviews and complete the sexual 
assault forensic exam, is an established best practice across the country. Every state has a sexual

 41 assault  coalition or organizing body or state agency that supervises and funds the state's sexual 
assault  response that could provide an agency with information about how to locate local service 
providers.  
 
In most cases, joining the community SART and utilizing the community SART facilities will be 
the most efficient and cost -effective option for corrections  agencies. Beyond minimizing in -
house costs for forensic examinations and ensuring that corrections staff maintain proper training 
and certification, partnering with an experienced community SART will: provide increased 
expertise and access to the most rec ent developments in the field; improve the quality of care 
offered; eliminate potential concerns regarding conflicts of interest for facility staff; and increase 
the likelihood of successful prosecution s.  
 
Some communities do not have a functioning SART, and some facilities may be located a 
prohibitive distance from the nearest  certified site. In such cases, having  community 
organizations come into the facility to conduct medical examinations, interviews, and crisis 
counseling and advocacy may be the secon d best option. I n such cases,  facilit ies must be 
prepared to: provide an examination room that is private, available on demand, can be sterilized 
to prevent cross contamination of evidence, and is large enough to accommodate the forensic 
nurse, advocate, a nd survivor; clear community personnel in advance for entry into the facility 
and facilitate their getting to the examination room in a timely manner; and enter into contracts 
with Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner s (SANE s) or Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners  (SAFEs) 
and rape crisis programs to provide this service on -site.  
 
If there is no opportunity to make use of either  an off -site or  a mobile SART, allowing facility 
medical staff members to conduct sexual assault examinations should be permitted as a last  
resort  only. However , the lack of transparency, challenges of maintaining certified staff, and 
chilling effect involving facility staff would have on reporting are contrary to the spirit of the 
standards and far outweigh the benefits when other options ar e available. As discussed further 
with the specialized training provision for medical and mental health care  
(§ 115.35/135/235/335), if staff are charged to perform these duties, they should undergo the 
same level of training that is required of forensic examiners in the community, in accordance   Just Detention International

Examiners .59  
 
Recommendation : Require that outside victim advocates be used, and only allow 
properly screened and trained agency  staff members to serve in this role when 
community advocates are unavailable, by amending paragraph (d) as follows:  
(d)  The agency shall make available to the victim qualified staff member or a victim 
advocate from a community -based organization that pro vides services to sexual 
abuse victims. If a community -based organization is not able to provide victim 
advocate services, the agency shall make qualified staff members who have been 
screened and trained in accordance with community standards available to provide 
these services.  
 
Outside victim advocates serve a vital role in the investigation and response process , which is 
significantly weakened when they are replaced by a corrections staff member. Victimized 
inmates may have legitimate concerns of retali ation and other reasons not to trust a staff member 
advocate, particularly if the designated staff member and/or the staff members‘ colleagues 
participated or acquiesced in the assault. They also may not understand the limits to 
confidentiality when speaki ng with an agency staff member.  
 
Even the most well -qualified, committed staff members work within the agency and, particularly 
if they are sworn officers, will inevitably experience a conflict between their security obligation 
to respond to all disciplin ary violations and the requirement to retain certain information 
confidentially in their victim advocate role. Staff members also are not likely to be able to spend 
sufficient time with an inmate before, during, and after the lengthy (and intrusive) medica l 
forensic examination process while still performing other required duties. Reliance on staff 
member advocates further may not ensure that there is the necessary 24 -hour coverage of this 
role. 
 
Moreover, allowing a staff member to provide this crucial ser vice is inconsistent with proposed 
Standard § 115.22/222/322, which requires agencies to ―maintain or attempt to enter into 
memoranda of understanding or other agreements with community service providers that are able

 43 to provide inmates with confidential e motional support services related to sexual abuse.‖ If 
agencies are allowed to assign a staff member to provide support services, agencies will have 
little incentive to form these agreements with outside organizations, making it even less likely 
that incar cerated victims will have access to appropriate services.  
 
As with community SART s, some facilities may be in areas where there are no available rape 
crisis agencies, and in those locations, having a qualified staff member available to provide 
support serv ices may be the best option. However, staff should be allowed to serve this role only 
as a last resort, in locations where the agency is unable to develop an agreement with a 
community -based agency that would cover these services in accordance with standar d  
§ 115.22/222/322.  
 
The Department‘s requirements for a staff member to be qualified are wholly inadequate for 
providing support services to a victim of sexual abuse. Serving as a victim advocate is a 
specialized skill that requires training, screening,  and sensitivity. Agencies must ensure that staff 
members chosen for this important role are carefully screened, to ensure that they are not likely 
to be perpetrators of abuse, that they will interact in a professional manner that is respectful of 
inmates regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, and that they are emotionally 
prepared to provide support in this very demanding context. The Department details no 
requirements for qualification, except for estimating that an eight -hour training cours e would be 
needed.60 Most community -based agencies require that advocates receive a minimum of 40 hours 
of training. Staff members should not be considered qualified until they have completed training 
similar to that required for advocates in the community.  
 
Recommendation:  Require agencies to document their efforts to collaborate with 
outside service providers by replacing paragraph (h) with the following:  
(h) Agencies shall document their efforts to secure services from a community -based 
organization. If r elying on staff members to serve as victim advocates, the agency 
shall also document that sufficient screening and training were provided to establish 
that staff are qualified to perform this role.

 44 Agencies should be required to collaborate with community  providers in conducting forensic 
examinations and serving as victim advocates, and only be allowed to rely on facility staff to 
perform these sensitive and skilled functions when outside providers are not available. To ensure 
that this requirement can be monitored, the Department should require documentation 
establishing the agency‘s efforts to enter into relevant agreements and, if agency staff members 
are used, showing that they have been properly screened and trained, and are available to provide 
suffic ient round -the-clock coverage.  
 
Question 18 : Do the standards adequately provide support for victims of sexual abuse in 
lockups upon transfer to other facilities, and if not, how should the standards be 
modified?  
 
The evidence protocol and forensic exam pr ovision for lockups ( § 115.121) do not provide for a 
victim advocate to be part of the investigation and response process. Nor are lockups required 
even to attempt to enter into agreements with outside public entities and community service 
providers, despi te the fact that many law enforcement entities with lockups already have such 
agreements for investigating sex crimes in the community. These services play an important role 
regardless of where an assault occurs. The Department should restore these provisi ons to the 
lockups standards , as the Commission had recommended . 
 
Recommendation : Require lockups to provide an outside victim advocate , just  as other 
facilities  are required to do . 
 
Victims need and deserve an advocate during the investigation process reg ardless of where they 
are held. Lockups should be required to provide the same range of services as other types of 
facilities. Notably, a s lockups are often run by sheriffs ‘ and police departments, they should be 
able to utilize the same resources for this  purpose that they employ in other sex -crime cases. 
Thus, at a minimum, the proposed standard should require lockups to provide for an outside 
victim advocate whenever one can be made available. Lockups should be required to establish 
memoranda of understa nding with outside service providers, when possible. At a minimum, the 
proposed standard should require larger law enforcement agenc ies that have lockup facilities  to 
modify their contracts and agreements with providers who serve on community response team s 
to ensure that victims in lockups receive their services.  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 45 Victims who report abuse after they have been transferred to another facility should be afforded 
access to the same protections and services that are required when the report is made at the site  
of the abuse. Such a practice should be explicitly incorporated into the standards, whether the 
transfer is intra -agency ( e.g. from one prison to another prison in the same state) or between 
agencies (e. g. from lockup to jail; from jail to prison; from prison to community corrections).  
 
§ 115.22/222/322 Agreements with outside public entities and community service providers  
Collaborating with outside entities and service providers is a low or no -cost way for facilities to : 
maximize their use of limited per sonnel and resources ; dramatically enhance their relevant 
expertise ; encourage the sharing of information that is not likely to be disclosed to officials ; 
ensure that they are providing victim -centered care that is similar to what is available in the 
commu nity; and provide accountability and integrity to the process. While the Department 
recognizes the value of corrections -community partnerships, the standards should be stronger in 
requiring these relationships.  
 
Recommendation : Only allow for an internal, operationally independent entity to serve 
as the outside reporting mechanism when there is no outside entity available, by 
modifying paragraph (a) as follows:  
The agency shall maintain or attempt to enter into memoranda of understanding or 
other agreements  with an outside public entity or office that is able to receive and 
immediately forward inmate reports of sexual abuse and sexual harassment to 
agency officials pursuant to § 115.51 . If no outside entity is available, unless  the 
agency shall  enable s inmat es to make such reports to an internal entity that is 
operationally independent from the agency’s chain of command ….  
 
With respect to reporting entities, the proposed standard allows for agencies to forgo even 
attempting to establish an agreement with an outside entity if it ―enables inmates to make reports 
to an internal entity that is operationally independent from the agency‘s chain of comment.‖61 
This is very problematic. Regardless of how officials view internal entities, inmates are unlikely 
to unders tand or trust the distinction between an operationally independent entity and a more 
traditionally internal one. A reporting entity that answers to the same agency head will be seen as 
part of the system that failed to protect the inmate in the first place . This perception is legitimate;

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 46 internal entities  are rarely  as effective in detecting and responding to sexual abuse  as, for 
example, outside inspector general offices .62 
 
Recommendation : Require lockups to attempt to enter into agreements with outside 
service providers, or to modify current agreements with community providers, by 
applying § 115.22(b) and (c) to § 115.122.  
 
As discussed above, lockups should be required to enter into agreements with outside service 
providers.63 At a minimum, law enforcement  entities that run lockups should be required to 
modify any agreements they have  with community providers to respond to sexual assaults in the 
community, so that survivors of sexual violence in lockups receive the same coordinated 
response.  
 
Recommendation : Add sexual harassment to § 155.22/222/322 (b).  
 
Sexual harassment is often a precursor to sexually abusive behavior, particularly if it remains 
unchecked. Community service providers are skilled in assisting individuals who are facing a 
broad range of un wanted sexual activity. When an inmate is sexually harassed, confidential 
emotional support services may provide him or her with the information and safety -planning 
tools necessary to end harassment before it escalates into sexual abuse.  
 
Question 19 : Sho uld this standard expressly mandate that agencies attempt to enter into 
memoranda of understanding that provide specific assistance for LEP inmates?  
 
Recommendation : Add the following paragraph to this standard:  
Agencies shall maintain or attempt to enter into memoranda of understanding for 
assistance in communicating with LEP inmates in languages commonly spoken 
within the facility.  
 
                                                 
62 In this context, the Department‘s Office of the Inspector General would be considered wholly independent, 
becau se it does not report directly to the head of the Bureau of Prisons. The Attorney General, who oversees both 
entities, is analogous to a state governor, who would likewise have the ultimate authority over the state corrections 
department and a public overs ight entity.  
63 While ideally all agencies would collaborate with an outside reporting entity, given the short period of time that 
individuals generally spend in lockups, the cost of establishing an outside reporting entity may outweigh the benefits 
of doi ng so. People are generally in lockups only for a matter of hours. As a result, someone victimized in a lockup 
facility should be able to report to another entity within the same day (or at least within the 96 hour time period that 
generally would allow fo r a forensic exam).    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 47 As discussed above ( addressing  standard § 115.15/115/215/315), all inmates need to have 
effective means of communication thr oughout the reporting, investigation, and response 
processes. Reliance on inmate translators for LEP inmates is an ineffective and dangerous 
practice. Agencies should be required to secure professional translation services for the full range 
of languages p resent at the facility. In facilities with a large number of LEP inmates who speak 
the same language, efforts should also be made to enter into agreements with agencies that can 
provide assistance directly in those languages. As with the other provisions i n this proposed 
standard, JDI recommends that the Department require documentation of these efforts.  
 
§ 115.23/123/223/323 Policies to ensure investigations of allegations  
 
Recommendation : Ensure that multiple investigations pertaining to the same inciden t 
of sexual abuse are coordinated by adding the following provision:  
The agency shall coordinate internal investigations of alleged sexual abuse and 
sexual harassment with any external investigations by law enforcement, child 
protective services, or other entities  charged with investigating alleged abuse. The 
agency shall establish an understanding between investigative bodies with 
overlapping responsibilities  so that staff have a clear understanding of their roles in 
evidence collection, interviewing, taki ng statements, preserving crime scenes, and 
other investigative responsibilities that require clarification.  
 
Beyond identifying the entity with the legal authority to conduct criminal investigations of 
sexual misconduct, the agency must ensure that crimin al and administrative investigations each 
occur  in a timely manner , and that they are coordinated. When the victim is a minor, whether in a 
juvenile or adult facility, allegations of sexual abuse may also trigger a child abuse investigation 
by a state or l ocal entity. Without clearly defined roles and procedures, internal investigations are 
often unduly delayed, child abuse allegations are not always investigated, and one entity‘s 
approach to the collection of evidence or statements can hinder another entit y‘s investigation. 
The standard should require that facilities establish clear responsibilities when overlapping 
investigations occur, so that staff members understand the actions they should take and on which 
they can collaborate with other agencies to en sure timely resolution of all investigations. This 
type of coordination is essential to ensur ing full and timely investigation s of alleged misconduct.  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 48 Recommendation : Add sexual harassment to paragraphs (c) and (d).  
 
Paragraph (a) appropriately requires that allegations of both sexual abuse and sexual harassment 
be investigated. As a result, state entities and Department of Justice components conducting 
administrative investigations should ensure that their policies encompass sexual harassment as 
well as sexual abuse.  
 
IV. Training and Education  
§ 115.31/131/231/331 Employee training  
 
Recommendation : Add the following topics to employee training, paragraph (a):  
how to handle disclosures of victimization  sensitively ; and   
how to distinguish consensual/vol untary sexual activity between inmates from 
sexual abuse . 
 
JDI applauds the Department for recognizing the vital importance of sufficient staff training on 
critical topics, such as how to maintain appropriate professional boundaries and how to 
communicate effectively and professionally with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex 
inmates. However, some additional training topics are warranted. These areas directly respond to 
issues identified in the BJS surveys, namely , that a large percentage  of all abuse is committed by 
staff of the opposite sex  to those victimized , without force, and that LGBTI inmates are 
disproportionately targeted for abuse.  
 
The proposed standards properly empower all staff to receive reports of sexual abuse and, as a 
result , all staff must learn how to respond appropriately. Information about sexual abuse must be 
shared discretely and professionally, to protect victim s as well as the integrity of investigation s.  
 
The Department correctly recognizes that there is a differenc e between sexual abuse and 
consensual sexual activity between inmates. However, employees need to be educated about  how 
to make this distinction. Coercion tactics can be subtle, making it difficult to recognize when an 
inmate is being forced, pressured or threatened into engaging in sexual activity. ―Protective 
pairing‖ – in which an inmate provides sex in exchange for protection from other inmates – is 
exceptionally common in confinement settings and on the surface often appears consensual when   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 49 it is in fa ct exploitive and abusive. Staff members need to learn about these dynamics so that they 
can distinguish between consensual activity and abusive behavior.  
 
Recommendation : Amend paragraph (a)(9) to require training on : 
How to communicate  effectively and pr ofessionally with inmates, including lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex , or gender non -conforming  inmates.  
 
Individuals who do not self -identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex (LGBTI) 
but are gender non -conforming in appea rance and/or mannerisms are often perceived by others 
as LGBTI and are frequently targe ts of sexual abuse. Staff training on effective and professional 
communication with gender non -conforming inmates will encourage greater reporting and help 
decrease the levels of harassment and abuse that these vulnerable individuals endure.  
 
Recommendation : Add sexual harassment to paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5).  
 
As noted in the recommendation for § 115.22/222/322 (b), sexual harassment is often a precursor 
to sexual abus e. Therefore, it is important to include sexual harassment in all relevant areas of 
employee training. In addition to the zero -tolerance policy and the right  of all people  to be free 
from abuse and harassment, staff should be informed about the dynamics of  sexual harassment, 
particularly as it relates to sexual abuse, and that retaliation based on reports of sexual 
harassment is prohibited.  
 
Recommendation : Add the following provision to ensure that all staff members receive 
basic information about sexual a buse in detention:  
Agency employees who do not have contact with inmates shall receive information 
about the agency’s zero -tolerance policy, employee reporting options, and the 
prohibition on retaliation.  
 
Though agency employees who do not have contact wi th inmates do not need full training about 
PREA, they should still receive basic information about sexual violence in detention. 
Specifically, all employees should receive information about the agency‘s zero -tolerance policy 
regarding sexual abuse so they understand that the agency -- in all of its functions -- will not 
tolerate sexual abuse and sexual harassment. All employees also need to understand reporting 
options (in some instances non -contact employees may be made aware of sexual abuse) and the 
prohi bition on retaliation. This basic information will engage all employees, even those who do   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 50 not come into regular contact with inmates, in the agency‘s commitment to addressing sexual 
abuse.  
 
Question 20 : Should the Department further specify training requi rements for lockups 
and if so, how? Would lockups be able to implement such training in a cost -effective 
manner via in -person training, videos, or web -based seminars?  
 
Recommendation : Amend § 115.131( a) as follows:  
The agency shall train all employees and volunteers who may have contact with 
lockup detainees to be able to fulfill their responsibilities under agency sexual abuse 
prevention, detection, and response policies and procedures, including : the agency’s 
zero-tolerance policy; inmates’ right to be fr ee from sexual abuse and sexual 
harassment; the dynamics of sexual abuse and harassment in confinement settings, 
including which inmates are most vulnerable in lockup settings; the right of inmates 
and employees to be free from retaliation for reporting se xual abuse or harassment; 
how to detect and respond to signs of threatened and actual abuse ; and how to 
communicate effectively and professionally with all detainees.   
 
The lockup standard should specify topics that must be included in employee training. I n order 
for training about how to ―fulfill [employees‘] responsibilities‖ and ―communicate effectively 
and professionally‖ to be meaningful, lockup employees and volunteers must receive training on : 
the agency‘s zero -tolerance policy; inmates‘ right to be free from sexual abuse and sexual 
harassment; the dynamics of sexual abuse and harassment in confinement settings, including 
which inmates are most vulnerable in lockup settings; the right of inmates and employees to be 
free from retaliation for reporting sexual abuse or harassment; and how to detect and respond to 
signs of threatened and actual abuse. Given the prevalence of staff sexual misconduct in 
detention settings generally, training on professional boundaries should also be  required . 
 
Since the prop osed standard already requires that lockup employees receive training on agency 
policies, adding the topics detailed above should not add a significant amount of training time or 
expense.64 The minimal amount of additional training time would be outweighed by the 
substantial benefit of ensuring that employees understand  which lockup inmates may be the most 
vulnerable to sexual abuse and how to prevent and respond to potential abuse.  
                                                 
64 The National Institute of Corrections training ―Your Role: Responding to Sexual Abuse ,‖ available on -line at 
http://nicic.gov/Training/PREA , is a free, two -hour online training designed to enhance corrections professionals‘ 
skills in responding to allegations of sexual abuse. One portion of this training involves a review of the dynamics of 
sexual violence in confinement and could be used to provide training to lockup employees .    Just Detention International

 51 § 115.32/232/332 Volunteer and contractor training  
 
Recommendation : Modify paragraph (a) to ensure that “all volunteers and contractors 
who have substantial contact with inmates have been trained in accordance with the 
employee training ” and modify paragraph (b) such that “all volunteers and contractors 
who have contact with inma tes shall be notified of the agency’s zero -tolerance policy 
regarding sexual abuse and sexual harassment and informed how to report abuse.”  
 
In some agencies, contractors and volunteers serve essential corrections functions with 
substantial inmate contact.  Contracted medical and mental health personnel, religious leaders, 
and work supervisors, for example, are at least as likely to receive disclosures about sexual abuse 
as corrections staff, and face similar issues with respect to professional boundaries. T hus, these 
individuals should receive the full training required for employees who have contact with 
inmates.  Additionally, all volunteers and contractors – even those who do not have contact with 
inmates – should be informed about the agency‘s zero -tolera nce policy and the right to be free 
from retaliation for reporting sexual abuse.  
 
§ 115.33/233/333 Inmate/resident education  
 
Recommendation : Require that sexual violence education be accessible to all inmates 
and residents.  
 
A basic tool for preventing an d responding to sexual abuse is to educate inmates about sexual 
violence. Sadly, a significant number of individuals in confinement settings have experienced 
past sexual or physical abuse, neglect or marginalization. Some inmates have been so 
traumatized f rom past experiences that they may not fully understand their right to bodily 
integrity and safety. Many individuals, especially those first entering detention, have an 
expectation that sexual abuse is an inevitable part of life behind bars. As such, it is  imperative 
that all inmates and residents receive clear, age -appropriate, and understandable  education about 
sexual violence.  
 
Inmate education should be appropriate not just with regard to  age, but also  to cognitive level. 
The language used in adult inm ate education sessions and printed materials should be at a fifth -
grade reading level, and material for youth should be age -appropriate. Agencies should also be   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 52 required to ensure that inmates and residents with cognitive disabilities, limited literacy ski lls, 
limited English proficiency or other challenges receive and understand the information provided.  
 
JDI suggests that agencies be encouraged to work with outside professionals who can advise 
them about the development of appropriate and accessible infor mation.JDI also recommends that 
the PREA Resource Center be tasked with developing accessible materials that can be used by 
agencies for inmate  and resident education.  
 
§ 113.34/134/234/334 Specialized training: investigations  
 
Recommendation : Require inve stigative staff to receive training on how to access and 
use available translation services.  
 
As discussed previously (in § 115.15/115/215/315 and § 115.22/222/322) , ensuring that LEP 
inmates have sufficient means to communicate throughout the investigati on process is critical. 
Ideally, each facility would have investigators who are fluent in the languages spoken by 
inmates. However, there will inevitably be times when the investigator assigned to a sexual 
abuse allegation does not speak the language of a victim or witness. Per § 115.22/222/322, 
facilities should enter into agreements with translation services for such these occasions. Such 
agreements are only effective, however, if investigative staff know how to access the services. 
Providing this basic i nformation is a low -cost, high -gain way of ensuring that all inmates are able 
to communicate throughout the reporting, investigation , and response process es.  
 
Recommendation : In prisons, jails, lockups, and community confinement facilities, 
amend paragrap h (b) to include guidance on determining whether sexual activity 
between inmates is consensual . In juvenile facilities, require investigators to receive 
guidance on how to apply age of consent laws to distinguish between sexual abuse and 
voluntary sexual c ontact between similarly aged residents.   
 
In its definition of sexual abuse, the Department appropriately made clear  that consensual sexual 
conduct between inmates does not constitute sexual abuse. To ensure that this translates into 
appropriate practice s, investigators should be trained on how to distinguish between consensual 
sexual activity between inmates and sexual abuse. The current standard requires facility staff to 
report any suspicion of sexual abuse, leaving it to investigators to determine whet her the conduct   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 53 constituted sexual abuse for purposes of PREA -mandated responses. Providing investigators 
with appropriate training will help ensure that PREA is properly invoked to prevent and respond 
to the serious harms and trauma of sexual abuse, and t hat abuse is not minimized or mistaken for 
consensual activity. This training will also lessen the frequency with which LGBTI and other 
inmates who engage in consensual sexual activity are labeled as perpetrators of sexual abuse and 
penalized as a result.  
 
In juvenile facilities, investigators should  also receive specialized training on age of consent laws 
to ensure a thorough understanding of the limited circumstances under which juvenile facilities 
can treat voluntary sexual contact between residents as abuse, in order to prevent facilities from 
using PREA to target LGBTI and other youth for engaging in voluntary sexual contact with 
similarly aged residents. Many residents of juvenile facilities are old enough to consent to sexual 
activity with other simi larly aged youth. 65 With a solid understanding of age of consent laws, 
investigators will be less likely to apply the standards incorrectly to voluntary sexual contact 
between minors who, under the laws of that state, can legally consent to engage in such contact.  
 
§ 115.35/235/335 Specialized training: medical and mental health care  
 
Recommendation :  Amend paragraph (a) to include : 
In addition to the general training provided to all employees pursuant to § 115.31 , 
the agency shall ensure that...  
 
Whether employed directly by the corrections agency or through a contracted provider, medical 
and mental health staff ha s extensive contact with inmates . As such , they are among the most 
likely to receive reports of abuse -- and they may also perpetrate abuse. Sim ilar to investigative 
staff, all medical and mental health professionals need to receive the full employee training, as 
well as specialized information appropriate for their field.  
                                                 
65 In mos t states the age of consent is 16, and in more than half of states, minors 14 or older can consent to sexual 
contact with others who are close to them in age. In addition, some facilities house residents as old as 25. See ASAPH

Recommendation : Modify paragraph (b) to read:  
If medical staff employed by the agency conduct forensic examinations, such 
medical staff shall receive the appropriate  training  that meets or exceeds the 
recommendations in the Department of Justice’s National Training Standards for 
Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners  to con duct such examinations .  
 
As discussed above (with § 115.21/121/221/321), forensic examinations should only be 
performed by facility medical staff as a last resort. Corrections a gencies are not likely to have  
sufficient  in-house expertise to provide  the hi gh-level, comprehensive medical education needed 
to qualify facility medical staff to conduct a medical forensic exam. When medical staff 
employed by the agency are charged with performing these duties, they need the same level of 
training and qualificatio ns as community -based sexual assault forensic examiners (SAFE s). To 
meet this standard, the Department should require that the training provided to medical staff 
conducting forensic examinations meet s or exceed s the recommendations found in the 
Department‘ s National Training Standards for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners .66 
 
The National Training Standards for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners is a 
companion to the National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations: 
Adults/Ad olescents , which the Department already relies upon for evidence protocol and forensic 
medical examinations.67 The t raining standards  offer a framework for the specialized education 
necessary to ensure that providers conducting forensic examinations are abl e to validate and 
address victims‘ health concerns, minimize their trauma, promote their healing, and maximize 
the detection, collection, preservation, and documentation of physical evidence related to the 
assault.  
 
V. Screening for Risk of Sexual Victimi zation and Abusiveness  
§ 115.41/241 Screening for risk of victimization and abusiveness  
§ 115.341 Obtaining information from residents  
 
JDI commends the Department for insisting that  the full range of known vulnerability factors be 
considered in screenings  of all inmates and residents – including those in women‘s prisons and

Examiners , supra  note 59.

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 55 jails and in juvenile facilities. Many of the factors that make someone especially vulnerable to 
sexual abuse behind bars are known. While most  research on the question has been conduct ed in 
men‘s prisons, the same characteristics are known to place someone at risk in facilities for 
women and girls. An individual‘s self -perception of vulnerability is likewise as important a 
consideration in juvenile facilities as it is in adult instituti ons. The Department‘s application of 
these key risk factors to all inmates and residents is an important improvement  to the standards .  
 
The explicit prohibition on punishing an inmate for failing to disclose this sensitive information 
is also essential. V ulnerable inmates – particularly LGBTI inmates – are understandably 
apprehensive about revealing information that might place them at heightened risk for abuse. 
Pressuring inmates to answer screening questions related to their identity or past victimizatio n, 
and then punishing them if they refuse to provide such information, would further undermine 
trust between inmates and corrections staff, making it more difficult for inmates to report abuse .  
 
Recommendation : To ensure that individuals perceived as LGBT I are adequately 
protected, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity, amend  
§ 115.41/241(c)(7) as follows:  
 “Whether the inmate is gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender , or intersex , or gender 
non-conforming.”   
and amend § 115.341 (c)(2) a s follows:  
“Sexual orientation, transgender or intersex status , or gender non -conformance.”  
 
Inmates and residents who are gender non -conforming are often targeted for sexual abuse and 
harassment based solely on the fact that other inmates or staff perceiv e them to be LGBTI, 
regardless of how they self-identify. As a result, gender non -conforming individuals are at just as 
high risk of sexual abuse as LGBTI inmates and residents. Including gender non -conformance as 
one of the screening criteria for risk of sexual victimization will help ensure that inmates and 
residents who are vulnerable to sexual abuse because they are perceived to be LGBTI are 
adequately protected.  
 
Recommendation : In light of the lack of a validated screening instrument for juvenile 
facilities, modify § 115.341(b) to require the use of a standardized information 
gathering tool . 
    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 56 The current standard instructs agencies to attempt to gather  a host of different information about 
youth during the intake process using ―an objective screening instrument.‖ However, among 
professionals familiar with assessment and screening, the term ―objective screening instrument‖ 
means a tool that has been validated and that differentiates between different levels of risk of 
being victimized or engaging in sex ual abuse. While youth should be asked a standardized set of 
questions during the intake process, JDI (and the juvenile experts with whom it collaborates) 
know of no validated objective screening instrument that assesses a resident‘s risk of 
victimization or abusive behavior.  
 
Recommendation : Amend § 115.341(d) as follows:  
 This information shall be ascertained through conversations with residents during 
the intake process and medical and mental health screenings; during classification 
assessments; and by reviewing court records, case files, facility behavioral records, 
and other relevant documentation from the residents’ files. In facilities where 
medical and mental health practitioners conduct medical and mental health 
screenings during the intake process , these practitioners, and not other facility staff, 
should ask residents information about their sexual orientation or gender identity, 
prior sexual victimization, mental health status, intersex condition, and  mental or 
physical disabilities . 
 
As current ly drafted, the proposed standards allows intake and security staff to gather 
information about sensitive issues from residents, regardless of whether these staff have the 
appropriate level of training to do so effectively, safely , and respectfully. Only s ufficiently 
trained professionals should be asking residents such sensitive questions, both to increase the 
likelihood that residents will share this important information and to decrease the risk that they 
will be traumatized in the process. Medical and m ental health practitioners are in the best 
position to gather this information while conducting health assessments during the intake and 
classification process.  
 
Question 21 : Recognizing that lockup detention is usually measured in hours, and that 
lockups  often have limited placement options, should the final rule mandate rudimentary 
screening requirements for lockups, and if so, in what form?  
 
Recommendation:  Add the following provision as § 115.141:  
(a) Before detainees are placed together in a cell, the y must be screened to ensure 
that those at high risk of being sexually abused are not held with those who are 
likely to be sexually abusive.    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 57 (b) Facility staff shall make reasonable efforts to gather information about and 
consider, at a minimum, the follo wing criteria: (1) the age of the detainee, including 
whether the detainee is a juvenile; (2) the physical build of the detainee; (3) whether 
the detainee has a mental, physical, or developmental disability; (4) whether the 
detainee is gay, lesbian, bisexu al, transgender, intersex, or gender non -conforming; 
(5) the detainee’s criminal history; and (6) the detainee’s own perception of 
vulnerability.  
 
Sexual violence does not require days in detention to  occur . Indeed, i f a vulnerable inmate is left 
alone wi th a likely predator, abuse can occur quickly. To prevent  this, lockups should do basic 
screening to ensure that highly vulnerable inmates are not left alone with likely perpetrators  even 
for short periods of time. While a full classification process may n ot be necessary, lockups 
should be required to collect information similar to what the standards require longer -term 
facilit ies to gather, especially if lockups hold multiple inmates in the same cell. Indeed, many 
police lockups already employ basic measur es aimed at protecting inmates from sexual abuse.68 
The Department would be remiss if it did not require that police lockups employ at least a 
rudimentary screening.  
 
The shorter time that people generally spend  in lockups may justify a more liberal use of 
isolation than is appropriate in other types of facilities. As discussed below ( in § 115.43), JDI 
believes that segregation in prisons and jails needs to be curtailed beyond the limits in the 
Department‘s proposed  standards . However, in a lockup, keeping s omeone separated for a few 
hours may be the most effective solution and is unlikely to have the traumatizing impact that 
arises from extended isolation.  
 
Question 22 : Should the final rule provide greater guidance regarding the required scope 
of the intake  screening, and if so, how?  
 
The proposed standard encourages some consideration of the risk of victimization and 
abusiveness at the initial screening, but without additional guidance, agencies may not know how

 58 to comply with that provision  effectively . As discussed below, the intake screening should 
attempt to gather all of the information required for the initial classification.   
 
Recommendation:  Modify paragraphs (c) and (d) to each begin  
“The intake screening  and initial classification process shall co nsider…”  
 
The final rule should require agencies to attempt to gather all information related to risk of 
victimization and risk of abusiveness as early as the intake screening. Agencies need to have as 
much screening information as possible in order to mak e safe housing and bed decisions for an 
inmate‘s first days in the facility , since vulnerable inmates are often abused sexually soon after 
intake . Not all information may be immediately available, but the agency should attempt to 
gather this information as  expeditiously as possible. I nformation about an individual‘s physical 
build, age, gender non -conformance, criminal history, and immigration status should be readily 
available even at this early point, and factored into inmates‘ initial housing assignments . At a 
minimum, inmates should also be asked about their own perception of vulnerability, whether 
they identify as LGBTI, and whether they have a disability. While some vulnerable individuals 
may not feel comfortable answering these questions soon after ar riving at a facility,  many others 
will. In addition, the inclusion of these factors from the moment someone enters the facility will 
have a positive impact on the zero -tolerance culture.  
 
§ 115.42/242 Use of screening information  
 
JDI applauds the Departm ent‘s requirement  of an individualized assessment to determine 
whether a transgender or intersex inmate should be housed in a men‘s or women‘s facility. 
Transgender women, who tend to be housed in men‘s facilities in accordance with their birth 
gender and/ or genitalia, are unquestionably among the most vulnerable to sexual abuse.69 The 
standards for adult facilities recognize that, for many transgender and intersex individuals, 
housing in a facility aligned with their gender identity may be the safest and mo st appropriate 
option .

 59 On the other hand, JDI disagrees with  the Department‘s decision to allow housing determinations 
to be based solely on sexual orientation or gender identity. All too often , agencies that have 
housed LGBTI inmates based solely on the se factors have subjected them to punitive conditions, 
typically in isolation. Separate housing also encourages the misperception that LGBTI inmates 
are worthy of stigmatization . Furthermore, such separate housing tends inadvertently to house 
vulnerable an d predatory inmates together, by placing higher importance on LGBTI status . 
 
Recommendation : Prohibit agencies from relying exclusively on sexual orientation and 
gender identity to make housing determinations, by adding the following paragraph to 
this stan dard:  
“The agency shall not place l esbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex inmates 
in particular facilities, units, or wings solely on the basis of their sexual orientation, 
genital status, or gender identity, unless such placement is in a dedicate d facility, 
unit, or wing established in connection with a consent decree, legal settlement or 
judgment for the purpose of protecting inmates.”  
 
Determining safe housing for inmates requires consideration of the full range of relevant 
screening criteria. W hile sexual orientation and gender identity are strong vulnerability factors, 
LGBTI inmates need to be housed based on a full assessment of the ir risks. Even facilities with a 
large population of gay and transgender inmates have found that housing based  solely on this 
status is problematic . Both the San Francisco Sheriff‘s Department and the New York City 
Department of Correction have closed the ―gay unit‖ in their facilities in favor of a more 
comprehensive strategy for protecting vulnerable inmates, in pa rt due to concerns about security 
and abuse in these units. At Fluvanna Correctional Institution in Virginia – which the BJS 
identified as having the highest rate of inmate -on-inmate abuse for all prisons and jails and the 
second highest rate of staff sexu al misconduct among women‘s prisons70 – the previous warden 
had purportedly established a ―butch ward,‖ where women who identified as or were perceived 
to be lesbian or gender non -conforming were subject to ongoing harassment and punitive 
conditions.71 
 
If the Department seeks to preserve the ―K6G unit‖ at the Men‘s County Jail of the Los Angeles 
Sheriff‘s Department, it can do so while still protecting against the likelihood that other agencies

 60 will segregate LGBTI inmates or otherwise place them unnecessari ly in punitive conditions. The 
K6G unit is unique , in that people housed there retain access to substantial programming —often 
more than what is available in the general population —and the jail has a large enough identified 
gay and transgender population to  fill multiple wings, so that inmates are not isolated and staff 
can separate LGBTI inmates from each other when needed. This is not the norm.  
 
Maintaining a unit based solely on sexual orientation or gender identity requires a demonstrated 
need, sufficien t facility size and LGBTI  inmate population , a basic level of cultural competence  
among staff , and an institutional commitment to safety and fairness toward these populations. 
Notably, such a separate, protective unit has never been successfully implemente d in a women‘s 
facility. JDI recommend s that placing adult inmates in particular beds, wings or units solely on 
the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, genital status or birth gender be permitted only 
when, as in L os Angeles County, such placemen t is based on a finding, made by a judge or 
outside expert, that these inmate groups cannot be housed safely by other means.  
 
§ 115.342 Placement of residents in housing, bed, program, education, and work assignments  
JDI commends the Department for prohib iting agencies from placing LGBTI residents in 
particular housing, bed or other assignments solely on the basis of such identification or status . 
Unfortunately, many juvenile facilities segregate or isolate LGBTI youth , ostensibly  for their 
own protection,  sometimes by placing these residents in sex offender units. While presumably 
intended to keep LGBTI youth safer than they would be in general population, this practice 
essentially punishes LGBTI youth and denies them access to the same privileges and prog rams 
as other residents. As discussed above, a modified version of this prohibition  should be instituted  
for adult facilities  as well.  
 
Recommendation:  Limit the extent to which vulnerable residents are isolated by 
amending paragraph (c) as follows:  
 Residents may be isolated from others only as a last resort when less restrictive 
measures are inadequate to keep them and other residents safe, and then only until 
an alternative means of keeping all residents safe can be arranged.  
(1) If isolation is unavoi dable, the agency shall review the use of isolation every 
24 hours and document the reason for continued isolation.  
(2) The agency shall not hold youth in isolation conditions for a continuous 
period of more than 72 hours.    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 61 (3) Residents placed in isolation  shall have access to education, recreation, 
counseling , and other programming.  
 
The proposed standard s appropriately require individualized placements, but should be 
strengthened to ensure placements are appropriate and to avoid isolating LGBTI and other  
vulnerable residents unnecessarily. Recent research confirms the serious dangers associated with 
isolation of youth, including increased suicide risk and long -term psychiatric problems.72  
Additionally, isolation deprives youth of programming designed to s upport their rehabilitation, 
such as educational services.73 Isolating residents who may be at risk of victimization has the 
effect of singling those youth out for punishment based solely on safety concerns.  
 
The Department should do more to minimize the i solation of vulnerable youth. By limiting 
isolation to a maximum of 72 hours, the Department can reduce the negative consequences of 
this practice for youth in secure facilities, while providing adequate time for facilities to find 
appropriate housing with out extended isolation . By requiring that isolated youth  enjoy the same 
privileges as other residents, the standards will also avoid punishing youth based on their risk of 
victimization.  
 
The use of isolation in juvenile facilities should also be subject t o oversight and review mandates 
similar to those required for the use of protective custody in adult facilities, with shorter time 
frames to account for the increased harm of isolating youth. Specifically, juvenile agencies 
should review the use of isolati on daily, to ensure that it remains the only safe option and is used 
purely as a last resort. Juvenile facilities should also be required to document its use of protective 
isolation. In addition to creating a record should a youth or his/her legal guardian  wish to

 62 challenge such isolation , the documentation will help track the use of protective isolation and 
identify whether facilities are employing isolation too readily. Such data may also assist the 
Department and other organizations in providing guidance  and technical assistance to 
jurisdictions on reducing the use of isolation.  
 
Recommendation:  Provide greater guidance on how to determine whether a 
transgender or intersex resident should be housed in a boys’ or girls’ facility or unit 
with the following  changes:  
(e) The agency shall make an individualized determination about whether a 
transgender or intersex  resident should be housed with males or with females. Such 
a determination shall not be based solely on the resident’s genital status or birth 
gende r. In deciding whether to assign a transgender or intersex resident to a facility 
or unit for male or female residents, and in making other housing and programming 
assignments, the agency shall consider on a case -by-case basis whether the 
placement would e nsure the resident’s health and safety. Transgender and intersex 
residents’ own views with respect to their own safety shall be given serious 
consideration.  
(f) Placement and programming assignments for transgender and intersex residents 
shall be reassesse d at least twice each year to review any threats to safety 
experienced by the se resident s.  
 
Many juvenile facilities struggle with appropriate housing options for transgender and intersex 
residents and will base this determination solely on the resident‘s  genital status. These residents 
are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse . The standard  on this topic for adult prisons and jails 
provides better guidance  for agencies  and better protections for transgender and intersex 
individuals than do the juvenile st andards . Because inappropriate placements of transgender and 
intersex residents greatly increase their risk of victimization, this standard should provide 
additional guidance to agencies on what to consider when determining whether a transgender or 
interse x resident will be housed in a boys‘ or girls‘ facility or living unit. Considering that many 
officials lack experience in working with transgender and intersex residents, it is especially 
important that a transgender or intersex resident‘s own views with respect to his or her own 
safety be considered seriously in all placement determinations for that resident.  
 
§ 115.43/243  Protective custody  
As is true for  juvenile detainees, extended isolation of vulnerable adult inmates is 
psychologically  harmful and rarely an appropriate means of protection. Protective custody is   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 63 punitive by default , as it results in a loss of services and programs, can brand someone as a 
victim and/or a snitch, and often leaves the inmate with less access to outside support. Relying 
on isolation to protect inmates who are vulnerable or have been victimized discourages inmates 
generally from informing officials about their vulnerabilities and from reporting abuse. As a 
result, involuntary segregated housing must be used for protection o nly as a last resort.  
 
Ironically, while the Department justified many of its revisions to the Commission‘s 
recommendations as a means to reduce costs, it neglected to consider the substantial costs of 
segregated housing.  In a 2009 report, the California Inspector General estimated that, based on 
needs for increased staffing and greater physical space,  the annual costs per inmate in 
administrative segregation  average at least $14,600 more than the annual costs per inmate in the 
general population.74 In ligh t of these increased costs, the California Inspector General found that 
the overuse of administrative segregation cost the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation nearly $11 million every year.75    
 
While the Department states that the use of protective custody authorized by the proposed 
standards will not impose  new costs on the BOP, since the proposed standard is consistent with 
current BOP policy,76 the BOP and other agencies can , like the CDCR,  save millions of dollars 
by limiting their u se of involuntary segregation, thereby preserving additional funds for more 
effective prevention and response measures.  
 
Recommendation:  Require further restrictions and documentation requirements on 
protective custody by amending paragraphs (c) and (d) a s follows:  
 (c) The agency shall not ordinarily assign such an inmate to segregated housing 
involuntarily for a period exceeding 90 ten days.  
(d) If an extension is necessary  Whenever an inmate is involuntarily placed in 
protective custody , the agency shal l clearly document:  
(1) The basis for the agency’s concern for the inmate’s safety; and 
(2) The reason why no alternative means of separation can be arranged ;

opportunities have be en limited; and  
(4) The plan for providing safe, less restrictive housing for the inmate in the 
future.  
(e) Every 90 10 days, the agency shall afford each such inmate a review to determine 
whether there is a continuing need for separation from the general population. Each 
review that results in continued segregation should be documented in accordance 
with (d).  
 
While the Department specifies  some  restrictions on the use of involuntary protective custody, its 
proposed standard  here still allows the indefinit e placement of  vulnerable inmates in involuntary 
segregation, without sufficient access to programming and work assignments  – or sufficient 
means to challenge this designation. Shorter deadlines are needed to discourage prolonged 
isolation. Moreover, agenc ies must fully document the use of involuntary protective custody – to 
allow inmates to challenge this involuntary status; to track the extent to which it is relied upon by 
facilities as a means of protecting vulnerable populations; and to enable monitors to review 
whether it is overused.  
 
Recommendation:  Add the following paragraph to this provision:  
 (f) When an inmate identified as vulnerable to sexual victimization requests to be 
placed in protective custody, the agency shall make a decision as to the individual’s 
request within 24 hours. During the period in which the agency makes  its decision, 
the individual shall be placed in segregation. Should the agency deny the 
individual’s request, the agency shall (1) document the grounds for the denial; and 
(2) provide for an expedited appeal by the individual requesting protective custody.  
 
While many inmates are involuntarily segregated, some vulnerable individuals do request 
housing in protective custody for their own safety. The proposed standard s provide n o guidance 
for agencies on how to handle requests for segregation. Inmates are often in the best position to 
assess their safety in general population, but far too often their requests are not seriously 
considered until after they have been assaulted. The Department should encourage agencies to 
review these requests promptly, as a prevention measure .

 65 VI. Reporting  
§ 115.51/151/251/351 Inmate reporting  
JDI commends the Department for recognizing the need for both inmates and staff to be able to 
report abu se privately.77 Whether as victims or witnesses, inmates need reporting options that 
they feel are safe and trustworthy, which for some individuals will only occur with anonymity. 
Allowing staff to report the abuse privately will likewise increase a staff m ember‘s willingness to 
address  sexual abuse . Corrections culture too often includes a willingness  on the part  of staff to 
―turn a blind eye‖ when a colleague or powerful inmate behaves inappropriately. A private 
reporting option, partnered with zero -tolera nce for sexual abuse, may encourage staff who would 
otherwise remain silent to report sexual abuse and sexual harassment.  
 
Recommendation : Require agencies to make their best efforts to establish an external 
reporting option, and to allow reporting to external  entities to be anonymous by 
amending paragraph (b) as follows:  
Pursuant to § 115.22, the agency shall also make its best efforts to provide at least 
one way for inmates to report abuse or harassment to an outside governmental entity 
that is not affil iated with the agency or that is operationally independent from 
agency leadership, such as an inspector general or ombudsperson, and that is able 
to receive and immediately forward inmate reports of sexual abuse and sexual 
harassment to agency officials , allowing the reporting inmate to remain anonymous 
upon request. If there is no outside entity able to accept such reports, the agency 
shall establish a reporting mechanism that is operationally independent from agency 
leadership.  
 
For the reasons discussed above ( addressing  standard § 115.22/222/322), the Department‘s 
elimination  of the requirement that inmates have access to an external, confidential reporting 
option is very problematic. Victimized inmates often have legitimate reasons for not trusting 
memb ers of the agency that failed to protect them from sexual abuse in the first instance, and an 
―operationally independent‖ entity remains part of the agency for these purposes. Moreover, an 
                                                 
77 The term ―confidentially ‖ is used throughout the standards , in a few different contexts. P resumably any report 
would trigger an investigation and the disclosure of some information. Confidentiality generally precludes s haring 
any information provided  by a client in the course of requesting or receiving services, except in limited 
circumstances such as imminent harm, knowledge of child abuse or with the client's explicit, written permission . For 
clarity, the Department ma y want to use the word ―anonymous ‖ when referring to an inmates' ability to report abuse 
to a staff member, administrator, ombudsperson or outside entity without revealing their own identity. When staff 
members responding to an allegation of sexual abuse a re required to safeguard information, including the identity of 
the victim and alleged perpetrator, and provide information only to those individuals who need it to complete an 
investigation, a more  accurate description would be ― report privately. ‖ 
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 66 anonymous reporting option may be the only way for an inmate to fee l safe reporting sexual 
abuse. Despite the fact that an anonymous report will not allow for a full investigation into the 
incident, it will provide facility staff with important information about sexual violence within the 
facility, including information t hat may help officials track trends and become aware of areas in 
the facility that are not safe.  
 
In § 115.351, the Department‘s requirement that youth have access to the tools necessary to 
make a written report is an important improvement to the Commissio n‘s recommendations . The 
lesser  capacity and greater developmental needs  of youth  are often cited to justify  giving them  
less access to legal resources  than adults have . Nonetheless, the legal system imposes the same 
procedural hurdles on juvenile resident s as it does on adult inmates. Youth need to be provided 
with these basic materials to  document their concerns.  
 
Question 23 : Should the final rule mandate that agencies provide inmates with the option 
of making a similarly restricted report to an outside public entity? To what extent, if any, 
would such an option conflict with applicable State or local law?  
 
Though the intention behind the military‘s ―restricted reporting‖ system is good, in practice, it 
often creates unnecessary confusion and provides vic tims with false promises of privacy. For 
example, if a survivor in the military system reports sexual abuse to the wrong person, that 
person will still have to report the abuse. Commanders who receive reports of sexual abuse are 
also free to pursue an inve stigation, even if that goes against the wishes of the survivor. While 
the ―restricted reporting‖ option allows some military personnel to receive medical care 
following a sexual assault without triggering an investigation, some states require medical staf f 
to report all sexual abuse to authorities. Similar concerns are likely to arise in the corrections 
context, without survivors understanding the consequences of their reports becoming 
―unrestricted‖ until after the fact.  
 
In order to model the intention a nd most positive aspects of the military‘s ―restricted reporting‖ 
option without succumbing to its  shortcomings , JDI recommends that the Department allow for 
anonymity when ever requested by the inmate , as allowed by federal and state law .

 67 § 115.52/252/352  Exhaustion of administrative remedies  
 
Question 24 : Because the Department’s proposed standard addressing administrative 
remedies differs significantly from the Commission’s draft, the Department specifically 
encourages comments on all aspects of this pr oposed standard.  
 
As the Department acknowledges, there is ―strong evidence that victims of sexual abuse are 
often constrained in their ability to pursue grievances,‖ due to unrealistic and arbitrary deadlines 
and requirements.78 As scores of cases have sho wn, even where sexual abuse committed by 
officials is not controverted, adult prisoners and juvenile residents are often denied legal redress 
because of hyper -technical requirements.79 Still more cases are never brought to the attention of 
officials because , having missed a deadline or other requirement, survivors know that filing a 
grievance will yield no positive benefit but may subject them to further abuse and other 
retaliation.  
 
Requiring that harsh grievance policies be loosened for  complaints of  sexua l abuse in detention 
is not inconsistent with the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).80 The PLRA created various 
barriers to redress by the courts  that are unique to inmates , including a requirement that  inmates 
fully  navigate the grievance procedures at t heir facilit ies.81 The law provides no mandates on the 
content of these grievance procedures. However, in response to the law, agencies nationwide 
have avoided responsibility for abuses by erecting harsh requirements for substantive review of 
complaints, in cluding unrealistically short deadlines, multiple levels of appeal, and confusing 
distinctions between who can receive a report of sexual abuse generally and which reports will 
be deemed grievances.

 68  
The PLRA was intended to weed out frivolous prisoner law suits, not to bar legitimate cases of 
sexual abuse and harassment  from judicial review . Effective grievance systems and access to 
court when officials fail to prevent and respond to sexual violence are important internal 
monitoring and external oversight m echanisms – allowing victims to seek redress and 
encouraging officials to make the changes necessary to prevent such abuses in the future.  
 
As proposed, t he Department‘s s tandard does not ensure that legitimate claims of sexual abuse 
and harassment are su bstantively reviewed, rather than being derailed by  confusing and 
unrealistic technical requirements.  
  
Recommendation : Remove the grievance filing deadline by replacing paragraph (a) 
with the following:  
Under agency policy, a n inmate  has exhausted his or her administrative remedies 
with regard to a claim of sexual abuse or sexual harassment either:  
(1) When the agency makes a final decision on the merits of the report of abuse 
or harassment, regardless of whether the report was made by the inmate , made 
by a third party, or forwarded from an outside official or office; or  
(2) When 90 days have passed since the report was made, whichever occurs 
sooner .  
 
JDI strongly believes that no survivor of sexual abuse or harassment should be subject to harsh 
and arbitr ary grievance deadlines. Fear, shame, and the prospect of enduring further abuse and 
retaliation are powerful disincentives to filing a grievance, particularly for the many victimized 
inmates who have brought prior reports that were ignored or, worse, caused them to be subjected 
to punitive and/or more dangerous conditions. Limited education, lack of sufficient support 
services, and the triggering of prior trauma further preclude victims from being able to overcome 
these barriers within the Department‘s pro posed 20-day deadline .  
  
Even if the Department takes the unfortunate position of  creating deadlines for adult inmates, it 
should not do so for young survivors. Children are especially hesitant to report abuse or to use a 
facility‘s grievance system, and their limited cognitive and emotional development may make it 
particularly hard  for them  to do so . It is often difficult for young people to understand their rights 
as entitlements that they can exercise without adverse consequences; they are more likely t han   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 69 adults to acquiesce to authority figures rather than assert those rights.82  Abusers often convince 
young victims that if they reveal the abuse, they will get in trouble or other harm might come to 
them or someone they care about. Moreover, youth are ge nerally not held in juvenile facilities 
for extended periods of time, further reducing the need for short deadlines.  
 
Recommendation : JDI explicitly opposes the use of filing deadline s. However, if the 
Department insists on  retain ing such requirements , it must provide a more realistic 
timeframe by amending paragraph (a) as follows:  
(1) The agency shall provide an inmate a minimum of 20 180 days following the  
occurrence of an alleged incident of sexual abuse or sexual harassment to file a 
grievance regardin g such incident.  
(2) The agency shall grant an extension of no less than 90 days from the deadline 
for filing such a grievance when the inmate provides documentation, such as from a 
medical or mental health provider or counselor, that filing a grievance wi thin the 
normal time limit was or would likely be impractical, whether due to physical or 
psychological trauma arising out of an incident of sexual abuse, the resident having 
been held for periods of time outside of the facility, or other circumstances 
indicating impracticality. Such an extension shall be afforded retroactively to an 
inmate whose grievance is filed subsequent to the normal filing deadline.  
 
The Department relies on the BOP grievance policy as the benchmark for its proposed filing 
deadline.  Such a baseline will not , however, improve survivors‘ ability to pursue grievances or 
access the courts . Worse still, i n many systems it may result in grievance requirements becoming 
more stringent. In particular, the 20 -day deadline for a rape victim to f ile a grievance, with an

normal time limit was or would not be practical,‖ is  unacceptable . 
 
Like survivors in the community, victimized inmates are typically in s hock for months after an 
assault. Most incarcerated survivors will ultimately be diagnosed with Rape Trauma Syndrome 
(RTS) or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).83 Both conditions include an initial crisis period

 70 – known as the ―acute phase‖ – during whic h survivors experience significant distress that 
disrupts all major spheres of life. One of the defining characteristics of acute RTS and acute 
PTSD is avoidant behavior – persistent avoidance of thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations 
that cause the s urvivor to recollect the traumatic event. Filing a report and entering into the 
grievance process are actions that a survivor would typically avoid while in the acute period .  
 
The duration and severity of the symptoms will vary depending on factors such a s prior trauma, 
perceived level of helplessness during the traumatic event, relationship to the abuser, and level of 
support received after the abuse. However, the most severe symptoms often last for three 
months, while many people  experience symptoms for longer than twelve months after the 
traumatic event.84 These timeframes are based on experiences of victims in the  free world  and 
assume that there are no subsequent traumatic events. As the Department's surveys indicate, 
however, prisoner rape survivors ar e likely to be victimized repeatedly. Moreover, people with 
prior victimization or mental illnesses (both of which are dramatically more prevalent among 
inmates than in the community) also commonly experience unusually severe  symptoms . In light 
of these co nsiderations, a deadline of 20 days to file a grievance is woefully inadequate.  
 
The 90 -day extension for victims who can document trauma does not negate the inadequacies of 
that unrealistic deadline. All survivors of sexual assault can be expected to expe rience a level of 
distress that prevents them from accessing grievance procedures and medical or mental health 
care well past the 20 -day deadline, and most can be expected to experience severe symptoms 
until at least 90 days after the assault. A traumatize d prisoner, and especially one who fears 
retaliation, is as unlikely to be able to secure timely medical or mental health assistance as she or 
he is to be able to file a timely grievance. In the worst systems, even victims who have the 
wherewithal to reque st help still may not be able to access competent services in a timely 
manner. In fact, sexual abuse grievances often include complaints that sufficient response 
services were not provided. Thus, the ability to file a  grievance becomes contingent upon the 
ability to access timely assistance.

 71 Moreover, creating an eviden ce-based extension to the harsh 20 -day deadline will result in 
administrative challenges, and ultimately litigation, focused on the sufficiency of such evidence. 
Issues will inevitably aris e with respect to a range of questions, including: when must the 
documentation be obtained; who is qualified to provide it; what recourse there is for an inmate 
who cannot access a qualified provider in time; and how the credibility of the documentation is  
established. Rather than creating a system that would generate such issues, a more effective use 
of resources would be to recognize that any inmate who has been sexually victimized is likely to 
have experienced some trauma. Therefore, at the very minimum,  inmates should be provided 
with six months to file sexual abuse claims.  
 
Recommendation : Ensure that all timely reports are considered grievances by adding 
the following paragraph to this standard:  
A complaint lodged with any established reporting entity,  including any staff 
member or established outside reporting body, shall trigger the highest -level 
grievance process in the facility.  
 
While the proposed standard allows for a third -party complaint to begin the grievance process (if 
the victimized inmate t akes subsequent steps to establish that he or she wants the complaint 
pursued), the Department does not make clear that an inmate‘s complaint to any staff member or 
established outside reporting entity, in accordance with proposed Standard § 115.51/251/351 , 
must be treated as a grievance. Nor does the proposed standard ensure that sexual abuse and 
harassment grievances will be kept private and afforded the highest level of review.  
 
As the Department recognizes, multiple avenues for reporting are vitally imp ortant to 
maximizing the information provided to officials and ensuring that survivors have safe and 
effective ways of complaining.85 Failing to allow for each reporting mechanism to trigger a 
grievance will add further confusion to already complex exhausti on requirements and further 
disenfranchise sexually victimized inmates from judicial relief. Recent cases in Iowa and New 
York make clear the need for this requirement to be explicit. In both states, female  prisoners 
relied upon agency materials encouragin g them to complain to trusted entities (in Iowa a case 
manager, in New York the Inspector General), which they did. In subsequent court action, the

 72 agencies successfully argued that because these reporters were not part of the official grievance 
system, ju dicial review was procedurally barred.86  
 
The sensitive information contained in a sexual abuse or harassment grievance needs to be 
shared discretely, due to the same safety considerations at issue during an administrative and/or 
criminal investigation. Wh ile many agencies have grievance systems with multiple levels – 
starting with a complaint to an officer, which must be followed by additional filings for review 
up the chain of command – complaints pertaining to sexual abuse or harassment, particularly if 
staff members are implicated, should go directly to the warden or other high -level official with 
final authority over such complaints. Such a practice would help ensure that sexual abuse and 
harassment grievances are treated with the appropriate level of s eriousness and attention, 
consistent with the requirements for investigations.  
 
Recommendation : Do not allow for inmates or residents to be disciplined for filing an 
emergency grievance in good faith, by amending paragraph (d)(5) as follows:  
An agency may only discipline an inmate for intentionally  filing an emergency 
grievance where no emergency exists and the agency establishes that the inmate had 
no basis to believe that an emergency existed and that such grievance was filed with 
the intent to deceive. S uch findings must be documented in writing in the inmate’s 
file. 
 
As written, the proposed standard authorizes agencies to punish victimized inmates who 
reasonably believe that an emergency exists, if the agency ultimately disagrees with the victim‘s 
asses sment. Such a policy will serve as a significant disincentive to reporting. Inmates are often 
hesitant to report legitimate claims of abuse because they think no one will believe them, 
particularly when it is their word against a staff member‘s. While the agency should be able to 
sanction inmates who misuse the emergency grievance process, it should only be permitted do so 
when the inmate is found to have acted in bad faith.

 73 § 115.53/25 3/353 Inmate access to outside confidential support services  
Providing  inmates with access to trained advocates who can maintain confidentiality helps 
ensure that inmates receive compassionate, skilled support services. This, in turn, encourages 
victimized inmates to report sexual abuse to officials. Confidential counseling provides survivors 
with a safe and trusted way to discuss the sexual violence they have experienced, deal with their 
fears, develop appropriate coping skills, and understand that the abuse was not their fault. 
Confidential support may also improve a surviv or‘s ability to participate in an investigation and 
will enhance institutional safety. A survivor who receives quality mental health care services also 
is likely to encourage other victimized inmates to come forward.  
 
Recommendation : Modify paragraph (a) t o require : 
 access to outside victim advocates …, and by enabling reasonable communication 
between inmates and these organizations, as confidential as possible, to the extent 
allowed by law  consistent with agency needs . 
 
While the standard here recognizes  the benefit of providing access to outside victim advocates 
for emotional support services, allowing  this communication to  be only ―as confidential as 
possible, consistent with agency security needs,‖ will dramatically reduce the effectiveness of 
this prov ision and make it difficult for auditors to measure compliance.  Worse still, this 
provision will enable particularly troubled facilities that are acting in bad faith to refer to ‗agency 
needs‘ whenever seeking to prevent information about abuse from reachi ng outside the facility.  
 
Confidential counseling is one of the most important best practices in the community, and it is 
the norm in professional and ethical standards for mental health professionals. Nonetheless, some 
corrections agencies refuse to allo w service providers to offer confidential counseling based on 
the mistaken belief that confidential counseling will limit officials‘ ability to learn about (and 
therefore address) crimes within the facility. In practice, however, survivors who are able to 
share their ordeal confidentially generally feel safe and supported and, as such, are much more 
likely to report abuse and be able to fully cooperate with investigation s and prosecution.87

 74 Agencies should not be able to limit these life -saving services base d on the common 
misperception that confidentiality conflict s with their ‗agency needs. ‘ 
 
Limitations on confidentiality that have been identified and defined by the relevant legislature 
are the result of deliberation that has balanced the benefits of provi ding safe services, even for 
victims who do not want to initiate an investigation, with the value of providing law enforcement 
with timely information about ongoing crimes. ‗Agency security needs ,‘ in contrast , is a vague 
and broad measure. Officials may d efine this need differently from one another, and health care 
professionals are likely to define it differently than officials. On the one hand, any instance of 
wrongdoing relates to security and could therefore justify barring any confidentiality. On the 
other hand, absolute confidentiality can be justified as a good security measure, as information 
provided confidentially is unlikely otherwise to be shared at all. If the standard continues to limit 
confidentiality based on ‗agency security needs, ‘ how to determine these needs must be 
explicitly defined, in advance, both to ensure that service providers (and officials) have sufficient 
guidance in providing services  and for auditors to be able to monitor compliance with the 
standard . Ultimately, given the pr oven benefits of confidentiality and the professional ethical 
obligations of counselors, the legal restrictions on confidentiality should be considered sufficient 
for agency security needs.  
 
Recommendation : Add sexual harassment to § 155.53(a).  
 
As discus sed above ( addressing  § 155.22/222/322), sexual  harassment frequently escalate s into 
sexual abuse , and community service providers are skilled in assisting victims who have endured 
all forms of unwanted sexual activity. Adding sexual harassment to this pro vision would help 
provide inmates with the information and safety planning tools they need to address sexual 
harassment.  
 
§ 115.54/154/254/354 Third -party reporting  
JDI commends the Department for recognizing the value of third -party reporting. Some inmat es 
may be too afraid to report abuse directly to officials, but will tell a trusted family member o r 
other loved one about their victimization. Allowing third parties to express their concern and   Just Detention International

VII. Official Response Following Inmate Report  
§ 115.61/161/261/361 Staff and agency reporting duties  
The Department makes a commendable effort to  balance competing claims here,  accommo dating 
staff‘s  need to share knowledge, suspicions, and information about sexual abuse with their 
superiors and colleagues while also maintaining some protections against unnecessarily 
disclosing sensitive information. Additional protections limiting the a mount of information 
shared among staff and preserving the confidential relationship between medical and mental 
health staff and patients  would greatly improve this standard.  
 
Recommendation : Clarify the extent of information provided to staff who “need to  
know” about a sexual report by modifying paragraph (b) as follows:  
Apart from reporting to designated supervisors or officials, staff shall not reveal any 
information related to a sexual abuse report to anyone other than those who need to 
know, as specifi ed in agency policy, to make treatment, investigation, and other 
security and management decisions . Such personnel shall receive only th e 
information necessary for them to perform their job function s safely and effectively.   
 
The Department rightly limits the sharing of information about sexual abuse report s to staff who 
need this information in order to make treatment, investigation , and other security decisions. 
However, the fact that a staff member needs some information about a sexual abuse report does 
not mean that all such information must, or should, be shared. Rather, to maintain privacy about  
this highly sensitive matter  to the fullest extent possible, staff should only receive the 
information necessary for them to perform their job function s.  
 
Recommendation : Align medical and mental health staff reporting obligations to the 
obligations of analogous professionals in the community  by modifying paragraph (c) 
as follows:  
Unless otherwise precluded by In accordance with Federal, State, or local law, as 
well as legal and ethical standards of their profession s, medical and mental health 
practitioners shall be determine whether  they are  required to report sexual abuse 
pursuant to paragraph(a) of this section and to inform inmates of the practitioner's 
duty to report , and the limits of confidentiality,  at the initiation of services and each 
time that the practitioner makes the determination that he or she is required or 
permitted to breach confidentiality.  The agency shall specify as a matter or written    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 76 policy the extent  of health providers obligation to report  sexual abuse, relying on 
existing professional standards and an ethics -based decision model.  
 
JDI commends the Department for requiring medical and mental health practitioners to inform 
inmates at the commencement of services of any duty to report  they may have , thereby securing 
informed consent before inmates disclose any information. However, the standard should allow 
for greater confidentiality between inmates and medical and mental health staff, rat her than 
holding health professionals to reporting obligations that are similar to those of  other staff.  
 
In the community, confidentiality is recognized as an important health care practice, as it 
encourages full disclosure of information that may be rel evant to treatment. While confidentiality 
can be breached to share information that places the patient or others at risk of serious harm, 
information about prior crimes is generally not disclosed, except when the local law requires 
certain injuries resulti ng from criminal activity, such as gun or knife wounds, to be disclosed to 
law enforcement.  
 
The issue of whether medical and mental health practitioners in corrections settings should be 
required to report sexual abuse (apart from when such reports are r equired by law ) is a complex 
one that remains unresolved in the field.88 Corrections health practitioners have to consider 
safety and security issues beyond those facing practitioners in the community, but such 
considerations should not preclude treating  information  confidentially  simply because officials 
may prefer to  receive it . If the confidentiality of medical and mental health communications  is 
not protected , victimized inmates will be far less likely to seek treatment.  
 
The leading standards for correc tions health care recommend confidentiality in prison counseling 
sessions, unless the disclosed information concerns a contemplated crime, indicates  clear and 
imminent danger or is required  to be shared  by court order.89 While some sexual abuse of

 77 prisoners  may create a clear and imminent danger, in light of the frequent targeting of prior 
victims, far from all disclosures of abuse will fall into this category. Agencies should be required 
to create appropriate policies that balance these concerns , in accorda nce with relevant state law 
and local practices.  
 
§ 115.62/162/262/362 Reporting to other confinement facilities  
Many victimized inmates will wait until they have been transferred  to another facility  before 
reporting that they have been sexually abused by a staff member or another inmate. The 
Department wisely requires the facility receiving the report to transmit this information to the 
facility where the abuse occurred. However, the time frame  given  for providing the information 
conflicts with the require ments of § 115.71/171/271/371, to conduct prompt investigations, and 
with those of paragraph (b) of this provision, to ensure that an allegation is investigated in 
accordance with the standards.  
 
Recommendation : Ensure that prompt investigations occur by a mending paragraph (a) 
as follows:  
Within 14 days of Immediately upon  receiving an allegation that an inmate was 
sexually abused while confined at another facility, the head of the facility that 
received the allegation shall notify in writing  the head of t he facility or appropriate 
central office of the agency where the alleged abuse occurred. Verbal notice shall be 
provided within one business day, followed by notice in writing within three business 
days.  
   
Law enforcement agencies in the community often have to cross -report information because a 
crime occurred in multiple jurisdictions or because of considerable  distance between the place 
where the crime occurred and where the victim currently resides. Such reporting is generally 
required to happen immedi ately, to allow for prompt investigations.90 Placing similar time 
restrictions on cross -reporting among correction s facilities will help ensure that all sexual abuse 
reports are treated with the same level of urgency regardless of whether the abuse occurred  at the 
reporting facility.

 78 § 115.63/163/263/363 Staff first responder duties  
As the Department acknowledges, first responders need specific guidance on what actions to take 
to assist in the subsequent investigation and to secure any potential evidence.  In most instances, 
however, these individuals are not equipped to determine whether the report was made ―within a 
time period that still allows for the collection of physical evidence.‖  
 
Recommendation : Amend paragraph (a) as follows:  
Upon learning that a n inmate was sexually abused within a time period that still 
allows for the collection of physical evidence , regardless of when the abuse 
occurred , the first security staff member to respond to the report shall be required 
to:  
(1) Separate the alleged vi ctim and perpetrator;  
(2) Seal and preserve any crime scene, keeping in mind the possibility of multiple 
crime scenes, until a trained investigator can determine if physical evidence may 
be present ; and  
(3) Request the victim not to take any actions that  could destroy physical evidence, 
including washing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, urinating, defecating, 
smoking, drinking, or eating, until a trained forensic medical professional has 
been consulted .  
 
The science of collecting sexual assault evidenc e is ever -changing and advancing, extending 
timeframes in which evidence can still be collected. Many reports of prison er rape are delayed 
disclosures, requiring agencies to take a proactive approach to sexual assault investigations. 
Physical evidence migh t be in the form of clothing, documentable injuries, or notes written 
between the perpetrator and victim that persist well after 120 hours. JDI has heard from survivors 
who have preserved physical evidence in their cells for months or years.91 Regardless of  how 
much time has passed, the initial assumption must always be that evidence might be available.  
 
§ 115.64/164/264/364 Coordinated response  
Coordinated responses  to sexual abuse in detention , such as institution -based sexual assault 
response teams (SART s), ensure that all relevant corrections staff is seamlessly engaged.

 79 Leading researchers have consistently found that a coordinated response is beneficial to 
survivors.92 The Department wisely encourages this best practice.  
 
Recommendation:  Require agencie s to develop an institutional plan for a coordinated 
response by amending this provision as follows:  
The facility shall develop an institutional plan to  coordinate actions taken in 
response to an incident of sexual abuse, among staff first responders, medi cal and 
mental health practitioners, investigators, and facility leadership , using community -
based sexual assault response teams (SARTs) as a model . 
 
The presence of a coordinated team that responds immediately and professionally following a 
report of sexu al assault is a proven mechanism for encouraging reports and securing the victim‘s 
cooperation with an investigation. A number of state corrections departments, including those in 
California, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, have developed institution -based SARTs  and have seen 
first-hand the value of this model for staff and inmates alike. SART members report that they 
feel more empowered to respond to sexual abuse reports because they are well trained and work 
as a team. Their timely and seamless responses to sex ual abuse reports allow them to serve 
incarcerated survivors effectively and to fulfill their facilities‘ zero-tolerance policy on sexual 
abuse.  
 
Question 25 : Does this standard provide sufficient guidance as to how compliance would 
be measured? If not, ho w should it be revised?  
 
In addition to helping in the formalization of a best practice, requiring a written institutional plan 
will create a measurable deliverable that can assist with compliance monitoring. This plan should 
include a list of staff positi ons that make up the response team and the duties of response team 
members, which the monitor can confirm upon visit s to the facility and/or in conversation with 
relevant staff.

 80 Standard 115.65/165/265/365 Agency protection against retaliation  
 
Recommend ation : Require a policy detailing who should conduct the monitoring and 
how monitoring will take place by amending paragraph (a) as follows:  
The agency shall protect all inmates and staff who report sexual abuse or sexual 
harassment or cooperate with sexua l abuse or sexual harassment investigations 
from retaliation by other inmates or staff by establishing a policy that prohibits 
retaliation, designates which staff members or department s are charged with 
monitoring retaliation, and requires that the inmate or staff member at risk of 
retaliation be interviewed regularly during the monitoring period.  
 
The Department laudably requires agencies to address retaliation through concrete measures and 
ongoing monitoring. By formalizing this practice into a written po licy that specifies  who will 
conduct th e monitoring and mandates that the se individuals  gather information from the person 
at risk of retaliation, the Department can increase the likelihood that this monitoring is conducted  
effectively. A written policy will also assist the auditor in measuring compliance with this 
provision.  
 
Question 26 : Should the standard be further refined to provide additional guidance 
regarding when continuing monitoring is warranted, or is the current language 
sufficient?  
 
Monitorin g should continue until no new incidents of retaliation have occurred for 90 days. 
Retaliation may take many forms, some subtle and some that would constitute new criminal acts. 
If retaliation rises to the level of additional abuse, or if the inmate or sta ff member expresses a 
fear for her or his safety, that should be considered a new event, and a new 90 -day monitoring 
period should commence after corrective actions have been taken.  
 
§ 115.66/366 Post -allegation protective custody  
Post-allegation protecti ve custody is just as problematic as involuntary protective custody  – it

VIII. Investigations  
§ 115.71/171/271/371 Criminal and administrative agency investigations  
Investigations are a critical component  of preventing and res ponding to sexual abuse. Sound 
investigative policies and practices ensure that perpetrators are held accountable, assure victims 
that their complaints will be taken seriously, and set a tone that underscores the zero -tolerance 
policy  to deter further abuse. While the Department‘s standard s includes key provisions 
regarding the collection and assessment of evidence, the coordination of criminal and 
administrative investigations, and the creation and retention of records, further guidan ce is 
needed to ensure that agencies conduct investigations in a thorough and timely manner.  
 
Recommendation:   Amend paragraph (a) as follows:  
When the agency conducts its own investigations into allegations of sexual abuse, it 
shall initiate a preliminary  investigation immediately, by assessing the availability of 
physical evidence and determining what crime is alleged, where it occurred, and 
who was involved or a witness. The agency shall complete the investigation  do so 
promptly, thoroughly and objective ly, using investigators who have received special 
training in sexual abuse investigations pursuant to 115.34, and shall investigate all 
allegations of sexual abuse, including third -party and anonymous reports.  
 
Given the nature of physical evidence, the p otential for further trauma to the victim, and the cost 
to facilities of separating witnesses prior to their interview s, it is essential that an investigation 
begin s immediately and is completed promptly. The precise speed with which this must occur 
will d epend on the circumstances of the case , such as the length of time between the assault and 
the report, and the number of inmate and staff witnesses. Conducting a preliminary investigation 
right away, to determine the specific allegations and what evidence may be available, will also 
allow subsequent  investigations  and actions  to be undertaken as urgently as necessary .  
 
Recommendation : Add the following sentence to paragraph (b):  
The agency shall base its investigation protocol on available, accepted sexual  assault 
investigation protocols developed by law enforcement agencies within its state 
and/or jurisdiction.  
 
In the evidence protocol and forensic medical exams provision ( § 115.21/112/212), the 
Department rightly requires agencies to rely upon the Natio nal Protocol for Sexual Assault   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice

 82 Medical Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents  when conducting forensic exams.93 
Similarly, the Department should require agencies to rely on established guidelines for their 
investigations protocol s. While there is no comparable federal protocol for investigations , as 
there is for forensic examinations, many states have models that can be relied upon and require 
only slight modifications to account for the detention setting.94  
 
Recommendation:  Amend paragraph (c) as follow s: 
When the quality of evidence appears to support criminal prosecution, tThe agency 
shall conduct compelled interviews only after  consult ing with prosecutors as (1) to 
determine whether or not the quality of evidence appears to support criminal 
prosecuti on; and (2) prior to conducting compelled interviews , to determine if  
compelled interviews may be an obstacle for subsequent criminal prosecution.  All 
investigations must be completed  and documented, and a case summary submitted to 
the prosecuting attorney  for review.  
   
The Department is correct to stipulate that agency investigators must consult with prosecutors 
prior to conducting compelled interviews. While facilit y investigators should be qualified to 
gather and assess information to determine whether  the alleg ed abuse  occurred, they generally do 
not have the qualifications to determine whether the quality of evidence meets the threshold 
needed for prosecution. Investigators should consult with prosecutors to determine whether the 
quality of evidence a ppears to support criminal prosecution. In addition, the data and conclusion 
of the investigation should be provided to prosecutors  for review – both to make a final 
determination about criminal action in that case and as quality assurance to ensure that i n-house 
investigations are conducted in a manner that encourages criminal prosecution where 
appropriate.  
 
Recommendation : Amend paragraph ( d) to add the following sentence:  
Polygraph testing for inmates who report sexual harassment and abuse is 
prohibited.   
 
Polygraph testing often yields inaccurate results and can be traumatizing to a survivor, crippling 
the effectiveness of an investigation , and damaging the rapport between an investigator and a 
                                                 
93 As discussed in the section on that provision, this protocol is not appropriate for pre -pubescent youth and 
therefore should not be relied upon exclusively in juvenile facilities.  
94 See, e.g., Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, Commonwealth of Massachusetts , Adult Sexual Assault 
Law Enforcement Guidelines (2009 ), available at  http://www.mass.gov/Eeops/docs/mptc/2009_SA_Final_6 -9-

 83 survivor. Given their significant flaws, it is not surprisin g that polygraph test results are often 
deemed inadmissible in court, and that the Department prohibits states receiving grants under the 
STOP (Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Violence Against Women Formula Grant 
Program (VAWA STOP Program) from  using polygraph testing for victims of sexual violence.95 
The PREA standards should conform to the limitations imposed for VAWA STOP grants.  
 
Recommendation : modify paragraph (k) to require a written plan for coordinating 
investigations related to the same  abuse:  
(k) When outside agencies investigate sexual abuse, the facility shall cooperate with 
outside investigators and shall endeavor to remain informed about the progress of 
the investigation  develop a comprehensive, written plan, including a  memorandum 
of understanding , to guide the coordination of administrative and criminal 
investigations. The plan shall outline how the two entities' investigators will 
cooperate a round timing, communication, and information sharing throughout and 
at the conclusion of b oth investigations .  
 
Administrative investigations and criminal investigations may need to take place within the same 
timeframes and, in such cases, require careful coordination. By developing a plan with outside 
police agencies, where applicable, around timing, communication, and information sharing , both 
the administrative and criminal investigations will be more effective. Formalizing this plan in 
policy and/or a memorandum of understanding with the police agency responsible for 
investigations will ensu re that both agencies have a thorough understanding of their respective 
roles. Such clarity is particularly important as an administrative investigation might conclude 
before a decision has been made about whether to prosecute , and the outcome of either 
investigation could have an impact on determinations made in the other.  
  
Recommendation : Add sexual harassment to this standard.  
 
This standard should include investigations into allegations of sexual harassment, to ensure that 
such claims are taken seriou sly and to conform to § 115.23/123/223/323.  
 
§ 115.72/172/272/372 Evidentiary  standard for administrative investigations  
JDI strongly supports establishing that the evidentiary standard for substantiating administrative 
investigations shall not be higher t han the preponderance of the evidence.

§ 115.73/273/373 Reporting to inmates  
JDI commends the Department for requiring that certain information be shared with incarcerated 
survivors when the investigation into their report of sexual abuse has been conclu ded. 
Notification of the outcome of an investigation provides victims with closure and peace of mind, 
and the know ledge that their allegations were taken seriously and investigated thoroughly. The 
standard should be further strengthened by requiring simila r notifications when the perpetrator is 
another inmate.  
 
Recommendation : Add paragraph (d) to this provision, with the following language:  
Following an inmate’s allegation that another inmate(s) has committed sexual 
abuse, the agency shall subsequently inf orm the inmate whenever:  
(1) The inmate perpetrator(s) is no longer housed in the inmate’s unit or serving 
on the inmate’s work assignment, if applicable;  
(2) The inmate perpetrator(s) has been transferred to another facility;  
(3) The inmate perpetrator(s)  has been indicted on a charge related to the sexual 
abuse;  
(4) The inmate perpetrator(s) has been convicted on a charge related to the sexual 
abuse.  
 
Like victims of staff sexual misconduct, inmates who have been sexually abused by other 
inmates will bene fit greatly from knowing that the perpetrator is no longer at the facility and that 
the abuse is seriously addressed through criminal prosecution. While agencies have legitimate 
reasons for not providing inmates with many details about the housing and stat us of other 
individuals, sharing this basic information will not negatively impact security and may be crucial 
to a victim‘s ability to heal and feel safe in the facility.  
 
IX. Discipline  
§ 115.76/176/276/376 Disciplinary sanctions for staff  
 
Recommendati on: Amend paragraph (b) such that : 
Termination shall be the presumptive disciplinary sanction for staff who have 
engaged in sexual abuse  touching . 
 
Any type of sexual abuse  by staff is serious, harmful, and inexcusable. The Department‘s 
proposed  standard c reates a presumptive sanction for some forms of staff sexual abuse, but not   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 85 for indecent exposure or voyeurism. E mployees found to have committed these forms of abuse 
should also be subject to a presumption of termination , however . In addition to the poten tial 
security breaches, triggering of trauma, and other harm that may result from staff exposing 
themselves or forcing others to expose themselves, indecent exposure and voyeurism are known 
precursors to acts of sexually abusive touching or rape. Retaining  employees found to have 
committed these forms of sexual abuse puts inmates at risk of further and escalating 
victimization, and sends a message that the agency condones such abusive behavior —it is 
completely contrary to the requirement that facilities mus t have zero -tolerance of sexual abuse .  
 
§ 115.77/277/377 Disciplinary sanctions for inmates  
The Department rightly prohibits facilities from treating unsubstantiated good faith allegations of 
sexual abuse as false report s or lies. Gathering sufficient evi dence to substantiate a report is 
exceptionally challenging and, as a result, the majority of allegations end up unsubstantiated.96 
Physical evidence may not exist , inmate witnesses may be released, transferred, or uncooperative 
and, in instances of staff s exual misconduct, officials may withhold information to protect 
themselves or their colleagues. As the standard acknowledges, inmates should not be punished 
for these evidentiary barriers if their allegations are made in good faith.  
 
JDI also commends the  Department for recognizing that inmates cannot consent to sexual 
activity with staff, but that consensual sexual activity between inmates is not sexual abuse. Too 
often , inmates suffer disciplinary action as a result of staff -on-inmate sexual abuse, when in fact 
staff members need to be the ones held accountable for such professional breaches. Punishing 
inmates for sexual contact with staff sends a dangerous message that staff -on-inmate sexual 
abuse is not taken seriously. It also serves as a serious deter rent to reporting abuse and suggests 
to inmates who are sexually abused by staff that it is their fault , disregarding the inherent power 
differential between staff and inmates. While inmates cannot legally consent to sexual contact 
with staff, consensual s exual activity between inmates is possible. Regardless of whether 
disciplinary action is taken in response to such activity , facilities should not waste limited

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 86 resources to investigate and file reports of abuse in response to consensual sexual activity 
between inmates that would not be considered sexual abuse in any other setting.  
 
Recommendation : Prevent staff  perpetrators of sexual abuse  from retaliating against 
reporting inmates by amending paragraph (e) as follows:  
The agency may discipline an inmate for sexual contact with staff only upon a 
finding that the staff member did not consent to such contact and that the inmate 
used force or threat of force against the staff member . 
 
While sexual assaults against staff members by inmates always should be tak en seriously, as 
written this standard allows a staff perpetrator to threaten an inmate or otherwise retaliate against 
a legitimate report of staff sexual misconduct by claiming that she or he did not consent to the 
activity. Requiring a finding of force o r threat of force before an inmate is punished recognizes 
the limited situations in which an inmate can manipulate the power dynamic to force staff to 
engage in sexual activity and provides a clear evidentiary standard for determining staff 
victimization .  
 
Recommendation : Add the following paragraph to  § 115.377 :  
In cases involving residents who engage in voluntary, though legally non -
consensual , sexual conduct with other residents, the disciplinary process shall take 
into account the voluntary nature of this conduct as a mitigating factor when 
determining what type of sanction, if any, should be imposed.  
 
Facilities need specific guidance on how to handle the disciplin ing of residents who engage in 
voluntary sexual conduct with other residents that , due t o the ages of those involved,  is not 
legally consensual . Without such guidance , facilities may fail to consider the voluntary nature of 
such conduct and harshly discipline these residents , often  based on homophobia or bias. 
Specifically, officials may use the standards to target LGBTI youth for harsh sanctions and even 
prosecution for engaging in sexual contact with similarly aged residents that is voluntary, but 
technically nonconsensual under state law. Unlike sexual activity between inmates and staff – in 
which there is an inherent power differential between the person locked up and the person 
supervising him or her – residents who are similar in age, but one or both are younger than the 
legal age of consent, are not faced with a power differential such t hat sexual conduct between 
two willing youth would be inherently abusive.  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 87 When sexual contact between similarly aged youth is voluntary but legally non -consensual due 
to a state‘s age of consent laws, the voluntary nature of the contact should be taken in to account 
in any disciplinary process. Unfortunately, many facilities fail to consider this . According to a 
report by the  BJS, in substantiated cases of reported sexual abuse, youth designated as 
perpetrators of voluntar y sexual contacts with other youth often received harsher sanctions than 
those found to be perpetrators of abusive sexual contacts.97 Facilities need additional guidance to 
discourage the use of harsh sanctions to punish youth who engage in voluntary, but legally non -
consensual, sexual conta ct. Specifically, facilities should not treat these youth as sexually 
aggressive, violent or deviant, or attempt to ―change‖ their sexual orientation. In addition, 
interventions for ―victims‖ and ―perpetrators‖ of voluntary sexual contact should not be mor e 
punitive than those for sexual contact that is forced, aggressive, or violent.  
 
X. Medical and Mental Health Care  
§ 115.81/381 Medical and mental health screenings  
While this standard is entitled ―medical and mental health screening,‖ the Department has  greatly 
weakened  the Commission‘s recommendations , remov ing the requirement that these screenings 
be conducted by  medical and mental health staff. As a result, this provision is, at best, redundant 
and, at least in the jail context, contradictory to the screening provision ( § 115.41/341).  
 
Recommendation:   Require that medical or mental health practitioners ask about 
sexual victimization and abusiveness by replacing paragraph (a) with the following:  
In facilities where medical or mental health practition ers conduct medical and 
mental health screenings as part of the intake or classification process, these 
practitioners shall ask inmates about prior sexual victimization and abusiveness 
during intake or classification screenings.  
 
The prisons and jails sta ndard on screening for risk of victimization and abusiveness (§ 115.41) 
and the juvenile standard on obtaining information from residents (§ 115.341) already require 
facilities to ask during intake and screening processes about the factors known to heighte n the 
risk of vulnerability and sexual abusiveness , including history of sexual victimization and

 88 abusiveness. Reiterating those two factors here, without any specification about who should be 
asking these questions, invites confusion as to why these facto rs, and not the others in the earlier 
provision, are emphasized in this way . 
 
Medical and mental health professionals  are the best equipped to ask sensitive but necessary 
questions about past victimization and abusiveness. These practitioners are accustome d to 
obtaining personal  information from patients, are able to identify physical or emotional injuries 
that may accompany such disclosures, and are in the best position  to assess what treatment 
services may be needed.  
 
The tremendous value of having medic al and mental health practitioners conduct  these inquirie s 
should outweigh any marginal costs incurred by this obligation.98 This is particularly true for 
prisons and large jails that employ or contract with full -time health practitioners. Agencies that 
regularly conduct medical and mental health screenings as part of their classification process 
have no legitimate basis to exclude these questions  from that process.  
 
Recommendation:  Require that medical and mental health screenings in jails, like 
those in p risons, ask about sexual abusiveness and sexual victimization.  In addition to 
adopting the language for paragraph (a) as detailed above,99 by deleting paragraphs (c) 
and (d), and amending paragraph (b) as follows:  
(b) If a n prisoner inmate discloses sexual victimization or abusiveness, whether it 
occurred in the an institutional setting or in the community, staff shall ensure that 
the inmate is offered a follow -up reception with a medical or mental  health 
practitioner within 14 days of the intake screening.  
 
The need for officials to know about an inmate‘s history of abusiveness is as important in the jail 
setting as it is in prisons. To house people awaiting trial and serving shorter sentences  safely , jail 
administrators need to separate likely victims from  likely perpetrators. Such determinations can 
only be made if information about victimization and abusiveness is obtained. The Department‘s 
decision to limit the inquiry that jails must make is dangerous and arbitrary.  As noted above, 
                                                 
98 IRIA, supra note 48, at 5 9. Notably, while relying on cost to justify this change, the Department also 
acknowledges that the Booz Allen Hamilton study considered the costs for this provision to be negligible. Id.  
99 If the Department does not adopt JDI‘s proposed language, then pa ragraph (a) should be amended to read ―All 
facilities  prisons shall ask inmates about prior sexual victimization and abusiveness during intake or classification 
screenings.‖    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 89 removing any inquiry about abusiveness for jails, while retaining it for prisons, is particularly 
hard to reconcile with § 115.41, which rightly requires both types of facilities to screen for these 
and other factors.  
 
§ 115.82/282/382 Access to emergency medical and mental h ealth services  
JDI applauds the Department for preserving the requirement that timely, unimpeded access to 
emergency treatment and crisis intervention services  be made available  free of charge to victims 
of sexual abuse in detention,  regardless of whether the victim names the abuser, and for further 
requiring  that victims be given  timely information about and access to pregnancy -related medical 
services and prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections.  
 
These basic measures will ensure the well -being of  prisoner rape survivors and address the 
significant public health concerns that arise from: untreated medical and psychiatric conditions; 
inability to access pregnancy -related services; and the spread of sexually transmitted infections .  
 
§ 115.83/283/383  Ongoing medical and mental health care  
As with the preceding standard, JDI applauds the Department for ensuring that female  survivors 
of rape in detention receive access to pregnancy tests and timely information and access to 
pregnancy -related services. R equiring a mental health evaluation of known abusers is also 
commendable, although this assessment and treatment should not be delayed for 60 days.  
 
Recommendation : Reduce the time period for evaluation and treatment of known 
inmate abusers in adult facili ties by amending § 115.83/283(d) as follows:  
All prisons shall conduct a mental health evaluation of all known inmate abusers 
within 60 14 days of learning of such abuse history and offer treatment when 
deemed appropriate by qualified mental health practit ioners.   
Reduce the time period for evaluation and treatment of known resident abusers in 
juvenile facilities by amending § 115.383(d) as follows:  
The facility shall conduct a mental health evaluation of all known resident abusers 
within 60 7 days of learn ing of such abuse history and offer treatment when deemed 
appropriate by qualified mental health practitioners.  
 
In standard § 115.81/381 ( b), agencies are given up to 14 days to provide inmates and residents 
who disclose sexual abusiveness access to a me ntal health practitioner. There is no justification 
for such a lengthy delay  in this provision. I n response to a recent  incident of sexual assault  in   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 90 particular,  abusiveness needs to be addressed promptly , with appropriate treatment offered as 
soon as poss ible.  
 
In juvenile facilities, the time frame  for conduct ing an assessment should be even shorter. The 
juvenile justice system was designed to provide a rehabilitative and therapeutic environment for 
youth; this mandate cannot be met if youth must  wait two  months for follow -up evaluations  after 
disclosures of abusiveness,  and even longer for treatment. Furthermore, juvenile residents are 
usually held in a facility for a significantly shorter period of time than  adult inmates. The 
National Commission on Corr ectional Healthcare (NCCHC) recommends that mental health 
assessments be conducted for new residents as soon as possible, but no later than seven  calendar 
days after admission to a facility.100 A seven -day window for assessing known resident abusers 
in juven ile facilities would be comparable to the NCCHC standards and more appropriate than 
the 60 -day window proposed in the Department‘s draft  standard .  
 
Question 27 : Does the standard that requires known abusers to receive a mental health 
evaluation within 60 days of learning the abuse has occurred provide adequate guidance 
regarding the scope of treatment that subsequently must be offered to such abusers? If 
not, how should it be revised?  
 
The proposed standard appropriately leaves open the scope of treatment to be offered to abusers. 
Currently, there is no validated treatment program for abusers that is uniformly recognized as a 
best practice. Sex offender treatment programs in the community have had limited success rates 
and minimal proof of effectiveness. Gi ven the state of the field, treatment for known incarcerated 
abusers will have to be based on an individualized assessment and treatment plan that conforms 
to local practices. Therefore, JDI believes that the Department appropriately defers to the 
expertis e of the practitioners at the facility.

 91 XI. Data Collection  
§ 115.86 /186/286/386  Sexual abuse incident reviews  
The Department laudably requires incident review teams to use information from past sexual 
abuse investigations in order to propose ways of pre venting future incidents. The proposed 
standard requires  these  teams to consider many important issues , including policies and 
procedures, staffing levels, monitoring technology, and limitations of the facility‘s physical 
plant. Specifying a dditional issue s to be considered  would further strengthen this provision.  
 
Recommendation :  Add “ gender identity ” to (c)(2), and the following provisions to that 
paragraph:  
 (6) Consider how additional or enhanced staff training opportunities could have 
prevented abus e and how it can prevent future abuse ; 
(7) Examine any barriers to reporting or filing grievances;  
 (8) Incorporate input from inmate victims and witnesses on how to improve the 
investigation and response process es; and  
 (9) Prepare a report of its finding s and any recommendations for improvement and 
submit such report to the facility head and PREA coordinator, if any.  
 
The Department‘s draft standard requires facilities to consider a number of factors related to the 
perpetrator and victim, including sexual  orientation. The final standard should also include 
consideration of gender identity in this list. In addition, facilities should learn from serious 
incidents such as sexual misconduct, and incorporate lessons learned to enhance or add trainings 
aimed at preventing, detecting, and responding to incidents. Barriers to reporting or filing 
grievances should also be considered. Finally, the incident review should include input from 
victims and witnesses on how to improve the investigation and response process es, as they may 
have particularly valuable insights as to how to prevent future misconduct.  
 
Recommendation : Add the following as paragraph (d):  
After receiving the report, the facility  head and PREA coordinator must determine 
which of the recommendations to carry out, and document benchmarks and a 
timeline for doing so  as an addendum to the report .  
 
To ensure that the results of an incident review translate into action, and to assist the auditor in 
measuring compliance with this provision, a plan of actio n should be documented that includes 
measurable benchmarks and a timeline.

 92 Recommendation : Add sexual harassment to paragraphs (a) and (c)(1).  
 
As noted previously, sexual harassment often serves as a precursor to sexual abuse. Agencies 
should review inc idents of harassment as part of their quality assurance process.  
 
§ 115.87 /187/287/387  Data collection  
JDI commends the Department for retaining the data collection provisions recommended by the 
Commission and requiring agencies to provide the prior year ‘s data to the Department upon 
request. Data collection should also encompass sexual harassment allegations.  
 
§ 115.88 /188/288/388  Data review for corrective action  
Collectively, the data collection provisions ensure that agencies gather the information nece ssary 
to learn about problems. The draft standards also recognize that agencies must take appropriate 
action based on that information. As written, though, the draft standard on corrective action only 
requires agencies to review aggregate  data.  
 
Recommend ation : Require corrective action based on data incident review s by 
amending paragraph (a) as follows:  
(a) Annually and after significant incidents,  Tthe agency shall review data and 
analyses collected and aggregated  pursuant to §  115.86 and § 115.87 in ord er to 
assess and improve the effectiveness of its sexual abuse prevention, detection, and 
response policies, practices, and training, including: …  
 
If agencies are only required to compile aggregate data on an annual basis, they may miss critical 
opportun ities to implement changes to practices, policies, staffing, training or monitoring. 
Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how facilities could ―tak[e] corrective action on an ongoing 
basis,‖ as the proposed standard currently requires, without reviewing indi vidual incidents as 
they arise. The revised language ensures that facilities take corrective action on an ongoing basis, 
reviewing both individual and aggregate data.

 93 XII. Audits  
§ 115.93 /193/293/393  Audits  
External scrutiny , and the transparency and accountability it brings,  are vitally important to the 
strength of any public institution – and corrections  facilities are no exception. Sound oversight, 
conducted by a qualified independent entity, can identify systemic problems and offer solutions. 
The Department faces the challenge of establishing regulations that will successfully translate the 
oversight fu nction of the standards into policy and practice across the country. Recognizing this 
important challenge, a number of advocacy organizations with experience in prison oversight, 
investigations of sexual abuse in detention, victims ‘ rights, and community r esponses to sexual 
violence,101 came together during the Department‘s public comment period to study this issue  
and suggest a practical and effective model to the Department .  
 
The principle guiding this group  was that a realistic, cost -effective monitoring system is critical 
to the standards‘ overall effectiveness and impact. Outside audits are needed to provide a 
credible, objective assessment of a facility‘s safety, and to identify problems that may be more 
readily apparent to an outsider than to an offici al working within the corrections system. 
Thorough audits will help prevent abuse and lead to safe  facilities , more effective prison 
management , and, ultimately, lower fiscal and human costs to the community .  
 
Recommendation:  Amend the audit provision as follows:  
(a) Agencies shall ensure that all facilities are audited on a triennial basis by an 
independent and qualified auditing body.  
(1) An audit shall be considered independent if it is conducted by :(1) A  a 
correctional monitoring body that is not par t of the agency but that is part of, or 
authorized by, the relevant State or local government; or  (2) An auditing entity 
that is within the agency but separate from its normal chain of command, such as 
an inspector general or ombudsperson who reports direc tly to the agency head or 
to the agency’s governing board; or (3)  O other outside individuals with relevant 
experience.

training in corrections, the dynamics of sexual violence,  and the investigation of 
sexual abuse, including interviewing victims.  
(b) No audit may be conducted by an auditor who has received financial 
compensation from the agency being audited within the three years prior to the 
agency’s retention of the auditor.   
(c) The agency shall not employ, contract with, or otherwise financially compensate 
the auditor for three years subsequent to the agency’s retention of the auditor, with 
the exception of contracting for subsequent audits.  
(d) All auditors shall be certi fied by the Department of Justice to conduct such 
audits, and shall be re -certified every three years.  
 (e) The Department of Justice shall prescribe methods governing the conduct of 
such audits, including provisions for reasonable inspections of faciliti es, review of 
documents, and interviews of staff and inmates. The Department of Justice also 
shall prescribe the minimum qualifications for auditors that incorporate sufficient 
training and/or expertise in corrections, the dynamics of sexual violence in 
detention, and the investigation of sexual abuse, including interviewing traumatized 
individuals . 
(f) The agency shall enable the auditor to make unannounced visits;  enter and tour 
all areas of a ll facilities , including contract facilities ; review documents;  and 
conduct private, confidential  interview s with staff and inmates , as deemed 
appropriate by the auditor , to conduct a comprehensive audit. The auditor must 
have access to all documents and any staff member or inmate , including inmates  
held in protective  custody or solitary confinement .  
(g) During each triennial auditing cycle, every facility shall be visited and have its 
policies, records, data , and other documents assessed for compliance with the 
standards ; however, the auditor may conduct more frequen t audits of any facility 
when the auditor determines that a visit is necessary as follow -up to a previous 
audit, has concerns about compliance with the standards, or based upon a request 
for assistance from the facility. All facilities must ensure that sta ff and inmates  are 
aware of the audit process and have reasonable means to contact the auditor 
confidentially . 
(h) The agency shall ensure that the auditor’s final report is provided to the 
Department of Justice, made available to staff and inmates , and  published on the 
agency’s website if it has one or is otherwise made readily available to the public.  
 
This model places central importance on realistic, cost -effective strategies to ensure that every 
facility is monitored. T he Department should endorse trie nnial audits of every facility as 
proposed by the Commission. Site visits are essential for an auditor meaningfully to assess 
whether complaints of sexual abuse are being appropriately filed and facilities are properly 
documenting, investigating, and  respo nding to acts of sexual abuse. JDI feels strongly that the 
Department must mandate triennial site visits to all facilities . If, however, the Department 
chooses to disregard that recommendation, it should  at the very least  establish a tiered system by   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 95 which  at least every three years all facilities are assessed for compliance with the standards 
through a review of policies, records, data and other documents , and contacts with facility 
administrators, staff , and inmates . Then the standard should also require that a  select number of 
facilities – chosen by the auditor for cause and  also by random selection – are visited for more 
comprehensive auditing in an ongoing manner.  
 
These basic reviews and visits must be performed by an entity that is structurally exter nal to the 
corrections agency being audited, and by individuals who have no recent relationship with the 
agency. The auditors must also have a victim -centered approach that incorporates expertise in 
both corrections and sexual violence.  
 
Aside from sugges ting that the Department will eventually establish guidelines for determining 
who may become a certified auditor and how PREA audits should be conducted, the proposed 
standard does not address these issues in any detail . Auditor certification and recertifi cation must 
ensure that the monitors are sufficiently qualified and independent. Government entities should 
only be considered independent if they are truly separate from the agency being audited – and do 
not answer to the agency head for funding or other resources. Expertise in addressing sexual 
violence, and especially  in working with survivors of sexual victimization, is just as important as 
expertise in corrections and , similarly , cannot be fully learned in a brief training course. Audit 
teams should  include a community member , to add to the integrity and accountability of the 
audits. This could be a professional from a partnering organization (such as the local rape crisis 
center or state sexual assault coalition) or a volunteer with appropriate backgro und and 
commitmen t. Further, members of the audit teams must be aware of relevant legal requirements, 
including civil rights law.  
 
PREA monitors must have free and unfettered access to all facilit ies. Such access must include 
the right to make unannounced visits and to enter and tour all areas of any facility, including 
contract facilities.102 Unannounced visits are the cornerstone of effective corrections monitoring. 
Such access does not mean that visits will be inconsistent with security needs or that a ver y brief

 96 wait for auditors to comply with security demands, such as facility counts, may not occur. 
However, as the A merican Bar Association‘s S tandards for the Treatment of Prisoners note: 
―security concerns do not provide a justification for disallowing u nannounced inspections, nor do 
rationales related to convenience of correctional staff.‖103 Auditors must also be permitted to 
review all documents, be able to copy any documents (including documents related to pending 
investigations), and take those copies off-site for review . Similarly, they should be able to 
conduct private, confidential interviews with staff and prisoners, including prisoners in 
protective custody or solitary confinement.104  
 
The agency must ensure that there are accessible mechanisms for inmates and staff to engage in 
confidential communication with the auditor (both on -site and via mail/telephone), and that 
mechanisms are in place to ward off retaliation for contacting  or communicating  with the 
auditor. In addition to making themselves av ailable to staff and inmates, auditor s must publicly 
advertise their work and solicit input from the community before and after facility visits as well 
as in response to their reports.  
 
In each audit, the monitor should be responsible for independently ver ifying that the facility is 
making reasonable progress toward achieving compliance with the PREA standards and 
thereafter maintaining such compliance. Each monitor‘s report shall describe the steps taken to 
analyze conditions and assess compliance with the  standards, including documents reviewed and 
individuals interviewed (unless confidentiality is requested), and the factual basis for each of the 
monitor‘s findings. The monitor‘s reports should also include specific recommendations for 
actions needed to b ring the facility into compliance with the PREA standards.  
  
The monitor‘s findings should be publicly available – except for private information (such as 
victims ‘ names) – to fulfill the transparency and accountability expectations of such oversight. In 
addition to providing hard copies to the facility law libraries and to any inmate who requests one, 
the reports should be posted on the websites of the auditor, the agency, the Department , and the

parties are likely to look for them.  
 
Recognizing the enforcement role the Department will play in any audit scheme and the need to 
determine the meaning of ―full compliance‖ with the standards, JDI believe s that  the Departm ent 
should use the multi -tiered approach that it employs in other contexts, whereby s ubstantial 
compliance  means compliance with most components of all of the provisions , partial compliance 
is established when the monitor identifies gaps in compliance that  go beyond anecdotal incidents, 
technicalities , or temporary factors , and non-compliance is a designation of last resort when a 
facility refuses to establish and/or implement an action plan to address gaps that have been 
previously identified.  
 
Questions 28-31:  
 Should audits be conducted at set intervals, or should audits be conducted only for 
cause, based upon a reason to believe that a particular facility or agency is 
materially out of compliance with the standards? If the latter, how should such a for -
cause determination be structured?  
 If audits are conducted for cause, what entity should be authorized to determine that 
there is reason to believe an audit is appropriate, and then to call for an audit to be 
conducted? What would be the appropriate standa rd to trigger such an audit 
requirement?  
 Should all facilities be audited or should random sampling be allowed for some or all 
categories of facilities in order to reduce burdens while ensuring that all facilities 
could be subject to an audit?  
 Is there a b etter approach to audits other than the approaches discussed above?  
 
While ―for cause‖ audits have some value, oversight cannot rely exclusively on this method. 
Audits based on cause do not serve the important preventative role of identifying problems 
before they become  serious  – one of the greatest cost savings potentially derived from the 
standards. Moreover, while criteria for establishing cause can be developed (and suggestions are 
provided below), no standard is fool proof. Reporting is inherently unre liable ;105 some facilities 
may suppress information, such as grievances and other reports, to avoid audits, and facilities 
may have systemic problems that directly affect the potential for measuring cause (such as poor 
recordkeeping or insufficient access to  reporting mechanisms and the auditor). Systems with

 98 these types of deficiencies would benefit tremendously from random audits, but are unlikely to 
be identified as requiring  for cause audits.  
 
Despite the limitations of relying exclusively on cause to det ermine where to audit, for cause 
audits should be part of the auditing structure. Facilities with known problems are 
unquestionably in need of outside guidance. Mandatory audits of these facilities would help 
identify problems and realistic solutions while  providing accountability.  
 
A qualified and independent auditor is in the best position  to determine when an audit is 
appropriate. As the value of audits come s from their external nature, allowing corrections 
administrators to choose which facilities  to au dit would undercut the important oversight role of 
the auditor. Officials who fear accountability in poorly performing facilities may avoid 
subjecting those facilities to audits. Even where officials seek outside monitoring to address 
known dangers, they a re unlikely to be able to identify facilities that may have problems that are 
unnoticed by staff.  
 
The appropriate standard for the auditor to use in determining when cause has been met depends 
on the oversight structure established – specifically, the ext ent to which this structure relies 
exclusively on cause in determining who to audit. If the Department adopts a hybrid structure 
that includes both random and for cause audits, then the standard for cause can be fairly lenient – 
affording the auditor suffi cient discretion to assess what triggering events would amount to 
cause. However, if random audits are not being conducted, then the cause determination must be 
more inclusive.  
 
Triggering events for determining that cause exists for a full audit should in clude a range of 
justifications, including but not limited to:  
(a) agency requests for assistance;  
(b) documentation of existing problems or incidents;  
(c) reasonable suspicion of any instance of staff -on-inmate abuse, as well as inmate -on-
inmate abuse that appears to be the result of a deficiency in staff efforts to prevent or 
respond to abuse;  
(d) follow -ups to previous audits to assess implementation of corrective action plans; and     Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 99 (e) an auditor‘s review of documents at a facility or contacts from inmates or staff tha t 
indicates possible non -compliance with the standards.  
 
In order to implement the for cause audit system effectively, the auditing entity must be able to 
gather information and intelligence from various sources, including:  media reports; facility self -
reports; prisoner complaints; family/friend/community concerns; contacts with advocacy groups 
and other citizen action efforts; and national reporting and research bodies.  
 
While the Department requests information for establishing for cause audits, JDI and i ts partners 
urge it to mandate that every facility be visited by the auditor at least every three years. Site 
visits are vitally important because external review s of documents concerning sexual abuse 
simply are not sufficient to assess compliance with the  standards. As the Commission amply 
documented, many inmates and staff are extremely reluctant to report sexual abuse; if a 
complaint is not filed, there will be no documents for the auditor to review. Unfortunately, non -
disclosure of sexual abuse may be g reatest at the very facilities where non -compliance exist s, 
due to intimidation or violence. Similarly, it is difficult to assess the adequacy of investigations 
without access to the complainants or witnesses. Finally, it is near ly impossible to determine 
whether there is a culture of abuse or intimidation at a facility without a site visit. Conditions 
within a system can vary dramatically from one facility to the next ; only by visiting each facility 
can the monitor fully assess whether inmates are safe.  
  
However, if full audits at every facility are not approved by the Department, JDI urges -- as a 
significantly less desirable alternative -- the Department to establish a tiered system that includes 
some external monitoring of all facilities with full audit s at a selected number. At least every 
three years, all facilities should, at a minimum, be assessed for compliance with the standards 
through auditor reviews of  their policies, records, data and other documents , and remote 
contacts with facility administ rators, staff , and inmates. A hybrid of random and for cause audits 
would provide attention and accountability to the most deficient facilities while keeping all 
institutions ‗on their toes‘ to maintain the most effective  policies and practices.

 100 Every fac ility should also submit a self -assessment of compliance with the standards to the 
auditing entity on a yearly basis. Doing so  will ensure that corrections administrators are 
including the standards in their routine prison management exercises. It will als o provide an 
ongoing source of information for the auditing entity.  
 
Question 32 : To what extent, if any, should agencies be able to combine a PREA audit 
with an audit performed by an accrediting body or with other types of audits?  
 
PREA audits can be comb ined with other audits, but only if they are conducted by auditors who 
have sufficient independence from the agency and who are qualified with expertise both about 
corrections and sexual violence. Traditional audits – conducted solely by corrections 
practi tioners and generally linked to voluntary fee -based accreditation – will not suffice.  
 
The importance of independence cannot be overstated. Unless the review is conducted by an 
entity that is structurally external to the corrections agency being audited, and by individuals 
who have no recent relationship with the agency, the integrity of the audit will be compromised . 
To ensure sufficient autonomy, the auditing entity should be appointed or contracted for a fixed 
term by the governor/chief executive or the  legislature – not the corrections agency. Some 
inspector s general and other public monitoring bodies are sufficiently independent, but entities 
that report to the head of the agency being audited (as permitted by subsection of  
§ 115.93 /193/293/393(a)(2))  are by default not qualified as PREA auditors .106 Entities that 
ultimately answer to the head of the Department can easily be pressured to minimize or ignore 
certain concerns, or be prevented from fully examining conditions through the allocation of 
resourc es.  
 
Ideally, audits would be conducted by teams that include at least one corrections practitioner 
(who may also be involved in other types of audits of corrections facilities) and at least one 
expert in sexual violence prevention and response from the c ommunity (who may be involved in 
other audits pertaining to federal funds, as required by VOCA and VAWA). An effective PREA 
                                                 
106 This distinction is consist ent with the ABA‘s oversight resolution and its Treatment of Prisoners Standards . See 
American Bar Association , supra  note 46, at Sta ndard 23 -11.3(a) (external monitoring and inspection); AMERICAN 
BAR ASSOCIATION , RES. 104B  KEY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EFFECTI VE MONITORING OF CORRECTIONAL AND 
DETENTION FACILITIES  (2008) .    Just Detention International

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 101 auditor must also have prior expertise and/or training in both sexual violence dynamics and the 
corrections environment. The balance  between prior expertise and current training will vary, but 
being a retired corrections official, by itself, is not a sufficient qualification. Without state 
certification in rape crisis counseling, a corrections -only monitoring entity is unlikely to be 
aware of best practices in the community – many of which require only slight modification to 
account for the unique concerns in the corrections environment. More importantly, only a crisis 
counseling professional will have sufficient expertise in gathering information from traumatized 
individuals and picking up cues of possible concerns that inmates and others may not feel 
comfortable sharing.  
 
Question 33 : To what extent, if any, should the wording of any of the substantive 
standards be revised in order to facilitate a determination of whether a jurisdiction is in 
compliance with that standard?  
 
The nature of the PREA standards, by necessity, is primarily qualitative. Quantitative indicators 
help measure compliance but will not sufficiently measure the overa ll effectiveness of prevention 
and response efforts. As a result, auditors must be provided with a fair amount of discretion to 
determine compliance based on overall effectiveness and ultimately, the safety of inmates at 
individual facilities.  
 
The abilit y of the auditor to make these determinations, however, will be greatly enhanced by 
requiring further documentation of agency efforts. In particular, documenting facility efforts to 
collaborate with outside entities (§  115.21/121/221/321  and § 115.22/222/3 22), to avoid cross -
gender searches and viewing of inmates in states of undress ( § 115.14/114/214/314), to limit the 
use of involuntary segregation as a means to protect vulnerable and victimized individuals (§  
115.43/243  and § 115.66/366), and to follow -up on the recommendations arising from data 
incident reviews (§ 115. 86/186/286/386 ) will provide concrete deliverables that the auditors can 
measure and review.  
 
Questions 34 -35:  
 How should ―full compliance‖ be defined in keeping with the considerations s et forth 
in the above discussion?  
 To what extent, if any, should audits bear on determining whether a State is in full 
compliance with PREA?    Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 102  
Immediate and absolute compliance with all PREA standards is unlikely to be achieved by all 
systems at all times, and both the standards as a whole and the audit provisions in particular 
should be seen as a means of trouble -shooting problems and identifying solutions. As a result, 
the definition of ―full compliance‖ deserves a nuanced approach. In other contexts, the 
Department uses a multi -tiered approach that would be equally effective here. This approach 
defines different types of compliance to be determined  by the monitor, including the following: 
substantial compliance,  meaning compliance with most components of a ll provisions; partial 
compliance,  resulting when the monitor identifies gaps in compliance that go beyond anecdotal 
incidents, technicalities or temporary factors; and non-compliance,  being a designation  of last 
resort when a facility refuses to establish  and/or implement an action plan to address gaps that 
have previously been identified.  
 
The goal of the standards is to ensure the safety of inmates . Legitimate stakeholder s would not 
want corrections agencies to lose federal funding  except in extraordinar y circumstances . 
Moreover, relying on the penalty of lost funding – without lesser sanctions available – would 
create a strong disincentive among auditors to make a finding of non-compliance. Through a 
multi -tiered system, agencies can have ample opportuni ty to correct deficiencies, with alternative 
sanctions providing pressure (and possibly assistance) for coming into compliance, and the loss 
of funds can be considered a last resort.  
  
In line with the ABA‘s standards for external monitoring and inspection , correction s facilities 
should be required to respond in a public document (that redacts any confidential or security -
related information) to the findings of the auditing entity, to develop corrective action plans to 
address identified problems, and perio dically to document compliance with recommendations or 
explain non -compliance.107 As mentioned above, follow -up for cause audits should assess and 
report on agency efforts to address identified problems and make suggestions for continuing 
facility improvemen t and compliance .

  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 103 Auditors should be required to make their reports publicly available, and the agency, staff and 
inmates within the facility, and the general public should have an opportunity to respond. When 
a facility is found to be out of compliance (in full or in part), it must develop an action plan that 
sufficiently addresses the concerns raised in the report – after which compliance with the action 
plan must be at least as decisive as the initial audit in assessing full compliance with PREA.  
 
Dete rmining full compliance must incorporate the assessment of an outside monitor in order to 
have any meaning. In this respect, the audits should play a crucial role. However, they need not 
be the only indicia relied upon. While not conducting the reviews its elf, the Department should 
verify that each inspection was properly conducted by a qualified monitor, and that corrective 
action plans are both implemented and monitored.  
 
Additional suggested standard (youth in adult facilities)  
Questions  36-37: 
 Should th e final rule include a standard that governs the placement of juveniles in 
adult facilities?  
 If so, what should the standard require, and how should it interact with the current 
JJDPA requirements and penalties mentioned above?  
 
The Department should creat e a standard that protects youth in adult facilities.108 Because of the 
stage of development and cognitive and social immaturity  of adolescents , they have 
characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to abuse.  Notably , the Commission stated 
that yo uth incar cerated with adults are at the highest risk for sexual abuse.109 Adult facilities 
housing children and adolescents face a dangerous dilemma , as they have to choos e between 
housing youth in the general adult population where they are at substantial risk of sexual abuse 
or housing youth in segregated settings that cause or exacerbate mental health problems. Neither 
option is safe and appropriate for youth, nor a good practice for corrections agencies that are ill-
equipped to address the unique needs o f minors.  
 
                                                 
108 Specific language for such a standard has been developed by the Campaign for Youth  Justice, and provided to the 
Department in a sign -on letter. JDI supports the language proposed in that letter.

 104 The Department should prohibit the placement of youth in adult jails and prisons as a way to 
reduce the sexual abuse of youth. At a minimum, the standards should require that jurisdictions 
create a presumption that all youth will be housed in j uvenile facilities and can only be 
transferred to an adult facility after a hearing is conducted to determine whether the interests of 
justice require detention in a prison or jail.  
 
These changes would protect all youth under the age of 18 held in adult facilities, and therefore 
go beyond the statutory requirements of the existing Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention Act (JJDPA).110 To the extent that youth are currently housed in adult facilities in 
violation of the JJDPA, these facilities should be  found out of compliance with both the JJDPA 
and the PREA  standards . Facilities housing youth in adult facilities in violation of this 
recommended approach, but that are not in violation of the JJDPA, should be found out of 
compliance with PREA.

 105 C. REGUL ATORY QUESTIONS  
 
Questions 38 -41:  
 Has the Department appropriately determined the baseline level of sexual abuse in 
correctional settings for purposes of assessing the benefit and cost of the proposed 
PREA standards?  
 Are there any reliable, empirical sour ces of data, other than the BJ S studies 
referenced in the IRIA, that would be appropriate to use in determining the baseline 
level of prison sexual abuse? If so, please cite such sources and explain whether and 
why they should be used to supplement or repl ace the BJS data.  
 Are there reliable methods for measuring the extent of underreporting and 
overreporting in connection with BJS’s inmate surveys?  
 Are there sources of data that would allow the Department to assess the prevalence of 
sexual abuse in lockups  and community confinement facilities? If so, please supply 
such data. In the absence of such data, are there available methodologies for 
including sexual abuse in such settings in the overall estimate of baseline prevalence?  
 
As the Department appears to recognize, assessing the prevalence of sexual abuse  in detention 
facilities  is remarkably difficult. As is also the case  in the community, there are numerous 
reasons why a survivor of sexual abuse  in detention  is unlikely to disclose such abuse – including  
shame, guilt, fear of retaliation , fear of not being believed, and the interruption in cognitive 
functioning that is part of a normal trauma reaction . For incarcerated survivors , however,  these 
concerns are magnified. People raped behind bars cannot escap e their attackers and have 
legitimate fears about trusting officials who failed to protect them  (and who, in many cases, are 
the perpetrators or colleagues of the perpetrators) . Most prisoner rape survivors endure multiple 
attacks, and many of those who ar e brave enough to report sexual abuse end up in punitive 
conditions such as segregation , while their perpetrators are not held accountable.  
 
The Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS) is the foremost expert on corrections -related data 
collection and analysis,  and the data from the  BJS‘ s inmate and resident surveys are the best 
available source for determining the baseline level of sexual abuse  behind bars . Sexual violence 
is one of the least reported crimes, in the community and behind bars. In light of the sh ame and 
stigma  associated with this crime , fear of retaliation, and other disincentives to reporting, reports 
lodged with officials simply do not capture the extent of sexual violence in detention. (This is 
also why  multiple reporting mechanisms  are necess ary, including external reporting options .) 
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 106 The BJS‘s inmate and resident surveys are the most comprehensive, credible stud ies to date t hat 
measure the prevalence of sexual abuse behind bars. However, as the Department notes, the 
snapshot n ature of  the BJ S reports – reflecting only the inmates and residents detained on the 
given day that each survey was conducted – do not reflect the total number  of inmates and 
residents incarcerated over the course of a year. While there are no absolute data on the total 
number of individuals in  detention over the course of a year , the Department makes the best 
available flow adjustment based on the BJS calculations.  
 
None of these data include lockups or community corrections, making even the best estimates by 
the Depart ment too low. JDI knows of no credible accounting even of the number of such 
facilities or the number of inmates in lockups and community confinement, let alone a study of 
sexual violence against these individuals. The Department  should gather such informa tion, as a 
matter of urgency. I n community confinement facilities, the BJS can conduct surveys similar to 
those already conducted in corrections facilities . Determining prevalence in lockups is especially 
difficult because of the rapid turnover of inmate p opulations there,  but preliminary information 
could be gathered by incorporating questions about sexual assault while in police custody into 
both the prisons and jails surveys (to capture people who were ultimately incarcerated) and the 
National Crime Victimization  Survey (to capture people who were released).  Until these data are 
gathered, however, it is unclear how fully to account for these facilities‘ victims, except to note 
that the Department‘s estimate of victimization – like its other calculations – is overly 
conservative.  
 
Furthermore, t he Department‘s focus on the number of victims, rather than the number of 
incidents , minimizes the severity of the problem. In the BJS adult inmate survey , between one -
half and two -thirds of those who reported being sexually abused reported  that it happened more 
than once , with 15 to 40 percent c iting six or more incidents.111 In juvenile facilities, 81 percent 
of youth who reported sexual abuse by other residents and 88 percent of youth who reported staff 
sexual abuse said it happened more than once , with 46 and 49 percent , respectively, saying  they

 107 experienced  six or more incidents.112 As each incident brings its own fiscal, health -related, and 
moral costs , as well as implications for institutional security, the Departme nt‘s calculations 
should account for the substantially higher number of incidents than victims .  
 
While the BJS data constitute the best available source of empirical data, several smaller studies 
confirm the BJS findings and provide useful additional qual itative analysis.  Cindy Struckman -
Johnson and David Struckman -Johnson surveyed Midwestern prisoners about their experience of 
sexual victimization over the entire course of their incarceration.113 In men‘s prisons, they found 
that nearly one in five inmates had been sexually assaulted while in prison. The rates varied 
dramatically in women‘s facilities, with one in four inmates being victimized at the worst 
institutions .  
 
Researchers from the Center for Evidence -Based Corrections, in a study commissioned by the 
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, surveyed inmates in California men‘s 
prisons about their experience of inmate -on-inmate sexual abuse.114 In addition to providing 
overall data about inmate -on-inmate abuse in these facilities, whic h conform to the BJS‘s 
findings, this study also surveyed all transgender women in the state‘s men‘s facilities, in an 
effort to gain insight into the prevalence and trends for this highly vulnerable population. In this 
survey, approximately 59 percent of transgender inmates reported having been sexually assaulted 
by another inmate during their incarceration, a rate that was more than 13 times higher than that 
of the inmate population overall. The BJS surveys did not ask about gender identity so they do 
not provide comparable data.  
 
No survey can fully overcome the reality that victimized inmates w ill not report abuse out of 
shame, because it was too painful , or out of fear that the report will not remain anonymous . JDI 
believes that the BJS studies most li kely undercount the victims of sexual abuse in detention, 
perhaps significantly . Nonetheless, JDI urges the Department to defer to the BJS in its approach

 108 to addressing under -reporting and over -reporting , both because no good ways have yet been 
discovered to establish by how much the surveys undercount the true prevalence of sexual abuse 
in detention, and because following the BJS‘s lead in this matter seems appropriately 
conservative . The surveys were designed to discourage false reporting , and took severa l 
precautionary measures to address over -reporting and under -reporting beyond those employed by 
government surveyors measuring sexual violence in the community.115 The anony mous nature of 
the survey, which was established to protect inmates who were too afra id to report abuse to 
officials, also precluded any p ossibility that they could secur e a transfer or other personal gain 
from false reporting . Likewise , the BJS surveys provided  no opportunity to name perpetrators or 
otherwise expect that an officer would be penalized in any way based on answers in th e surveys. 
While some inmates may have fabricated their reports, as many officials fear, it is much more 
likely that people who were victimized decided not to disclose their abuse . In sum, relying on the 
BJS da ta without accounting for under -reporting and over -reporting will provide a conservative 
estimate of the overall number of victims, in line with the conservatism of the Department‘s 
other calculations.  
 
Questions 42 -44:  
 Has the Department appropriately ad justed the conclusions of studies on the value of 
rape and sexual abuse generally to account for the differing circumstances posed by 
sexual abuse in confinement settings?  
 Are there any academic studies, data compilations, or established methodologies that  
can be used to extrapolate from mental health costs associated with sexual abuse in 
community settings to such costs in confinement settings? Has the Department 
appropriately estimated that the cost of mental health treatment associated with 
                                                 
115 Three leading surveys are : the BJS‘s National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), available at 
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245  (last accessed March 14, 2011);  the National Institute of 
Justice‘s Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women Report, available at 
http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/183781.pdf  (last accessed March 27, 2011); and the FBI‘s Uniform Crime Report, 
available at http://www.fbi.gov/about -us/cjis/uc r/ucr  (last accessed March 14, 2011) . The NCVS asks about crimes 
at a particular household in the past six months and is able to compare the answers from the previous set of surveys 
to make sure that respondents are not reporting any incidents that occurr ed outside the six-month time frame. The 
NIJ report is generated by phone interviews with individuals at randomly chosen households, without any specific 
checks on under -reporting or over -reporting. The FBI report relies solely on crimes reported to law en forcement and 
therefore undoubtedly reflects  under -reporting. In addition to being an anonymous computer -based survey without 
any means to name the perpetrator, the inmate and resident surveys include ―latent class measures‖ to assess 
reliability. All inte rviews are also examined for interview error, interviews completed in too short a time, incomplete 
interviews, and inconsistent response patterns –any survey with any of these  concerns is excluded from the data set.

 109 sexual abuse in confinement settings is twice as large as the corresponding costs in 
community settings?  
 Has the Department correctly identified the quantifiable costs of rape and sexual 
abuse? Are there other costs of rape and sexual abuse that are capable of 
quantifi cation, but are not included in the Department’s analysis?  
 
The Department relies on the best available research to calculate a unit of cost for rape, its first 
category of sexual abuse, and consistent with its general approach makes conservative 
adjustmen ts to account for the confinement setting. (As discussed in questions 47 -48, below, JDI 
believes that the Department‘s adjustments  for other types of sexual abuse are more problematic 
and well below even conservative estimates.) As the Department notes, me ntal illness and 
sexually transmitted infections are more prevalent in detention than they are in the community 
and therefore will generate greater associated costs. While the Department chose to double the 
estimated costs in the community, prevalence rate s in detention settings suggest a more dramatic 
multiplication: mental illness is estimated to be four to six times as prevalent in corrections 
settings as in the community,116 and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are estimated 
at 2.4 to 20 time s the rates in the community.117 Moreover, substance abuse and suicide acts are 
also more prevalent among detained populations, and these figures should likewise be adjusted 
upward. The repeated rapes that incarcerated victims often endure will also require higher 
treatment costs than would be suggested by general estimates from the community. In light of 
these distinctions, it is not surprising that, in the litigation context, much higher costs have 
already been estimated for detention settings. For example,  Terry Kupers, MD, a leading 
psychiatric expert on sexual abuse in detention, estimates that, d epending on the severity of 
emotional problems arising from an assault, the psychotherapy and group therapy sessions 
needed could total $26,000 per year for two to three years.118

The Department also presumes that there will be no lost work/productivity for the victim or 
earning loss for the perpetrator. While prisoner rape survivors by and large do not generate any 
real income while incarcerated, the trauma of th eir abuse is likely to damage their reentry 
significantly, including their ability to secure and maintain employment. This expense may be 
lower than for currently employed members of society, but it is far from insignificant. The 
Department must also consi der that a former inmate who is debilitated by the trauma of rape is 
likely to require assistance from public resources, such as community mental health providers, 
Medicaid, housing programs, or food stamps, which increase the long -term costs beyond 
incarc eration. With respect to perpetrator earning loss, in the majority of cases, as the BJS has 
confirmed, perpetrators of sexual abuse in detention are staff member who should lose their jobs. 
Even in cases of inmate -on-inmate assaults, if the perpetrator is prosecuted and receives 
additional prison time, there will be further earning loss.  
 
Consistent with available  research, the Department only examined the costs  of sexual abuse in 
detention  to the victim – without factoring in expenses incurred by the agen cy and by society. In 
the free -world context, this makes sense: the government bears significantly fewer costs in 
responding to the abuse of someone who is not in its charge, and few law enforcement or other 
government official s would seriously suggest tha t efforts to combat sexual abuse in the 
community must be subjected to a cost -benefit analysis like the one here. There are, however, 
significant costs for the agency and society when a sexual assault happens in detention ; these 
expenses can be quantified and should be factored into the analysis. For example, agencies incur 
costs related to security breaches, staff turnover, grievances and investigations, increased use of 
expensive single -celled beds (for victims or perpetrators), and increased security for  
transportation to the hospital and/or another facility. Society also incurs quantifiable costs with 
                                                                                                                                                             
Kupers emphasizes that damage from sexual abuse is long-term and more severe than generally imagined by courts 
or mental health professionals, and that these costs do not ―erase‖ the damage but provide a starting -point for 
estimating dollar  amounts. Email from Terry Kupers, MD, to Linda McFarlane, Deputy Executive Director, Just

 111 respect to prosecutions for prisoner rape, increased reliance on public assistance by traumatized 
inmates upon release, and additional incarceration costs for sentenced perpetrators and for 
victims who are too traumatized to reintegrate successfully into the community. This last point 
deserves emphasis: former inmates are returned to prison every year in enormous numbers for 
technical violations of the terms  of their parole – failing a drug test, for example, or missing an 
appointment with a parole officer, or failing to maintain employment. But all of these ―failures‖ 
would, in fact, be entirely typical symptoms of Rape Trauma Syndrome (about which, however,  
the Department‘s proposed standards do not require that parole officers be trained).  
 
Question s 45-46:  
 Should the Department adjust the ―willingness to pay‖ figures on which it relies 
(developed by Professor Mark Cohen for purposes of valuing the benefit  to society of 
an avoided rape) to account for the possibility that some people may believe sexual 
abuse in confinement facilities is a less pressing problem than it is in society as a 
whole, and might therefore think that the value of avoiding such an inc ident in the 
confinement setting is less than the value of avoiding a similar incident in the non -
confinement setting? Likewise, should the Department adjust these figures to take into 
account the fact that in the general population the vast majority of se xual abuse 
victims are female, whereas in the confinement setting the victims are overwhelmingly 
male? Are such differences even relevant for purposes of using the contingent 
valuation method to monetize the cost of an incident of sexual abuse? If either 
adjustment were appropriate, how (or on the basis of what empirical data) would the 
Department go about determining the amount of the adjustment?   
 Has the Department appropriately accounted for the increased costs to the victim and 
to society when the victi m is a juvenile? Why or why not?  
 
Federal policy must recognize that all sexual abuse is equally unacceptable, regardless of the 
victim‘s gender, custody status or criminal history. If anything, the heightened responsibility of 
the government to protect pe ople in its charge should warrant a higher ―willingness to pay‖ 
figure for people in detention than for people in free society. Minimizing the cost of 
victimization of inmates due to a lack of public sympathy for incarcerated people is bad policy – 
and und ermines the purpose of PREA, which is to ensure that prisoner rape is taken seriously. It 
is particularly problematic to do so when considering that 95 percent of inmates eventually return 
to their communities, and bring their trauma and abuse with them.  
   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 112 While all adult victims must be viewed equally, the longer life expectancy of juveniles and the 
impact of abuse on their healthy development do warrant increased cost estimates. Again, the 
Department‘s estimates are overly conservative here, as they do no t clearly account for the 
impact that sexual abuse has on the long -term physical, emotional, and mental development and 
health of a child, nor any resulting social difficulties, cognitive dysfunction, or participation in 
high risk behaviors – outcomes that  have been shown to affect children who experience sexual 
abuse.119  
 
Increasing the National Institute of Justice‘s adult estimates by 33 percent to serve as the upper 
bound cost for youth victims is also too conservative. A recent study employing the willi ngness -
to-pay (WTP) methodology found that society has a higher WTP for reduc ing child abuse  than 
abuse of adults .120 To calculate the costs, the researchers doubled the costs identified in the NIJ 
study after updating to 2007 dollars.121 The Department should  do the same, and double the 
lower bound figure  (which based on the current figure of  $275,000  would increase the upper 
bound from $400,000 to $550,000) .  
 
The decision to count all incidents of staff -on-youth contact as nonconsensual activity, given that 
all staff sexual activity with youth is inherently coerced or pressured and harmful to the youth 
and society as a whole, is sound but, as discussed below (in questions 47 -48), the value assigned 
to sexual assault involving pressure/coercion is too low.  
 
                                                 
119 According to a  2007 study by Prevent Child Abuse America, children who have been sexually abused are more 
likely to experience: poor physical health (e.g., chronic fatigue, altered immune function, hypertension, sexually 
transmitted diseases, obesity); poor emotional an d mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, eating disorders, suicidal 
thoughts and attempts, post -traumatic stress disorder); social difficulties (e.g., insecure attachments t o caregivers, 
which may lead to difficulties in developing trusting relationship s with peers and adults later in life); cognitive 
dysfunction (e.g., deficits in attention, abstract reasoning, language development, and problem -solving skills, which 
ultimately may affect academic achievement and school performance); high -risk health beh aviors (e.g., a higher 
number of lifetime sexual partners, younger age at first voluntary intercourse, teen pregnancy, alcohol and substance 
abuse); and behavioral problems (e.g., aggression, delinquency, and adult criminality). CHING -TUNG WANG & JOHN

 113 Questions 47 -48:  
 Are there available methodologies, or available data from which a methodology can 
be developed, to assess the unit value of avoiding a nonconsensual sexual act 
involving pressure or coercion? If so, please supply them. Is the Department’s 
estimate of this unit value ( i.e., 20% of the value of a forcible rape) appropriately 
conservative?   
 Are there available methodologies, or available data from which a methodology can 
be developed, to assess the unit value of avoiding an ―abusive sexual con tact between 
inmates,‖ as defined in the IRIA? If so, please supply them. Is the Department’s 
estimate of this unit value (i.e., $375 for adult inmates and $500 for juveniles) 
appropriately conservative? Would a higher figure be more appropriate? Why or wh y 
not? 
 
In trying to extrapolate costs for sexual assault involving pressure/coercion, abusive sexual 
contacts, and willing sex with staff, the Department grossly underestimates the harm and 
resulting costs of these forms of abuse, well below even its other already conservative estimates. 
Beyond ignoring the costs to the agency and society that are not factored into the Department‘s 
analysis (detailed in our response to Questions 42 -44), the Department estimates the unit value of 
avoiding nonconsensual sexu al acts by relying on an arbitrary percentage of its estimated unit 
value for rape and it assigns a unit value for abusive sexual contact without explanation. These 
unit value determinations are dangerously low.  
 
With respect to sexual assault involving p ressure or coercion, the Department presumes that the 
cost is a mere one -fifth of the cost of a forcible rape because there is typically no physical injury. 
However, mental trauma and loss of quality of life account for 85 percent of the Department‘s 
estim ate of the cost of forcible rape, and these expenses will be essentially the same  in situations 
that do not involve force . Physical injury and level of violence are not the primary factors in 
determining the level of trauma; the perception of threat is als o key.122 The nature of 
incarcerat ion, the absence of confidential support services, and the complete lack of control over 
one‘s environment, including the people within it, cause incarcerated victims to feel especially 
helpless in the aftermath of any kind of assault. Moreover, regardless of the level of force  used,

   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 114 the pre-detention history of victimization prevalent among incarcerated victims123 makes any 
incident of abuse likely to trigger prior trauma.124 
 
The values assigned by the Department for ―abusive s exual contact‖ – $375  for an adult and 
$500 for a juvenile – are also unreasonably low. It is unclear how the Department arrived at th ese 
number s, as its calculations in Table 3 place suffering and lost quality of life for sexual abuse at 
$386. As is true for the estimate of costs associated with  nonconsensual sexual acts, this estimate 
completely ignores the trauma resulting from these incidents , and the resulting mental health 
costs. It also presumes that victims endured one incident, when in fact abusive  sexual contact 
often forms part of an ongoing and escalating pattern that results in increasing emotional harm. 
Likewise, agencies must be required fully to investigate, adjudicate , and sanction this form of 
abuse, and while the costs of so doing may not rise to the level appropriate for incidents 
requiring a full forensic medical examination, they are likely to be significant nonetheless.  
 
Finally, while the Department appropriately treats willing sex with staff as nonconsensual sexual 
assault in youth fa cilities, its determination that in adult facilities the cost of this abuse is less 
than two percent of the  costs estimated for rape is dangerously  flawed . As with abusive sexual 
contact, these incidents  should, at a minimum,  trigger investigation/adjudica tion and sanctioning 
costs. Moreover, the earning loss while perpetrator s are confined – which the Department 
excluded from its matrix – is unquestionably relevant here, as all corrections staff are employed 
and should be terminated upon a finding that the y have engaged in sexual activity with an 
inmate.  
 
Question s 49-50:  
 Are there any additional nonmonetary benefits of implementing the PREA standards 
not mentioned in the IRIA?  
                                                 
123 In its recent survey of prison and jail inmates, the BJS determined that history of victimization was the most 
statistically significant trait of inmates who were sexually victimized at their current facility. See ADULT SURVEY ,

 115 
 Are any of the nonmonetary benefits set forth in the IRIA actually capable of 
quantification? If so, are there available methodologies for quantifying such benefits 
or sources  of data from which such quantification can be drawn?  
 
The Department generally does a good job of laying out most of the key benefits of avoiding 
prison er rape with respect to victims, other inmates, families, prison administrators and staff, and 
society at large. However, the Department fails to address the moral benefit to society of ending 
a form of torture that remains widespread in this country and the rela ted improved standing that 
these efforts will confer on the U.S. in the international human rights community.125  
 
The Department also omits the benefits that would stem from the improved transparency, 
monitoring, and community collaboration called for by th e standards. In addition to the agency 
benefit of outside expertise and perspectives – including access to best practices for addressing 
sexual abuse – increased transparency and accountability of corrections facilities is generally 
beneficial to a democra tic society by providing greater access to information about these public 
institutions. In the long run, such transparency and accountability will make corrections facilities 
better -run and safer institutions.  
 
Many of the benefits identified by the Depart ment as non -monetary can be quantified. For 
example, the financial benefits to families and society of preventing former inmates from being 
unable to work d ue to the emotional trauma of sexual abuse can at least partially be measured by 
the cost of public assistance and other forms of governmental support that victims will need upon 
reentry . Similarly, the lost earning potential and income tax revenue could be estimated . The cost 
                                                 
125 Sexual violence in U.S. detention facilities has been recognized internationally as a form of torture and ill -
treatment, and U.N. bodies monitoring U.S. compliance with its interna tional human rights obligations have 
repeatedly expressed concern about the nation‘s performance on this point. The U.N. Committee Against Torture 
recommended that the U.S. design and implement appropriate measures to prevent sexual violence in detention, and 
ensure that all allegations of prisoner rape be investigated promptly and independently. Committee Against Torture,

 116 of increased incarceration for perpetrators of sexual abuse in detention can b e quantified based 
on the rates for housing a prisoner.126 
 
Finally, the Department makes no effort to quantify the benefits of avoiding investigations, 
grievances or litigation. Each of these processes requires  the dedication of substantial resources 
that c an be measured , including the  cost of staff and attorney time,  the development of 
documentation, and the likely fees and judgments imposed.  Recently, for example, a class action 
lawsuit brought by female prisoners who had been sexually abused by correction s staff in 
Michigan settled for $100 million, after several trials and more than ten years of active 
litigation.127  
 
Question 51 : Are there available sources of data relating to the compliance costs 
associated with the proposed standards, other than the sou rces cited and relied upon in 
the IRIA? If so, please provide them.  
 
As the Department‘s proposed standards were not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, there are no data available about the overall compliance cost s 
associated with these provisions, beyond the data compiled by the Department. While some 
agencies have estimated compliance costs for the Commission‘s recommended standards (with 
many of these estimates reflected in the surveys conducted by Booz Allen Ha milton), these 
anecdotal projections vary widely and are not reliable. Corrections officials charged with 
establishing and ultimately defending corrections cost estimates to their appropriators had every 
incentive to inflate costs and little motivation to think creatively and strategically about how to 
devise low -cost ways to comply with standards that are not yet in force.  
 
The compliance cost data relied upon by the Department are in fact replete with problems. In 
addition to depending on estimates provid ed by corrections officials who had reason to inflate 
their projected costs, the Booz Allen Hamilton statistical analysis relies on the following 
inaccurate assumptions: (1) that its sample of correctional facilities was random, (2) that the

 117 sample came from a normal (bell curve) distribution, and (3) that the cost -per-inmate approach 
meant  that the sample accurately represent ed the average costs per inmate for all facilit ies 
nationally . In fact, the 49 sites included in Booz Allen Hamilton‘s report were no t randomly 
selected : many participating agencies volunteered, which makes it very unlikely that they 
accurately represent the range of PREA readiness. In fact, given that everyone participating 
knew that this information was being gathered to determine whe ther the Commission‘s 
recommended standards were too costly, facilities that were  less compliant or otherwise resistant 
to the standards had the strongest incentive s to participate, as they could skew the results to 
indicate higher costs than would otherwi se be needed. Given the small sample size, there is also 
a risk of over -fitting the data by using them as primary cost-estimate s rather than as a robustness 
check on other estimates.  
 
In addition to the Booz Allen Hamilton data, the Department relied upon internal assessments 
provided by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). The 
Department has not disclosed these data publicly. However, even without seeing these 
assessments, it if fair to assume that reliance on them is problemat ic because the participating 
agencies have shown a consistent lack of leadership on the issue of preventing and addressing 
sexual abuse in detention. As discussed in Section I of this submission, BOP and USMS leaders 
have generally not embraced PREA, and f ederal inmates remain highly vulnerable to abuse.128 
Thus, relying on these systems sets a dangerously low bar that, in several cases, provides weaker 
protections than those already provided by other corrections agencies.  
 
If the Department wants to establis h a valid assessment of compliance costs, it should not rely on 
the speculative estimates of corrections administrators. Rather, it should have taken a structural 
approach that would have include d developing reasonable assumptions about how different 
facilities would comply with the regulations and estimating the total costs of compliance over the 
entire country, using the statistical estimates as a robustness check.  This would have provide d 
more clarity about the cost of compliance and the assumptions made  in developing these 
estimates.  
                                                 
128 While Sect ion I, supra, focuses on the BOP, the Inspector General‘s report also discusses the deficiencies in the 
USMS‘s efforts to address staff sexual abuse and misconduct. See OIG 2009 REPORT , supra note 1 2.    Just Detention International

Question s 52-55:  
 Are there available data as to the number of lockups that will be affected by the 
proposed standards, the number of individuals who are detained in lockups on an 
annual basis, and/or the anticipated compli ance costs for lockups? If so, please 
provide them.  
 Are there available data as to the number of community confinement facilities that 
will be affected by the proposed standards, the number of individuals who reside or 
are detained in such facilities on an  annual basis, or the anticipated compliance costs 
for community confinement facilities? If so, please provide them.  
 Has the Department appropriately differentiated the estimated compliance costs with 
regard to the different types of confinement facilities  (prisons, jails, juvenile facilities, 
community confinement facilities, and lockups)? If not, why and to what extent should 
compliance costs be expected to be higher or lower for one type or another?  
 Are there additional methodologies for conducting an as sessment of the costs of 
compliance with the proposed standards? If so, please propose them.  
 
As discussed above (in Questions 38 -41), JDI knows of no relevant data regarding the number of 
lockups and community confinement facilities or the number of inmat es or victims within these 
facilities. The BJS should compile data regarding the number of facilities and the number of 
people who pass through them on an annual basis, and victimization rates should be established 
through inmate surveys (in community conf inement facilities) and targeted questions in the 
National Crime Victimization Survey.  
 
Given its acknowledged lack of data regarding the number of lockups and community 
confinement  facilities , it is unclear how the Department came up with its  total costs for these 
types of facilities. Facility by facility, however, these costs should be lower than the Department 
has estimated,  as lockups and community confinement facilities are often connected to jails and 
prisons that need to comply with the standards. Th e projected benefits associated with these 
facilities, however,  should be as high as in a corrections facility or the community, as victims 
will experience the same level of suffering and debilitation that was factored in to those analyses.  
 
Even with the  serious  limitations of the Department‘s data  in mind , however, it is clear that the 
PREA standards will pay for themselves quickly in all types of facilities. The Department 
consistently relied on overly conservative data  in terms of benefits and generous e stimates in 
terms of costs , and still found that a mere three percent reduction in abuse is needed for the   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 119 standards to break even in their costs and monetary benefits . As modest as the Department‘s 
proposals are, their impact will still easily surpass thi s low hurdle.  
 
Questions 56 -61:  
 With respect to §§ 115.12, 115.112, 115.212, and 115.312, are there other methods of 
estimating the extent to which contract renewals and renegotiations over the 15 -year 
period will lead to costs for agencies that adopt the  proposed standards?  
  Do agencies expect to incur costs associated with proposed §§ 115.13, 115.113, 
115.213, and 115.313, notwithstanding the fact that it does not mandate any 
particular level of staffing or the use of video monitoring? Why or why not? If  so, 
what are the potential cost implications of this standard under various alternative 
scenarios concerning staffing mandates or video monitoring mandates? What 
decisions do agencies anticipate making in light of the assessments called for by this 
standa rd, and what will it cost to implement those decisions?  
 With respect to §§ 115.14, 115.114, 115.214, and 115.314, will the limitations on 
cross -gender viewing (and any associated retrofitting and construction of privacy 
panels) impose any costs on agencies ? If so, please provide any data from which a 
cost estimate can be developed for such measures.  
 Will the requirement in §§ 115.31, 115.231, and 115.331 that agencies train staff on 
how to communicate effectively and professionally with lesbian, gay, bisexu al, 
transgender, or intersex residents lead to additional costs for correctional facilities, 
over and above the costs of other training requirements in the standards? If so, 
please provide any data from which a cost estimate can be developed for such 
train ing. 
 Has the Department accounted for all of the costs associated with §§ 115.52, 
115.252, and 115.352, dealing with exhaustion of administrative remedies? If not, 
what additional costs might be incurred, and what data exist from which an estimate 
of those  costs can be developed?  
 Is there any basis at this juncture to estimate the compliance costs associated with §§ 
115.93, 115.193, 115.293, and 115.393, pertaining to audits? How much do agencies 
anticipate compliance with this standard is likely to cost on  a per -facility basis, under 
various assumptions as to the type and frequency or breadth of audits?  
 
In facilities that currently are not taking the measures necessary to protect inmates from abuse, 
meeting this basic expectation will undoubtedly require s ome expense. However, the 
Department‘s own analysis also confirms the enormous financial benefit of protecting inmates 
from abuse – and in any case, providing such basic protections to inmates is a constitutional and 
moral obligation, to which there may al so be financial considerations.129 By parsing out the 
individual costs of each standard, the Department loses this critical perspective.  
                                                 
129 In this context, it is worth noting that t he Supreme  Court has unequivocally held that cost cannot be a factor in 
refusing to meet Constitutional obligations , such as preserving inmates‘ right to be free from sexual abuse . See, e.g.,   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 120  
Nonetheless, as discussed further in the analysis of each of the provisions identified in these 
questions, the possible  costs of these measures must be considered in relation to the benefits they 
will generate. Regarding § 1 15.12 /112/212/312, in light of the conclusions of the Department‘s 
break -even analysis – which clearly show that the benefits of the standards will far  outweigh 
their costs even though the Department used overly conservative assumptions to reach its 
conclusions – private prison corporations cannot justify imposing additional costs to implement 
these measures. Agencies must demand that all inmates from th eir jurisdiction are protected from 
abuse, whether they are in public or private facilities. Having the force of binding regulation 
from the federal government behind these demands should ease any negotiations on this point . 
Compliance with the standards c annot be used as a bargaining chip.  
 
With respect to the staffing and technology requirements of § 115.13/113/213/313 , it is hard to 
imagine how the Department‘s current provision would incur any costs as it lacks any specific 
requirements or guidance on what adequate staffing and technology would entail. If JDI‘s 
recommendations are adopted, agencies would still not be held to any specific levels of staffing 
or camera use. By suggesting a number of concrete and relevant factors in sexual abuse that must 
be taken into account when making staffing and technology decisions, agencies should be able to 
allocate staff time and cameras efficiently, without incurring undue expense.  
 
Contrary to the claims of some officials, limiting cross -gender supervision to pr event the viewing 
or touching of inmates of the opposite gender need not require massive re -staffing. Basic 
measures such as installing privacy screens, designating roving officers, limiting pat searches to 
places where there is a likelihood of contraband being obtained (and conducting thorough 
searches at these locations), and requiring officers to announce themselves just prior to entering

 121 cell areas when inmates are likely to be changing or otherwise in states of undress would not 
result in significant c osts. Doing so, however, would reduce the opportunities for staff sexual 
abuse and would help de -sexualize corrections culture – with all the financial benefits that would 
be associated with such improvements.  
 
In its cost analysis of the Department‘s pro posed standards, the researchers from Booz Allen 
Hamilton concluded that the training requirements collectively would not have any cost 
impact.130 There is no reason for training on communicating with LGBTI inmates  (§ 
115.31/231/ 331) to be treated differentl y than any of the other training topics. Notably, even the 
marginal costs that could be incurred from the development of curricula and materials will be 
negated by federal efforts already under way to develop training materials on this topic.131 
Moreover, gi ven the consistent  findings  that LGBTI inmates are disproportionately targeted for 
sexual abuse, this training is clearly needed and will ultimately save money by reducing 
incidents of sexual abuse while increasing reporting of such abuse . The exhaustion p rovision,  
§ 115.52 /252/352, does not go far enough to allow for any meaningful cost savings or expenses. 
The Department revised the standard essentially to maintain the status quo within the BOP, 
whose grievance policy is more stringent than that of 18 st ates. Easing these procedural 
requirements for sexual abuse cases, and ensuring that all reports of sexual violence are afforded 
the highest level of review in the first instance, would minimize costs incurred by administrative 
and judicial review of wheth er a survivor complied with arbitrary requirements. It would also 
result in the tremendous benefits of encouraging the merits of these claims to be addressed 
swiftly and efficiently.  
 
Finally, b ecause most facilities currently are not subject to any  relev ant external oversight, audits 
will invariably require some  expense . However, given the lack of specificity in  
§ 115.93/193/293/393 about  what a PREA audit would entail, the actual costs are impossible to 
determine. Booz Allen Hamilton estimated that  the cost of triennial audits of every detention

 122 facility would total $77.5 million per year – 14 percent of the compliance cost for the remaining 
standards.132 This estimate includes a significant ―level of effort‖  on the part  of corrections staff, 
assuming that  a full -time employee would be needed to support four prison audits per year. This 
estimate is excessive, resulting in staffing costs for the audits exceeding the actual auditor costs. 
Staff will need to collect most of the necessary data pursuant to other  provisions, and the 
remaining preparation and response required should not entail more than a week or two of effort . 
Moreover, quality audits will substantially improve safety and decrease costs within facilities, by 
identifying problems before they escal ate and suggesting  realistic, cost -effective solutions.  
 
Questions 62 -63:  
 Has the Department used the correct assumptions (in particular the assumption of 
constant cost) in projecting ongoing costs in the out years? Should it adjust its 
projections for th e possibility that the cost of compliance may decrease over time as 
correctional agencies adopt new innovations that will make their compliance more 
efficient? If such an adjustment is appropriate, please propose a methodology for 
doing so and a source of data from which valid predictions as to ―learning‖ can be 
derived.  
 Are there any data showing how the marginal cost of rape reduction is likely to 
change once various benchmarks of reduction have been achieved? If not, is it 
appropriate for the Department to assume, for purposes of its breakeven analysis, 
that the costs and benefits of reducing prison rape are linear, at least within the 
range relevant to the analysis? Why or why not?  
 
Over time – as the standards become law of the land, best practices beco me normalized, the 
corrections culture becomes safer, incidents of abuse are reduced , and collateral safety concerns 
are addressed – the costs of implementing the standards should go down , while the benefits 
should go up. Additionally, several of the stand ards for which major or moderate ongoing costs 
have been estimated are also subject to Constitutional requirements. Screening, supervision, 
training, and provision of ongoing medical and mental health care are obligations independent of 
PREA and their cost s should therefore not be associated only with the PREA standards.  
 
Question 64 : Are the expectations as to the effectiveness of the proposed standards that 
are subsumed within the breakeven analysis ( e.g., 0.7% -1.7% reduction in baseline 
prevalence needed  to justify startup costs and 2.06% -3.13% reduction required for 
ongoing costs) reasonable? Why or why not? Are there available data from which 
reasonable predictions can be made as to the extent to which these proposed standards

   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 123 will be effective in reduc ing the prevalence of rape and sexual abuse in prisons? If so, 
please supply them.  
 
The assumptions and valuations the Department has made in estimating the benefits of 
preventing sexual abuse in detention are extremely conservative. By erring on the side of great 
caution in its projections of those benefits, and then showing that they would still outweigh costs 
even if the standards saved only three percent of all victims, the Department‘s analysis makes 
clear that, even with additional costs, the net resu lt of the standards will be substantial savings. 
The goal of these provisions , as is made clear in the title and language of the Prison Rape 
Elimination Act,  is not to reduce prison rape  marginally , but to eliminate sexual abuse in 
detention . If the standa rds are strengthened in accordance with JDI‘s recommendations  and then 
fully implemented , the shockingly high rates of abuse w ould decrease by far more than three 
percent.  
 
The additional costs incurred by JDI‘s recommendations will be modest, and will be  dramatically  
outweighed by the resulting benefits. Fewer incidents of abuse will reduce the costs of the 
investigations, grievances, and medical and mental health care required after an assault. Facilities 
that are run more safely will have fewer security  breaches, less physical violence, greater staff 
retention, and ultimately, less litigation. Most importantly, by reducing the extent to which 
inmates and residents endure the trauma of sexual abuse in detention, these basic measures will 
decrease recidivi sm and increase the likelihood that detainees become law -abiding and 
contributing member s of society.  
 
Since the standards are an effort to codify innovations and best practices of facilities that have 
already had some success in reducing their rates of se xual abuse, examining the BJS data may 
allow for a conservative, but not arbitrary, basis for estimating the impact of the standards. 
Specifically, the estimate of possible gains can be based on what has already been accomplished 
across the country by taki ng the average rate of abuse in the best half of the surveyed facilities,   Just Detention International  
   Comments to the Department of Justice   
  Docket No. OAG –131 
 
 124 and assuming that this rate could become the national average. The top half of all facilities have 
made their achievements without enforced standards, so there is still plenty of roo m for them to 
improve and every reason to expect that they will once the standards are in place, though 
probably not as dramatically as the bottom half of facilities. If the Department issues strong 
standards  and enforces their compliance , it would not be unrealistic to expect that the national 
rate of abuse could be lowered to that of the top quarter or even the top tenth of all facilities.  
 
According the latest BJS data, in  adult prisons and jails, 4.4 percent of prisoners and 3.1 percent 
of jail inmates are sexually abused nationwide over the course of a year. But i n the better half of 
all facilities, only 2.069 percent of prisoners are abused, and only 1.436 percent of jail inmates 
are sexually abused. 133 Thus, if the standards allowed all facilities to d o only as well as the top 
half do now, they would be sparing not 3 percent of the people sexually abused in detention, but 
more than 53  percent. This means that had the standards been in place in 2008, instead of the 
199,500 people who the Department says were abused in adult prisons and jails, there would 
have been about 93,100. More than 100,000 adults (as well as many thousands of children) 
would have been saved an experience from which few recover emotionally.

 125 D. CONCLUSION  
The national standards man dated by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) have the potential 
to become the most important tool so far in the effort to end sexual abuse in U.S. detention. 
Strong standards will help spare countless men, women, and children every year an experience 
from which few recover emotionally. Indeed, JDI believes that forceful PREA standards should 
be able to prevent more than half the sexual abuse that plagues American detention facilities 
today. The development of these standards represents a once -in-a-lifeti me opportunity for the 
Attorney General to end a domestic human rights crisis.  
 
As made clear in this submission, Just Detention International considers several of the 
Department‘s proposed standards too weak to offer the protections inmates need, and to which 
they have a legal and moral right. The Justice Department's own data, together with its 
preliminary cost -benefit analysis of the standards, make abundantly clear that much stronger 
standards would be warranted even from a purely financial perspective . Weaker standards would 
be arbitrary and capricious in their failure to protect inmates, detainees and residents, particularly 
in light of the Department‘s own data and cost analysis.  
 
When the government removes someone‘s freedom, it takes on an absolute  responsibility to 
protect that person‘s safety. No matter what crime someone might have committed, rape must 
not be part of the penalty.    Just Detention International

List of Provisions in the Department of Justice’s  
Proposed National Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Prison Ra pe  
that are Missing from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s  
Proposed 2010 Performance -Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) Provision 2.11e 
 
1. PBNDS 2.11 does not detail how a detainee can report abuse. As a result, it is unclear 
whether there are multiple reporting options (§ 115.51) or if any of them accommodate 
inmates with special needs (§ 115.15). PBNDS 2.11 also does not provide for third party 
reporting (§ 115.54).  
 
2. PBNDS 2.11 does not provide for agreements with outside public entities and c ommunity 
service providers (§ 115.22), nor do detainees have access to confidential support 
services (§ 115.53).  
 
3. PBNDS 2.11 does not provide for confidential staff reporting (§ 115.51(d)), nor does it 
detail staff responsibilities in the aftermath of a re port, other than to say staff should 
follow facility policies (§§ 115.61 -115.63).  
 
4. Aside from stating that retaliation will not be tolerated, PBNDS 2.11 does not detail any 
efforts that must be made to ensure that retaliation does not occur. (§ 115.65)  
 
5. PBNDS 2.11 does not detail who conducts criminal investigations and, if facility officers 
are not empowered to do so, what the policy is for contacting the appropriate legal 
authority and ensuring that criminal and administrative investigations are coordinat ed. (§  
115.23  and § 115.71). The PBNDS also does not provide for detainees to be informed of 
key actions in an investigation/prosecution (§ 115.73).  
 
6. There is no specialized training for investigative and medical/mental health staff in the 
PBNDS 2.11 (§ 11 5.34 and § 115.35).  
 
7. The screening portion of PBNDS 2.11 does not include the risk factors delineated in § 
115.41.  
 
8. PBNDS 2.11 does not discuss how screening information would be used (§ 115.42), 
particularly (a) whether a detainee‘s own assessment of vul nerability will be given 
serious consideration and (b) whether there will be a case -by-case assessment for 
transgender or intersex detainees to consider whether placement in a facility for male or 
female detainees would best ensure the health and safety of  the detainee without 
imposing undue management or security problems.

 132 9. PBNDS 2.11 does not provide for incident reviews (§ 115.86) or outside audits (§ 
115.93).  
 
10. PBNDS 2.11 does not cover background checks for staff in hiring and promotion 
decisions (§ 115 .16). 
 
11. PBNDS 2.11 does not provide for unannounced rounds conducted by intermediate or 
higher supervisors in facilities with more than 500 inmates (§ 115.13(d)).  
 
12. While the PBNDS states that there should be a sexual assault coordinator at each facility, 
it does not provide for an upper -level agency -wide PREA coordinator (§ 115.11(b)).  
 
13. The use of protective custody as a means of protecting detainees (§§ 115.43, 115.66) is 
not sufficiently addressed in PBNDS 2.11.    Just Detention International

Just Detention International’s Calculation of the  
Prevalence Rate of Sexual Abuse in the Top Half of Facilities in the BJS Adult Inmate 
Survey  
 
The BJS administered its adult inmate survey at 167 prisons and 286 jails. To calculate 
the prevalence rate of the top half of facilities, JDI took the rates of abuse from the better 
performing 84 prisons and 143 jails in the BJS study and averaged them. (The figures reached 
this way are not weighted averages: JDI did not try to account for the sizes of each different 
facility or the number of i nmates who responded to the survey in each . With such large sample 
sizes, doing so would have made little difference.)  
 
For both prisons and jails, JDI divided the average rate of abuse for the top half of facilities by 
the overall rate found by the BJS; then multiplied the numbers this produced by the 
Department‘s estimate of the numbers of victims in prisons and jails to reach the absolute 
numbers .  
 
JDI did not attempt to perform the same calculation for juvenile facilities out of concern that the 
more limited data there might not support such an exercise; however, JDI is confident that strong 
standards could make a dramatic difference in juvenile facilities, perhaps an even greater 
difference than in adult prisons and jails given the higher overall rates of abuse  in juvenile 
facilities . 
 
Jails (rate of abuse multiplied by the  number of facilities with that rate):  
 
2.8 x 4 = 11.2  
2.7 x 7 = 18.9  
2.6 x 8 = 20.8  
2.5 x 5 = 12.5  
2.4 x 5 = 12.0  
2.3 x 6 = 13.8  
2.2 x 4 = 8.8

1.5 x 3 = 4.5  
1.4 x 7 = 9.8  
1.3 x 2 = 2.6  
1.2 x 3 = 3.6

.4 x 2 = .8  
0 x 28 = 0.0  
 
The products in that list all add up to  205.4 . The average rate of abuse in these facilities, 
calculated by dividing the sum of the averages by the number of facilities (205.4/143), is 1.436 . 
Dividing this rate of abuse by the rate of abuse in all jails ( 1.436/3.1 ) gives 0 .46326  – meaning 
that the ra te of abuse in the better performing half of all jails was only 46.326 percent of the 
national rate.  
 
In this scenario, 53.674  percent  of victims would be saved by the standards  ((1 - 0.46326 ) x 100) . 
The number of victims in adult jails would be 50,078 ( 0.46326 x 108,100 ).

The sum of the products is 173.8 . Dividing this sum by the number of prisons ( 173.8/84 ) gives 
an average rate of abuse for these facilities of 2.069 . Dividing this rate of abuse by the rate of 
abuse in all prisons ( 2.069/4.4 ) we get  0.47023. Multiplying this by the number of prisoners 
whom the BJS estimates were sexually assaulted in 2008 (0 .47023 x 91,400 ) gives, as the 
estimated number of victims of sexual abuse in prison in 2008 if the national rate of abuse had 
been as low as that of  the better performing half of all prisons in the BJS study, 42,979. 
 
Adding together the number of victims there would have been in jails and prisons if the national 
average had been the average rate of abuse of the better performing half of all facilitie s (50,078 + 
42,979 ) would result in a total number of 93,057  victims . Round ing to the nearest hundred, as the 
Department does, this would be  93,100  victims .  
 
Dividing this number of victims by the number of victims estimated in the Department‘s IRIA 
(93,100/199,500)  results in a differential of  0.466666667 .  
 
Based on these calculations, 53 1/3 percent of adult victims would have been saved  (1-
0.466666667  x 100).
