Sexual Violence in Philippine Detention Facilities 
 
An Alternative NGO Report Prepared for the 42nd 
Session of the U.N. Committee Against Torture  
 
April 2009  2 “CASES OF RAPE, sexual abuse and torture committed against women detainees 
by the police, military and prison officials/person nel in the [Philippines] have 
been brought to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights.”— 
Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines 1 
 
 
I. Introduction 
 
Just Detention International (JDI) is pleased to su bmit this report to the U.N. Committee 
Against Torture (Committee). JDI is an internationa l human rights organization based in 
the United States that seeks to end sexual violence  in all forms of detention. 2  
 
The sexual abuse of detainees is an often overlooke d aspect of the torture and ill-
treatment that occurs in Philippine detention cente rs. The Commission on Human Rights 
of the Philippines (CHR),3 the Department of the Interior and Local Governmen t 
(DILG), 4 and human rights advocates 5 have all highlighted cases of sexual abuse in 
Philippine detention facilities. Based on these rep orts and on anecdotal evidence, 
observers agree that prisoner rape is widespread in  the Philippines and constitutes an 
urgent human rights concern.  
 
Rape in detention, whether committed by corrections  staff or by detainees, is recognized 
internationally as torture. 6 Other forms of sexual assault and harassment in de tention may 
constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, i n which case they also amount to 
violations of the Convention Against Torture and Ot her Cruel Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT),7 as well as other provisions of international human  
rights law. Cases of sexual abuse in detention tend  not to be isolated incidents, but the 
result of a systemic failure to protect the safety of detainees. Victims of prisoner rape are 
left beaten and bloodied, contract HIV and other se xually transmitted diseases, and suffer 
severe psychological harm. Once released – and the vast majority of prisoners do 
eventually get out – they return to their communiti es with all of their physical and 
emotional scars. 8 
 
The Committee has identified a number of issues to be considered as part of the 
examination of the Philippines’ second periodic rep ort that are directly linked to the 
government’s failings in meeting its legal obligati ons to prevent and address sexual abuse 
behind bars. 9 These include: the lack of implementation of basic  legal safeguards for 
detainees (para. 2); reports of torture and ill-tre atment by police and military officials 
during investigative detention (para. 3); reports o f severe overcrowding (para. 19); the 
failure to separate female inmates and juveniles fr om adult male inmates (paras. 20, 21); 
and ensuring the independent investigation and pros ecution of reports of torture and 
cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainee s by law enforcement and military 
officials (paras. 22-24, 30). 10  
 
 
 
  3 II. Overview of Sexual Violence in Philippine Deten tion Facilities 
 
Sexual violence in detention, like other human righ ts abuses, flourishes where it is 
surrounded by silence and secrecy. Few Filipino inm ates are willing to come forward and 
report sexual abuse, but this lack of formal compla ints is in no way an indication that 
facilities are safe. On the contrary, Philippine de tention facilities exhibit many of the 
conditions that are most likely to lead to sexual a buse, including severe overcrowding, 
lack of adequate supervision, failure to separate t he most vulnerable inmates from likely 
predators, homophobia, and a culture of silence aro und sexual abuse that results in 
impunity for corrupt officials. 11  Current and former inmates, corrections officials,  prison 
ombudspersons, and human rights advocates agree tha t it is fear, shame, and a belief 
among inmates that no help is available that preven ts survivors of sexual abuse from 
speaking out about their experiences. 12    
 
In one of the few official studies conducted on pri soner rape in the Philippines, four 
percent of 552 female jail inmates surveyed reporte d to the DILG that they had 
experienced sexual abuse while detained. 13  Seven of the women had been raped, while 
others were subjected to abusive conduct including sexual touching, kissing, corrections 
officials exposing their genitalia, and attempted r ape. 14  A more recent study found that 
ten percent of the women detainees surveyed had had  sex with jail officials prior to their 
transfer to the Correctional Institution for Women (CIW), illuminating the widespread 
abuse of women inmates by corrections staff.15   
 
In 2001, in response to these and other reports of sexual abuse of women in detention by 
police, military, and prison officials, the CHR rel eased the human rights advisory On the 
Sexual Abuse and Torture of Women in Custody , which noted that women who are 
prostitutes and those who have committed minor crim es or are alleged to have violated 
the Philippines’ anti-vagrancy law are among those most likely to be subjected to sexual 
violence in custody.16  Such abuses have continued unabated, despite gover nment efforts 
to address sexual violence against detainees, inclu ding a 2001 pronouncement by the 
Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) that it had adopted a zero-tolerance 
policy toward staff sexual misconduct, and plans fo r the formation of a government task 
force on sexual violence against women in detention .17  
 
Juveniles are also frequently the targets of sexual  abuse in detention. Such abuse is often 
linked to the widespread failure to separate childr en from adults in detention facilities 
throughout the country, in violation of domestic an d international legal protections. 18  
Despite the passage of the Comprehensive Juvenile J ustice System and Welfare Act of 
2006, 19  which requires that children in police custody be held separately from adult 
detainees and from detainees of the opposite sex, c hildren in custody continue to be 
placed deliberately in harm’s way.20  Moreover, it is not clear what steps, if any, have  
been taken to implement a key provision in the law that prohibits law enforcement 
officials from sexually harassing or making sexual advances toward juveniles in their 
custody.  21  
  4 Documentation of sexual violence in Philippine dete ntion facilities has focused 
predominantly on women detainees, juveniles, and po litical prisoners. However, there is 
growing evidence that sexual abuse is rampant throu ghout the country’s criminal justice 
system, affecting men, women, and youth.22  In many provincial jails, officials continue to 
house women with male inmates,23  and male corrections officers continue to guard 
female inmates in violation of agency regulations.24  Gangs hold tremendous sway in male 
detention facilities and corrections officials ofte n cede power to so-called “mayores” 
(gang leaders), due to corruption or in an effort t o preserve institutional order. 25  
Detainees most vulnerable to abuse and extortion re gularly seek protection from the 
gangs, often providing money or sex in return. 26   
 
The Anti-Rape Law of 1997, 27  the Rape Victim and Assistance Act of 1998, 28  and the 
Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 29  are among the laws already in place that help 
to address sexual violence in detention. Notably, i n 2008 lawmakers introduced to 
Congress the Prison Rape Elimination Act, 30  legislation modeled after a United States 
law passed in 2003. 31  The law calls for the establishment of a zero-tole rance standard for 
sexual abuse in detention through the collection of  national data on the incidence of 
prisoner rape along with an examination of the best  and worst performing detention 
facilities, as well as the provision of grants and technical assistance to support efforts to 
address the problem. A second key piece of legislat ion calls for the separation of women 
detainees from males behind bars.32  In addition to this legislation, recently introduc ed to 
Congress are bills criminalizing torture,33  improving professional standards and training 
for corrections officers, 34  and calling for the alleviation of overcrowding. 35   
 
III. Recommendations 
 
While the various enacted and proposed laws discuss ed above have the potential to bring 
about tremendous progress in the handling of sexual  violence in detention, there are 
additional steps the government must take in order to fulfill its obligations under the 
CAT. Therefore, Just Detention International calls upon the Government of the 
Philippines to do the following:  
 
Prevent Sexual Violence in Detention: 
 
• Review current policies and procedures for the cust ody and treatment of detainees 
with an eye toward preventing sexual violence, in a ccordance with Article 11 of 
the CAT. 36  
 
• Train all corrections personnel in the prohibition against torture – including the 
absolute responsibility under international law to protect detainees from sexual 
abuse – in accordance with Article 10 of the CAT.37   
 
• Ensure separation of juvenile detainees from adults , and of female detainees from 
males. 
  5 • Implement an effective classification system that i dentifies detainees vulnerable 
to sexual abuse and separates them from likely pred ators. 
 
• Provide adequate housing for all detainees and take  steps to address 
overcrowding. 
 
• Enforce regulations calling for female inmates to b e guarded by officers of the 
same gender. 
 
Implement a Legal Framework for Addressing Prisoner  Rape and Improving Independent 
Monitoring of Detention Facilities: 
 
• Take legislative, administrative, and judicial meas ures to prevent torture and 
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, in accordan ce with Articles 2 and 16 of 
the CAT. 38  
 
• Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Agai nst Torture (OPCAT). 39  
 
• Enact the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2008, as w ell as legislation 
criminalizing torture. 
 
• Repeal the anti-vagrancy statute, a vaguely worded law that has often been used 
as a pretext for arbitrary arrest and detention of women who are then subjected to 
sexual abuse at the hands of law enforcement. 40    
 
• Amend Penal Code §4, Article 245, “Abuses against c hastity,” to criminalize all 
sexual contact between corrections staff and detain ees, regardless of gender. 41   
 
• Enforce the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 200 6, to ensure, in particular, 
compliance with provisions aimed at protecting chil dren in custody from sexual 
harassment and abuse. 
 
• Permit Article 22 communications with the Committee , allowing individuals who 
are victims of sexual abuse in detention to address  communications to the 
Committee once they have exhausted available avenue s of relief within the 
Philippine legal system. 
 
 
Ensure An Effective Response to Instances of Prison er Rape: 
 
• Ensure that detainees who are sexually victimized a re able to report the abuse 
without being subjected to punitive measures by sta ff. 
 
• Protect detainees who report sexual abuse from reta liation by the perpetrator(s). 
  6 • Promptly and impartially investigate and prosecute all instances of sexual abuse 
in custody in accordance with Articles 12, 13 and 1 4 of the CAT. 42   
 
• Provide access to confidential medical and mental h ealth care for survivors of 
sexual abuse in detention.
