Large disparities in economic and political power make indigenous peoples especially vulnerable to wrong-doing. For more than 30 years, we have worked to build a legal framework to help indigenous peoples win recognition of their human rights, including: right to exist as distinct peoples and cultures; right to be free from discrimination and forced assimilation; and right of self-determination and other essential rights.We invite you to review the Center’s Human Rights work and get involved:Safe Women Strong NationsThe United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous PeoplesThe American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous PeoplsHuman Rights TrainingCenter urges implementation of the American Declaration at first annual OAS Inter-American Forum on Indigenous PeoplesRead more about Center urges implementation of the American Declaration at first annual OAS Inter-American Forum on Indigenous PeoplesStanding Rock Sioux Tribe Takes #NODAPL to the United NationsRepresentatives from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, today to garner international opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the reservation.Read more about Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Takes #NODAPL to the United NationsIn Peru, Indigenous are Fighting Drug TraffickersDuring the pandemic, some Latin American countries were so focused on dealing with Covid that they got distracted from other menaces like drug dealing.
