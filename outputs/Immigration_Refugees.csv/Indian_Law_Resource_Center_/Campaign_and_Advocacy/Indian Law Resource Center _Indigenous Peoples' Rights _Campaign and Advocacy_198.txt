This is the most important advance in the law of self-determination in more than a generation, and it remains uncertain how this right will be in fact put into effect in the Americas and elsewhere.At present, we are working on just one case in the United States, but we are devoting particular attention to securing the right of self-determination in the context of the Organization of American States draft American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  It is important to win United States and Canadian support for the right of self-determination in the American Declaration, because both countries initially voted against the UN Declaration.  We are also beginning to work on the implementation of the right of self-determination included in the UN Declaration.  This will include seeking UN measures and mechanisms to assure that countries actually respect this right and assure its exercise.  We will surely continue this implementation work in the UN and the OAS for many years to come.  We are also giving special attention to the right of self-determination in our law reform work, as discussed below.  We expect that in the United States the right of self-determination may well come under much greater attack by the courts and even by Congress in the next ten years.Fifth Circuit Strongly Upholds the Indian Child Welfare ActOn August 9th, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act -- a great victory for tribes and those who fought to protect ICWARead more about Fifth Circuit Strongly Upholds the Indian Child Welfare ActStanding Rock Sioux Tribe Takes #NODAPL to the United NationsRepresentatives from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, today to garner international opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the reservation.Read more about Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Takes #NODAPL to the United NationsSCOTUS upholds tribal hunting rights in Herrera v.

WyomingDefending Mancari is Our Most Urgent TaskThe recent Texas Federal District Court ruling in Brackeen v. Zinke, which struck down portions of the Indian Child Welfare Act and declared ICWA a race based statute, is the latest development in a long campaign by anti-Indian groups and the federal government to get rid of one of the most important principles in federal Indian law:that laws benefiting Indian tribes are based upon their classification as political or governmental units – and are not racial classifications.This is a principle embedded in U.S. law from the very beginning and explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in Morton v. Mancari.Forty-five years ago, the Supreme Court recognized in Morton v. Mancari that without this principle, almost the entire body of federal legislation relating to Indian and Alaska Native tribes could be found unconstitutional as racially discriminatory.Supporting and defending the Mancari decision and the rule that it stands for is perhaps the most urgent and important Indian law issue of our time. The stakes for tribes are very high, because the ability of the federal government to carry out its trust responsibilities to tribes, to protect Indian tribes and their resources, and to provide programs and financial assistance to tribes, could be greatly diminished if these challenges succeed.Read more about Defending Mancari is Our Most Urgent TaskTribes are governments, not racial classificationsTribes are governmental and political entities, not racial groups. This is a principle embedded in U.S. law from the very beginning and explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in Morton v. Mancari in 1977.
