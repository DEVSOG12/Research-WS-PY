"The IFC is reviewing its policies and we want to see accountability and consistency in the revised documents. Our submission reflects important developments in human rights law over the past four years, including the adoption and implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by many countries around the world. We ask that the IFC take into account our comments and recommendations so that its policies and practices protect the rights of indigenous peoples.”The Indian Law Resource Center invites you to read our Comments and Recommendations submitted to the IFC.SiteWorking to protect the legal rights, cultures and environments of Indian nations and other indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1978.About UsWe are a non-proﬁt law and advocacy organization.ContinueSubscribeSubscribe to Indigenous Notes for the latest news from the Center.Email:Take ActionHelp Support and Protect Indigenous Rights.ContinueAboutBoard of DirectorsStaffEmploymentInternshipsAnnual ReportsFinancial InformationContact UsIssuesEnding Violence Against Native WomenEnvironmental ProtectionHUMAN RIGHTSLAND RIGHTSLaw ReformNATIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF-GOVERNANCEPROTECTING SACRED SITESProjectsLAW REFORMMultilateral Development BanksThe American Declaration on The Rights of Indigenous PeoplesWorld Conference on Indigenous PeoplesContact UsMain Office602 North Ewing StreetHelena, MT 59601406.449.2006mt@indianlaw.orgD.C.
