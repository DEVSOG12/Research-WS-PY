In addition, indigenous leaders called for a special high-level conference to consult with indigenous peoples and members states on how best to implement and achieve the objectives of the Declaration.The American Declaration now stands as one of the most important instruments of the Inter-American human rights system. Both the Commission and the Court will interpret the Declaration to provide context to other instruments, such as the American Convention on Human Rights – the main regional human rights treaty – and the American Declaration on Rights and Duties of Man. This is particularly important when indigenous peoples are seeking recognition of treaty and land rights, protections for those in voluntary isolation or under internal armed conflicts, and protections for indigenous women, children, and families. The Indian Law Resource Center has participated in all of the negotiations on the development of the American Declaration to provide legal advice and support to indigenous representatives. The OAS is a regional intergovernmental organization of 35 member countries of the Americas, including the United States. Visit www.indianlaw.org to learn more about the Center’s work on the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.SiteWorking to protect the legal rights, cultures and environments of Indian nations and other indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1978.About UsWe are a non-proﬁt law and advocacy organization.ContinueSubscribeSubscribe to Indigenous Notes for the latest news from the Center.Email:Take ActionHelp Support and Protect Indigenous Rights.ContinueAboutBoard of DirectorsStaffEmploymentInternshipsAnnual ReportsFinancial InformationContact UsIssuesEnding Violence Against Native WomenEnvironmental ProtectionHUMAN RIGHTSLAND RIGHTSLaw ReformNATIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF-GOVERNANCEPROTECTING SACRED SITESProjectsLAW REFORMMultilateral Development BanksThe American Declaration on The Rights of Indigenous PeoplesWorld Conference on Indigenous PeoplesContact UsMain Office602 North Ewing StreetHelena, MT 59601406.449.2006mt@indianlaw.orgD.C.
