Nearly half of the U.S. prison population is now serving time for a violent offense, including assault and robbery.1)People with violent convictions comprised 55% of the 1.3 million people in state prisons in 2015 and 8% of the 173,000 people in federal prisons in 2016.

(2018). The meaning of life: The case for abolishing life sentences. New York: The New Press.For those who seek to end mass incarceration, there are signs of hope. In the past two decades, local, state, and federal lawmakers, governors, judges, and practitioners have rejected the death penalty, shortened excessive prison terms for violent convictions, scaled back collateral consequences, narrowed broad definitions of violence, and ended long term solitary confinement. The 15 reforms featured in this report, implemented in over 19 states, represent more effective, fiscally sound, and morally just responses to violence.5)In addition to the states listed in Table 1, this count also includes Delaware, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Washington, which outlawed the death penalty within the past two decades and were not otherwise counted. The report also references several other states that have reformed their juvenile life-without-parole sentencing policies or limited the transfer of youth into adult courts. While exceptions in a punitive era, these reforms serve as models for the future. For example:Rejecting torture in prisonIn 2017, Colorado Department of Corrections’ executive director Rick Raemisch restricted solitary confinement to only serious violations in prisons and set a maximum duration of 15 days.Using discretion to reduce extreme sentencesPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner seeks to end the city’s heavy reliance on life without parole (LWOP) sentences.6)Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office (2018, September 20).

The Court also later ruled that mandatory LWOP sentences for homicide failed to recognize young people’s “diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform.”8)Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012).

They are the next step of criminal justice reform and offer blueprints for policies that will better enable an end to mass incarceration within our lifetime.Table 1.

IntroductionA bipartisan consensus produced the main drivers of mass incarceration: The War on Drugs, longer prison sentences, and increased likelihood of imprisonment upon an arrest.10)Travis, J., Western, B., & Redburn, S. (Eds.) (2014). The growth of incarceration in the United States: Exploring causes and consequences. National Research Council. Washington, DC: National Academies Press. As a result the U.S. prison population grew from 315,000 people in 1980 to a peak of 1.6 million in 2009.11)Bureau of Justice Statistics Prisoners Series (1994-2016). An emerging bipartisan consensus is now seeking to correct this counterproductive response to crime and substance use disorders. Hard-won reforms in drug sentencing have reduced the number of people imprisoned for a drug offense by 22% between 2007 and 2015. 12)The number of people imprisoned for a property crime has fallen by 11% since 2007. Bureau of Justice Statistics Prisoners Series. Reforms have also helped to reduce the disparity in black-white imprisonment rates: African Americans experienced imprisonment at 7.3 times the rate of whites in 2000 versus 5.6 times in 2016.13)Based on data provided by Ashley Nellis. For state data, see Nellis, A. (2016). The color of justice: Racial and ethnic disparity in state prisons. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project.U.S. Prison Population by Offense, 1980-2015Note: Sentenced population in state and federal prisons. Reductions for each offense type are since peak year. The number of people imprisoned for a property crime has fallen by 11% since 2007.Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics Prisoners Series (1994-2016).Despite this progress, most policymakers and practitioners have yet to meaningfully scale back sentences for serious and violent crimes. The number of people imprisoned for a violent crime increased by over 300% between 1980 and 2009, when it reached its peak level of 740,000 people.14)Bureau of Justice Statistics Prisoners Series (1994-2016). By 2016, one quarter of people imprisoned for a violent crime were serving a life sentence.15)This includes life with and without the possibility of parole as well as a “virtual life” sentence of 50 years or longer. Nellis, A. (2017). Still life: America’s increasing use of life and long-term sentences. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project; Bureau of Justice Statistics Prisoners Series Prison terms have grown longer for this population despite evidence that long sentences: 1) incapacitate people in old age when they no longer pose a public safety threat, 2) have limited deterrent value since people who commit crimes do not expect to be caught, and 3) detract from more effective investments in public safety.16)Mauer, M., & Nellis, A. (2018). The meaning of life: The case for abolishing life sentences. New York: The New Press. These investments include expanding health insurance coverage to prevent and treat substance use disorder, expanding enrollment in high-quality early education to improve young people’s educational prospects, and promoting residential mobility programs to reduce neighborhood segregation.17)Ghandnoosh, N. (2017). Minimizing the maximum: The case for shortening all prison sentences. In C. Pettus-Davis & M. Epperson (Eds.), Smart decarceration: Achieving criminal justice transformation in the 21st century (pp. 137-159). New York: Oxford University Press. Given that long sentences for violent crimes place upward pressure on the entire sentencing structure, scaling back the most excessive penalties is key to ending mass incarceration.18)See also Mauer, M., & Cole, D. (2015, May 23). How to lock up fewer people. The New York Times; Pfaff, J. (2015, July 26). For true penal reform, focus on the violent offenders. The Washington Post; The Economist. (2015, July 20).

The number of people in prison serving a life sentence has yet to cease expanding.20)Nellis, A. (2017). Still life: America’s increasing use of life and long-term sentences. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project. In fact, some U.S. efforts to scale back prison sentences for lower level offenses have been coupled with measures to increase penalties for serious and violent crimes.21)Gottshalk, M. (2015). Caught: The prison state and the lockdown of American politics. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Seeds, C. (2017). Bifurcation nation: American penal policy in late mass incarceration. Punishment & Society, 19(5), 590-610. Lawmakers and practitioners have continued to impose long prison sentences for violent crimes even as 25 countries have experienced comparable crime drops to the United States, many without expanding levels of imprisonment.22)Beckett, K., Beach, L., Knaphus, E., & Reosti, A.

The champions of these reforms can be found in various branches of government, both sides of the political aisle, and in red and blue states. Driven by fiscal, moral, and evidence-based policymaking goals, they have overcome vehement opposition, shown that it is possible to undo excessive penalties for violent crimes while promoting public safety, and inspired others to follow suit. But their efforts remain too few. The Sentencing Project has estimated that at the existing pace of decarceration, it would take almost 75 years—until 2093—to cut the U.S. prison population in half.23)Ghandnoosh, N. (2018). Can we wait 75 years to cut the prison population in half? Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project. To end mass incarceration within our lifetime, criminal justice leaders and policymakers must expand and accelerate the pace of reforms like these.III. Rejecting Death and TortureThe Nationwide Decline of the Death PenaltyDeath sentences and executions have become uncommon in the United States, now imposed and carried out in only a small number of primarily Southern states. In fact, just 2% of U.S. counties have been responsible for the majority of executions since 1976.24)The same counties also hold the majority of today’s death row population and have imposed the majority of recent death sentences. Death Penalty Information Center (2013, October). The 2% death penalty: How a minority of counties produce most death cases at enormous costs to all. Washington, DC.The number of executions plummeted from an average of 167 annually during the 1930s to none in 1968 and for 10 of the next 12 years.25)Davis, E., & Snell, T.L. (2018, April). Capital Punishment, 2016. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The United States seemed poised to be at the “vanguard of abolition” of the death penalty in the late 1960s and a legal campaign by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund persuaded the Supreme Court to invalidate existing death penalty statutes in 1972, due to their discriminatory and capricious nature.26)Steiker, C.S., & Steiker, J.M. (2016). Courting death: The Supreme Court and capital punishment. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, p. 77. But the Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 in response to revised state statutes. The number of executions then expanded and contracted again under growing constitutional regulations, reaching neither the highs nor lows of the earlier period. Executions peaked at 98 in 1999, then fell to 25 in 2018.27)Similarly, new death sentences peaked at 315 in 1996 and fell to 42 in 2018. Death Penalty Information Center (2018a, January 30). Facts about the death penalty. Washington, DC; Davis & Snell, 2018; Death Penalty Information Center (2018b). The death penalty in 2018: Year end report. Washington, DC. Twenty states and the District of Columbia now outlaw the death penalty and while a majority of states and the federal government still authorize the practice, only 11 states have executed anyone in the past two years.28)In addition, nearly all American Indian tribes have rejected the option of pursuing the death penalty against their citizens for federal crimes committed on their land. Fonseca, F. (2017, August 21). Most American Indian tribes opt out of federal death penalty. The Associated Press; Death Penalty Information Center, 2013; Death Penalty Information Center, 2018b.Number of People Executed by U.S. State or Federal Authorities, 1930-2016Note: Excludes 160 executions carried out by military authorities from 1930 to 1961. Source: Davis, E., & Snell, T. L. (2018). Capital punishment, 2016. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Retrieved from https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ cp16sb.pdf.As crime rates rose between the 1970s and 1990s, policymakers responded to and stoked growing punitive sentiment, raising incarceration rates to unprecedented levels and reviving the death penalty. But both crime rates and executions have fallen since the late 1990s, though imprisonment levels kept expanding for another decade. Public support for the death penalty for people convicted of murder increased from a low of 42% in 1966 to a high of 80% in 1994, and gradually fell to 56% in 2018.29)A 2016 Pew survey found that support for the death penalty had fallen below 50%. Oliphant, B. (2016, September 29). Support for death penalty lowest in more than four decades. Pew Research Center; McCarthy, J. (2018, October 22). New low of 49% in U.S. say death penalty applied fairly. Gallup. When given a choice between a death sentence or life in prison without parole for someone convicted of murder, a minority of Americans now support the death sentence.30)Note also vast racial disparities in support for the death penalty: Ghandnoosh, N. (2014). Race and punishment: Racial perceptions of crime and support for punitive policies. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project; Berman, M. (2018, June 11). American support for the death penalty inches up, poll finds. The Washington Post; Ergun, D. (2014, June 5). New Low in Preference for the Death Penalty. ABC News.The Supreme Court’s constitutional regulatory structure around capital punishment has responded to and helped to shape public sentiment, while changing international and corporate norms have reduced access to lethal injection drugs. Growing constitutional protections have also dramatically increased the cost of carrying out executions and have enabled the exoneration of 164 innocent people on death row between 1973 and 2018—facts that have propelled many governors, courts, and legislatures to reject the death penalty as an inhumane, ineffective, and unfair form of punishment.31)Death Penalty Information Center. (n.d.). Last exoneration November 5, 2018 (#164). Washington, DC.After reinstating the death penalty in 1976 (Gregg v. Georgia), the Supreme Court erected additional procedural safeguards and required individualized sentencing.32)Steiker, C.S., & Steiker, J.M. (2016). Courting death: The Supreme Court and capital punishment. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, p. 77. In addition, in a series of cases responding to the “evolving standards of decency”—which were based on state statues, jury verdicts, professional opinion, international norms, and polling data—the Supreme Court gradually narrowed the crimes and people for whom death could be sought.33)Steiker, C. S., & Steiker, J. M. (2011, September 27). Why death penalty opponents are closer to their goal than they realize. The New Republic. This included prohibiting capital punishment for certain crimes such as for raping an adult woman (Coker v. Georgia, 1997) and later for most crimes other than homicide (Kennedy v. Louisiana, 2008). This narrowing also included barring capital punishment for individuals who are intellectually disabled (Atkins v. Virginia, 2002) or under the age of 18 (Roper v. Simmons, 2005).34)Key professional associations including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, and the American Bar Association have called for also exempting the severely mentally ill from executions. Death Penalty Information Center, 2018a. Yet legal scholars Carol and Jordan Steiker caution that because of the undemanding standard of enforcement in constitutional regulation of the death penalty, “the last four decades have produced a complicated regulatory apparatus that achieves extremely modest goals while maximizing political and legal discomfort.”35)Steiker, C.S., & Steiker, J.M. (2016). Courting death: The Supreme Court and capital punishment. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, p. 77.While 2018’s level of executions was one-quarter of that in 1999, three problems remain. First, the United States remains the only Western democracy still using the death penalty, with 2,738 people on death row in 2018.36)Death Penalty Information Center (2018b). The death penalty in 2018: Year end report. Washington, DC. This continued practice runs counter to the position of faith organizations including the Catholic Church—which now works towards the worldwide abolition of a practice that is “an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person”—and is against the recommendation of legal experts including the American Law Institute—which in 2009 removed the death penalty from its set of permissible forms of punishment for murder.37)Steiker, C. S., & Steiker, J. M. (2010). No more tinkering: The American Law Institute and the death penalty provisions of the Model Penal Code. Texas Law Review, 89(353); Holy See Press Office (2018, February 2). New revision of number 2267 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church on the death penalty – Rescriptum “ex Audentia SS.mi”.Second, the death penalty continues to be applied in a racially biased manner. Black defendants are more likely than their white counterparts to be charged with crimes eligible for capital punishment, to be convicted, and to be sentenced to death. Racial disparities in death case are most prevalent when the defendant is black and the victim is white.38)5 Fagan, F., & Geller, A. (in progress). Police, race, and the production of capital homicides. June 25 2018 draft. The Supreme Court’s narrowed definition of unconstitutional racial bias in capital sentencing, to that which can be proven to be intentional (McCleskey v. Kemp, 1987), has prolonged this problem.Lastly, the movement to abolish the death penalty has contributed to a dramatic expansion of life-without-parole sentences, as statutes and charging practices have “enhanced use of such sentences well beyond the numbers that would be generated if it were only an ‘alternative’ to the death penalty.”39)Mauer & Nellis, 2018, p. 161 (emphasis in original); see also Steiker & Steiker, 2016. Over 50,000 people were serving parole-ineligible life sentences in 2016, over four times the number in 1992.40)In 2016, an additional 44,000 people were serving “virtual life” sentences, of 50 years or longer, and nearly 109,000 were serving parole-eligible life sentences.

The facts of life imprisonment: 1 in 7 people in prison is serving a life sentence. The dramatic growth in the number of people sentenced to die in prison underscores the need for recognizing, as Pope Francis told Congress in 2015, “that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.”41)Pope Francis (2015).

Using Discretion to Reduce Extreme SentencesCalifornia Governor Eases Life Sentences through Parole and CommutationRecent California governors have had an unusual amount of authority in determining prison terms for serious violent crimes. Jerry Brown was the first to extensively use this power to alleviate excessive sentences. In a state that leads the nation in the size of its parole-eligible lifer population—with over 34,000 individuals in 2016—governors have since the 1980s been able to reverse or modify the parole board’s decisions regarding this population.82)Nellis, A.

(2017). Delaying a second chance: The declining prospects for parole on life sentences. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project. While his predecessors reversed over half (54%) of all parole grants for lifers between 1991 and 2010, Brown reversed only 12% by 2018.83)Due to data limitations, this rate excludes gubernatorial modifications of the parole board’s decisions and requests for en banc reviews.

The governor also appointed parole board commissioners who dramatically increased the state’s low parole grant rate, commuted a number of parole-ineligible life sentences, and helped to pass laws that would give convicted youth a more meaningful chance at parole and narrow the imposition of life sentences (see Sections 6 and 8 in this report).84)Ghandnoosh, 2017; Ulloa, J.

Los Angeles Times.“Many people in today’s society do not believe in either forgiveness or redemption… They believe that what you do is who you are. That philosophy is not something that I share.”—Jerry Brown, Former Governor of CaliforniaA former Jesuit seminarian, Brown’s approach was driven by moral conviction and concerns about the counterproductive effects of excessive prison terms as well as their cost. Although during his first tenure as California governor beginning in the 1970s he approved legislation that contributed to mass incarceration, and he later defended prison overcrowding as Attorney General in the 2000s, in his second gubernatorial term he led the state to become a leader in decarceration.85)Mauer, M., & Ghandnoosh, N.

The commutations were often limited to extending parole eligibility to people sentenced to life without the possibility of parole (who total over 5,000 in the state) or expediting parole eligibility dates. Some commutations shortened the length of a prison term and led to immediate release. “Many people in today’s society do not believe in either forgiveness or redemption,” said Brown. “They believe that what you do is who you are. That philosophy is not something that I share. I don’t think it’s Christian … and it does not comport with historical notions of justice.”87)Egelko, B. (2018, December 24). Gov.

But some have shown mercy, even to people convicted of serious violent crimes. These include:ArkansasDuring his decade as governor of Arkansas beginning in 1996, Mike Huckabee granted 1,058 pardons and commutations—including to people with violent convictions. A former Baptist minister, Huckabee sought to honor redemption and correct unfairness. He defended these decisions when they came under scrutiny during his presidential bids.

Huckabee defends himself from Romney, says Arkansas executions prove he’s tough on crime. In 2009, Huckabee again defended his clemency record after someone whose sentence he commuted allegedly killed four police officers. He explained that he could not have made a better decision at the time of the commutation given the information that he had. The man’s crime of robbery and burglary at age 16 would typically result in a sentence of a few years, “but because he was a young black kid, he got 108 years!” Huckabee explained.94)Bacon, P.

The program is run by Common Justice, a local organization that offers alternatives-to-incarceration and victim-services programs. Consenting survivors who participate seek to reach agreements with the responsible party to address the harm that they experienced and to develop non-carceral strategies of accountability. This may include restitution, extensive community service, and commitments to attend school and work, and includes the completion of a 12- to 15-month intensive violence intervention program. Through this approach, Common Justice aims to “repair rather than sever communal ties in the aftermath of serious crime.”127)Common Justice. (n.d.). Common Justice Model; see also Sered, D. 2019.

Recognizing the Rehabilitative Potential of Youth and Young AdultsSupreme Court and States Limit Life-Without-Parole Sentences for YouthFour U.S. Supreme Court rulings from the past fifteen years have sharply limited the most severe punishments for people under age 18. Under Roper v. Simmons (2005), youth cannot be sentenced to death.128)Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005).  At the time, 12 states banned the death penalty in all instances and 18 others banned it for juveniles.129)Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005). Roper left life without parole as the harshest punishment for youth (including for those previously sentenced to death). Five years later, Graham v. Florida limited juvenile life without parole to homicide convictions (requiring a new sentence for youth sentenced to life without parole for non-homicide offenses).130)Graham v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010).  Graham did not require states to guarantee eventual freedom for young people convicted of non-homicide crimes, but it did entitle them to a “meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.”131)Graham v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010).Bryan Stevenson, founder and executive director of Equal Justice Initiative, successfully argued Miller v. Alabama (2012), in which the Supreme Court ruled that the mandatory imposition of a life-without-parole sentence for homicide is a cruel and unusual sentence for youth under age 18. Photograph courtesy of the Equal Justice Initiative.As of 2012, more than 2,500 people were serving life without parole for crimes committed before turning 18. Disproportionately people of color, roughly two-thirds of these individuals were convicted in just five states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, California, and Louisiana.132)Data on file In Miller v. Alabama (2012), the Court ruled that the mandatory imposition of a life-without-parole sentence for homicide is a cruel and unusual sentence for a juvenile.133)Miller v. Alabama and Jackson v. Hobbs, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012). The discretionary imposition of the sentence is still constitutional, wherein trial courts consider mitigating factors of youth prior to issuing it. This mandatory/discretionary distinction is important because courts have been reticent to impose life without parole to juveniles when given an alternative: more than three-quarters of juveniles received the sentence as a mandatory minimum.134)Ford, M. (2017, July 14). The reckoning over young prisoners serving life without parole. The Atlantic.Prior to Miller, only a handful of states had banned juvenile life without parole (“JLWOP”), though several others rarely or never used it. Sixteen additional states and the District of Columbia have banned JLWOP since the ruling, either through legislation or state Supreme Court rulings, bringing the total to 21 states and DC that have banned its use.Miller set in motion many resentencings, though some states were slow in ensuring parole eligibility to say nothing of granting parole. A key question remained as to the retroactivity of Miller, made more pressing by negative state supreme court decisions in those states most prone to impose life without parole sentences on youth. In Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), the Court found Miller applied retroactively, meaning that any person who had received life without parole as a mandatory sentence while a juvenile was entitled to reconsideration of his or her sentence.135)Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016).Twenty-nine states have passed reforms to amend their juvenile sentences for homicide since the Miller rulings and some state Supreme Courts have interpreted the new strictures on youth sentencing broadly.136)Rovner, J. (2018). Juvenile life without parole: An overview. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled that all mandatory sentences for youth are unconstitutional.137)State v. Lyle, 854 N.W.2d 378 (Iowa 2014).The new laws specify the ways that a young person’s personal history should be used to mitigate their sentence, such as under Missouri’s SB 590 (2016) and West Virginia’s HB 4210 (2014). States including California and New York require their parole boards to weigh the significance of youth in parole hearings (see Sections 6 and 7). The other key feature is shorter time periods prior to parole eligibility. In Nevada and West Virginia juveniles convicted of homicide can be eligible for parole after serving 15 years.138)AB 218 (2017). South Dakota law offers no guidance for juveniles convicted of homicide, leaving the sentence to judicial discretion.139)SB 140 (2016). The limits of these reforms are highlighted by the case of Henry Montgomery himself, the named plaintiff in the Supreme Court’s landmark decision. Though eligible, he was denied parole by the Louisiana parole board in February 2018, even after spending over 50 years in prison.140)Toohey, G. (2018, February 19). Board denies parole to man who served more than 50 years after killing deputy when he was juvenile. The Advocate.The Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth reported 1,100 people are still serving life without parole for offenses committed under age 18 following the legislation that passed in Miller’s wake and the resentencings that followed.141)Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth (2018). Tipping point: A majority of states abandon life-without-parole sentences for children. Washington, DC. The Sentencing Project has estimated that about 7,000 others are serving parole-eligible life sentences for crimes committed before age 18 and 2,000 more are serving virtual life sentences, defined as 50 years or longer.142)Nellis, A. (2017). Still life: America’s increasing use of life and long-term sentences. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project. In 2016, over three-quarters of people serving a life sentence (including virtual life) for a juvenile offense were people of color.143)Nellis, A. (2017). Still life: America’s increasing use of life and long-term sentences. Washington, DC: The Sentencing Project.States Reduce Transfers of Youth to Adult CourtsWhile most states handle offenses committed by youth under age 18 in juvenile courts, all allow serious youth offenses to be transferred to adult courts. This occurs either through laws requiring certain offenses be tried in adult courts or through the discretion granted to juvenile court judges or prosecutors to select those youth, within certain parameters, who will be tried in adult courts. Juvenile transfer laws are so wide-ranging that, as of 2016, all but four states allowed even drug charges to be tried in adult courts.144)Rovner, J. (2016). How tough on crime became tough on kids: Prosecuting teenage drug charges in adult courts. Washington, DC: Sentencing Project. However, recent legislative reforms, in nearly a dozen states including Connecticut, Illinois, Utah, and Vermont, have limited transfers by raising the minimum transfer age and by limiting the offenses for which youth can be charged as if they were adults. These reforms, along with declines in youth offending, have sharply decreased the number of youth charged as if they were adults. By 2015, approximately 9,200 youth under age 18 were prosecuted as adults through transfer laws, judicial waivers, or prosecutorial discretion.145)An additional 66,700 youth cases were prosecuted in adult criminal courts based on the lower juvenile jurisdiction cutoff age in nine states.

(2013). Did changes in juvenile sanctions reduce juvenile crime rates? A natural experiment. Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law, 11, 57-69. In fact, a systematic review of scientific studies found increased reoffending among those youth who had been tried as adults compared to those tried as juveniles for similar offenses.147)Hahn, R., McGowan, A., Liberman, A., et al. (2007). Effects on violence of laws and policies facilitating the transfer of juveniles from the juvenile justice system to the adult justice system: A systematic review. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 32(4), 7-28.Transferring youth to the adult system exposes them to an array of well-documented damaging consequences. An adult conviction carries harsher punishment and imposes an array of collateral consequences since it is more difficult to expunge adult records than juvenile records. If incarcerated in an adult prison, youth receive inferior rehabilitative programming and poorer education than in juvenile facilities. Youth in adult facilities are also at greater risk of harm from themselves or other imprisoned individuals and guards than youth in juvenile facilities.148)Hartney, C. (2006). Youth under age 18 in the adult criminal justice system. National Council on Crime and Delinquency.Youth of color are especially likely to experience the negative consequences of being transferred to adult courts, although data on juvenile transfers and their racial composition are incomplete, particularly for non-judicial waivers. The federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention estimates that among the small subset of transfers that followed a hearing in juvenile court, youth of color comprise 66% of such transfers despite comprising 57% of delinquency cases.149)Puzzanchera, C., & Hockenberry, S. (2018). National disproportionate minority contact databook. The National Center for Juvenile Justice for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Burns Institute’s review of prosecutorial waivers in California showed even worse disparities when the decision to prosecute in adult courts was made by District Attorneys, research that helped end the practice in that state.150)Ridolfi, L., Washburn, M., & Guzman, F. (2016). The prosecution of youth as adults. Center on Juvenile & Criminal Justice, National Center for Youth Law and W. Haywood Burns Institute.States have limited the transfer of young people into adult courts through two key types of reforms, to which the Campaign for Youth Justice has been instrumental.151)This section relies heavily on the Campaign for Youth Justice’s research, specifically: Thomas, J. (2018). Raising the bar: State trends in keeping youth out of adult courts, 2015-2017. One approach has been to raise the minimum age at which a transfer is permitted. Vermont raised its minimum transfer age from 10 to 12, Kansas from 12 to 14, and Connecticut and New Jersey from 14 to 15.152)See respectively: H95 (2016), SB 267 (2015), HB 7050 (2015), and S2003 (2015). Fourteen-year olds in those states can still be transferred, but only after a hearing in juvenile court. Illinois raised its minimum automatic transfer age from 15 to 16.153)HB 3718 (2015). As in Connecticut, adult trials are still an option for Illinois’s 15-year olds, but a transfer hearing must take place. California, Delaware, and Texas passed procedural reforms that have the potential to send more youth cases to juvenile courts despite starting in adult criminal courts.A second set of reforms has limited the offenses for which youth can be charged as adults. Illinois no longer automatically charges youth as adults on certain gun-related theft charges and Utah sharply limited the list of charges that are automatically sent to criminal courts.154)See respectively: HB 3718 (2015) and SB 167 (2015). Indiana now allows for reverse waivers to return youth to the juvenile courts.155)SB 160 (2016). Voters passed procedural reforms in California to limit the power of prosecutors to send youth to adult courts, as did Vermont’s legislature.156)See respectively: Proportion 57 (2016) and H95 (2016).Another avenue for reform has been allowing a second look at lengthy sentences imposed on juveniles. In Louisiana and Connecticut people given lengthy terms as youth are entitled to a sentencing review.157)See respectively: Act 467 (2018) and Public Act 15-84 (2015). Following passage of the law, Rachel Gassert of the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights noted, “Keeping rehabilitated kids locked up serves no purpose other than to punish them, which is not what the juvenile system is meant to do.”158)Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights. (2018). Victory! Governor signs bill to limit mandatory sentences for youth.Raise the AgeNationwide, arrested adolescents under age 18 are typically charged in juvenile courts and those 18 years and older are charged as adults. But states that are exceptions to this rule have generated the bulk of criminal prosecutions of youth under age 18: 66,700 cases in 2015.159)Puzzanchera, C., & Hockenberry, S. (2018). National disproportionate minority contact databook. The National Center for Juvenile Justice for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Two decades ago, there was more variety in these age boundaries: thirteen states routinely charged 17-year olds as if they were adults, including three that did so for 16-year old arrestees.160)National Center for Juvenile Justice. Jurisdictional boundaries. Accessed Jan. 16, 2019. More recently, these states have passed legislation to raise the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 18, though the implementation of these laws means the reforms are still underway. Between 2007 and 2014, these reforms helped to cut in half the number of youth under age 18 excluded from the juvenile justice system because of their state’s low cutoff age for juvenile jurisdiction.161)Justice Policy Institute. (2017). Raising the Age: Shifting to a safer and more effective juvenile justice system. Washington, DC. By the end of 2018, only Georgia, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin had yet to pass laws to keep most adolescents under age 18 in juvenile courts. In 2018, Vermont became the first state to add 18- and 19-year-olds into the juvenile system, excluding those charged with serious violent crimes.162)Act 201. Prior to 1993, Wyoming charged 18-year olds in juvenile court. See: Butts, J., & Roman, J. (2014). Line drawing: Raising the minimum age of criminal court jurisdiction in New York.

These findings suggest that the age of juvenile court jurisdiction, generally ending at 18, is outdated.

Why 21 year-old offenders should be tried in family court. The Washington Post. Political barriers, even in progressive states, have thus far prevented raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction further into adolescence.For much of his second term, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy attempted to convince the legislature to include older adolescents (those under age 21) in the juvenile courts.164)Malloy, D.

CREDIT: Karsten Moran for The Marshall ProjectCalifornia Grants Youth and Young Adults More Meaningful Parole HearingsBased on scientific evidence showing that adolescent brains are not fully mature until people reach their mid-to-late 20s, the California Legislature has created “Youth Offender Parole Hearings” to give greater weight to the diminished culpability of youth and young adults serving lengthy sentences and to emphasize their potential for growth and maturity. Senate Bill 260, which went into effect in 2014, applied this reform to youth under the age of 18 who were convicted as adults.170)This law does not apply to certain cases including those sentenced under the “Three Strikes” law or to life without the possibility of parole.

The 109 individuals who had such hearings in the first six months of 2014 had served an average of 24.7 years in prison. But in the first four months of 2015, the parole board granted parole to youth offenders at a lower rate than it did to their adult-convicted counterparts. This disparity may have occurred because some individuals convicted as youth had not yet sufficiently participated in programming to demonstrate their rehabilitation prior to their expedited parole hearings.179)Caldwell, B.

State courts have repeatedly chastised the parole board for failing to follow the law in its decisions. With pressure from the courts, advocates, and the Governor, the board finally proposed new regulations in 2016 to comply with the 2011 statutory requirements. This change, coupled with the appointment of several new parole board members, helped to increase the parole grant rate for people serving life sentences from 27% to 37% during comparable periods between 2017 and 2018.182)The time periods for this comparison were from September 2016 to January 2017 and the same months in in 2017 and 2018.

Hard-Won Parole Board Reforms Under Attack in New York (Updated). Rewire.News.The Legislature’s 2011 parole statute requires the board to:183)N.Y. Executive Law § 259-c(4).establish written procedures for its use in making parole decisions as required by law. Such written procedures shall incorporate risk and needs principles to measure the rehabilitation of persons appearing before the board, the likelihood of success of such persons upon release, and assist members of the state board of parole in determining which inmates may be released to parole supervision.According to Philip Genty, professor at Columbia Law School, these changes sought to “shift the primary focus of Parole Board decisionmaking away from the static factors of criminal history and seriousness of the crime, to a more dynamic and nuanced set of risk-assessment ‘procedures.’”184)Hearings before the N.Y.S. Assembly’s Standing Committee on Correction, 2013 Leg. (N.Y.) (testimony of Philip M. Genty, Professor, Columbia Law School). But the board resisted implementing these reforms. In testimony before the Assembly’s Corrections Committee in 2013, the Correctional Association of New York stated that the board “denies parole release, often repeatedly to far too many people, frequently based on the nature of applicants’ crimes of conviction or past criminal history while failing to consider people’s accomplishments, readiness for reentry, or objective risk.”185)Hearings before the N.Y.S. Assembly’s Standing Committee on Correction, 2013 Leg. (N.Y.) (testimony of Scott Paltrowitz, Prison Vision Project). State courts have chastised the board for failing to follow laws guiding parole decisionmaking, and the board has twice been held in contempt of court for ignoring directives to give greater weight to factors other than the underlying offense and to provide its reasoning behind parole denials.186)Bedell, B.

(2016, October 18). For the case motivating this reform, see Hawkins v. DOCCS 140 A.D.3d 34 (3rd Dept. 2016). In 2017, Governor Cuomo also appointed six new parole board commissioners, “many of whom more closely reflect the identities and experiences of people in prison, and come from a broader range of professional backgrounds,” according to The Release Aging People in Prison (RAPP) Campaign.191)The Parole Preparation Project & The Release Aging People in Prison Campaign (2018).

He was sentenced to 25 years to life for killing police officer Matthew Giglio during a robbery attempt in 1975. By age 70, he had served over 40 years in prison, having been denied parole 10 times. Despite becoming a model person in prison with many supporting his release—including the New York Times editorial board, the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany, and a state judge who held the board in contempt for its unwillingness to evaluate MacKenzie’s rehabilitation—the parole board issued its 10th parole denial in 2016.192)New York Times Editorial Board.

Correcting Overly Broad Definitions of Violent CrimeSupreme Court Narrows the Federal Armed Career Criminal ActIn 2015, the Supreme Court limited the reach of The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). The law imposed a mandatory 15-year sentence on anyone convicted of possessing a gun or ammunition who has three prior convictions for a “violent felony” or a “serious drug offense.”196)Under previous law, 10 years was the statutory maximum sentence for this offense. Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. (2015). The ACCA defined a violent felony to include burglary, arson, and extortion as well as a residual category including any crime that “involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another” and could be punishable by a one-year prison term. In an 8-1 decision in Johnson v. United States, the Court struck down the ACCA’s residual clause for being unconstitutionally vague. In 2016, the Supreme Court held that this decision would apply retroactively to individuals seeking reviews of previously imposed sentences.197)Welch v. United States, 578 U.S. (2016).Reflecting on the residual clause after the Supreme Court decision, Ohio State University law professor Douglas A. Berman explained: “If a prosecutor really wants to slam a guy with a long record, they have an interest in portraying any and every part of that history as qualifying.”198)Marimow, A. E. (2016, June 24). One of Scalia’s final opinions will shorten some federal prison sentences. The Washington Post. The United States Sentencing Commission had previously underscored the lack of clarity in the ACCA, noting in particular that the ACCA “can apply to offenders who served no or minimal terms of imprisonment for their predicate offenses, further increasing the potential for inconsistent application insofar as the penalty may be viewed as excessively severe in those cases.”199)United States Sentencing Commission. (2011). 2011 report to the Congress: Mandatory minimum penalties in the federal criminal justice system. P. 363. The Commission estimated that between 2013 and 2016, the Johnson decision and reforms in federal charging practices contributed to reducing the number of people convicted under the ACCA from 582 to 304.200)United States Sentencing Commission. (2018). Mandatory minimum penalties for firearm offenses in the federal criminal justice system.In addition to calling for more clarity on the statutory definitions in the ACCA, the Sentencing Commission has recommended that Congress reduce the severity of the mandatory sentence.201)Saris, P.B. (2015). Statement of Judge Patti B. Saris. Chair, United States Sentencing Commission for the Hearing on “H.R. 3713, Sentencing Reform Act of 2015” Before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The Commission estimated that reducing the ACCA’s mandatory penalty from 15 to 10 years, as the Sentencing Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 3713) would have done, would reduce the sentences of 277 people per year and if applied retroactively, could reduce the sentences of up to 2,317 people in federal prisons.202)Contrary to the Sentencing Commission’s assessment, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and then-Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced legislation to expand the reach of the ACCA by replacing the concepts of “violent felony” and “serious drug offense” in the law with “serious felony,” which would be defined as any crime punishable by 10 years or more.

(2017-2018). SB-1437 Accomplice liability for felony murder. The resulting penalty would be death, life without parole, or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. In September 2018, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill (SB) 1437 into law, limiting felony murder prosecutions to those who intended to kill, had a direct role in a murder, intentionally assisted the killer, or played a major role in the underlying felony and “acted with reckless indifference to human life.”207)Cases involving the killing of a police office are excluded from the reform. California Legislative Information. (2017-2018). SB-1437 Accomplice liability for felony murder. The law is retroactive, allowing those previously convicted to petition for resentencing.California’s new felony murder bill was a bipartisan effort by Democratic State Senator Nancy Skinner and Republican State Senator Joel Anderson. Lawmakers in support of the bill said the previous law was outdated and unfairly applied lengthy sentences to people who did not kill anyone.208)Ulloa, J. (2018, September 30). California sets new limits on who can be charged with felony murder. Los Angeles Times. Proponents also stressed that the previous felony murder rule unfairly punished women, young people, and people of color. Approximately three-quarters of women imprisoned under California’s felony murder were not the killers and the average age of people sentenced under the law is 20 years old.209)Among surveyed men imprisoned under California’s felony murder law, 55% were not the “trigger person.” Correspondence with Kate Chatfield at Re:store Justice; Ulloa, 2018.

Scaling Back Collateral ConsequencesCongress Largely Upholds Food Stamps Access for People with Violent ConvictionsAs part of 1996’s “Welfare Reform,” Congress required states to ban people with felony drug convictions from accessing federal cash assistance and food stamps. Over a dozen states have used the bill’s provision to fully opt out of both of these bans, and 30 others and the District of Columbia have chosen to at least partly opt out of one ban.214)Thompson, D. (2019, January). No more double punishments: Lifting the ban on SNAP and TANF for people with prior felony drug convictions. Washington, DC: CLASP. Despite state-level reforms to scale back collateral consequences and the federal government’s support for re-entry through the Second Chance Act in 2007 and its reauthorization in 2018, Congress has repeatedly considered excluding people with certain violent convictions from food stamps eligibility.In 2013, the Senate unanimously approved then-Senator David Vitter of Louisiana’s amendment to the Farm Bill, imposing a lifetime ban on food stamps eligibility for people with certain violent convictions (including sexual assault, murder, and particular crimes against children.) The restriction on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would have been retroactive, denying nutritional assistance to people who long ago completed their sentences. States would not have the option to opt out of the ban.While some lawmakers had suggested that the Vitter Amendment would deter crime, advocates countered that “if the threat of prison does not keep people from offending, it’s hard to see how a ban on assistance following incarceration has a deterrent effect.”215)Haile, J. (2014, February 4). How Senator Vitter lost his food fight. HuffPost; Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference. (n.d.).

Photograph courtesy of Gavin Glakas, 2018.Virginia is one of only four states in the nation—along with Florida, Iowa, and Kentucky—to disenfranchise all individuals with felony convictions for life, unless they can secure a pardon from the governor. As a result of the state’s restrictive policy, 8% of all adult Virginians were unable to vote due to a felony conviction in 2016, as were 22% of voting-age black Virginians.223)Uggen, C., Larson, R., & Shannon, S.

Governor McAuliffe restores voting and civil rights to over 200,000 Virginians. He intended to issue additional orders to reenfranchise those who completed their sentence before he left office in 2018. In July 2016, the state’s Republican leaders successfully persuaded the state Supreme Court to overturn the executive order, on the grounds that it exceeded gubernatorial authority by restoring voting rights en masse instead of individually. McAuliffe responded with an individualized process for voting-rights restoration which withstood further court challenge and reenfranchised over 173,000 people before he left office.225)Figure received via direct contact with Office of the Governor on September 14th, 2018.McAuliffe, who had campaigned on this issue, had previously taken steps to streamline the process for voting rights restoration, including reducing the waiting period for applying from five to three years for people convicted of a violent crime and eliminating the waiting period for those with a drug conviction.226)Nolan, J.

ConclusionThere comes a point where you really have to ask yourself if we have achieved the societal end in keeping these people in prison for so long. Is the societal cost and expenditure worth it to keep somebody who’s older — higher medical costs and the like — in prison? This is a conversation this country really needs to have.”—U.S. Senator Cory Booker, 2016239)Lopez, G. (2016, May 17). Cory Booker: Senate bill is “in my lifetime the first reversal of mass incarceration.” Vox; see also Lustbader, S., & Gullapalli, V. (2019, February 6). “Special Edition: Will Cory Booker continue talking about second chances for people convicted of violent crimes?” Email from The Appeal.Excessive penalties for violent crimes are not only ineffective—incapacitating people who no longer pose a public safety threat and producing little deterrent effect—they also divert investment from more effective public safety programs. These facts have been borne out by criminological research and criminal justice practice, including the reforms described in this report. This is why Rick Raemisch, executive director of Colorado’s Department of Corrections, credited his department’s reduced reliance on solitary confinement with helping to reduce violence against prison staff and for promoting safer returns to communities. This is why reductions in executions and restrictions in juvenile life-without-parole sentences have not stalled the nationwide decline in violent crime rates. This is why the Ungers, a subset of Maryland’s lifer population who gained their release through the courts, have a recidivism rate that is well below the state’s average. These successful reforms underscore the need to consider the human and fiscal costs of excessive punishment and to rely on evidence, rather than emotion, to invest effectively in public safety.Given that nearly half of the U.S. prison population is serving time for a violent offense, policymakers, criminal justice practitioners, and courts will need to build on the models presented here to end mass incarceration. For some jurisdictions, this requires ending their outlier status. This was the case, for example, with Louisiana’s elimination of non-unanimous jury verdicts, Florida’s restoration of voting rights to people who had completed their term of prison, jail, or community supervision, and Mississippi’s reduction of its truth-in-sentencing requirement for most violent crimes. Potential future reforms in this vein would include the abolition of the death penalty in the handful of states that continue to impose the sentence, the elimination of gubernatorial review of parole decisions in California and Maryland, and raising the age of criminal responsibility to 18 in Texas, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Michigan.But catching up with other states is insufficient given that penalties for violent crimes are excessive nationwide. Leadership on this issue has taken at least three forms. First, reforms have incrementally carved out certain crimes and certain people from excessive penalties. This has been the case with nationwide reforms honoring the rehabilitative potential of youth and young adults, promulgated by the Supreme Court and notably advanced in California. The next step in addressing crimes committed by youth is to recognize the difference between adolescence and adulthood, regardless of the seriousness of the offense. Young people are more amenable to rehabilitation and, as such, should not be burdened with harsh penalties that do not consider their immaturity. States should eliminate mandatory minimums for youth, as Iowa has done, and raise the age of criminal responsibility into later adolescence.Second, leaders have advanced legislation to scale back excessive penalties for all. This has been the case with states that have abolished the death penalty and in New York State, where the courts and governor have pressured the parole board to follow the legislature’s requirement to give greater weight to risk assessments in parole decisions, rather than focusing on the original crime and criminal history. The Sentencing Project has called on policymakers to expand on these efforts and abolish life imprisonment, setting maximum prison terms to 20 years.240)The Sentencing Project. (n.d.). Campaign to End Life Imprisonment. Washington, DC.Third, leaders have used their discretionary authority to take bold action to end unjust penalties. Examples here include Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner’s case-by-case evaluations to make resentencing offers in juvenile life-without-parole cases and his intention to not overcharge in homicide cases, California Governor Jerry Brown’s commutation of a number of parole-ineligible life sentences, and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe’s restoration of voting rights to people regardless of their conviction offense. Prosecutors can use evidence and experience to scale back the penalties they seek while governors, and the president, can return to the tradition of using executive clemency powers to correct past injustices. Only bold leadership like this will end mass incarceration within our lifetime.Footnotes[+] Footnotes↑1 People with violent convictions comprised 55% of the 1.3 million people in state prisons in 2015 and 8% of the 173,000 people in federal prisons in 2016.
