Despite a steady drop in juvenile detention over the past decade, there are still far too many young people securely detained for first‐time, nonviolent offenses that would not be illegal if committed by an adult (i.e., status offenses such as truancy).Nationwide each year, police make 2.1 million juvenile arrests; 1.7 million cases are referred to juvenile courts; and over 200,000 youth are prosecuted in the adult criminal justice system. On any given night, approximately 81,000 youth are confined in juvenile facilities, and 10,000 children are held in adult jails and prisons. Incarcerated youth are particularly vulnerable to victimization and abuse by peers, older inmates, and staff. Also, the United States is alone in imposing the sentence of life without parole for crimes committed when under the age of 18. Recent estimates find that 2,589 people are currently serving a juvenile life without parole sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile.Current juvenile justice practices often ignore children’s amenability to rehabilitation, cause long‐term collateral consequences, waste taxpayer dollars, and violate our deepest held principles about equal justice under the law and the role of the juvenile justice system. Our system demonstrates racial and ethnic disparities, lacks sound mental health and drug treatment services, and applies excessively harsh sanctions for minor and nonviolent adolescent misbehavior.With strong federal leadership, reforms are possible. Research over the past 20 years has increased our understanding of what works, and how to best approach juvenile delinquency and system reform. Promising reforms are being implemented in many jurisdictions across the country, and there is an increasingly clear path for moving toward evidence‐based approaches to reducing adolescent crime. The Obama Administration has the opportunity to restore an effective system of juvenile justice for our youth.This report was produced by the National Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Coalition (NJJDPC), which brings together a collaborative array of youth- and family-serving, social justice, law enforcement, corrections, and faith-based organizations to ensure healthy families, build strong communities, and improve public safety by promoting fair and effective policies, practices and programs for youth involved or at risk of becoming involved in the juvenile and criminal justice systems.To read the report, download the PDF below.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationRacial JusticeYouth JusticeRelated PostspublicationsOctober 25, 2022Locked Out 2022: Estimates of People Denied Voting RightsChristopher Uggen, Ryan Larson, Sarah Shannon, and Robert StewartAn estimated 4.6 million Americans are barred from voting due to a felony conviction.Download PDFRead OnlinenewsOctober 03, 2022October is Youth Justice Action Month!October is Youth Justice Action Month! Our network of allied advocates and supporters use this month to celebrate the actions we’ve taken in the movement to end youth incarceration and provide all youth with the support they need to thrive.Youth JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up1 in 3Black men born in 2001 can expect to go to prison in their lifetimeMore FactsTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
