At the same time, policymakers have largely neglected to address the staggering number of people serving life sentences, comprising one of seven people in prisons nationwide. International comparisons document the extreme nature of these developments. The United States now holds an estimated 40% of the world population serving life imprisonment and 83% of those serving life without the possibility of parole. The expansion of life imprisonment has been a key component of the development of mass incarceration.In this report, we present a closer look at the rise in life sentences amidst the overall incarceration expansion.To place the growth of life imprisonment in perspective, the national lifer population of 206,000 now exceeds the size of the entire prison population in 1970, just prior to the prison population explosion of the following four decades. In 24 states, there are now more people serving life sentences than were in the entire prison population in 1970,1)Prison population data was not available for Alaska, Arkansas, and Rhode Island in 1970, so for these states we use prison populationdata for 1971. and in an additional nine states, the life imprisonment total is within 100 people of the 1970 prison population.Figure 1. Comparison of Life Sentenced-Population in 2016 to Prison Population in 1970A misinterpretation of the connections between the seriousness of an incarcerated person’s crime and their recidivism risk after release often justifies policymakers’ endorsement of life imprisonment. Most people serving life, including for murder, will not forever present a risk to public safety. Even so-called “chronic-offenders,” people who have committed repeated crimes, gradually desist from criminal conduct so that their public safety risk is substantially reduced by their late 30s or 40s. Therefore, from a public safety perspective, life imprisonment is an unwise investment.States with the largest effects are in the South and West of the country, though the growth in life sentences in all states has been dramatic over these decades.Figure 2 provides a view of the states ranked by the percent difference between the current number of life-sentenced prisoners and the total prison population in 1970. Nevada and Utah are at the top of the table because these states’ current life-sentenced populations are more than four times each states’s entire prison population in 1970. The next two most dramatic shifts are in Louisiana and Alaska2)Life with or without parole is not statutorily defined in Alaska’s criminal code, but the state allows sentences we identify as “virtual life”terms of 50 years or more. where their life-sentenced populations are more than double their overall prison populations in 1970.Figure 2. Percent Difference Between Life-Sentenced Population in 2016 and Total Prison Population in 1970States farther down the table, such as Ohio, show that there are 70% as many life-sentenced prisoners today as the entire prison population in 1970. And in Maine at the bottom, the growth in life-sentenced prisoners is still notable: the number of lifers today reflects 26% of the total prison population from 1970.Figure 3. Population Change in Prison Population and Life-Sentenced Population, 2003-2016The Sentencing Project has collected information from state departments of corrections regarding the number of people serving life sentences at four distinct points in time: 2003, 2009, 2012, and 2016. This allows us to observe trends in life imprisonment. We find that while prison totals have declined by 0.5% between 2003 and 2016, there has been a 30% increase in life sentences.A further troubling aspect within this rise is that the most severe of the three categories of life sentences— life without the possibility of parole, or LWOP—has risen the fastest. As illustrated in Figure 4, we find a 59% rise in these sentences between 2003 and 2016 compared with an 18% increase in life with the possibility of parole.Reasons for the continued growth in life sentences despite reversals in crime and incarceration more generally point to various “tough on crime” policies that hold people in prison longer on their life sentences.Figure 4. Life without Parole Growing More Quickly Than Life with Parole, 2003-2016These include habitual offender laws, mandatory minimums, elimination of parole, and the transfer of juveniles to the adult system. These policies were advanced by legislators in the 1990s, and contributed to the sharp increase in life sentences, but have since come under greater scrutiny.As states rethink their regimes on punishment so that public safety is paired with fairness, it is clearly important to adopt reforms for those individuals convicted of low-level and nonviolent crimes. But it would also be wise from a moral and fiscal standpoint, as well as the standpoint of public safety, to give a second look to those serving life sentences as well.Prison Population in 1970 to Life Sentenced-Population in 2016, All StatesStatePrison Population 1970Life-Sentenced Population 2016RatioAlabama3,7906,1041.6Alaska1914002.1Arizona1,4612,3091.6Arkansas1,6582,4211.5California25,03340,6911.6Colorado2,0663,5831.7Connecticut1,5687400.5Delaware5967911.3Federal20,0386,7200.3Florida9,18714,1661.5Georgia5,1139,3771.8Hawaii2283601.6Idaho4116491.6Illinois6,3815,0920.8Indiana4,1373,7670.9Iowa1,7471,1690.7Kansas1,9021,3770.7Kentucky2,8491,5090.5Louisiana4,19611,2832.7Maine5161360.3Maryland5,1864,1580.8Massachusetts2,0532,0381.0Michigan9,0795,7110.6Minnesota1,5855970.4Mississippi1,7302,4131.4Missouri3,4133,4361.0Montana2603701.4Nebraska1,0017690.8Nevada6903,2374.7New Hampshire2442661.1New Jersey5,7042,0800.4New Mexico7421,0511.4New York12,0599,8890.8North Carolina5,9694,1320.7North Dakota147800.5Ohio9,1856,6850.7Oklahoma3,6403,5901.0Oregon1,8007370.4Pennsylvania6,2897,8001.2Rhode Island3782740.7South Carolina2,7262,5400.9South Dakota3913710.9Tennessee3,2683,5631.1Texas14,33117,7551.2Utah4912,0044.1Vermont1621210.7Virginia4,6482,5770.6Washington2,8642,9531.0West Virginia9387480.8Wisconsin2,9731,4130.5Wyoming2313111.3Total197,245206,268Footnotes[+] Footnotes↑1 Prison population data was not available for Alaska, Arkansas, and Rhode Island in 1970, so for these states we use prison populationdata for 1971.↑2 Life with or without parole is not statutorily defined in Alaska’s criminal code, but the state allows sentences we identify as “virtual life”terms of 50 years or more.Download PDFSentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesRelated PostspublicationsOctober 25, 2022Locked Out 2022: Estimates of People Denied Voting RightsChristopher Uggen, Ryan Larson, Sarah Shannon, and Robert StewartAn estimated 4.6 million Americans are barred from voting due to a felony conviction.Download PDFRead OnlinenewsOctober 03, 2022October is Youth Justice Action Month!October is Youth Justice Action Month! Our network of allied advocates and supporters use this month to celebrate the actions we’ve taken in the movement to end youth incarceration and provide all youth with the support they need to thrive.Youth JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up500%Increase in U.S. jail & prison population in the last 40 yearsMore FactsTake ActionActions related toSentencing PolicyAsk Congress to support the Second Look ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
