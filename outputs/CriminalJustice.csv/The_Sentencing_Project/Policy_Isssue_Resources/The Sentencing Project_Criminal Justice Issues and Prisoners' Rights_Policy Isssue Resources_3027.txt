Incarceration has moved from the option of last resort for the most recalcitrant individuals to the predominant public policy model of addressing crime. Consequently, the prison population has expanded exponentially.In 1970, 96 out of 100,000 Americans were detained in prisons (not including local jails), or 1 in 1,042. By the middle of 2008, that figure had increased by more than 400% to 509 per 100,000, or 1 in 196.
