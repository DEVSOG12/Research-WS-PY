Since rural communities had witnessed a series of failed redevelopment plans, prisons appeared to offer a politically expedient way in which to address the persistent poverty and population out-migration that had plagued them for decades.In order to attract this construction, local officials have often made generous offers in order to portray their site as an ideal choice. In a prison siting experience in Texas, for example, the town of Abilene offered an incentive package of over $4 million to the state. The package included a 316-acre site for the prison, as well as over 1,100 acres of farmland adjacent to the facility, capable of generating $500,000 in cotton per year. Town officials also proposed to build roads into the facility and to provide housing for administrators and corrections officers. Use of a private plane and hangar for state officials, computers, and upgrades to the communications and public works infrastructure were also promised.Calvin Beale, a demographer at the United States Department of Agriculture, has comprehensively documented the rise in rural prison siting. Since 1980, approximately 350 rural counties have sited prisons. From 1980 to 1991, 213 adult facilities were opened in rural areas, housing more than half of all prisoners residing in newly constructed institutions. This is in contrast to the 38 percent of inmates from older facilities located in nonmetro areas, which represent less than one-quarter of the total United States population. From 1992 to 1994, another 83 prisons were opened in nonmetro counties, constituting sixty percent of new prison construction.Despite the popularity of prison hosting, little empirical analysis has been undertaken to test the validity of using a prison as a tool for economic recovery. Instead, much of the literature has focused upon theoretical modeling of the expected impact of prison siting on such indicators as employment, property values and public safety. The handful of empirical pieces that have been conducted concerning prison siting and economic development have taken a very narrow approach. Those that have directly addressed work creation have simply measured the total expected number of positions, while ignoring how those positions are actually filled.In order to assess the degree to which prisons aid local economies, this study examines 25 years of economic data for rural counties in New York, covering both counties in which prisons were built and those without any facilities.To read the report, download the PDF below.Download PDFIncarcerationRelated PostspublicationsMay 27, 2021Letter in Support of the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and First Step Implementation ActAmy FettigIn a letter of support submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, The Sentencing Project's Executive Director Amy Fettig expressed the importance of advancing the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act (S.312) and the First Step Implementation Act (S.1014).Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesDrug PolicypublicationsFebruary 17, 2021No End In Sight: America's Enduring Reliance on Life ImprisonmentAshley NellisIn the United States, more than 200,000 people are serving life sentences – one out of every seven in prison.Download PDFRead OnlineCOVID-19Sentencing PolicyIncarcerationLife SentencesRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeGet Our Email UpdatesSign Up1 in 6Latinx men born in 2001 can expect to go to prison in their lifetimeMore FactsTake ActionActions related toIncarcerationSupport the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act and the First Step Implementation ActTake Action Now1705 DeSales St, NW8th FloorWashington, D.C. 20036202.628.0871(fax) 202.628.1091staff@sentencingproject.orgOur IssuesSentencing PolicyIncarcerationDrug PolicyRacial JusticeYouth JusticeGender JusticeVoting RightsCollateral ConsequencesThe FactsCriminal Justice FactsState-by-State DataTake ActionOverviewDonateWays to GiveAbout UsOverviewEventsStaff & BoardEmployment & InternshipsAnnual Reports & FinancesContact UsQuick LinksAll NewsAll PublicationsContact UsDonateThe Sentencing Project (EIN 52-1472546) is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.Copyright © 2022  The Sentencing Project All Rights Reserved Terms of Use  //  Privacy Policy
