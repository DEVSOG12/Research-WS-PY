The prison at Guantanamo Bay costs approximately than $13 million per prisoner per year to operate, and is both immoral and counterproductive to our national interests. Former President Bush and former President Obama both agreed that the prison at Guantanamo should be closed. Today, though, it remains open, and the prisoners there are increasingly losing hope of ever leaving.President Biden has committed to closing Guantanamo and ending the indefinite detention of the people held there. We have a real chance to finally move forward from this unfortunate chapter of U.S. history - but to do that we must hold President Biden to his word.You can help.
