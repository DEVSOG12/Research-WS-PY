Richard Durbin held a hearing about the possibility of closing Guantanamo. To express the religious community’s serious concerns about the dire situation at Guantanamo, NRCAT asked its supporters to engage in a “Fast to Close Guantanamo” leading up to the hearing. Almost 200 clergy and people of faith from across the country joined in the fast. See photos from some of the fasters on this Facebook page. For more information about the fast, view this story by Religion & Ethics Newsweekly.Congressional briefingOn May 10, 2013, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture cosponsored a Congressional briefing on why it is imperative that we close Guantanamo. NRCAT founder, Dr. George Hunsinger, eloquently spoke about the unfolding human crisis at Guantanamo. “The consequences of ignoring Guantanamo,” he said, “its abuses, and its hunger-striking detainees are enormous --not only for America, but for the prisoners themselves, many of whom have reached the point that they would prefer to die rather than persist in more years of indefinite detention, which is itself tantamount to torture.”  You can watch the video of the briefing here, with Dr. Hunsinger’s presentation starting at 36:10.HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
