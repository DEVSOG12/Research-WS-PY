A nationally recognized interfaith membership organization based in Washington, DC, NRCAT is comprised of more than 300 religious organizations and more than 75,000 individuals have participated in our programs and activities. Our diverse partners share a common commitment to advancing the values of human dignity, human rights and an end to torture, without exception. To achieve its mission, NRCAT engages in grassroots organizing, public education, and state and national policy advocacy.NRCAT began as a response amongst 150 faith leaders convened by Dr. George Hunsinger, professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, seeking a moral response to harrowing reports of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. From this hunger for a collective moral voice to end U.S.-sponsored torture, NRCAT was founded in 2006.Today, NRCAT's national membership includes representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha'i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and religious groups, regional interfaith and ecumenical organizations, and local congregations.IN THIS SECTIONWho We AreStaffBoard of DirectorsNRCAT Press ReleasesContact UsHomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
