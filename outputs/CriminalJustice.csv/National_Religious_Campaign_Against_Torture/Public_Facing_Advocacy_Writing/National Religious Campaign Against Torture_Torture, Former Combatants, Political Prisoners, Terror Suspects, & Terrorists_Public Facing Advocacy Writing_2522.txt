The NDAA included a provision authored by Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein that makes permanent the ban on CIA torture.Rev. Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released this statement:"This is a huge victory for people of faith who worked and prayed for an end to torture. We can give thanks today, having taken an important step in defending American values and beginning to restore our country's role as a moral leader in the world."The McCain-Feinstein provision requires that the CIA use only ethical, legal interrogation techniques and ensures that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to all detainees. These are common sense ideas and our leaders were right to write them into law."Matt Hawthorne, Policy Director for the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, added:"This is only the latest in a series of instances where Republicans and Democrats have come together in opposition to torture. From the bi-partisan votes to adopt and release the Torture Report to the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to adopt the McCain-Feinstein amendment, it's clear that both parties agree - torture was a mistake that should never be repeated."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
