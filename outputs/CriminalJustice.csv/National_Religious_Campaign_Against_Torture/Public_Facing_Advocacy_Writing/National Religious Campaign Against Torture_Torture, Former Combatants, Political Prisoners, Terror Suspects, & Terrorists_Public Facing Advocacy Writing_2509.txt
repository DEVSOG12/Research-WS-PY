Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, condemned Senator Richard Burr's effort to bury the truth about torture by having the Trump Administration return its copies of the full Senate Torture Report:“The truth is that torture is not only immoral, it's also illegal and ineffective. Instead of learning from the past, the Trump Administration has decided to comply with Senator Richard Burr's effort to bury that truth by returning copies of the full Senate Torture Report to the Senator. We hope both Senator Burr and the Trump Administration reconsider this poor decision, and ask themselves, what do they have to fear from reading the Torture Report? What do they have to fear from the truth?"The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
