Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released the following statement:“If President Trump wants to be tough on terrorists, he should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and deprive them of an important recruiting tool. It is a moral outrage that the U.S. continues to spend more than $10 million per detainee each year to keep open a prison that is an international symbol of U.S. torture. Calling for indefinite detention without trial is one of the most un-American things I’ve ever heard in a State of the Union address.”The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
