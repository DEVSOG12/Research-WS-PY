Since it appears unlikely that Congress will over-ride the veto, the President and Congress are expected to now negotiate a new version of the NDAA. Rev. Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture released this statement addressing two parts of the NDAA:"When they voted to pass the NDAA, a bipartisan majority of Congress voted to put a permanent end to CIA torture. The McCain-Feinstein provision requires that the CIA use only ethical, legal interrogation techniques and ensures that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to all detainees. This is consistent with American values, and it is something that Congress and the President should retain in the final NDAA. Torture is always wrong.However, the vetoed version of the NDAA also includes provisions that would unreasonably restrict the Administration from transferring even cleared detainees out of Guantanamo. Guantanamo is both a symbolic reminder of our country's use of torture and a place where most detainees are still held without a trial. The time to close Guantanamo is now, and Congress and the President should agree on new language that will make this important goal possible."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.NRCAT.org    @NRCATtweets   facebook.com/nrcat ###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
