Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT), released the following statement:“We do not know if Donald Rumsfeld is guilty of ordering the torture of two U.S. citizens who were contractors in Iraq; that is for the courts to decide.  But the decision by a federal appeals court to allow a lawsuit against the former Secretary of Defense now permits the courts to determine if he ordered – or was responsible for authorizing – the torture of these two contractors.  No one should be above the law, and no one should be protected from a lawsuit just because he once held a high position in the government.The decision to let the lawsuit proceed comes after a consistent refusalby the U.S. government to thoroughly investigate other instances oftorture (involving waterboarding, induced hypothermia, prolongedisolation, beatings and other abuses).The National Religious Campaign Against Torture calls on President Obamato establish an independent, non-partisan Commission of Inquiry tofully investigate all instances of U.S.-sponsored torture and to makerecommendations for ensuring that our country never uses torture again.All people are endowed by their Creator with a basic human dignity thatshould never be violated by acts of torture.  A great country, like theUnited States, should not be afraid to confront and learn from itspast.  Torture is wrong, and until our country is willing to learn fromits past, we risk engaging in torture again.”///HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
