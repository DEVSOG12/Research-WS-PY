Richard L.Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture,issued the following statement:"We already know that the CIA destroyed 92 video tapes of theinterrogation of detainees many of which show them being tortured.  Now, we learn that the CIA has hidden theexistence of three other tapes for three years - failing even to disclose thefact of their existence to a federal judge.We don't know what is on these new tapes, but their very existence (andthe fact that it took so many years for their existence to be made known) isanother demonstration of the  compelling needfor a Commission of Inquiry to investigate our past use of torture and todetermine what safeguards are needed to prevent its future use.  Only a thorough investigation will be able toshine a light on all of the unanswered questions."# # #The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a growing membership organization committed to endingU.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
