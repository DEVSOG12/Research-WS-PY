Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, released this statement:"In his second full day in office, President Obama made a promise to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  It’s good to hear Attorney General Holder reiterate that vow.  As a site where torture is known to have occurred, Guantanamo remains a symbol of America’s use of torture, and the fact that it is still open raises concerns about the strength of our country’s commitment to never again use torture.  People of faith from around the nation have called on President Obama to act more aggressively to close Guantanamo, and we will continue to do so until our nation lives up to its moral obligations and closes this terrible chapter of American history forever."While we appreciate the Administration’s renewed attention to thisissue, we cannot help but note that in the past, the President hassigned legislation that placed restrictions on his ability to closeGuantanamo, which resulted in the prison remaining in operation almostthree years after President Obama took office.  As the Attorney Generalnoted, ‘Some people [in Congress] have made this a political issue.’  IfPresident Obama is to fulfill his promise to close the prison atGuantanamo Bay, he will have to take a brave stand against those thatuse the issue for political gain, and he will need to veto legislationthat would otherwise prevent him from closing Guantanamo."///For more, see a story from the Associate Press.HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
