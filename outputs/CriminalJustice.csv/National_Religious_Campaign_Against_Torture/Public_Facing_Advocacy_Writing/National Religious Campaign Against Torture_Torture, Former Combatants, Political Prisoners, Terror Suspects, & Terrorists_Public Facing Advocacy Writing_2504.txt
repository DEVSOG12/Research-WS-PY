Gina Haspel supervised waterboarding and other torture at the CIA black site in Thailand. She was also wrote the memo ordering the destruction of the videotaped evidence of torture before Members of Congress were able to review the tapes, and, when asked by four different Senators during her confirmation hearing, she consistently refused to say that torture is immoral.Rev. Ron Stief, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, said this about vote:"In a new low, the U.S. Senate today confirmed a known torturer to a Cabinet-level position in the U.S. government. While Ms. Haspel was forced to say that she would never restart the CIA's torture program, she nevertheless refused repeated requests to say that torture is immoral. This is a good day for tyrants, dictators, and others who abuse human rights. This is a bad day for anyone who cares about reining in this President, and others in his Administration, who have no moral hesitation around torturing another human being."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 300 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities.
