Today, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture honored the courage of the plaintiffs in this case and applauded Governor Cuomo and the New York Department of Corrections for this important step forward. While communities of faith celebrate the advances promised in this settlement, NRCAT also reaffirmed its commitment today to passing the Humane Alternatives to Long-term Solitary Confinement Act (A. 4401/S.2659), legislation that will end the torture of prolonged isolation in New York State.Following the announcement of this settlement, Rev. Ron Stief, executive director of NRCAT released this statement:"The settlement in Peoples vs. Fischer provides much-needed changes to begin to rectify the unjust solitary confinement practices in New York State. Long-term solitary confinement – condemned as torture by the Pope and the United Nations alike – does profound harm to those who are incarcerated, their loved ones, and to corrections staff working in such toxic environments. As people of faith we cannot abide the callous disregard for the humanity of so many in our prisons and jails. This settlement is an important recognition of our nation's moral duty to move from a punishment system to one that prioritizes restoration, rehabilitation and recovery.We are mindful that full relief for the four thousand people who remain in solitary confinement in New York state prisons is not yet attained. Our interfaith membership stands united in calling on New York legislators to pass the Humane Alternatives to Long Term Solitary Confinement Act, landmark legislation which would end long term solitary confinement beyond 15 days in New York state. This week's settlement paves the way for the critical changes this legislation will bring about, but we cannot afford to delay any longer."The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
