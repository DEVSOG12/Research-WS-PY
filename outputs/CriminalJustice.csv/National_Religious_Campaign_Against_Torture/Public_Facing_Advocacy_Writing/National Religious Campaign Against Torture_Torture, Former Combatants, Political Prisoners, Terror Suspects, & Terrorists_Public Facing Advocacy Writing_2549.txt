The United Nations, in 1997, decided to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the date (June 26, 1987) that the Convention Against Torture came into force by declaring June 26 as International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. Torture Awareness Month honors that day and extends the awareness campaign throughout the month of June.The National Religious Campaign Against Torture has released a free online toolkit to help congregations and religious organizations to observe Torture Awareness Month this year. The interfaith organization also will co-sponsor several public events across the country in June.NRCAT’s Torture Awareness Month toolkit includes two bulletin inserts (one focused on post-9/11 detainee treatment and one focused on solitary confinement in U.S. prisons), interfaith prayers, a downloadable poster for posting in houses of worship and college campuses, and links to other activities that congregations can conduct and lead throughout June.Through the toolkit, NRCAT is urging congregations and religious institutions to focus on two important efforts:Informing people of faith about the excellent and comprehensive report of the Task Force on Detainee Treatment of The Constitution Project, a high level bi-partisan panel on U.S.-sponsored torture. NRCAT is also encouraging people to ask the Senate Intelligence Committee to release its 6,000 page report on U.S.-sponsored torture of post-9/11 detainees.Encouraging people of faith to learn the facts about prolonged solitary confinement in the context of mass incarceration in U.S. prisons and to participate in NRCAT’s efforts to end torture in U.S. prisons.“The Constitution Project report provided an effective, comprehensive view of U.S.-sponsored torture, and there is now growing momentum in many states across the country to limit profoundly the use of prolonged solitary confinement,” said Rev. Richard Killmer, Executive Director of the National Religious Campaign Againt Torture. “It is not often that people of faith working to end torture have good news to report, but we now have two excellent opportunities to make progress to end torture.”NRCAT’s theme for Torture Awareness Month 2013 is “Healing a Culture of Torture,” reflecting the need to reflect, pray, and act on the deep physical and spiritual harm caused by torture. “Healing a culture of torture requires people of faith to truly embody our common belief in the inherent dignity of each human being by ensuring that torture never happens again,” said Rev. Killmer.In 1988, President Reagan signed the UN Convention Against Torture, which includes the commitment that, “No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, international political instability or any other public emergency may be invoked as justification for torture.” The U.S. Senate ratified the Convention in 1994.NRCAT’s website, www.nrcat.org/june2013, contains suggestions and materials to mark the month.The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT) is a membership organization committed to ending U.S.-sponsored torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Since its formation in January 2006, more than 320 religious organizations have joined NRCAT, including representatives from the Catholic, evangelical Christian, mainline Protestant, Unitarian Universalist, Quaker, Orthodox Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baha’i, Buddhist, and Sikh communities. Members include national denominations and faith groups, regional organizations and local congregations.www.nrcat.org###HomeDonateStatement of ConscienceAbout UsOrganizations JoinContact UsNational Religious Campaign Against TorturePO Box 91820 Washington, DC 20090 (t) 202.547.1920 (f) 202.547.1921
