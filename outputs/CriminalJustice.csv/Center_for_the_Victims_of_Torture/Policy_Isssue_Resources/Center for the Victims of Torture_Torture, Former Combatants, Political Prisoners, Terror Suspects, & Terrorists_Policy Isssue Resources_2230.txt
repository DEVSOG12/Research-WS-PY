  UPDATING THE ESTIMATE OF REFUGEES RESETTLED IN THE UNITED STATES  
WHO HAVE SUFFERED TORTURE  
Craig Higson -Smith1 
Center for Victims of Torture  
Torture is a strong predictor of a broad range of debilitating and lasting physical  and mental health 
conditions (Quiroga & Jaranson, 2005) . Populations of re fugees who are being resettled in the United 
States include  many torture survivors, many of whom r equire significant  and specialized health and 
mental health care.  For example, refugees who report experiences of torture are four times  more  likely 
to suffer  from post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than other refugees, and 2.5 times more likely to 
suffer from depression (Steel et al., 2009) . For these reasons, it is essential that policy  makers in the field 
of refugee health services hav e a reliable estimate of the number of torture surviving refugees in the 
country.  
Until recently , policy  makers have been forced to rely on an outdated estimate of between 400,000 and 
500,000 torture surviving refugees in the United States. This number was derived in the early 1990s 
from the oft-cited torture prevalence rate of 5 -35% found extensively in the literature on torture . This 
range is in fact based on studies conducted in several different high income countries in which refugees 
were being resettl ed; it is not known how accurately those studies reflect the situation in the United 
States. The estimate appears in a chapter in a volume intended to provide a critical account of current 
refugee policie s in European countries (Baker , 1992).  
Given that th is number has not been updated in more than twenty years, and that significant numbers 
of refugees have been resettled in the United States every year during that period, the estimate of 
400,000 to 500,000 torture surviving refugees in the United States is  certainly incorrect. The actual 
number must be much greater than that. How much greater is the key question to which policy -makers 
require an answer.  
Unfortunately, measuring the prevalence of something as sensitive and complex as experiences of 
torture i n populations as diverse as refugees in the United States is an extremely challenging task. Were 
it easier, there is no doubt that the estimate would have been updated regularly.  Nevertheless, given 
the importance of this question for  policy on refugee res ettlement and the provision of health and other 
services , the Center for Victims of Torture  (CVT) found it essential  to see what could be done to update 
the understanding of the size of the population of torture surviving refugees in the United States.  To do 
this, CVT’s researchers developed the following meta -analytic methodology and arrived at the results 
and conclusions laid out towards the end of this summary paper.

METHODOLOGY  
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews & Meta -Analyses (PRISM A) guidelines (Liberti, 
2009) were followed for the systematic literature review and meta -analysis carried out herein. A 
comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing four online library search databases (Embase, 
Ovid Medline, PILOTS/WOS, and Psy chInfo), with assistance from a Diehl Hall Bio -Med Librarian on the 
University of Minnesota Health Sciences campus. ‘Exploded’ MeSH headings were additionally utilized 
for a wider range of nested terms so that the resulting list of citations would include most or all major 
epidemiologic study designs. “Torture ,”“survivor ,” “refugee and/or asylum -seeker” and “prevalence” 
were the four main categories of terms used.

As intended to ensure comprehensiveness , this initial search produced a very long list of potentiall y 
relevant references. These references were then reviewed at two levels (abstract review and full text 
review) with respect to the following inclusion criteria:  
1. The published article had bee n through a peer -review process.  
2. The results of the study were pu blished in the years 1980 to 2015 . 
3. The results included a  quantitative  estimate of the prevalence of torture within an adult  
population  (defined as eighteen years or older) of asylum seekers, asylees, or refugees currently 
within the United States. Althoug h some included studies differentiated between primary and 
secondary torture survivors, this was not an inclusion criterion.

  4. The study reported on a representative sample of the general population, as opposed to 
convenience or help -seeking samples.  
The pro cess by which the initial search  results  were narrowed down to the final set of five studies is 
summarized in Figure 1.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following this initial search , CVT released preliminary findings to the member  center s of the National 
Consortium of Tor ture Treatment Programs (NCTTP)  of the United States. Currently the consortium has 
34 members in 17 states. Consortium members were asked to identify any other studies that might have 
been missed in CVT’s initial search. Although several members of the con sortium responded positively 
to this initiative, emphasizing the importance of more accurately estimating the number of torture 
surviving refugees in the United States, no further studies or publications were identified. 
Representatives of one center raise d concerns about the findings of one study included in the meta -
analysis – further details are included below.

  Keller et al. (2003), associated with the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture , conducted 
interviews wi th 70 asylum seekers who were being detained in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
The people interviewed were mostly men and from various countries on the African continent. 74% 
reported experiences of torture.  
Jaranson et al. (2004) , associated with the University of Minnesota  and the Center for Victims of Torture  
(CVT) , interviewed 1,134 Oromo and Somali refugees living in the Minneapolis/St . Paul area. 55% of 
Oromo respondents and 36% of Somali respondents reported experiences of torture. Overall, 4 4% of 
the sample reported being tortured.  
Marshall  et al. (2005), a ssociated with the Program for Torture Victims, Los Angeles , conducted a 
household survey and interviewed 490 refugees from Cambodia who were living in California at the time 
of the study. 24% of those interviewed reported being p rimary victims  of torture , and a further 31% 
were secondary victims. In total, 54% of respondents had been exposed to torture.  In this study , torture 
was identified based on responses to item 16 of the Harvard Traum a Questionnaire – Part One ( Mollica 
et al., 1992) . A representative of the Program for Torture Victims , Los Angeles  raised concern that the 
actual torture prevalence of torture among refugees from Cambodia  may be  in fact much higher than 
the reported 54%. This position was later supported  by Dr . Megan Berthold, one of the authors of the 
original paper. Given that exclusion of this paper from the meta -analysis would in fact reduce the overall 
result (as opposed to increasing it , in line with the higher estim ate suggested), the author decided to 
retain the paper so as to arrive at  a more accurate estimate of the number of torture surviving refugees 
in the country.  
Willard et al. (2013), a ssociated with the Community Health Alliance , conducted retrospective ch art 
reviews of public health screenings of Iraqi refugees  arriving in Utah . Of 497 files reviewed, 24% 
reported being primary survivors of torture, and 31% reported being secondary survivors. In total, 56%  
of the samples reported exposure to t orture.  
Shannon et al . (2014), a ssociated with the University of Minnesota  and CVT, reviewed the charts 
following public health screening  of 179 Karen refugees from Burma and Thailand, now living in 
Minneapolis and St . Paul , Minnesota . Of these , 27% reported bein g primary survivors of torture and 51% 
reported being secondary survivors.  
Meta -Analysis  
The simple meta -analysis was conducted using MetaXL Version 2.2. In essence , this analysis provides a 
weighted average of a number of study results. Prevalence rates f or primary victim s of torture were 
used in the analysis, although some studies also estimated the prevalence of secondary victims. The 
author used a random effects model which assumes that variability in effects arise from two sources : 
sampling error and s tudy level differences. In other words, this analysis acknowledges that prevalence

  rates will differ depending upon refugees’ country of origin, the period when they entered the United 
States, and the methodology employed to estimate the prevalence of tort ure.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The analysis suggests an overall population prevalence of 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.3 -0.58). Since 
recent estimates suggest that there are three million refugees, asyl ees and asylum seekers in the United 
States  (Bureau o f Population, Refugees and Migration, 2015) , this analysis suggests that there may  be as 
many as 1.3 million torture surviving refugees in the country. This number is more than three times 
higher than the statistic often referred to in policy documents.  
Meta-analyses are entirely dependent upon the methodologies and results of the studies included in the 
analysis. As a result , there are a number of qualifications that should be borne in mind when 
interpreting these results.  
Firstly, this analysis is based o n only five studies. Given the enormous variability in the histories and 
experiences of refugee populations from different parts of the world, this is a very small number indeed. 
Although CVT researchers have conducted an extensive and systematic search fo r relevant studies, it is 
possible that one or more studies have been missed , especially any studies not published in the peer -
reviewed, scientific literature. Certainly more studies would enhance the accuracy of this kind of 
analysis.  
Secondly, several studies included in this meta -analysis have relatively small sample sizes  for population 
level research. Such small sample sizes reduce the confidence in prevalence estimates within particular 
populations, and although sample size is accounted for in the me ta-analysis model, it is difficult  to make 
more accurate predictions based on a few small samples.  
Thirdly, an analysis of this kind attempts to provide a prevalence estimate across an extremely 
heterogeneous population of refugees, asylum seekers and asyl ees. The complexity of the population 
demands many more studies before researchers are able to narrow down the confidence intervals 
around any estimate of the prevalence of torture.  
Finally, because experiences of torture are so difficult to talk about, t he manner in which researchers  
assess a history of torture will greatly influence their results.  Studies included in this analysis used a 
variety of methods.  With more studies, it might be possible to ascertain the impact of different 
methodologies on prev alence estimates.  
CONCLUSIONS  
Given all these limitations on the data (and in fact in the field itself) , it is very difficult to arrive at a 
specific and defensible estimate of the number of torture surviving refugees in the United States. The

  result quote d in the results section above is merely the mid -point of a broad range within which the true 
prevalence rate very likely lies.  
However, it is clear that the actual number of tortured refugees is a great deal higher than the statistics 
currently in use amo ng policy makers. Even if we were to abandon the estimate of up to half a million —
which is clearly out of date —this research suggests that the prevalence rate is higher than the often 
quoted rate of between 5 and 35%. This is likely the result of the Unite d States ’ focus in the selection of 
people for resettlement within the country.  This pattern continues with current political debates on how 
many Syrian refugees should be accepted into the United States, and the suggestion that preference 
should be given to refugees with medical problems and/or a history of torture.  
The United States is a generous recipient of refugees from around the world. With this generosity comes 
an obligation to do what is possible to provide medical and mental health care to these h ighly 
traumatized populations.  A history of torture is highly predictive of severe and lasting physical  and 
mental health concerns. As such, the prevalence of torture in refugee populations is an essential 
parameter for the long -term planning and sustainab ility of services for the refugee population. CVT 
recommends that policy  makers and researchers develop methodologies to more accurately track the 
growing number of torture surviving refugees living in the United States.
