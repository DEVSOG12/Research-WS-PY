PAUL, Minn. & WASHINGTON — The Center for Victims of TortureTM (CVT) today stood firmly with survivors of torture and others seeking asylum in the United States in response to Attorney General Barr’s decision permitting indefinite detention at the U.S. southern border.“Yet another Attorney General under the Trump administration, this time Mr. Barr, has continued to bend immigration law to the administration’s will by certifying a Board of Immigration Appeals case to himself. In the decision issued Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr directs judges to keep asylum seekers in detention for the duration of their case by making them ineligible for release on bond.“This means that if asylum seekers at the border express fear of returning to their home country and pass screenings by asylum officers (a process called a credible fear interview), they can be detained indefinitely while their case is pending. As victims of the most outrageous actions by humanity, survivors of torture will be particularly affected by this decision. As CVT has reported, the detention experience and conditions are re-traumatizing, often triggering the disturbing memories and feelings related to torture. At CVT, we know all too well that detention has devastating effects on survivors of torture. CVT will work against this misguided decision through all means available.” — Andrea Cárcamo-Cavazos, CVT senior policy counsel-###-The Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit organization headquartered in St. Paul, MN, with offices in Atlanta, GA, and Washington, D.C.; and healing initiatives in Africa and the Middle East.
