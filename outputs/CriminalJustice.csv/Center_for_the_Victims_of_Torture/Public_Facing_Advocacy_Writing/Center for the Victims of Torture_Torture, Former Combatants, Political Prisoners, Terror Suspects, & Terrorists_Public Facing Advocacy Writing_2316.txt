He is accused of commanding al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan that committed war crimes against US and allied forces.Hadi, who says his real name is Nashwan al-Tamir, has a degenerative spinal condition, and is among the most physically disabled of the 39 detainees at the prison.According to CVT, he was diagnosed with spinal stenosis in September 2010. However, he did not receive surgical treatment until his condition became severe seven years later, when he "began to experience a significant loss of sensation in both of his feet and a loss of bladder control".He has since received four additional surgeries performed at Guantanamo by off-island specialists, but continues to suffer from the condition and may require additional surgery.Guantanamo Bay: 75 US lawmakers call on Biden to 'immediately close' prisonRead More »Hadi relies on a wheelchair and walker inside the prison. He also has a padded geriatric chair and a hospital bed for court, the latter of which is kept for when heavy painkillers cause him to fall asleep.The United States is required to provide adequate health care to detainees under the Geneva Conventions, but because the US law forbids their transfer to the country, the Pentagon brings in medical experts and equipment to Guantanamo for the prisoners.In 2019, a judge ruled against Hadi's case for improved medical care and oversight from a civilian doctor.Roehm said that Hadi's situation highlights the US government's problem with dealing with the medical conditions of aging and disabled detainees at the prison."[The Department of Defense] is either unwilling or unable, or both, to deal with these kinds of medical issues, which in some ways isn't surprising. The prison wasn't stood up to be a nursing home after two decades," Roehm told MEE."If the reports of what's happened here are accurate, it doesn't remotely satisfy the standard of care that all men are supposed to receive at Guantanamo."RecommendedGuantanamoGuantanamo: Detainees petition US to release artwork from prisonGuantanamoGuantanamo detainee used as 'prop' for torture training losing battle for medical careGuantanamoBiden appoints senior diplomat to oversee detainee transfers from GuantanamoRead moreGuantanamoUAE urged to free Russian ballet dancer transferred from GuantanamoGuantanamoJustice Department pressed to stop defending Guantanamo detentionGuantanamoGuantanamo Bay: US transfers Moroccan detainee back to Rabat after 19 years' jailTop Menu EnNewsOpinionVideoThe Big StoryDiscoverEnglishFrançaisTopCountriesAlgeriaBahrainEgyptFranceIndiaIranIraqIsraelJordanKuwaitLebanonLibyaMauritaniaMoroccoOmanPakistanPalestineQatarRussiaSaudi ArabiaSudanSyriaTunisiaTurkeyUKUnited Arab EmiratesUSYemenAboutAbout usPrivacyTerms and conditionsCareersContact usCopyright © 2014 - 2022. Middle East Eye.
