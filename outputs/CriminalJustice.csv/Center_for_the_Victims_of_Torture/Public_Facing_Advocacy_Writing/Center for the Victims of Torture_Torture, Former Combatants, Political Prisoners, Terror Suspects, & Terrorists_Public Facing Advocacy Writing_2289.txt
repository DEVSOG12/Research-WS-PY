PAUL, Minn. & WASHINGTON — The Center for Victims of TortureTM (CVT) today responded to the Trump administration’s announcement that they will cap the number of refugees to be resettled in the United States in Fiscal Year 2021 at a meager 15,000.“Setting the number of refugees to be allowed safe haven in the next year at only 15,000—which includes 6,000 spots that went unused in Fiscal Year 20—again illustrates the Trump administration’s cold and callous refusal to protect the lives of people who have been forced to flee their homes. Given the scale of the global refugee crisis, the United States should be welcoming on the order of 10 times as many refugees.“At CVT, we extend care to refugees in many of our locations, and we know what they have endured and what they face for the future. Many clients tell us that the possibility of a new beginning in a safer country is the ray of hope that drives them to strive for a better future for themselves and their families. And the complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have made it clear that now is the time to extend even more help and support to refugees and the many torture survivors among them.“This decision is not about U.S. national security or the economy, because we know that resettlement here benefits both. This is not what the American people want, nor what those fleeing persecution and danger must be afforded.”—Curt Goering, CVT executive director.-###-The Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit organization headquartered in St. Paul, MN, with offices in Atlanta, GA, and Washington, D.C.; and healing initiatives in Africa and the Middle East.
