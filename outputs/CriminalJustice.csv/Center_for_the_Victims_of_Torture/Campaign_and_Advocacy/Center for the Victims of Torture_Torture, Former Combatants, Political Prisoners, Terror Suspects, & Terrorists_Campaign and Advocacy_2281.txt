We trained over 100 Sierra Leonean paraprofessional mental health counselors, 57 of whom received a diploma or certificate in counseling from Milton Margai College of Education and Technology in Freetown.In 2005, CVT-trained paraprofessional mental health counselors formed CAPS, Community Association for Psychosocial Services. CAPS is an independent, nonprofit organization based in Kono. It is dedicated to continue providing for the mental health needs of their community, including survivors of torture and war trauma. A CVT organizational coordinator worked with CAPS throughout 2007 to help this new organization develop into a stable, sustainable community-based mental health service provider.In 2007, CVT launched a new initiative in Freetown, the capitol of Sierra Leone. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons project provided direct mental health care to survivors of severe trauma, including trafficking crimes, and continued to train Sierra Leonean paraprofessional mental health counselors. In addition, CVT provided training for government, health and NGO staff working with survivors of torture, war and trafficking to improve their ability to provide effective and sensitive care.CVT worked in Sierra Leone from 2001 until 2010. Our work was funded by the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and also made possible through the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development and the American people’s support.LinksUSAID: Trauma Counselling and Capacity Building in Sierra LeoneU.S. State Department 2012 Human Rights Report on Sierra LeoneU.S. State Department Background Note on Sierra LeoneMain menuWho We AreWhat We DoWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsCampaign to Ban TortureHealing in PartnershipGuineaThe Democratic Republic of CongoInternational Capacity Building ProjectLiberiaMinnesota Training ProjectsSierra LeoneTrauma Healing Initiative AfricaTrauma Healing Initiative - CambodiaWhat You Can DoResourcesNewsroomDonateDonate NowRead Ocen James's StoryRead Ocen James's StoryRead Other Survivor StoriesSubscribeSign up for updates and alertsEmail:ZIP/Postal Code:Spam Control Text:Connect with usHealingWe heal victims of torture through unique services and professional care worldwide.Read MoreTrainingWe strengthen partners who heal torture survivors and work to prevent torture.Read MoreAdvocacyWe advocate for the protection & care of torture survivors and an end to torture.Read MoreWho We AreHistoryFrequently Asked QuestionsBoard of DirectorsStaffNational Advisory CouncilGeorgia Advisory CouncilDiversity & InclusionFinancial InformationContact UsCVT BlogPrivacy PolicyWhat We DoHealingTrainingResearchAdvocacySurvivor StoriesCVT Staff StoriesWhere We WorkAfricaMiddle EastUnited StatesArizonaGeorgiaMinnesotaWorldwidePast ProjectsWhat You Can DoMake a GiftAdvocacyJoin an EventRequest a SpeakerVolunteerJob OpportunitiesRestoring Hope BreakfastResourcesFor Torture SurvivorsFor Health Care ProvidersFor Human Rights DefendersPublicationsNewsroomIn the NewsPress ReleasesNewslettersHealing & Human Rights BlogCalendarJune 26DonateThe Center for Victims of Torture877.265.8775 cvt [at] cvt.orgThe Center for Victims of Torture is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization (Tax ID number 36-3383933).HomeCareersYouTubeFacebookContact Us© The Center for Victims of Torture, 2022.
