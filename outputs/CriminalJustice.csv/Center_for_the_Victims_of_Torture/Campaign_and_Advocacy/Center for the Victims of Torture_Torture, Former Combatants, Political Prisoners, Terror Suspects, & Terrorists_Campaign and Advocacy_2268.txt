When officials prevented her from helping wounded members of the opposition, her convictions were tested and she felt compelled to leave her job. Days later, regime forces attacked her at home, dragging her into the street in her nightclothes.Manal was held for days in a makeshift prison. She heard others cry out while raped and tortured. Eventually, she was interrogated on why she helped the opposition. The interrogators told her that she had to choose the number of men who would rape her. One was not an option. Fortunately, Manal’s brothers paid a ransom before she was assaulted.Ultimately, Manal and her husband made their way to Amman, Jordan. There, she learned about CVT and received care from counselors and physiotherapists.Despite the difficulty in recounting it, Manal insisted on telling her story for Reclaiming Hope, Dignity and Respect: Syrian and Iraqi Torture Survivors in Jordan because she did not want her torturers to silence her. This report tells the stories of survivors who have made their way to Amman and outlines recommendations on processes, policies, transitional justice and accountability.As refugees, life still isn’t easy for Manal and her husband. But it’s changing. Manal refused to be silent and spoke out about her torture.  You can, too.
