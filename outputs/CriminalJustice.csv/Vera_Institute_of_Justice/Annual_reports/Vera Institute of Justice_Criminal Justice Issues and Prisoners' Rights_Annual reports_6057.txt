The department asked Vera to revise the selection process with the following primary objectives: 1) to develop a single, efficient selection process for temporary release and explore using objective point systems to guide or control the selection of inmates for temporary release; 2) to increase inmate understanding of and involvement in the selection process; and 3) to develop a management information system to monitor effectively the performance of the selection process criteria.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
