Security issues, however, continue to become more complex and challenging. Acting in a spirit of mutual cooperation to strengthen their efforts to safeguard children and enhance safety and security, the Chancellor, the Board of Education and the City entered into an agreement on September 17, 1998 to implement a joint program between the Board of Education and the New York City Police Department (NYPD). In accordance with this agreement, on December 20, 1998 school security functions performed by the Division of School Safety were transferred to the Police Department for an initial four year period, during which the Police Department is responsible for managing school security personnel.AuthorsNew York (City).
