Among men with disabilities, 13.9 percent reported experiencing sexual violence at some point in their lifetime, compared to 3.7 percent of men without disabilities. Women with disabilities were more likely than any group to report a completed or attempted rape, while men without disabilities were least likely to report an assault. While earlier studies have documented that women with disabilities are at increased risk for sexual violence when compared to women without disabilities, few have looked specifically at rates of victimization among men with disabilities. These findings begin to fill a critical gap in the knowledge of crimes against people with disabilities, but many unanswered questions remain. For example, this study did not include people with disabilities living in institutions, those with cognitive disabilities who would have required assistance completing the interview, and those who used communication devices other than a landline telephone—people who may be at even greater risk for sexual assault. Moreover, little is known about what contributes to differences in reporting among the groups and what happens when survivors with disabilities report sexual assault, as well as how often they reach out for services and what happens when they do. More research—and the funding to support it—is needed to provide policymakers and practitioners with information that can assist them in making sure those most at risk for sexual assault have access to the services and supports they need to heal.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
