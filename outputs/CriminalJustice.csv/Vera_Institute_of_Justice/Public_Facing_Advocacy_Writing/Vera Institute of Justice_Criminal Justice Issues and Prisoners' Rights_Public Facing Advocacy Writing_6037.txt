But not all jurisdictions are using detention and incarceration settings as proxy “asylums.” Some are finding creative ways to pay for research-tested community-based programs.The average cost of incarcerating one young person for a year (some estimates run as high as $150K) could save enough money to send 20 other youth to state-of-the-art mental health and substance abuse treatment programs in their communities. Some states – notably Illinois and New York – have done the math and funded an array of research-tested, community-based treatment alternatives. However, closing juvenile prisons and repurposing funds to keep kids at home and in treatment is not always politically popular. Gladys Carrion, New York State’s reform-minded commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services – the agency that oversees juvenile prisons – has faced fierce opposition for taking this policy position, although her efforts have picked up steam in the context of Governor Paterson’s Task Force on Transforming Juvenile Justice.There is no doubt that youth with serious mental health difficulties often penetrate deeper into the juvenile system than less impaired youngsters. But when reading Moore’s article it’s also important to note that researchers and policy makers (see Linda Teplin and Jeffrey Butts) have begun to reevaluate the scope of the problem and, by questioning how mental illness is defined, to challenge the accuracy of the often-quoted statistic Moore references: “…(66%) of the nation's juvenile inmates have at least one mental illness….” Labels like “conduct disorder” and “oppositional defiant disorder” – long-time staples of court-based psychiatry – might get a youth included in that 66 percent. But they tell us nothing more about a young person’s mental health other than perhaps that he or she is a normal adolescent in trouble with the law.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
