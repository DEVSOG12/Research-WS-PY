Over-incarceration—and its contribution to inequality—has been an obstacle in that battle. It has left too many with unrealized potential to become productive members of society who help strengthen the fabric of their communities.In the coming weeks, Vera will release a series of reports examining sentencing trends—where the states stand on mandatory minimums and other sentencing practices and the resulting collateral consequences. We will also be publishing a comprehensive study of the impact of the 2009 reforms to the Rockefeller drug laws in New York State, examining whether they have improved offender outcomes, reduced racial disparities, and saved money.Look also for updates from our Washington, DC, office about activities we are convening around the 20th anniversary of the 1994 Crime Bill—where we have been, where we are now, and where we should go in the future.Meantime, join the conversation on Twitter about the President’s speech and the potential for sentencing reform at #crimebillat20.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
