And, 90 percent believe that barriers to employment, school, and other opportunities should be removed for formerly incarcerated people.This breakthrough data indicates that Americans continue to reject calls for tough on crime policies—and that state and local momentum for reform remains strong.Read the full polling results.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
