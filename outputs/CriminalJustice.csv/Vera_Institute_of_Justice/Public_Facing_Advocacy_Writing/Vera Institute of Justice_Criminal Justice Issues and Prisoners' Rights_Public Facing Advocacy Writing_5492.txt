This project is a series of short videos with people who have survived or committed violence in order to elevate new and more complete stories about violence and its aftermath. These stories are to help people see things as they are and imagine what else is possible.We know that until new and more complete stories about violence and its aftermath are told, we will never be able to transform our responses to it or to keep people safe and well. With Ever After, we are telling those stories: stories of who have survived harm and people who have committed it; stories of violence, accountability, and healing; and stories that will help us see things as they are and imagine what else is possible.Social Justice groups across the nation in over 25 cities simultaneously hosted local screenings and facilitated conversations to connect the content to local issues, campaigns, and visions for addressing our responses to violence. You can view the digital stories below or at myeverafter.org and join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter.RelatedVIDEOSafeguarding JusticeApr 24, 2018VIDEOReimagine JusticeApr 21, 2017VIDEOReforming the Use of Solitary Confinement: A ConversationSep 26, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
