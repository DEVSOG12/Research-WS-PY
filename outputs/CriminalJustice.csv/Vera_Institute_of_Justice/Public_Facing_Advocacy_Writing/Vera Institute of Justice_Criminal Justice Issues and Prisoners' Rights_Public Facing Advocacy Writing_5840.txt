The program, which was designed by researchers at Georgetown University, develops the relationships between incarcerated teen fathers and their babies through intensive experiential learning. Participating fathers attend a parenting class, then visit with their children in a comfortable and relaxed environment. The program is a pilot run by the Ohio Department of Youth Services, which has worked with the Vera Institute’s Family Justice Program to implement research-based family engagement practices. The ABC News Channel 5 piece features the voices of incarcerated fathers as well as several mothers who have participated in the visits. To view the segment, click here.
