Others veer off toward hope and talk excitedly about all the lofty goals they’re going to accomplish in their first week home. One kid may need us to help him believe that with his family’s support he can make it through community supervision; another may need us to rein in the aspirations a bit so that disappointment isn’t imminent. In either case, our role is to inject elements of the opposite expectation: to help them strike the balance between reality and hope.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
