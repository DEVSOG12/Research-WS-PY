It is designed to elevate new and innovative research on policing practices and strategies by providing readers with succinct summaries that highlight key findings and implementation recommendations. This digest equips the field with practical, actionable resources, and provides guidance on policing best practices by disseminating evidence-informed approaches.The fourth volume—released today—focuses on the timely topics of officer well-being, de-escalation strategies, mental health crisis hot spots, the implementation of body-worn cameras, and the effects of community policing strategies on public perceptions of the police. It answers questions such as: What is the effect of shift-type and fatigue on officers’ ability to employ de-escalation strategies? How can officers best allocate resources to address mental health crisis hot spots? And, how do body-worn cameras affect police-civilian interaction outcomes? Research was conducted by leading scholars and research organizations, including but not limited to, Arizona State University, and George Mason University.In addition to making policing research more publicly accessible, the digest provides readers with information about current science to help examine emerging issues and how they might apply to one’s own police agency and community. We welcome input, questions, and suggestions – especially regarding research topics you’d like to see featured in future volumes—and look forward to your feedback and readership.Please forward any questions, suggestions, or subscription requests to EmergingIssuesPolicing@vera.org.RelatedPUBLICATIONEmerging Issues in American Policing DigestJun 01, 2018PUBLICATIONTo Protect and ServeApr 05, 2017NEWSStronger Together: Vera’s Policing Program Works to Bridge the Divide between Police and CommunityOct 16, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
