I’m never particularly comfortable seeing myself on film, but I was glad to be in such good company; one thing that’s notable about American Jail is that while we hear from a number of “experts,” Williams hands a good piece of the job of explaining the system to those who have been directly impacted by it, including people who are currently incarcerated.  These experts are rarely heard on CNN, or anywhere, and they are the voices that need most to be heard.One of the most resounding feelings I got while watching American Jail was that this system we have created (and permit to endure) is outrageous.For those of us who are lucky enough to be outside the grip of the criminal justice system as we work to change it, it’s possible to forget that how outrageous it really is. This program reminded me to hold on to my outrage – and use it to mobilize action.With that in mind, I am glad that American Jail is the sort of program that makes us outraged, even in a time in which  the news gives us reasons daily to feel overwhelmed.  I am glad, too, that many of those voices of critique and outrage come to the screen from inside America’s jails and prisons. We need to hear more from the people we too often forget about.RelatedPUBLICATIONThe New Dynamics of Mass IncarcerationJun 14, 2018NEWSThis Year’s Oscar Film Nominees Highlight the Shared History of Black American Life and Mass IncarcerationFeb 23, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
