But corrections staff are often unsure about how this idea could work within the culture of their organization.The Family Justice Program has enjoyed a long partnership with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. In a new five-minute video, you can see the various ways that staff in Oklahoma correctional facilities, probation, and parole are using the tools and methods of the Family Justice Program. The Family Justice Program tailors its work with each of our partners in corrections and juvenile justice. We’d love to hear about innovative ideas that involve families in your community.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
