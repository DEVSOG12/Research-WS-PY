In addition to his internship responsibilities, Hernan excels as a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and he was recently appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to the New York State Juvenile Justice Advisory Group.People at Vera often remark that Hernan has more energy than all of us combined. There seems to be nothing that he cannot achieve when he sets his mind to it. I am so very proud of him and was grateful for the opportunity to acknowledge the work he is doing to improve himself and the community.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
