But overall, 2018 was a year of deepening tensions. Immigrant families were separated at the border, even as jurisdictions around the country mounted public defense programs for people facing deportation. Some states reforming their justice systems added harsher penalties for opioid offenses. And, in the age of #MeToo, one sexual assault survivor reluctantly took the spotlight to challenge a Supreme Court nominee.Join Vera for a journey through the stories that shaped American justice in 2018.Immigration Under AttackFrom family separation to increased interior apprehensions, the administration doubles down on immigration enforcement.The Crisis ContinuesStates struggle to find ways to cope with—and prevent—an ever-increasing number of opioid overdoses.Innovative Strategies Gain GroundLaw enforcement agencies nationwide explore reforms to policing practices, but use-of-force incidents continue to make headlines.No Simple Solution to ReformStates take steps toward reforming—or even ending—money bail, but questions about the fairness of alternatives remain.A Focus on the Power of ProsecutorsAdvocates and the media shine a spotlight on the power of prosecutors and their role in mass incarceration—and what some are doing to reduce it.A Shifting LandscapeJail construction booms in rural areas, even as some larger cities push to downsize their jail populations and close aging facilities.Prevention and Rehabilitation in the SpotlightStates enact legislation aimed at keeping young people out of the adult criminal justice system.A Growing DivideWhile some states enact tougher sentences and mandatory minimums, others pass reforms and get “smart on crime.”Federal Prison Reform Becomes LawCongress passes the bipartisan FIRST STEP Act, the first major federal criminal justice reform legislation since 2010.A Bipartisan Emphasis on ReentryStates remove barriers to voting and occupational licenses for people with criminal records in a bipartisan effort to ease reentry.Victims’ Voices Are AmplifiedVictims of crime take control of their own narratives and try to drive changes in 2018.LensesThere are important issues that transcend many or all categories of justice reform.
