However, as the number of people on probation has grown massively and probation supervision has become more punitive over the past few decades, recent reports have focused on how probation is actually contributing to mass incarceration.But there is little information about probation’s impact on jail populations in particular. To remedy this, Vera obtained detailed data from nine cities and counties participating in the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation’s Safety and Justice Challenge (SJC), a national initiative that seeks to address over-incarceration by changing the way the United States thinks about and uses jails. This report explores how probation drives jail populations in racially disparate ways—through stringent and difficult to meet probation conditions that can result in revocation and through the detention of people awaiting violation hearings.AuthorsAlex RothSandhya KajeepetaAlex BoldinKey TakeawayProbation has been considered an alternative to incarceration, but it has become more common and more punitive over time. It is increasingly a driving force in mass incarceration. By sentencing fewer people to probation, limiting the length of probation terms, and preventing probation violations, jail populations overall can decrease.Publication HighlightsIncreasingly large numbers of people are having their probation supervision revoked and are then being sentenced to incarceration.Two SJC sites—St. Louis County, Missouri, and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania—reduced the number of people on probation in their jails by funding support services and providing for early termination.There are pronounced racial disparities in the population of people held in jail for probation violations, with Black and Native American people disproportionately incarcerated.Key FactsIn 2019,one in 73adults in the United States was on probation.Black people are4.3xmore likely to be admitted to prison for a probation revocation.In 2018, Black people were over2.6xmore likely than white people to be on probation.RelatedPUBLICATIONA Technical Guide to Jail Data AnalysisOct 08, 2021PUBLICATIONPeople in Jail and Prison in Spring 2021Jun 07, 2021SPECIAL REPORT (CHAPTERED)A Toolkit for Jail Decarceration in Your CommunityOct 12, 202134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
