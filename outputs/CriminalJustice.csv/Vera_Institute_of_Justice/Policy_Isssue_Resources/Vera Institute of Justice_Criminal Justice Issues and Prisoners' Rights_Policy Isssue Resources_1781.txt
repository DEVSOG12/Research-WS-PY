To explore public opinion on this issue, Vera is partnering with the survey firm Lucid to conduct public opinion polls about government-funded counsel in several communities across the United States. Although the research is ongoing, the findings thus far show widespread support for government-funded counsel in immigration court.This page will continue to be updated with the results from additional communities as the research is completed.RelatedPROJECTThe New York Immigrant Family Unity ProjectNov 06, 2013VIDEOEveryone Means EveryoneNov 11, 201934 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
