Wildcat was begun by Vera (as Pioneer Messenger Service) to enable ex-addicts—traditionally viewed as unemployable and a threat to society—to be a resource to society by developing work habits in a supported setting. ERIC abstract: Wildcat Service Corporation is a highly successful employment service for ex-drug addicts and alcoholics who have served prison terms, are on welfare, and have little work experience. Funded mainly by the Manpower Administration, Wildcats's 3,000 workers perform service operations for many of New York City's government departments and businesses.
