Most were victims of crime before they were incarcerated, and many experience victimization during their incarceration or once they return home. But regardless of when their victimization occurred, the vast majority of survivors who have previously been incarcerated do not get the services they need to heal. In this report, we shine a light on crime victims who have previously been incarcerated, examine their needs and barriers to services, and offer strategies for opening the door to healing for these survivors.RelatedPUBLICATIONSupervised Visitation and ExchangeAug 30, 2018PUBLICATIONA Blueprint for ChangeJun 19, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
