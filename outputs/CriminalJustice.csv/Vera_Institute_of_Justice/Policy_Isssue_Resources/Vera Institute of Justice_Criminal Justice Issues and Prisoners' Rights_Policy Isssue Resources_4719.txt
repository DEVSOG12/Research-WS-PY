In addition to addressing the conditions of confinement in segregation, the authors discuss the ground breaking efforts undertaken by Ohio and Mississippi in the mid 2000s to study and reduce their over-reliance on segregation. The article concludes with a description of Vera’s Segregation Reduction Project which works in partnership with states and local jurisdictions to reduce the use of segregation while ensuring institutional and public safety.AuthorsAngela BrowneAlissa CambierSuzanne Agha34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
