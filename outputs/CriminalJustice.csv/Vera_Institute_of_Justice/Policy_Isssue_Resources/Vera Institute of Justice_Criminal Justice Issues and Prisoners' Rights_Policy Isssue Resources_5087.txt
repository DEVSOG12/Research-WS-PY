The work of the Center resulted from joint efforts by the Institute for Mediation and Conflict Resolution (IMCR) and the Victim/Witness Assistance Project (V/WAP) of the Vera Institute of Justice. The report attempts to convey, in some detail, results of the first controlled research on mediation as an alternative to prosecution. The purpose is not only to evaluate the Brooklyn Dispute Resolution Center, but also, as enthusiasm for the mediation alternative gains momentum nationally, to inform the development of sound policy and effective programs.AuthorsRobert C.
