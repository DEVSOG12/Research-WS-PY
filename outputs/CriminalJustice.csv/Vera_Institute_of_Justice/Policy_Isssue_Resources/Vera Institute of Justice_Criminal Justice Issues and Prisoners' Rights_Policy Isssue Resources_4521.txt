This report dives into the data on black and white incarceration trends from 1990 to 2013, and poses several questions for further exploration that might explain why these rates are shifting. However, the report also argues that we need more data to fully understand the causes and consequences of racial disparities in incarceration—and to begin enacting more race-conscious jail reduction efforts.AuthorsRam SubramanianKristi RileyChris MaiKey TakeawayWhile black incarceration rates have declined—and white incarceration rates have risen—over the past several decades, the lack of complete and accurate data prevents effective analyses of the causes and drivers of these trends and on racial disparities more broadly in the justice system.Publication HighlightsThe vast majority of existing data on jail incarceration—from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Survey of Jails and its Census of Jails—is not sorted by race or ethnicity.BJS only reports the racial breakdown of the country’s jail population on a selected snapshot date, but not for jail admissions—which is the biggest measure of the vast reach of jails.Directly wrestling with the issue of race and incarceration remains uncomfortable ground because it forces people to confront a deep legacy of racism and its connection to our system of incarceration in this country, past and present.Key FactsBlack people are still3.6xmore likely to be incarcerated in local jails nationally than white people.Between 2005 and 2013, the black jail incarceration rate declined by20%nationally.Since 2005, black incarceration rates have dropped30%in urban areas and 22% in suburban areas.Since 2008, black incarceration rates have dropped14%in small/ medium metros and 2% in rural areas.Between 1990 and 2013, the white jail populationdoublednationally.Today, rural areas and small/medium metroshold more white people in jailthan the combined white populations of urban and suburban jails.RelatedPUBLICATIONOut of SightJun 12, 2017RESOURCE SITEIncarceration TrendsDec 16, 202134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
