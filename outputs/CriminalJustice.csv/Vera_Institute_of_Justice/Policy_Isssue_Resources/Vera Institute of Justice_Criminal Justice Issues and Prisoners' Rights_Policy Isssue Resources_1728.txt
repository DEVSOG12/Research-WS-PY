Incarceration is antithetical to any meaningful response to the overdose crisis—and may even exacerbate it. Substantial evidence shows that incarceration is associated with increased risk of overdose death due to a loss of tolerance to opioids, limited access to harm reduction and treatment services, and disruptions in health care and social support during and after periods of incarceration.Paul J.

Preliminary data also suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased overdose death among people who use drugs, as well as untold suffering and death among people detained in America’s jails and prisons, who are disproportionately Black or Latinx and low-income.F.B.

The data and resources provided in this special report are designed to help communities realize these goals. The data, case studies on New Mexico and North Carolina, and resources provided in this special report are designed to help communities realize these goals.AuthorsAndrew TaylorCharlotte MillerJason Tan de BibianaJackson BeckFrom 2014 to 2018More than 300,000 Peopledied of an overdose.In the same time period, overdose death rates for Black peopleincreased by 101%almost three times greater than the increase for white people.An estimated63% of peoplewho were sentenced to local jails from 2007 to 2009 met criteria for substance use disorder.Key takeawaysResources and responsibility for responding to drug use must be moved away from the criminal legal system and into non-punitive, health-oriented services located in, and led by, communities. Until then, local jurisdictions must take steps to minimize the harms of criminal legal system contact for people who use drugs.When counties spend money on jails, they have less money to spend on substance use treatment, harm reduction services, and other community-based resources that could prevent overdoses and improve community health and wellness.Incarceration can increase the risk of overdose for people returning to their communities.Improving access to substance use treatment and harm reduction supports in jails can address incarcerated people’s immediate needs, but cannot replace community-based responses.Explore Local DataTo understand trends in overdose death, jail incarceration, and racial disparities, the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) collected national and local data that can be explored using the tools below.
