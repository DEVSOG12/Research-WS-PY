In this publication, Vera researchers report on how the school implemented the project and the challenges it faced, which are common among schools that have implemented safety projects. The report discusses lessons that other schools should consider when they are planning safety programs, such as the necessity of developing strategies to recruit and retain project participants and the importance of linking safety problems to tested solutions.AuthorsMilton Mino34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
