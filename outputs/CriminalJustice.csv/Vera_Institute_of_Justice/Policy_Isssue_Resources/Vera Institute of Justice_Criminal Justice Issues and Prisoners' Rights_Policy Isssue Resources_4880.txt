This work emphasizes accountability as the most important tool for improving police services. Accountability helps to reduce crime, builds stronger relationships between law enforcement and the communities officers serve, and encourages collaboration between the many groups interested in public safety. While Vera’s policing projects span a broad range of issues and locations, they can be grouped into four categories: management practices, police-community relations, misconduct, and policing in democratic societies worldwide.AuthorsAaron Bloom34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
