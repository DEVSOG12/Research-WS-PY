It tests the relative explanatory power of neo-classical choice theory and labor market segmentation theory on the determinants of labor market outcomes, criminal behavior, and their interaction. The author concludes that the criminal choice decision is a highly complex and multiattributed one, and that the predictions of economic theory do not adequately capture the multiplicity of factors involved in crime.AuthorsRichard M.
