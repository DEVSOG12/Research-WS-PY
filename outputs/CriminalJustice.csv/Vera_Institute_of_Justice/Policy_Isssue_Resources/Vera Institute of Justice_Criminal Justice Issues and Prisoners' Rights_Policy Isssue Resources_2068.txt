State corrections budgets often fail to reflect certain costs— such as employee benefits, capital costs, in-prison education services, or hospital care for inmates—covered by other government agencies. In partnership with the Pew Center on the States, Vera developed a tool to calculate these costs and create a more holistic view of what taxpayers are paying to maintain these systems. While overlooked costs can vary from state to state, Vera’s survey of 40 states found that prison costs were in reality 13.9 percent higher than those states’ combined corrections budgets. This report explores those findings, and our calculation tool, while offering a breakdown of per-inmate costs in each state. It also offers recommendations for reducing these costs without jeopardizing public safety.AuthorsChristian HenrichsonRuth DelaneyPublication HighlightsState survey responses revealed considerable variation in prison costs that fall outside the corrections budget— from less than 1 percent (Arizona) to as much as 34 percent (Connecticut).The temptation to compare states’ per-inmate cost should be avoided, as lower expenses may lead to poorer outcomes in terms of safety and recidivism.Ways to lower spending without reducing public safety include: modifying sentencing and release policies, strengthening strategies to reduce recidivism, and boosting operating efficiency.Key FactsThe state prison population has grown700%nationwide since the 1970s.The average per-inmate cost was$31,286in Fiscal Year 2010.The 40 states surveyed by this study spent $39 billion on maintaining their prisons in 2010. That is$5.4 billionmore than their total reported corrections budgets for that year.In six of the 40 states surveyed, 20-34 percent of the total taxpayer cost of prison was outside the state corrections budget.RelatedPUBLICATIONThe Price of PrisonsMay 23, 2017PUBLICATIONThe Price of JailsMay 21, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
