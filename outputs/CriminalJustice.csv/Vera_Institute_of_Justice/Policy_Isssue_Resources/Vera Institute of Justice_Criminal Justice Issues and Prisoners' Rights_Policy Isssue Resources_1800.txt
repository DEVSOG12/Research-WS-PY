Ending mass incarceration and repairing its extensive collateral consequences thus must begin by focusing on the front end of the system: police work. Recognizing the roughly 18,000 police agencies around the country as gatekeepers of the system, this report explores the factors driving mass enforcement, particularly of low-level offenses; what police agencies could do instead with the right community investment, national and local leadership, and officer training, incentives, and support; and policies that could shift the policing paradigm away from the reflexive use of enforcement, which unnecessarily criminalizes people and leads directly to the jailhouse door.AuthorsRebecca NeusteterRam SubramanianJennifer TroneMawia KhogaliCindy ReedEditorial Strategy DirectorShow MoreKey TakeawayThere is a moral and strategic imperative to reshape police culture and incentives to ensure that the exercise of police discretion is more deliberate, transparent, and accountable and that policing practices are focused more tightly on dramatically reining in arrests, while promoting lesser forms of enforcement and holding officers and departments accountable.Publication HighlightsA punitive approach to law enforcement makes policing vastly more dangerous for both members of the public and officers, creates ripples of social and emotional harm that burden entire communities, and drives a wedge between officers and the people they are sworn to serve and protect.Mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, and poverty are frequently the subtexts of encounters with police—in which police are the default first responders to social issues that they are neither trained nor equipped to properly handleTo chart a new course in American policing, police should use arrest sparingly, intentionally, and transparently.Key FactsIf everyone with an arrest record in the US held hands, they would circle the globe3X.Researchers looking at arrest data for the years 1997 to 2008 found that 1/3 of young adults—and nearly1/2of all black men—had an arrest record by age 23.Young adults today are36%more likely to be arrested than were their parents at the same age.Nationally there are still roughly 28K arrests every day, which equates to one arrest every three seconds or approximately10.5Mevery year.In 2016, police arrested black people at more than2Xthe rate of white people.RelatedRESOURCE SITEArrest TrendsMay 26, 202134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
