Yet even as the number of people incarcerated in New York City has declined significantly in recent years, this decline has impacted almost exclusively men, and not women.This report, released by the New York Women’s Foundation in partnership with the Vera Institute of Justice, seeks to identify gender-informed strategies for getting New York City women disentangled from the criminal justice system. The policy and practical recommendations provided serve as a blueprint for ensuring that women are not overlooked in the fight to end mass incarceration in the city.Key TakeawayThis report is a blueprint of aspirational first principles, programmatic considerations, and practical solutions to keep women out of the criminal justice system and off Rikers Island.Publication HighlightsNationally, women are the fastest growing segment of the incarcerated population, in part because so little attention has been paid to the unique pathways that result in the arrest, prosecution, and—increasingly—the incarceration of women.Research on women in New York City’s criminal justice system suggests that they end up in custody for different reasons than men and boys, and traditional criminal justice options—such as existing diversion programs and alternatives to incarceration—are not tailored to meet their needs.This report offers recommendations for how New York City can embrace a different approach at three critical junctures in the criminal justice system: 1) at arrest; 2) at arraignment; and 3) when women are held at Rikers.Key FactsThe number of women incarcerated in the United States has ballooned700%since 1980.Every year, more than5,500 womenare admitted to the jail at Rikers Island.On any given day, there are approximately500 to 550women, mostly women of color, being held on Rikers Island.86%of incarcerated women nationally reported experiencing sexual violence and 77% experienced partner violence prior to their incarceration.More thanthree out of fourwomen admitted to Rikers during the study period were black or Latina.Based on self-reporting and clinical assessments, almostthree-quartersof women admitted to Rikers Island in the cohort analyzed had identified mental health needs.RelatedPUBLICATIONOverlooked: Women and Jails in an Era of ReformAug 15, 2016NEWSClosing RikersApr 03, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
