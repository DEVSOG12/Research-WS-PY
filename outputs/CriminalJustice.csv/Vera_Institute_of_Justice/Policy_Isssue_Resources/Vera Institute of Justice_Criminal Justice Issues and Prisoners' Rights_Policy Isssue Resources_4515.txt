In recent years, thenumber of older adults in U.S. prisons has soared, even as the overall prisonpopulation has declined. With them, the elderly bring increasingly demandinghealth and end-of-life care needs.However, prisons make insufficient use of these laws andpolicies. The result? Too many people end up dying in prison, at great humancost and great cost to taxpayers.In this report, Vera outlines a case study of medical parole inNew York State and makes practical recommendations that can guide New York—and otherstates across the country—in making full use of their compassionate releaselaws.AuthorsRebecca SilberLéon DigardJessi LaChanceKey TakeawayThe results of this study suggest that a broad, permissivestatute is not enough to ensure that people with serious illnesses andincapacitating medical conditions are successfully identified, processed, andreleased in a timely manner. Vera’s recommendations suggest modifications topolicy and practice that could help increase the use of compassionate releaseas a viable mechanism to alleviate the suffering of people in the state’s prisons.Publication HighlightsCompassionate release generally refers to policies and laws under which medical and correctional administrators, parole boards, and/or the courts grant early discharge from prison to people on the basis of serious illness or age-related impairment.These laws are premised on a humanitarian desire to allow people to spend their remaining days outside of prison in the company of their family and friends, as well as practical considerations of the high cost and minimal public safety value of incarcerating people who are old or gravely ill.Even people who are referred, eligible, and granted release by the New York State Board of Parole face a formidable challenge in finding a community placement that can accommodate their medical and nursing needs.Key FactsFrom 1993 to 2013, the number of people age55 and older in state prisons grew400%Nearly 3,500 people died in state prisons in 2014 and59%of them were older adultsFrom 2008 to 2017, while the overall population in New York’s prisons decreased nearly 20%,the number of people age 55 and older increased60%Older adults now represent11%of the population in New York State prisonsTwiceas many medical parole applicants die in custody than are releasedAnalysis of compassionate release requests in New York State prisons from 2013 through 2015 revealed that just12%of these requests ended in a person’s releaseRelatedSPOTLIGHTA Direction HomeApr 24, 2017NEWSElderly people in prison present little risk, but staggering costsJul 06, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
