The Bureau of Justice Statistics collects this data, but their reports lag prison populations by a year or more.In order to get an earlier glimpse at these numbers, Vera researchers collected information directly from states and the federal Bureau of Prisons to estimate the number of people in prison at the end of 2017. The data revealed that the recent trend of decreasing prison incarceration continued in 2017, with the total U.S. prison population dropping below 1.5 million for the first time since 2004. Despite the overall declines, 20 states increased their prison population, leaving 10 states with all-time-high numbers of people in prison.Despite the national reduction in the prison population, more work is required to unwind mass incarceration.AuthorsOliver HindsJacob Kang-BrownOlive LuPrison Population Change 2016-2017Adjust arrows to view the four different combinations of population trends and incarceration rate.

These declines are not universal, however, and some state prison populations are continuing to increase.Publication HighlightsMore up-to-date data about prison populations allows more timely feedback about the success of criminal justice reforms, and insight into the places to target future reform efforts.The number of people in U.S. prisons continues to decline, but at a much slower rate than it grew during the rise of mass incarceration.The number of people in federal prison continues to drop sharply (more than 3 percent in 2017). This is in spite of new guidelines for federal prosecutors, who are now instructed to seek sentences that are as harsh as possible.Key FactsIn 2017,the U.S. prison population fell by 19,400—to 1,486,000.The nationwide prison incarceration rate fell by2%The number of people in federal prisons fell by more than3%30 states reduced the number of people in prison,while 20 states increased it.10 states had an all-time-high number of people in prison in 2017.11 states were within 5% of their peak.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
