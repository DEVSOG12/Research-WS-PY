The Oklahoma City Housing Authority, the Lafayette Housing Authority, and Northern Illinois Regional Affordable Community Housing (NI ReACH) recently reexamined their admissions policies to improve access. These housing authorities are partners in Vera’s Opening Doors to Public Housing initiative, funded by the Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance. These flyers were created to publicize important changes and existing policy to community members impacted by the justice system, reentry service providers, and corrections stakeholders.An important aspect of admissions policies for applicants with conviction histories is the length of the “look-back period”— the amount of time from a conviction that the authority considers relevant. Reducing the look-back period, which these housing authorities have done, expands opportunities for applicants. Other steps to increase access include giving less weight to arrests and evictions and actively pursuing evidence of mitigating circumstances and relevant program participation.RelatedNEWSFinding housing is hard—but for people leaving prison and jail, it’s almost impossibleAug 30, 2018PUBLICATIONOpening DoorsSep 29, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
