However, evidence mounts that the practice produces many unwanted and harmful outcomes—for the mental and physical health of those placed in isolation, for the public safety of the communities to which most will return, and for the corrections budgets of jurisdictions that rely on solitary confinement to keep their facilities safe. This publication, part of Vera’s Safe Alternatives to Segregation Project, examines what we know about the use and misuse of solitary confinement, and ways to safely reduce it in our nation’s correctional facilities.AuthorsAlison ShamesJessa WilcoxRam SubramanianKey TakeawaySolitary confinement is increasingly being recognized in the United States as a human rights issue, yet it remains a mainstay of prison management and control in the U.S. This is because many policymakers, corrections officials, and members of the general public still subscribe to common misconceptions addressed in this report—including that solitary is used only as a last resort for the most violent offenders.Publication Highlights“…[I]t’s anything but quiet. You’re immersed in a drone of garbled noise—other inmates’ blaring TVs, distant conversations, shouted arguments. …[I] was left feeling twitchy and paranoid. .. I began to count the small holes carved in the walls. Tiny grooves made by inmates who’d chipped away at the cell as the cell chipped away at them.” — Rick Raemisch, director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, after testing the experience of solitary to inform reform efforts.Key FactsSolitary confinement has grown substantially in recent years— by as much as42%between 1995 and 2005, according to estimates.The estimated80,000 to 100,000 people in solitary confinement is likely an undercount, as the number does not include people in jails, military facilities, immigration detention centers, or juvenile justice facilities.RelatedNEWSGardner Fellow Danny Murillo on life after solitaryAug 01, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
