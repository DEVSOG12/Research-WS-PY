It is addressed primarily to foster care social workers, is designed for use as a text for training them, and serves as a reference source for all practitioners. Part One describes the nature of foster child maltreatment and practices that place foster children at risk of maltreatment. Part Two reviews issues of child protection in each aspect of the placement process—homefinding, certification, training of foster parents, matching, ongoing casework, and recertification—and presents guidelines for improving the quality of foster care. The final chapter presents a review of law, regulations, and guidelines concerning reporting and investigation of foster child maltreatment.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
