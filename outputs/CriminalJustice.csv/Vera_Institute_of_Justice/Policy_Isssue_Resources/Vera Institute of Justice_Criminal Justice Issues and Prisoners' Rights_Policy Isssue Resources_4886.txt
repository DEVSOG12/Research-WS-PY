By identifying heavy users and giving detention authorities a new treatment option, Vera hopes to overcome obstacles to starting treatment at the earliest possible moment. And by creating a treatment provider with authority to follow adolescents from agency to agency and into the community, we hope to eliminate the breaks in treatment that usually coincide with these transitions.AuthorsJean Callahan34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
