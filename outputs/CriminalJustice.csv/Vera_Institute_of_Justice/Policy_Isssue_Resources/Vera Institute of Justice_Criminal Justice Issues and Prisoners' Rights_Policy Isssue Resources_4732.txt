Yet many people who work in corrections do not know how to help individuals on their caseload draw on these social supports. This report describes the Family Justice Program’s Reentry is Relational project, which implemented the Relational Inquiry Tool (RIT)—a series of questions designed to prompt conversations with incarcerated men and women about the supportive people in their lives—in prisons in Oklahoma and New Mexico. The report also discusses results from surveys and interviews with incarcerated men and women and their family members that were conducted as part of the implementation process.AuthorsMargaret diZeregaSandra Villalobos Agudelo34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
