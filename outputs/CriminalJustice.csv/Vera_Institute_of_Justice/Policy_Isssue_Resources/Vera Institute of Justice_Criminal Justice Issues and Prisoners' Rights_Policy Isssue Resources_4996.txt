It was designed to explain officers' views of the legitimacy and fairness of the Police Department's review mechanism. The report recommends that the Department establish forums in which officers can express their views and at the same time begin to consider the complexities of appropriate police-citizen interaction, and suggests such forums might have a positive influence on police culture.AuthorsMichele Sviridoff34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
