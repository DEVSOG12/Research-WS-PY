This report from that task force, presenting the state’s first-ever set of multi-agency indicators, identifies and calculates key data in five central areas of the juvenile justice system, from arrest through disposition. Section I describes each of the five system areas, provides a synopsis of the indicators for each area, and highlights some initial observations revealed by 2004 data. Section II presents statewide aggregate juvenile justice indicators. Section III provides local-level data for each of New York’s 62 counties.AuthorsDerek Coursen34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
