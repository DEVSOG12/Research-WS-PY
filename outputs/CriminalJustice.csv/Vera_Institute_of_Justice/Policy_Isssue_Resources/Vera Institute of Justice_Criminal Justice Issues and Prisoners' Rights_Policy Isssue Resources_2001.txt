To make this task easier—and subsequently, get people the services and support they need while also generating evidence against their traffickers—Vera created and validated a screening tool to be used by victim service providers and law enforcement when faced with someone who may be a victim of sex or labor trafficking. The tool, a 30-topic questionnaire that was tested by service providers across the U.S., is the result of a two-year study funded by the National Institute of Justice. It is available at no cost and no permission is required.AuthorsLaura SimichLucia GoyenAndrew PowellKaren BerberichKey TakeawayThis tool gives legal, health care and social service providers, law enforcement, and other professionals the ability to bring trafficking victims out of the shadows and improve their legal and social outcomes.Publication HighlightsVera has been working since 2006 to research and develop reliable and effective practices for identifying trafficking victims; this is the first trafficking victim identification tool to be statistically validated in the United States.While every state has enacted anti-trafficking legislation, only a small fraction of trafficking victims have been identified because victims are commonly hidden and living in fear.The screening tool may be used in either its full form or in a briefer 16-question version. The two versions, available in both English and Spanish, may also be used in succession at separate times, such as initial intake (short version) and deeper investigation once the victim is more comfortableKey Facts57,000 to 63,000people are currently enslaved or trafficked in the U.S.Though it is difficult to identify an accurate count, this is the most recent estimate.Less than1%of current trafficking victims in the U.S. have been identified, according to a 2010 estimate by the U.S. Department of State.RelatedNEWSHuman trafficking still with us 150 years after Emancipation ProclamationJan 22, 201334 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
