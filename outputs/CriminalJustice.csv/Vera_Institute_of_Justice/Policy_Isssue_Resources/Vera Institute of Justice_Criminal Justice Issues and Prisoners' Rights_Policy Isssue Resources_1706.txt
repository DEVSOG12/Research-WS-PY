Vera researchers estimated the incarcerated population using a sample of approximately 1,600 jail jurisdictions, 50 states, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The data shows that a little more than a year since the first calls to release incarcerated people during the COVID-19 pandemic, decarceration efforts appear to have stalled—even as the pandemic still rages and the country continues to lead the world in incarceration. The relative stasis in incarceration since late 2020 is the result of a refilling of many jails and a small, further decrease in prison populations.AuthorsJacob Kang-BrownChase MontagnetJasmine HeissKey TakeawayJail and prison population changes reflected a deepening of preexisting political, economic, and social orientations toward punishment and detention. Racial inequalities in incarceration rates increased, and states and counties with high incarceration rates prior to the pandemic tended toward relative inaction during the pandemic.Publication HighlightsAfter an unprecedented 14 percent drop in incarceration in the first half of 2020—from 2.1 million people to 1.8 million—incarceration declined only slightly from fall 2020 to spring 2021.By spring 2021, jail populations increased 13 percent from the mid-2020 low, while state and federal prison populations declined by 9 percent.States that started 2020 with higher incarceration rates made fewer efforts to reduce incarceration through spring 2021.Key FactsBetween midyear 2020 and spring 2021,the total number of people incarcerated fell by only2%Prison populations fell by9%Jail populations increased by13%RelatedPUBLICATIONPeople in Jail and Prison in 2020Jan 25, 2021WHAT JAILS COST LANDINGWhat Jails CostMar 02, 2021PUBLICATIONPeople in Prison in 2019May 14, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
