Highlights of the impact analysis are: 1) of the property misdemeanor recidivists sentenced to the project in 1984, 57% would have drawn jail sentences without the project; 2) in 1984 program operations reduced the demand for jail cells by 99 cells; and 3) the jail terms that would have been drawn are short, but the number of cells needed to be reserved was significant, and given Rikers Island at an over capacity, the economic value to the City of reducing cell demand was substantial.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
