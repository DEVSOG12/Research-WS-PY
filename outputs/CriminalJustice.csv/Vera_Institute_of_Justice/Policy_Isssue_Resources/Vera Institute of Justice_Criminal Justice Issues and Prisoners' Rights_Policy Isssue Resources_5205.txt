The project hopes to demonstrate that early diversion from the criminal process to employment and/or job training will combat recidivism; reduce court backlogs; reduce expenditures for prosecution, trial and incarceration; increase the supply of skilled labor; and provide a tax-paying, trained asset to the community in the form of a law-abiding employee, rather than a liability in the form of a prisoner.AuthorsHerbert Sturz34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
