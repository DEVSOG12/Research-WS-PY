The objective are to respond to indigent families with drug-addicted relatives, to increase the effectiveness of existing non-residential and post-residential treatment programs for neighborhood residents who are involved with the criminal justice system, and to make better use of the extensive resources now devoted to impoverished substance abusers by the criminal justice and health care systems. We expect to improve the effectiveness of treatment by working with addicts' families, and thereby redirect some criminal justice and healthcare resources.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
