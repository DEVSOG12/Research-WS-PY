But filing for financial aid while incarcerated can be a formidable challenge. Drawing on the experiences of the first group of SCP colleges, this toolkit, drafted in collaboration with the Chemeketa Community College, is designed to aid new and existing participants as they guide students through the complexities of filing for federal financial aid in prison, including completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA.Authors​Allan WachendorferMichael BudkeKey TakeawayThis toolkit discusses federal financial aid eligibility requirements that often stymie incarcerated college students, such as Selective Service registration, issues with defaulted loans, crime-specific restrictions that may affect eligibility, and the documents required to obtain need-based aid. It also provides strategies to help students in prison overcome these difficulties.Publication HighlightsFinancial aid can help incarcerated students gain access to postsecondary education in prison, but colleges and students must be aware of the complexities of administering Pell Grants in the corrections environment.Many of the means on-campus students use to apply for financial aid—such as Internet access, telephoning, and written correspondence—are forbidden or highly restricted to students in prisons.At more than $28 billion aid awarded in the 2017–2018 award year, Pell Grants are the second largest source of need-based aid for postsecondary education, after federal student loans.Key FactsThe Second Chance Pell initiative serves more than10,000students in state and federal prisons.The SCP initiative operates in28 states through 64 colleges and is poised to expand in 2020.$6,195The maximum Pell Grant award for the 2019–2020 award yearRelatedPUBLICATIONSecond Chance Pell Experimental Sites Initiative UpdateJun 07, 2018PUBLICATIONExpanding Access to Postsecondary Education in PrisonJan 23, 2017NEWSFor Many, Second Chance Pell Offers a First Chance OpportunityApr 18, 201934 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
