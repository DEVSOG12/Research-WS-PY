Indeed, increased rates of incarceration have no demonstrated effect on violent crime and in some instances may increase crime. There are more effective ways to respond to crime—evidenced by the 19 states that recently reduced both their incarceration and crime rates. This brief summarizes the weak relationship between incarceration and crime reduction, and highlights proven strategies for improving public safety that are more effective and less expensive than incarceration.AuthorsDon StemenKey TakeawayIncreased incarceration has a marginal-to-zero impact on crime. In some cases, increased incarceration can even lead to an increase in crime.Publication HighlightsResearch shows that any crime reduction benefits from increased incarceration apply only to property crimes. Higher incarceration rates are not associated with lower violent crime rates.Each increase in incarceration rates is associated with increasingly smaller reductions in crime rates.The United States is spending heavily on jails and prisons while under-investing in less expensive, more effective ways to reduce and prevent crime.Key FactsOver the past 20 years19 stateshave successfully decreased both inprisonment and crime rates.Somewhere between75-100%of the reduction in crime rates since the 1990s is explained by factors other than incarceration.The U.S. spent roughly$33Bon incarceration in 2000 for the same level of public safety it achieved in 1975 for $7.4 billion—less than a quarter the cost.RelatedPUBLICATIONMeasuring Public SafetyJul 20, 2017SPOTLIGHTFor the RecordJul 19, 2017PUBLICATIONThe Price of PrisonsMay 23, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
