With the county’s jail population surging, local government leaders, justice system practitioners, and community members became increasingly concerned about the public safety, fiscal, and human costs of jail overcrowding. To begin exploring ways to reverse the trend, the county convened the Incarceration Prevention and Reduction Task Force (Task Force), a multidisciplinary group of justice system and community member stakeholders.Building on the efforts of the Task Force, Whatcom County hired the Vera Institute of Justice to develop a more thorough understanding of the factors driving the growing number of people in jail and to identify opportunities for reduction. Vera’s final report to the Task Force offers a number of responsive strategies that Whatcom County can undertake to reduce the number of people in its jail without compromising public safety.AuthorsElizabeth SwavolaKristi RileyVedan Anthony-NorthStephen RobertsKey TakeawayThis report presents the findings from Vera’s assessment and recommendations for how Whatcom County can reduce its jail population and create a safer, more effective local justice system.Publication HighlightsRecommended reduction strategies include deflecting people away from the justice system before they enter jail; eliminating backlogs of outstanding warrants and preventing new warrants from issuing; shifting from relying on financial bail to data-driven, risk-based pretrial justice; and increasing case processing efficiency.The recommendations included in this report are based on Vera’s quantitative and qualitative research. They should be seen as a starting point, understanding that reform takes time, dedicated cross-system collaboration, ongoing data analysis, and leadership.To realize the benefits of jail population reduction fully, jurisdictions must continuously gather data to evaluate who may be safely released or diverted from jail.Key FactsFrom 1970 to 2014, the incarceration rate in Whatcom County—the number of people incarcerated in jail per 100,000 county residents—more than tripled,from 87 to 276.Nearly4,300people were admitted to the Whatcom County jail in 2016.Those who were booked into the jail more than once in 2016 (27% of all people admitted) accounted for51%of the bookings (3,197).Almost60%of the people detained in the jail in 2016 were held pretrial—meaning they had not yet been convicted of any crime.Women made up26%of total admissions to the Whatcom County jail in 2016, compared to 21% of jail admissions nationally.Native American people and black people made up14 and 7%of the average daily jail population in 2016, respectively, even though Native American people make up only 4% and black people make up only 2% of the county population.The starkest disparities existed for black men and Native American women.Black men were admitted to the jail at a rate 4.2 times the rate of white men, and Native American women were admitted to the jail at five times the rate of white women.62%of admissions to the jail had non-felony charges as the most serious charge.RelatedPUBLICATIONReport to Tulsa County Stakeholders on Jail Reduction StrategiesDec 14, 2017PUBLICATIONIncarceration's Front DoorFeb 11, 201534 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
