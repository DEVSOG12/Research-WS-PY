A key component of this initiative was the development of Worker Connect—a data integration system that allows provisioned city workers to view client information across multiple city agencies. Vera conducted a qualitative evaluation for the system, under contract with New York City’s Center for Economic Opportunity (CEO), to understand how city agencies use Worker Connect and to explore user perceptions of the system. This brief reports on the main findings as they relate to data integration, integrated service delivery, and user experience.AuthorsAllon YaroniVedan Anthony-NorthJacob Kang-Brown34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
