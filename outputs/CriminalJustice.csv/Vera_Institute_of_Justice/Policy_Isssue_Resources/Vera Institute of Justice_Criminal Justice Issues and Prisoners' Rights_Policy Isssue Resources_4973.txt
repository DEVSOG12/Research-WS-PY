The JPMC was designed to: 1) determine which admissions to Department of Corrections (DOC) custody result in the greatest use of jail resources; 2) determine how many inmates in DOC custody are eligible for the various existing programs, and the frequency with which admits are eligible for more than one program;3) determine the factors that predict future incarceration on felony defendants arraigned in Supreme Court; and 4) determined the characteristics of those who are not eligible for any current alternative program, and the pattern of their use of jail resources.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
