Addressing two primary concerns—the high rates of victimization against individuals with disabilities and the overrepresentation of individuals with mental illness in the criminal justice system—Turner outlines both the leading research and most promising programs in the field that can help ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to services and criminal justice interventions, and the mentally ill are safely diverted from entering the justice system.AuthorsNicholas Turner34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
