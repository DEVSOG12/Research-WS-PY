In this interactive report, Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) identifies the major trends and developments that occurred across the country during the first year of a new administration. It also looks ahead, to how this new landscape will inform criminal justice reform work in a critical election year. This isn’t the last word, but rather the start of a conversation about what is and isn’t working to reform America’s justice system.Join us.A Crisis with No End in SightThe United States continues to be in the grips of a surging drug overdose crisis driven largely by opioids.Is “Tough on Crime” Back, and Will It Slow Reforms?Much of police reform in the United States takes place at the state level and in the approximately 18,000 local law enforcement agencies.A Breakthrough Year for Bail ReformIn 2017, judges, defenders, advocates—and even prosecutors and law enforcement—took up bail and other pretrial reforms in an unprecedented way.Prosecutors Step into the Spotlight of Justice ReformThanks in part to grassroots organizing efforts seeking to reduce mass incarceration, a new conversation around local elected prosecutors emerged in 2017.As Public Defense Faces Crises, Supportive Bipartisan Coalitions EmergeOn the stage of criminal justice reform, the voice of one actor has too often been missing: the public defender.Reformers Look to Jails as a Key to Ending Mass IncarcerationAttention to the problem of mass incarceration in the United States has broadened beyond a concentration on state and federal prisons to include local jails.As Youth Incarceration Drops, Racial Disparities PersistDespite advances in reducing the number of incarcerated youth, pervasive disparities persist for youth of color at all points in the justice system.Advocates Mobilize to Defend Immigrants as Enforcement Ramps UpAlthough the news from 2017 was overwhelmingly unfavorable for immigrants in America, immigrants and their advocates did post some wins.Women Are Heard—and an Understanding of Who Victims Are ExpandsVictims or survivors of crime are poorly understood though they hold important keys to improving safety and justice in society.While Federal Sentencing Reform Efforts Look Bleak, States Push AheadGiven the climate in Washington, sentencing reform’s future is most likely at the state and local levels.States Take on Prison ReformWith the White House and Department of Justice following a “tough on crime” path, state leaders are now largely on their own in reforming the prison system.For Those Rejoining Society, a Multitude of Obstacles PersistDespite challenges, progress has been made in helping people to succeed after incarceration by providing opportunities for housing, education, and employment.LensesThere are important issues that transcend many or all categories of justice reform. Through “Lenses,” we present items from across the report’s Topics in order to elevate additional insights and inspire critical thinking.
