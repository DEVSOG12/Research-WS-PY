This issue brief details the lack of support available to young men of color who experience trauma, as well as potential causes and consequences of this service gap. When we better understand the needs and experiences of these survivors, we are better positioned to provide them with the support they need and deserve.AuthorsDanielle SeredKey TakeawayResearch indicates that young men of color are disproportionately the victims of crime and violence, but often do not get the help they need. Increased understanding of the causes and impacts of this disparity is needed in order to develop support to end it.Publication HighlightsThe media and society over-represent young men of color as aggressors or criminals, fueling a misperception that violence and pain impact young men of color less profoundly than others.Few victim services exist for the kind of crimes young men of color are most likely to experience, such as robbery, or that account for their specific culture and experiences.Due to cultural norms of masculinity and victimization, many young men of color do not identify as “victims,” even when describing experiences of being harmed.Key FactsHomicide is the leading cause of deathfor young black males ages 10 to 24.Young black men were the most likely demographic to be robbed every year,according to data collected over an 11-year period.92%of all victims of robberyand 91% of victims of assault receive no known assistance from victim service agencies.An estimated 28 to 45%of victims of violent crimesuffer from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a condition that can cause physical and mental health challenges ranging from cardiovascular and digestive disorders to anxiety and flashbacks.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
