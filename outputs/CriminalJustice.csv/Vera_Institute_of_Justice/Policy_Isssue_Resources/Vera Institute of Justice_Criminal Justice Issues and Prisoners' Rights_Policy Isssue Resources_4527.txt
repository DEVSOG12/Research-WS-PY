Through the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI), some states are working to expand a policy known as “compassionate release,” which allows people who meet certain aging or medical criteria to be released earlier than their statutory release dates. Yet significant challenges remain in designing policies that maximize this type of release. This report takes a review of compassionate release policies adopted by two states through the JRI, and offers suggestions that target the most common challenges faced by states that adopt or modify these policies.AuthorsRebecca SilberAlison ShamesKelsey ReidKey TakeawayThe implementation of compassionate release policies is a significant step forward in expanding medical and geriatric release. But the impact of these policies remains limited because so many people are ineligible, the criteria for release are so restrictive, and the process for approval is so burdensome.Publication HighlightsJRI is a data-driven approach to criminal justice policy that seeks to improve public safety, curb corrections costs, and reinvest the savings in evidence-based public safety strategies.This report offers case studies of Mississippi and South Carolina, and illustrates both the shape that compassionate release laws take and the barriers faced in designing and implementing these policies.The growing size of the elderly population is driven both by long sentences, particularly for violent offenses, and an increase in admissions of people who are age 55 or older.Key FactsFrom 1993 to 2013, the number of people 55 or older in the custodial state prison population increased400%Recidivism rates drop to just more than 2% in people ages 50-65 years old and to almostzerofor people older than 65.The cost of incarcerating older people isdoublethat of housing younger ones, due to health care expenses.To date, JRI legislative reforms in8 stateshave created or expanded release policies to reduce the number of elderly or infirm people in their custody.RelatedNEWSElderly people in prison present little risk, but staggering costsJul 06, 2015PUBLICATIONCommon GroundNov 04, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
