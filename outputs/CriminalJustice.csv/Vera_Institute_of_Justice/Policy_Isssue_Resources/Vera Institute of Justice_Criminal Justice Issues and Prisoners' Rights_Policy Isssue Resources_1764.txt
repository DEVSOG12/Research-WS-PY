A key driver of this movement has been the Renewing Communities initiative, a joint project of the Opportunity Institute and the Stanford Criminal Justice Center that sought to expand access to higher education among justice-involved people in California, both during and after incarceration. In 2016, the initiative announced a three-year partnership with seven pilot projects that provide postsecondary education and student support services in 14 public colleges and universities, housed in prisons, jails, and colleges across the state. The Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) conducted an evaluation of the Renewing Communities initiative between 2016 and 2019. The findings of Vera’s study, summarized here, draw on program data from, and student surveys administered at, all 14 sites. In-depth qualitative research was conducted at five of the community-based programs, housed at different colleges and universities across California.AuthorsLionel SmithLéon DigardKey TakeawayThe Renewing Communities initiative has been highly successful. More students have enrolled in the programs, and many of them have become high academic achievers. Notably, students greatly valued the staff members’ passion and dedication. Educational opportunities had vivid positive impacts on students’ identities, lives, and hopes for a brighter future.Publication HighlightsFor most incarcerated survey respondents, participation in facility-based education programs was their first time taking college-level coursework.Community-based students reported that their programs helped them with reentry and onboarding into campus life, assisted them with personal obstacles, and increased their feelings of self-efficacy and self-worth.Students described their programs as being safe spaces where similar experiences are shared and understood, providing them with a community of reliable and unconditionally supportive peers.Key FactsThe number of students enrolled in facility-based programs more thandoubledfrom 492 in fall 2016 to 1,064 in the most recently available data (up to spring 2019).75%of survey respondents indicated that they were the first college students within their families.37%of community-based students earned a GPA of 3.0 or higher in spring 2019.97%of incarcerated students intended to pursue their education beyond the current academic term.RelatedPUBLICATIONInvesting in FuturesJan 15, 2019PUBLICATIONMaking the GradeJul 18, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
