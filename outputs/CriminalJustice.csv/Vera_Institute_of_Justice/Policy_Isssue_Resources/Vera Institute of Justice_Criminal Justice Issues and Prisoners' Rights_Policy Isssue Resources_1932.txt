Despite recent scrutiny from policymakers and the public, one aspect of this growth has received little attention: the shocking rise in the number of women in jail.Women in jail are the fastest growing correctional population in the country—increasing 14-fold between 1970 and 2014. Yet there is surprisingly little research on why so many more women wind up in jail today. This report examines what research does exist on women in jail in order to begin to reframe the conversation to include them. It offers a portrait of women in jail, explores how jail can deepen the societal disadvantages they face, and provides insight into what drives women’s incarceration and ways to reverse the trend.AuthorsElizabeth SwavolaKristi RileyRam SubramanianKey TakeawayA foundation for reform exists and can potentially set the stage for further, well-crafted programs and practices to stem the flow of women cycling through the nation’s local jails. First, however, justice systems—both small and large—and community stakeholders must commit to bringing women into the discussion.Publication HighlightsSmall counties are driving the growth of the number of women in jail—with numbers increasing 31-fold between 1970 and 2014.Women often become involved with the justice system as a result of efforts to cope with life challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and significant physical or behavioral health struggles. Most are jailed for low-level, nonviolent offenses.Once incarcerated, women must grapple with systems designed primarily for men. As a result, many leave jail with diminished prospects for physical and behavioral health recovery, as well as greater parental stress and financial instability.Key FactsThe number of women in jail grew from under 8,000 in 1970to nearly 110,000in 2014.Nearly1/2of all jailed women are in small counties.Once a rarity, women are now held in nearly every county—a stark contrast to 1970,when73%of counties held not a single woman in jail.Nearly80%of women in jail are mothers, and most are single parents.Significant mental illness affects an estimated32%of women in jails—more than double the rate among men in jails.86%of women in jailreport having experienced sexual violence in their lifetime.Nearly2/3of incarcerated women in jail are of women of color—44% are black, 15% are Hispanic, and 5% are of other racial or ethnic backgrounds.The vast majority of women are in jailfor nonviolent offenses—32% for property offenses, 29% for drug offenses, and 21% for public order offenses.82%of jailed womenreport a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependency.RelatedVIDEOOverlooked: Women in JailsAug 17, 2016NEWSBreaking the silence about women in prisonAug 22, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
