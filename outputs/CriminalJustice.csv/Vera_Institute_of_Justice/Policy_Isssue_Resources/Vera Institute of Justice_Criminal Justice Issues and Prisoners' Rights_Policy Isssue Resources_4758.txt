Following the report’s release, a handful of counties indicated that local detention numbers in these categories were, in some cases, significantly higher than the numbers captured and maintained by the Juvenile Detention Automated System (JDAS), a centralized tracking system managed by the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS). This addendum, produced in partnership with OCFS, identifies the source of this discrepancy, offers revised figures where necessary, and reflects on their implications for future reportsAuthorsAnnie Salsich34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
