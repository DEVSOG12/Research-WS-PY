Surveys covered a number of topics including demographics, economic resources, housing situation, household and family status, and understanding of and experiences with the Section 8 program. The survey data was subsequently analyzed to identify salient themes and trends. We found that while the Section 8 program in New York City is increasingly overstretched, it was a vital resource for everyone that was surveyed.AuthorsRoohi Choudhry34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
