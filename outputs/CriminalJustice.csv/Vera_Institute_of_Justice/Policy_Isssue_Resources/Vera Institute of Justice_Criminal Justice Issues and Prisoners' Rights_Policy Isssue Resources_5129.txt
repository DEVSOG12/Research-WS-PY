The study includes a general literature search and discussions with judges, lawyers, probation officers, psychiatrists, researchers, administrators and other professionals dealing with delinquents, as well as with a number of juveniles with violent histories. The study included visits to programs and projects dealing with delinquents in a variety of ways. It also involved analysis of over 500 court records of juveniles in three counties in the New York metropolitan region, in order to determine firsthand the extent and nature of violence among children seen by the courts and the courts' responses to them.AuthorsPaul A.
