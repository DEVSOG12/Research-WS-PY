A Vera spin-off, CEO provides temporary jobs and other services to improve participants’ prospects in the labor market and reduce the odds that they will return to prison. Staff from Vera’s Cost Benefit Analysis Unit prepared the cost-benefit analysis presented in Chapter Four. Vera’s analysis showed that CEO’s financial benefits for taxpayers, victims, and participants outweigh its costs under a wide range of assumptions. The study found that most of the program’s benefits resulted from reduced criminal justice system expenditures, generating an estimated $1.26 to $3.85 in benefits per $1.00 of cost.AuthorsCindy Redcross34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
