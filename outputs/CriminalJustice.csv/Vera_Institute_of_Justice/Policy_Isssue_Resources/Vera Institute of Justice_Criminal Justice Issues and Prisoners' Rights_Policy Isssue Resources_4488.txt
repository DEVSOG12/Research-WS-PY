The survey targeted communities of varying sizes and regions to better understand the characteristics sought in the “model” police officer. The insights gleamed from these responses seek to provide guidance for police departments in retooling their recruitment and training strategies. With a better understanding of shared priorities and the effectiveness of various community engagement strategies, police departments across the country can begin to think about building more effective practices.Key TakeawayAmong both police departments and community members, building community trust was consistently ranked as the highest priority for a police officer. This priority should be acknowledged in the structuring of recruitment and training efforts.Publication HighlightsThe survey revealed that there are a wide variety of community engagement strategies already in place in most police departments—however opinions diverged between departments and community members on which of these strategies are most effective.Among the respondents to the survey, the average vacancy rate in the police department is 7 percent—meaning that authorized positions may be going unfilled—and there is room to improve and potentially modernize current recruitment efforts.Communities reporting the highest levels of police distrust were those with 10-20% African American population (44% indicated minority communities distrusted the police), 20-30% African American population (30% indicated that African Americans distrusted police) and 30% or more Hispanics (15% indicated that Hispanics distrusted police).Key FactsA recent workforce study found that the percentage of state and local governments rating police officers as “hard to recruit” positions grew from 3.3% in 2009 to26.5%in 2018A total of28jurisdictions in 23 states participated in the surveyRelatedPUBLICATIONPolice Perspectives Guidebook SeriesFeb 12, 2016NEWSThe supervisor’s role in promoting fair and impartial policingApr 02, 2015NEWSStronger Together: Vera’s Policing Program Works to Bridge the Divide between Police and CommunityOct 16, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
