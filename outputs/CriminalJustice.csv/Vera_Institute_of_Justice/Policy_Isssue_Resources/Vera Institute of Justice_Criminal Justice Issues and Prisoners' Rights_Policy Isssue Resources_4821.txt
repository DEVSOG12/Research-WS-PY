This report examines the operations and outcomes of the Instant Response Team program, a collaboration between the New York City Administration for Children's Services and the New York Police Department that aims to have child protective workers, police, and, when appropriate, prosecutors respond to reports of severe child abuse or neglect within two hours and to conduct joint interviews of victims. The report found a measurable impact on services to children, and staff from all three agencies express support for the program.AuthorsTimothy Ross34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
