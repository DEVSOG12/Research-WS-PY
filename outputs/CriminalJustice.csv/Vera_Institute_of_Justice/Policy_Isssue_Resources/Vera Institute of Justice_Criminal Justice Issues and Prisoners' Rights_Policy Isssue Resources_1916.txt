In the midst of this devastation, people are struggling to find ways to save the lives of their community members. While the “war on drugs” created tough enforcement policies that resulted in a bloated justice system, there is increasing momentum for a smarter and more compassionate approach to people who use drugs. This report describes how some innovative jurisdictions are implementing harm reduction strategies in order to reduce overdose deaths, improve the wellbeing of justice system-involved people, and advance the health and safety of their communities. It shares perspectives from stakeholders in law enforcement, the court system, corrections agencies, drug policy, and the community about what strategies are being implemented, how they have overcome barriers, and what work remains to be done.AuthorsLeah PopeChelsea DavisDavid CloudAyesha Delany-BrumseyKey TakeawayTransforming the criminal justice system from a “life-interruption model” to an avenue for increased recovery options necessitates that the system is capable of providing evidence-based substance use treatment—a standard that includes embracing harm reduction.Publication HighlightsThe widespread stigma around drug use and the risk of facing criminal penalties discourages users from seeking help and promotes risky practices that increase rates of infectious disease and death.Harm reduction is a public health philosophy and set of practical strategies that seeks to reduce the negative consequences associated with drug use. Such strategies can be incorporated at different points in the community and criminal justice system, from pre-arrest to post-reentry.Current harm reduction strategies include law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD), medication-assisted treatment (MAT), distribution of naloxone (an antidote to opioid overdoses), and syringe exchange programs (SEPs).Key FactsIn 2014, an average of 129 people died each day from drug overdoses, including 78 people who died from overdoses on opioids.Since 2000, drug overdose deaths have increased 137%, and opioid overdose deaths have increased 200%Overdose deaths are now the leading cause of injury-related death in the U.S., overtaking motor vehicle accidentsUp to 65 percent of incarcerated people meet the criteria for substance abuse or dependence.Only 56% of drug courts offered medication-assisted treatment as of 2010 even though 98% had participants with opioid addictions.Federal funding for drug courts is now contingent upon making medication-assisted treatment available to participants47 states have passed legislation designed to improve public naloxone accessRelatedVIDEOA New NormalFeb 21, 2017PUBLICATIONFirst Do No HarmNov 16, 2015NEWSWhat Congress lifting the federal ban on needle exchange programming could mean for law enforcementJan 12, 201634 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
