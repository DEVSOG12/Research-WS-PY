This report details the efforts of New York State to implement an overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) program to one particularly vulnerable population—people who have been recently released from incarceration in state prison. The report assesses the results of New York State’s efforts, and offers insights for other correctional systems seeking to implement OEND programs.AuthorsVedan Anthony-NorthLeah PopeStephanie PottingerIzzy SederbaumKey TakeawayEnsuring that naloxone is available where there is the greatest chance for an overdose requires more focused attention on distribution to populations that have increased risk of overdose mortality. Given the heightened risk of overdose death upon release from incarceration, it is essential that jurisdictions make a broader commitment to ensuring that people who are incarcerated have naloxone on hand when they return to the community.Publication HighlightsNew York State’s OEND program trained people who are incarcerated, their family members, and corrections staff to recognize and respond to the signs of opioid overdose, and made naloxone kits available to incarcerated people upon release.People who were incarcerated expressed almost uniformly favorable views of the OEND program.Although there was high uptake of kits overall, not everyone who was trained took a naloxone kit—some cited their distrust of the justice system and concerns about the laws designed to offer legal protections for people reporting an overdose.Key FactsMore than 64,000 Americans died of drug overdose deaths in 2016—a21%increase from 2015.Nearly60%of drug overdose deaths in 2015 involved an opioid.Overdose deaths from opioids increased nearlythreefoldbetween 2002 and 2015New York State has been especially gripped by the crisis—between 2014 and 2015 the overdose death rate from synthetic opioids (other than methadone) increased135%.An estimated58%of people incarcerated in state prisons and 63% of the sentenced population in local jails meet criteria for drug dependence or abuse.One study showed that people returning to the community after incarceration were more than129Xmore likely to die of a drug overdose in the first two weeks after release than other state residents.RelatedVIDEOA New NormalFeb 21, 2017PUBLICATIONA New NormalFeb 21, 2017NEWSTo End Opioid Crisis, We Must Rely on More than "Just Say No"Oct 27, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
