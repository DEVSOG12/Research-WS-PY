NDLP was a response to a persistent problem: public defenders' absence when criminal justice policy was being set. Judges, police chiefs, prosecutors and sheriffs were used to collaborating. Defenders were often unsure how to make their perspectives known and suffered accordingly. The criminal justice system works only when all of its components—law enforcement, prosecution and defense—play an equal role, and with defenders in the background, it was off balance.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
