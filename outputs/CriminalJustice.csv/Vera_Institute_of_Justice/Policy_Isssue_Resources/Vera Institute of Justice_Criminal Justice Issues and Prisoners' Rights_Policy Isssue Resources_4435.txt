This report fills a gap until the Bureau of Justice Statistics releases its report on jail population statistics in 2019—likely in early 2021.

The results are broken down by jurisdiction type and across years, showing diverging trends between urban, suburban, small/midsized metropolitan, and rural areas.AuthorsJacob Kang-BrownOliver HindsEital Schattner-ElmalehJames Wallace-LeeKey TakeawayThe estimated midyear jail population was 1.8 percent higher than in midyear 2017, part of a four-year increase in the total U.S. jail population.
