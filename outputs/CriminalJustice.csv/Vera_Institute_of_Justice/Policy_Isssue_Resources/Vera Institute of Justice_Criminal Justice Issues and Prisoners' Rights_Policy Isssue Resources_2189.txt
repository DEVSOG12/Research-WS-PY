Vera's strategy for spurring innovation has been to advance each of the purposes criminal sentences serve, often simultaneously, resisting temptation to privilege any one purpose or constituency. From Vera's early success refining community service as punishment to the recent initiative to help state leaders advance reforms, the Institute has expanded the way people in government think about sentencing and corrections and increased their options for dealing justly with individuals who break the law. This brief history chronicles Vera's work in this area while highlighting key findings and results. It also includes a timeline of Vera projects and a bibliography.AuthorsJennifer Trone34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
