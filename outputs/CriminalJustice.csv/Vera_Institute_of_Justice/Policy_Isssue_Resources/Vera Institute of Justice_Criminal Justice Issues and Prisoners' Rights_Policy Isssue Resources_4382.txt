The crowded and congregate nature of jails, prisons, and detention centers—where 2.3 million people are incarcerated and tens of thousands of staff work each day—pose a unique threat for the infection and spread of COVID-19. It is imperative to act immediately and decisively to combat COVID-19 behind bars. In this brief, Vera recommends ways that President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris can manage this crisis consistent with public health and safety by (1) reducing the number of people incarcerated to ease overcrowding; (2) protecting people who remain incarcerated by implementing best practices for prevention, testing, and containment; and (3) reorganizing correctional operations for social distance, not isolation or punishment.RelatedPUBLICATIONCoronavirus Guidance for the Criminal and Immigration Legal SystemsMar 17, 2020SPOTLIGHTCriminal Justice and the COVID-19 PandemicMay 06, 2020NEWSCOVID-19 Imperils People in Rural JailsApr 01, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
