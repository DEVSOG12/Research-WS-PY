These children come to the United States seeking protection, stability, and a chance to reunite with their families, but are instead processed at federally run stations and incarcerated in jail-like conditions with often freezing temperatures, inadequate food and water, limited access to showers and hygiene products, and no access to private toilets, sinks, or beds.Rather than incarcerating unaccompanied children in such awful conditions, there is another way: to urge the federal government to respond to their arrival with compassion, not confine­ment, and to work as quickly as possible to reunify them with family and kin in the United States. This brief provides concrete recommendations to states and localities to intervene and use their authority toward this goal.AuthorsShaina AberLauren EsterleDerek LohKey TakeawayBy implementing Vera’s policy recommendations, states and localities can take steps, including urging the federal government to adopt an evidence-based child welfare approach and to support the quick release and reunification of children with kinship caregivers, to protect unaccompanied children as they arrive in the United States.Publication HighlightsUnder certain conditions, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) can place children in unlicensed emergency sites with horrific conditions and no set time frame for moving them into state-licensed care.ORR’s unlicensed Emergency Intake Sites and emergency reception centers can be anywhere ORR can find space, including Department of Defense bases, Department of Labor camps, or space leased from state agencies and private entities.States and localities play a critical role in safeguarding the rights of children in immigration custody through licensing the residential placements to which children are sent while awaiting reunification.Key FactsAbout65,000unacompanied children were apprehended by CBP after arriving in the United States in the first five months of 2021.With limited exceptions, federal law gives the Department of Homeland Security72 hoursto transfer unaccompanied children from CBP holding areas to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.The federal government currently takes an average of30 daysto reunify unaccompanied children with their families.RelatedPUBLICATIONEight Ways to Ease the Child Detention CrisisApr 22, 2021NEWSEnd the Cycle of Crises for Unaccompanied Immigrant ChildrenApr 27, 2021PUBLICATIONImplementing the Vision at the Local and State Level SummaryApr 13, 202134 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
