The scope of 911 has expanded and technological infrastructure has evolved, but there have been few advances in the call-taking and dispatching aspects of the system over the last 52 years. Modernization is needed if 911 is to provide fully effective service.Criteria Based Dispatching (CBD) is an alternative approach to traditional 911 triage that has revolutionized the call-taking process for medical and fire calls. Instead of the call-taker collecting as much information as possible on the event that prompted the 911 call, CBD focuses on asking specific “here and now” questions to determine the necessary level of care and the urgency of the need. This review of the literature on CBD frames how this approach could also lead to improvements in policing.RelatedPUBLICATIONThe 911 Call Processing SystemJul 19, 2019SPECIAL REPORT (CHAPTERED)Behavioral Health Crisis AlternativesNov 12, 2020PUBLICATIONUnderstanding Police EnforcementSep 29, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
