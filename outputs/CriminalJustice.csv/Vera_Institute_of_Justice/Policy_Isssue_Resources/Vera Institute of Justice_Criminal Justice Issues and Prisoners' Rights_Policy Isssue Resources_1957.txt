The indicators help practitioners track progress towards specific goals and refine their capacity-building efforts to better meet those goals over time. They also draw upon data and resources that organizations typically have access to and provide step-by-step information on implementation, including how to collect, analyze, and interpret their data.AuthorsNancy SmithSandra HarrellJaclyn SmithAshley DemyanKey TakeawayThis practical tool meets the growing need for straightforward and cost-effective ways for disability organizations, domestic violence programs, rape crisis centers, and dual programs that address domestic and sexual violence to track their progress in serving survivors of domestic and sexual violence who have disabilities.Publication HighlightsThe indicators in this guide give organizations a first-of-its-kind comprehensive tool to track and improve their capacity to serve people with disabilities who have experienced domestic and sexual violence, as well as step-by-step instructions for implementation the indicators.The indicators measure an organizations level of commitment to addressing domestic and sexual violence against people with disability and to what extent it has the capacity (knowledge, skills, and resources) required to do so.The indicators are designed to be measured every six months so providers can track their progress and make adjustments as needed to maximize the impact of their capacity-building efforts.Key FactsResearch has shown that people with disabilities experience violent victimization—including rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault—at rates 2.5 times higher than people without disabilities.People with disabilities routinely face barriers to helpwhen reaching out to services,from staff members not knowing how to respond to limited to no connections with local victim services organizations who could help if referrals were made.There is a dearth of informationabout whether current reform efforts to address the gaps in service are effective.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
