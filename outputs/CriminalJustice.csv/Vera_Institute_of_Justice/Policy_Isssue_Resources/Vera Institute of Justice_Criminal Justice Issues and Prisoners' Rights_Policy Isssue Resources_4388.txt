Expanding use of civil detention is often justified by the government as being necessary to ensure that immigrants continue to attend court proceedings. This fact sheet reviews evidence from the Vera Institute of Justice’s programs and related studies as well as government data analyzed by independent researchers to unpack what is known about appearances in immigration court and, alternately, orders of removal in absentia, which are issued when a person does not appear in court. It offers a collection of data showing that the majority of immigrants—including adults, families, and children—have shown up for immigration court hearings over the past two decades.Key TakeawayIrrefutable evidence shows that over the past two decades the majority of immigrants have shown up for immigration court hearings. Rates of appearance increase when people have legal representation, calling into question the logic of detaining people in prison-like conditions when representation is a viable alternative to ensure court appearances.Publication HighlightsNon-detained immigrants with legal representation nearly always come to court.Many immigrants receive orders of removal in absentia because flaws in the overburdened immigration hearing system prevent them from receiving adequate notice of their hearings.Asylum seekers nearly always show up for court hearings, regardless of whether they have legal representation.Key Facts98%of SAFE clientsreleased from detention over the past three years have continued to appear for their scheduled court hearings.More than95%of children represented by lawyers appeared for their immigration court proceedings.More than500Kimmigrants were confined in detention facilities in fiscal year 2019.RelatedPUBLICATIONSupport Universal Representation: SAFE Initiative 101Oct 15, 2020NEWSI Was Sure I Would Be Deported Until an Attorney Informed Me of My RightsOct 16, 2020PUBLICATIONCommunity Supervision Proves Detention is Unnecessary to Ensure Appearance at Immigration HearingsSep 11, 202034 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
