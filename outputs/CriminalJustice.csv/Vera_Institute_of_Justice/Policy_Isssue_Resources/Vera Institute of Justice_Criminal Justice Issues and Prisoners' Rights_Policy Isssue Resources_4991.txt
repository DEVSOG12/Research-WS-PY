The practical and conceptual issues raised by such a policy are complex and require much discussion. This 1990 CASES briefing paper provides a framework for this discussion by: 1) addressing some of the treatment questions the literature presents; 2) outlining one framework for looking at the range of treatments available; 3) exploring the implications of attempting to match clients with appropriate treatments; 4) describing the treatment modalities available; 5) proposing a way of looking at stages of change; and 6) raising questions about the impact these issues have on the field of alternatives to incarceration.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
