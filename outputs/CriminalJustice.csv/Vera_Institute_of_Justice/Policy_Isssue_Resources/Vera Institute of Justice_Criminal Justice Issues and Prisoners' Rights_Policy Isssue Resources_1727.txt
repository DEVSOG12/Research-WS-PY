One of those programs is TeleStory, an initiative by which families can use video equipment in the library to virtually visit a loved one who is incarcerated in a New York City Department of Correction facility. These visits provide a helpful supplement to in-person visitation, and they afford community members who are unable to travel to a correctional facility the opportunity to meet with loved ones nonetheless. This report details a comprehensive process evaluation of TeleStory undertaken by Vera researchers at the request of BPL staff.AuthorsDavid PittsLionel SmithKey TakeawayTeleStory appears to be a very effective program that consistently meets its objectives and has a high degree of satisfaction among users. BPL has invested significant resources in training and staff development, all toward improving service delivery and staff buy-in.RelatedPUBLICATIONClosing the DistanceAug 15, 2017PUBLICATIONA New Role for TechnologyMar 02, 2016NEWSVideo Visits in Prisons Enhance Connections, But at a CostAug 15, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
