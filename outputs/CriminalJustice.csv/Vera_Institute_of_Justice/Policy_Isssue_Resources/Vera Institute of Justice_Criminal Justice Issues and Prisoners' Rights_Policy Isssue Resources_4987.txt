In 1986, Vera was asked by the New York State Legislature to help implement and evaluate a policy initiative to develop innovative, effective treatment for State inmates and parolees with histories of drug and alcohol addiction. Focusing on continuity of care from prison to the community, the legislation led to the creation of a prison-based pilot program that offered inmates a short-term intensive treatment experience emphasizing preparation for a drug-free transition to the community. Also included are three interim reports on the project from February 1987, March 1988 and March 1989.34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your emailÂ© Vera Institute of Justice.
