OWs assist with proactive policing strategies such as referring community members to resources, applying system expertise to help individuals navigate it, and strengthening law enforcement-community relationships. The initiative doubles as an individualized reentry program for OWs, providing them with stable employment, trainings, and personal development opportunities. This case study examines the program in depth as well as its impact on local police-community relations.AuthorsRebecca NeusteterMegan O'TooleLibby DoyleRelatedNEWSCustomer Service in BlueMay 04, 2017NEWSHow police benefit from diversion strategiesJul 21, 2016NEWSNew Survey Aims to Learn How Police Involve Community in Decision-MakingJan 26, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
