Many service providers, however, embark on self-evaluations without the underlying infrastructure necessary to support evaluation. This guide helps these service providers assess their evaluation capacity and identify areas of strength, as well as areas for improvement.In addition to the publication, Vera has created a resource hub on its website to provide domestic and sexual violence service providers with access to five webinars that explore a number of topics addressed in the guide and provide an inside look at how organizations have applied these lessons in the field.AuthorsNancy SmithCharity Hope34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
