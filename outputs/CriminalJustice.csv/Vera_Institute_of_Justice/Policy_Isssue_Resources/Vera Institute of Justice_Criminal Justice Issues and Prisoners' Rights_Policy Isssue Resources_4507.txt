In contrast, the past decade has given rise to what is widely recognized as an era of reform, with prison admission rates declining by 24 percent since 2006 and jail admissions rates down 25 percent since 2008. The national declines, however, mask the new dynamics of mass incarceration.The growth that characterized mass incarceration’s rise has fractured into four dynamics that vary from state to state and county to county. Contemporary decarceration exists alongside continuous growth, stagnation, and jurisdictional shifts between prisons and jails, akin to a shell game. This report provides a first-in-kind look at the state of incarceration by moving beyond the convention of using state prison populations, illuminating both where meaningful change has happened and where true reform has remained elusive.AuthorsJacob Kang-BrownOliver HindsJasmine HeissOlive LuKey TakeawayAlthough we are in a widely recognized era of criminal justice reform, the overall decline in incarceration masks distinct trends that vary from state to state and county to county. Some states have meaningfully reduced incarceration, but others are stuck near all-time highs, continuing to incarcerate more and more people, or are shifting populations between prisons and jails.Publication HighlightsAs reforms have taken root across the country, state incarceration rates have fractured into four separate trends: decarceration, stagnation, jurisdictional shifts between prisons and jails, and continued growth.In some jurisdictions, reductions in prison populations have been offset by increases in the jail population, and vice versa.In some states that have shown significant progress in reducing overall incarceration, these declines have been driven almost exclusively by larger cities; small cities and towns continue to see incarceration rates grow.Key FactsThe U.S. prison incarceration rate increased400%between 1970 and 2000.Since the national peak in 2007,34 stateshave reduced their total (prison and jail) incarceration rates.Between 2010 and 2015,11 statesreduced their prison populations while simultaneously increasing the number of people held in jails.8 states hold more people in localjailsthan in state prisons.In the 35 states for which there is reliable county-level data,there is an almost universal urban-to-rural shift in prison admissions,regardless of whether admissions are declining in the state as a whole.The states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and West Virginia continue to incarcerate peoplein both prisons and jailsat all-time high rates that keep increasing year after year.If jails and prisons continue to grow in Kentucky as they have since 2000,everyone in the state will be incarcerated in113 years.Between 2013 and 2015,286bills, executive orders, or ballot initiatives targeting sentencing or corrections reform were advanced across 46 states.At the current pace, it will be146years until U.S. prison incarceration rates are as low as they were in 1970.Since 2006, the national rate of prison admissions has dropped by24 percent—due entirely to a 48 percent drop in 10 states.Four states continue to incarcerate people in bothprisons and jailsat all-time high rates.RelatedPUBLICATIONOut of SightJun 12, 2017PUBLICATIONPeople in Prison in 2017May 18, 201834 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
