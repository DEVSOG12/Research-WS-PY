This study aimed to analyze ways to increase and improve guardianship and decision support services for this challenging and often overlooked population. Specifically, it (1) documents the need for guardianship and decision support services for the population; (2) assesses the current local and state ability to meet that need; (3) explores the best practices of states providing comparable guardianship and decision support services; (4) assesses the TGP model of guardianship to ascertain if it is an appropriate model for expansion to meet the increased need in New York City and in other parts of the state; and (5) highlights barriers in court guardianship processes in New York City and State and improvements that might be made.AuthorsPamela B. TeasterErica F. WoodJohn HoltKimberly GeorgeKey TakeawayWhile data is lacking, the study’s surveys and interviews uncovered a compelling and undeniable unmet need for guardianship and related services for individuals in New York who are indigent, have been named by a court as “incapacitated,” and who have no one available to serve in that role.Publication HighlightsThe study uncovered a marked need for increased funding to provide for guardians in low-fee/no-fee cases where there is no one else to serve.New York’s Court are under-resourced resulting in delays, inefficiencies, and lack of oversight of guardiansA multidisciplinary team model approach to the provision of guardianship and related services, and a low ratio of staff to individuals served, is recommended for high quality, person-centered services.Key FactsBased on a study in 14 counties by the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College, on average, it takes211 daysfrom the filing of a petition for guardianship to the commissioning of a guardian.In New York, from 2007–2011, the average number of initial New York State guardianship filings under Mental Health Law Article 81, as reported by the Office of Court Administration, was almost2,400 casesper year.As of 2018, TGP serves180 clientsyear-round.New York State currently has3.7 percentolder people in 2025.Between 2010 and 2020, the population of people of color aged 60 plus will increase by51 percent.6.
