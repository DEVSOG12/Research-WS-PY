However, this era of public safety has been misrepresented by some media reports and public commentary concluding that violent crime increases in a few cities equal a sweeping national problem. This brief examines those erroneous conclusions about current crime trends—using both existing and original research—and describes how to avoid common pitfalls when interpreting statistics on violent crime.AuthorsBruce FrederickKey TakeawayViolent crime remains near its lowest point in decades and fears of a new violent crime wave are unfounded. Crime rates fluctuate over time and it is important that any discussion of statistics on violent crime takes account of these natural variations.Publication HighlightsOne or two annual increases is not sufficient to call a change a new trend: it is normal for crime rates to fluctuate from year to year.Recent increases in crime rates have been concentrated mostly among gun-related homicides in a few neighborhoods in a few major cities, where violent crime rates were already persistently high.The conditions and events that contribute to violent crime vary from place to place and require locally tailored crime prevention and law enforcement strategies.Key FactsAmong 10 cities highlighted by the New York Times for large increases in homicide counts in the first half of 2015, only4experienced continued increases in 2016.An analysis of 25 of the nation’s 30 largest cities found that three cities—Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, DC—accounted for1/2of the aggregate increase in homicide counts from 2014 to 2015.RelatedSPOTLIGHTFor the RecordJul 19, 2017PUBLICATIONAn Unjust BurdenMay 03, 2018PUBLICATIONThe Prison ParadoxJul 20, 201734 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
