These reforms involve a new code of criminal procedure, new public institutions such as the National Prosecution Service and office of National Public Defender, as well as new people, new buildings, new views, and new practices. Together with the National Prosecution Service, or Ministerio Público, the Vera Institute has charted these changes, and here reports on some of the important differences between the old system of justice, still functioning in Metropolitan Santiago, and the new system of justice that has gradually taken root in the rest of the country.AuthorsAntonio Marangunic34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
