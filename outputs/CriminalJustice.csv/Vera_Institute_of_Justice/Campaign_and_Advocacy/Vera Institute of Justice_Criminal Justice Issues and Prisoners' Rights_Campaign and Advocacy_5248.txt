It's time to invest in the things that help communities thrive.Our system of “justice” hasn’t made us safer. Instead, the criminal legal system has failed countless families, particularly in communities of color: families separated and plunged deeper into poverty, stagnating local economies, and causing persistent stigmatization. That’s why Vera is committed to not only shrinking and transforming the criminal legal system, but also to investing in evidence-based solutions that help communities thrive.To truly ensure everyone’s safety and well-being, our communities need better health care, schools, housing, drug treatment programs, and other social services. Vera is working hand-in-hand with advocates, experts, and policymakers to research and implement approaches in these areas and others, rooted in community perspectives and elevating the voices and needs of those who have been directly impacted by the system. Together, we’ll ensure that every family can truly thrive and live in dignity.Learn more about Vera’s work to invest in communities and help families thrive:Opening Doors to HousingMillions of people return to their communities from jails and prisons every year, but they face significant obstacles to finding safe, affordable housing.Learn moreEnding Girls' IncarcerationVera partners with government and community to disrupt the pathways leading girls and gender expansive youth into the juvenile justice system.Learn moreRedefining Public SafetyIt’s time for alternatives to policing, to end overpolicing and reduce racial disparities.Learn moreAdvancing Universal RepresentationEvery person facing deportation deserves high-quality legal representation regardless of income, race, national origin, or history with the criminal legal system.Learn moreJoin us as we strengthen communitiesHear about our work investing in familiesI’m in!Thank youfor signingup!Join us in thefight for justice.DonateHelp us spreadthe world!34 35th StreetSuite 4-2ABrooklyn, NY 11232212-334-1300About UsCareersEventsMediaContact UsKeep up with us on social media.Transformative change, sent to your inbox.Add your email© Vera Institute of Justice.
