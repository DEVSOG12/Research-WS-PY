While popular, this picture is not based on facts.Research on this subject has been limited, but it has consistently shown that white people are more likely than people of color to report having sold drugs.Still, in a country where 60% of people are white, 76% of federal prisoners convicted under trafficking laws are Black or Latino.In 2009 only 14% of people in federal prison for drug selling were categorized as importers, high level suppliers, organizers or leaders. Yet the government punishes all conduct, big and small, with severe sentences.Further, we often talk about people who sell drugs and people who use drugs as two distinct groups. In fact, they often overlap. Many people who sell drugs are involved in drug selling to support their own drug use.A survey of state prisons found that seven in ten people serving time for drug trafficking were also using drugs around the time of their offense.In a national survey, more than two in five people who reported having sold drugs also said they meet the criteria for a substance use disorder.It’s time to rethink the “drug dealer.” We need to have honest conversations about people involved in drug selling and distribution, and the harsh criminal penalties they face for even very minor roles in sales.Read more in our report.Learn More about Drug SellersIn these animated videos, you’ll learn about the racist origins of drug seller stereotypes, the myth of the drug kingpin, and who this broken system hurts the most.Watch Their StoriesWhy do people get involved in drug selling?
