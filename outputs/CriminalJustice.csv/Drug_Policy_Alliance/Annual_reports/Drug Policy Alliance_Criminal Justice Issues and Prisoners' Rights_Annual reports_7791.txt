Making your voice heard 
The work of the Drug Policy Alliance is both all about drugs and ultimately 
not really about drugs at all. 
We are at the front lines of much larger struggles 
in U.S. and international society—over what it 
means to remain a free society and how we deal 
with both real and phantom threats to health, life 
and security. 
The war on drugs is the new Jim Crow, providing 
a contemporary veneer for longstanding 
prejudices and discriminations. It’s the engine for 
record-breaking rates of arrests and incarceration 
in this country, the basis for depriving millions of 
Americans of the right to vote, and the justification 
for threatening and discriminating against tens 
of millions of Americans who have committed no 
harm against their fellow citizens. It’s provided 
the rationale for violating the sovereignty of 
foreign nations, and for blocking public health 
interventions that could save millions of people 
from dying of overdose or HIV/AIDS. 
We’ve devoted the past two decades to 
building the Drug Policy Alliance into an 
increasingly powerful force. Our growing success is in part a result of our determination 
and ability to bring together people who may 
agree on nothing more than the need to end 
the drug war. That will not change as we move 
forward in a new political climate.
Our core policy goals are widely accepted 
across the country: addiction must be treated 
as a health issue, incarceration needs to be 
drastically cut, and marijuana should simply be 
made legal. Looking back on the past year, we 
feel proud of our remarkable victories yet fully 
cognizant of the immense challenges ahead.
No other issue was on the ballot in so many 
states and no other issue won in so many 
places last November. Marijuana legalization 
initiatives prevailed in four out of five states, 
and medical marijuana initiatives prevailed in 
all four states. We’re especially proud of our 
leadership role on California’s Proposition 64, 
which sets a new gold standard for marijuana 
policy with its cutting edge provisions to 1

policies grounded in science, 
compassion, health and 
human rights because we 
believe those values should 
infuse all public policies. 
undo the most egregious harms of marijuana 
prohibition on impacted communities of color 
and with its sensible approaches to public 
health, youth protection, licensing and revenue 
allocation. 
Your support also helped us win many other 
harm reduction and criminal justice reform 
victories, perhaps most notably reforms in 
California and Florida that scale back civil 
asset forfeiture laws to protect people from 
unjust property seizures. 
We’re concerned, of course, by our new 
president’s opposition to commutations for non-
violent drug offenders and proposals to reform harsh drug laws; his rejection of restoring the 
right to vote to millions of Americans living with a 
felony conviction; his enthusiasm for discredited 
and unconstitutional “stop and frisk” police 
tactics; and his claim that the best way to deal 
with the opioid epidemic is to build a wall on the 
border with Mexico. 
Donald Trump’s election and his appointment of 
drug war extremists to senior positions are going 
to make it harder to consolidate our marijuana 
legalization victories, and to make progress 
in Congress on rolling back harsh drug laws, 
repealing civil asset forfeiture laws, reducing 
overdose fatalities, and integrating harm 
reduction principles into federal drug policies.
But what most concerns us is the likely assault 
on the values for which we’ve fought for so long.  2
We advocate for drug policies grounded in 
science, compassion, health and human rights 
because we believe those values should infuse 
all public policies. We fight against government 
oppression of people who use drugs—and 
even those who grow, make, sell and buy 
them—because we believe that no one should 
be persecuted and prosecuted for acts that do 
no harm to others. 
And we demand accountability for the harms 
perpetrated in the name of the war on drugs 
because we know that an open society can 
only live up to its ideals and flourish when 
government is held accountable both to law 
and basic standards of decency.
Only through our shared strength and vision 
can we uproot the drug war and advance the 
broader values that guide our struggle. 
We’re counting on your continued support to 
make this possible.

Making marijuana legal  
and ensuring responsible  
& equitable regulation
DPA works to repeal marijuana prohibition and create sensible systems of 
regulation for adult use. 
We work closely with government agencies to 
devise regulations even as we mobilize external 
pressure to ensure laws are implemented 
in good faith. Our public relations work has 
generated earned media coverage valued at 
tens of millions of dollars over the years, shaping 
national and international perception in ways that 
advance our agenda.
The 2016 election was a watershed moment 
for the movement to end marijuana prohibition. 
California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada 
legalized marijuana, while medical marijuana 
initiatives prevailed in Arkansas, Florida, 
Montana and North Dakota. DPA was involved in 
virtually all of these efforts, helping with drafting, 
funding and advocacy. Now almost 200 million 
Americans live in medical marijuana states 
and more than 60 million live in states where 
marijuana prohibition is a thing of the past.The most significant of these victories was 
California’s Proposition 64, which legalizes the 
adult use of marijuana in the nation’s largest 
state. It enacts across-the-board retroactive 
sentencing reform for marijuana offenses, 
while establishing a comprehensive system to 
tax and regulate businesses to produce and 
distribute marijuana in a legal market. Prop. 64 
sets a new gold standard for marijuana policy 
because of its cutting edge provisions to 
undo the most egregious harms of marijuana 
prohibition on impacted communities of color 
and the environment as well as its sensible 
approaches to public health, youth protection, 
licensing and revenue allocation.
The Drug Policy Alliance and its lobbying arm, 
Drug Policy Action, played a key leadership 
role in the California campaign—co-drafting the 
initiative, coordinating the political mobilization,

Last Fall, DPA collaborated with 
award-winning director dream 
hampton on a powerful video 
featuring Jay Z and the artwork of 
Molly Crabapple, From Prohibition 
to Gold Rush: A History of the 
War on Drugs , which has now 
been viewed by millions of 
people. Launched in the New York 
Times , the video addresses mass 
incarceration, racial discrimination 
in drug arrests, the emerging legal 
marijuana market, and the need to 
repair the drug war’s harms.
Now almost 200 million 
Americans live in medical 
marijuana states  and more than 
60 million live in states where 
marijuana prohibition is a thing 
of the past . 5

social media, public relations and more, and 
raising over $5 million to fund the effort.
The results of the Presidential Election, 
however, leave many of these victories in a 
tenuous situation.
The Obama administration gave a crucial 
green light in 2013 to allow Colorado and 
Washington, and other states thereafter, 
the flexibility to implement their legalization 
initiatives notwithstanding federal prohibition. 
Some had hoped that the new administration 
would be good on marijuana policy given 
Trump’s campaign statement that legalization 
“should be a state issue, state-by-state.” But 
that hope has been seriously diminished by 
his choice for attorney general—Senator Jeff 
Sessions, a drug war dinosaur with a long 
history of racist rhetoric and sympathies.The past year marked another breakthrough 
in our work on Capitol Hill to reform federal 
marijuana policy. We played an instrumental 
role in several successful legislative efforts, 
including the renewal of legislation cutting 
off funding for the DEA and other federal law 
enforcement agencies to interfere with state 
medical marijuana laws.
Support for drug policy reform is rising 
across the political spectrum. Medical 
marijuana amendments now routinely pass the 
Republican-controlled House and Republican-
controlled Senate Appropriations Committee; 
an amendment to end federal marijuana 
prohibition outright failed by just nine votes 
last year in the House.
Our offices in New Jersey, New Mexico and 
New York have launched what we expect will 
be multi-year campaigns to legalize marijuana 
through their legislatures, and we’ll be working 
closely with allies to support similar efforts in 
several more states.
We took our biggest steps ever in 2016—yet 
2017 could very well be the most significant 
year so far in our decades-long struggle to end 
marijuana prohibition.The Drug Policy Alliance  
and its lobbying arm, 
Drug Policy Action , 
played a key leadership 
role in the California 
campaign.7
Ending the drug war  & mass 
criminalization
Almost half a million people, disproportionately black and Latino, are locked 
up in U.S. prisons and jails today because of drug prohibition. 
It costs many billions of dollars annually to arrest 
and incarcerate them. As support for criminal 
justice reform grows dramatically, drug policy 
reform is at the cutting-edge of broader efforts 
to end mass criminalization and re-envision the 
criminal justice system. 
DPA has been at the forefront of many, 
perhaps most, major drug sentencing reforms 
over the past two decades. There are many 
tens of thousands fewer people behind 
bars today as a result of DPA’s efforts—and 
hundreds of thousands who either did not go 
to jail or prison, or who spent less time there, 
because of our work.
Our longstanding efforts to end civil asset 
forfeiture—the widespread police practice 
of seizing people’s property without even a 
conviction—paid off big time last year, as 
California and Florida reformed their civil asset 
forfeiture laws to protect people suspected 
of drug law violations from unjust property seizures. DPA played a pivotal role in both of 
these states’ efforts, working with allies from 
across the political spectrum.
Our focus is increasingly on reducing 
and ending criminal punishment for drug 
possession. We’ve invested substantial 
research to determine how to best move public 
opinion. We’re working with legislators, most 
notably in Maryland, to end the criminalization 
of drug possession. And where it’s still treated 
as a felony, as is the case in 32 states, we’re 
working to reduce it to a misdemeanor.

Introducing	DPA’s	office	of	academic	engagement
Just over a year ago, we launched our 
Office	of	Academic	Engagement	(OAE) 	
to more deeply engage researchers and 
academics in DPA’s work and the drug 
policy reform movement more broadly. DPA 
has a rich tradition of bringing together key 
thinkers from around the world to tackle the 
complex problems posed by drug policy. 
Building on that legacy, OAE supports 
scholars in doing advocacy, convenes 
experts	to	inform	the	field,	and	strengthens 	
DPA’s use of research in advancing its 
policy positions.In	its	first	year,	the	office	organized	two	
seminal events. New Strategies for Novel 
Psychoactive Substances , hosted at the 
New School for Social Research and the 
John Jay College of Criminal Justice, 
which laid the foundation for a series of 
recommendations for researchers, 
policymakers, medical and social service 
providers, and media. Black Faces White 
Lives: Race and Reparative Justice in the 
Era of a “Gentler War on Drugs” , hosted at 
Columbia University, presented a framework 
for reducing the harms associated with drug 
use as well as the harms wrought by our 
drug policies past and present. 
Building on its network of more than 
450 scholars, the OAE will continue to 
advance drug policies grounded in the best 
possible evidence.
10
During the 2016 presidential primaries, DPA 
conducted polls on decriminalization for the 
first time and the results were promising—with 
significant majorities of voters in New 
Hampshire, Maine and even South Carolina 
supporting an end to arrests for drug possession.
At the local level, we’re leading efforts to initiate 
and implement Law Enforcement Assisted 
Diversion (LEAD) programs in several cities 
across the country such as Ithaca, Los Angeles, 
Pueblo (CO), Santa Fe and San Francisco. 
This is a major step toward our ultimate goal of 
ending criminal penalties for drug possession. 
In Ithaca we went a step further and worked 
closely with the city’s mayor, Svante Myrick, 
to introduce a comprehensive municipal drug 
strategy that received significant national press. And nothing surprised us more than the 
outpouring of support when the DEA moved 
to prohibit kratom, a medicinal plant used for 
millennia in Southeast Asia that’s currently 
used by millions in the U.S. We mobilized to 
stop the DEA and were stunned at the nearly 
100,000 DPA supporters who contacted their 
Representatives. For the first time ever, the 
DEA at least temporarily backed off an effort 
to ban yet another substance.
With your support, more and more policymakers 
and elected officials are realizing that for the 
sake of our safety and health, it makes sense to 
reduce the role of criminalization in drug policy.With your support, more

11
Promoting health,  
reducing harm
DPA	is	leading	the	fight	to	reduce	the	death,	disease,	crime	and	suffering	
associated with both drug use and drug prohibition.  
This means supporting harm reduction 
interventions grounded in science, compassion, 
health and human rights. Throughout DPA’s 
history, one major focus has been reducing 
the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and 
other preventable diseases by making sterile 
syringes legally available. This paid off in a big 
way over the past two years, with Congress 
overturning the decades-long ban on federal 
funding for syringe access programs, and 
with states like Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and 
Maryland passing legislative reforms to initiate 
such programs. 
DPA took the lead over a decade ago in 
addressing the rapidly growing number of 
overdose deaths, which recently surpassed 
auto accidents as the leading cause of 
accidental death in the U.S. The past few 
years have been transformative for overdose 
prevention efforts in the U.S., and much of it 
can be credited to our efforts. In the last three years, more than two dozen 
states have passed legislation to increase 
access to naloxone and “911 Good Samaritan” 
laws to stop arresting and prosecuting people 
for drug possession when they call 911 to 
report an overdose. 
In 2016 we led efforts in New Mexico and 
Maine to pass life-saving overdose prevention 
legislation that improves access to the overdose 
antidote, naloxone, and we were even able to 
override Governor LePage’s veto in Maine. The past few years have 
been transformative for 
overdose prevention 
efforts	in	the	U.S.,	and	
much of it can be credited 
to	our	efforts.
12
Our work building support for the first supervised 
consumption facility in the U.S. is especially 
promising. These facilities are places where 
people who inject drugs can do so under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional and 
connect with life-saving services. There is 
overwhelming evidence from the nearly 100 
facilities operating in 68 cities worldwide that they 
drastically reduce new HIV infections, overdoses, 
and public nuisance without increasing drug use 
or criminal activity. They also provide enormous 
fiscal benefits to taxpayers. With your continued 
support, this life-saving strategy will be coming to 
the U.S. soon.
Between all the policy victories and the 
groundswell of press coverage, it’s clear that a 
nationwide movement to address the overdose 
crisis is finally emerging. It is now up to us to 
ensure the nation’s focus on overdose and the 
growing problems around opioids do not lead to a 
backlash, that well-intentioned bills do not contain 
bad provisions, that good policy is implemented 
in good faith, and that steady progress continues 
to be made across the country. 
Many thanks to you for making all of this 
possible. Your support is helping save lives 
every day, all over the country.

victories and the

Catalyzing international change
DPA’s international work is increasingly 
focused on advising foreign governments 
on their own drug policy reforms, as 
we continue to exert influence on U.S. 
involvement in global drug policy, provide 
leadership and coordination among U.S. 
groups, and contribute to the evolution of 
global drug policy through the media and 
strategic alliances.
When world leaders gathered in New York 
for	the	most	significant	international	drug	
policy meeting in almost two decades, the 
United Nations General Assembly Special 
Session	on	Drugs	(UNGASS),	DPA	amplified	
global calls for wholesale reform. We held 
events on race and the drug war and on 
the role of faith leaders in drug policy, and 
arranged for performers in prohibition-era 
attire to hand UN attendees copies of 
the Post-Prohibition Times , a newspaper 
printout of a letter to UN Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon urging him to set the stage “for 
real reform of global drug control policy.”
This public letter, initiated and led by DPA, 
included an unprecedented and impressive 
range of signatories from Senators 
Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders to former President Jimmy Carter, 
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 
businessmen	Warren	Buffett,	George	Soros 	
and Richard Branson, actors Michael 
Douglas and Jane Fonda, singers John 
Legend and Mary J. Blige, activists Reverend 
Jesse Jackson, Gloria Steinem and Michelle 
Alexander, as well as distinguished legislators, 
cabinet	ministers,	and	former	UN	officials.
With citizens across the world calling for 
reform, and with countries moving ahead with 
innovative drug policies, sooner or later the UN 
too	will	have	to	change	to	reflect	new	realities 	
on the ground, or risk becoming an irrelevant 
and ignored force in global drug policy. Thank 
you for helping make all of this possible.

Advocacy grants
DPA’s Advocacy Grants Program promotes policy change and advances drug policy reform 
at the local, state and national levels by strategically funding smaller, geographically limited 
or single-issue projects. Funded annually at a level of roughly $1.2 million, the program raises 
awareness and promotes policy change through two vehicles: the Promoting Policy Change 
Program and the Special Opportunities Program.
