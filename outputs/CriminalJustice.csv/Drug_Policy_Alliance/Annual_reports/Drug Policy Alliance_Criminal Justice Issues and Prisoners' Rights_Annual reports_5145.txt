The work described herein includes that of the Drug Policy 
Alliance, a 501 (c)(3) organization, and Drug Policy Action, a 501 (c)(4) organization. References to “DPA” refer to the work of both organizations.
We are the Drug Policy Alliance
1The Drug Policy Alliance envisions a 
just society in which drug policies are grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights. We fight to advance those laws and policies that best reduce the harms of both drug use and drug prohibition. We work to ensure that officials and the public respect and promote the inherent dignity of all individuals and their personal autonomy. 2Our Priorities
• Ending the role of criminalization in responding to personal 
drug use, so that people are no longer punished solely for 
what they put into their bodies, and removing a common 
excuse for over-policing, particularly of communities of color.
• Pushing back on the excessive punishment for drug offenses that has contributed to the U.S. incarceration crisis.
• Advocating for responsible and equitable legal regulation of marijuana to reduce and begin to repair the harms caused by 
prohibition. 
• Promoting health-centered drug policies by advocating for 
services such as access to treatment on demand, supervised 
consumption services, drug maintenance therapies, and 
syringe access programs.
• Empowering youth, parents and educators with honest, reality-based drug education that moves beyond inaccurate, 
fear-based messages and zero-tolerance policies.Our supporters are individuals who 
believe the war on drugs must end. Together we work to ensure that our nation’s drug policies no longer 
arrest, incarcerate, disenfranchise 
and otherwise harm millions—particularly young people and people of color who are disproportionately targeted by the war on drugs. 
 How We Work 
We engage in intensive policy 
advocacy at the federal, state and 
local levels across the country. We 
draft legislation and ballot initiatives, 
and our advocates and networks of 
funded partners collaborate to mobilize 
powerful coalitions in support of our 
priority campaigns. 
Through communications and public 
education efforts, we change public opinion, sometimes dramatically—as 
has happened with marijuana over the 
last decade. Our work is grounded 
in our deep legal and substantive 
expertise on criminal justice, health and 
marijuana policy. 3We have also been at the forefront 
of most of the major drug sentencing 
reforms over the past two decades, 
including the 2010 federal Fair 
Sentencing Act, which reduced the 
crack/powder sentencing disparity. 
As a result of our efforts, there are tens 
of thousands fewer people behind bars 
and hundreds of thousands who either 
did not go to jail or prison, or who spent less time there. And there’s no telling 
how many lives we have saved.Our Impact
Together, the Drug Policy Alliance and 
our political affiliate Drug Policy Action 
have transformed millions of lives. 
We are the only organization that 
has played a role in every successful 
marijuana legalization ballot initiative 
to date—Alaska, California, Colorado, 
Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, 
Washington and Washington, D.C.—and 
in the campaign that made Uruguay the first country to legalize adult use. 
Since our founding, DPA has been deeply 
involved in harm reduction and other 
overdose prevention efforts, playing 
a pivotal role in increasing access to 
naloxone, instituting 911 Good Samaritan 
laws, and establishing legal access to 
sterile syringes. The Drug Policy Alliance is entering a critical chapter in its 
history. With our transformative role in making marijuana 
legalization possible, we have changed the national 
conversation about the war on drugs and brought about a new 
world of opportunities for reform. The wind is in our sails, and 
now we need to move swiftly toward our ultimate goal: ending 
the war on drugs and its devastating harms.
In just the past year, we’ve made so much progress:
• DPA contributed to Michigan’s marijuana legalization victory, 
medical marijuana legalization in Missouri, and marijuana 
decriminalization in New Mexico. We secured automatic 
expungement of marijuana convictions in California. And we 
changed the conversation in D.C., with numerous presidential 
hopefuls using our talking points about ending marijuana 
prohibition and repairing the harms of criminalization.Letter from the President and Executive Director
Making the most of this moment
We have the momentum  
to end the drug war.• DPA drafted and introduced legislation in seven states 
to allow the establishment of life-saving supervised 
consumption services. These sites allow people to use pre-
obtained drugs without risk of arrest and in the presence of 
trained health professionals, who are available to reverse 
overdoses and connect them to services.
• DPA almost single-handedly blocked new efforts to establish harsher federal mandatory minimum sentences for a wide 
range of synthetic drugs.
• DPA developed the first-ever harm reduction drug education 
curriculum for high school students and piloted it in New York 
and San Francisco. 
We have changed drug laws in dozens of cities, states, and at the federal level, directly improving the quality of life for millions 
of people. DPA is forging a path to a future where fewer people 
are arrested and incarcerated for drug offenses, and where 
those who need help have access to vital health services.4The vast majority of Americans have 
long believed the drug war to be a 
failure, but now we’re finally seeing a 
palpable shift in the way these issues are 
discussed in mainstream politics. The 
overdose crisis, with its terrible human 
toll, is also sensitizing even more people 
to the need for policies that save lives and provide support, not punishment, 
to those who struggle with problematic 
drug use.
The challenge now is to build on this 
momentum with an ambitious and 
sophisticated agenda to take reform to 
the next level. That is our focus, and our 
commitment to you. 
DPA is developing innovative state-  
and municipal-level campaigns with the 
goal of ending the criminalization of personal drug use and offering non-
coercive health interventions when drug use is problematic. This is a long-
term proposition, but one that has the 
potential for dramatic impact: today, the 
possession of small amounts of drugs for 
personal use is the single most arrested 
offense in the United States, with 1.4 
million arrests a year. We intend to do 
for drug decriminalization what we did for marijuana legalization: bring it into 
mainstream discourse and turn it into 
effective policy.
We are doubling down on our efforts 
to counter the overdose crisis with a 
suite of policies that have been proven 
to save lives, instead of the empty 
rhetoric of so many U.S. leaders. We 
are fighting in D.C. to oppose the Department of Justice’s callous efforts 
to block the establishment of supervised 
consumption services pursuant to the 
anachronistic “crack house statute.” We 
are also leading the charge to expand 5The vast majority of

disorder, sterile syringes, and the 
overdose reversal medication, naloxone.
Despite the current administration’s 
attempts to weaponize the overdose 
crisis to stigmatize immigrants and other 
vulnerable groups, vast swaths of the 
public—in the U.S. and in countries around 
the globe—support ending the drug war 
policies that gave rise to this crisis.
When it comes to marijuana legalization, 
DPA is prioritizing legislative campaigns in states like New York and New Jersey 
that have some of the highest numbers 
of arrests in the country, as well as 
severe racial disparities in arrest rates.
Our goal is not just to add another state to 
the list of those with legal marijuana, but 
to maximize the real-world impact of those 
reforms. For the same reason, our ongoing 
state and federal marijuana legalization campaigns prioritize provisions to repair the harms of prohibition: automatic record 
clearing, reinvesting tax revenues in 
the communities that have suffered the 
most, and eliminating barriers to market 
access for small businesses in impacted 
communities. And we are spurring a 
debate within and beyond the marijuana industry about their own responsibility to 
ensure that legalization doesn’t compound 
or perpetuate the harms of prohibition. 
We are keenly aware, even as drug 
policy reform is progressing most rapidly 
in the West and Northeast, that the 
drug war rages on in dozens of states 
that have persistently high rates of 
criminalization and incarceration, with minimal access to harm reduction. That’s 
why, even as we push the envelope in 
some states, we are also increasingly 
investing in reform efforts throughout the 
South and Midwest, including in Florida, 6Of course, our agenda is 
ambitious. But we have 
a long history of winning 
meaningful reforms against long odds, and we are 
primed to seize these 
opportunities to build new drug policies grounded in 
science, compassion, 
health and human rights.Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri, where we will be 
hosting the 2019 International Drug Policy Reform Conference 
in November.
Internationally, we are increasingly focusing our efforts on 
shifting U.S. foreign policy. These strategies remain stuck in 
the 1980s, with billions of dollars going to international drug 
enforcement, only further strengthening organized crime and 
doing nothing to reduce the domestic availability or use of 
drugs. With Canada legalizing marijuana and Mexico opening a 
conversation about broader drug reform, our aim is to leverage international developments to increase pressure on the U.S. 
The accomplishments detailed in this report would have been 
unimaginable just a few years ago. Your support of DPA made 
this dramatic progress possible. 
Of course, our agenda is ambitious. But we have a long history 
of winning meaningful reforms against long odds, and we are primed to seize these opportunities to build new drug policies 
grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights.
The next chapter of our struggle begins with advocates like 
you. We can’t thank you enough for standing with us.

The war on drugs drives the 
overdose crisis
While the current administration 
continues to invest in the failed policies that fostered the current overdose crisis, DPA is leading the fight to reduce preventable deaths and disease  with a comprehensive set of harm reduction, treatment and decriminalization policies.If 50 years of the failed war on drugs has taught us anything, it 
is that prohibition does not work. Overdose claimed more than 
72,000 lives in 2017, making it the leading cause of accidental 
death in the United States.
Criminalization stigmatizes people who use drugs, forcing them 
underground and away from health services, information on safe 
usage, and drug treatment interventions. It also represents a 
staggering misallocation of funding and priorities, with the vast 
majority of resources invested in coercing and punishing people 
who use drugs, instead of helping them.
And because the supply of drugs is unregulated under 
prohibition, people are forced to use substances of unknown quality and purity, resulting in a deadly crisis that crosses racial 
and economic lines as it continues to ravage communities 
across the country. 
DPA is committed to reversing this cycle of failure.8We are the only policy advocacy 
organization with the expertise and 
national reach to effectively turn the 
tide on the overdose crisis. We played 
an instrumental role in the proliferation 
of 911 Good Samaritan laws and 
naloxone access laws, which have been 
implemented to varying degrees in nearly all 50 U.S. states over the past decade.  
We’re now leading the national charge to 
establish the first supervised consumption 
services (SCS) site in the U.S. Nobody has 
ever died in any of the scores of SCS sites 
currently operating around the world, 
while thousands have been saved from overdose, HIV and hepatitis transmission, 
and other blood-borne illnesses. 
DPA has drafted nearly every piece of 
state legislation in the country seeking 
to authorize SCS, including in California, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont. In California we built support in both houses of the legislature, 
and successfully passed the first state-level 
SCS authorization bill. While former Governor 
Jerry Brown ultimately vetoed our bill in 2018, 
current Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly 
criticized the veto and spoken of his support for SCS. We have also made significant 
progress on bringing SCS to New York City, 
garnering the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, 
who previously opposed SCS.
One of our main challenges is federal 
opposition to SCS. Last fall, Deputy Attorney 
General Rod Rosenstein threatened to 
prosecute anyone who opened an SCS 
under the “crack house statute.” Since then, the U.S. Attorney for eastern Pennsylvania 
filed a lawsuit to prevent Safehouse, 
an overdose prevention nonprofit, from 
opening an SCS in Philadelphia. DPA is 
working with Safehouse and other allies to 
respond to the lawsuit. 9DPA has drafted nearly 
every piece of state 
legislation in the country 
seeking to authorize SCS, 
including in California, 
Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New York 
and Vermont.  
10DPA is also working in D.C. to eliminate these obstacles. Last year, 
we worked closely with Senate Democrats behind the scenes to 
ensure that a potential federal funding ban on SCS was removed 
from an appropriations bill, a critical victory. Now, we need to go 
further and establish protections for SCS in the appropriations 
process, and secure a commitment from the Justice Department 
to end its persecution of groups trying to open such sites.
Shaping Federal Legislation
In the past year alone, DPA monitored more than 120 federal 
opioid and overdose bills, and successfully defeated some of 
the worst elements, such as penalty increases. At the same time, 
we fought to allow health organizations to use federal funds for 
naloxone; increase the number of patients to whom doctors can 
prescribe buprenorphine; improve access to methadone through 
Medicare; and mandate the DEA to permit doctors to offer 
medications for opioid use disorder through tele-health services. 
Increasing Access to Drug Checking
Drug checking kits and fentanyl test strips can save lives by helping people make informed decisions about what they put 
into their bodies. Unfortunately, these tools are frequently 
banned under state drug paraphernalia laws. DPA successfully legalized drug checking in Maryland and Washington, D.C., 
and created a pathway toward exemption for drug checking in 
California. In New Mexico, we led an effort that made it the first state to repeal criminal penalties for all drug paraphernalia.
Improving Access to Medications for Opioid Use 
Disorder 
People recently incarcerated are at 40 times greater risk of 
dying from an overdose. DPA continues to advance legislation 
in New Mexico and New York to give people in jails and prisons 
access to methadone and buprenorphine, considered the gold 
standard of opioid addiction treatment.
Working to Bring Cutting Edge Treatments to the U.S.
DPA is spearheading the effort to bring injectable opioid 
treatment, sometimes referred to as heroin-assisted treatment 
—which has been long proven successful internationally—to the 
United States. In the fall of 2018 in New York City, we hosted a 
landmark convening of globally renowned researchers to devel-
op a strategy for the U.S., and are now building the action plan.
With your support, DPA can continue its renowned leadership 
in promoting harm reduction solutions, advancing meaningful 
reforms that save lives and, ultimately, end the overdose crisis.What do you see as the unique value that DPA brings to 
your work? DPA has been ahead of the curve on so many 
issues—it’s often been a lone voice, quite strategic in bringing 
critical reforms from the margins to the mainstream. There’s no 
other organization connecting so many of the dots between 
mass criminalization and public health.
Why is it so significant that medications to treat opioid 
use disorder are now being offered in Rhode Island prisons and jails? 
People are at particularly grave risk for 
overdose immediately after they’re released from incarceration. 
But most prisons and jails force people to withdraw from 
medicated-assisted treatment when they enter the system, 
and most offer no medication upon release. I worked for 
over 15 years in Rhode Island to make medications to treat 
opioid use disorder available behind bars, and we finally were Interview : 
DPA Board Member Josiah Rich, MD
successful in 2016—we became the first state in the country 
to do this. Rhode Island now screens all incarcerated people 
for opioid use disorder and makes all three FDA-approved 
medications available to all those who need and want it. We’re 
reaching an extremely vulnerable population at an extremely 
vulnerable time with the best treatment available. This program 
decreased statewide post-release overdose deaths by 61%—
numbers like this are virtually unheard-of. Now other states, like Massachusetts and Maine, are beginning to follow suit.
From a public health perspective, why is decriminaliza -
tion important?  Punishment does not work to treat addiction. 
What treatment capacity we do have isn’t utilized effectively 
because of criminalization. A lot of people who want help are 
scared to ask for it, because of the punishment and coercion 
associated with criminalization.Josiah “Jody” Rich is a professor of medicine and 
community health at Brown University, who was elected 
to the National Academy of Medicine earlier this year.   
Ending marijuana prohibition 
and repairing its harms
DPA is at the forefront of the movement 
to end marijuana prohibition and is the only organization with roles in every successful legalization ballot initiative to date. 
Marijuana prohibition remains at the heart of the war on drugs. 
While states that have legalized have seen a steep decline 
in arrests, marijuana arrests remain near their all-time high 
nationally, at 659,700 in 2017. This demonstrates the urgent 
need to end prohibition in more states, particularly those that 
have the highest rates of arrest.
Our latest victories include the November 2018 election wins 
in Michigan, which became the 10th state to legalize marijuana 
for adult use, and Missouri, which became the 32nd state with 
a workable medical marijuana law. In another sign of progress, voters ousted Texas incumbent 
Pete Sessions from his U.S. House seat. As chair of the Rules 
Committee, Sessions single-handedly blocked Congress from 
holding any votes on marijuana reform for more than a year. His 
successor, Colin Allred, is a civil rights lawyer and supporter of 
medical marijuana and decriminalization. In addition, at least 12 
gubernatorial candidates who support marijuana legalization won their November 2018 elections, including two long-time DPA 
allies, Gavin Newsom (California) and Jared Polis (Colorado). 
The shift on marijuana in D.C. may best be measured by 
the number of presidential hopefuls that are coming out in 
support of marijuana legalization. They include Senators Cory 
Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and 
Elizabeth Warren; Governor Jay Inslee; former Governors John 
Hickenlooper and Bill Weld; Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro and Beto O’Rourke. The issue is also gaining increasing bipartisan 
support, with a majority of Republicans favoring legalization 
and Colorado Senator Cory Gardner securing a commitment 12from President Donald Trump to sign a 
legalization bill if it makes it to his desk.
The advances we made toward ending 
marijuana prohibition and repairing its harms also include:
Drafting and Influencing Federal 
Legislation
As the leading drug policy reform advo-
cate in D.C., DPA has made significant 
progress in fostering momentum for fed-
eral marijuana legalization. We drafted 
and have secured widespread support 
for the Marijuana Justice Act, which 
would legalize marijuana and include 
provisions to repair prohibition’s harms. And we have played a key role in secur-
ing continuation of the Rohrabacher- 
Blumenauer Amendment, which protects 
states with legal medical marijuana from 
federal interference.We also worked closely with members of the Senate on the STATES Act, a bipartisan effort to affirm the rights of 
states to determine their own marijuana 
laws; the RESPECT Act, aimed at 
promoting racial and gender diversity in 
the marijuana industry; and Sen. Chuck 
Schumer’s bill to effectively decriminalize 
marijuana at the federal level.
In addition, we supported budget 
amendments to prevent the Veterans Administration from punishing doctors 
who recommend medical marijuana to 
patients and to stop the Treasury from 
punishing banks that do business with 
legal marijuana companies.
Implementing Prop. 64 Reforms in 
California
Since legalizing marijuana in California, 
one of DPA’s most urgent priorities 
has been ensuring the expungement of marijuana convictions from criminal 
records. In September 2018, we 
succeeded when Governor Jerry 
Brown signed into law a DPA-supported 
bill creating a process for automatic 
expungement throughout the state, a 
critical step forward.
Prop. 64 set a new bar for marijuana 
legalization, with a wide range of 
restorative justice provisions. We’re now building on this work as we lead 
campaigns for marijuana legalization in 
New York, New Jersey and New Mexico. 
We’re gaining momentum for thoughtful 
legalization models that not only end 
marijuana prohibition, but begin to repair 
the drug war’s harms through community reinvestment and fair access to the new 
legal marijuana market.13Ensuring the promise of Proposition 64
14In addition to legalizing marijuana use for those 21 and over, 
Prop. 64 was the first legalization initiative to designate that 
those with convictions for certain marijuana offenses prior 
to the change in law—estimated to be in the hundreds of 
thousands—would have their records expunged of those 
charges. Such convictions can follow individuals for the rest 
of their lives, preventing access to education, employment, 
housing and social services. 
“Everyone has the right to lead a healthy, normal life, despite 
their criminal record history,” Rodney recently stated. 
Even after Prop. 64 was signed into law in November 2016, 
less than 10% of eligible Californians applied for record expungement. “The burden was placed on the individual,” he 
explained. “Parole officers and judges wouldn’t tell people. And 
even for those that were aware, the process was very difficult 
to navigate and very expensive. The system was essentially 
stacked against people of color and those with limited incomes.” 
With an eye on reversing the harms of marijuana prohibition, 
Rodney worked directly with lawmakers to draft legislation to As a staff attorney for DPA, 
Rodney Holcombe focuses on implementing aspects of Prop. 64, the historic ballot initiative that legalized marijuana in California. 
15automate record expungement, and 
organized free expungement clinics to 
help serve those impacted in the interim.  
“I visited communities all over the state 
and met so many people just looking 
for a path forward,” he recalled. “The 
clinics brought out way more people 
than we could help and at times it was overwhelming. I spent many long nights 
answering requests and helping to guide 
people through the process. But knowing 
that there were more people out there 
who looked like me, unable to find work 
or a place to live because of their record, 
that’s what kept me going.” 
Clinic participants came from all walks of 
life, from college students to day laborers 
trying to support their families to senior 
citizens still hopeful for a new beginning. 
In addition to pro-bono legal services, 
the clinics also provided wrap-around services that most often elude those 
carrying records, including information 
on accessing healthcare, immigration 
consultation and voter registration. 
“People were so excited to see food at 
the clinics. They were coming to us for 
much more than just legal advice.”
Rodney has kept in touch with some of 
the individuals he worked with directly. 
“I’ve heard from a few that they were finally able to get jobs and even vote for 
the first time.” 
In September 2018, Governor Jerry 
Brown signed the auto-expungement 
bill into law and the implementation has 
finally begun. 
“It’s a step forward, but the tremendous 
need reflects a larger humanitarian 
crisis around how we as a society deal 
with people with convictions,” Rodney 
explained. “The ability to clear one’s record can mean the difference between having housing and being homeless; 
having access to food and being hungry; 
living in poverty and being gainfully 
employed.” 
“Policy is an incremental process; we 
need to identify ways to address the 
larger, systemic issues,” he continued. “We need to keep going. This kind of 
reform is way overdue, but it needs to 
be made simple and accessible to truly 
serve those most harmed.” 
“When California is a free and accepting 
place that does not continue to punish 
people over and over for their past. And a place where people are no longer 
forever burdened by their mistakes, or 
things that should never have been a 
crime in the first place. That’s when we 
know the work is done.”16
Shifting away from a criminal justice approach  
to drug policy
Drug possession is the single most arrested offense in the 
U.S. In 2017, law enforcement made more than 1.63 million 
drug arrests, of which 85 percent (1.4 million) were for simple 
possession. Black people are more than two-and-a-half times 
as likely as white people to be arrested for possession for per -
sonal use, despite similar rates of use. Arrest does nothing to help those who may be struggling with problematic drug use. 
Meanwhile, those convicted then face the risk of incarcera -
tion, as well as tremendous barriers to finding jobs, housing, 
education and even voting.A significant piece of our work over the past year has focused on developing workable policy concepts to end this disastrous 
cycle of drug criminalization.
In November 2018, in partnership with the Open Society 
Foundations, DPA convened a group of 34 policy and legal 
experts from the U.S. and 16 other countries including 
Australia, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Ghana and 
Ireland. Each of these experts shared their experiences in 
implementing various decriminalization models and attempting to advance decriminalization in their home countries. With this 
new coalition, DPA is developing guidelines for how smart and 
effective decriminalization could be implemented at the local, 
state and national levels in the U.S.16DPA is leading the charge to 
decriminalize the possession of drugs for personal useBased on our findings so far, we believe 
an ideal drug decriminalization measure 
would seek to accomplish the following:
• Eliminate criminal penalties for drug 
use, possession for personal use, and 
possession of paraphernalia.
• Eliminate punitive, abstinence-based or 
coercive approaches to drug treatment.
• Avoid “net-widening” such as fines and fees that result in poor people being 
criminalized.
• Avoid loopholes through which law 
enforcement could seek to criminalize 
the same people (disturbing the peace, 
public nuisance ordinances, etc.).
• Include a criminal record expungement and resentencing component. 
• Expand harm reduction information and healthcare access for people who need it by reinvesting the money saved from 
law enforcement and incarceration.
• Increase access to wraparound 
services such as housing support, 
which are critical to people who are 
struggling with problematic drug use. 
DPA is exploring potential 
decriminalization ballot initiative 
campaigns for 2020 in various states. 
California, Oregon and Washington—all 
of which were leaders in marijuana 
legalization—show the greatest promise. 
We are also examining the potential for legislative campaigns in states worst 
impacted by the overdose crisis, though 
these will move more slowly.
Meanwhile, we have continued to 
press for reforms that pave the way 
for decriminalization. Given that 30 
states still punish drug possession (excluding marijuana) as a felony, this 
work includes our efforts to “de-felonize” 
drug possession in numerous states, 
as California, Oklahoma, Oregon and Connecticut have done in recent years. 
It also includes our ongoing work at the 
local level to initiate and implement Law 
Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) 
programs—which, instead of arresting 
people for drug use, diverts them to other 
services and supports—in numerous cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, 
Ithaca, Denver, Santa Fe and San 
Francisco. LEAD is the closest thing so far 
to decriminalization in the U.S.  
Fighting back against harsh penalties 
for drug offenses
A critical part of our work remains 
reforming and fighting back against 
overly harsh policies, including recent 
federal bills seeking to increase 
1718sentences for opioid-related offenses. 
In a crucial victory last year, DPA played 
a leading role in stopping the passage 
of SITSA, a sweeping bill that would 
have given the DEA and Justice Dept. 
free reign to criminalize more drugs 
and create new draconian sentencing 
policies, without any oversight. We expect similar proposals to emerge this 
year, in response to fentanyl in particular.
We’re also pushing back on “drug-induced 
homicide” laws, which prosecutors are increasingly using to charge people 
with murder or manslaughter for 
selling or sharing drugs that result in a 
death. We were successful in helping 
block new such laws in over a dozen 
states, including New York, Illinois, 
Massachusetts and Maryland last year.At the same time, we played an instrumen-tal role in ensuring that the federal First 
Step Act, signed into law in December,  
included drug sentencing reform provi-sions and did not merely tinker around 
the edges of the issue. While this bill has 
significant weaknesses and was a tough 
compromise for us, it has the potential to lead to the release of thousands of people 
serving disproportionately long sentences 
for drug law violations.
DPA also helped obtain a significant win 
in the U.S. Supreme Court in Indiana v. 
Timbs, establishing new limits on police 
departments’ ability to seize personal assets without due process.
With your support, we are working to 
transform the way this country responds to 
drug use, by ending the criminalization of 
millions and restoring hope and promise to 
hundreds of thousands of individuals.Arrest does nothing to 
help those who may be 
struggling with problematic 
drug use. Meanwhile, those convicted then face the risk 
of incarceration, as well 
as tremendous barriers to finding jobs, housing, 
education and even voting.Over three intensive days, participants learned firsthand about 
Portugal’s decriminalization model from government officials, 
local activists, medical professionals and law enforcement, 
as well as current and former drug users, who shared their 
experiences with the system. 
Partners learned about the model—which emphasizes the 
improvement of health and public safety outcomes over 
punishment—and the positive outcomes it has yielded, 
including more people opting to receive treatment and drastic 
declines in HIV/AIDS and drug overdose rates. 
DPA developed a briefing paper and companion video on the 
benefits of the Portugal model to encourage further discus -
sion on what a health-focused decriminalization model could 
look like in the U.S. • Learn more at drugpolicy.org/portugalLessons learned : 
DPA partner gathering in Portugal
In March 2018, DPA hosted our annual gathering of our funded partners 
(grantees) in Lisbon, Portugal. These groups represented more than 30 
community-based and advocacy organizations from across the U.S.
“I visited Portugal as part of a delegation of advocates 
led by the Drug Policy Alliance…As I met with public 
health officials, visited treatment facilities, and heard 
from law enforcement agents, as well as current 
and former drug users, what struck me most was 
the humanity of this approach. The focus is on 
supporting people and their health.” 
—Susan Burton, Founder and Executive Director of A New 
    Way of Life Reentry Project and DPA Funded PartnerEnding the global drug war , starting at home
For decades, the United 
States has poured billions of dollars into fighting a global war on drugs in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Afghanistan and the Philippines. 20In the name of cutting off the supply of 
drugs, the U.S. has financed militaries 
and police around the world, shaped 
their criminal justice and drug laws, 
provided equipment and supplies, and 
even directly intervened on the ground. 
More recently, the administration of 
President Donald Trump has attempted to build a wall on the southern border of 
the U.S. and further restrict immigration, 
in part in the name of blocking the entry 
of drugs. 
These efforts have been a spectacular 
and expensive failure. Neither supply 
nor demand have meaningfully decreased throughout the U.S.-led 
drug war. Instead, the drug war has 
contributed to a dramatic escalation of 
violence and corruption in the countries 
targeted.
 DPA has worked on global drug 
policy reform for years, including our 
successful efforts to legalize marijuana 
in Uruguay—the first country to do so. 
We are continuing this work, helping to 
advocate for cutting-edge reforms like 
all-drug decriminalization abroad, and 
bringing lessons to the U.S. from other countries, like Portugal. 
We are increasingly focusing our 
international work on the United States’ 
foreign policy concerning drugs—an 
area on which few, if any, organizations 
focus systematically, and where we 
have tremendous value added. We 
have started to closely examine U.S. 
appropriations to countries like the Philippines, where the U.S. is supporting 
a police force that has been implicated 
in thousands of extrajudicial killings 
of people alleged to use or sell drugs. 
We are working with allies in Mexico 21to shape the drug war debate there, including by supporting their efforts 
to legalize marijuana, and educating 
U.S. lawmakers about the harms of the 
current approach. And we are calling 
out the administration on the deep flaws 
in its narrative about immigrants and 
drug trafficking.
As we deepen this work, we intend to 
develop a comprehensive assessment of the waste and devastation caused by 
U.S. global drug policies, so that reform 
at home also translates into reform 
abroad.Special Opportunities Program

Voices Of Community Activists & Leaders 
(VOCAL-NY) is a grassroots membership organization that builds power among low-income people affected by HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, the drug war, homelessness, and mass incarceration. VOCAL-NY has been a DPA funded partner since 2006. Through the Promoting Policy Change and Special Opportunities Grants programs, DPA has provided more than $550,000 to date in support of the organization’s vital community organizing, direct action, and leadership development work. 
Our relationship with VOCAL-NY goes far 
deeper than fiscal support. DPA’s partners are essential allies in advancing the drug policy reform movement on the grassroots level. 
Jeremy Saunders, Co-Executive Director of 
VOCAL-NY, provides additional insight into the powerful alliance between his organization and DPA’s New York State Office.Our history as campaign partners
Beyond the grant program, VOCAL-NY and DPA have been working together for nearly a 
decade. Our first joint campaign was getting 
the Good Samaritan Act passed in New York in 2011. This life-saving legislation allows people to call 911 if they experience or witness an overdose without fear of arrest or criminal prosecution for possessing small quantities 
of drugs or alcohol. Since that winning 
campaign, we have gone on to partner on many more victories that save and improve the lives of drug users throughout the state. 
Bringing the strength of grassroots 
mobilization to DPA’s work
DPA also contracts with VOCAL-NY as a con-sultant when the political climate in New York presents us with special opportunities to win. Our expertise lies in the grassroots. For 20 
years, we have been mobilizing marginalized 
New Yorkers impacted by the war on drugs, developing their leadership, and uplifting their voices to change the narrative for both legis-lators and the general public. Most recently, we worked with DPA to help organize low-in-come New Yorkers who have been impacted 
or criminalized by drug use in Western New 
York, as well as in Los Angeles. 
Significant victories & more to come
Legislative accomplishments achieved through this partnership start with the 2011 Good 
Samaritan Law, and have continued with 
expanding access to naloxone, passing the Compassionate Care Act to establish medical marijuana in New York State, decriminalizing syringes, and pushing the NYPD to reduce 
marijuana arrests by 90% in New York City.  
But the work is not done! Right now, our orga-
nizations are looking to establish Overdose Prevention Centers and push for medications 
for opioid use disorder in prisons and jails. 
The road is long, but we look forward to con-tinuing this important journey with DPA.Andrew Tobias

*The Drug Policy Alliance, a 501c3 organization, works closely with 
Drug Policy Action, a 501c4 affiliate organization, especially on ballot 
initiative campaigns. In some years, Drug Policy Action has raised more 
money than the Drug Policy Alliance, and has loaned funds to the Drug 
Policy Alliance to cover 501c3 expenses. This year, the loan shows up 
in the Drug Policy Alliance’s Statement of Financial Position as a $5.16

The work described herein includes that of the Drug Policy 
Alliance, a 501 (c)(3) organization, and Drug Policy Action, a 501 (c)(4) organization. References to “DPA” refer to the work of both organizations.
We are the Drug Policy Alliance
1The Drug Policy Alliance envisions a 
just society in which drug policies are grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights. We fight to advance those laws and policies that best reduce the harms of both drug use and drug prohibition. We work to ensure that officials and the public respect and promote the inherent dignity of all individuals and their personal autonomy. 2Our Priorities
• Ending the role of criminalization in responding to personal 
drug use, so that people are no longer punished solely for 
what they put into their bodies, and removing a common 
excuse for over-policing, particularly of communities of color.
• Pushing back on the excessive punishment for drug offenses that has contributed to the U.S. incarceration crisis.
• Advocating for responsible and equitable legal regulation of marijuana to reduce and begin to repair the harms caused by 
prohibition. 
• Promoting health-centered drug policies by advocating for 
services such as access to treatment on demand, supervised 
consumption services, drug maintenance therapies, and 
syringe access programs.
• Empowering youth, parents and educators with honest, reality-based drug education that moves beyond inaccurate, 
fear-based messages and zero-tolerance policies.Our supporters are individuals who 
believe the war on drugs must end. Together we work to ensure that our nation’s drug policies no longer 
arrest, incarcerate, disenfranchise 
and otherwise harm millions—particularly young people and people of color who are disproportionately targeted by the war on drugs. 
 How We Work 
We engage in intensive policy 
advocacy at the federal, state and 
local levels across the country. We 
draft legislation and ballot initiatives, 
and our advocates and networks of 
funded partners collaborate to mobilize 
powerful coalitions in support of our 
priority campaigns. 
Through communications and public 
education efforts, we change public opinion, sometimes dramatically—as 
has happened with marijuana over the 
last decade. Our work is grounded 
in our deep legal and substantive 
expertise on criminal justice, health and 
marijuana policy. 3We have also been at the forefront 
of most of the major drug sentencing 
reforms over the past two decades, 
including the 2010 federal Fair 
Sentencing Act, which reduced the 
crack/powder sentencing disparity. 
As a result of our efforts, there are tens 
of thousands fewer people behind bars 
and hundreds of thousands who either 
did not go to jail or prison, or who spent less time there. And there’s no telling 
how many lives we have saved.Our Impact
Together, the Drug Policy Alliance and 
our political affiliate Drug Policy Action 
have transformed millions of lives. 
We are the only organization that 
has played a role in every successful 
marijuana legalization ballot initiative 
to date—Alaska, California, Colorado, 
Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, 
Washington and Washington, D.C.—and 
in the campaign that made Uruguay the first country to legalize adult use. 
Since our founding, DPA has been deeply 
involved in harm reduction and other 
overdose prevention efforts, playing 
a pivotal role in increasing access to 
naloxone, instituting 911 Good Samaritan 
laws, and establishing legal access to 
sterile syringes. The Drug Policy Alliance is entering a critical chapter in its 
history. With our transformative role in making marijuana 
legalization possible, we have changed the national 
conversation about the war on drugs and brought about a new 
world of opportunities for reform. The wind is in our sails, and 
now we need to move swiftly toward our ultimate goal: ending 
the war on drugs and its devastating harms.
In just the past year, we’ve made so much progress:
• DPA contributed to Michigan’s marijuana legalization victory, 
medical marijuana legalization in Missouri, and marijuana 
decriminalization in New Mexico. We secured automatic 
expungement of marijuana convictions in California. And we 
changed the conversation in D.C., with numerous presidential 
hopefuls using our talking points about ending marijuana 
prohibition and repairing the harms of criminalization.Letter from the President and Executive Director
Making the most of this moment
We have the momentum  
to end the drug war.• DPA drafted and introduced legislation in seven states 
to allow the establishment of life-saving supervised 
consumption services. These sites allow people to use pre-
obtained drugs without risk of arrest and in the presence of 
trained health professionals, who are available to reverse 
overdoses and connect them to services.
• DPA almost single-handedly blocked new efforts to establish harsher federal mandatory minimum sentences for a wide 
range of synthetic drugs.
• DPA developed the first-ever harm reduction drug education 
curriculum for high school students and piloted it in New York 
and San Francisco. 
We have changed drug laws in dozens of cities, states, and at the federal level, directly improving the quality of life for millions 
of people. DPA is forging a path to a future where fewer people 
are arrested and incarcerated for drug offenses, and where 
those who need help have access to vital health services.4The vast majority of Americans have 
long believed the drug war to be a 
failure, but now we’re finally seeing a 
palpable shift in the way these issues are 
discussed in mainstream politics. The 
overdose crisis, with its terrible human 
toll, is also sensitizing even more people 
to the need for policies that save lives and provide support, not punishment, 
to those who struggle with problematic 
drug use.
The challenge now is to build on this 
momentum with an ambitious and 
sophisticated agenda to take reform to 
the next level. That is our focus, and our 
commitment to you. 
DPA is developing innovative state-  
and municipal-level campaigns with the 
goal of ending the criminalization of personal drug use and offering non-
coercive health interventions when drug use is problematic. This is a long-
term proposition, but one that has the 
potential for dramatic impact: today, the 
possession of small amounts of drugs for 
personal use is the single most arrested 
offense in the United States, with 1.4 
million arrests a year. We intend to do 
for drug decriminalization what we did for marijuana legalization: bring it into 
mainstream discourse and turn it into 
effective policy.
We are doubling down on our efforts 
to counter the overdose crisis with a 
suite of policies that have been proven 
to save lives, instead of the empty 
rhetoric of so many U.S. leaders. We 
are fighting in D.C. to oppose the Department of Justice’s callous efforts 
to block the establishment of supervised 
consumption services pursuant to the 
anachronistic “crack house statute.” We 
are also leading the charge to expand 5The vast majority of

overdose crisis, with its

to the need for policies 
that save lives and provide 
support, not punishment, 
to those who struggle with 
problematic drug use.access to medications for opioid use 
disorder, sterile syringes, and the 
overdose reversal medication, naloxone.
Despite the current administration’s 
attempts to weaponize the overdose 
crisis to stigmatize immigrants and other 
vulnerable groups, vast swaths of the 
public—in the U.S. and in countries around 
the globe—support ending the drug war 
policies that gave rise to this crisis.
When it comes to marijuana legalization, 
DPA is prioritizing legislative campaigns in states like New York and New Jersey 
that have some of the highest numbers 
of arrests in the country, as well as 
severe racial disparities in arrest rates.
Our goal is not just to add another state to 
the list of those with legal marijuana, but 
to maximize the real-world impact of those 
reforms. For the same reason, our ongoing 
state and federal marijuana legalization campaigns prioritize provisions to repair the harms of prohibition: automatic record 
clearing, reinvesting tax revenues in 
the communities that have suffered the 
most, and eliminating barriers to market 
access for small businesses in impacted 
communities. And we are spurring a 
debate within and beyond the marijuana industry about their own responsibility to 
ensure that legalization doesn’t compound 
or perpetuate the harms of prohibition. 
We are keenly aware, even as drug 
policy reform is progressing most rapidly 
in the West and Northeast, that the 
drug war rages on in dozens of states 
that have persistently high rates of 
criminalization and incarceration, with minimal access to harm reduction. That’s 
why, even as we push the envelope in 
some states, we are also increasingly 
investing in reform efforts throughout the 
South and Midwest, including in Florida, 6Of course, our agenda is 
ambitious. But we have 
a long history of winning 
meaningful reforms against long odds, and we are 
primed to seize these 
opportunities to build new drug policies grounded in 
science, compassion, 
health and human rights.Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri, where we will be 
hosting the 2019 International Drug Policy Reform Conference 
in November.
Internationally, we are increasingly focusing our efforts on 
shifting U.S. foreign policy. These strategies remain stuck in 
the 1980s, with billions of dollars going to international drug 
enforcement, only further strengthening organized crime and 
doing nothing to reduce the domestic availability or use of 
drugs. With Canada legalizing marijuana and Mexico opening a 
conversation about broader drug reform, our aim is to leverage international developments to increase pressure on the U.S. 
The accomplishments detailed in this report would have been 
unimaginable just a few years ago. Your support of DPA made 
this dramatic progress possible. 
Of course, our agenda is ambitious. But we have a long history 
of winning meaningful reforms against long odds, and we are primed to seize these opportunities to build new drug policies 
grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights.
The next chapter of our struggle begins with advocates like 
you. We can’t thank you enough for standing with us.

The war on drugs drives the 
overdose crisis
While the current administration 
continues to invest in the failed policies that fostered the current overdose crisis, DPA is leading the fight to reduce preventable deaths and disease  with a comprehensive set of harm reduction, treatment and decriminalization policies.If 50 years of the failed war on drugs has taught us anything, it 
is that prohibition does not work. Overdose claimed more than 
72,000 lives in 2017, making it the leading cause of accidental 
death in the United States.
Criminalization stigmatizes people who use drugs, forcing them 
underground and away from health services, information on safe 
usage, and drug treatment interventions. It also represents a 
staggering misallocation of funding and priorities, with the vast 
majority of resources invested in coercing and punishing people 
who use drugs, instead of helping them.
And because the supply of drugs is unregulated under 
prohibition, people are forced to use substances of unknown quality and purity, resulting in a deadly crisis that crosses racial 
and economic lines as it continues to ravage communities 
across the country. 
DPA is committed to reversing this cycle of failure.8We are the only policy advocacy 
organization with the expertise and 
national reach to effectively turn the 
tide on the overdose crisis. We played 
an instrumental role in the proliferation 
of 911 Good Samaritan laws and 
naloxone access laws, which have been 
implemented to varying degrees in nearly all 50 U.S. states over the past decade.  
We’re now leading the national charge to 
establish the first supervised consumption 
services (SCS) site in the U.S. Nobody has 
ever died in any of the scores of SCS sites 
currently operating around the world, 
while thousands have been saved from overdose, HIV and hepatitis transmission, 
and other blood-borne illnesses. 
DPA has drafted nearly every piece of 
state legislation in the country seeking 
to authorize SCS, including in California, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont. In California we built support in both houses of the legislature, 
and successfully passed the first state-level 
SCS authorization bill. While former Governor 
Jerry Brown ultimately vetoed our bill in 2018, 
current Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly 
criticized the veto and spoken of his support for SCS. We have also made significant 
progress on bringing SCS to New York City, 
garnering the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, 
who previously opposed SCS.
One of our main challenges is federal 
opposition to SCS. Last fall, Deputy Attorney 
General Rod Rosenstein threatened to 
prosecute anyone who opened an SCS 
under the “crack house statute.” Since then, the U.S. Attorney for eastern Pennsylvania 
filed a lawsuit to prevent Safehouse, 
an overdose prevention nonprofit, from 
opening an SCS in Philadelphia. DPA is 
working with Safehouse and other allies to 
respond to the lawsuit. 9DPA has drafted nearly 
every piece of state 
legislation in the country 
seeking to authorize SCS, 
including in California, 
Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New York 
and Vermont.  
10DPA is also working in D.C. to eliminate these obstacles. Last year, 
we worked closely with Senate Democrats behind the scenes to 
ensure that a potential federal funding ban on SCS was removed 
from an appropriations bill, a critical victory. Now, we need to go 
further and establish protections for SCS in the appropriations 
process, and secure a commitment from the Justice Department 
to end its persecution of groups trying to open such sites.
Shaping Federal Legislation
In the past year alone, DPA monitored more than 120 federal 
opioid and overdose bills, and successfully defeated some of 
the worst elements, such as penalty increases. At the same time, 
we fought to allow health organizations to use federal funds for 
naloxone; increase the number of patients to whom doctors can 
prescribe buprenorphine; improve access to methadone through 
Medicare; and mandate the DEA to permit doctors to offer 
medications for opioid use disorder through tele-health services. 
Increasing Access to Drug Checking
Drug checking kits and fentanyl test strips can save lives by helping people make informed decisions about what they put 
into their bodies. Unfortunately, these tools are frequently 
banned under state drug paraphernalia laws. DPA successfully legalized drug checking in Maryland and Washington, D.C., 
and created a pathway toward exemption for drug checking in 
California. In New Mexico, we led an effort that made it the first state to repeal criminal penalties for all drug paraphernalia.
Improving Access to Medications for Opioid Use 
Disorder 
People recently incarcerated are at 40 times greater risk of 
dying from an overdose. DPA continues to advance legislation 
in New Mexico and New York to give people in jails and prisons 
access to methadone and buprenorphine, considered the gold 
standard of opioid addiction treatment.
Working to Bring Cutting Edge Treatments to the U.S.
DPA is spearheading the effort to bring injectable opioid 
treatment, sometimes referred to as heroin-assisted treatment 
—which has been long proven successful internationally—to the 
United States. In the fall of 2018 in New York City, we hosted a 
landmark convening of globally renowned researchers to devel-
op a strategy for the U.S., and are now building the action plan.
With your support, DPA can continue its renowned leadership 
in promoting harm reduction solutions, advancing meaningful 
reforms that save lives and, ultimately, end the overdose crisis.What do you see as the unique value that DPA brings to 
your work? DPA has been ahead of the curve on so many 
issues—it’s often been a lone voice, quite strategic in bringing 
critical reforms from the margins to the mainstream. There’s no 
other organization connecting so many of the dots between 
mass criminalization and public health.
Why is it so significant that medications to treat opioid 
use disorder are now being offered in Rhode Island prisons and jails? 
People are at particularly grave risk for 
overdose immediately after they’re released from incarceration. 
But most prisons and jails force people to withdraw from 
medicated-assisted treatment when they enter the system, 
and most offer no medication upon release. I worked for 
over 15 years in Rhode Island to make medications to treat 
opioid use disorder available behind bars, and we finally were Interview :

to do this. Rhode Island now screens all incarcerated people 
for opioid use disorder and makes all three FDA-approved 
medications available to all those who need and want it. We’re 
reaching an extremely vulnerable population at an extremely 
vulnerable time with the best treatment available. This program 
decreased statewide post-release overdose deaths by 61%—
numbers like this are virtually unheard-of. Now other states, like Massachusetts and Maine, are beginning to follow suit.
From a public health perspective, why is decriminaliza -
tion important?  Punishment does not work to treat addiction. 
What treatment capacity we do have isn’t utilized effectively 
because of criminalization. A lot of people who want help are 
scared to ask for it, because of the punishment and coercion 
associated with criminalization.Josiah “Jody” Rich is a professor of medicine and 
community health at Brown University, who was elected 
to the National Academy of Medicine earlier this year.   
Ending marijuana prohibition 
and repairing its harms
DPA is at the forefront of the movement 
to end marijuana prohibition and is the only organization with roles in every successful legalization ballot initiative to date. 
Marijuana prohibition remains at the heart of the war on drugs. 
While states that have legalized have seen a steep decline 
in arrests, marijuana arrests remain near their all-time high 
nationally, at 659,700 in 2017. This demonstrates the urgent 
need to end prohibition in more states, particularly those that 
have the highest rates of arrest.
Our latest victories include the November 2018 election wins 
in Michigan, which became the 10th state to legalize marijuana 
for adult use, and Missouri, which became the 32nd state with 
a workable medical marijuana law. In another sign of progress, voters ousted Texas incumbent 
Pete Sessions from his U.S. House seat. As chair of the Rules 
Committee, Sessions single-handedly blocked Congress from 
holding any votes on marijuana reform for more than a year. His 
successor, Colin Allred, is a civil rights lawyer and supporter of 
medical marijuana and decriminalization. In addition, at least 12 
gubernatorial candidates who support marijuana legalization won their November 2018 elections, including two long-time DPA 
allies, Gavin Newsom (California) and Jared Polis (Colorado). 
The shift on marijuana in D.C. may best be measured by 
the number of presidential hopefuls that are coming out in 
support of marijuana legalization. They include Senators Cory 
Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and 
Elizabeth Warren; Governor Jay Inslee; former Governors John 
Hickenlooper and Bill Weld; Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro and Beto O’Rourke. The issue is also gaining increasing bipartisan 
support, with a majority of Republicans favoring legalization 
and Colorado Senator Cory Gardner securing a commitment 12from President Donald Trump to sign a 
legalization bill if it makes it to his desk.
The advances we made toward ending 
marijuana prohibition and repairing its harms also include:
Drafting and Influencing Federal 
Legislation
As the leading drug policy reform advo-
cate in D.C., DPA has made significant 
progress in fostering momentum for fed-
eral marijuana legalization. We drafted 
and have secured widespread support 
for the Marijuana Justice Act, which 
would legalize marijuana and include 
provisions to repair prohibition’s harms. And we have played a key role in secur-
ing continuation of the Rohrabacher- 
Blumenauer Amendment, which protects 
states with legal medical marijuana from 
federal interference.We also worked closely with members of the Senate on the STATES Act, a bipartisan effort to affirm the rights of 
states to determine their own marijuana 
laws; the RESPECT Act, aimed at 
promoting racial and gender diversity in 
the marijuana industry; and Sen. Chuck 
Schumer’s bill to effectively decriminalize 
marijuana at the federal level.
In addition, we supported budget 
amendments to prevent the Veterans Administration from punishing doctors 
who recommend medical marijuana to 
patients and to stop the Treasury from 
punishing banks that do business with 
legal marijuana companies.
Implementing Prop. 64 Reforms in 
California
Since legalizing marijuana in California, 
one of DPA’s most urgent priorities 
has been ensuring the expungement of marijuana convictions from criminal 
records. In September 2018, we 
succeeded when Governor Jerry 
Brown signed into law a DPA-supported 
bill creating a process for automatic 
expungement throughout the state, a 
critical step forward.
Prop. 64 set a new bar for marijuana 
legalization, with a wide range of 
restorative justice provisions. We’re now building on this work as we lead 
campaigns for marijuana legalization in 
New York, New Jersey and New Mexico. 
We’re gaining momentum for thoughtful 
legalization models that not only end 
marijuana prohibition, but begin to repair 
the drug war’s harms through community reinvestment and fair access to the new 
legal marijuana market.13Ensuring the promise of Proposition 64
14In addition to legalizing marijuana use for those 21 and over, 
Prop. 64 was the first legalization initiative to designate that 
those with convictions for certain marijuana offenses prior 
to the change in law—estimated to be in the hundreds of 
thousands—would have their records expunged of those 
charges. Such convictions can follow individuals for the rest 
of their lives, preventing access to education, employment, 
housing and social services. 
“Everyone has the right to lead a healthy, normal life, despite 
their criminal record history,” Rodney recently stated. 
Even after Prop. 64 was signed into law in November 2016, 
less than 10% of eligible Californians applied for record expungement. “The burden was placed on the individual,” he 
explained. “Parole officers and judges wouldn’t tell people. And 
even for those that were aware, the process was very difficult 
to navigate and very expensive. The system was essentially 
stacked against people of color and those with limited incomes.” 
With an eye on reversing the harms of marijuana prohibition, 
Rodney worked directly with lawmakers to draft legislation to As a staff attorney for DPA, 
Rodney Holcombe focuses on implementing aspects of Prop. 64, the historic ballot initiative that legalized marijuana in California. 
15automate record expungement, and 
organized free expungement clinics to 
help serve those impacted in the interim.  
“I visited communities all over the state 
and met so many people just looking 
for a path forward,” he recalled. “The 
clinics brought out way more people 
than we could help and at times it was overwhelming. I spent many long nights 
answering requests and helping to guide 
people through the process. But knowing 
that there were more people out there 
who looked like me, unable to find work 
or a place to live because of their record, 
that’s what kept me going.” 
Clinic participants came from all walks of 
life, from college students to day laborers 
trying to support their families to senior 
citizens still hopeful for a new beginning. 
In addition to pro-bono legal services, 
the clinics also provided wrap-around services that most often elude those 
carrying records, including information 
on accessing healthcare, immigration 
consultation and voter registration. 
“People were so excited to see food at 
the clinics. They were coming to us for 
much more than just legal advice.”
Rodney has kept in touch with some of 
the individuals he worked with directly. 
“I’ve heard from a few that they were finally able to get jobs and even vote for 
the first time.” 
In September 2018, Governor Jerry 
Brown signed the auto-expungement 
bill into law and the implementation has 
finally begun. 
“It’s a step forward, but the tremendous 
need reflects a larger humanitarian 
crisis around how we as a society deal 
with people with convictions,” Rodney 
explained. “The ability to clear one’s record can mean the difference between having housing and being homeless; 
having access to food and being hungry; 
living in poverty and being gainfully 
employed.” 
“Policy is an incremental process; we 
need to identify ways to address the 
larger, systemic issues,” he continued. “We need to keep going. This kind of 
reform is way overdue, but it needs to 
be made simple and accessible to truly 
serve those most harmed.” 
“When California is a free and accepting 
place that does not continue to punish 
people over and over for their past. And a place where people are no longer 
forever burdened by their mistakes, or 
things that should never have been a 
crime in the first place. That’s when we 
know the work is done.”16
Shifting away from a criminal justice approach  
to drug policy
Drug possession is the single most arrested offense in the 
U.S. In 2017, law enforcement made more than 1.63 million 
drug arrests, of which 85 percent (1.4 million) were for simple 
possession. Black people are more than two-and-a-half times 
as likely as white people to be arrested for possession for per -
sonal use, despite similar rates of use. Arrest does nothing to help those who may be struggling with problematic drug use. 
Meanwhile, those convicted then face the risk of incarcera -
tion, as well as tremendous barriers to finding jobs, housing, 
education and even voting.A significant piece of our work over the past year has focused on developing workable policy concepts to end this disastrous 
cycle of drug criminalization.
In November 2018, in partnership with the Open Society 
Foundations, DPA convened a group of 34 policy and legal 
experts from the U.S. and 16 other countries including 
Australia, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Ghana and 
Ireland. Each of these experts shared their experiences in 
implementing various decriminalization models and attempting to advance decriminalization in their home countries. With this 
new coalition, DPA is developing guidelines for how smart and 
effective decriminalization could be implemented at the local, 
state and national levels in the U.S.16DPA is leading the charge to 
decriminalize the possession of drugs for personal useBased on our findings so far, we believe 
an ideal drug decriminalization measure 
would seek to accomplish the following:
• Eliminate criminal penalties for drug 
use, possession for personal use, and 
possession of paraphernalia.
• Eliminate punitive, abstinence-based or 
coercive approaches to drug treatment.
• Avoid “net-widening” such as fines and fees that result in poor people being 
criminalized.
• Avoid loopholes through which law 
enforcement could seek to criminalize 
the same people (disturbing the peace, 
public nuisance ordinances, etc.).
• Include a criminal record expungement and resentencing component. 
• Expand harm reduction information and healthcare access for people who need it by reinvesting the money saved from 
law enforcement and incarceration.
• Increase access to wraparound 
services such as housing support, 
which are critical to people who are 
struggling with problematic drug use. 
DPA is exploring potential 
decriminalization ballot initiative 
campaigns for 2020 in various states. 
California, Oregon and Washington—all 
of which were leaders in marijuana 
legalization—show the greatest promise. 
We are also examining the potential for legislative campaigns in states worst 
impacted by the overdose crisis, though 
these will move more slowly.
Meanwhile, we have continued to 
press for reforms that pave the way 
for decriminalization. Given that 30 
states still punish drug possession (excluding marijuana) as a felony, this 
work includes our efforts to “de-felonize” 
drug possession in numerous states, 
as California, Oklahoma, Oregon and Connecticut have done in recent years. 
It also includes our ongoing work at the 
local level to initiate and implement Law 
Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) 
programs—which, instead of arresting 
people for drug use, diverts them to other 
services and supports—in numerous cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, 
Ithaca, Denver, Santa Fe and San 
Francisco. LEAD is the closest thing so far 
to decriminalization in the U.S.  
Fighting back against harsh penalties 
for drug offenses
A critical part of our work remains 
reforming and fighting back against 
overly harsh policies, including recent 
federal bills seeking to increase 
1718sentences for opioid-related offenses. 
In a crucial victory last year, DPA played 
a leading role in stopping the passage 
of SITSA, a sweeping bill that would 
have given the DEA and Justice Dept. 
free reign to criminalize more drugs 
and create new draconian sentencing 
policies, without any oversight. We expect similar proposals to emerge this 
year, in response to fentanyl in particular.
We’re also pushing back on “drug-induced 
homicide” laws, which prosecutors are increasingly using to charge people 
with murder or manslaughter for 
selling or sharing drugs that result in a 
death. We were successful in helping 
block new such laws in over a dozen 
states, including New York, Illinois, 
Massachusetts and Maryland last year.At the same time, we played an instrumen-tal role in ensuring that the federal First 
Step Act, signed into law in December,  
included drug sentencing reform provi-sions and did not merely tinker around 
the edges of the issue. While this bill has 
significant weaknesses and was a tough 
compromise for us, it has the potential to lead to the release of thousands of people 
serving disproportionately long sentences 
for drug law violations.
DPA also helped obtain a significant win 
in the U.S. Supreme Court in Indiana v. 
Timbs, establishing new limits on police 
departments’ ability to seize personal assets without due process.
With your support, we are working to 
transform the way this country responds to 
drug use, by ending the criminalization of 
millions and restoring hope and promise to 
hundreds of thousands of individuals.Arrest does nothing to 
help those who may be 
struggling with problematic 
drug use. Meanwhile, those convicted then face the risk 
of incarceration, as well 
as tremendous barriers to finding jobs, housing, 
education and even voting.Over three intensive days, participants learned firsthand about 
Portugal’s decriminalization model from government officials, 
local activists, medical professionals and law enforcement, 
as well as current and former drug users, who shared their 
experiences with the system. 
Partners learned about the model—which emphasizes the 
improvement of health and public safety outcomes over 
punishment—and the positive outcomes it has yielded, 
including more people opting to receive treatment and drastic 
declines in HIV/AIDS and drug overdose rates. 
DPA developed a briefing paper and companion video on the 
benefits of the Portugal model to encourage further discus -
sion on what a health-focused decriminalization model could 
look like in the U.S. • Learn more at drugpolicy.org/portugalLessons learned : 
DPA partner gathering in Portugal
In March 2018, DPA hosted our annual gathering of our funded partners 
(grantees) in Lisbon, Portugal. These groups represented more than 30 
community-based and advocacy organizations from across the U.S.
“I visited Portugal as part of a delegation of advocates 
led by the Drug Policy Alliance…As I met with public 
health officials, visited treatment facilities, and heard 
from law enforcement agents, as well as current 
and former drug users, what struck me most was 
the humanity of this approach. The focus is on 
supporting people and their health.” 
—Susan Burton, Founder and Executive Director of A New 
    Way of Life Reentry Project and DPA Funded PartnerEnding the global drug war , starting at home
For decades, the United 
States has poured billions of dollars into fighting a global war on drugs in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Afghanistan and the Philippines. 20In the name of cutting off the supply of 
drugs, the U.S. has financed militaries 
and police around the world, shaped 
their criminal justice and drug laws, 
provided equipment and supplies, and 
even directly intervened on the ground. 
More recently, the administration of 
President Donald Trump has attempted to build a wall on the southern border of 
the U.S. and further restrict immigration, 
in part in the name of blocking the entry 
of drugs. 
These efforts have been a spectacular 
and expensive failure. Neither supply 
nor demand have meaningfully decreased throughout the U.S.-led 
drug war. Instead, the drug war has 
contributed to a dramatic escalation of 
violence and corruption in the countries 
targeted.
 DPA has worked on global drug 
policy reform for years, including our 
successful efforts to legalize marijuana 
in Uruguay—the first country to do so. 
We are continuing this work, helping to 
advocate for cutting-edge reforms like 
all-drug decriminalization abroad, and 
bringing lessons to the U.S. from other countries, like Portugal. 
We are increasingly focusing our 
international work on the United States’ 
foreign policy concerning drugs—an 
area on which few, if any, organizations 
focus systematically, and where we 
have tremendous value added. We 
have started to closely examine U.S. 
appropriations to countries like the Philippines, where the U.S. is supporting 
a police force that has been implicated 
in thousands of extrajudicial killings 
of people alleged to use or sell drugs. 
We are working with allies in Mexico 21to shape the drug war debate there, including by supporting their efforts 
to legalize marijuana, and educating 
U.S. lawmakers about the harms of the 
current approach. And we are calling 
out the administration on the deep flaws 
in its narrative about immigrants and 
drug trafficking.
As we deepen this work, we intend to 
develop a comprehensive assessment of the waste and devastation caused by 
U.S. global drug policies, so that reform 
at home also translates into reform 
abroad.Special Opportunities Program

Voices Of Community Activists & Leaders 
(VOCAL-NY) is a grassroots membership organization that builds power among low-income people affected by HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, the drug war, homelessness, and mass incarceration. VOCAL-NY has been a DPA funded partner since 2006. Through the Promoting Policy Change and Special Opportunities Grants programs, DPA has provided more than $550,000 to date in support of the organization’s vital community organizing, direct action, and leadership development work. 
Our relationship with VOCAL-NY goes far 
deeper than fiscal support. DPA’s partners are essential allies in advancing the drug policy reform movement on the grassroots level. 
Jeremy Saunders, Co-Executive Director of 
VOCAL-NY, provides additional insight into the powerful alliance between his organization and DPA’s New York State Office.Our history as campaign partners
Beyond the grant program, VOCAL-NY and DPA have been working together for nearly a 
decade. Our first joint campaign was getting 
the Good Samaritan Act passed in New York in 2011. This life-saving legislation allows people to call 911 if they experience or witness an overdose without fear of arrest or criminal prosecution for possessing small quantities 
of drugs or alcohol. Since that winning 
campaign, we have gone on to partner on many more victories that save and improve the lives of drug users throughout the state. 
Bringing the strength of grassroots 
mobilization to DPA’s work
DPA also contracts with VOCAL-NY as a con-sultant when the political climate in New York presents us with special opportunities to win. Our expertise lies in the grassroots. For 20 
years, we have been mobilizing marginalized 
New Yorkers impacted by the war on drugs, developing their leadership, and uplifting their voices to change the narrative for both legis-lators and the general public. Most recently, we worked with DPA to help organize low-in-come New Yorkers who have been impacted 
or criminalized by drug use in Western New 
York, as well as in Los Angeles. 
Significant victories & more to come
Legislative accomplishments achieved through this partnership start with the 2011 Good 
Samaritan Law, and have continued with 
expanding access to naloxone, passing the Compassionate Care Act to establish medical marijuana in New York State, decriminalizing syringes, and pushing the NYPD to reduce 
marijuana arrests by 90% in New York City.  
But the work is not done! Right now, our orga-
nizations are looking to establish Overdose Prevention Centers and push for medications 
for opioid use disorder in prisons and jails. 
The road is long, but we look forward to con-tinuing this important journey with DPA.Andrew Tobias
