These discussions bring together advocates and allies in the justice reform movement to discuss how we can sustain progress, which obstacles still remain, and how we can use the current moment to be more aspirational with our policy agendas.Speakers:Stanley Andrisse, From Prisons to PhDSusan Burton, A New Way of Life Reentry ProjectJenny Collier, Collier Collective, Reentry Working Group of the Justice RoundtableLuis S.
