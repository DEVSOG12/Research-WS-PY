The report includes extensive analysis of marijuana arrest and income data, showing  that overall, low income and middle class communities of color face dramatically higher rates of marijuana possession arrests than do white communities of every class bracket. Most of those arrested are young men of color, even though young white men use marijuana at higher rates. Nearly 75% of the people arrested for marijuana possession in 2014 have never been convicted of even a single misdemeanor, and only 11% have a misdemeanor conviction. The report draws on data from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and concludes that despite a change in mayoral administrations and police commissioners, the NYPD continues its established practice of making wasteful, racially biased, and costly marijuana arrests.Drug Policy Alliance | Marijuana Arrest Research ProjectView the report.Criminal Justice ReformRace and the Drug WarReportNew YorkFeatured ResourcesEnd No-Knock Warrants and Militarized Quick-Knock RaidsDPA Podcast Episode 48: Classwide Scheduling of Fentanyl-Related Substances Won’t Save Lives - It Will Overcriminalize ThemMember NewsletterMore ResourcesRelated NewsPress Release10.13.22Civil Rights Groups, Policy Experts Welcome Sen.
