In 2013, the Center for Research on Globalization found that between 1980 and 2005, only six percent of terrorist attacks carried out on U.S. soil were committed by Muslims.More recently, researchers at Georgia State University remarked that “ Muslims carried out only 11 out of the 89 attacks, yet those attacks received 44 percent of the media coverage. (Meanwhile, 18 attacks actually targeted Muslims in America).”Alternatively, the committee could have focused on why the Department of Homeland Security spent millions of taxpayer dollars on a program that has exclusively targeted American Muslims. Similarly, they could have discussed reports that the Trump administration is considering rebranding CVE to “Countering Islamic Extremism” or “Countering Radical Islamic Extremism,” placing a disproportionate emphasis on acts carried out by Muslims in comparison to other perpetrators.It is important to note that no American community, its politics or religious beliefs should be placed under government scrutiny, or blacklisted.From its inception, the underlying goal of the CVE program has been to gain access to, surveil and collect information on the American Muslim community. This motive was exposed by the Trump administration’s withdrawal of CVE funds from projects that do not focus on Muslims and where law-enforcement is not involved.When the vice chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Steve Russell, asked Kerry Sleeper, the assistant director for the Office of Partner Engagement at the FBI, and George Selim, the former leader of the CVE Task Force, to offer a profile of a typical terrorist, both Sleeper and Selim were unable to provide one.Their response was not surprising given that Britain’s MI5 intelligence agency, which has engaged in CVE measures prior to the United States, concluded in 2008 that “it is not possible to draw up a typical profile of the ‘British terrorist’ as most are ‘demographically unremarkable.”In another 2010 report, titled “Preventing Violent Extremism,” the British Commons’ Communities and Local Government Committee concluded that, “there has been a pre-occupation with the theological basis of radicalization, when the evidence seems to indicate that politics, policy and socio-economics may be more important factors in the process.”So how do we move forward?The removal of monitoring and surveillance of the Muslim community would help rebuild trust between law enforcement and federal agencies and would re-empower the community to tackle internal issues openly and without fear.Moreover, public dialogue addressing U.S. foreign policy choices must take place. Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations notes that while there are CVE discussions in policy-making circles, “there is rarely any consideration of which U.S. foreign policy activities might themselves be precursors to U.S. terrorism.”The media should strive to present crimes in proportion to their occurrence, regardless of the perpetrators. The Georgetown Bridge Initiative has found that, “Western media coverage of Islam has been almost exclusively negative,” and Islam is “portrayed differently than other religions” with virtually no positive coverage.Scholars at the University of Illinois note that in media reports about domestic terrorism, Muslims were mentioned in 81 percent of stories, when they only accounted for six percent of attacks. Such coverage results in a disproportionate sense of threat from the Muslim community.While it is uncertain how President Trump will carry out CVE programing, we know that the problematic methods of information gathering, policing and monitoring of Muslim communities and their houses of worship will remain. George Selim’s recent resignation following the committee hearing is cause for alarm. It signals the Trump administration’s possible termination of outreach efforts to address the Muslim community’s concerns.All those who value the First Amendment right to practice one’s faith freely and without persecution must oppose any policies that single out a particular religious group.TrendingCAIR Welcomes Resignation of North Carolina Sheriff Over Racist CommentsOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR, Jetpac Release First National Directory of Local, State and Federal Elected Muslim Officials and JudgesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesVideo: CAIR-MN Director Jaylani Hussein Responds to Fargo Muslim Cemetery VandalismOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-LA Condemns Antisemitic Statements Made by Kanye West and the Disgusting Show of Support From Neo-Nazis in Los AngelesOctober 25, 2022Press ReleasesMaryland Community to Call on Montgomery County Council to Reject Disputed IHRA Definition of Antisemitism and Anti-Palestinian RacismOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Calls EU Court Ruling Allowing Hijab Bans in the Workplace a Setback for Religious FreedomOctober 24, 2022Press Releases‘American Muslim of the Year’ Award to Go to Ohio Student Athlete Noor Abukaram at 28th Annual CAIR BanquetOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-Pennsylvania to Join Emgage, Members of Muslim Community at 5th Annual Muslim Capitol DayOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesVideo: CAIR-MN Calls for Hate Crime Probe into Fargo Muslim Cemetery VandalismOctober 24, 2022Press ReleasesBREAKING: CAIR-MN Calls for Probe of Possible Bias Motive for Vandalism Targeting North Dakota Muslim CemeteryOctober 22, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-AZ Condemns Distribution of Antisemitic Flyers in TempeOctober 22, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Sentencing of Mississippi Man Who Threatened to Wage a Race WarOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR, Jetpac to Release First National Directory of Local, State and Federal Elected Muslim Officials and Judges, Embargoed Copies Available to MediaOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesAction Alert: Join Interfaith Advocates, Activists in Urging Montgomery County Council to Reject Resolution That Endangers Free Speech, Palestinian Human RightsOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-Houston Calls Texas Secretary of State’s Statement an ‘Obvious Attempt at Voter Suppression,’ Encourages Community Members to VoteOctober 21, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR Welcomes Hate Crime Charges for Wisconsin Anti-Immigrant IncidentOctober 20, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-OK, Community Partners to Host First Candidate Open HouseOctober 20, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-Ohio Holds Voter Registration Drives at MosquesOctober 20, 2022Press ReleasesPhoto: Maryland Muslim Prisoner Project, CAIR Hold Discussion on Challenges Incarcerated Muslims Face in and Beyond PrisonOctober 20, 2022Press ReleasesCAIR-DFW Welcomes Hate Crime Ruling for 2015 Murder of Muslim ManOctober 19, 2022Press ReleasesContact info453 New Jersey Avenue, SE Washington, DC 20003Tel: (202) 488-8787Fax: (202) 488-0833www.cair.comMore contact infoAbout UsVision, Mission, Core PrinciplesCAIR at a GlanceCAIR: Who We AreNational Board of DirectorsDepartment DirectorsAnnual Reports and FinancialsEndorsements, Awards, RecognitionsCAIR ChaptersDispelling Rumors About CAIRWorking with Law EnforcementNews & MediaMedia ContactsPress ReleasesOp-edsBookable SpeakersVideosMedia ResearchCAIR LogosPhotosGet involvedCareersInternVolunteerEventsBecome an AllyUse Your VoiceResourcesKnow Your RightsCivil Rights ReportsWays to GiveGuides and toolkitsGuides to Muslim Religious PracticesBook a CAIR WorkshopRequest a SpeakerRegister to VoteGovernment Affairs ReportsTake ActionReport an incidentAction AlertsScroll to TopPrivacy PolicyLegalVolunteerJoin our Email ListEventsContact UsFacebook-fTwitterInstagramYoutube© 2022 Council on American-Islamic Relations.Website designed by INTELLIPLANS
