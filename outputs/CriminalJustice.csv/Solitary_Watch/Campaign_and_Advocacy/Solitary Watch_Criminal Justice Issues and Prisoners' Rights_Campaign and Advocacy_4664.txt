She appears to have gone to Iraq as a true believer in the good of her country. She discovered there the American culture of punishment.” Cusac continues:Torture is American. It was American when Peterson died. It was American long before that. How do I know? I am a reporter who for years covered allegations of prison abuse and ill treatment in domestic U.S. prisons. Nearly every technique used at Abu Ghraib had a close, recent parallel in a U.S. facility…Just to mention a few parallels, inmates in domestic U.S. prisons have been threatened with electrocution, intimidated with dogs, restrained nude, and restrained for weeks. Some U.S. inmates have alleged that they were forced to soil themselves, an allegation that also arose in Iraq.So I didn’t feel surprise when the Abu Ghraib story broke. I felt a sickened familiarity. What bothered me more than Abu Ghraib was the outrage my fellow Americans expressed. Why were they so upset about torture in Iraq when similar punishments had been used in the United States in recent years? Peterson’s death says a bit about why. She didn’t know about such techniques until she saw the “interrogation techniques used on prisoners” with her own eyes. Prisons are closed, private places. Most of us don’t know, and would rather know little, about what life inside is like.And prisoners, even those who have been severely mistreated, can be less-than-sympathetic subjects. My subject matter has inspired baffled stares at high school reunions, jokes from schoolteachers about putting their students in stun belts, and yelling sessions in elevators. The response tends to be strong, and I feel a hitch in my stomach when a new acquaintance, upon hearing I am a reporter and writer, asks me my area of specialty.Contrary to such responses, Cusac concludes, “Our lives outside are linked to those inside, whether we admit this to ourselves or not.” You can read the full article here.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsAbu Ghraib,Allyssa Peterson,Anne-Marie Cusac,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Corrections Industry,Eighth Amendment,Federal Prisons,Human Rights,interrogation techniques,Iraq,Politics of Punishment,Psychological Effects,restraint chairs,Solitary Confinement,stun belts,Tasers,Terrorism Cases,Torture,war on terrorJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.
