The story, called “The Gray Box,” is by Susan Greene, who as a columnist at the Denver Post often wrote about the widespread use of solitary in Colorado’s prisons and at the federal supermax, ADX Florence.This is one of the most comprehensive articles ever written about solitary confinement in the United States, and is particulary noteworthy for including the voices of prisoners, obtained through correspondence with those buried in isolation. It is also passionate and personal. The opening follows–but this piece needs to be read in full.A few weeks ago, on the fifteenth anniversary of his first day in prison, Osiel Rodriguez set about cleaning the 87 square feet he inhabits at ADX, a federal mass isolation facility in Colorado.“I got it in my head to destroy all my photographs,” he writes in a letter to me. “I spent some five hours ripping each one to pieces. No one was safe. I did not save one of my mother, father, sisters. Who are those people anyway?”Such is the logic of the gray box, of sitting year after year in solitude.Whether Rodriguez had psychological problems when he robbed a bank, burglarized a pawn shop and stole some guns at age 22, or whether mental illness set in during the eight years he has spent in seclusion since trying to walk out of a federal penitentiary in Florida – it’s academic. What’s true now is that he’s sick, literally, of being alone, as are scores of other prisoners in extreme isolation.Among the misperceptions about solitary confinement is that it’s used only on the most violent inmates, and only for a few weeks or months. In fact, an estimated 80,000 Americans — many with no record of violence either inside or outside prison — are living in seclusion. They stay there for years, even decades. What this means, generally, is 23 hours a day in a cell the size of two queen-sized mattresses, with a single hour in an exercise cage, also alone. Some prisoners aren’t allowed visits or phone calls. Some have no TV or radio. Some never lay eyes on each other. And some go years without fresh air or sunlight.Solitary is a place where the slightest details can mean the world. Things like whether you can see a patch of grass or only sky outside your window – if you’re lucky enough to have a window. Or whether the guy who occupies cells before you in rotation has a habit of smearing feces on the wall. Are the lights on 24/7? Is there a clock or calendar to mark time? If you scream, could anyone hear you?In the warp of time and space where Rodriguez lives, the system not only has stripped him of any real human contact, but also made it unbearable to be reminded of a reality that has become all too unreal. It’s ripping him apart.“Looking at photos of the free world caused me so much pain that I just couldn’t do it any more,” writes Rodriguez, 36. “Time and these conditions are breaking me down.”This is what our prisons are doing to people in the name of safety. This is how deeply we’re burying them.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCivil Liberties/Civil Rights,Colorado,Cost/Budget Issues,Dart Society,Due Process,Federal Prisons,Mental Illness,prisons,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Supermax Prisons,Susan GreeneJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

As far as seeing light at the end of the tunnel, no I only hear and more importantly see support for further authoritative measures. Listen to the presidential debates when crime is mentioned.Smarter people than myself see a tightening of the system rather than a losing. Sorus believes the OWS crowd will turn violent and the government will respond with more force.Zbiginew Brezenski also sees possible social unrest over inequality with much the same response from the government. Will they put the leaders of such movements into Communication Management Units? Look at Russia, Syria, Egypt, Israel for clues and the this list keeps growing. Many people no longer feel their leaders protect the common man/woman but rather serve their own interests.Howard Zinn warned about this in his Peoples Historyof the United States in the last chapter.Page 635: In a system of intimidation and control, people do not show how much theyknow, how deeply they feel, until their practical sense informs them they can do sowithout being destroyed.In a highly developed society, the Establishment cannot survive without theobedience and loyalty of millions of people who are given small rewards to keep thesystem going….These people—the employed, the somewhat privileged—are drawn intoan alliance with the elite. They become the guards of the system, buffers between theupper and lower classes. If they stop obeying, the system falls.That will happen, I think, only when all of us who are slightly privileged andslightly uneasy begin to see that…we are expendable; that the Establishment, whateverrewards it gives us, will also, if necessary to maintain its control, kill us.The new conditions…make it less and less possible for the guards of thesystem…to remain immune from the violence (physical and psychic) inflicted on theblack, the poor, the criminal, the enemy overseas. The internationalization of theeconomy, the movement of refugees and illegal immigrants across borders, both make itmore difficult for the people of the industrial countries to be oblivious to hunger anddisease in poor countries of the world.Page 636: There is evidence of growing dissatisfaction among the guards. We haveknown for some time that the poor and ignored were the nonvoters, alienated frompolitical system they felt didn’t care about them, and about which they could do little.Now alienation has spread upward into families above the poverty line. These are whiteworkers, neither rich nor poor, but angry over economic insecurity, unhappy with theirwork, worried about their neighborhoods, hostile to government—combining elementsof racism with elements of class consciousness, contempt for lower classes along withdistrust for the elite, and thus open to solutions from any direction, right or left….Wemay, in coming years, be in a race for the mobilization of the middle-class discontent.The fact of the discontent is clear. The surveys since the early seventies show 70to 80 percent of Americans distrustful of government, business, the military. This meansthe distrust goes beyond blacks, the poor, the radicals. It has spread among skilledworkers, white-collar workers, professionals; for the first time in the nation’s history,perhaps, both the lower classes and the middle classes, the prisoners, and the guards,were disillusioned with the system.Like I said smarter people than myself. I do not advocate this but fear the disruption it will bring for everyone. But most of all the violent reaction of the system.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)January 26, 2012 at 11:28 amI have heard all these words and thoughts before face to face with those in solitary confinement who wish to see the stars in the sky or smell the green grass instead of the gray matter and steel that surrounds them.. Along with the stench of human waste, these human beings are being exposed to elements of mankind that will rot their bones and flesh and ruin any creativity or hope in their minds. Strange how “justice” works in this country today.ReplyMary Lou BrncikJanuary 26, 2012 at 3:56 amTruly one of the best pieces on Solitary I have ever read.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)January 25, 2012 at 11:43 pm@Alan – can you see the trend both in CA and other states related to solitary confinement? A giant is awakening and I think its more international than most people realize… I have been talking to the Amnesty International group in London and their conversations are very enlightening with a detailed report on solitary confinement coming soon. Curious on its content and findings ~~ maybe its the light we have been waiting for along with the works of the ACLU and other support groups addressing and fighting misconduct, torture and abuse in our prisons.ReplyJoyce GouwensJanuary 25, 2012 at 5:39 pmSolitary confinement should be limited to no more than three months.After that, mental deterioration sets in and the chance for success outside the walls goes down.There are better ways to achieve cooperation in a prison, as Maine is finding out.Prisons in Europe banned it long ago.It costs far more than regular prison cells, and is far more destructive.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085January 25, 2012 at 5:58 pmI stand corrected they read from Silverstein’s declaration on the video.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085January 25, 2012 at 4:53 pmBest article yet. Truly a passionate piece. She also wrote a good article on the Silverstein case last year. I am not sure why she didn’t include him in this piece since he has been held the longest in isolation within the Federal system.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)January 25, 2012 at 4:30 pmAs long as the courts don’t recognize the impairment these “gray boxes” create within our prison setting, we are beating our heads against the wall… The media is the most powerful tool we have to educate the judges, the attorneys and the advocates for better prison management including solitary confinement; but don’t expect it to come without a high price… your credibility will be attacked and your reputation will be compromised when breaking the code of silence.. I know… I have paid a dear price when I opened up my mouth about these lockdown units in Arizona. Now, its coming to the light and more people are speaking out but three years ago, it was taboo to whisper about it ~~~ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
