Bloomberg annouced a host  of extreme measures being taken by New York City in preparation for the arrival of Hurricane Irene, including a shutdown of the public transit system and the unprecedented mandatory evacuation of some 250,000 people from low-lying areas. But in response to a reporter’s question, the mayor stated in no uncertain terms (and with more than a hint of annoyance) that one group of New Yorkers on vulnerable ground will be staying put.New York City is surrounded by small islands and barrier beaches, and a glance at the city’s evacuation map reveals all of them to be in Zone A (already under a mandatory evacuation order) or Zone B–all, that is, save one. Rikers Island, which lies in the waters between Queens and the Bronx, is not highlighted at all, meaning it is not to be evacuated under any circumstances.According to the New York City Department of Corrections’ own website, more than three-quarters of Rikers Island’s 400 acres are built on landfill–which is generally thought to be more vulnerable to natural disasters. Its ten jails have a capacity of close to 17,000 inmates, and normally house at least 12,000, including juveniles and large numbers of prisoners with mental illness–not to mention pre-trial detainees who have yet to be convicted of any crime. There are also hundreds of corrections officers at work on the island.We were not able to reach anyone at the NYC DOC for comment–but the New York Times‘s City Room blog reported: “According to the city’s Department of Correction, no hypothetical evacuation plan for the roughly 12,000 inmates that the facility may house on a given day even exists. Contingencies do exist for smaller-scale relocations from one facility to another.”For a warning of what can happen to prisoners in a hurricane we need only look back at Katrina, and the horrific conditions endured by inmates at Orleans Parish Prison in New Orleans. According to a report produced by the ACLU:[A] culture of neglect was evident in the days before Katrina, when the sheriff declared that the prisoners would remain “where they belong,” despite the mayor’s decision to declare the city’s first-ever mandatory evacuation. OPP even accepted prisoners, including juveniles as young as 10, from other facilities to ride out the storm.As floodwaters rose in the OPP buildings, power was lost, and entire buildings were plunged into darkness. Deputies left their posts wholesale, leaving behind prisoners in locked cells, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests …Prisoners went days without food, water and ventilation, and deputies admit that they received no emergency training and were entirely unaware of any evacuation plan. Even some prison guards were left locked in at their posts to fend for themselves, unable to provide assistance to prisoners in need.UPDATE (Saturday midnight): In his final news conference of the day, Mayor Bloomberg defended his decision not to evacuate Rikers Island, stating: “It is higher than the Zone A areas and it’s perfectly safe.” Representatives of the mayor have made further statements to New York Magazine (see update at end) and the Wall Street Journal, also specifying that no part of Rikers Island is in Zone A. Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson went on Twitter to say the same thing. To our knowledge, the mayor’s office still has not clarified what zone, if any, Rikers Island is in, and has not responded to questions regarding the lack of any evacuation plan for the jail.UPDATE (Sunday 4 p.m.): The evacuation order for Zone A has ended, with the storm having considerably less impact on New York City than anticipated. The mayor’s office has issued further statements about Rikers, confirming that it is not in evacuation Zone A and comparing it to Roosevelt Island and City Island, which also were not evacuated. Critics have noted, however, that these other islands are in Zones B and C, while Rikers Island, according to the evacuation map, is not in any evacuation zone at all. Advocates also remain concerned about the admitted lack of any evacuation plan for the city’s island jail. The Center for Constitutional Rights issued a statement on the matter, and CCR spokesperson Jen Nessel said: “The maps I’ve seen all leave Rikers off the Zone scale, but even if it isn’t in Zone A where the mandatory evacuations are taking place, the fact that the Department of Corrections admitted there wasn’t even a hypothetical plan for 12,000 people who can’t exactly evacuate themselves if the situation worsens is disturbing.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesTagsBloomberg,evacuation,Hurricane Irene,New York,Politics of Punishment,Rikers IslandJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

This is a fair statement until you realize how easy it is to end up in jail. A little bit of weed in your pocket? Were you driving 25mph over the speed limit? It is a lot easier to become a criminal in this country than you realize. You dont realize how shitty the conditions are until you become a criminal. But once you are a criminal, no one gives a fuck what you have to say about the topic.ReplyValerie DavisSeptember 1, 2011 at 10:34 amSeems like we are not much different from the England of the 1600’s. Need I say more???ReplymooAugust 30, 2011 at 7:31 pmNow why does everyone seem to think evacuation means letting people loose on the streets? That’s the most ridiculous idea I’ve ever heard- all these zoo analagies and talk of rapists roaming New York. C’mon guys- if and hopefully when they build an evacuation plan it would be to transport the prisoners to other established holding centres. With 12,000 prisoners I can see why they’ve had trouble figuring it out, but what kind of state allows a prison with such high capacity to be built without any contingency plans?Ludicrous.ReplyJonathan PerriAugust 30, 2011 at 3:04 pmA NYC student activists has created a petition telling Mayor Bloomberg to create an emergency evacuation plan for Riker’s Island.It can be signed here: http://www.change.org/petitions/mayor-of-new-york-city-create-an-evacuation-plan-for-rikers-islandReplyJoshlynAugust 30, 2011 at 2:36 pmok i live in ny stateand we lost power at my home why i at grammy now lol and i mean we up in the mountens like schary or how ever you spell it lol but we for two day where stuck at home with no power still out that i know of at my home and oh yes the water floodeing kept us from going over roeds to get out anywhere ok we in the dam mountens and we got stuck still and your telling me this dam govment dumm anuff to let the poor inmates stay in rikers in low land when we in the mountens got massusly scewed by the storm i got one thing to say to the mayer or who ever made the call WTF are you thinken oh wate you wert thinking if you where you never would have left the poor inmate thare well i hope your hoe got hit hard to then ok no i dont home that but i hope you have to deel with something like they did thats so not cool to make them stay in a storm that your geting others out of even the keys tryed to get as meny as they can of thare inmates out when new orleans got hit yes the one jial did not make it but they got as meny as they could get out out so your makeing the state look harles and dummer then it should be so plese nexst time a nuther one hit if it is so safe where the inmates where left how bout you join them for the nexst onemay thare be light in the darknes of justiceReplyChristopher BerryAugust 30, 2011 at 10:47 amThe amount of clearly selfish, ignorant, judgmental, shallow, media-fed, close-minded responses here is very disturbing.Your blind and reckless lack of concern for other beings is sick.Now, I know starting with that won’t get any of your attention without pre-judgement and negative reaction, and it’s not the best way to spark healing, but damn, it’s just really sad, and I’m full of passion.Look deeper than me, than tv, you’ll start to see, how everything connects, the usual suspects, they never change, because you never change, just sit back and estrange.Get up and find new things, there’s so much more this life brings, yet you let your choices block you from love, it’s not from up above, it’s from in you, it is you, it’s everything, it’s everywhere.Hear this cipher and start to decipher how that man became a lifer, he’s the same as you, but you never put on his shoe, did you?No, you didn’t, you keep your love hidden, I wanna see it, start spittin’, whatever’s in you, let it come out, lose the doubt, that’s not what it’s about.It’s about love, not these rules or laws or the fit of a glove.If you don’t connect to how we’re all the same, these things you hate will never change.But hate is fear and fear is a gun, and shoot, why can’t you just let love come.It’s already here, just draped in fear, pull it back, let it be clear.ReplyIn Struggle (@In_Struggle)August 30, 2011 at 10:23 amWith the overwhelming feeling of being again in solitary confinement due to the pending doom according to the mainstream media outlets, the sense of hopelessness stood around the corner knowing very well how New York Corrections operates,I’ve decided to search through my social networks for more information in an attempt to shield my three year old son from such reported doom and step son who is currently in Riker’s Island.Realizing I wasn’t in solitary confinement and the emotions must be from the scars of so many years spent keep-locked and or in solitary confinement and maybe I can assist others. I’ve posted this question to reporters via twitter and am overjoyed you’ve listened in and responded accordingly so that the world can question practices within DOC.As a member of Rights for Imprisoned People with Psychiatric Disabilities it hasn’t been an easy journey righting alot of wrong within the Dept. of Corrections, nor within the NYPD in our pursuit towards alternatives to incarceration.But, your response along with so many others has opened a much needed dialogue, demonstrating the complete disregard towards other humans who come in contact with the Dept. of Corrections.Keep Up the Great and Much needed Work!Thank You All,Carlos S.ReplyNayeliAugust 30, 2011 at 4:10 amHow can they do that? Even if they are in jail , prisonets are stillhumans and the officers on duty should’n have gone thru what they did when hurricane katrina hitReplyKwame Somburu (birth name 1934 to 1979, Paul Boutelle)August 30, 2011 at 12:39 amThe overwhelming majority of people that have committed crimes in this country, have never been accused of crimes, never been prosecuted, never been jailed, have been rewarded in various ways, and have never been considered criminals.Fact: Wall Street’s foundation was selling slaves in 1714 (white, but mainly black), and the United States was founded on slavery, racism, sexism, and class oppression.Most of the original inhabitants of this country were massacred, enslaved, had their lands stolen from them, and were placed into concentration camps called reservations.George Washington owned more slaves than anyone else after the Revolution, and was also the biggest landowner (stolen property).The Constitution was the product of a small group of privileged white males (55 were invited) that met in secret behind locked doors with armed guards, in the Spring of 1787 in Philadelphia.No women, poor whites, Indians, people of African ancestry was present.White soldiers that fought in the Revolution were not allowed to vote in the first elections because they did not have property.About 1% of the female population was able to vote, but after 1807, women were not allowed to vote.This country was founded on horrible crimes that included: rape (that is the major reason for the varied complexions, whites were raping black women and Indian women throughout US history, and it has not ended.Lynchings were a popular pastime from the end of the Civil War up to the present day.On December 3, 2010, a 26 year old black male was lynched in Mississippi (research it on the internet.Many thousands were lynched in this countries racist history, and 99% of the lynchers were never punished.Up to about 1914, it was legal to kill Indians.The state of California was paying bounty hunters for killing them and bringing their scalps or heads to a payment centers.After the Civil War, the US Army used many former black soldiers who fought in the war, to protect whites who were moving west to settle on land stolen from Indians.At the same time tens of thousands of blacks and many white allies, were being slaughtered in the Southern states.The Mexican War of 1846 to 1848, stole more than half of Northern Mexico, and now racists are calling Mexicans illegal immigrants.The US massacred hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in order to colonize and rob it.Hawaii had its government overthrown and taken over by US corporations.Over five million South East Asians were murdered by the US from during the war against Vietnamese independence.Here are a few books for those that desire an education:A People’s History of the US, by Howard Zinn, The Robber Barons by M. Josephson, White Cargo (about white slavery in America) by D. Jordan and M. Walsh, Slavery by Another Name by D. Blackmun, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown.This is a government of the rich, by the rich and for the rich.The real criminals are the tiny minority that own and control the wealth, land, corporations, their government, and their political parties.On the internet, check out: Information Clearing House, Truth Out, Smedley Butler, Democracy Now, and Common Dreams.org.Those are a few places where those that desire it can begin to get a real education.Also, enter: http://vimeo.com/18611069, and see me in 1968 on the William Buckley Show when I was a candidate for Vice-President.I no longer belong to that organization, but am still very active against any and all forms of oppression and discrimination nationally and internationally, as I approach my 77th birthday in October.Also, I served 3 days on Rikers in 1959, for traffic tickets until I could pay them.I worked for 59 years at many and varied occupations: public school teacher, taxi driver, real estate agent, porter, educational sales, and a tutor, I retired last year.ReplyDianeAugust 29, 2011 at 3:14 pmDeb wa , dont be so quick to judge, you never know what could happen to you or someone you know or love.Dont Judge people until you know the factsReplyDianeAugust 29, 2011 at 3:10 pmPaul , yes there are detainees there, but there are some who have been sentenced up to a year.

Quite frankly prisoners are treated with a high quality of care and get free medical coverage every other day of their sentence. How many Americans can say that they are being house, hospitalized and feed for the entire year without charge? So if the defenders of the constitution out there, god bless them, wish to make jail even more appealing to the impoverished by touting that they need an evacuation plan. Be wary of the irony that makes imprisonment as a punishment for a person struggling to, oh let’s say, get a necessary operation, or a crown.ReplyDeb WaAugust 29, 2011 at 11:16 amJesus, this IS an over-reaction. It’d take 10-times the manpower—and probably 100 times the cost—to move a prisoner rather than an ordinary citizen. Criminals choose to give up their rights the moment they choose to do the crime. Some would say they shouldn’t be part of the line at all… but if they’re on it, they’re at the end!ReplydavidAugust 29, 2011 at 9:49 amOH MY GOD A HUGE STORM IS COMING LETS TRANSPORT ALL THESE PRISONERS SOMEWHERE ELSE AT A HUGE EXPENSE/RISK……… Typical overreaction by the media. New Orleans= below sea level Cat 3 possibly 4, New york= Above/at sea level and Cat 1 possibly 2 not the same at all . Also hurricanes move very slowly and if it had been upgraded there was plenty of time to evacuate the prisoners at a later time.ReplySarah JBAugust 29, 2011 at 7:34 amYou bet your ass if the mayor gets caught with drugs or having an affair he will be the first one begging forgiveness like all the others, yet I hear that some people in Riker’s are not even convicted or haven’t had a trial yet – how quick he is to JUDGE!ReplyAJAugust 29, 2011 at 2:58 amHave any of you ever witnessed treatment of prisoners in any other country? Prisoners here are living in a lap of luxury. If you just want even ONE good example, watch the movie MIDNIGHT EXPRESS (based onTRUE STORY) if you want to know how people are treated in the rest of the world. Maybe people shouldn’t break the law, and they wouldn’t end up in Riker’s Island anyway. Those politicians prob wish that place would go down with Irene. Sure it would be a tragedy and folks would be in an uproar for a little while, but it would give jobs to rebuild it and would alleviate a large drain on the economy of the state. Prisoners are the only citizens of the US that get 100% medical care at no cost, not even to mention food, housing, etc. Well no cost to THEMSELVES…. a huge cost to tax payers.ReplyDana HuseAugust 29, 2011 at 2:12 amI doubt if any of you will actually take action about this matter.Loose some, leave some – in a time of immediate danger you want to SORT people?ReplyJustineAugust 29, 2011 at 12:15 amThey supposedly ok.

When they suddenly found themselves unprepared. Evcacuation is not any easy thing to be done and not the first plan of action. However there may come that time. There has to be a plan .The inmates are human beings. They are there to be punished for what they have done wrong. after doing so they are free to move on and hopefully become decent citizens.However while incarcerated the city is responsible for their safety.ReplyCharles VeitAugust 28, 2011 at 6:13 pmSo many people think it’s best if we leave the prisoners behind, and let them die. After reading some of these comments it’s become obvious that some of these commentors are animals them selves. I know a family that has a 15 year old son on Rikers. He’s awaiting trial after being caught trying to steal a set of hub caps off a car that was on a dealers lot. So you people that said let them die have shown us you’re closer to being an animal than many of the prisoners that were left behind. You’re guilty of a crime much worse than those committed by many of those prisoners. I guess if your house gets flooded we shouldn’t send any one to your aidReplyDHAugust 28, 2011 at 6:13 pmThank you David, hurricane or no hurricane, the inmates of the island are not properly in my opinion. I myself as a visitor am not treated properly so can you imagine how the inmates are treated behind closed doors.ReplyMark PettyAugust 28, 2011 at 5:58 pmI would ask one question to all those who said things like “let ’em rot” or “they deserve it”:if you feel that way, do you advocate that all those or any other prisoners at any level should be killed right now?We have a system to treat those convicted fairly and and appropriately.Natural disasters should not have any negative effect on that system.Some of these comments here are barbaric and disgusting!ReplyHeidiAugust 28, 2011 at 5:57 pmApparently a lot of people don’t understand what a prison sentance really is. It’s a loss of liberty, that’s all. if convicted of a crime, you lose the right to go where you want for a set period of time. That time does not include being tortured, frozen, starved, drowned, ignored, denied medical attention, denied shelter, etc. These are the laws and the system that our country has created. If you have a problem with the fact that our penal system isn’t supposed to be CRUEL to our incarcerated, then you will have to go about changing the laws on the books and our entire prison system, (which at its best is way overcrowded). Better start writing your congressperson about how criminals don’t deserve any protections. Maybe they will just let them out then.ReplyhelenredmondAugust 28, 2011 at 5:46 pmI bet Mayor Bloomberg’s response would have been different if Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK) was still imprisoned at Rikers Island.ReplyBillydinpvdAugust 28, 2011 at 5:25 pm@Dexter Morgan – “Some monsters don’t deserve to live.”You mean like people who can’t make bail?

BS.ReplyBillydinpvdAugust 28, 2011 at 5:17 pm@Mark P. Kessinger – Wow, thank God the only possible reason for ever needing to evacuate a jail is a hurricane, huh? Good thing nothing bad ever happens on a grand scale in NYC…You need to do your own homework. The outrageous thing here is not so much that Rikers wasn’t evacuated, but that it CANNOT be evacuated because the authorities haven’t bothered to come up with a plan – any plan – to evacuate prisoners for any reason whatsoever — terrorist attack, some other natural disaster, nothing.ReplyJoseph BakerAugust 28, 2011 at 5:09 pmThe zones A, B, & C are flood zones on designated FEMA maps… Also there is a V (velocity zones) which were not described in the article.The A, B, & C zones are designated based the the elevation of the site above the expected flood levels based upon a 100 year and 500 year flood levels.These levels are calculated based upon real data.In the case of Rikers Island, it is not in either an A, B, or C flood zone and therefore was not in danger of being flooded.Therefore there was no chance that the facility would be flooded by this hurricane as its elevation was well above the anticipated flood level and the possible storm surge from the hurricane.The other islands in the New York area that are in the low lying areas (Flood zone A) which was at the level of the anticipated flood level and storm surge were evacuated.To evacuate all areas including those which were not anticipated to be flooded would be a logistical impossibility.The Mayor did the responsible thing and only evacuated those people in danger and thus avoided unnecessary inconvenience for other folks not in danger.The people on Rikers Island were not in danger and were inside of structures that were more than adequate to survive a direct hit by the hurricane.ReplyDeacon BAugust 28, 2011 at 5:03 pmTitle: Evacuation plan neededThe city has no evacuation plan for Rikers Island, despite its low elevation and its nearly 13,000 prisoners.

Heads should roll, metaphorically speaking. This ought to end somebody’s career.ReplyDavidAugust 28, 2011 at 4:31 pmThere are human tragedies and inhuman tragedies.The treatment of Rikers Island inmates falls in the “inhuman” category.ReplyLenoAugust 28, 2011 at 4:11 pmA city the size of New York creates it’s own unique problems, like the need to have a facility to house 12,000 people either charged with or convicted of crimes, many of which are violent offenders. How is it possible to safely and securely evacuate this many people without putting corrections officers that would have to transport them or the public in general in harms way? And where do you put this many detainees while the storm passes? Yes many are awaiting trial and haven’t been convicted yet but they have still been arrested for a crime. I see a lot of people with sympathy but no one seems to have a solution about what to do and how to safely do it… I wouldn’t want to have to be the one to evacuate the worst of the people there, the ones facing the possibility of loosing the rest of their life to a prison cell and may feel they have nothing to loose by taking advantage of the situation, or worse yet a bunch of them deciding that this is a chance to make their break together. If anyone thinks that all these people would be thankful for an evacuation and not create a problem you’re thinking is misguided. Yes there may be some, but not those who feel they have nothing to loose. I’m just thankful that this responsibility doesn’t rest on my shoulders, it’s a damned if you do damned if you don’t scenario… I guess the city should have considered a possible evacuation scenario of Rikers before now.Replythe bigger picture...August 28, 2011 at 3:54 pmGod forbid you are ever accused of something you didn’t do and are awaiting trial only to be found as guilty as so many of the replies have found these people…I sure don’t want to be in the room when judgement day comes for them. People, this is the United States of America, not Afghanistan! We believe innocent until proven guilty. Are you also missing the part where there are juveniles and mentally ill persons there? Clearly they need to be evacuated to a safe and secure alternative…not left to die or starve! And it’s no wonder there is so much violence in our society…as this kind of hate only begets more hate! Wake up and think!

Micah-justice is served? Are you the jude jury and executioner? You’re ignorant as hell.What give us as masses the right to take away someones rights? There are people on that island, detained not convicted of a crime, guards, as well as people that work there and have led good lives.What if you had made the choice to be a guard or social worker? Fighting for the greater good and we decided to leave YOU to the throws of a storm. Some people are ridiculous!This is not right. and there no pretending it is. We are not upholding our constitution nor treating people in a humane way.

But that’s just it, once someone is incarcerated they are no longer looked upon as a human being, as someone’s mother, father, brother or child not to mention that in the female jail on Rikers there is a nursery with infants that live with their mothers. This is not the first disaster to hit and im sure it will not be the last with the way things are happening my question is what happens next time?ReplyMark P. KessingerAugust 28, 2011 at 1:59 pmI’m no “law & order” type, nor is Mayor Bloomberg my favorite politician.And if there were any substance to what is being alleged here, I would be the first to be outraged by it.But it is sensationalist bullshit.Rikers Island has an average elevation of 26 feet (or about 8 meters) above sea level. (Source:U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey,http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:2928471596165466::NO::P3_FID:962524 ). As such, it is perfectly appropriate that it is not included in evacuation “Zone A.” In fact, there are plenty of residential neighborhoods that sit at a lower elevation and also border a waterway in NYC that have not been evacuated (Long Island City, to name but one).In addition, the complex has many buildings that are at least 10 stories tall. The projected storm surge is 4′ to 8′, and thus is not projected to present any significant risk to the Rikers prisoners.Here is a topographical map as well:http://www.trails.com/topo.aspx?lat=40.79065&lon=-73.88096&s=50&size=s&style=drgsrIt’s easy to fall for this kind of thing, but it pays to do your own homework.Replyfrances girouxAugust 28, 2011 at 1:29 pmWhat right does Bloomberg have making this decision on their lives?

This is a test on humanity.How we react to this situation shows God who is still faithful to Him. God forgives and knows we can save the prisoners.

A majority of people are renters and have no control over their property, whether it is boarded, and secure. People who stay behind and require emergency assistance, put an unnecessary drain on an already taxed response system. And, a lot of people don’t always know what is best for their own safety, particularly I a region that only sees a hurricane once in 25 years.None of these things are a factor at Rikers. It is a facility that is most likely to weather the storm without incident. Medical and emergency services are readily available within the facility itself. And the safety of inmates and building are within the control of the State already.It isn’t an inhumane decision, it is a prudent one.ReplyJ ScottAugust 28, 2011 at 12:00 pmWhile I agree with most of you let them rot I do not want the Officers there to suffer the same fate. We have enough issues with the public not realizing what we do and how hard we work in the system they only see the bad things that happen and are blown out of proportion most occasions.BUT maybe someone should get a hold of the slosh zone map that was created after the last hurricane and how much of Rikers Island would really be under water. Yes the inmates are inmates but we are charged with saving their lives.

Those who are dishonest, cunning and wicked. They can’t believe there are honest, sincere and good people. They judge others by their own values, and that is why they are always suspicious. As for those who are noble and unselfish, it is difficult for them to see wickedness, betrayal and treachery, for they too see others through the prism of their own qualities.Human beings can only see through their own eyes, and they fashion what they see with their own thoughts, feelings, desires and tendencies. When you meet people who talk only of others’ faults, know that on the whole they are telling you about themselves, for, if they were noble, kind, honest and, above all, loving, they would find all these good qualities in others, too.”– Omraam Mikhael AivanhovReplydc3galAugust 28, 2011 at 11:09 amWould’ve been nice if the question the reporter asked had been stated in the article.Also the headline of the article suggests the prisoners are there alone, locked up.So did the guards leave or what?Badly written article.

We think we are so special but look at all the other countries that have stood up for themselves, as we have done nothing.America is almost over.The corporations run it all and we allow it.So when we wonder how it happened, we need to look into the mirror.When the kids and grandkids ask what we did to protect them, we can say “Well, I clicked a lot of ‘like’ buttons”We get the country we deserve, sadly our kids will be so controlled it will be that much harder to revive America.We can never say we will do anything to help our kids.Most won’t get off the couch to help them.ReplyLoretta ParaguassuAugust 28, 2011 at 11:01 amIs Bloomberg at the cracking point where he can’t deal with the situation and can’t take any more stress? His job is to look after the needs of everyone in the City of New York. Not having a plan for Riker’s Island is a poor example of city management. He is NOT DOING HIS DUTY!

You cant blame the parents all the timeReplyMicahAugust 28, 2011 at 9:59 amJustice is served.There is always a slew of people waiting in line to criticize those who imprison criminals, but rarely someone who will stand up for the victim’s rights.There are those of you who will argue that prisoners are treated unfairly, while your tax money is being used to give these men/women cable television, internet access, three meals a day, and exercise facilities.We afford these CRIMINALS more than many of our own, hard-working citizens are even able to earn.Is that right?Inmates can’t lose their home, their job, their food, etc. No, instead, they are able to sit at a fixed means, healthy and well, while the majority of OUR OWN PEOPLE — among which are the victims of the crimes for which the prisoners are serving sentences — continue to suffer through economic roller coasters and politicians’ empty promises, keeping us forever at bay from the peace of mind that our own children will be fed THEIR 3 meals a day.Is THAT just?Recently, another post stated that this instance demonstrates the mentality of the people who think it necessary to imprison a human being at all.My guess is that this person has never witnessed or been the victim of a serious crime, and the same of his/her friends or loved ones.Is it more logical, then, to allow murderers to roam free; free of consequence, inhibition, and the fear of capture?Is it more practical to allow one man to rot in prison (under rather plush conditions in many cases) than for many victims to suffer at his hands?Is it righteous to allow thieves to plunder what they will?This is the sort of far leftist drivel that makes me sick.You have an appetite for defending convicted (yes, I understand some of these have yet to be, officially) criminals, but not the welfare of innocent children.You’ll stand up and fight for the assailants’ rights, but not the victims’.When will you see that the laws we have in place, regarding crime, are well-known and long-standing?When a person commits a crime, they are FORFEITING their rights to live among free people.Depending on the crime, they are forfeiting their life.It’s not my belief that any man has the right to take another man’s life, but I’ll be the first to put my finger on the trigger for the sake of the greater peace.There IS such a thing as the lesser of two evils.Is it worse to kill one man or idly watch 5 die at his hand?Perhaps I’m wrong.Maybe I’m being too brazen and old-fashioned.I should show them more compassion… In fact, now that I think of it… perhaps the lesser of two evils IS to give inmates more rights and freedom, yadda yadda.Here’s my proposal:To everyone who feels inmates are treated unfairly, and that imprisonment is barbaric and wrong: Instead of locking criminals away, where they can’t hurt innocent people anymore, YOU should host them in your homes!YES!Splendid!YOU will feed them.YOU will clothe them.YOU will provide them with shelter.YOU will decide their punishments when they do wrong, and likewise, YOU will be held accountable for their actions when you cannot control them.Host a criminal.Let the world know how it works out.Any takers?:-)ReplyScrewtapeAugust 28, 2011 at 9:51 amWhat about the “boat” if that thing gets loose and floats away then they’d have a hell of a problemReplyAlan CYA#65085August 28, 2011 at 9:40 amI have to say it is interesting to unmask the public like this. I am not surprised by those in support of the inmates nor those that are willing to let them die.It doesn’t matter if the institution is in an evacuation zone or not to accomplish this.I as an ex-inmate I have read truth on both sides of this issue here but neither has the whole truth.There are evil people held there that could do the public harm precisely because of the let them die mentality and I speak about both the guards and the inmates. Why should an escaped con care about those that react to their life and death issues so self-righteously and negatively? Would you?On the other hand to not recognize that some of these inmates are damaged possibly beyond repair is to be delusional.That said as I sat those long hours in that cell it was the one most reoccurring fear I had, as a California inmate I feared being buried in the rubble of an earthquake with no one interested in saving me but hey drowning is not my cup of tea either.The point is when the system takes away your liberty they are responsible for your safety.Oh and for you law and order crowd. My offenses for my incarceration were such things as run away, and disturbing the peace.I left the system served 6 years in the military at the end of Vietnam, finished college using the G.I.Bill and raised four healthy well adjusted children and put them all though college.People make mistakes and given a chance many reform themselves. The system did nothing for me.Just thought at least one ex-inmate should speak out.ReplyBecky borsAugust 28, 2011 at 9:39 amReally this is a hard call~yet I agree for the fact that if one (MANY WOULD HAVETAKEN ADVANTAGE COMPASSION ~yet they showed no compassion in their crimes )chose to escape that would put others in danger~maybe some not yet convicted could have been moved~it is a difficuolt call but there are mnay levels to condsider~would you want an escape breaking into your space threating your family and fiends `YEA..THATS HOW IT WORKS..jUST SAYINGReplythe Garbage GuysAugust 28, 2011 at 9:21 amThey’re safe as long as there isn’t a fire of some sort.

Rikers does house pretrial inmates as well as inmates sentenced up to 3 YEARS. That’s why it is called a correctional facility. All the hyperbole about the severity of the storm and the crimes of the inmates is not necessary. Ignorance is bliss, I’m sure. Those of you who have convinced yourselves of these ominous people lurking and waiting to rob, rape, and murder you, please knock it off. There but for the grace of God go I. NOBODY is innocent. I’m sure more than a few of you have not reported income on your taxes before. Have had a couple glasses of wine and still felt ok to drive. Have bought a used car and lowered the price on the bill of sale to avoid high DMV taxes. That’s called Presenting a false document for filing and is a class E felony! Had your luck been bad enough, you might be right out there with these same people you are looking down your righteous noses at. Let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone.

If those people want to be treated fairly, maybe they should have thought about that before they landed their PATHETIC existence in prison! Im glad they didn’t evacuate, it keeps the people who work there from being exposed to the chaos presented by moving 17,000 potentially dangerous people. This is really hilarious to me. My mother is a correctional officer. If any of you people knew what those imates put correctional officers though, ha! You would leave them right where they are as well! Id like to see any of you doing the work it takes to move people like armed robbers, murders, and child molestors. ALSO, I cant BELIEVE why anyone would be “outraged” at what happened in Katrina! If I were an officer, I sure as hell wouldnt be risking my life to save anyone! Makes total sense, who knows what inmates would do to an officer that let them out in that chaos!

Where it is located is not being evacuated. None of the areas surrounding it or near it are. The south shore of Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island are in danger and have been cleared out. Rikers Island is off the North shore of Queens, closely surrounded by land and has a high elevation. There may be some flooding, but not significant in order to require evacuation. It has no zone, there are 3: A,B, and C. If you don’t have a zone it means you are at a high enough elevation to not warrant one.ReplyR S ATLienAugust 28, 2011 at 8:15 amIf people did not act like animals then they would not be treated like this.

We should have learned lessons from Katrina, lessons on how to make hurricanes safer for everybody involved. Instead we have leaders who are responsible for evacuating New York and ensuring the safety of it’s residents not even considering not even considering the prisoners and staff of Rikers. If they didn’t have the time to consider evacuating Rikers, what else didn’t they have the time to plan out? What else got shortcutted, skirted around? Residence would almost be better off evacuating themselves rmight be ather than deal with the apathy of this country. It might be safe to say that not a hell of a lot of people in the government are in it for anyone but themselves.ReplyMiriam SnyderAugust 28, 2011 at 12:26 amNo concern for Rikers Island because Hurricane Irene is an induced man made disaster implemented for practice and training in killing innocent people by regions:http://knol.google.com/k/ms-snyder/nyc-earthquake-and-hurricane-irene/20jtp2r68qkfx/16#viewReplyphil cominsAugust 28, 2011 at 12:09 amThis article is somewhat deceiving, as they did not capture at the beginning of the article the full quote from Mayor Bloomberg, which I heard, listening this afternoon to the press conference.He said “we are not evacuating Rikers Island because we’ve classified it the same as zone c so it doesn’t need to be evacuated” – I’m not quoting exactly but it was pretty much words to that effect.Elevation wise this would be reasonably accurate.Nothing terrible happened during Gloria back in 1985, so this one is really a non-issue and the reporting should have reflected that.Shame on Jean Casella and James Ridgeway.ReplyJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaAugust 28, 2011 at 12:37 amWe did not misquote the mayor. If you will look at the date you will see that our article was written yesterday–and in yesterday’s news conference Mayor Bloomberg said nothing about what zone Rikers Island might be in; he simply stated that it would not be evacuated. We quoted his words accurately, as did several major news organizations. Any subsequent clarification was made only after thousands of people wrote, called, and tweeted about this matter. Our understanding is that the mayor’s office has now stated that Rikers is not in Zone A–the zone which has been evacuated. It still has not stated what zone, if any, Rikers Island IS in, or why, according to the Department of Corrections, “no hypothetical evacuation plan for the roughly 12,000 inmates that the facility may house on a given day even exists.”ReplyjustinAugust 28, 2011 at 12:05 amthank you george, thats exactly what i’ve been saying for the past fivethousand posts that no one fucking reads.and @ people hating on sara, obviously something has happened to her in the past to cause her to say that.though the government takes the motto “better to let ten guilty men walk free than to let one innocent be sentanced wrongly”,i completely DISAGREE.if i were incorrectly sentenced to a term in prison along with thousands of murderers and rapists and pedophiles, and someone wanted to liquidate the prisons, kill everyone in them,i wouldent mind dying if it ment the thousands of murderers and rapists dying along with me.ReplyizzydoesitAugust 28, 2011 at 12:03 amSome of the comments above sound like the party line of a totalitarian government that believes that if you can’t or won’t completely obey and produce–and consume–you’re simply garbage waiting to be taken out.That ruthless, inhumane attitude is unfortunately held by many of the people who run this country and only feeds the hatred the world feels for us. As a country we are first and foremost out for ourselves, but as history proves time and again, you can only manipulate and exploit others for so long before they finally tire of being abused by a mean, selfish bully.ReplybAugust 27, 2011 at 11:55 pmDie in a hurricane kinda falls under cruel and unusual, and everyone is protected against that kind of punishment in the Bill of Rights. But if you’re not concerned about the criminals, then try to care about the innocent people who work there or are awaiting trial or are wrongly convicted.ReplyAlexanderiaAugust 27, 2011 at 11:34 pmI think that is bullshit. I mean yes some of the people in prison are there for committing terrible crimes. I am not saying the they should be free but damn at least take them to another prison or something and let them serve their time.

First take the plank out of your own eye and all that.ReplyAidanAugust 27, 2011 at 10:51 pmAlthough this is a typical response it does not make it an ethical or humane response. Bloomberg and anyone else responsible for the neglect and murder of so many human lives should first be held accountable and immediately required to evacuate these people in prison.ReplyKelbyAugust 27, 2011 at 10:25 pmMy prayers are with all these prisoners that have to suffer and live the agony of being forgotten.

Prisoners are treated as badly as vermin. Sure, there are some downright evil people in who are imprisoned, but that does not give us the right to take away their fundamental rights. I sincerely hope that everyone who reads this blog decides to write to Bloomberg and other top officials in NYC. Also, as a side note, I highly encourage people to support prisoners in other ways, like donating books to prisons and writing letters to prisoners.

I pray to god you dont ever have to experience it.If you do then you will know howthe ignorant statement you made feelsReplyMatt NajAugust 27, 2011 at 9:42 pmFirst off Hurricane Katrina isn’t analogous to Hurricane (won’t be by the time it hits NY) Irene.Katrina was mostly an infrastructure problem with a levy that wasn’t up to code.On top of that the government’s inept ability to handle a disaster of that size.The town failed to evacuate everyone.The state didn’t not have the manpower to deal with Katrina before or after it hit Louisiana.Finally, the post Katrina aid and rebuilding was quite pathetic when it came to the response of the Bush administration.Second off, by the time Irene hits NY it will be a tropical storm and they will probably be the safest inside the prison.If this were an ACTUAL disaster, then perhaps I could see the big deal here.Instead, this piece that was written by Jean Casella and James Ridgeway seems to be intended to rile up people…for no good reason.If there was a total disaster, like the tsunami and earthquake in Japan for example, then I could see us all bleeding our hearts for the prisoners and should demand that the prisoners be taken someplace that is safer.So I don’t see the point of this article really.Am I supposed to feel bad for the prisoners?If we want to talk about mandatory minimums, the war on drugs, or the privatization of prison systems…..I will protest with anyone about those issues.A little rain storm coming to New York?Gimme a break….ReplyLizAugust 27, 2011 at 9:12 pmDear Jean and James:Thank you very much for writing this and getting everyone all fired up. After reading 90% of the blogs on here and doing some Google-ing myself chances are PRETTY damn good Irene (she barely registers as a hurricane at this point) will damage any of the Island with it being so high above sea level. Ladies and gentlemen: this storm will not wipe them out and become Armageddon for Rikers Island inhabitants. Let’s everyone calm down and switch to decaf.

Bloomberg ordered a mandatory evacuation of all people in the low-lying “Zone A” category, as well as the entirety of the Rockaways in Queens.Rikers Island does not touch the Atlantic Ocean and, like Manhattan Island, Roosevelt Island and City Island, it does not need to be evacuated, Mr. LaVorgna said.“We are focused on the areas where real dangers exist,” the spokesman said.A full Corrections Department staff will remain on Rikers Island during the storm and, according to Mr. LaVorgna, the jail is a fully self-sustaining facility “prepared to operate and care for inmates in extended emergency conditions.” http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/08/27/hurricane-irene-rikers-island-no-evacuation-at-citys-main-jail/ReplyFocusAugust 27, 2011 at 8:13 pmRiker’s island is safe.It’s way more above sea level than the other coastal areas.I know many of you are looking for a good excuse to bitch and moan about bloomberg and I’m sure many of you are looking to scream racism ,etc.So with that being said about the felons being safe, THEY’RE FRIGGEN FELONS!They lost their rights when they committed felonys!There is no danger to them so why in hell would the island be evacuated!??ReplyNicoAugust 27, 2011 at 8:12 pmGiven NY budget woes, leaving them to drown might actually work out well for the city financially.ReplySaraAugust 27, 2011 at 8:10 pmtake em out back and shoot them all….waste of space and tax dollars as it is.ReplySam WalkerAugust 27, 2011 at 8:05 pmThe day we have to choose who to save is the day we have failed as a society.ReplySam WalkerAugust 27, 2011 at 8:01 pmThe day we give up on a human is the day we lock him away.

Anyone accused of a crime is entitled to a lawyer under the state and federal constitutions, and if you cannot afford a lawyer, one is appointed for you as soon as you are arraigned in criminal court.The other thing I’d like to say, as a former public defender, is that it is easy to distance oneself from people who are accused of crimes (or who are serving less than one-year sentences, as is the case at Rikers), if you haven’t had any experience with them. But in actuality they are people, many of whom are scared teenagers, or drug addicts, or the mentally ill.The main thing is that they are people, with parents and family and friends, just like all of us, and it is really scary to see how some of the commenters here refer to them.ReplyKaty OttoAugust 27, 2011 at 6:29 pmThese are human beings.

I bet some of you even call yourselves Christians, when you’re violating the most basic principles of Christianity by posting what you’ve posted here.You’re almost certainly morally worse than the vast majority of people on Riker’s, who have not been convicted of anything.If I thought like you people did, I’d be wishing that Irene would drown you all. But I don’t think that way, so I will be hoping for the safety of everyone. However, I have a sneaking desire that at some point in your life you get falsely accused of a crime and locked up on Riker’s for awhile, as a friend of mine was. It might teach you a lesson, even if you don’t happen to be locked up there and abandoned by the city while a hurricane approaches.All that said: thanks to those who have provided actual information about the safety of the island; that’s reassuring. It doesn’t sound as if there’s much chance of a post-Katrina-like situation there.Be safe, all. And I mean all; no human being deserves to be treated as if they’re subhuman, no matter whether they’ve committed a heinous crime or posted an inhumane comment on a blog.ReplyCurious BobAugust 27, 2011 at 3:23 pmQuick question for everybody saying evacuate the jails on Rikers. Where are they supposed to take them? And how would they get them there? Unlike New Orleans these jails are high enough to be away from the surge and they will likely stay dry. Can many of the corrections officers that have to man the jails say the same?ReplyDianeAugust 27, 2011 at 3:18 pmnaturally you cant evacuate them. but some kind of measures should be taken to make sure everyone is safe .

I still remember the address of Rikers Island –1212 Hazen Street. I used to write to a prisoner. I grew up with quite a few young men who spent some time there. They did not deserve to die — and certainly not like this. This is not Alcatraz or Sing Sing, with more hardened criminals. How can we do this? How can the federal gov allow this under our Constitution?

Why should someone is serving a two year stint in Rikers be “upgraded” to defacto torture and possibly even death by drowning or being crushed under falling debris if he’s unlucky enough for a natural disaster to hit while serving his time?Why even have trials and juries in the first place to determine sentences?

As was pointed out a number of times, all the areas of NYC are zoned, and Riker’s Island is not in a zone that is in danger. The storm surge will not reach heights of 20′, and it sounds as if most of Riker’s is at or above that level. The most the waves will be hitting is 6′-8′. Also, landfill island would have bearing if we were talking earthquake (anyone freak out about them then? Probably not, and it sounds as if they were fine). Most of the people at Riker’s are not violent criminals, as has also been stated. It is used for pre-trail, teen detention, 1 year or less convictions and transport hub for criminals going to Sing-Sing or other such locations upstate. That means most of the people there are not there for violent crimes at all. Yes, we get that things like drugs and alcohol can kill, to whoever said that, but they are not violent, pre-meditated crimes, which makes them distinguishable from such crimes as rape and murder. Also, please go look up what this storm is and why people are actually afraid of it, all of you. It’s not that it is a hurricane, but rather that they aren’t sure of how fast, exactly, the winds will be when they hit NYC, potentially causing a fair amount of structural damage (though not to concrete jails, because they’re built to withstand worse), but the real fear, and why this storm is particularly bad, is because of the potential for flooding in low-lying areas, the main reason for evacuating Battery Park and Coney Island, but not Riker’s OR Roosevelt Island. This article, as well intended as it may have been, is very misleading and getting people upset for no reason. Should there be emergency plans in place on Riker’s if things get far far worse? Yes, and there probably are. The article, and a fair number of the readers here, have instead assumed that Mayor Bloomberg is just leaving them to die, when in reality there is no reason to evacuate them in the first place, because they are not in a low-lying area. One commentor had it correct when asking what about the homeless people? They’re the ones that are going to suffer because of a storm, as they have no where to go for shelter. Next time, before jumping to reactions, please look into it a bit.ReplygillianozAugust 27, 2011 at 1:43 pmDoes the Red Crossknow about this?

The recidivism rate in New York is as high as 65% and all the latest research has showed that treating people like animals (i.e. oppressing them, beating them, keeping them in lock down etc), no matter what they’ve done, increases their desire to become better criminals. When they get out of prison, with a criminal record they are already determined by society to be poverty-stricken… So, have the courage to open your minds and hearts to the fact that these are people you’re talking about with families, and personal struggles, just like you.for more information check out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RecidivismReplyDianeAugust 27, 2011 at 12:49 pmJust because these people did something they shouldnt have doesnt mean their not human.

Millions of people are in need of help and you are going to help the criminals? People are right — house them yourselves and see how far you get. Sure some may be innocent, but most are not. And comparing humans — any human — to “animals” is an insult to the nonhumans out there who are treated like sh*t by indifferent ignorant humans who self-indulge. You have a storm, not an armageddon.

So we don’t necessarily advocate calling the Mayor’s office now (as we know some readers are doing) and demanding Rikers be evacuated today. We understand that some inmates may be moved around on Rikers so that they are on higher ground — hopefully this will be enough to keep them, and the officers who guard them, safe. The point is that there SHOULD be an evacuation plan of some kind, just as there is for the rest of the city, and we hope people will make an issue of this after the immediate crisis has passed.ReplyAlex ZorachAugust 27, 2011 at 12:31 pmSome people seem to view and treat prisoners as sub-human.I believe otherwise.I believe all humans have innate worth, even those who have committed crimes, including heinous, evil crimes.And I believe in a justice system, not a punishment system.There is no justice in a prison where people are not protected from physical harm.The very foundation and philosophy of the justice system in America is a certain respect in our treatment of prisoners and also those accused of crimes.Part of this respect is an understanding that when people are punished with jail time, they are not punished in additional ways (i.e. torture, neglect, etc.) while they are in jail.Placing prisoners in jeopardy like this scenario here undermines the very foundation and values of the United State of America.All I can say now is, I just hope everyone on this island is okay–inmates, workers, convicted criminals, and those being held before trial–everyone.If anyone is harmed because of the hurricane, this will be a grave injustice.ReplyJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaAugust 27, 2011 at 12:41 pmThanks for this comment — we hope everyone reads it.ReplyAnika LawyerAugust 27, 2011 at 12:18 pmI’m sincerly saddened by this…prayers for the families of all those unable or unallowed to evacuate.

Which means a goodly number of people housed there are awaiting trial and have not been convicted of anything, were too broke to post bail, are serving a sentence for a misdemeanor or maybe, maybe have been convicted of a felony and are awaiting transfer to a prison.Child rapists and murderers? Hardly.I’d like to know more about the reasoning that went into the decision before I weigh in. Butbasically, when the state assumes custody of a person, it assumes responsibility for their safety and well-being, regardless of what a person did or is alleged to do.To my mind (and with no illusion that everyone at Riker’s is an upstanding citizen), our State’s duty to protect is greatest when it deprives people of liberty, not less.ReplyRobertAugust 27, 2011 at 12:10 pmIn New Orleans, the guards and staff evacuated and left the prisoners behind, including those not convicted, but held waiting for trial.There is good reason to believe that one entire floor was flooded to its ceiling, drowning every prisoner on that floor, and that this was covered up by falsifying prison records.ReplyCheaperAugust 27, 2011 at 11:44 amLet em drown, that’s 17,000 less people NY needs to pay to support.They broke the law and now Mother Nature is making the crime a little more serious.I just hope the jail buildings stay okay.As far as you people with kids in jail, nice parenting fail, maybe teach your kids how to stay within the confines of the law and they would not be in jail.Sucks for anyone who may be innocent, but welcome to life.ReplyArtAugust 27, 2011 at 11:40 amOn the other hand, it could be that they are moving them, but they don’t want anyone to know this.

It is no different than opening the cages of a zoo, and letting all the wild animals out to prey on the regular population.”Evactuating isn’t the same as setting free.(1) Think about cities in which almost everyone’s been given evacuation orders.These people are *already* free and if they stay in the city instead of leaving then they’re *not* evacuated.(2) Think about how prisoners get moved from one prison to another.Surely it’s possible for the Rikers inmates to be made inmates of somewhere inland instead of set free or left in the storm…ReplyCageAugust 27, 2011 at 10:17 amLet’s see…If you don’t choose to kill, rape, child-molest, devastate communities with drug and gang violence (and this only what they get caught doing)…then you get to be treated like a human….act like an animal get treated like one.ReplyEricaAugust 27, 2011 at 10:14 amI have just been reading a book about Argentina’s brutal military dictatorship and some of the comments here go a long way toward answering my question: how could ordinary people let that happen?How could people approve of a regime that “disappeared” people without trial and administered punishment far out of proportion to the crime?Some commenters here seem to think that people who’ve been arrested but not convicted, or people doing 6 months in jail due to possessing a tiny amount of weed, are basically equivalent to murderers and rapists and deserve to die.Wow.I don’t begin to understand these people, but I suspect the torturers and killers of Videla’s dictatorship would have.ReplyjurassicporkAugust 27, 2011 at 9:36 amSweet fucking Jesus, how I hate this country. I have never seen this country so mean-spirited and Michael Bloomberg only proves my long-standing theory that there’s no such thing as a former Republican.

And I don’t even live in NYC, anymore.ReplyCalifornia BobAugust 27, 2011 at 9:23 amDon’t really care.These people are criminals and as such, deserve to be left where they are. Actions have consequences.ReplyNat CaseAugust 27, 2011 at 8:54 amBe concerned about:1. the “tent”-like structures near the shore, especially on the west side.2. access to the island via the single causeway to Manhattan, which crosses the East River. Even though the LaGuardia runways almost touch the island and would provide a safer crossing for evacuation, there’s no access there.3. the lower floors of buildings build at 10-20 feet above sea level, and so presumably susceptible to flooding. Now, most structures have multiple stories, so it should be possible for most prisoners to ride out the storm on upper floors.Be less concerned about:1. comparisons to Katrina: the guards will be just as stuck on the island, (the parking lot is practically at sea level!), and we’re NOT going to see days of chest-deep flooding.2. Landfill: I’m really not sure what your concern is here. LAnd fill is ground we’ve moved, instead of land glaciers moved. It makes a difference when you’re talking about earthquakes, and maybe we’ll see more trees down on the island, but there aren’t that many trees there to begin with, and the buildings there will be as stable as most of those elsewhere in the 5 boros.And Mayor Bloomberg, what a lousy response. Least you could do is say, “Staff at Rikers Island have contingency plans for consolidating prisoners in safe locations, and will enact those if necessary.” I don’t know if its true, but I’d be very surprised. As recently as this spring, a bunch of prisoners had to be moved because of a fire. I’m thinking there are plans, somewhere.ReplyJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaAugust 27, 2011 at 12:21 pmSounds like you know the island well. Thanks for sharing this information.Replycharis mobloAugust 27, 2011 at 8:53 ami hardly think we see prisoners as less than human when they get three meals a day, dental, optical and health benefits that more than most hard working Americans cannot even afford for themselves let alone their families. Besides, prisons are built to withstand escapee,which seems they will have a far better chance to be unscathed. do you want that population in your neighborhood or in some Red Cross evacuation center w/ vulnerable people and children?ReplySunnieAugust 27, 2011 at 8:46 am@ Eliza S…you say “There is no need to move the prisoners on Riker’s Island, because it is not in the evacuation zone.

The prisoners will be fine, better than most I’d imagine. I am concerned for the homeless ppl who use tye transit tunnels for homes since they will be forced out I’m sure.Bloomberg didn’t handle the question well but can you blame him? Those ppl are in there for a reason.ReplyManiAugust 27, 2011 at 7:59 amThis surprises you all? Mayor Bloomberg has turned his back on the innocent animals being tortured and killed NEEDLESSLY at our local SHELTERS (and how dare they call them shelters…they are prisons) and you think he might protect prisoners? IN my opinion, these people need no protection when they had little respect for whoever’s innocent lives they destroyed to get themselves locked up. I for one have no sympathy for these horrible monsters when no one cares about their victims and all the other innocents that will suffer thru this storm…homeless people,,,stray animals….In my opinion, when they committed their crime they gave up their rights.ReplydonAugust 27, 2011 at 7:49 amAkin to a death sentence.

But nobody is suggesting these prisoners should be released to evacuate themselves. The most sensible option I can see is to load them up on buses (handcuffed, of course), get them to the main land, and take them to other prisons nearby that aren’t in the high risk areas. Not release them – that would be stupid – but don’t leave them there to die if everything goes to hell in a handbasket.Replyactivist bloombergAugust 27, 2011 at 6:32 amRikers Island IS NOT a maximum security prison. Its a jail. 75%-80% of inmates are there waiting trial because they can’t afford bail (fact). Meanning that at least 35%-40% are innocent and will be freed by the law. These inmmates are human being. Even the worst criminals as good Christians we should care and moved them to another jail not free them. There is enough time and enough money in NY state to relocate all inmmates but we prefer to pay wars and others. Remember we are not living in what is called DEMOCRATIC country (please do your political system researsh takes only 2mins online or its just common sense) we live in what is called a semi democratic country which means non direct where the PEOPLE has no power or word to say. We don’t directly vote for our president, we don’t vote for our laws, we can’t propose a law or go against a law ( true and correct facts) instead of voting for human rights laws such are protecting our peoples. They politicians votes for gay marriage which not necessary at all since we already have domestic partnership. And if we are true to our values and respect equality and justice for all them this law opens doors to poligamy and marrying our own grandfathers grandmothers nieces cousin dogs or tables. I hate killers, child molesters and other criminals they kill our society but I wouldn’t kill them because all of them on death row just want to die asap so let them not die and suffer in jail for the rest of their lives life in prison is a very good punishement good they don’t like it they wanna die if we killed them they suffer only for less than 60 second and its over. And I don’t support any type of killings but I do support tortue for killers and child molester and rapist. We live in the best country for opportunity so let’s take the opportunity to talk and stand. Don’t forget that we are the best nation on earth with the greatest peoples. For your information the peoples in rikers are safe including the guards who will work at least 2 shifts and will have to bed there. Irene is now only caterory 1 the walls there are way tall enough. They say don’t do the crime if u can’t do the time. I would say don’t do the crime cause its not worth the time.

I think this country is getting rotten lot faster than a decade before– to wish dead to those Citizens, who are majority NON violent, just waiting for a trail not having enough money (since all higher classes have them from their taxes!)-Bloomberg declared it’s most likely OK (?!) to dye for majority of 12000-17000 non violent juveniles, inmates-how many people died in WTC on 9/11..? and we all regret that but as humans we are NOT OK to let politics rules over more or less 12000+ lives to perish in 2 nearest days, because Mayor Bloomberg said it’d be OK!-other counties are accepted as 51st state of USA, but bring more of unknown violence etp – they were accepted to do what – more money to build stronger economy?! <<<<SEE IT FROM THAT ANGLE***.) Problem, that Mayor M. Bloomberg does NOT EVEN ATTEMPT to have ANY plan to evacuate a small Rickey's Island like one of the commentators – @KurtLove666 said above in a comment(…)"ANYONE arrested in the 5 boros of NYC can and usually does end up in Riker’s Island, regardless of the severity of their crime. And once convicted of a crime, they MUST be taken to an upstate facility WITHIN 7 DAYS OF BEING SENTENCED. If you take the time to research reality, 82% of arrests fail to end up getting convictions, and 75%+ of those convictions are misdemeanors. So there are a LOT of people on Riker’s that aren’t violent criminals, and there are a lot of people there that will not even get convicted of the crimes they are charged with.

There is no need to move the prisoners on Riker’s Island, because it is not in the evacuation zone. There is no problem here. Nobody in any zone 2 — which includes Rikers Island and many other areas — has to move. It’s considered sufficiently safe for all residents, prisoner or not. This is a made-up issue.

I’m not talking about the sick and pathological criminals, but the ones caught with a sack of weed, shoplifting expensive pair of tennis shoe’s cause their friends have one. A warden in Oklahoma once said, “We can’t make prisoners better against their will, but we sure as hell can make them worse”.

There are other islands in zone 2, such a Roosevelt Island, which are also not evacuating. The Mayor did not say that his administration would not evacuate Riker’s Island if the conditions grew dangerous enough to warrant it. The fact that Riker’s Island is not highlighted on the map does not indicate that it isn’t to be evacuated under any circumstances. Rather, it means it is not a residential place, with people freely living there that need to make the decision to stay or get out.ReplyBluefaeryglitterAugust 26, 2011 at 10:13 pmThere are juveniles there & people just waiting for trial that haven’t been convicted of anything at all.

Thank you, CWG, for your research, it makes me feel better. The person I know has never killed or raped anyone and would do better with a compassionate (but firm) rehabilitation program than being sent to criminal college (as he calls it) again and again to meet more partners in crime. I don’t pretend to know all of the answers, and I think it would take a massive movement to change the punitive system we have here in America, but it would be nice to know that people have taken the time to at least come up with some kind of evacuation plan. Maybe multiple-tiered leaving the most difficult (due to behavior, not medical issues) to be evacuated last. But that’s just my two cents.ReplyRisa DenenbergAugust 26, 2011 at 10:09 pmRikers Island is absolutely not a maximum security prison, as some ill-informed commentor stated above. It is a jail, which is a very different story. A jail does not house anyone convicted of a felony with a sentence of more than 12 months. Further, the vast majority of inmates are awaiting trial there because they can’t afford bail. Even if you harbor no compassion or have any care about inmates’ rights to safety, at least get your story right.ReplybillAugust 26, 2011 at 10:02 pmAs someone that has had family members in jails, i wouldnt evacuate them either.It is no different than opening the cages of a zoo, and letting all the wild animals out to prey on the regular population.They are there because they deserve to be there.And as someone that has been a victim of violent crime i can tell you this, the inmates have more rights than the people they victimize, i agree with bloomberg, let them drown, then we wont have to continue to pay for them.ReplyjillAugust 26, 2011 at 9:59 pmGranted many of the prisoners are there for a reason, they broke the law.

The bulk of the island is about 25′ above sea level, with the eastern part reaching heights of >60′. In a direct hit under a category 3 storm, the island would be at risk of 22′-24′ surges. While that’s not a great safety buffer, both the track of the storm taking it directly over the east river, and the strength of the storm maintaining cat. 3 winds that far up the coast are highly unlikely. That said, it’s very disturbing that the city does not have an island-wide evacuation plan as the unthinkable is (remotely) possible.ReplyJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaAugust 27, 2011 at 9:12 pmThank you for this valuable information!ReplydaveAugust 26, 2011 at 9:32 pmTHEY DESERVE TO DIE!ReplyLisaAugust 26, 2011 at 9:12 pmMy 16year old son sits on Rikers Island…with Juvinelle Diabeties and petrified that he will die on the hell hole Rikers island. When i called and spoke with a Rikers employee…she simply said “oh we good over here”. There is no love or concern for inmates …we have yet to be more outreaged about this and rise upReplyRoseAnne ClearyAugust 26, 2011 at 9:10 pmIf I had a son or daughter in prison as many mothers do, I would be filled with huge rage. I am an activist for abolishing capital punishment, partly on principle and partly because I have come to know someone on death row who is more full and whole a human being than many people I could name. But what hope is there for ackowledging the value of the life of a death row inmate in the light of a blatant affront like this?ReplyDesireeAugust 26, 2011 at 9:07 pmMay God protect those locked away. May God grant the mayor sense to move the prisoners out of harms way. God heal hearts, minds & spirits so that we may move in your righteous way & not look down at people because they are prisoners. But treat them like the human beings they are. Amen.ReplyMaura FrancisAugust 26, 2011 at 8:55 pmHe is the epitome of arrogance!ReplyLeft behind victim of murderAugust 26, 2011 at 8:42 pmAwww. Such a shame for the prisoners. So many people are standing up for them. Comparing them to being treated like animals. Poor, tough luck.They ARE mostly animals and there is one in side those walls I hope does drown in his own shit filled cell. Get a grip people. It’s RIKER’S ISLAND! The majority of people there are there because it is a MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON and they have done some thing so terrible that they belong there. It isn’t a vacation and it isn’t somewhere they put petty larceny or silly non violent criminals.It’s no wonder the country is going down the toilet with every one so soft and sad for the people who add to it’s destruction.ReplyLeft behind victim of murderAugust 26, 2011 at 8:25 pmAwww.Such a shame for the prisoners.So many people are standing up for them.Comparing them to being treated like animals.Poor, tough luck.They ARE mostly animals and there is one in side those walls I hope does drown in his own shit filled cell.Get a grip people.It’s RIKER’S ISLAND!The majority of people there are there because it is a MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON and they have done some thing so terrible that they belong there.It isn’t a vacation and it isn’t somewhere they put petty larceny or silly non violent criminals.It’s no wonder the country is going down the toilet with every one so soft and sad for the people who add to it’s destruction.ReplyPrison Reform MovementAugust 26, 2011 at 8:24 pmSo Bloomberg could in effect be giving these prisoners a death sentence….I am highly upset by this news. How dare he and what gives him the right??ReplyDeeAugust 26, 2011 at 8:11 pmI am reading all these comments worrying about the inmates and how inhumane this is, but not one comment about the correction officers. Did we forget that they will also be there? Did we forget that some of them will work double or triple shifts, because the city is shutting down public transportation at 12pm on Saturday. Yes, it is wrong to have no plan, but not just for the inmates, but also the men and women who work there. Maybe a little concern for them as well.Replyt.davisAugust 26, 2011 at 8:11 pmleave any convicted of rape,child abuse or murder…..remove the rest!!ReplyBrooke LoginAugust 26, 2011 at 8:04 pmWell I hope no one escapes from there then we have more problems than we can handle especially if that hurricane hits New York but I wish to believe in the best so lets believe that it won’t hit.Take precautions though anything can happenReplySisAugust 26, 2011 at 8:03 pmLets just let them all loose to run away,for their safety,of course.ReplyBubba JeffersonAugust 26, 2011 at 7:28 pmWe will sue them to death if anything happens to our loved ones.ReplyMelodyAugust 26, 2011 at 7:09 pmLawsuit in the making……….ReplyvoicesfromthecracksAugust 26, 2011 at 7:08 pmThank you for posting this.I have been sitting here wondering what is going to happy to inmates if Irene actually produces the chaos that people think it will.What happened after Katrina?To the inmates that suffered? Were they able to file suits against the prisons for leaving them?How is it possible that there is no legislation in place that protects inmates during events like this?I wish I could say this treatment shocks me.I wonder what advocates need to do in order to prevent situations like this from happening in the future.Getting legislation passed that protects inmates during natural disasters seems like a very important thing to add to the itinerary.ReplyMinervaAugust 26, 2011 at 7:07 pmInhumane.ReplysAugust 26, 2011 at 6:38 pmthis would never be an ethical or moral choice no matter the offense of the inmate, but in reality, the majority of those in prison have yet to even be convicted and are in fact awaiting trial. so no one can write off these pepole as scum or deserving of this fate.ReplyDonna HartAugust 26, 2011 at 6:07 pmThis is shocking, these people are still human.Treating them in this way is not a positive move forward for anyone involved in the correctional facilities, either prisoners or staff.The fear and anger that will be created will only exacerbate existing problems.ReplyCarmel GarciaAugust 26, 2011 at 6:06 pmThere is no end to the inhumanity of our nation.ReplyGingerAugust 26, 2011 at 6:06 pmThis is horrible and outrageous, but some how that doesn’t surprise me. People don’t consider prisoners any better than animals.My prayers are with everyone effected by this hurricane but especially those that are left locked up with no way of escaping what could be their deaths.ReplyEric FrancisAugust 26, 2011 at 6:04 pmI think that what we’re seeing is the state of mind necessary to keep people in prison at all.ReplyTaylorAugust 26, 2011 at 5:48 pmIt is sad to have to witness a public figure aggravatedly dismiss the interest in the welfare of those imprisoned. They have families and are citizens of this state. For our government to publicly acknowledge that there are people vulnerable to the catstrophe who could be killed if the impact is a bad as expected and do anything about it, is committing a crime as well. Mayor Bloomberg’s arrogance towardanother possible tragicexperiencemakes me wonder whose best interest does he really have in mind.ReplyCarol Van StrumAugust 26, 2011 at 5:43 pmThis is the standard response to prison hazards in a nation that regards prisoners as less than human and less deserving of care or respect than stray dogs.When an earthquake struck our local jail, cracking concrete walls and ceilings, the entire staff, guards and all, fled the building without a thought for the prisoners they left behind.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
