Both NCCC & Rikers Island jails has been sued by the DOJ for Patterns & Practices that violate the terms Rights of inmates.Each Consent Decree called for the implementation& installation of video cameras throughout the faciities with 100% coverage, new use of force policies & medical upgrades for treating prisoners. And for years_after theConsent Decrees had been implemented,nothing has changed in Nassau County Jailor Rikers Island jails because NCCC Sheriff’s Officer’s Association correctional union jail guards & COBA union guards failure to comply with the Federal Mandated Consent Decree Agreement Settlement terms that were signed to end Federal Civil Rights Abuse Violations Lawsuits filed by the (complict) DOJ. What is the purpose of suing a police department of correctional facility if the DOJ turns a blind eye to these offenders once the lawsuits are settled? Video is Cameras in police lock-ups, jails, jail medical wards, prisons, & police car/body-cam recordings don’t lie! So, how did five vulnerable women behind bars,in NCCC/NUMC get Raped & SexuallyAbused by the president of the Sheriff’s Officer’s Association correctional union,a k own repeat offender, Mark-“Institutional-Tree-Jumper”-Barber, the Fox Guarding the Hen House, who was promoted to head the Women’s Grievance Unit,in 2005, when FederalMonitor, Steve J.

District Attorney, Denis Dillon,Rice’s predecessor,& former N.C.Executive,Thomas Gulotta, Suozzi’s predecessor, were suppose to had been installed were suppose to protect these five (5) vulnerable women behind bars! The real question is ” what happenedto the mo ey that was suppose to had been spent purchasing & installing the video on cameras,with 100% coverage, would have protected these women, & other inmates/detainees,from Abuse & neglect in NCCC/NUMC? Who reallocated the funds, who knew_when, but dud nothing to blow the whistle on firmer Nassau County Executive,Tom-“$tick’em for the CREAM”-Suozzi’s failure to comply with the Federal Mandated CRT Reform Policy Agreement Settlement; signed by Suozzinin 2002 that ended the Federal Civil Rights Abuse Violations Lawsuits by the DOJ.
