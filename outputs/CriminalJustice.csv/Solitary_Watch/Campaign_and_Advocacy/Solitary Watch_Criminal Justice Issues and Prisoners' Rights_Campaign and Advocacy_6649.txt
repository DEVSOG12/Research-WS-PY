Bradley Ballard, 39, had initially been arrested for violating his parole and failing report to a change of address; while at Rikers he had been denied medication for diabetes and schizophrenia.• The New York Times profiled Ryan Speedo Green, who is currently playing Colline at New York City’s Metropolitan Opera production of “La Bohème.” As a child, Green spent two months in juvenile detention, including time in solitary confinement.• Rhode Island held its first-ever legislative commission to study the use of solitary confinement. The 19-member committee will report its finding to the state House of Representative early next year. “The state typically keeps about 300 inmates isolated in small cells, some for months or years,” according to the Associated Press.• The mother of a 22-year-old man who hanged himself in a New Mexico jail is suing the corporation that runs the facility as well as the company responsible for providing medical care. Evangeline Marquez alleges that her son, Michael Mattis, was held in solitary confinement for the entire duration on his time inside, five months, and she holds the GEO Group and Corizon Health responsible for his suicide.• Coverage of the national hunger strike continued.
