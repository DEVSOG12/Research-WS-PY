The death of Jean Jimenez-Joseph, 27, is supposedly being investigated by federal authorities. Trump has promised to detain more immigrants than ever before, and to relax protections for people inside immigration detention, including when it comes to the use of solitary.• New York Magazine published a story featuring the voices of four women who were held on Rikers Island. “I worked in the medical unit, and in the nursery,” said one woman. “While I was in the nursery, someone was crazy and tried to attack me. Any time you’re in an altercation, you get placed in solitary. I was in there for three months. You spend the time just trying to keep your sanity. I read books and tried to sleep.”• Business Insider published a video interviewer with a hacker, Kevin Mitnick, who spent eight months in solitary on the grounds that he might otherwise try to hack a North American missile defense system. “Imagine going into your home tonight, when you get out of school or out of the office, and locking yourself in your bathroom. And not leaving your bathroom for 23 out of 24 hours a day. And then for an hour a day, they give you a little bit more room, but you’re outside, you could look up at the sky. rIt’s pretty horrific. It takes a lot of time for the human to adapt to those conditions. But we can adapt to anything, right, eventually.”• Texas Public Radio published a segment on the continued use of isolation in the state’s prisons and jails. The questions they explore include, “Is the use of solitary confinement necessary to ensure maximum security, or are there safe, viable alternatives?

As the Omaha World-Herald reports, “Following a 10-year prison sentence —more than half of which he spent in solitary confinement — Jenkins was released July 30, 2013. Just before his departure, he had begged to be released to a mental health facility for what he claimed to be schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. Less than a month later, four people were dead.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Chelsea Manning,hacker,immigration detention,Jean Jimenez-Joseph,Kevin Mitnick,Nebraska,Nikko Jenkins,Rikers Island,Suicide,Texas,WomenAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
