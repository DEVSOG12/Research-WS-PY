The order includes those who recently signed requests that they not be revived [DNRs].”According to the AP, as many as 70 men are in dire condition and may be candidates for force-feeding. They will join the dozens of men at Guantanamo who have been fed for months via tubes forced through their noses and down their throats into their stomachs–a practice that is clearly in violation of international law.The state has chosen this course rather than negotiate seriously with the hunger strikers. California Corrections head Jeffrey Beard has called the 43-day strike a “gang power play,” although the former gang leaders are among the starving. Governor Jerry Brown stands silent. But presumably they are in agreement with the force-feeding strategy, which will prevent the strikers from becoming martyrs.Read the full wire service story here.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsActivism,California,California,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,force-feeding,Guantanamo,Human Rights,Jerry Brown,Lawsuits/Litigation,Pelican Bay,Politics of Punishment,Prison Hunger Strike,Solitary Confinement,Supermax Prisons,TortureJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Every person who remains quite partakes in the in the act, violates human rights. Every person who’s hands are actively involved, and continue, will one day find that they themselves have been robbed.ReplyBobAugust 21, 2013 at 7:45 pmIliam, “This is a pure act of protest, and should be noted as such.”That right there says it all, because as inmates, they shouldn’t have the right to protest.They lost that right when they committed their crime.They will regain that right once they have paid their debt to society and completed their sentence.If they are in for life, then they will never regain it. I’m sorry if that seems harsh or uncivilized to you, but these are harsh uncivilized people for the most part, otherwise they wouldn’t be in the situation they are in.Replyk kisselAugust 21, 2013 at 8:18 amThis is a historical event, that WILL go on record, making the government “our government” look worse than they already do? And good ol’ Gov jerry brown ain’t got nuthin’ to say? WOW? As I have stated many times, in many different places – ANIMAL CRUELTY GET’S MORE ATTENTION AND BETTER RESULTS!!!None of this is right! “A gang power play”, that is the best “the powers that be” can do? Man are they reachin’!!! Most of their top dawg “gang members”, are out?The gentlemen participating in the hunger strike are representatives of honor, integrity and most importantly humanity, they need to be given the common courtesy of even a simple negotiation! Not only are their rights as human beings being violated but their legal rights as well!ReplyliamAugust 21, 2013 at 1:22 amBob, Why do you assume their actions are without merit? Solitary confinement is considered by many doctors, psychologists and human rights attorneys as torture. We are a civilised society that should not condone torture, and this is these people who have been made almost entirely powerless, excercising what little power they have left as human beings. This is not bad behaviour, bad behaviour would be setting fire to things, vandalism. This is a pure act of protest, and should be noted as such.ReplyJake TrpstraAugust 20, 2013 at 10:29 pmCrueltyhas few boundaries, does it?ReplyBobAugust 20, 2013 at 12:52 am“The state has chosen this course rather than negotiate seriously with the hunger strikers. ”——————————————————————————————————There is nothing to negotiate and therefore no choice.Negotiation would only reward and give merit to their actions, and that would only serve to encourage more bad behavior.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
