Youth Authority leaders testified in favor of the bill, stating they already avoid using isolation as a disciplinary technique. “Isolation continues to be used for other reasons (besides discipline) – for example, if a youth needs a quiet place to regain self-control or regulate their emotions,” clarified Sarah Evans, deputy communications manager for the Youth Authority.•  A proposed bill in Minnesota would prohibit the use of solitary confinement as punishment for nonviolent disciplinary offenses, prevent people from being released straight from solitary, and ban the placement of people with mental illness in the box. “There is no law at all about solitary confinement in Minnesota, which seems odd,” said John Stuart, criminal justice consultant for Minnesota’s National Alliance on Mental Illness chapter. “We have law about chickens. We have law about roller-skating. But something that is so important in a person’s life, there’s no law.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags3rd Circuit,7D,7D2,Cory Booker,Death Row,juvenile facilities,MERCY Act,Minnesota,New Mexico,NYDOCCS,Oregon,Pennsylvania,Rand Paul,Rhode IslandAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
