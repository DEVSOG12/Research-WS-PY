If I am allowed to use the unit phone, I have to use it in my cell. I am not allowed to go to the law library, gym, or anywhere else inmates congregate. The conditions on the MCU unit (Management Control Unit) is one that can only be described as bleak, hopeless, and explosive.”• The Colorado Independent published an in-depth analysis of last week’s federal ruling in Thomas Silverstein v. Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Silverstein, 62, has been held in complete isolation for 31 years – longer than any other federal prisoner.  The journalist quotes from an article posted last week on Solitary Watch by the site’s editors, Jean Casella and James Ridgeway.  Artwork made by Silverstein and his accounts of his conditions in solitary are also incorporated into the piece.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,James Ninete Leon Guerrero,Lester Alford,Loni Hancock,New Jersey,Sarah Shourd,Solitary Confinement,Thomas Silverstein,women in prisonAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
