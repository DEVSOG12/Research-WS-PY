The father of Adel Daoud said that his son’s mental health issues began when at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where Daoud was held in solitary confinement for almost four years awaiting trial.• The Marshall Project revisited the demands made by prisoners during the uprising at Attica prison, and how many promises have never been fulfilled – including instituting a 30-day maximum for segregation. “Though there are limits for first-time offenders in the general population, inmates can still spend years, even decades, in solitary,” notes the site.• According to ThinkProgress, nearly half of juvenile centers use isolation as a form of control. “The experience [of solitary] is traumatic and depressing and can have an enormous impact on kids’ mental health,” said Mark Soler, executive director for the Center for Children’s Law and Policy.• The DC Court of Appeals has reinstated a lawsuit challenging the Bureau of Prisons’ Communications Management Units, which hold a predominately Muslim population in small-group isolation with limited access to the outside world. “However, the district court ruled that prisoners had no ‘liberty interest’ in avoiding placement in a CMU – and thus did not need to receive any process at all before being sent to one – despite the severe communications restrictions, stigma, and years-long segregation that come with such placement,” according to the Center for Constitutional Rights.• A federal judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a teenager and his mother, which alleges that the young man was wrongfully held in solitary confinement at the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center in Tennessee. Sharieka Frazier says he was held in 23-hour isolation with no books or other materials, and that even “his cell window was covered with a board for a period of time”• Family members are suing the South Carolina Department of Corrections after their son died while in solitary confinement from an untreated kidney infection. Victor Rogers, 27, had “decompensated” in the box after also being denied treatment for his mental health issues. “While housed at Evans [Correctional Institution], Victor was noted as being catatonic,” the lawsuit said. “He defecated and urinated on his food trays.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Adel Daoud,Attica uprising,Chicago,Communication Management Units,Illinois,juvenile detention,Metropolitan Correctional Center,Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center,South Carolina Department of Corrections,Supreme Court,Tennessee,terrorism,Victor RogersAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
