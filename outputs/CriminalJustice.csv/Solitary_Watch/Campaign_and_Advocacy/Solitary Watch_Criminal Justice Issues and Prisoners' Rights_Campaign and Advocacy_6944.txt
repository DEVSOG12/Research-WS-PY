And sadly, it seems, that unless you are at first hands involvement and it happens to one of your own or close to it, the general public, the masses, do not know? And people NEED TO KNOW!!! No one would condone solitary confinement and I mean NOBODY! It must be stopped and stopped IMMEDIATELY!!!And EVERYONE needs to HELP!Let us do what we may, to stop this in harmony and blatant violation of human rights?ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
