The message was most clear: ‘Your safety is not hardly our priority.’ I thought aloud: ‘Our lives don’t mean sh–!’”• PBS has released a preview of its upcoming investigation into solitary confinement, entitled “Solitary Nation.”• California has opened public response period for the proposed Security Threat Group / Step Down Program.  These regulations will govern how individuals are placed into and released from California’s Secure Housing Units.• A US Army veteran currently imprisoned at an immigration detention center in Washington state told Democracy Now that he has been placed in solitary confinement in retaliation for his activism on the inside.  His letter calling for a work stoppage was intercepted by staff.  Truth-Out reported that several detainees on a hunger strike at the Joe Corley Detention Facility in Conroe, Texas endured similarly retaliatory measures.• Virginia’s Attorney General Mark Herring is seeking to overturn a recent court ruling in which the procedures governing conditions on confinement on death row were found to be unconstitutional.  Last fall, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema found that Virginia had violated the due process rights of the condemned by placing them in solitary confinement solely on the basis of their sentence.  [Solitary Watch previously reported on Judge Brinkema’s ruling here.]ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Death Row,immigration detention,Jason Echevarria,Solitary Confinement,Terrence Pendergrass,VirginiaAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
