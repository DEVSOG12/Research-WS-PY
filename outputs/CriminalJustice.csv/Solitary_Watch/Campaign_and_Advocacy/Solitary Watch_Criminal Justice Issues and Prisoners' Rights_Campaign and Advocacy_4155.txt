Robert Hinton, then 27, was beaten by the guards after he refused to be escorted to a now-closed isolation unit for prisoners with mental illness.• Scott Frakes, currently the deputy prisons director in Washington state, will next serve as Nebraska’s corrections commissioner. Over the course of Frakes’ tenure in Washington, the state decreased the use of solitary confinement by 35 percent.• Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe signed a conditional pardon for Reginald “Neli” Latson, a man diagnosed with autism who had been in solitary confinement for more than a year. Latson will now be moved to a residential facility.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Marichuy Gamino,Nebraska,Reginald Latson,Rikers Island,Solitary ConfinementAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
