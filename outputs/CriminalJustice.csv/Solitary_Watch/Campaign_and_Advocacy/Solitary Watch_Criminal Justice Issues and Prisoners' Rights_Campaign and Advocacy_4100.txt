Brown suit between the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of individuals in solitary confinement at Pelican Bay State Prison, terms of 10 years or more, which have been common in California, will be virtually eliminated, as will solitary sentences of indeterminate length.“Today is a historic day,” declared Jules Lobel, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, on Tuesday morning.Filed in May 2012, Ashker v. Brown reached class action status in 2014, representing all men held at Pelican Bay State Prison in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) for over a decade. Arguing that long-term isolation violated the Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, and that the lack of meaningful review of SHU placement violated due process rights, the case was set for trial in December.Through the terms of the agreement, individuals will no longer be placed in the SHU for gang affiliation; with limited exceptions all prisoners currently held in the SHU for over 10 years will be released to general population; and all SHU terms would be finite rather than indeterminate.“This settlement represents a monumental victory for prisoners and an important step toward our goal of ending solitary confinement in California, and across the country,” the plaintiffs said in a joint statement.  “California’s agreement to abandon indeterminate SHU confinement based on gang affiliation demonstrates the power of unity and collective action.  This victory was achieved by the efforts of people in prison, their families and loved ones, lawyers, and outside supporters.”“The department was headed this way, anyway,” said CDCR Secretary Jeffrey Beard.Under the terms of the agreement,  the only way anyone will be able to get in the SHU is if they commit an offense carrying that punishment, including assault and murder. If that offense is tied to gang activity, and if the offender is a validated prisoner, after the completion of a determinate SHU-term for the offense, they will be placed in the Step Down Program (SDP). Under the terms of this agreement, the SDP, which has been operational for two years, will be reduced from three to four years, to two years.Individuals who refuse to participate in the SDP will be placed in a new Restrictive Custody General Population Housing Unit. According to Mr. Lobel, the new unit “will not be solitary, but a highly secured facility” that allows small-group recreation, programming, work assignments and contact visits.Also eligible for placement in the new unit will be individuals who have been in the SHU for 10 or more years who have recently committed a SHU-able offense and individuals who cannot be released to general population due to threats to their safety.The department will have to review all individuals in the SHU within the next year.“As the plaintiffs recognize this is a step towards the larger goal of the prisoners human rights movement,” said Carol Strickman, staff attorney at Legal Services for Prisoners with Children.There are currently about 2,000 individuals in SHUs across the state, at Pelican Bay State Prison, Tehachapi State Prison, Corcoran State Prison, and California State Prison in Sacramento who will be impacted.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsActivism,alternatives,Ashker v.

Many prisoners use cockroaches or rats as pets.I spent 8months in solitary. It was torture because I did not have a bible orinstrument.I was already a strong believer – anintercessor and lifelong musician. Everyone in jails hears voices.I knew they were God and demonsThe task was to decide who was who.MOST prisoners think they are hallucinatingwhen they hear voices.And the atheistpsych people who talk to them tell them this too. THEN they think they needpsych drugs for the alleged hallucinations. They get all distressed cos theycant get the drugs, when the drugs is NOT what they need. They turn people intovegetables. They block all thoughts, not just bad thoughts They cause braindamage I was on them so I know. They HINDER prayer.They are not what people need .People need tobe TOLD they are NOT hallucinating that God is there for them and to develop arelationship with HIM by reading a bible and playing music.I havemasters in jazz composition In music school people go into small rooms the sizeof cells, often, with their instrument, It is nothell like jail – it is more like heaven.Hence we can turn solitary into an experiencethat a person should have had before they ended up in jail.A chance to be in music school.This is a blessing. They will come out ofthere trained to be a minister to others – in jails, in schools, warning kidsnot to use drugs, join gangs, etc and ministers.The otherimportant issue is to erase criminal records. THEy are what ruin people’s livesbecause what is written down acts like curses and sends assignments to a personwhere they get re-accused in all kinds of bizarre situations and ruins theirlives. And it also tempts people to re-do sins and criminal behaviors.Prisonshould be a time outSolitary does nothave to be torture. though it should be used in a way where people have theirown cell and come out for communal meals, to compare notes about prayer.Psych drugsdestroy people. They are the problem, not the solution. They cause suicide andhomicide. The Governors need to give people an amnesty by executive orders –overriding their previous sentence.Regardlessof the previous sentence, it could be that they need to spend no more than ayear or two training for ministry – reading the bible, learning how to pray.Their jobcan include writing a memoir of what happened to them so others can understandit and learn from it. Especially for people on death row.People makemistakes in life. It is part of life .To punish people for this makes no sense.We should be interested in transforming them and using their previousexperience as part of their testimony to what Jesus has healed them from and towarn others about not doing.The worstcriminals have the most powerfull testimonies. So their mistakes are notwasted. They are valuable testimonies to others of the transformative power ofGod/Jesus.Someone who was a massmurderer has a more impressive testimony than someone who stole gum.The jailsentence should be seen as a time out for assessment of a person’s attitude andbehavior and training to change it.One thingthat would be effective would be part of their sentence would be to have theperson write 50,000 times “Drugs are a bad idea” if they used drugs,for example.Doing this will re-programtheir brain NOT to want to do drugs!Orwhatever they did before.Like when kidshave to write on the blackboard.We shoulduse school as a model for what happens in jails.Life is School. Re training rather thanpunishment should be the objective.Turningsomeone from an animal into a caring human being is a more inspiring testimonythan just executing people or punishing them.Those whoare unwilling to forgive need to be warned – it can send a person to hell.That is what solitary is like as a warningthat hell is real.Every person near mehad been horribly abused and needed to forgive. They were there as a warning todo so or go to hell, which is what jail was a taste of.jesus saidunless we forgive others, God won’t forgive us.Matthew 6Hell isreal.Jails, solitary, psych wards,holocausts and wars all exist as a taste of it on earth, so we WILL believethere IS such a real place. That is their purpose.but itdoesn’t need to be for 20 years.Experiencing it for a week is enough to get the message.DavidBerkowitz the Son of Sam is one such person.He has been saved 25 years. Gov Cuomo should pardon him and ask him tocome to Rikers and help transform the place.He should RUN for office because the PUBLIC needs to hear about thetransformative power of Jesus. Especially the Jews. They do not realizethis.And he is Jewish. Many Jews whocommit crimes endup in psych wards andare not helped that way.seearticles, free books, musichttp://www.1prophetspeaks.comsee ARTICLESby CATEGORY pageArticles inalphabetical order pagehttp://www.1prophetspeaks7.blogspot.comarticles in most recent orderRemedy forRikershttp://www.1prophetspeaks7.blogspot.com/2015/06/remedy-for-rikers.htmlSpiritualBootcamp – my experience in solitary launching prayershttp://www.1prophetspeaks7.blogspot.com/2014/02/spiritual-bootcamp-my-experience-in.htmlReplySharron GrodzinskySeptember 11, 2015 at 12:01 pmFinally, some common sense and some relief.This still needs work as there are thousands more sitting in solitary in other parts of the country.ReplyNil_DarpsSeptember 2, 2015 at 1:20 pmYou write:1)“With limited exceptions all prisoners currently held in the SHU for over 10 years will be released to general population.”Well that didn’t work out very well for Hugo Pinell who was just killed in less than a month in GP.2) “If the offender is a validated prisoner, after the completion of a determinate SHU-term for the offense, they will be placed in the Step Down Program (SDP).”Since this entails giving a detailed list of the prisoner’s activities within the STG a bona fide member will refuse.3) “Individuals who refuse to participate in the SDP will be placed in a new Restrictive Custody General Population Housing Unit (RCGPHU). According to Mr. Lobel, the new unit “will not be solitary, but a highly secured facility” that allows small-group recreation, programming, work assignments and contact visits. Also eligible for placement in the new unit will be individualswho have been in the SHU for 10 or more years who have recently committed a SHU-able offense and individuals who cannot be released to general population due to threats to their safety.”One can surmise (or at least hope) from these three facts that any warring STGs will not be housed together in the RCGPHU so the final result may well be that the most hardcore members of a given STG will be concentrated in one unit where it would be easier for them to collaborate.So I guess in the end it will be up to the STG members what the final outcome of this new system will be.I doubt that those in charge have not thought all this through and are waiting for such results as the Pinell killing to clamp down even harder.ReplyWe HobsonSeptember 1, 2015 at 7:02 pmFor shame. They had to go to court to bring an end to this form of torture!ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
