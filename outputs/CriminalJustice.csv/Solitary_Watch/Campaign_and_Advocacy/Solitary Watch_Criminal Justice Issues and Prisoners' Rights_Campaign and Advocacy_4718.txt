I am doing research on the placement and treatment of juveniles in America and the facilities that house, treat, and assist them.I have visited these “troubled-teen” facilities across the United States and have taken photographs of the spaces that the children live in, work in, and study in. I have made sure to keep the children’s identities unknown, by either photographing them from behind or obscuring their faces.I am not working with an agenda, but am simply recording what exists.To date, I have photographed Angel’s Flight (L.A.), group homes, foster homes, ICE juvenile holding, Los Prietos Boys Camp, LAPD, SFPD, EL Paso PD, Ventura Youth Correctional Facility, Santa Barbara Juvenile Correctional facility, Sexual Assault Response Team Examination Rooms, interview and exam rooms for sexually abused children, juvenile courtrooms, high schools, Children of the Night (Van Nuys), JHS, Montessori classrooms, Maryvale (a former orphanage), CPS interview rooms, El Paso Juvenile Courtrooms, half-way houses, reform schools, maximum security Giddings, TX, lock-down and nonlock-down shelters, SW Keys, ORR, ICE, DHS, and CBP to name a few. I have primarily focused on kids that are not the “Kids R Us” type of juvenile, but rather minors that become part of a system because they have failed, or their families have failed them, or their society has failed them. Earl Dunlap, the Director of Cooke County Detention Center, welcomed me to his facility with the words: “Welcome to the gates of hell.”…This body of work will culminate in a book, website, lecture and collection of essays to be published in 2011. The work was done with partial support from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Annie E. Casey Foundation.Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles, CaliforniaVentura Youth Correctional Facility, Ventura, CaliforniaSuicide Practice Dummy, Fairbanks Youth Facility, Fairbanks, AlaskaIn several videos on the Aperture Foundation’s web site, Ross talks about his previous project, The Architecture of Authority, which the site describes as “unsettling pictures of architectural spaces that each exert a kind of power over the individual. From a Montessori preschool to churches and mosques, to an interrogation room at Guantánamo and segregation cells at Abu Ghraib, Ross’s photographs reflect the state of our post 9/11 world—one in which he believes the public has become accustomed to the abuse of power, erosion of individual liberty, illegitimate authority, and constant surveillance.” Ross’s new project shows just how adept this world has become in inventing ways to lock down its children.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCorrections Industry,juvenile detention,Juveniles,photography,Richard Ross,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,Suitable PlacementJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

He accidentaly shot his sister and the D.A. didn’t care that my son had been menatally abused by his dad and that the psychologist that the court first employed didn’t lean toward the D.A. so they got a referral from the JDCchairman where my son was being held at and the person the JDC chairman reffered ALWAYS leaned in favor of the D.A.The first psychologist said my son has a list of 12 or more mental disorders and the other psychologist played patty cakes with her eyes with the D.A. Everyone saw it. It was not a hearing it was a farce. No one was concerned about my son not even the public defender my son had, it seemed.Basically, if you don’t have money for a lawyer YOU ARE GOING TO PRISON. Not getting help. My sons dad who caused all this is still walking free. They even let him see my son in JDC and my son said his dad tried to convince him, my son, that he didn’t see what he thought he saw.ReplyAllathaMarch 28, 2011 at 12:48 amI am trying to contact Susannah, the pserson who said they are a juvenile defense attorney. I was incarcerated at Ventura Girls school and I can help you with a story. I need help.ReplySusannahJanuary 22, 2011 at 12:25 amThank you for sharing your very powerful photos. You may not have an agenda, but I do. I am a juvenile defense attorney working within the confines of a in a broken system. The statutory aim of these facilities is in part to rehabilitate. Clearly, that has failed miserably. Please email me. I am working with local and state officials on the issue of juvenile (in)justice and would like to use some of your photos.ReplyJim ZincAugust 20, 2010 at 11:49 amWell Marie, your right about the hatred and contempt about being a child prisoner produces. I was 15 years old when I got throwed into a jail cell in Paducah, Kentucky for being a“runaway”.A cellfilled with human waste 2 inches deep and fed food a pig wouldn’t even touch.Here it is 38 years later and I’m still seething.And that hatred and contempt for the goverment grows and grows.ReplyMaree GilesAugust 18, 2010 at 6:47 amIt’s unbelievable to think children are being incarcerated and abused this way in 2010. The American government should be ashamed of itself. The British government, ditto. No wonder there is so much violence, resentment, hatred and chaos when children are neglected and abused. It is inevitable that they grow into damaged adults who can’t find their place in the world. Stability, love, kindness, all this is absent in these jails for children. There is another way, but it is up to the government to make these changes and offer hope. It is too easy to simply lock them up and punish them.ReplyAlan CYA#65085August 11, 2010 at 2:30 pmHere is another series. First shot of boy in solitary with a caption on solitude and the second is a girl with a Life Without Parole Sentence with her words as she realizes just what that means. Sad, sad sad! There are some 22 more pics in this series that you can flip through.http://www.araoshagan.com/Pages/Juvies/Juvies17.htmlhttp://www.araoshagan.com/Pages/Juvies/Juvies19.htmlReplyjuliannaJuly 3, 2010 at 5:37 pmlooking at thesepicturesreally makes me sad . just knowing howunfortunatelyother kids have been trough worse things in life,makes me appreciate life more.To all of those people who have been sent to these horrible facilitiesi give them all of my respect because weather they were placed for their behavior,, or justany difficult differences. All of those places forexample “PROVO CANYON SCHOOL IN UTAH” should be shut down !!!!!! I really want to encourage kids that are placed in these facilities to speak out and not stay quiet when they are beingabused , disrespectedtortured ,discriminated, or all the other fucked up shit they do. BE A SURVIVORReplyPandaJune 14, 2010 at 7:56 pmHave you photographed any places in Utah?My boyfriend’s at Provo Canyon School, and Im really worried.I dont trust lockdown facilities whatsoever.Or the teen help system in general.ReplylisaMay 30, 2010 at 3:51 pmIs this for fosterchildren who have disbehavedReplyNatalieMay 30, 2010 at 2:53 pmPowerful photos.
