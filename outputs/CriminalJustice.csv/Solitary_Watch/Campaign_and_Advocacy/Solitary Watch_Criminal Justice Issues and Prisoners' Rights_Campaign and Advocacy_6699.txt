The book, which is edited by Solitary Watch’s Jean Casella, Jim Ridgeway and Sarah Shourd, is the first to feature firsthand accounts of life in solitary.• Taylor Pendergrass of the New York Civil Liberties Union responded to Norman Seabrook’s recent column, in which Seabrook criticized Obama’s recent comments on solitary confinement. “Corrections officers, who work difficult jobs — often without adequate recognition or pay — deserve representatives who have the vision to embrace changes like solitary confinement reform that will benefit their members,” wrote Pendergrass.• Nutraloaf has been banned in Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, but is still being served to people in solitary confinement in Florida if they are perceived to pose a security threat. Justifying the continued use of Nutraloaf, one Florida DOC official said, “If [an inmate] is endangering the safety of our staff, we take that very seriously.”• The New York Daily News examined how New York manages and houses incarcerated trans people. “According to DOCCS, 10.8% of trans prisoners are in SHU and 2.4% are in protective custody,” they report.• Lake County Jail in Indiana made changes with regards to the use of solitary long before the recent settlement at the state level, including by creating a “cutting-edge mental health wing” in a new building. “The way it was before, it was deplorable.

They’ve got mental health issues when they come through our door, and we exacerbate their problem,” he said.• Texas is looking to further reduce the number of people held in solitary confinement by providing specialized treatment for those with mental illness, according to an article on Chron. “Under a new initiative that officials say has proven successful so far, the goal is to improve the offenders’ mental health enough to return them to regular cellblocks instead of isolation cells known as ‘administrative segregation.’”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,California,Chelsea Manning,children in solitary confinement,Florida,Georgia,Hell Is a Very Small Place,Indiana,Lake County Jail,Mental Illness,New York,Nutraloaf,Salt Lake County Jail,Texas,transgenderAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
