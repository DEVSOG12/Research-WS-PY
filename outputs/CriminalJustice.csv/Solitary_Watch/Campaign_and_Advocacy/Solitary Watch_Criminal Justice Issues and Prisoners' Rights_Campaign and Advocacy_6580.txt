The board claims that a section of the California Public Safety Officers Bill of Rights prevents punitive action against officers if the investigation doesn’t meet a one year deadline. Others dispute this interpretation and argue that the dismissals allow officers to operate with impunity and will lead to more deaths in the future. Under investigation were cases resulting in serious lawsuits against the county for officer misconduct or negligent mental health care in the detention facilities, including the suicide of a father of three who had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness, one day after he was placed in solitary confinement. Former San Jose police auditor Barbara Attard commented, “To just wholesale close cases, I’ve never seen an agency do that.”• The Marshall Project, in collaboration with VICE, published the writing of Dwayne Hurd, who is serving a sentence of 32 years to life for second degree murder.

While she was allegedly isolated for her own protection, Murillo said that more than a year in solitary had left lasting effects on her personality and psyche. California Congress Member Tony Cárdenas has introduced the Protecting Youth from Solitary Confinement Act (H.R. 1926) in an attempt to solidify a federal ban on youth solitary put in place by President Obama, and worries about the ultimate fate of the resolution in the hands of Donald Trump. “We need to stop being the only [member country of the United Nations] that does solitary for minors,” Cárdenas said. Obama’s directive is limited to federal prisons, and would not affect state prisons and local jails like the one where Jaki Murillo was held in isolation.• According to TXK Today, Billy Joel Tracy, a man imprisoned in Texas for assault and burglary, now faces a potential death sentence for the killing a correctional officer at the Barry Telford Unit in New Boston, Texas.
