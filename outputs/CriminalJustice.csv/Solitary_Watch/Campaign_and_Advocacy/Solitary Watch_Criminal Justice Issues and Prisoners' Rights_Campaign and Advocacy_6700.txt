He describes what one young man, Mahdi Hashi, has experienced there: “For over three years, [Hashi] has been confined to a small cell 23 hours a day without natural light, with an hour alone in a slightly larger indoor cage. He has had no physical contact with anyone.”• Slate published a video featuring two men who were released after spending long periods of in solitary. They “describe what it’s like to spend months, and even years, in extreme isolation, and how hard it has been for them to recover since they regained their freedom.”• An article in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health explores “The “Clinical Alternative to Punitive Segregation” (CAPS) Program in New York City Jails.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,ADX Florence,Anthony Hinton,Five Mualimm-ak,Mahdi Hashi,Maine,Mental Illness,Metropolitan Correctional Center,Norman Seabrook,Tommy SilversteinAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
