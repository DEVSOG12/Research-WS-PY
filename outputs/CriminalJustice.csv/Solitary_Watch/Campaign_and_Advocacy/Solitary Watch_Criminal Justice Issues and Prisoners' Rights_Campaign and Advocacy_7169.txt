Del. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington), who is leading the effort, said he will urge the General Assembly to study ways to limit the use of solitary confinement and offer more treatment before inmates are released.The story does a good job of explaining how solitary confinement became common practice in Virginia–and throughout the United States. Factors include the explosion in sentencing–and with it the boom in prison building–as well as the increasing criminalization of the mentally ill.Although solitary confinement has long been a tool of prison discipline (and a staple of pop culture depictions of prison life), the use of solitary became increasingly common in the 1980s and 1990s. Since then, many legal and medical experts have argued that inmates in isolation for long periods suffer from higher suicide rates, increased depression, decreased brain function and hallucinations…Virginia opened Red Onion — deep in coal country and about 400 miles from Richmond — a dozen years ago as part of a major prison-building effort after the abolishment of parole and the lengthening of prison sentences. Like many other supermax prisons, Red Onion was designed to confine — but not necessarily rehabilitate — the most-dangerous criminals.As of October, 505 of 745 inmates at Red Onion were in solitary, according to the state. When legislators toured Red Onion on Sept. 1, prison officials told them that 173 inmates in solitary there were considered mentally ill.State officials said they do not keep statistics on the length of isolation stays, but they told Hope in a recent memo that Red Onion inmates have been isolated from two weeks to almost seven years, with an average stay of 2.7 years.Unsurprisingly, Post reporter Anita Kumar encountered resistance and obfuscation when she sought information for the story: “Virginia officials were reluctant to answer questions from The Washington Post about the practice of solitary confinement. In some instances, they provided contradictory information to The Post and legislators; at other times, they declined to talk about the use of solitary confinement.”Read the full article here.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCorrections Industry,Lawsuits/Litigation,Legislation,Mental Illness,Psychological Effects,Red Onion Prison,Sentencing,Solitary Confinement,Supermax Prisons,Virginia,Washington PostJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

I don’t advocate abolishing it as it is needed for some convicts that give the state no choice but to lock them up to keep staff & other inmates safe, or to keep the convict from escaping. I don’t doubt that it’s over-used & that in many cases there’s other alternatives to discipline of unruly inmates than long-term solitary confinement.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)January 9, 2012 at 4:49 pmSolitary Confinement is disquished as “administrative segregation” and never called solitary confinment by those in charge of the prisons. It’s not a politically correct phrase and they will deny the existence by merely using words that alter the meaning but say the same thing = the hole….Been there and done that PR stuff to avoid too much digging by the media… Code of Silence is strong when it comes to this practice as is the practice itself.. Keep digging and you will find abuse, neglect and mentally ill persons suffering under this most restrictive housing method widely used by all states whether they admit it or not..ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
