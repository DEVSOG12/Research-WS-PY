You can listen to the interview here: http://www.hereandnow.org/2010/12/30/mississippi-sister-robbery.Our original story on the Scott sisters–one of the first to appear–can be found here:  https://solitarywatch.org/about/for-jamie-scott-an-11-robbery-in-mississippi-may-carry-a-death-sentence/. Our thoughts on the reasons why Haley Barbour might consider pardoning the sisters appears in this follow-up story: https://solitarywatch.org/2010/09/22/a-chance-at-freedom-for-the-scott-sisters/.The release is controversial because of the provision that Gladys donate a kidney to her sister Jamie as a condition of release. None of this, however, has dampened the joy of their mother, Evelyn Rasco, whose posts can be found on this Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_174775012538129&id=188210824527881&bcode=i24xm.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesTagsGladys Scott,Haley Barbour,Jamie Scott,Media,Mississippi,Prison Health Care,Scott sistersJean CasellaJean Casella is the director of Solitary Watch.
