Supporters include Venida Brower, whose son Kalief committed suicide after spending time in isolation on Rikers Island as a teenager.• New York’s Mayor Bill De Blasio announced that the number of people held in solitary has dropped by since 2/3 since Department of Corrections Commissioner Joseph Ponte took office – from 563 in April 2014 to 167 on April 1, 2016. “For far too long, punitive segregation was used as a convenient discipline rather than a last resort,” said De Blasio.• The Santa Fe New Mexican published in an-depth investigation into Corizon, the nation’s largest for-profit provider of health services for people in prison, which has been frequently sued for providing negligent and delayed care. Danny Tavasci, 54, committed suicide in solitary confinement in a Corizon-run facility in 2014; guards found a “virtual drugstore” in his cell, “despite his disciplinary history of abusing them.”• Nebraska Corrections Director Scott Frakes was asked by lawmakers about progress in reducing the use of solitary and ensuring that people are not released directly from isolation. State Senator Ernie Chambers told Frakes he was not doing enough to ensure that a high-profile and mentally ill prisoner, Nikko Jenkins, was not being passed sharp objects by corrections officers.• Jahmal Lightfoot, who was incarcerated at Rikers Island, testified in court that jail staff “savagely beat him” and placed him in solitary for 110 days after falsely accusing him of charging at them with a razor.
