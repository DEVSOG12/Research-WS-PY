Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.She said the actions of prosecutors under the control of Connick, who left office in 2003 and is the father of the famous singer of the same name, “dishonored” the obligation to turn over evidence favorable to the accused established in Brady v. Maryland nearly 50 years ago.Ginsburg also wrote that “Connick’s deliberately indifferent attitude created a tinderbox in which Brady violations were nigh inevitable.” As we wrote in October, many other convictions have also been overturned, “all due to suppression of evidence,” said New Orleans Defense Attorney Nick Trenticosta. “They all try to portray it as rogue prosecutor; a fluke,” he continues, but “Harry Connick used to give awards to prosecutors for successfully convicting people.”Connick, Trenticosta said, created a culture where convictions were won “at any cost.” The office’s zeal for sending people to death row was such that a New Orleans prosecutor kept on his desk a model electric chair holding photos of five condemned men–John Thompson among them. Trenticosta has called the prosectors’ actions “calculated measures to take people’s lives away.”Findings by the Innocence Project of New Orleans back up this assessment. In a 2008 report, the Project reviewed the record of Connick’s 28-year-tenure, and found that the practice of suppressing evidence was so prevalent that it could be called “a legacy in New Orleans.”According to available records, favorable evidence was withheld from 9 of the 36 (25%) men sentenced to death in Orleans Parish from 1973-2002. Four of those men were eventually exonerated, having been released only after serving a collective 43 years on death row. In other words, one in every four men sent to death row by the New Orleans District Attorney’s office from 1973-2002 was convicted after evidence that could have cast doubt on their guilt was withheld from them at trial. Four men, about 11%, were completely innocent.None of this kept Justice Antonin Scalia from concluding that Thompson spent 14 years on death row at Angola Prison because of the actions of a single “miscreant prosecutor.”Thompson, who went on to found the organization Resurrection After Exoneration, has called what New Orleans prosecutors tried to do to him an attempt at “premeditated murder.” In an interview with the Times-Picayune today, Thompson said, “This fight started for me 18 years ago, and it feels like it’s going to go on some more. There’s a lot of innocent guys who’s still on death row because of this corrupt system.”The implications of the Supreme Court’s decision in Connick v. Thompson reach far beyond John Thompson’s life and even beyond New Orleans. A majority of the justices have concurred that a district attorney’s office cannot be held responsible for the misconduct of its own prosecutors. “As it stands, there are no deterrents to these prosecutors,” said Nick Trenticosta. “If they get caught withholding evidence so what? Nothing happens to them.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsConnick v.

There are no sanctions imposed on them for rights violations of the accused. This is so wrong–I know of nowhere else that someone can intentionally, willfully & deliberately indulge in professional misconduct, & suffer no repercussions for it. I think that a prosecutor who has withheld evidence that could exonerate a defendant should have his state bar license suspended, if not revoked, depending on the seriousness of the evidence withheld.ReplyDave SeavyMay 31, 2011 at 3:51 amOf course they had to protect the DA.God forbid they do the moral thing and let this incident be a message to other prosecutors that witholding evidence – especially in a capital punishment case – will result in very severe consequences.They’ll let a possibly innocent man go to the execution chamber just to cover everyone’s hind end.This is why the death penalty needs to be abolished – forever.Prosecutors are politicians with ambitions, and have no problem using every trick in the book to gain a conviction, so that they can later run for another office and brag about their success in criminal courts.And we have some very blood thirsty justices at the top that will just sit back and let it happen.ReplyDIANA MONTES-WALKERMarch 30, 2011 at 6:27 pmI am not surprised.This has gone on forever.I have worked in the court system many years and, especially since former District Atty. Connick is retired, the Court saw no reason to find wrong-doing.I believe “conservatives” believe they are setting an example of being “tough on crime [and criminals]” in keeping with their political rhetoric.It is shameful.All the people can do is watch out for District Attorneys who seem to have won more than their fair share of cases and start to ask serious questions.Persons accused of crimes need to participate fully in their defense, ask alot of questions, have a good support system of people who will also ask questions, and we, as American citizens, must vote in laws that canprotect the accused from this type of abuse.I say again, I am not surprised.ReplyLizaMarch 30, 2011 at 4:05 pmwhy do they even bother to hold court if they are gonna do whatever they please and prosecute to the death “at any cost” ….justice need not be present.the whole thing makes me sick beyond sick.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
