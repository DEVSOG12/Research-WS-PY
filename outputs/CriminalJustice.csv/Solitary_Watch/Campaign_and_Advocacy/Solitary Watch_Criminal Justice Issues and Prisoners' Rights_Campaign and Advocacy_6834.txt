These men were tortured to death by cruel, sadistic and lazy staff members. You shouldn’t get the death penalty because of being mentally ill.- especiallyat a psychiatric hospital. The mentally ill inprison are also killed by cruel, sadistic and lazy prison staff members who are negligent or outright abusive. Mentally ill prisoners are frequently encouraged to commit suicide and are frequently driven tokill themselves because of this relentless abuse and cruelty.ReplyErika ZauzigOctober 13, 2014 at 11:08 pmI can’t begin to tell how angry I am over the deaths of the three patients at Bridgewater State Hospital.
