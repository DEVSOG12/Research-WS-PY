It also shows the resiliency of the human spirit and its ability to bounce back from a time when painting the cell walls red with his own blood was the only thing that brought Poindexter peace.”• An individual serving a life sentence in connection to the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Tanzania has won a federal appeal, after the FBI limited his contact to 32 people.   He is incarcerated in the supermax facility in Florence, Colorado and also subject to Special Administrative Measures, which further constrain his communication with the outside world.• A news outlet has obtained video that follows the last few hours of Christopher Lee Lopez’s life, while he is strapped into restraints at the San Carlos Correctional Facility in Pueblo, Colorado.  Lopez had recently been removed from solitary confinement after spending nine and a half months in “the box”; the video shows him having a grand mal seizure in the restraint chair, and prison guards only coming to his assistance over thirty minutes later.  A lawsuit has been filed in federal court.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility,California,California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,Christopher Lee Lopez,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Colorado,Dekalb county,Federal Prisons,Gregg Marcantel,Lawsuits/Litigation,Missouri,New Mexico,Orange is the New Black,Randy Poindexter,Raphael Sperry,Solitary Confinement,South Carolina,Special Administrative MeasuresAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.

Got a feelin I’m meant to do this too as i can only work from home now which has put a stop to my usual non violent direct action. I can help with amnesty .int. too. My pen pal in the states has been refused his full dose of insulin..as shocking as your son’s mal treatment. I’m a mum too. I offer you my support Jenny xReplyjayJune 23, 2014 at 4:29 pmJenny betenson you’re a true mother. Don’t forget you have friends and supporters here .ReplyJenny betensonJune 23, 2014 at 4:36 pmhttps://www.change.org/petitions/rollin-cook-get-my-son-immediate-access-to-qualified-medical-specialists-who-can-properly-diagnose-and-treat-my-sonI’m hitting roadblocks everywhere I turn, will you please help by signing and sharing my petition?ReplyJenny betensonJune 23, 2014 at 4:39 pmThank you so much Jay, I am getting desperate for help and will not stop until my son is helped and every other prisoner is treated with respect and not have their civil rights violated. I will fight this until the day I die. I thought my calling in life was to fight for my special needs kids but I have gotten them everything they are entitled to. Prison reform is obviously where I am meant to be.ReplyjayJune 23, 2014 at 4:19 pmThe report on Mr.Christopher lee lopez (grand mail seizure in restraint chair/30min for help)has left me particularly nauseatedand repulsed. This is because I’m severely epileptic which is exasserbated by stress.the utter panic he would have felt during/before/after fitting is almost indescribable, even when people like me have access to medics, essential drugs, reassurance and safety.Mr. lopez had none of this.bless his heart.we have footage i think?it’s time for these sick people to be shamed,and not just lose their jobs, the system as whole taken notice of by those in high office,THE ONES YOU VOTE FOR.ReplyCasey EhresmanJune 23, 2014 at 10:52 amI’m with Jenny.What can we do? How can this be stopped?ReplyJean Casella and James RidgewayJune 23, 2014 at 11:02 amCasey: It will be a long, uphill battle, but you can begin by checking our Action page for events and organizations in your state or on the national level that are fighting solitary. You can also alleviate someone’s suffering by writing to them. The ACLU’s Stop Solitary page has information about pending reform legislation that you can support.ReplyJenny betensonJune 23, 2014 at 12:58 pmI will write to them. I have a son in max in Draper Utah who is let out for one hour every two days. He does have once cellmate and I am currently fighting the prison to save his life because he is 25 with a mass on his tongue, weight loss, and enlarged lymph nodes. The prison has refused to do a biopsy and I have all paperwork to prove deliberate indifference. My fight for the last nine months has shown me that I need and WILL fight wherever I can to make sure this does not happen again. I don’t want to take away from your campaign here but if you would allow me to I would like to post my petition on change.org to help save him. If not I will continue to offer support anywhere I can in the name of my son.ReplyJenny betensonJune 23, 2014 at 12:03 amI will not stand by and let this happen without trying to do something. We all need to stand up and fight for human rights.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
