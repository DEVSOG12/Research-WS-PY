This is from Scott Henson’s Grits for Breakfast, which provides the blogosphere’s best coverage of the Texas criminal justice system.Easter is strikingly filled with criminal justice themes, isn’t it? The Christian religion was essentially founded on a repudiation of Roman capital punishment. Easter celebrates the sinless Man-God killed for His beliefs who triumphed over the grave, mooting, even while respecting to the end, the earth-bound laws that condemned Him. Jesus, a blameless man executed, is the all-time poster child for the innocence movement. Corrupt and biased prosecutors prevailed in His case because of a judge’s personal indifference and deference to the mob. Christ’s betrayal by Judas was the archetype cementing into Christian values a lingering distrust of snitches and informants. Romans accused the disciples of grave robbery. St. Peter committed assault with a deadly weapon in the Garden of Gethsemane then thrice lied about his identity to avoid arrest. And taken as a whole, the passion story documents Jesus’ arrest, trial, and execution all taking place in an incredibly short span, as though criminal convictions could be obtained as quickly in real life as on an episode of Law & Order.Christmas is a story about family. Easter is a story about a wrongful criminal conviction, the misapplication of the death penalty, the overweening power of the state, and the irrepressible urge of humanity to resist it.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesTagscapital punishment,Christianity,death penalty,Death Row,Due Process,Easter,Jesus,Political PrisonersJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

LOLOh did anyone catch the article on how phone companies pay kickbacks to the BOP to gain a contact with them. It is a big money maker for both partners? Of course it is the inmates that get screwed with overpriced phone service even though most inmates come from impoverished households which cannot afford even normal rates.Where is all of this headed to? I think the last line of the article sums it up.“The overweening power of the state, and the irrepressible urge of humanity to resist it.”http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704547604576263261679848814.html?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_readReplyGritsforbreakfastApril 25, 2011 at 12:22 pmGlad you enjoyed it. :)ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
