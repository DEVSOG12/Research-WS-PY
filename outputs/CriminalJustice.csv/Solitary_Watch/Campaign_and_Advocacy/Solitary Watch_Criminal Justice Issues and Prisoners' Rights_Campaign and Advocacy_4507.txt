MendezUnited Nations Special Rapporteur on TortureMartin HornJohn Jay College of Criminal JusticeMichael MushlinPace University Law SchoolModerator: David StoeltingCommittee on International Human RightsSponsored by the Committee on International Human Rights, Stephen L. Kass, ChairThis program will examine whether the widespread use of extended solitary confinement in U.S. prisons, affecting tens of thousands of federal prisoners, is a necessary administrative measure or whether, despite the absence of physical abuse, “supermax” detention amounts to torture or other human rights violations and, if so, what changes should be made in current U.S. practices.This program is free to members of the bar and the public.  Advance registration is suggested, but not required, at http://www.abcny.org/The second event, the first of its kind on this subject, will be held next Tuesday at the 19th Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland:SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND ITS HUMAN RIGHTS IMPLICATIONSTuesday, 6 March 201211.00 – 13.00Room XXIV, Palais des NationsEvery day tens of thousands of prisoners and detainees are held in solitary confinement worldwide. Usually in isolation for at least 22 hours a day and denied all meaningful human contact, these prisoners and detainees are frequently held for months, years, and sometimes decades. They are held in conditions that the Special Rapporteur on Torture has found can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture. In a global study of the practice published last year at the General Assembly and in his statement to the 19th session of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur called on all countries to ban solitary confinement except in very exceptional circumstances and for minimal time periods. This briefing will examine the detrimental impacts of solitary confinement, the research that finds it to be a human rights violation, and the disproportionate impact of its use on mentally disabled persons and youth. The briefing will also offer concrete recommendations for future action to increase protections and effective safeguards from abusive and prolonged solitary confinement.Prof. Juan Mendez, Special Rapporteur on TortureThe global practice of solitary confinementPANELISTS:Amy Fettig, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)The practice of solitary confinement in the United StatesDr. Sharon Shalev, University of Oxford & International Centre for Prison Studies (ICPS)European practices of solitary confinement and its use during pre-trial detentionDorottya Karsay, Mental Disability Advocacy Center (MDAC)Persons with disabilities in solitary confinementJustice Renate Winter, Appeals Chamber of the Special Court of Sierra LeoneJuveniles in solitary confinementAndrea Huber, Penal Reform International (PRI)Solitary confinement of death row inmates/ lifers and the lack of internationalsafeguards against solitary confinementModerator: Jamil Dakwar, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsACLU,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Corrections Industry,Death Row,Eighth Amendment,Human Rights,International,International Agreements,Juveniles,NYC Bar Association,Penal Reform International,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Supermax Prisons,Torture,Torture,United NationsJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.
