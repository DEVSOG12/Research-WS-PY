The suit comes as the Colorado legislature and Corrections Department take steps towards reducing the use of solitary confinement across the state.• A Nebraska judge has ordered the state to release all documents relating to Nikko Jenkins, the man who killed four people just days after being released directly from solitary confinement.  Jenkins had spent more than half of his nearly 10 year sentence in isolation.• The ACLU of NJ has filed a lawsuit against Middlesex County, claiming that it is unconstitutional to subject a pretrial client with mental illness to solitary confinement.  Alexander Shalom, ACLU-NJ Senior Staff Attorney said, “Mental health professionals agree that subjecting someone like [our client] to well more than one hundred days in isolation can do serious, long-term damage to his mental health. To do that to anyone is cruel; to do it to a mentally ill and cognitively impaired person who is presumed innocent is inhuman.”• Folio has published a longform article on Daniel Linsinbinger, a 19-year old with mental illness who died in a restraint chair in a Florida county jail after spending 10 days in solitary confinement.• Writing for The Atlantic, Laura Dimon explores “How solitary confinement hurts the teenage brain.”  “If solitary confinement is enough to fracture a grown man, though,” she pens, “it can shatter a juvenile.”ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,ACLU-NJ,Colorado,Daniel Linsinbinger,Florida,Juveniles,Lawsuits/Litigation,Mental Illness,Nevada,Nikko Jenkins,Solitary Confinement,teenagersAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.

As usual, we cannot count the people in authority who have blood on their hands. Those who are paid to ‘look after’you teens and instead take pleasure in torture. My (younger) teen compelled me to comment in support of Daniel, other teenagers who are suffering this abhorrent cruelty, and any others who care or have cared for Mr Linsinbirger .
