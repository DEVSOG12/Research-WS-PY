Human Rights Council today to condemn the use of solitary confinement in the United States, following a written statement we submitted last month urging the Council to address this widespread violation of human rights. Also appearing today was Juan Mendez, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, who has said before that solitary confinement can amount to torture and today called for a review and reduction of the use of solitary confinement as a matter of human rights. Mendez has also called on the United States to allow him to visit to investigate the use solitary confinement in U.S. supermax prisons; the U.S. has yet to respond.The U.S. is unique among nations in its use of solitary confinement as an integral and regular component of its treatment of prisoners. Though there are no official numbers, a conservative estimate is that about 80,000 human beings are locked alonefor 22 hours or more each day in small, often windowless cells, isolated from any human contact (with the exception of very limited contact with prison staff), with no access to classes, job training, drug treatment, work or any other kind of rehabilitative programming.  The mentally ill, disproportionately represented in solitary confinement, often become even more desperately ill, sometimes engaging in self-mutilation or even suicide. Even some healthy prisoners begin to exhibit symptoms of mental illness after a short time in solitary. Thousands of youth are also locked away in this manner each day, in both adult and juvenile facilities.The use of solitary confinement in the U.S. is an urgent and pervasive problem deserving of the world stage and worldwide condemnation. The U.S. should implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, but greater global attention and action will be needed to ensure this nation’s use of solitary confinement is consistent with international human rights standards.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsACLU,Civil Liberties/Civil Rights,Human Rights,International,International Agreements,Juveniles,Mental Illness,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Torture,United NationsJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

And the UN the ACLU doctors judges, specialists can not not seem to stop this crazy train. I get no answers from legislators I write either. So is there a solution? Now with the economy bad you’d think mass incarceration would let up maybe it will but all I’ve noticed is more proactive programs in prison are cut. isolation rises. is there a solution?ReplyJune F. McGinnisMarch 6, 2012 at 2:24 amMy good friend was given 90 days in SMU for hugging and kissing her girlfriend. No sexual contact was involved whatsoever. A simple quick hug and kiss.ReplyJeffrey DunmoreMarch 5, 2012 at 7:48 pmseemingily the populations more effected by the mass incarceration and the manner of treatment the women and men are subject too; are those populations that are *lockedinside a type of apathy* and equally devastating is the *assimilation* on a deep level, JUST DO THE TIMECUZ MY GYRL AND FAMILY WILL HOLD ME DOWN. these are the blockcadesagainst unifying families of incarcerated youth/families of those in supermaxs, families period!!!!! under whatumbrella can those family members of physically ill elderlybe accessed? as a support person for men facing challenges of prostate cancer,Diabetes and highblood pressure. I CAN ONLY IMAGE WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE LIKE BEHIND THOSE WALLS AND *THE HOLES*,giventhe manner of food substances they are forced to live on year after year. Food is Medicine and theirs is very suspect.ReplyTheresa ShoatzMarch 5, 2012 at 5:23 pmSeniors, The Mentally I’ll, and our youth areforcibly housed in 23hr a day lockdown Fashionable called RHU and SMU, plain and simple the Hole. It’s Torture under the United States watchful eye. Solitary Confinement places the prisoner alone with themselves, dying inside from lack of human contact. Fact is prisoners are hurting themselves and taking their lives during this torture period.Do the Right Thing And Shut Down All Solitary Confinement Units Throughout the United States Enough is EnoughReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
