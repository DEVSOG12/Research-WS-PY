RussMarch 31, 2013 at 2:44 pmNice to see another Alan on board that I communicate with… These folks have done a wonderful job… Far better than our own site… It is so hard to get dedicated volunteers and money is so very tight… I was just communication to Allen T about organizing and Invited him to my home here in New London CT, and to do one of my TV shows, I hope he takes me up on that. Also I would love to see more ex-offenders talking and sharing even if it gets heavy; it is good to get ideas out and I happen to believe it is the only way real change will come about… (Thank you for putting this site together) I believe the more we have the greater our chance for Change… NARCT has been wonderful for us here in New England, Bobby Dellelo represents us with them and effected their direction and what they have put forth. We love those folks, because they listen to us that have been there… (Again great and wonderful work here)ReplyAlan CYA #65085March 31, 2013 at 10:39 amI agree the founders of SW deserve a shout out. And at least two other ex-con’s have written on here. Mike Jewel and the one that works with Mills. But it would still be useful to have more step up.ReplyAlan MillsMarch 31, 2013 at 10:29 amIt has been amazing to watch the change in public discussion of solitary confinement over the last few years.Solitary Watch was a voice in the wilderness, crying for attention to a national scandal that no one knew about.mnow, Solitary Watch can’t even keep up with the reports in mainstream media, let alone all the work being done on the ground.Thank you Solitary Watch for being there when no one else was.ReplyAlan MillsMarch 31, 2013 at 10:28 amIt has been amazing to watch the change in public discussion of solitary confinement over the last few years.Solitary Watch was a voice in the wilderness, crying for attention to a national scandal that no one knew about.mnow, Solitary Watch can’t even keep up with the reports in mainstream media, let alone all the work being done on the ground.Thank you Solitary Watch for being there when no one else was.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085March 31, 2013 at 8:39 am@RussA powerful testament!You and Allen should write a post on here from the view point of ex-con’s with nothing to gain from telling your story. I imagine many people are skeptical when it comes from those still held in the hole. Take old Billy Blake’s story as an example.I think I am the only ex-con that has written on here that has done any time in the hole and my experience is “nada” (nothing) compared to what others have done and are still doing.ReplyFr. RussMarch 31, 2013 at 7:45 amOur message as a prisoner and ex-prisoner has not changed in 50 years; we know what should be done to institute a just system and what is Key:Empowering PrisonersPeople who support the prison movement still need to understand what self‑help and self‑determination are, because these are the basic philosophies we operate under. They simply mean that prisoners are helped by prisoners. And organizations concerned with prisoners should be run by and for prisoners.‑Russ Carmichael, NEPA News, April/May 1975It seems strange to me that convicts or excon‑victs are never consulted about prison matters, nor even considered for consultation, when they are what prison is all about and the only true professional.‑Robin E. Riggs, The Outlaw, March/April 1975I think the prison leadership has to come from the people suffering from the serious plight of prison. There are many people in our ghettos thruout the country who are in minimum security type prisons where the walls are not visible. I think that a lot of people can support our movement, but I do definitely believe that the movement must be initiated by the people who are oppressed the most by those particular possibilities or plights.‑Arnold Coles, NEPA News, April/May1975A national priority was discussed. The most obvious one came out‑convicts speaking for themselves; not sociologists, counselors, administrators, etc., but convicts. The most important national priority is the convict voice in their own destiny.‑Stephanie Riegel, “The National Prisoner Union Conference,” The Outlaw, June/July 1975Last spring when the guards went out on strike, the prisoners ran Walpole for nine weeks. Aside from the day to day running of the prison, including the kitchen, educational and vocational programs, prison industries and daily counts, the prisoners took care of their own internal problems. There were no rapes or killings.The movie “3,000 Years and Life” was filmed at this time. It shows Jerry explaining how wrongdoers are corrected by persuasion and embarrassment in front of peers. He said that if one con steals from another, the men tell him, “You’re a pig. Just like the System.” The brother gets embarrassed. Then the men say, “It’s no big deal, we know it won’t happen again.” Then they pat him on the back, give him a cigarette, and it’s over.When the guards returned exactly a year ago today, as I write, Jerry and Bobby Dellelo … were stripped, beaten, run naked across broken glass and thrown in the hole. The administration doesn’t want the prisoners to exercise responsibility, but when the prisoners had the responsibility of running the prison, the prisoners virtually ended violence at Walpole, and generally ran the prison better than it had ever been run before.Superintendant Vinzant has a different perspective on prisoner solidarity. “All prisoner solidarity does is to foster disrespect, tension, and abuse between the prisoners and the guards .‑Donna Parker, NEPA News, June 1974Prisoners’ demands are no secret. Whether prisoners are bursting from their cages in anger and frustration or coolly presenting carefully drawn manifestos, their message is the same:ReplyFr. RussMarch 31, 2013 at 7:38 amAllen T wrote a great description of Solitary on an a joining thread and the reasons why many prisoners confine themselves voluntarily; it appears he could write a book on the subject. For those who would look at the totally problems his insight if well worth reading… Over my nearly fifty years in the prison change business it seems every time we think we are doing something positive we go backwards, very frustrating… I finally became, what is deemed, a prison abolitionist, in the 1970s rather than an advocate reformer… This changed happened in me after our Walpole failure in 1973 (ref: When the Prisoners Ran Walpole) like many that had worked diligently for change over many years; we found that the system as it stood looked and in our mind was hopeless to any real beneficial change; and this was at a time when we where emptying the prisons out and starting real programs for our people it was in that era we found a hopelessness. Then the Drug wars and the prison population exploded to many times what it was in the early and mid 1970; and we went seriously backward into our current mode of lock them up and throw away the key… (give them no hope) It is our shame as a society..ReplyElizMarch 31, 2013 at 1:27 amWhile I don’t doubt solitary confinement is cruel and unusual punishment in most cases. What if a prisoner request to be in solitary confinement and would prefer being there longer than 30 or even 3 months.ReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)March 30, 2013 at 9:45 pmA movement such as this is impossible to ignore and defeatReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
