According to an account on Raw Story:Derek Thomas was admitted to West Jefferson Hospital in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Thursday, after a possible suicide attempt, reports ABC affiliate WGNO.When the Supreme Court justice’s nephew refused to put on a hospital gown and said he wanted to leave the hospital, doctors ordered security to restrain him.Security guards “punched him in his lip, pulled out more than a fistful of his dreadlocks and tasered him to restrain him,” a statement from Thomas’ family said.Shortly afterwards, family members say, Thomas suffered a “massive epileptic seizure.”Still, there’s no reason why Justice Thomas should be “shocked” that such a thing could happen. As one of the nine highest placed individuals in the U.S. Justice system, he should know that these things–and much worse–happen every day to Americans who suffer from mental illness.Our jails are now the largest mental health facilities in the nation, and they are filled with people who are there because they exhibited behavior common to untreated mental illness, including drug abuse, assault, and “quality of life” crimes. Once in jail, they are likely to further act out and land in solitary confinement–which is of course the worst possible place for them. Derek Thomas was reportedly deemed to be suicidal when he arrived at the hospital. A common “treatment” for suicidal prisoners is, again, placement in solitary confinement, for “their own protection.” Once there, many of these prisoners make every attempt to kill themselves–and some succeed.As we wrote earlier this week, the St. Tammany Parish Jail in Covington, Louisiana–which is just 50 miles north of the hospital where Derek Thomas suffered his abuse–has come up with a novel “solution” to the problem of suicidal inmates. It places them in 3″ x 3″ cages, half-naked and without bedding, a toilet, or anything else they might use to do themselves in. Some have remained in the cages for weeks or even months. The ACLU of Louisiana is fighting for their release, but have so far been unsuccessful.Clarence Thomas has yet to protest the torture of  St. Tammany Parish’s suicidal prisoners–or of any prisoners at all, for that matter. As New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse wrote earlier this year, Clarence Thomas has never once sided with a prisoner who claimed violation of the Eighth Amendment’s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. This included a case where “a guard had responded to [a prisoner’s] request for a grievance form by slamming him onto the concrete floor and then punching, kicking and choking him until another guard pulled the attacker off,” and another where  an inmate “had been handcuffed to a hitching post and left to stand shirtless in the sun for seven hours without water or bathroom breaks.” Thomas has said that the framers of the Constitution “simply did not conceive of the Eighth Amendment as protecting inmates from harsh treatment.”To our knowledge, Justice Thomas also has never spoken out in any way about the suffering of the mentally ill in the United States, whether in prisons and jails, in genuine mental health facilities, or on the streets, where millions of homeless mentally ill people live out their lives.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCivil Liberties/Civil Rights,Clarence Thomas,Constitution,Derek Thomas,Eighth Amendment,Lawsuits/Litigation,Louisiana,Mental Illness,nephew,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,Torture,West Jefferson HospitalJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

Every minister, every doctor and every leader of any community organization knows that mental illness can strike down members of his immediate circle.”And here is some light reading on our present day situation.http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/12/10/left_in_uncertain_hands_a_haunted_life_ends_tragically/BELIEVE IT!ReplyMillie BarnetJuly 14, 2010 at 2:32 pmOne can only hope that having the dagger come close to his heart would awaken Clarence Thomas, along with other of our leaders, and the millions of our countrymen/women who are unconscious of/untroubled by the relegation of the mentally ill to prison (following the closing of the state mental hospitals in the nineties to “save money”).Mental hospitals weren’t great and did not cure illness, but to put the mentally ill into the street when they cannot fend for themselves, or prison when they misbehave, is cruel beyond the ordinary level of punishment, which is high enough already even for the “guilty.”Would that everyjudge and justice in the land had to confront this savagery in his/her own family; oh yes, throw in the wardens and their lieutenants across the land whose comfortable lives are almost never troubled by the torture of helpless victims under their watch.ReplyJean MottJuly 14, 2010 at 2:00 pmOthers in positions of power maybe should experience first hand what goes on in the world of incarceration/detainment themselves so than feel the pain and indignation themselves first hand.ReplyLizaJuly 14, 2010 at 1:52 pmwow.. is this GENUINE “Justice”? Me thinks it is starting to look like it…. now let’s see some checks and balanaces…ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
