The same study found that 65% of those with severe mental disabilities had received no treatment in the previous 12 months.”Many of these prisoners end up among the thousand or so held in administrative segregation in Michigan. “MDOC administrators acknowledge that the percentage of prisoners with mental illness in segregation is probably higher than in the overall population. Prisoners in segregation are handcuffed when they leave their cells, eat off serving trays pushed through the slots of steel doors, and generally lack the few privileges extended to those in general population, such as telephone calls, contact visits and television. Some stay in segregation for months, even years.”Gerritt leads with the story of one young prisoner whose symptoms of untreated mental illness landed him in solitary, and eventually shackled to his bed.On Jan. 10 of last year, corrections officers at Ionia Maximum Correctional Facility found 19-yearold Kevin DeMott banging his head against a blood-stained cell wall.Diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 11, inmate No. 608233 had languished in solitary for four months, sometimes without the psychotropic medication his psychiatrist prescribed. Normally 5-foot-10 and 171 pounds, he had lost 25 pounds.Officers ordered DeMott to stop banging his head, but he continued.After DeMott told officers who tried to restrain him that they would have to kill him, he was hit twice with pepper spray, then manacled in belly chains and leg irons, according to a critical incident report. Soon after, prison authorities charged him with disobeying a direct order, resulting in 30 days’ loss of privileges.Too often, the Department of Corrections punishes instead of treats mental illness. Michigan’s 32 prisons hold thousands of mentally ill inmates, including as many as 200 isolated in segregation cells, where they are locked up for 23 hours a day, or longer, unable to participate in treatment programs, and sometimes cut off from the medications prescribed to help manage their illnesses.It’s an insidious cycle: Mentally ill inmates act out and exhibit unstable or destructive behavior. Prison officials respond by further restricting their movements and their opportunities to get treatment.Privately, MDOC officials acknowledge that many mentally ill inmates don’t belong in prison, where security demands trump treatment needs. Over the last two decades, however, Michigan has slashed spending on in-patient treatment, leaving courts with few options but to send mentally ill offenders to jail or prison.“We don’t control who comes to us,” said Russ Marlan, administrator of MDOC’s executive bureau.Read the full story, complete with chilling photographs, here.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsadministrative segregation,Mental Illness,Mental Illness,Michigan,Michigan Department of Corrections,Prison Health Care,Solitary Confinement,solitary confinmentJean Casella and James RidgewayJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

I witnessed this in a private youth lockup. Shame on us!ReplyMary Lou BrncikFebruary 6, 2012 at 8:47 pmThis treatment of our mentally ill is indecent and must no longer be tolerated. We at David’s Hope are dedicated to securing mental health treatment rather than incarceration for those who are found to be in violation of the law due to untreated symptoms of their mental disorder.

He needed lawyers to achieve his vision of a just society. Even the inimitable novelist would agree that the two old trades must go hand in hand, together improving the noble system that, for all its Dickensian farce, makes us civilized.”http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/opinion/dickens-v-lawyers.html?_r=1&hpReplyCarl Toersbijns (@carltoersbijns)February 5, 2012 at 4:10 pmWhile you are knocking on Michigan’s DOC door, look next door to Arizona and ask them the same questions inside the SMU’s that are full of SMI [severely mentally ill] persons locked up and mistreated ~~ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
