Cesar DeLeon also alleged that he was subject to retaliation during the force-feeding, which was captured on film but has not been released.• After a spike in violence on the inside, New York City Corrections Commissioner Joseph Ponte has said he would like to delay the planned end to solitary confinement for young people aged 19 to 21.
