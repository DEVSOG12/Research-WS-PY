From the Helena Independent Record:A 17-year-old boy suffering from mental illnesses was so traumatized by his deplorable treatment in the Montana State Prison that he twice attempted to kill himself by biting through the skin on his wrist to puncture a vein, a lawsuit filed Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana alleges.The lawsuit filed in Lewis and Clark County District Court claims that the boy, “Robert Doe,” has been treated illegally and inhumanely and has been detained for about 10 months in solitary confinement. Doe was Tasered as part of a “behavior modification plan,” pepper-sprayed and stripped naked in view of other inmates, the complaint states….His available mental health treatment consists of a prison staff member knocking on his door once a week and asking if he has any concerns, according to documents, and then he must answer by yelling within earshot of other inmates.Since March, he has been locked in a solitary cell all but five to six hours a week, and he is not allowed personal visits or telephone calls.For more information on the case, including the press release and complaint , visit the ACLU of Montana’s web site.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsACLU,childhood abuse,depression,Juveniles,Lawsuits/Litigation,Mental Illness,Montana,Montana State Prison,Pine Hills Correctional Facility,Psychological Effects,PTSD,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,teens,Torture,youthJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.
