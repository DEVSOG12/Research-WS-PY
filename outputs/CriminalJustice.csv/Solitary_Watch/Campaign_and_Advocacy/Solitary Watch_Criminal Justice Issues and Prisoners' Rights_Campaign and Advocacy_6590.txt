The decision will not affect the 4,000 or so people currently held in administrative segregation in the state.• The Onondaga County Legislature voted to ban the use of youth solitary confinement in all its detention centers and jails. Earlier this summer, the county settled a lawsuit that alleged it relied excessively on the use of solitary for children.• A man who was wrongfully convinced and spent nine years behind bars is suing the City of Detroit as well as two police officers. Davontae Sanford’s attorney, Bill Goodman, told a local outlet, “[Sanford] spends 9 of them in an adult prison as a 14 year old kid, much of that time in solitary confinement.”• A North Dakota woman has secured a settlement from a local county and police department after they failed to provide her with the sign language interpreter she needed. After Christine Stein called 911 to report a man who was threatening to kill himself, she was arrested instead, and held in solitary confinement.• The Colorado Department of Corrections has received $10.6 million from the state to temporarily lease a private prison, in order to address overcrowding within existing facilities. The Centennial Correctional Facility-South, in Cañon City, CO, remains shuttered because it was designed to hold people in solitary confinement; despite requests from the Department of Corrections, the state has declined to renovate the facility, and is instead investigating other approaches to reducing the prison population.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesSeven Days in SolitaryTags7D,7D2,Centennial Correctional Facility-South,Colorado,Davontae Sanford,deaf,Detroit,North Dakota,Onondaga County,overcrowding,TexasAviva StahlAviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based reporter who writes about science/health at the intersection of mass incarceration, national security, and trans rights.
