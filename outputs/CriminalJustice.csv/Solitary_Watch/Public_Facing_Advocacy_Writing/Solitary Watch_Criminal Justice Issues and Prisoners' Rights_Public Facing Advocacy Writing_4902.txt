He was confined in Tamms Supermax Prison for a full decade, from 2002 through 2012, when a court ruling gave him and others at Tamms a due process right to a fair hearing, which allowed him to win a transfer out of Tamms. Tamms would be emptied of prisoners and closed the following year–coincidentally, on his birthday. Joseph Dole has written many articles, essays, and research papers that have been published in Prison Legal News, The Journal of Prisoners on Prisons, and other print and online publications. His essay “The Meaning of Life” (also reprinted on Solitary Watch) appears in the new anthology Too Cruel, Not Unusual Enough, published by The Other Death Penalty Project. More of his writings can be found at www.realcostofprisons.org/writing/ (Thanks to Lois Ahrens of the Real Cost of Prisons Project for forwarding us the following poem.) He can be reached by writing: Joseph Dole, K84446, Stateville Correctional Center, P.O. Box 112, Joliet, IL 60434. –Jean Casella.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .A guard informed me upon arrival thatthere are benefits to this isolation.He promoted the fact that we are nowall safe from gang retaliation.I had to ask “But what of theretaliation of the prison administration?”He smiled cryptically as he enjoyedthis in ecstatic contemplation.None of what I was experiencing wasmaking me feel safe. But then, by “grace,”I see a new definition. I’m safe frommy family’s loving embrace.I’m safe from having education takeignorance’s place.I’m safe from recreation keeping myheart’s healthy pace.How I wish I could articulate this quasi-existence that I’ve grown to hate.Or get an answer to why so many strangerssadistically enjoy my monotonous fate.They say societal enlightenment takes time, but what if it takeslonger than your life, and you’re forced to wait?ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesVoices from SolitaryTagsCorrections Industry,Due Process,Illinois,Life Without Parole,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,supermax,Supermax Prisons,Tamms,Torture,Voices from SolitaryVoices from SolitaryThe Voices from Solitary series publishes dispatches from people surviving the lived experience of solitary confinement.Help Expose the Hidden World of Solitary ConfinementAccurate information and authentic storytelling can serve as powerful antidotes to ignorance and injustice.
