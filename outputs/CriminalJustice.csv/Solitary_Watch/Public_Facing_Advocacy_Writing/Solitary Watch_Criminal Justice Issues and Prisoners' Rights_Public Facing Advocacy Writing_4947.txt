And this fellowship will help us carry forward these efforts.Soros Justice Fellowships are awarded to both journalists and advocates “working to advance fairness and transparency in the U.S. criminal justice system.” A complete list of the 2012 fellows appears here. (Notably, it includes two others who are working on the issue of solitary confinement.)This is a major event in the short history of Solitary Watch, and in addition to thanking the Open Society Foundations, we want to express our gratitude to all of the people who made it possible for us to reach this point:our donors, whose generosity, faith in us, and belief in our mission have enabled us to take Solitary Watch from an earnest idea to a flourishing reality;our interns, who joined a shoestring operation and brought to it all of their brilliance and energy;our readers, whose growing numbers attest to their concern for this vital but hidden domestic human rights issue;the advocates who work tirelessly on this issue, and who kindly shared their expertise with us; andthe current and former prisoners and their families who trusted us to tell or share their stories.ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsMedia,Open Society Institute,Solitary Confinement,Soros Justice FellowsJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.
