Dr. Kupers delivered the keynote address at the Strategic Convening on Solitary Confinement and Human Rights, sponsored by the Midwest Coalition on Human Rights, on November 9, 2012, in Chicago, Illinois.In his address, which is presented in the four videos below, Dr. Kupers provides a comprehensive overview of the psychological damage inflicted on people subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, detailing how use of the practice qualifies as an intentional human rights abuse. He also addresses the use of confinement in supermax prisons and the lacking quality of and inaccessibility to mental health care to those held in isolation (people who clearly urgently require adequate counseling to cope with the extreme distress of their isolation). Finally, Dr. Kupers touches on the detrimental impact of sexual abuse that takes place in detention facilities.http://youtu.be/czsbt0quV0Yhttp://youtu.be/iOGnecS-uqohttp://youtu.be/8MhQUDDQBCQhttp://youtu.be/MwsxS4H1FzsShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesNews & FeaturesTagsCorrections Industry,Dr. Terry Kupers,Human Rights,Mental Illness,Politics of Punishment,Prison Health Care,prisons,Psychological Effects,Sexual Assault,Solitary Confinement,Suicide,Supermax Prisons,Torture,VideoLisa DawsonLisa Dawson served as an assistant editor, social media manager, and contributor at Solitary Watch.

Russ CarmichaelApril 24, 2013 at 11:58 amMy question becomes, Doc given what you say, do you believe in the Death Penalty for murder? “A life for a life or a life for two or three?” (It is just a question?)…ReplyPetra de JongApril 24, 2013 at 10:40 amIs there a written transcript of this talk available somewhere?ReplyLisa DawsonApril 24, 2013 at 12:02 pmIn response to Petra de Jong, I did a brief search for a transcript of Dr. Kuper’s address but found nothing.ReplyPetra de JongApril 24, 2013 at 12:05 pmMaybe I’ll try to contact him directly. There’s someone I’d like to send this to, but since he is IN solitary confinement, a YouTube video won’t do.ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
