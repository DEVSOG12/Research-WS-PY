Silva, 34, has been held in close management, or solitary confinement, for over four years. Regarding the first poem below, entitled “Killed by the Dark,” Silva expresses his sadness and anger at the suicide of another prisoner, also held in isolation. He writes:The poem to go along with this post is dedicated to Johnny Reed who was murdered by the department of corrections.. . . Johnny was not perfect, but I liked him and neither he nor anyone else deserves to go through what we are going through with this long term solitary confinement.The poem pretty much says how I feel. I just found this out yesterday so I don’t even know what to write. But it is a reality check for me. We are all mortal and I have been real close to ending my own life many times. But Johnny will not be forgotten, at least not by me.In his second poem, Silva makes a plea for people on the outside to write to someone held in isolation. Of his poem, he writes:Imagine being so alone you feel you are surrounded by darkness. Having so much to say and no one to say it to. So much love to give yet no one to receive that love.You want for a normal conversation the way a thirsty man wants for water in the desert.You want for human contact, any kind of human contact to remind you you’re alive.A letter would be wonderful but it seems all the people in your life who cared have drifted away like a leaf in an autumn breeze. You recognize the wrong you have done and often blame yourself for how bad things are though you know deep down no one deserves this treatment. Not even you.You contemplate suicide but somehow find the strength everyday for just one more day. You hang on by a thread of hope because tomorrow might be different.I can tell you when I feel like this, a letter alone make all the difference. So if you’re reading this blog, take time to write a letter. How can it hurt? Even if you don’t write to me. Choose anyone who is living in a concrete cage like mine. Write to them if for no other reason than to give them someone to talk to.Open your heart and through you, you could bring the hope that keeps a man alive from day to day with only a caring letter.The following poems originally appeared on Silva’s blog, Concrete Cage, which is maintained by a friend on the outside.

Worth a lookReplyjayJuly 29, 2014 at 8:29 amI read the article in the above link and found it to show extreme bias. Important details are left out and foundMr. Silva has been mis-quoted and unfairly represented in other media too.It’s true that prison culture would require a man to do what he did to do this convicted child rapist; no man I’ve spoken to has informed me he would’ve been compelled to do anything else.This is another case of a person with a lesser sentence being forced intoa situation where he or she neverleaves prison.If you are unable to change the whole system, there is at the very least the opportunity to support individuals.I would encourage readers to find it out the exact physical and mental effects on a person in longterm solitary confinement;..and remind that more than 2 wk in solitary is internationally recognized as torture.ReplyAlan CYA # 65085July 26, 2014 at 11:01 amhttp://www.tcpalm.com/news/martin-inmate-cellmate-needed-be-killed-videosIn the dysfunctional world of prison, waking up to your roommate masturbating while holding pictures of children in your family is deemed a capital offense by most inmates.In fact not acting against such men in prisons could get you killed.This interview should give anyone interested in writing Silva some insight into this code of conduct.Silva’s concern for his friend and his moral outrage over his roommates sick behavior shows he has compassion. In such an unnatural environment his action was expected by his peers.That is just the way it is. If we don’t like it then we need to change the system.Even though I’ve done time, and my own brother died this way in prison I question the wisdom of following them down the rabbit hole by writing.ReplyjayJuly 25, 2014 at 7:29 pmWas really hoping to find a reply or 2 to my comment above, so that i could reiterate what I’d previously said, for reasons of hope someone, if only one, would take notice of what Ricky Silva va has to say in his work.I hope everyone else has found the poems as emotive, as profound, and so incredibly raw that they and their messages can’t be brushed aside.He intonates that the lives of human beings hang on by a fragile thread, and that thread will snap – shown in his poem dedicated to fellow inmate Johnny who hung himself after 10yr in the ‘darkness’.It’s pathetically inadequate to label his poetry as ‘touching’. If his words fail to compell at least one person to stop that thread from breaking by picking up a pen, my heart breaks again. You don’t even have to include an address; Ricky shows an unselfish nature by making this plea not just for himself but for anyone living in such hellish conditions. Just to remind, you could be responsible for saving a lifeReplyjayJuly 25, 2014 at 3:48 am“we contemplate suicide, hoping that one day will be different”..I’d implore you to answer the plea, an envelope, a stamp, the few seconds it takes to mail a letter of support, or a card simply expressing love..that’s an easy task. How many people have to use the mail anyway? Would one extra letter be all that difficult?You may want to share some of your own poetry, stories and anecdotes, you may save a man’s lifeReplybodenJuly 24, 2014 at 1:26 pmI applaud the sentiment in Ricky’s poetry, and know, as a letter writer, the power of writing to prisoners, in my case to death row rather than to those in solitary who are in as much need as the guys on the row.I only wish I had the answer to Ricky’s request to get more people to pick up a pen and write, when so many of us think of this as an outdated, unnecessary mode of communication.I suppose the only way is to continue to talk and write about its importance and hope to convince a few more.We are all more than the worst thing we ever did and none of us are beyond human consideration and friendship.Replyyeny HernandezJuly 24, 2014 at 1:00 pmI really like the poems , is true the things u wrote in the poem,my brother went thru that ,suicide himself ,but thank god nothing happen to him,his detained in NC .ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
