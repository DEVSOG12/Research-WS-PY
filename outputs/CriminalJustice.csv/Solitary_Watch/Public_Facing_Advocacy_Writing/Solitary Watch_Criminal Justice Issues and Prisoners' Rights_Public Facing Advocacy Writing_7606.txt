Although he is a Maryland state prisoner, he is currently serving his time in the Special Management Unit of the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. At Lewisburg, he writes,  “Collectively, prisoners are nothing but mere props for the twisted amusement of staff. Inmates are placed or left in dangerous situations as a result of the personal dislikes of staff, or as a means of retaliation for filing ADMINISTRATIVE GRIEVANCES. Speaking for myself and the other inmates assigned to the Special Management Unit here, which is a 23-24 hour lockdown disciplinary program with another individual usually in the confines of a small matchbox like cell, WE FEEL HELPLESS.”Marco Miguel is an observant Sunni Muslim and a dedicated writer. His work is published on the website Live from Lockdown, where his poem “Changing Prayer” recently appeared.Why me?!I seem to always scream,Constantly awakening to nightmares,Wishing they were only dreamsReality is so dark,The truth so grim,Sometimes I smile to pretend I’m happy,Not sad,Or order phentermine 37.5 canada mad,They laugh at meFake,I imagine real;I can’t lie,I’d like to wipe the sweat off my brow,If the cards they deal weren’t markedSorrow is embedded in my part of the play,In stark contrast to a fair handThat never seems to come my wayAlways on the cusp of tragedyThe verge of destruction nearIf it wasn’t for the consistent rain and pain,I wouldn’t be able to think clearAdversity I’m used to!Unfortunately,I don’t believeI’ll ever know peaceCause as soon as sunshine attempts to touch me with its rays,Multiple gray clouds appear to ensure I don’t receive reliefMy grief brings joys to heartsAnd smiles to soulsWho continue to swing the rope I gripWishing I slipFallHoping I let goHold on with dear lifeLegs danglingI don’t allow them to turn it into a noose I hang inStranglingI breathe,Though,I do want to free my hands and drop;Frustrated,Disgruntled,Feeling like I gave all I can,ShouldAnd couldIt’s over!No more!Accept the fact that the door is closedThen,Act exactly like the other inhabitantsNot sure if I’d regret my choice in reflections of distractionI’ve got so much to lose;Still so much more to gain!All too plainTo my disdain.The rain,Thunder,Storms,And clouds will remainThey’re determined to stop meChange,I prayYou’ll come…………..ShareShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare this post via EmailVisit our pageCategoriesVoices from SolitaryTagsFederal Prisons,Live from Lockdown,Psychological Effects,Solitary Confinement,Supermax PrisonsJames Ridgeway and Jean CasellaJames Ridgeway (1936-2021) was the founder and co-director of Solitary Watch.

From Pennsylvania to California we see this cruel and brutal practice used even with our most seriously mentally ill. We must continue to bring attention to this tragic degradation of human life. One day almost all prisoners will be brought back into our communitites. What will we have taught them?ReplyLeave a Reply					Cancel replyP.O.
