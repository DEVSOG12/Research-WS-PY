Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit that challenged the NYPD’s racially discriminatory and unconstitutional practices filed a motion asking the court to amend its 2013 remedial order to ensure meaningful oversight in the remedial process going forward from people who are being policed. “In the last three years, this monitorship has veered far off course from what the court intended in its 2013 order and from what happens in most other police monitorships around the country,”  said Darius Charney, senior staff attorney and lead counsel in Floyd v. City of New York. “We are asking the court to take steps to return to the public-facing, community-driven reform process it originally envisioned.” To continue reading, and to learn more about the background of this case, head to our website.Last modified August 4, 2021View the discussion thread.Spread the wordTweetShareEmailStaff favoritesPresident Obama: What Are You Waiting for?
