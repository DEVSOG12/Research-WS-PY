The civil case Rasul v. Rumsfeld was filed by theCenter for Constitutional Rights (CCR) along with co-counsel in October2004 on behalf of four British citizens who were unjustly held for morethan three years.In Friday's cross-appeal before a three-judge panel of the D.C. CircuitCourt of Appeals, the government appealed a lower court decision whichaffirmed that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) does applyto the detainees at Guantanamo. CCR attorneys argued that the lowercourt's dismissal of the constitutional and international law claimsshould be overturned."The detainees at Guantanamo have been subject to deliberatehumiliation because of the Defense Department's misguided and illegaleffort to exploit their faith to break them down psychologically," said Eric Lewis of Baach Robinson & Lewis, co-counsel with CCR, who argued the appeal. "Thejudge below correctly found these practices 'abhorrent.' We hope topersuade the Court of Appeals that the district court was correct infinding such conduct illegal under the Religious Freedom RestorationAct, a statute meant to ensure that the government respects thereligious faith of all people."Rasul v. Rumsfeld was filed in October 2004 in D.C. CircuitCourt on behalf of British citizens Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, andRhuhel Ahmed - who were featured in the documentary The Road to Guantanamo- and fellow British citizen Jamal al-Harith. While at Guantanamo, theywere subject to repeated beatings, sleep deprivation, extremes of hotand cold, forced nudity, death threats, interrogations at gunpoint,menacing with unmuzzled dogs, religious abuse, and racial harassment.None of the four had ever been a member of a terrorist group or takenup arms against the United States. The suit charges then-Secretary ofState Donald Rumsfeld and the Pentagon chain of command with approvinginterrogation methods that they knew were in violation of U.S. andinternational law."This is the first case demanding accountability from the governmentofficials who condoned and perpetrated torture and abuse atGuantanamo," said CCR attorney Emi Maclean. "Ourcourts need to show the world - and the U.S. government - that it takesthe documented abuse of detainees in U.S. custody seriously."CCR and co-counsel's appeal before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appealsseeks to overturn a February 2006 D.C. district court decision thatdismissed the plaintiffs' constitutional, Alien Tort Statute (ATS), andGeneva Convention claims and found that the defendants were entitled toqualified immunity as they were acting within the scope of theiremployment in authorizing or condoning "aggressive interrogationtechniques." However, in a May 2006 decision, D.C. District Court JudgeRicardo Urbina upheld the plaintiffs' right to claims of religiousabuse under the RFRA, a law that was passed with overwhelmingcongressional support.Shafiq Rasul was the lead plaintiff in CCR's landmark Supreme Court case Rasul v. Bush,which held that the Guantanamo detainees have a right to challengetheir detention in federal court. During the next Supreme Court term,CCR will be bringing - for the third time - the case of the Guantanamodetainees before the highest court in the land. Arguments in thecombined cases Al Odah v. United States and Boumediene v. Bush are tentatively scheduled for December 5, 2007. CCR, which filed Al Odahalong with co-counsel, represents many of the detainees at Guantanamoand coordinates the work of more than 500 pro bono attorneys working onthe detainee cases.Eric Lewis from the D.C. law firm Baach Robinson & Lewis is co-counsel with CCR in Rasul v. Rumsfeld.The Center for Constitutional Rights works with communities under threat to fight for justice and liberation through litigation, advocacy, and strategic communications. Since 1966, the Center for Constitutional Rights has taken on oppressive systems of power, including structural racism, gender oppression, economic inequity, and governmental overreach.
