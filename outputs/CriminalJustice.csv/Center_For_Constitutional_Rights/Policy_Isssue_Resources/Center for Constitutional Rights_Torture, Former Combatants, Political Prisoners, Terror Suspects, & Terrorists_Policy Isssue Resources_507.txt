Our efforts also include litigation opposing: experimental prison units that segregate Muslims, surveillance of Muslim communities, and attempts to coerce Muslims into spying on their communities. Some of our most fundamental rights — the right to habeas corpus, the right to due process, the right to a fair trial, the right to equal protection — rights that separate a democracy from a police state – are being systematically eroded in Muslim communities. The Center is committed to amplifying the voices of our clients, Muslim activists, and their communities through litigation and advocacy. Together, we are working to challenge the prejudice and fear-mongering that has increasingly been used after 9/11 to deny Muslim individuals and communities constitutional protection from government overreach and law enforcement abuse.NewsSee more NewsAugust 2, 2022On the Extrajudicial Killing of al-ZawahiriAugust 2, 2022, New York – In response to the U.S. government’s extrajudicial killing of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Center for Constitutional Rights issued the following statement: More than twenty years after 9/11 and nearly a year after President Biden withdrew troops from Afghanistan...August 1, 2022Feds settle suit alleging abuse by men detained after 9/11...“I don’t know that the director of the Bureau of Prisons has ever signed a letter of this nature before to individual clients, so that is unique,” said Rachel Meeropol, senior staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, who represents the men. ...
