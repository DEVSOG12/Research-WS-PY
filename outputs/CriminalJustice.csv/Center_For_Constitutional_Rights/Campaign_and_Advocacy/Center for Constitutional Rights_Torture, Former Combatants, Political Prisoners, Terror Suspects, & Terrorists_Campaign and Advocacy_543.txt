United States Historic CaseAt a GlanceDate Filed: February 19, 2002Current Status On February 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Military Commission Review issued a decision vacating David Hicks’s conviction.Our Team:Shayana KadidalBaher AzmyJ. Wells DixonBaher AzmyShayana KadidalJ. Wells DixonCo-Counsel Civilian counsel Joseph Margulies and Stephen Kenny, and military defense counsel Samuel Morison and U.S. Air Force Major Justin SwickClient(s) David HicksNovember 1, 2013Case Description Hicks v. United States was an appeal on behalf of former Guantánamo detainee David Hicks asking the U.S. Court of Military Commission Review to overturn his conviction for “providing material support for terrorism,” a charge that was invalidated in 2012 when the D.C. Circuit ruled in Hamdan v. United States (“Hamdan II”) that “material support” was not, and had never been, a crime under the international laws of war. The D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, reached the same conclusion in 2014 in Al Bahlul v. United States (“Bahlul”). Starting with these rulings, the military commissions system set up by the Bush Administration in 2001 to confer a veneer of legitimacy to Guantánamo began to unravel. David Hicks was the first person to be charged in the initial iteration of these military tribunals. Like Guantánamo itself, this quasi-court system has been an affront to the rule of law and has enabled the U.S. government to evade accountability for torture and unlawful detentions. Hicks v. United States is part of CCR’s broader effort to challenge these abuses.For more on the military commissions system and its undoing, see our factsheet.David Hicks, an Australian citizen, was one of the first men brought to Guantánamo, where he was tortured and held for almost six years. In 1999, Hicks, then 23 years old, converted to Islam and left his homeland to wander the world. His travels took him to Afghanistan, where, shortly after 9/11, he was sold to the U.S. military by the Northern Alliance for a bounty and sent to Guantánamo. In 2002, with representation from the Center for Constitutional Rights and co-counsel Joseph Margulies, he filed one of the first habeas corpus petitions challenging the government's authority to detain individuals at Guantánamo indefinitely without due process. In 2007, under increasing pressure from the Australian government to return its citizen, the U.S. government offered Hicks a plea deal. Desperate to leave Guantánamo after more than five long years of abuse and torture, and knowing that pleading guilty to a war crime would likely be the only sure way out of prison, he accepted the offer and pled guilty to a single “material support” violation, despite having never fired a weapon, and returned to Australia. He lived under a suspended sentence of seven years’ imprisonment, and continues to suffer the burdens and disabilities of his military commission conviction. For more on his story, see our client profile.As of this date, the only two convictions the government has obtained by trial under the military tribunals at Guantánamo have now been vacated (Hamdan) or remain unresolved following vacatur (Al Bahlul). In the wake of these decisions, we argued that Hicks’s conviction should be invalidated on two grounds: (1) as a matter of law the military commission could not convict him for material support; and (2) his guilty plea was involuntary because it was obtained under torture. On February 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Military Commission Review struck down David Hicks's conviction in a unanimous ruling.Case FilesThe appeal brief Opposition to stay motionBriefing Order re jurisdiction Notice of supplemental authority Summary of motion to lift stay and vacate conviction Court Order Order specified issue Hicksv.United States_13-004 Decision_(2015.02.18).pdf United States Court of Military Commission Review~Hicks v.

United States (“Hamdan II”)November 5, 2013CCR files appeal on Hicks’s behalf in U.S. Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR), arguing his conviction for material support must be vacated under Hamdan v. United States (“Hamdan II”)In Hamdan II, the D.C. Circuit held that Salim Hamdan's conviction for material support was unlawful because it was not a war crime at the time of his alleged offense. A few months later, the D.C. Circuit vacated the conviction of another Guantánamo detainee in the case Al Bahlul v. United States, on the government's own admission that none of the charges in that case – material support, conspiracy, and solicitation –  could be considered war crimes under the D.C. Circuit's decision in Hamdan II. In this appeal, we seek to have Hicks’s conviction before the Court of Military Commission Review overturned because it was based on a charge now recognized as impermissible.Press ReleaseFormer Gitmo Prisoner David Hicks Seeks to Vacate ConvictionRelated FilesThe appeal briefLast modified:August 19, 2015Spread the wordTweetShareEmailThe bigger pictureGuantanamoGet the latestEmail *Support CCRJoin us on the front lines for social justice!DonateWhat We DoIssuesAbusive Immigration PracticesCorporate Human Rights AbusesCriminalizing DissentDiscriminatory PolicingDrone KillingsGovernment SurveillanceGuantanamoLGBTQI PersecutionMass IncarcerationMuslim ProfilingPalestinian SolidarityRacial InjusticeSexual and Gender-Based ViolenceTorture, War Crimes, & MilitarismCasesActive CasesHistoric CasesHow We WorkWho We AreGet InvolvedPress CenterInternships and FellowshipsBlogDonate666 Broadway7th FloorNew York, NY 10012Main: 212-614-6464Donations: 212-614-6448Fax: 212-614-6499Contact usPrivacy Policy© 2019 Center for Constitutional RightsConnect With UsGet the latestEmail *
