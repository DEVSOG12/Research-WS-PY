First habeas hearings to be-
gin in October  
 
The first habeas corpus hearings for 
the men held in Guantànamo Bay 
are scheduled to begin in October. 
The hearings were initially scheduled 
to begin on October 6; however, a 
motion to delay for three weeks is 
currently under consideration. The 
first hearings will be held in the 
Boumediene  case, the same case in 
which the Supreme Court ruled in 
June that the detainees at 
Guantànamo have a right to fair ha-
beas hearings before a federal 
judge. 
 
In the habeas hearings, the detain-
ees will challenge the government’s 
detention of them, and the govern-
ment must present sufficient evidence 
to justify their ongoing detention. 
Most of the detainees at 
Guantànamo Bay have now been 
held for over six years. The Boumedi-
ene case includes that of Lakhdar 
Boumediene and five other men, all 
of whom were born in Algeria and 
lived in Bosnia. Five of the men are 
Bosnian citizens. The six men were 
imprisoned in Bosnia in October 
2001; lacking evidence against 
them, the Bosnian supreme court or-
dered their release. Contrary to Bos-
nian law, upon their release they 
were transferred to the custody of 
the United States and have since 
been detained without charge or 
trial at Guantànamo Bay. 
 
These first habeas hearings, pre-
sided over by Judge Richard Leon, a 
very conservative judge and reputed to be the most pro-administration 
judge of those hearing Guantànamo 
detainee cases, of the District Court 
in Washington D.C., will be watched 
closely for their fairness and adher-
ence to the accepted standards of a 
habeas corpus hearing. It is particu-
larly important that in these first hear-
ings, the men are able to present a 
full and comprehensive case for their 
release, and not barred by rulings 
excluding relevant evidence and 
testimony. Unfortunately, we expect 
these hearings will be held in closed 
session, and the men will not be al-
lowed to be present in the courtroom 
for their own hearings, although a 
secure telephone link is expected. 
Most of the rest of the Guantànamo 
detainee cases are before a number 
of other judges in the D.C. District 
Court, and hearings in those cases 
have not yet been scheduled .  
 
The government’s Amended Return, 
entered in the case, is a 187-page 
document, much of which is classi-
fied, laying out the government’s al-
legations against the men. It is, how-
ever, unsigned by any government 
official attesting to the truthfulness or 
the reliability of the allegations con-
tained therein. On September 16, 
2008, attorneys for the Boumediene 
detainees filed a pleading in Judge 
Leon’s court, asking the judge to ei-
ther order a government official to 
sign the document, attesting to the 
truth of the allegations contained, or 
strike the document from the record. 
 
Government Delays in Filing 
Documents in Habeas Cases 
 On August 29, 2008, when the U.S. 
government was expected to file fifty 
sets of amended returns, laying out 
its allegations against the first fifty 
detainees whose habeas cases will 
be heard in federal court, govern-
ment attorneys instead filed only 22 
returns. The government had itself 
requested the August 29 date, over 
the objections of attorneys for the 
men held at Guantànamo, who had 
requested a far-earlier deadline for 
the filing of the papers.  
 
The government, requesting an addi-
tional 30 days extension, stated that 
they could not handle the volume of 
requests due to difficulties handling 
classified information and an insuffi-
cient number of security clearances 
for government attorneys.  
 
Detainees’ attorneys demanded pen-
alties against the government for its 
continued delay in filing. The filing 
delays prevent the cases from mov-
ing forward until the returns are filed.  
 
On September 19, the judge presid-
ing over the cases reluctantly 
granted the government’s request, 
but urged the importance of haste, 
stressing that these men have now 
been held for over six years without 
charge, trial or fair hearing, and that 
further delay is unacceptable. 
 
Uighurs to Have Hearing for 
Parole into the United States 
 
On October 7, Judge Ricardo Ur-
bina will preside over a hearing for 
17 Uighur detainees currently held in 
Guantànamo Bay. The 17 detainees

constitutional 
rights

Center for Constitutional Rights         www.ccrjus tice.org  (continued on  pg. 2) are members of the Uighur ethnic 
minority group in China, a Muslim 
group who face persecution by 
the Chinese government and have 
sought refuge elsewhere in the 
world.  
 
The men have never been 
charged or tried. One of them, 
Huzaifa Parhat, challenged his 
determination of “enemy combat-
ant” under the federal Detainee 
Treatment Act, and his designation 
was overturned by a ruling of the 
court. That ruling has since been 
adopted in four other similar 
Uighur cases.  
 
Judge Urbina has asked the gov-
ernment to decide by September 
30 whether the remaining 12 
Uighurs should be accorded the 
same status. Parhat – joined by 
the four additional Uighurs whose 
“enemy combatant” status has 
been overturned – is arguing on 
October 7 for parole into the 
United States pending resettlement 
into a safe third country. Should 
the other 12 Uighurs’ status also 
be overturned by October 7, they 
will join the motion for parole into 
the United States. 
 
Many faith communities and hu-
man rights advocates in the United 
States have stressed their willing-
ness to support the Uighur detain-
ees if they are paroled into the 
U.S, with financial and other sup-
port. The Uighurs cannot return to 
China, where they face persecu-
tion. 
 
The Uighurs’ attorneys have re-
quested that the detainees not 
designated as enemy combatants 
be granted entry into the United 
States in order to attend their hear-ing and present testimony, a mo-
tion the government is opposing. 
 
Recent Releases from 
Guantànamo 
 
On September 2, two Afghani 
detainees and one Pakistani de-
tainee were transferred to Afghani-
stan and Pakistan, respectively. 
The Pakistani, Mohammad Saad 
Iqbal Madni, who holds Pakistani 
and Egyptian citizenship, was 
seized in Jakarta, Indonesia in 
January 2002 at the behest of the 
CIA, rendered to Egypt where he 
was tortured for three months, 
turned over to the US and sent to 
Afghanistan and held for eleven 
months before being sent to 
Guantànamo, 
 
One of the Afghans, Abdul Wa-
hab, is a 35-year-old farmer, who 
was seemingly suspected based 
on his clothing, common among 
poor Afghan farmers. During mili-
tary “hearings” received by every 
Guantànamo prisoner, he said,  
“Whenever I eat here in the deten-
tion center," he explained to his 
review board, "I am thinking about 
my children, what they have to 
eat. I wish you consider me as a 
normal person and send me 
home, please." When asked what 
he would do if released, he said, 
"When I go home I will make 
some money to buy some food for 
my children if they are alive. If they 
[have not] died already." He also 
reported passing a lie detector 
test, yet remaining imprisoned.  
 
The other Afghan releasee, Ma-
hbub Rahman, was 17 or 18 
years old when he was captured. 
None of the releasees was ever 
charged with any crime or re-ceived any real hearing. 
 
In addition, on August 26, 2008, 
two men, Abdelli Feghoul and 
Mohammed Tarari, were trans-
ferred to Algeria. Both were held 
for 11 days of incommunicado 
detention by the Algerian domes-
tic intelligence and security ser-
vice, charged with “belonging to 
a terrorist organization active 
abroad,” released under judicial 
supervision requiring weekly re-
porting, and are now home with 
their families. 
 
Approximately 255 men remain at 
Guantànamo Bay. 
 
Military Commissions Up-
dates – Khadr trial to begin 
November 10, Obaidullah 
charged 
 
The military commissions trial for 
Omar Khadr, who was arrested 
and detained as a 15-year-old 
juvenile in Afghanistan and cur-
rently faces military commissions 
charges, will begin on November 
10, ruled Col. Patrick Parrish, the 
military judge presiding over the 
case. Khadr, a Canadian citizen 
who was seized in Afghanistan, 
and his attorneys have mounted a 
strong challenge to the govern-
ment’s charges in the military com-
mission proceedings. 
 
Lt. Cmdr. Bill Kuebler, Khadr’s mili-
tary attorney, noted that the trial 
may be pushed back further, as 
the judge has not yet ruled on 
Khadr’s request for an independ-
ent psychiatric assessment of 
Khadr’s mental health, and called 
upon the Canadian government to 
act to protect Khadr’s rights.

government filed new military com-
missions charges against Obaidul-
lah, an Afghan man held at 
Guantànamo. He is accused of 
providing “material support to ter-
rorism” and “conspiracy” to violate 
the laws of war, the latter charge 
relating to allegations that he con-
cealed explosives and allegedly 
had a notebook with information 
about how to wire explosives, 
charges that seem quite minor 
considering the events are alleged 
to have occurred in Afghanistan 
during the course of the U.S. inva-
sion of the country, while the mili-
tary commissions are theoretically 
designed to handle serious “war 
crimes” trials. 
 
Government report on 
deaths released, labels 
deaths suicides 
  
On August 22, 2008, the Naval 
Criminal Investigative Service 
(NCIS) released a report conclud-
ing that the three detainees who 
died at the base on June 10, 
2006 - Saudis Yasser al-Zahrani 
and Mani al-Utaybi, and Yemeni 
Ali Abdullah Ahmed Naser al-
Sulami – died as the result of sui-
cide. The NCIS report included 
the release of over 3,000 pages 
of documents, released as a result 
of a Freedom of Information Act 
lawsuit. 
 
At the time of their deaths, the 
three men had been detained in-
communicado for more than four 
years, without charge or trial, in 
conditions constituting torture and 
cruel and inhuman treatment.  The 
government had cleared al-Utaybi 
for transfer from Guantànamo to 
Saudi Arabia.  Al-Zahrani, who was only 17 at the time of his cap-
ture and 21 when he died, was 
also on the verge of being trans-
ferred to his home country.  The 
government had decided years 
before his death that al-Sulami 
was not someone they could 
p r o s e c u t e . 
 
The U.S. government never di-
rectly notified the men’s families 
that their sons had died.  Al-
Zahrani’s family heard his name 
on television and contacted the 
Saudi Ministry of Interior, which 
confirmed that he was one of the 
deceased.  While Islamic law re-
quires that burials be within 24 
hours of death, the remains of the 
deceased were not returned to 
their home countries until at least 
five days after they died, and with 
missing organs and signs of injury 
and trauma, according to the fami-
lies.  Autopsies were performed 
on the men without notifying their 
families or obtaining the families’ 
c o n s e n t . 
 
Government spokespersons and 
military officials also made a num-
ber of derisive comments about 
the men following their 
deaths.  One official referred to 
the deaths as “a good PR move to 
draw attention.” 
 
Two other men have died in U.S. 
hands at the base – Saudi Abd ar-
Rahman Maadha al-Amry in May 
2007, and Afghan Abdul Razzak 
Hekmati in Dec. 2007, reportedly 
of a treatable disease.  Neither of 
these men was charged, and, like 
the three deaths in June 2006, 
neither of the recent deaths has 
been properly documented or 
accounted for.
