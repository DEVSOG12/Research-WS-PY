There are nowidely agreed overarching standards for all businesses, but instead manydifferent standards that address select human rights, select companies orindustries, or select countries or situations. The result is a messy andinconsistent patchwork of voluntary pledges that have limited application,generally do not fully align with international human rights norms, and in anycase are frequently disregarded in practice.A common global approach is needed to consistently protecthuman rights in the face of business-related abuses and promote conduct bycompanies that respects and advances human rights.This report-the outcome of a project by the Center for HumanRights and Global Justice (CHRGJ) at New York University School of Law andHuman Rights Watch-helps lay the factual foundation for such an approach bydetailing the different ways in which business practices affect human rights.It presents examples drawn from more than 10 years of Human Rights Watchresearch that describe a wide variety of business-related abuses and obstaclesto the justice sought by victims of these abuses.To assist readers in making sense of this diverse set ofmaterials and as an analytical contribution to the literature on business andhuman rights, we have grouped the case material under seven overarchingcategories rooted in core international human rights instruments:·Right to security of the person·Economic and social rights·Civil and political rights·Non-discrimination·Labor rights·Rights of communities or groups includingindigenous peoples·Right to an effective remedy and accountabilityOur key findings include:·Business impacts on human rights are not limitedto sectors that have received the most attention to date, in particular apparelmanufacturing and the extractive industries. Rather, the activities of alltypes of businesses-large and small, domestic and international, public andprivate-in all sectors can implicate human rights. To properly combatbusiness-related human rights abuse, this broader set of actors and contextsneeds to be addressed.·In assessing the impact of business activity onhuman rights, it is important to focus as much on corporate ties with thirdparties that commit abuse (such as suppliers or government security forces) ason cases in which businesses themselves directly cause harm.·Economic interests and other factors can leadgovernments to neglect victims of business-related abuses. If business-relatedabuses are to be curbed, greater attention needs to be paid to governmentalobligations in the face of abuses perpetrated or facilitated by private actors.·Individuals whose rights are affected bybusinesses often are unable to obtain meaningful redress; in too many cases,they face retaliation for even trying. This finding reinforces the need topromote access to justice for victims of business-related abuses and theimportance of further examination of the reasons states are not providingappropriate remedies and reparations.·Many companies have not ascribed to businessstandards addressing relevant human rights and, even when codes of conduct orcommitments to social responsibility exist, they often are not adequatelyimplemented. Additional standards and compliance mechanisms are needed.While this report does not purport to include everybusiness-related human rights abuse documented by Human Rights Watch, let alonereflect incidents of abuse documented by other organizations, of which thereare many, it provides an overview and conceptual framework for understandingthe impacts business activity can have on human rights. It is intended to complementresearch and analysis of these important issues by the United Nations (UN) andothers.[1]Our overarching conclusion is that global intergovernmentalstandards on business and human rights are needed. Such standards will beimportant in their own right and will provide a common framework and a spur fordomestic and other efforts to address the full range of abuses documented below.Background:Understanding the Different Ways Business Activity Can Infringe Human RightsInternationally recognized human rights outlined in corehuman rights instruments guarantee all people equal and inalienable rights byvirtue of their inherent human dignity.[2]These instruments appropriately pay particular attention to the role of states,as the primary duty holder under international law, in upholding these rights.The state's role includes protecting individuals and communities from humanrights abuses committed by businesses and other non-state actors. Businessesand other actors, however, also have responsibilities themselves. As the preamble of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights phrases it, "every organ of society" does.[3]The moral and legal debate over how to define the humanrights responsibilities of businesses tends to be argued on an abstract level. Considerableeffort, for example, has been made to raise awareness about the fundamentalconcept of complicity, under which business may share in responsibility forabuses by third parties, as well as to elaborate on the applicability tobusiness of basic human rights principles. Yet confusion over basic factualmatters persists. At the most fundamental level, there is no shared assessment ofthe extent of the impact that business practices have on human rights. Instead,available information can be interpreted in very different ways.For example, the frequent observation that certainindustries, such as the extractive industries, have faced repeated human rightscontroversies, when presented without reference to examples from a range ofother industries, can form an impression that human rights problems are highlysegmented and limited to a few sectors. By the same token, the specialattention given to the particular problems that can arise in certain businesscontexts, such as areas of violent conflict or so-called weak governance zones,when considered in isolation, can suggest that business-related abuses do notoccur on a global scale. Likewise, the connection between business activity andcertain sets of rights, especially labor rights, can lead to assumptions thatother rights are intrinsically less affected by business practices.The striking nature of some types of abuses in whichcompanies have been implicated, including war crimes, can draw attention awayfrom systematic and entrenched abuses that may be considered unremarkable. Thefrequent and natural tendency to focus on particularly egregious abuses canobscure the fact that many other business impacts on human rights can causeserious harm to affected individuals and communities, particularly when theydisproportionately affect certain groups or exacerbate existing discriminatorypatterns in communities.The lack of common understanding of the nature and scope ofthe problem has important implications. One result is that, to date, manydebates about business responsibility and policies aimed at improving corporateconduct have neglected to fully consider human rights issues. For example, anumber of business initiatives that address human rights have emerged inresponse to specific problems and define their scope accordingly. Theytherefore typically have a limited reach and apply only to individual companiesor industries or particular country contexts.Even within their particular zone of application, moreover,such industry- or region-specific initiatives have not always been fully consistentwith international human rights standards. Indeed, at present there is nowidely recognized set of standards on business and human rights that providesan overarching framework and reference point for these diverse initiatives.In order to foster a more complete understanding of the role,effects, and responsibilities of business in relation to human rights, andthereby to help shape appropriate solutions, it is helpful to take stock of thecross-cutting ways in which enjoyment of rights can be harmed as a result ofbusiness activities.Impacts on human rights may result from such core businessactivities as employing staff, building or utilizing facilities, consuming andmanufacturing materials or providing services, and interacting with communitymembers and governments. As the nature of business operations continues tochange and evolve so too will the ways and contexts in which such operationscan affect human rights.Impacts: A Selection from Reporting by Human Rights WatchThis section analyzes the human rights impacts of businessactivities by grouping examples and case materials from past Human Rights Watchreports into seven overarching categories rooted in core international humanrights instruments:·Right to security of the person·Economic and social rights·Civil and political rights·Non-discrimination·Labor rights·Rights of communities or groups, includingindigenous peoples·Right to an effective remedy and accountabilityThe clustering of rights under these categories is intendedto facilitate an overview of the broad range of rights that are impacted bybusiness activity and does not imply any hierarchy of rights, any rigiddivision between the rights listed under each category, or indeed that anyspecific right could only be included under one category. On the contrary, therights that appear in these different categories remain closely related, andthe categories frequently overlap, reflecting the fact that human rights are bynature universal, indivisible, and interdependent. The prohibition againstdiscrimination, to take the most obvious example, is cross-cutting and appliesin all of the categories.Human rights norms at times explicitly provide forprotections for particular segments of society such as women, children, migrants,or persons with disabilities.[4]These discrete protections have arisen in part as recognition that each ofthese populations may be particularly vulnerable to abuse or exploitation as aresult of marginalization or discrimination. In this report discussion of therights of women, children, migrants, and persons with disabilities isincorporated or "mainstreamed" into the presentation of business impacts underthe various categories identified above. The report retains a distinct categoryonly for communal rights afforded to particular groups, namely minorities andindigenous communities.The descriptions of rights impacts presented below areoffered as illustrations of past occurrences, and not as current accounts ofthe facts. They are not intended to establish responsibility or assign blame. Rather,they serve as a means to achieving a more complete understanding of theproblems that need to be addressed.Right toSecurity of the PersonClick to expand ImageMiners work in the gruelingconditions of an open pit gold mine in Watsa, northeastern Congo. © 2004 Marcus Bleasdale / VIIAs used here, the term "right to security of the person"refers to the right to life and to physical and psychological integrity.[5]Abuses of this right include abuses such as extrajudicial killings, use oflethal or excess force, torture, and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment,including rape and sexual violence.[6]Serious and grave abuses of these rights may amount to crimes underinternational law. Such abuses include war crimes, crimes against humanity,genocide, torture, enforced disappearances, rape, and sexual slavery.[7]Human Rights Watch's research demonstrates that businessinvolvement in such abuses arises in a multitude of contexts. Rights in thiscategory have been affected by businesses both directly and through ties tothird parties who engage in abusive treatment.Human Rights Watch research provides numerous, but notexhaustive, examples of direct abuses carried out in a business context:·Businesses that run or partially staff detentionfacilities have been implicated in abuses of the right to freedom fromill-treatment, for example, when private US contractors at Abu Ghraib prison inIraqwere alleged to have engaged in acts of torture, rape, intimidation, andhumiliation of detainees.[8]·Companies that produce or trade in products thatdirectly impact human rights, such as antipersonnel landmines, have negatively affectedthe right to life.[9]·Supervisors of female agricultural workers inthe US, and of beauticiansand domestic workers in SaudiArabia, have allegedly raped and sexuallyassaulted workers.[10]·Supervisors have beaten children working on Egypt's cotton plantations and in a multitude ofindustries in India.[11]·Employers have made employees work in conditionsthat are degrading or life threatening, for example, in US meat andpoultry processing plants.[12]·Employers have physically abused,psychologically tormented, sexually assaulted, and threatened bodily harmagainst women and child domestic workers in many counties, including Morocco, Singapore,and the United States.[13]In all of these cases, the abuses were accompanied bygovernment failures, at times systemic failures, to protect human rights andensure that perpetrators were held accountable.Businesses also can be implicated in abuses through theirties to third parties: if they fail to ensure that their operations do notdepend upon, benefit from, or contribute to human rights abuses committed byothers, they risk being complicit in those abuses. Situations that can giverise to responsibility for human rights abuses range from outright collusionbetween the company and the abuser to instances of corporate indifference tohuman rights. Companies have affected the right to physical and psychologicalintegrity through their ties to security forces, including government securityforces as well as private security forces.Human Rights Watch has reported on numerous incidentsassociated with company security arrangements, such as the following:·Companies in Indonesia's pulp and paper industryhave hired private thugs who intimidate or assault members of neighboringcommunities; government security personnel who receive funding from thecompanies have assisted or acquiesced in these attacks.[14]·Government and private security forces haveresponded with excessive, sometimes lethal, force against striking workers in China's heavy industries and protestersdemonstrating against a massive power plant in Indiaand oil companies in Nigeria.[15]·In Colombia, a variety of businesses-rangingfrom multinational corporations in agricultural and extractives sectors tolocal cattle-ranching businesses-have been implicated in killings and otherviolence against trade unionists through their ties to paramilitary groups.[16]In addition, oil companies operating in Colombia have used highly abusivestate and private security forces to secure their facilities.[17]Companies also have been implicated in abuses by thirdparties in many other contexts. For example:·Both public and private arms trading andtransport companies in Europe, Central Asia, and elsewhere have provided lethalmilitary equipment to highly abusive governments or armed groups that aresubject to arms embargoes or otherwise should be blocked from receiving weaponsbased on the risk of their misuse.[18]·Companies have provided logistical or othersupport to known human rights abusers that enable more abuses. For example, governmentforces used oil company infrastructure in southern Sudan to carry out attacks targetingcivilians and to wage indiscriminate and disproportionate military attacks thatdestroyed entire villages and displaced thousands of people.[19]Two Human Rights Watch reports addressing the businessimpacts on the right to security of the person are described in more detailbelow.The Curse of Gold:Democratic Republicof Congo[20]Localand international business activity has been part of the dynamic of power andviolence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A 2005 Human Rights Watchreport showed how companies involved in the mining and trading of gold werelinked to human rights through their ties to warlords who control goldmines inthe northeast corner of DRC. In one case AngloGold Ashanti, one of the world's largestgold producers, decided to explore for gold in northeastern DRC withoutadequately considering human rights.Inorder to gain access to the gold-rich area, and in return for assurances ofsecurity for its operation and staff, AngloGold Ashanti provided logistical,financial, and political support to a murderous armed group that controlled thearea. The company did so at a time when it was widely known that the armedgroup was responsible for grave abuses, including war crimes and crimes againsthumanity. The group, led by a brutal warlord, flaunted its guns in the streets,forced people to work in the gold mines in miserable conditions, and conductedkilling sprees and used torture in nearby villages.Thecompany had in place a corporate code of conduct that included human rightsstandards and made public commitments to corporate social responsibility, butin developing ties with the Congolese warlords the company failed to uphold itsown business principles to ensure that its activities did not adversely affecthuman rights.Thebusiness activities of a set of companies that purchased gold mined in DRC alsoaffected human rights, providing a revenue stream for the abusive armed groups.A network of smugglers illegally funneled gold out of DRC to Uganda, where it was bought by multinationalcompanies in Switzerlandand elsewhere. The companies that purchased gold from this network knew, orshould have known, that it came from a conflict zone in DRC where human rightswere being abused on a systematic basis.OneSwiss company, Metalor, claimed it actively checked its supply chain to verifythat acceptable ethical standards were being maintained, yet bought gold fromthe network for five years without raising serious questions about itsprovenance. The proceeds from the international sale of this gold providedlocal warlords in DRC with the means to gain access to money, guns, and powerto perpetuate their reign of terror on local villagers.Hopes Betrayed:Trafficking of Women and Girls to Post-Conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina for ForcedProstitution[21]Duringthe conflict in Bosnia andHerzegovina from 1992 through 1995,thousands of women and girls suffered rape and other forms of sexual violence.The grim sexual slavery of the war years was followed by the trafficking ofwomen and girls for forced prostitution. As described in a November 2002report, Human Rights Watch found substantial evidence that employees of a UScorporation were involved in human trafficking.In1999 DynCorp, a US-based government contractor working under contract with theNATO-led Security Forces (SFOR), repatriated a group of contractors afterallegations emerged that the men had "purchased" women from local brothels forthe purpose of sexual and domestic slavery. Again in 2000 two DynCorpcontractors returned home after the US Army Criminal Investigation Division(CID) learned of allegations of the purchase of women and weapons from localbrothel owners. The CID investigation uncovered evidence of their involvementin the abuses that violated the women's right to physical integrity and freedomfrom torture or other inhumane treatment. In one case, a DynCorp sitesupervisor was apparently caught on tape raping a woman; in another case, aDynCorp employee withheld the passport of a woman he "purchased."WhenHuman Rights Watch looked into these cases in 2002 it found that there had beenno prosecutions against DynCorp employees in either Bosniaand Herzegovina or the US for criminal activities relatedto trafficking. In 2007 the problem of impunity of US government contractors forabuses committed overseas had yet to be adequately addressed, as evident incontractor scandals in Afghanistan and Iraq (addressed further below).Economic andSocial Rights-An injured meatpacking worker athome with her husband. The serious injury rate in the meatpacking industry isabout five times the national average, making it the most dangerous job in America. © 1999Eugene Richards / VIIEconomic and social rights[22]relate to the right of all humans to the basic necessities of life, including butnot limited to food, water, social security, clothing, health care, education,and housing.[23]Businesses have affected this category of rights in myriad ways.Human Rights Watch research provides several examples ofbusiness conduct that has negatively affected economic and social rights,including the following:·A US company has declined to haltsupplies of bulldozers that the Israeli army has used in the occupiedPalestinian territories to raze homes, destroy agriculture, and shred roads inviolation of the laws of war and with serious consequences for people's accessto adequate food and housing.[24]·Employers in Ukraine have arbitrarily limited economicopportunities for women, perpetuating poverty and reinforcing discrimination.[25]·Construction employers in the United ArabEmirates (UAE) have subjected their employees to housing and working conditionsdangerous to their health and safety and failed to accurately report workerinjuries and deaths.[26]·US meatpacking-industry employers have preventedworkers who suffer injuries from seeking treatment at plant health clinicsunless their wounds were traumatic and visible.[27]·Transnational labor recruitment agencies basedin Indonesiahave confined prospective domestic workers at training facilities for months inovercrowded and unsanitary facilities where women have little or no access tohealth care, are deprived of adequate food and rest, and at times sufferphysical and sexual abuse as well as anxiety and depression associated withtheir ill-treatment.[28]A Taiwanese company dumped toxic waste in Cambodia,which led to at least one death and undermined local residents' rights toenvironmental, health, and livelihood protections.[29]Government-managed cotton cooperatives used hazardouspesticides in Egypt'scotton fields without adequate protection for the child laborers whosehealth was at risk.[30]Plantations in El Salvador have employedchildren to carry out inherently dangerous work in sugarcane fields,endangering their right to health.[31]Businessesin El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt,and the United Stateshave undermined working children's right to an education by limiting theirability to attend school.[32]Additional examples show that businesses have also negativelyimpacted people's right to water, which can also affect their rights to life, health,food, and livelihood:·A USenergy company's diversion of large quantities of water left villagers in India withbarely enough water to sustain themselves, sparking protests that were then systematicallysuppressed.[33]·US agricultural employers have not providedchild workers with adequate drinking water and sanitation facilities, withserious negative effects on the children's health.[34]·Pollution from Nigeria's oil industry has severelyaffected the livelihood of local communities, ruining crops, destroying fishinggrounds, and damaging drinking water supplies.[35]Twoexamples detailed below illustrate additional impacts.Forgotten Schools: Rightto Basic Education for Children on Farms in South Africa[36]In a 2004 report on South Africa,Human Rights Watch examined public schools located on private commercial farms thatare the only accessible sites of education for many children who live on thefarms with their parents or relatives. The investigation found that, despite someefforts to improve practices, farm owners' actions were interfering with manychildren's ability to attend school.These South African farmschools, which at the time constituted 13 percent of all state-funded schoolsand educated approximately 3 percent of public school students, are a legacy ofthe apartheid era. At the end of the apartheid period, half of the Africanchildren living on white-owned commercial farms were not enrolled in school. Whereasfarm owners originally established and managed schools as they saw fit, effortswere made starting in 1994 to convert the farm schools to ordinarygovernment-managed public schools with limited farm owner responsibility.Human Rights Watch'sreport revealed that some private farm owners were deliberately obstructing children'sphysical access to schools or preventing schools from functioning by suspendingtheir water supply. In other cases, farm owners had closed schools in anattempt to evict workers whose children attended the farm school on their property.While government officials and police occasionally intervened in such cases totry to ensure children's access to schools, such interventions were ofteninsufficient.Without Remedy: HumanRights Abuse and Indonesia'sPulp and Paper Industry[37]The massive pulp andpaper industry located in Riau province on the islandof Sumatra, Indonesia,has decimated huge swathes of Sumatra'slowland and tropical forests. A 2003 Human Rights Watch report showed that theenvironmental destruction also harmed the local population, which is largely rural,poor, and dependent on the forests for its livelihood.Many local communities inRiau use the affected lands for subsistence and for commercial cultivation ofdryland rice and tree crops, while millions of others depend on income fromrubber or other forest products. Human Rights Watch found that the wholesaledestruction of forests by pulp and paper companies in Riau, together with theirreliance on employees from outside the province, made it increasingly difficultfor members of forest-dependent communities to seek a livelihood and adequatestandard of living. These problems were compounded for indigenous communitiesfor whom the forests hold great cultural value.When community membersattempted to directly challenge company practices, they faced unresponsivecourts and unaccountable and often brutal government security forces andcompany-sponsored militias. Corruption contributed to the government's failureto protect those seeking to investigate and publicize human rights abuses andenvironmental crimes.Civil andPolitical RightsClick to expand ImageA man standsnext to a poster advertising USinternet search engine Yahoo in a Beijingsubway station. © 2006 AFPThis category of rights encompasses rights to personal andpolitical liberties.[38]It includes, among others, the right to liberty of the person (includingfreedom from arbitrary arrest and detention), freedom of peaceful assembly,freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of information, freedom of movement,freedom of religion, the right to property, the right to found a family, andthe right to privacy.[39]Contrary to the commonly held view that business activities have little to dowith civil and political rights, these rights frequently have been affected bycompanies in a variety of contexts, as shown in various Human Rights Watchreports.Examples of business impacts on civil and political rights include:·Employers and transnational labor recruitmentagents in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,the United Arab Emirates,and the UShave denied workers' freedom of movement by forcibly confining them andconfiscating their passports or other identity papers.[40]·Oilcompanies have not fully and publicly disclosed their payments to the Angolangovernment, compromising the Angolan public's right to information and, by helpingto entrench undemocratic and unaccountable rule, impeding their right toparticipation in public life as well. Banks that have provided the Angolangovernment with oil-backed loans without transparency also have contributed tothe problem.[41]·A company security force in Indonesia has usedintimidation tactics, beat several people, destroyed and stole property, anddetained villagers in an effort to silence opposition to the company's loggingactivities; such abuses have impeded, among other rights, the villagers' rightsto property, to be free from arbitrary detention, and to exercise theirfreedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.[42]·Private security forces hired by commercialfarms in South Africa,[43]business owners in Guatemala,[44]oil companies in Nigeria,[45]land developers in Angola,[46]and the US government in Iraq have usedintimidation and excessive force against local residents.[47]·Private security guards in Burundi routinelyhave held hospital patients against their will in state hospitals until theyhave provided payment.[48]Many company practices impinge on the right to privacy, asshown by the following examples:·Employers in a variety of industries in Botswana, Namibia,Zambia, and Zimbabwehave targeted individuals who defy gender and cultural norms, interrogated themabout their sexual orientation, and often fired them if they answered honestly.Those who managed to retain their jobs frequently have faced serious harassmentat the workplace.[49]·Employers in the tourism and export processingindustries in the DominicanRepublic have mandated HIV testing as acondition to obtain or retain a job.[50]·Romanian private and public employers have requiredthat job applicants undergo medical examinations (at times including HIV tests)not required by law.[51]·Employers in the US have spied on workers, in somecases to unlawfully monitor union activity.[52]·Employers in the export processing industry in Guatemala and Mexico have mandated pregnancy testingfor prospective workers and as a condition of continued employment.[53]Two case studies summarized below provide additionalexamples of business actions that impede civil and political rights.Race to the Bottom:Corporate Complicity in Chinese Internet Censorship[54]China's systemof Internet censorship and surveillance is the most advanced in the world andis often aided by extensive private sector cooperation. Companies such asGoogle, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Skype, seeking access to the lucrative Chinesemarket, have assisted and reinforced the Chinese government's system ofarbitrary, opaque, and unaccountable political censorship.Asdescribed in an August 2006 Human Rights Watch report, these companies not onlyhave responded to instructions and pressure from Chinese authorities to censortheir materials; they also have actively engaged in self-censorship by usingtheir technology to predict the material they believe the Chinese governmentwould want them to censor and then preemptively block users from accessing thatmaterial. Through such actions, these companies have been complicit in theChinese government's censorship of political and religious information and itsmonitoring of dissent.Thecompanies have all accepted at least some Chinese government demands withoutmounting a meaningful challenge to them. By blocking search content, allowingChinese officials access to private civilians' email accounts, and censoringnews stories, these companies have assisted the Chinese government in violatingindividuals' right to privacy, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedomto receive and impart information.Informationthat companies have provided to Chinese authorities has also been used to jailcritics; court documents obtained by human rights groups showed that, as ofmid-2006, user data handed over by Yahoo! to Chinese law enforcement officialshad assisted in the arrest and conviction of at least four people.The Enron Corporation:Corporate Complicity in Human Rights Violations[55]Human rights abusesplagued the Enron Corporation's Dabhol power plant in India in the 1990s. Localopposition to the Enron project began in 1992 over concerns about corruptionand the hasty negotiations of the terms of Enron's investment in itssubsidiary, the Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC). Farmers complained that DPC hadunfairly acquired their land and had diverted scarce water for its needs. Localactivists raised concerns over potential environmental damage. DPC ignored ordismissed such concerns.Villagers tried variousavenues to address their concerns about the project-including direct dialoguewith the company and judicial proceedings-without success. The government of Maharashtra state, where the power plant was located,also ignored public complaints. As opposition grew, DPC paid local police forsecurity. Those police forces arrested, harassed, and intimidated critics of theDPC power plant. The company's critics, including leading Indian environmentalactivists and village representatives, were subjected to beatings anddetentions. In one instance in May 1997, police beat and arrested nearly 180protesters who were demonstrating peacefully outside the company gates. Inaddition, contractors working for DPC engaged in a pattern of harassment,intimidation, and violence against individuals opposed to the power project,including by carrying out two attacks and issuing one death threat.Throughout thecontroversy, DPC denied any wrongdoing by the company or its contractors andmaintained that it bore no responsibility for abuses by police. The company,however, could not have been ignorant of the abuses committed by police whom DPCpaid and who were stationed at the site for the sole purpose of dealing withthe protests. Police refused to investigate complaints and in several casesactually arrested the victims on trumped-up charges.Non-Discrimination-Dalit women honor the late Dr. B. R.Ambedkar, who spent his life fighting "untouchability" and other forms of castediscrimination. © 2006 Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesAll human beings are entitled to fair and equal treatmentand freedom from discrimination.[56]The prohibition against discrimination applies in respect of all rights. Itencompasses discrimination on the basis of gender, race, nationality, or otherstatus.Nondiscrimination in the workplace is enshrined as a corelabor right (as addressed further below).[57]Businesses can also engage in harmful discrimination in other contexts as well,such as by arbitrarily refusing service to particular categories of customers.Illustrations of improper discrimination include, amongothers:·A state-owned gold company in DRC has favoredworkers from one ethnic group over another in compensation and promotions.[58]·Employers in the Dominican Republic have blatantlydiscriminated against workers based on their actual or perceived HIV status.[59]·Saudi employers, consistent with prevailinggender segregation, have forcibly confined many low-paid women migrant workers,including those who work in hospitals and dress shops.[60]The mistreatment in Saudi Arabiaof migrant workers from Asia and Africa also hasbeen aggravated by deeply rooted religious and racial discrimination.[61]·A variety of businesses-and particularly bars,pubs, and clubs-in several southern African countries have openly discriminatedon the basis of sexual orientation. These discriminatory practices also havehelped create a climate of intimidation that has contributed to violence, inwhich staff and other patrons in these establishments have assaulted lesbians,gay men, bisexuals, and transgender (LGBT) individuals.[62]·Wal-Mart has been accused of illegal sex anddisability discrimination in the United States, and its efforts tosqueeze out long-term employees who command higher wages have had a disparateimpact on older employees.[63]·Companies in Guatemala's export assembly or"maquila" industry have engaged in persistent sex discrimination and abuseagainst women workers.[64]·In the same industry in Mexico,employers have routinely forced female job applicants to undergo pregnancyscreening, usually through urine tests, as a precondition for employment.[65]·Employers in Guatemalaand Mexico'sexport processing plants also have fired women workers or forced them to resignif they became pregnant. In addition to being discriminatory on the basis ofgender, such acts are also contrary to provisions of international human rightslaw that afford additional protections to pregnant women.[66]Two additional examples are summarized in more detail below.Women's Work:Discrimination against Women in the Ukrainian Labor Force[67]Widespreademployment discrimination against women in Ukraine inhibits women's access tojobs, including many stable and well-compensated positions, and limits women'schoices as to where they can seek work. Employers in both the public andprivate sectors regularly specify gender requirements when advertisingvacancies and use information regarding family circumstances to deny womenemployment.Employersjustify their preferences for male employees on stereotypical assumptions aboutwomen's physical and intellectual capacities and their family responsibilities.As a result, women are increasingly pushed into low-wage service sector orpublic sector jobs or seek employment in the unregulated informal sector. Ageand appearance requirements also arbitrarily exclude women from jobs for whichthey are professionally qualified.Givenlimited employment options in Ukraine,many women choose to go abroad to seek better economic opportunities, but theirchoice may leave them vulnerable to being trafficked into the commercial sexindustry or other forms of forced labor. While these various discriminatorypractices violate both international and Ukrainian domestic laws, governmentofficials have done little to uphold the rights of women in the Ukrainian laborforce. In a 2003 report on the problem, Human Rights Watch found that Ukrainianemployers demonstrated little knowledge of basic Ukrainian law as well as anunwillingness to apply laws that they knew to exist.Hidden Apartheid: Caste DiscriminationAgainst India's "Untouchables"[68]India is hometo 165 million Dalits, or so-called untouchables, who are relegated to thebottom of a rigid caste system and subjected to extreme social stigma. In allaspects of their lives, Dalits are physically segregated from non-Dalitsbecause of their "untouchable" status. Despite constitutional protections andlegislative prohibitions that nominally protect them, Dalits sufferdiscrimination on the basis of work and descent. Reporting by Human RightsWatch and CHRGJ has helped reveal the ways that businesses in Indiaperpetuate this form of "hidden apartheid." Businesses reinforce the unfairtreatment accorded Dalits both through biased service provision and by severelyrestricting Dalits' job opportunities in accordance with the prevailing castehierarchy.Throughout India manybusinesses refuse Dalits access to their services or facilities. One 2007 studyillustrated the widespread nature of such discriminatory practices: it revealedthat Dalits are often not allowed to sell milk to cooperatives, are deniedbarber, laundry, tailoring, and carpentry services, and are refused entry torestaurants and hotels, private health clinics, and cinemas, all on the basisof their caste. In one-fifth of the villages surveyed, shops forbid Dalits fromtouching anything during transactions.Caste-baseddiscrimination also helps fuel exploitation of labor at the hands of bothprivate and public employers, including businesses. Dalits are routinely forcedinto dangerous and degrading work, often for little or no pay. In keeping withthe practice of caste inequality, employers routinely deny free choice ofemployment and instead strictly assign labor on the basis of caste, assigning Dalitsto jobs considered too "polluting" for others. Most notably, an estimated 1.3millions Dalits in Indiawork for both public and private employers as manual scavengers, a position sodegrading that it has been officially outlawed. The workers in these postsendure dangerous and humiliating work, including manually collecting humanwaste, often without the benefit of protective gear.Many Dalits, includingchildren, are consigned to work as bonded laborers, while tens of millions ofDalits find work as landless agricultural laborers earning less than US$1 aday. Upper-caste landowners frequently use caste as a cover for exploitativeeconomic arrangements. Laws designed to prohibit and eradicate exploitativelabor arrangements,untouchabilitypractices, and other forms of caste-based abuse are openly flouted and seldomenforced, reflecting continuing social prejudice. Attemptsby Dalits to demand their rights, including their labor rights, are routinelymet with retaliatory violence and economic boycotts, often taking the form ofcollective punishment of entire Dalit communities for the perceivedtransgressions of a few.Labor RightsClick to expand ImageForeign laborers work to build theJumeirahBeachluxury apartment complex in Dubai,United Arab Emirates.© 2006 Abbas/Magnum PhotosLabor rights encompass the right to work as well as theenjoyment of rights at work.[69]International law recognizes four "core" labor rights: freedom of associationand the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; theelimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; the effective abolitionof child labor; and the elimination of discrimination with respect toemployment and occupation.[70]Additionally, other economic and social labor rights, including occupational healthand safety, compensation in cases of occupational injuries and illness, and minimumwage standards are also reflected in international instruments,[71]as are special protections for mothers, pregnant women, and children in theworkplace.[72]Human Rights Watch has extensively reported on abuses ofworkers' human rights in many contexts:·Employers have used children to carry out dangerousagricultural work in Ecuador,Egypt, El Salvador, India,and South Africain violation of international standards, which provide for a minimum age ofemployment and prohibit hazardous work.[73]·A range of industries in China, Ecuador,Guatemala, North Korea, and the United States, among other places,have compromised workers' freedom of association.[74]For example, employers in Ecuadorhave impeded workers' organizing drives by taking advantage of legal loopholesthat allow the unlimited use of subcontracted labor.[75]·Employers and recruiters in Saudi Arabia, SouthAfrica, the United ArabEmirates, the United States, and elsewhere haveabused migrant workers.[76]In several of those cases, transnational labor recruiters and private laborsubcontracting companies have placed migrants in debt bondage, a situation akinto forced labor.[77]·Businesses in Brazil,DRC, and India,among others, have practiced forms of servitude and slavery, including forcedlabor and debt bondage.[78]·Human trafficking for forced labor has takenplace in many countries, including Bosnia,Greece, Guinea, Japan,Thailand, Togo, and the US.[79]·In Indonesia,labor recruitment companies often confine women seeking to migrate to Malaysia fordomestic employment at training centers for months prior to their departure,deceiving the women about the type of work they are to perform, the salary theywill receive, and the terms and conditions of their work. They also withholdwomen's wages while they remain at the training centers. In many cases, thepractices amount to trafficking in persons.[80]·Companies operating in a variety of differentbusiness sectors and a range of countries-including agriculture plantations inEl Salvador, construction firms in the UAE, mining companies in DRC, foodprocessing plants in the US, and manufacturing operations in India-have createdhazardous working conditions, contrary to their employees' rights to a safe andhealthy working environment.[81]·In India,Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the US, employers have engaged in wageexploitation, such as payment of wages below minimum standards and excessivesalary reductions.[82]·Employers in the US and the UAE, among others,have forced employees to work long hours, prevented employees from changingjobs, or given misinformation in the hiring process, affecting the right tojust and favorable conditions of work, including free choice of work.[83]·In the United States, employers havecommitted labor rights violations in a variety of industries, from retail tomanufacturing to agriculture to meat processing to domestic employment inprivate homes.[84]Three cases involving labor rights are discussed in more detailbelow.Discounting Rights:Wal-Mart's Violation of US Workers' Right to Freedom of Association[85]Ina 2007 report Human Rights Watch showed how Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the largestcompany in the world and also the largest private employer in the United States, relentlessly exploits weak US labor laws to thwart the right of its US workers to form and join trade unions at its4,000 USstores. Wal-Mart employs a sophisticated and determined strategy to preventunion activity at its USstores and, when that strategy fails, quashes organizing wherever it starts.Thecompany has sometimes illegally disciplined and fired union supporters. Moreoften, it has resorted to subtle but equally effective tactics to defeatorganizing. For example, the company has called the police to stop unionrepresentatives leafleting outside its stores, snatched pro-union informationfrom workers' hands and from break room tables, and banned talk about unions.The cumulative effect of Wal-Mart's panoply of anti-union tactics is to depriveits workers of their internationally recognized right to organize.Inmany cases, the company is able to deny its USworkers their right to form and join unions without ever violating weak US labor laws.In violation of international standards, US law generally does not requirethat workers be given the chance to fully inform themselves of their right tounionize. Even when the authorities find Wal-Mart guilty of illegal conduct,the company faces no fines or punitive sanctions under US labor laws,so there is little to deter illegal anti-union activity in the future.BuildingTowers, Cheating Workers:Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in the UAE[86]The United Arab Emirateshosted at least half a million migrant construction workers in 2006 when it wasundergoing one of the world's largest construction booms. These migrant workersfaced wage exploitation, indebtedness to unscrupulous recruiters, and workingconditions that are hazardous to the point of being deadly. UAE federal laborlaw nominally offers a number of protections, but employers largely ignore themin the case of migrant construction workers.According to a 2006Human Rights Watch report, employers paid construction workers extremely lowwages and typically withheld payment for a minimum of two months as "security"to keep them from quitting. In many cases employers also withheld workers'passports for the same reason, restricting their freedom of movement. Compoundingthese problems is the fact that employers often fail to pay recruiting andtravel fees (which UAE law obligates them to pay), instead forcing workers topay these costs by incurring extremely high debts in their home countries; insome cases workers have had to work for years just to repay these fees. Someworkers are not paid at all for several months at a time. Workers engaged inthe hazardous work of constructing high-rises face high rates of injury anddeath with little assurance that their employers will cover their healthcareneeds. Finally, workers in the UAE are denied the ability to organize andbargain collectively, core labor rights that would give them a tool to combatsuch abuses themselves.The UAE federalgovernment has done little or nothing to address the troubled workingconditions faced by the construction workers. It has failed to create adequatemechanisms to investigate, prosecute, penalize, or remedy breaches of applicableUAE laws. Aggrieved workers are entitled to seek a hearing before the Ministryof Labor, which arbitrates disputes and refers unresolved cases to thejudiciary, but arbitration remains a limited option, so much so that governmentofficials have themselves criticized the process as inadequate and in need ofurgent reform.Underage and Unprotected:Child Labor in Egypt'sCotton Fields[87]A 2001 Human RightsWatch report found that each year Egypt's agriculturalcooperatives-which are effectively government entities-hired over one millionchildren between the ages of 7 and 12 to take part in cotton pest management;children form a particularly high proportion of the wage labor force for cottoncultivation in the country. These cooperatives, though formally established asparticipatory institutions in which membership is mandatory for most farmers,in effect operate as local arms of the agriculture ministry. Most of thechildren employed by these cooperatives were well below Egypt's minimumage of 12 for seasonal agricultural work.Children typicallyworked 11 hours a day, including a one to two hour break, seven days a week-farin excess of limits set by the Egyptian Child Law. Labor recruitment efforts inboth small and large farms targeted children almost exclusively, because their heightcorresponded to the height of the plants during certain seasons and because itis easier to control children and hire them at a lower wage. Human Rights Watchfound that most children in leafworm control work in the cotton fields camefrom the villages' poorer families, suggesting a correlation between theirfamilies' economic circumstances and their own willingness to accept seasonalwork.The disproportionateemployment by cooperatives of the poorest rural children means that the latterare especially vulnerable to the ill-treatment, long hours, and health hazardsassociated with combating pests that attack the cotton plant. Although Egypt hasadopted its own Child Law, as well as signed the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child, the cooperatives run by the agriculture ministry continued toperpetrate these abuses.Rights ofCommunities or Groups including Indigenous Peoples-Police detain a demonstratorduring a protest in downtown Santiago against aproject to build a hydroelectric      plant on land in southern Chile owned by Mapuche Indians. ©2002 Santiago Llanquin/AP PhotoThis category addresses the rights that members of certaingroups hold jointly, by virtue of their shared membership in a community. Humanrights principles, as noted previously, can provide special protections forthose who may be particularly vulnerable due to their social, economic, orcultural marginalization. Whereas in some cases these rights are exercised byindividuals in their capacity as members of a group-such as is the case formigrants or children, for example-in other cases the rights are by their naturecollective rights enjoyed by a community as a whole. This category is concernedwith the latter set of rights and in particular addresses the rights of groupssuch as indigenous peoples.[88]The rights of indigenous peoples include the right torecognition of traditional ownership, occupation and use of land, and the rightto cultural identity.[89]Measures to protect other groups at particular risk, such as minorities, areembedded not only in general human rights provisions regardingnon-discrimination and equality but also in specific instruments forminorities' rights covering, for example, the rights to practice theirlanguage, religion and culture, and to participate in the decisions that affectthem.[90]The activities of businesses often have a disproportionateeffect on the communal rights of minorities and indigenous groups. Severalreports offer illustrations regarding these often-disadvantaged groups:·In Indonesia private andmilitary-owned businesses have benefited from the relocation of indigenous communitiesfrom traditional land without their free and informed consent or due processprotections. Given that that these indigenous communities ascribe greatcultural value to forests, business projects that destroy or block access to traditionalland also affect their cultural rights.[91]·Businesses have routinely refused to hiremembers of Roma communities in Maced0nia, compounding the effect of highunemployment and forcing them to seek work in the "black economy."[92]·In ethnically Tibetan areas in China,authorities have forcibly relocated Tibetan herders to make way for mining,infrastructure projects, or urban development without their free and informedconsent or due process protections.[93]·Businesses in a number of countries-often actingin collusion with state security forces-have forcibly evicted indigenousfarmers and vulnerable communities from their land, depriving them of access toessential resources and threatening their subsistence.[94]Undue Process: TerrorismTrials, Military Courts, and the Mapuche in Southern Chile[95]A 2004 Human Rights Watchreport describes violations of due process in trials of members of Chile's largestindigenous group, the Mapuche, for crimes committed during land conflicts inthe Araucanía region. Business activities served as a spark for the conflicts.The Mapuche wereprofoundly affected by the expansion of investment in forestry, hydroelectricprojects, and road construction into their traditional lands during the 1990s.Mapuche community members complained that the massive commercial plantationsthat encircled their communities harmed the ecosystems on which theirtraditional life depended, including by depriving them of forest plants usedfor medicinal and ritual needs. Tensions also rose in relation to a hydroelectricproject built by the national electricity company over the objections of thelocal indigenous community. The Mapuche viewed these developments as a threatto their way of life, and they fiercely opposed what they consideredencroachment in ancestral Mapuche land.Despite efforts toaddress the underlying problems, in many areas the relationship between thecommunities, on the one side, and the forestry companies and government, on theother, continued to deteriorate. Protests by the Mapuche grew more violent atthe end of the 1990s, with clashes between groups occupying disputed land andthe police, as well as widespread attacks by Mapuche militants on the privateproperty of timber companies and landowners, sometimes costing millions ofdollars. All such crimes committed were already serious offenses under thecriminal code, but the government-under pressure from southern landowners, theforestry companies, and the political opposition to act with a firmer handagainst Mapuche protesters-instead prosecuted Mapuche under a counterterrorismstatute lacking due process protections. In cases involving violence againstpolice, authorities tried them in military courts not meeting the basicrequirements of independence and impartiality.Malaysia: An Unholy Alliance of Politics and Logging[96]A joint report on the environment and human rights issued byHuman Rights Watch and the National Resources Defense Council described howtimber companies and government officials, acting together to dispossessindigenous communities for their own gain, endangered the survival ofindigenous communities in Malaysia's once-vast Borneo rainforest.In the state of Sarawak,Malaysia,indigenous people constituted nearly 50 percent of the population at the timethe time the report was researched in 1992. By that year, voracious logging ofthe rainforest by timber companies had already destroyed much of the rainforestthat these communities depended on for their survival.The indigenous people of Malaysia had a recognized legalright to their native land under federal Malaysian law. In practice, however,the Malaysian government made it difficult and prohibitively expensive forthese communities to assert native land claims. Other rules made it easy forstate governments to overturn indigenous land rights. Using this authority,state officials took over millions of hectares of communal land and dividedmost of it into logging concessions. Most of the profit from logging went tostate officials, which gave them a direct financial incentive to redistributeindigenous land. They would frequently distribute the concessions to theirclose associates and in some cases to companies they owned themselves.In this way, local indigenous communities in the rainforestfound themselves pitted against Malaysian timber companies and their governmentbackers. The Penan ethnic group, a hunter-gatherer society in Sarawak,and most other indigenous communities in the area were entirely dependant onthe rainforest for food, medicine, and shelter, as well as to maintain theircustoms and way of life. As timber companies arrived to clear trees from theirtraditional lands, they staged non-violent protests, primarily in the form ofhuman blockades to obstruct logging roads. The timber companies responded bydispatching hired vigilantes to terrorize the protesters with menacing behaviorand threats. When that did not work, state security forces arrived to arrestthe indigenous blockade participants on criminal charges of obstructing loggingactivities, confining them in miserable conditions of detention. The timbercompanies were then free to continue logging seven days a week, 24 hours a day.The resulting land erosion, water contamination, and extinction of wildlife andplant species further threatened the precarious existence of the indigenouscommunities and the extinction of their ancient cultures.Right to an Effective Remedy and AccountabilityClick to expand ImageResidents of Katalwadi village in India stand near Enron's Dabholpower plant (in the background). When some villagers protested against thepower plant, contractors for the company and police retaliated against them. ©1999 Arvind GanesanVictims of human rights abuses are entitled to an effectiveremedy that offers redress for the harm suffered. This can encompass, amongothers, the right of access to courts, the right to a fair trial, the right toequal protection under the law, the right to seek reparation and satisfaction,and the right to enforcement of judgments.[97]These rights of victims, however, are rarely upheld againstthe interests of powerful companies. In many cases, governments fail even toprovide the means to hold business actors accountable (such as by failing toensure the requisite legislation exists). Governments may also fail to enforceexisting laws or regulations that would in practice help to protect humanrights. In some cases, businesses use their political and economic clout toensure government inaction.The various reports touched on above contain examples of obstaclesto justice faced by victims of business-related abuses. Two examples areexplored here in more detail.A Job or Your Rights:Continued Sex Discrimination in Mexico'sMaquiladora Sector[98]A 1996 Human RightsWatch report on Mexicoshowed little government oversight of the maquiladora (export assembly) sector.The government did not enforce domestic prohibitions on sex discrimination and itfailed to provide mechanisms for investigation or adjudication of complaints. Avoluntary pledge by one US-owned company to stop conducting mandatoryemployment-related pregnancy testing in its factories also failed to achievethe change sought by the victims: pregnancy-based sex discrimination continuedthe following year, and the company failed to put in place a concrete plan to monitorcompliance with its new policy.The Enron Corporation:Corporate Complicity in Human Rights Violations[99]Theexample of DPC and its parent company Enron in India, discussed at length above,is also informative. The company was allegedly able to bypass review proceduresand secure approvals for the Dabhol project despite overwhelming oppositionfrom area residents and some government regulators because it engaged incorruption and collusion with other officials. Communities faced difficulty gettinga fair hearing in the courts in part due to alleged political favoritism shownto the company.Thestate government of Maharashtra, which hadpreviously filed a suit against Enron on the grounds of corruption in securingthe DPC project, was convinced to reverse its position and drop the claim aftera renegotiation of the project with Enron. The terms of the new agreement werein some ways more onerous for the government than the deal it had previouslycriticized, leading to suspicions that it had been improperly influenced by thecompany. When villagers, frustrated at their failure to secure effective legalredress, took up protests, company contractors and police retaliated againstthem for having dared to challenge the company.Several other Human Rights Watch reports touch on businessprivileges and the absence of remedies for victims or accountability:·A company that dumped toxic waste in Cambodiawas alleged to have bribed officials at every step in the process, subvertingthe oversight role that the government should have played.[100]·Because of inadequate government oversight,transnational labor agencies in several countries have in effect been givenprimary responsibility for informing workers about their rights and forresponding to cases of abuse, often leaving migrant domestic workers withalmost no opportunity for effective redress.[101]·Jurisdictional challenges and legal obstacleshave meant that few cases have gone forward against private contractors accusedof crimes in the Abu Ghraib detainee abuse cases and similar ones in Afghanistan.[102]·When contractors in Bosnia and Herzegovina wereimplicated in sex trafficking, the only punishment they endured was beingfired, the very same treatment that DynCorp gave the whistleblowers who exposedthe conduct. The contractors were not eligible for prosecution in Bosnia and Herzegovina because the companyrepatriated them to the UnitedStates almost immediately after they cameunder suspicion. A US lawpassed in 2000 gave the USgovernment jurisdiction over the contractor employees, but implementingregulations to allow such prosecutions were not adopted until 2006.[103]·In Guatemala, regulations governingthe actions of private security forces have not been enforced, allowing abusesto be carried out with impunity.[104]·In the Dominican Republic, where womenwere often tested for HIV as a condition of work in violation of national law,private employers continued the abuse with impunity.[105]FindingsSeveral themes emerge from the above examination ofsituations in which business activity undermines human rights.First, business impacts on human rights are not limited tosectors that have received the most attention to date-in particular apparelmanufacturing and the extractive industries-and existing initiatives areinsufficient to address the full scope of the problem. The case material abovedemonstrates that the activities of all types of businesses, large and small, domesticand multinational, public and private, can implicate human rights. To fullycombat business-related human rights abuse, a broader approach encompassing allbusiness actors and contexts is needed.Second, in assessing the impact of business activity onhuman rights, it is important to focus on company ties to third parties thatcommit abuse as well as cases in which businesses themselves directly causeharm. Such third parties are often government agents-such as security forces-workingin coordination with companies or on behalf of company interests. Other times thenegative human rights impact stems from business failure to take adequate stepsto prevent misconduct by employees, suppliers, or others with whom it hasbusiness relationships. This finding is significant because it demonstratesthat businesses' role in relation to human rights is not limited to obviouscases. It also makes clear that efforts to address corporate conduct must takeinto account that businesses can affect human rights through their associationwith others as well as on their own.Third, governments often fail to protect their own citizens,as well as non-citizens, from abuses by businesses. The relative power ofcompanies in relation to the governments of countries in which they operate,particularly in economicallydisadvantaged states, can contribute to this gap in protection, but itis also found in wealthy countries. This gap is exacerbated by closerelationships between business and government officials and by theunrepresentative nature of some governments whose officials have ties tobusinesses, though democratic governments are obviously not immune to undueinfluence by moneyed interests. The key lesson to be drawn here is that ifbusiness-related abuses are to be curbed, governments need to do a much betterjob of regulating business conduct. Further study of the motivations orcircumstances that underlie state inaction would help inform more effectiveresponses.Fourth, individuals whose rights are affected by businessesare often unable to attain satisfactory resolution of their claims or aredenied redress altogether. In some cases, individuals and communities who tryto enforce their rights through protests or through judicial means have beensubject to retaliation. The inability to obtain redress compounds the originalviolation and itself constitutes a violation of victims' rights. This findingreinforces the need to promote access to justice for victims ofbusiness-related abuses and the importance of further examination of thereasons states are not providing appropriate remedies and reparations.Finally, the examples presented here indicate that manycompanies have not yet ascribed to business standards addressing human rights ordisregard codes of conduct or company commitments to social responsibility, wherethey exist. Taken together with the rest of the analysis in this report, theclear conclusion is that existing efforts to address the impacts of businessactivities on human rights are insufficient.ConclusionCompanies create jobs and economic opportunities, and can bea positive force for human rights improvements when they engage in responsiblepractices. They also can act in a way that is neutral with regard to humanrights. Yet, too often, as the examples in this report illustrate, businessactors themselves engage in abusive behavior or contribute to human rightsviolations, often with lasting effects on individuals and communities the worldover.Globalization has led to widespread growth in commerce andthe reach of business, but human rights protections have lagged behind. Thereare no clear, common rules to prevent business-related human rights abuses andprovide adequate remedies and reparation when they occur.The scope of abuses points to the need to develop globalstandards that define a common benchmark for business conduct. Such standardswould not only motivate businesses to reform their practices, but also wouldhelp ensure that governments do more to prevent and punish business-relatedabuses. Ultimately, of course, what is needed is not merely better standards settingcommon rules for business conduct or more vigorous state enforcement of lawsand regulations, though both are essential, but concerted action by allrelevant actors to ensure that business activities do not impede the enjoymentof human rights.This report has sought to contribute to an improvedunderstanding of the impact of business activities on the rights of individualsand communities. Many colleague organizations, scholars, and other experts areworking toward the same end. Greater awareness of business-related abuses andthe harm suffered by the victims, it is hoped, will help spur action tomeaningfully address the problem.[106]Human Rights Watch and CHRGJ, along with othernon-governmental organizations and institutions, recognize the need for avariety of efforts on several fronts-including within companies, industries,and countries-to strengthen the protection of human rights in relation tobusiness activities. Yet unless these diverse efforts can be made moreconsistent and effective, unless they are fully aligned with human rightsprinciples, and unless they are far-reaching in their application, they willcontinue to fail to protect individuals and communities from harm. For thatreason, we believe that a UN declaration or other international instrument thatdefines a common benchmark for business conduct is essential. Clearlyarticulated and widely endorsed global standards would create a framework forconcerted action to ensure that business behavior around the world is humanrights compliant.[107]AcknowledgmentsThis reportis the outcome of a project by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice(CHRGJ) at New York University (NYU) Schoolof Law and Human RightsWatch.CHRGJaims to generate substantive, cutting-edge, and sophisticated contributions tohuman rights research and legal scholarship, and to actively engage in publicaffairs by making original and constructive contributions to ongoing policydebates relating to human rights. It achieves these aims by undertakingrigorous legal analysis and disseminating studies in several key research andproject areas, which include a focus on non-discrimination; economic, social,and cultural rights; and the accountability of non-state actors for humanrights abuses.

Moreover, there is a broad consensusthat businesses are subject to direct responsibility for human rights abusesthat amount to international crimes, including enslavement, genocide, war crimes,and crimes against humanity. For a discussion of the potential for businessentities to be held legally liable for grave violations of international law,see, for example, Anita Ramasastry and Robert C. Thompson, Commerce, Crime and Conflict: Legal Remedies for Private SectorLiability for Grave Breaches of International Law (Norway: Fafo, 2006),http://www.fafo.no/pub/rapp/536/536.pdf (accessed November 15, 2007). Onthe direct responsibilities of business in relation to the laws of war, see,for example, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), "Business andinternational humanitarian law: An introduction to the rights and obligationsof business enterprises under international humanitarian law," November 11, 2006,http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/business-ihl-150806 (accessedNovember 15, 2007).[4]For example, CEDAW, CRC, CMW, CPD, and the UN Declaration on the Rights ofPersons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minoritiesall address the enjoyment of rights by members of particular groups.[5]The United Nations Human Rights Committee has given the term "security ofperson" an independent meaning from "liberty and security" to reflects needs ofpersonal security, in addition to the detention issues with which it isfrequently associated and which are addressed elsewhere in this  report. The use of the term in this  report draws on language from Article 3 of UDHR("Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person") and Article5(b) of ICERD ("The right to security of person and protection by the Stateagainst violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted by government officials orby any individual group or institution").

In this report, wehave opted to address cultural rights explicitly in the section on the rightsof communities or groups. Cultural rights, like all rights, remain interdependentand interconnected. For example many economic and social rights such as the rightsto food, water and health have direct implications for the right to life andright to bodily and personal integrity.[23]See, for example, right toeducation at UDHR, art. 26(1), ICESCR, arts. 13(1), 13(2), and CRC, art. 28(1);right to health at UDHR, art. 25(1), and ICESCR, art. 12; right to housing atUDHR, art. 25(1), and ICESCR, art. 11(1); right to necessary social servicesand social security at UDHR, arts. 22, 25(1), ICESCR, art. 9, and CRC, art. 26(1);right to food at UDHR, art. 25(1), and ICESCR, art. 11(1); right to clothing atUDHR, art. 25(1), and ICESCR, art. 11(1); right to water, including sanitation,at UDHR, art. 25(1), and ICESCR, art. 11(1); and right to an adequate standardof living at UDHR, art. 25(1), and ICESCR, art. 11(1). These rights also arereflected in other core human rights instruments that specifically address themin relation to the elimination and prevention of discrimination.[24]Human Rights Watch, Razing Rafah: MassHome Demolitions in the Gaza Strip (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2004), http://hrw.org/reports/2004/rafah1004/,see, for example, pp. 2-3, 10-12, 94-101, 10-110, 113-115; see also, letterfrom Human Rights Watch to Caterpillar, Inc., October 29, 2004, http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/11/22/isrlpa9706.htm;"Israel: Caterpillar Should Suspend Bulldozer Sales," Human Rights Watch newsrelease, November 23, 2004, http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/11/22/isrlpa9711.htm.[25]Human Rights Watch, Women's Work:Discrimination Against Women in the Ukrainian Labor Force, vol. 15, no.5(D), August 2003, http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/ukraine0803/index.htm, pp.3-4, 8-10, 18-38.[26]Human Rights Watch, BuildingTowers, Cheating Workers: Exploitation of MigrantConstruction Workers in the UnitedArab Emirates, vol. 18, no. 8(E),November 2006, http://hrw.org/reports/2006/uae1106/index.htm, pp. 8-9, 21-24,40-45.[27]Human Rights Watch, Blood, Sweat, andFear, pp. 42, 54, 57, 65, 74.[28]Human Rights Watch, Help Wanted: Abusesagainst Female Migrant Domestic Workers in Indonesia and Malaysia, vol. 16,no. 9(C), July 2004, http://hrw.org/reports/2004/indonesia0704/, pp. 33, 78.[29]Human Rights Watch, Toxic Justice: HumanRights, Justice and Toxic Waste in Cambodia, vol. 11, no. 2(c), May 1999, http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/cambotox/,pp. 6-9, 10-11, 25-33.[30]Human Rights Watch, Underage and Unprotected,pp. 11, 16-18.

The groupings in this  report are intended simply to allow for asimplified presentation of various examples and, as emphasized above, shouldnot be read to suggest that the classifications are fixed or that human rightsare anything less than interdependent and interconnected.[70]The fundamental labor rights are identified in the ILO's Declaration onFundamental Principles and Rights at Work and are enshrined in eight core ILOconventions: ILO Convention No. 138 concerning the Minimum Age for Admission toEmployment, adopted June 26, 1973, 1015 U.N.T.S. 297, entered into force June19, 1976, and ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the Prohibition and ImmediateAction for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, adopted June 17,1999, 38 I.L.M. 1207, entered into force November 19, 2000; ILO Convention No.87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise,adopted July 9, 1948, 68 U.N.T.S. 17, entered into force July 4, 1950, and ILOConvention No. 98 concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right toOrganize and to Bargain Collectively, adopted July 1, 1949, 96 U.N.T.S. 257, enteredinto force July 18, 1951; ILO Convention No. 29 concerning Forced or CompulsoryLabor, adopted June 28, 1930, 39 U.N.T.S. 55, entered into force May 1, 1932,and ILO Convention No. 105 concerning the Abolition of Forced Labor, adoptedJune 25, 1957, 320 U.N.T.S. 291, entered into force January 17, 1959; and ILOConvention No. 100, and ILO Convention No. 111. These core labor rights arealso preserved in various international human rights instruments, including,for example: freedom of association and right to collective bargaining at UDHR,art. 23(4), ICESCR, art. 8(1), and ICCPR, art. 22; elimination of forced orcompulsory labor at UDHR, art. 4, and ICCPR, art. 8; elimination ofdiscrimination in remuneration at UDHR, art. 23(2), and ICESCR, art. 7;requirement of minimum working age for children at ICESCR, art. 10(3), and CRC,art. 32; and prohibition of employment of children in hazardous occupations at ICESCR,art. 10(3), and CRC, art. 32.[71]See,for example, right to work at UDHR, art. 23(1), ICESCR, art. 6(1), CEDAW, art.11(1a), and CPD, art. 27(1); right to free choice of employment at UDHR, art.23(1), and ICESCR, art. 6(1); right to just and favorable conditions of work atUDHR, art. 23(1), ICESCR, art. 7, CMW, art. 25, and CPD, art. 27(1b); right tojust and favorable remuneration at UDHR, art. 23(3), ICESCR, art. 7, and CMW,art. 25; and right to reasonable working hours, paid holidays, and rest andleisure at UDHR, art. 24, and ICESCR, art. 7.[72]See, for example, prohibition on discrimination against women on the grounds ofmarriage or maternity at CEDAW, art. 11(2); special protection for mothers andchildren at UDHR, art. 25(2), and ICESCR, art. 10(2); and special protection forchildren at ICESCR, art. 10(3), and CRC, arts. 32, 36.[73]Human Rights Watch, Tainted Harvest, pp. 2-3, 15-19, 20-22, 24-42, 44,80-94; Human Rights Watch, Underage and Unprotected, pp. 10-18; HumanRights Watch, Turning a Blind Eye, pp. 3-8, 11, 13-22, 25-27, 49-61;Human Rights Watch, Small Change, pp. 25-40, 53-56, 78-80; Human RightsWatch, Forgotten Schools, pp. 37-38.[74]See, for example, Human Rights Watch, Paying the Price, pp. 10-12,16-17; Human Rights Watch, Tainted Harvest, pp. 57-59, 65-72; HumanRights Watch, Corporations and Human Rights: Freedom of Association in aMaquila in Guatemala, vol. 9, no. 3(B), March 1997, http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/guatemla/guatemal973.pdf,pp. 37-61; Human Rights Watch, North Korea: Workers' Rights at the KaesongIndustrial Complex, no. 1, October 2006, http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/korea1006/,pp. 11-13; Human Rights Watch, UnfairAdvantage, pp. 91-243.[75]See, for example, Human Rights Watch, PetitionRegarding Ecuador's Eligibility for ATPA Designation, September 2005, http://hrw.org/backgrounder/business/ecuador0905/index.htm,pp. 11-13.[76]See, for example, Human Rights Watch, BadDreams, pp. 27-44, 47-53, 57-69, 75-88, 90-105, 108-118; Human RightsWatch, Unprotected Migrants: Zimbabweans in South Africa's Limpopo Province,vol. 18, no. 6(A), July 2006,http://hrw.org/reports/2006/southafrica0806/southafrica0806web.pdf, pp. 22-50; HumanRights Watch, Building Towers, Cheating Workers, pp. 26-47; Human RightsWatch, Blood, Sweat, and Fear, pp. 105-117.[77]Human Rights Watch, Bad Dreams, pp.2, 20-24, 45; Human Rights Watch, HelpWanted, pp. 79-80; Human Rights Watch, Maidto Order, pp. 34-37; Human Rights Watch, Building Towers, Cheating Workers, pp. 2, 8-11;.[78]Human Rights Watch, Forced Labor in BrazilRe-Visited: On-Site Investigations Document that Practice Continues, vol.5, no. 12, November 1993, pp. 3-7, 9-19; Human Rights Watch, The Curse ofGold, pp. 33-34, 48-50;Human Rights Watch, Small Change; HumanRights Watch, The Small Hands of Slavery.[79]Human Rights Watch, Hidden in theHome, pp. 21-22; Human Rights Watch, Memorandum of Concern: Traffickingof Migrant Women for Forced Prostitution in Greece, July 2001,http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/greece/greece_memo_all.pdf, pp. 10-13; HumanRights Watch, Bottom of the Ladder: Exploitation and Abuse of Girl DomesticWorkers in Guinea, vol. 19, no. 8(A), June 2007,http://hrw.org/reports/2007/guinea0607/guinea0607web.pdf, pp. 42-46; HumanRights Watch, Owed Justice: Thai Women Trafficked into Debt Bondage in Japan(New York: Human Rights Watch, 2000),http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/japan/, pp. 22-24, 25-27, 29-31, 32-46, 58-116;Women's Rights Project (now Human Rights Watch/Women's Rights) and Asia Watch(now Human Rights Watch/Asia), A Modern Form of Slavery: Trafficking ofBurmese Women and Girls into Brothels in Thailand (New York: Human RightsWatch, 1993), pp. 38-74; Human Rights Watch, Borderline Slavery: ChildTrafficking in Togo, vol. 15, no. 8(A), April 2003, http://hrw.org/reports/2003/togo0403/togo0403.pdf,pp. 8-35; Human Rights Watch, Hidden in the Home, pp. 21-22.[80]Human Rights Watch, Help Wanted, see,for example, pp. 4, 27, 28, 35, 80.[81]Human Rights Watch, Turning a Blind Eye, pp. 16-25; Human Rights Watch, BuildingTowers, Cheating Workers, pp. 40-45; Human Rights Watch, The Curse ofGold, pp. 54-55; Human Rights Watch, Blood, Sweat, and Fear, pp.29-47; Human Rights Watch, Small Change, pp. 27-28.

Res. 61/295, U.N. Doc. A/RES/47/1 (2007)), a workingdefinition would include cultural groups (and their descendants) who have anhistorical continuity or association with a given region, or parts of a region,and who formerly or currently inhabit the region and who have maintained atleast in part their distinct linguistic, cultural, and social/organizationalcharacteristics, and in doing so remain differentiated in some degree from thesurrounding populations and dominant culture of the state.[89]For example, the Human Rights Committee interprets article 27 of the ICCPR toprotect "traditional land tenure" of indigenous peoples "as an aspect of theenjoyment of culture;" ILO Convention No. 169 protects rights of ownership andpossession of indigenous peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy;and cultural identity is addressed in ILO Convention No. 169 ("[p]romoting thefull realization of the social, economic and cultural rights of these peopleswith respect for their social and cultural identity, their customs andtraditions and their institutions"). See ILO Convention No. 169 concerningIndigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, adopted June 27, 1989,28 ILM 1382, entered into force September 5, 1991, art. 2(2b).[90]See, for example, indigenous land rights in ILO Convention No. 169 and the UNDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; rights to practice culture andreligion, and to participate in the cultural life of the community at UDHR,art. 27(1), ICESCR, art. 15, ICCPR, art. 27, CRC, arts. 30, 31, CMW, art. 31(1),and in ILO Convention No. 169; and right to participate in the cultural life ofthe community at UDHR, art. 27(1), ICESCR, art. 15(1a), and CRC, art. 31(2).See also the UN Declaration on the Rights of all Persons Belonging to Nationalor Ethnic, Religious or Linguistic Minorities.[91]Human Rights Watch, Without Remedy, pp.3-5, 9-10, 13-14, 18-21, 33-39, 44, 53-58;Human Rights Watch, Too High A Price: TheHuman Rights Cost of the Indonesian Military's Economic Activities, vol.18, no. 5(C), June 2006, http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/indonesia0606/,pp. 13, 38-44.[92]Human Rights Watch, Out of Limbo?Addressing the Plight of Kosovo Roma Refugees in Macedonia, December 10, 2003, http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/macedonia1203/index.htm,pp. 15, 21-22.[93]Human Rights Watch, "No One Has the Libertyto Refuse": Tibetan Herders Forcibly Relocated in Gansu,Qinghai, Sichuan,and the TibetAutonomous Region, vol. 19, no. 8(C), June 2007,http://hrw.org/reports/2007/tibet0607/tibet0607web.pdf, pp. 3-4, 26-38, 46-48.[94]See, for example, Human Rights Watch, Indivisible Human Rights: TheRelationship of Political and Civil Rights to Survival, Subsistence, andPoverty (New York: Human Rights Watch, 1992), see especially, "LandAlienation for Logging and Commercial Agriculture," pp. 37-39.[95]Human Rights Watch, Undue Process: Terrorism Trials, Military Courts, andthe Mapuche in Southern Chile, vol. 16,no. 5(B), October 2004, http://hrw.org/reports/2004/chile1004/chile1004.pdf, seeespecially, pp. 1-3, 7, 14-16, 25-26, 50-51; "Chile: Mapuche Acquitted ofTerrorism Charges," Human Rights Watch news release, November 4, 2004, http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/11/04/chile9608.htm;Human Rights Watch, "Chile," in WorldReport 2007 (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2007), http://www.hrw.org/wr2k7/wr2007master.pdf,pp. 190-194.[96]Human Rights Watch and the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Defending the Earth: Abuses of Human Rights andthe Environment (New York: Human Rights Watch and NRDC, 1992), pp. 49-70.[97]See, for example, right to a fair legal process at UDHR, arts. 10, 11, ICCPR,arts. 9, 14, CRC, arts. 12(2), 40, and CMW, art. 18(2-7); right to equalitybefore the law at UDHR, art. 7, and ICCPR, art. 26; right to seek reparationand satisfaction at ICERD, art. 6; and right to an effective remedy at UDHR,art. 8, ICERD, art. 6, ICCPR, art. 2, CAT, arts. 13, 14.[98]Human Rights Watch, A Job or Your Rights,pp. 3, 5, 23-26, 50.[99]Human Rights Watch, The Enron Corporation,see especially, pp. 1-3, 23-24, 29-45, 54-61, 80-82, 99-104.[100]Human Rights Watch, Toxic Justice, pp. 2, 3, 9, 37, 34.[101]See, for example, Human Rights Watch, HelpWanted, pp. 3, 21-22, 52, 84.[102]Human Rights Watch, By the Numbers,pp. 6, 19-20; "Q&A: Private Military Contractors and the Law," Human RightsWatch questions and answers; "US: Close Legal Loopholes Allowing Contractors toAct with Impunity," Human Rights Watch news release, October 2, 2007, http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/02/usint17002.htm.[103]Human Rights Watch, "Bosniaand Herzegovina," in World Report 2003,p. 324.[104]Human Rights Watch, Guatemala's Forgotten Children, p. 47.[105]Human Rights Watch, A Test of Inequality, pp. 1, 17-23.[106]In mid-2008, the United Nations special representative on business and humanrights, John Ruggie, is anticipated to issue his final report andrecommendations to the Human Rights Council in Geneva.
