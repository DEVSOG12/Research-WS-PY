According to a United Nations expert, the United States ranked 36th in the world in terms of access to water and sanitation in 2017. That same year, nearly 77 million US residents were estimated to be served by drinking water systems with one or more violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Little has changed since then. Black, brown, and low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by both urban and rural water vulnerabilities.The human right to water is derived from the right an adequate standard of living. However, the US government, as well as state and local authorities, have refused to acknowledge this basic right. In 2014, a US federal judge in Michigan stated there was “no enforceable right” to water after the city of Detroit started massive shut-offs of household water supplies if people did not pay their water bills.Members of the Water Equity and Climate Resilience Caucus, featured in the video, are asking for support of two provisions in the draft Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act that would target grants to address the disproportionate impacts of Covid-19 in communities already impacted by environmental degradation, subsidize water costs for low-income households, and restore or keep clean water access for communities facing shut-offs or toxic water.People in the US can contact their senator and join in the effort to #KeepWaterOn for communities across the country.Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Racial DiscriminationTopicHealth Environment and HealthMore ReadingJune 11, 2020DispatchesUS Study Suggests Hurricanes May Trigger Early BirthsJune 10, 2020News ReleaseUS: Covid-19 Disparities Reflect Structural Racism, AbusesReportsApril 12, 2022Report“If I’m Out of Insulin, I’m Going to Die”United States’ Lack of Regulation Fuels Crisis of Unaffordable InsulinJanuary 20, 2022Report“We Need Access”Ending Preventable Deaths from Cervical Cancer in Rural GeorgiaMore ReadingJune 11, 2020DispatchesUS Study Suggests Hurricanes May Trigger Early BirthsJune 10, 2020News ReleaseUS: Covid-19 Disparities Reflect Structural Racism, AbusesMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
