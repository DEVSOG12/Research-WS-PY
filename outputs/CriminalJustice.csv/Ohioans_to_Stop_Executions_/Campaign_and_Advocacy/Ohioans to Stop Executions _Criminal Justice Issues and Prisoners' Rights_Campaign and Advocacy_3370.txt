Read this!On Monday, OTSE’s executive director Kevin Werner and I met with the Governor’s Counsel who is preparing clemency materials for Governor Kasich regarding the execution scheduled for January 12, 2017. It’s going to take a lot of effort to get the Governor’s attention, but that is what we are doing – together! Here’s how:In the mail: 23 packets of 10 postcards in each. 21 packets with 25 cards. Eight packets with 50 cards, six with 100 in each, and five with 250 postcards. How many can we send to you?Yesterday Emily and I mailed nearly 70 packets containing more than 3300 “No Need to Execute” postcards to all corners of Ohio. Individuals, civic groups and faith communities have agreed to purchase stamps locally and mail the postcards individually, as they are signed. Our goal is to create a steady flow of these postcards into Governor Kasich’s office from now until the week of the scheduled execution.It’s not too late. Click here to order your cards and to take additional action.#1 – Click here to e-mail Governor Kasich.
