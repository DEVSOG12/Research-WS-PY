This is down from 26 cases in 2015, and 29 cases in 2014.”Ohio saw a slight rise in new death sentences (4), however two of those cases carried over from indictments in previous years.With the state seeking to resume executions in January after a three-year hiatus, Ohioans to Stop Executions highlights declining use of and support for executions in our state and across the nation. Millions of Ohioans prefer alternatives to the death penalty and call on Governor Kasich to not allow executions by granting clemency to all those with pending execution dates during the remainder of his term in office.Former Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro, who had a role in 18 executions during his term in office, is quoted in the new report from an op-ed published recently in the Columbus Dispatch. “I am convinced that the death penalty is just not worth it any more, and I don’t think it can be fixed,” wrote Petro, who joined the board of directors of Ohioans to Stop Executions in September. “If we’re going to have the death penalty, then it must not be carried out until the legislature implements the task force’s reforms intended to ensure fairness and accuracy.”Ohio Numbers for 2016:New Death Sentences: 4James Tench (Medina) Sentenced 2016, Indicted 2016Michael Madison (Cuyahoga) Sentenced 2016, Indicted 2013Glen Bates (Hamilton) Sentenced 2016, Indicted 2015Damantae Graham (Portage) Sentenced 2016, Indicted 2016Trends: 2016 (4)2015 (1)2014 (3)2013 (4)2012 (3)2011 (2)First death sentence from Portage County since 2005Second death sentence in Medina County since 1981 (he other was in 2013)Only death sentence out of Cuyahoga County under prosecutor Tim McGintyFirst death sentence from Hamilton County since 2010. 27th Defendant sentenced to death under Joe DetersNew Capital indictments: 10Trends: 2016 (10)2015 (26)2014 (29)2013 (21)2012 (36)2011 (53)SENT BY:Abraham J.
