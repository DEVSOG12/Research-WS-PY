The letter was attached to petitions signed by 111,788 concerned individuals supporting appointment of a special prosecutor.Click to expand Image©2010 John Moore/GettyImagesThe Senate Intelligence Committee released its summary report on the CIA’s program on December 9, 2014, but six months later, the Obama administration has taken no steps to criminally investigate the committee’s findings.“The Justice Department has a clear responsibility to carry out a credible and comprehensive criminal investigation into the overwhelming evidence that US officials used torture in violation of US law,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “The Obama administration’s continued failure to act in the face of this mountain of evidence risks sending the message that torture is a valid policy option rather than the crime that it is.”“The Justice Department – and the Obama administration – are effectively burying the Senate torture report,” said Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA. “The Senate report contains disturbing and previously unknown details about torture, and yet the Justice Department is keeping it unread and unopened. It is effectively handing out a ‘get out of jail free’ card to all those responsible for torture. The message to every would-be torturer is that they will get away with it because the Justice Department will turn a blind eye.”“If our laws have meaning, we can’t accept that some of our country’s most senior officials authorized criminal conduct and were never held accountable. Torture is a crime,” said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “We know it happened. The Senate torture report documented it in excruciating detail. It’s up to Attorney General Lynch to uphold the laws of our land and ensure that a criminal investigation of the U.S. torture program is conducted.”Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryUnited States Criminal Justice National SecurityTopicTerrorism / Counterterrorism CIA Activities TortureMore ReadingJune 23, 2015LetterHuman Rights Watch, ACLU, Amnesty Call For Special Prosecutor for TortureDecember 22, 2014News ReleaseUS: Investigate, Prosecute CIA TortureReportsFebruary 5, 2020ReportDeported to DangerUnited States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and AbuseOctober 31, 2019Report“They’ve Shot Many Like This”Abusive Night Raids by CIA-Backed Afghan Strike ForcesMore ReadingJune 23, 2015LetterHuman Rights Watch, ACLU, Amnesty Call For Special Prosecutor for TortureDecember 22, 2014News ReleaseUS: Investigate, Prosecute CIA TortureMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
