We work on a wide range of human rights issues worldwide, including the risk of refoulement of refugees, use of torture and restrictions on basic rights, like freedom of movement to leave one’s home country.Related ContentLetter from Human Rights Watch to President Xi Jinping re: North Korea RefugeesWe write to request that you urgently stop the forced return of a group of nine North Korean refugees currently in China’s custody, and allow them to travel and seek asylum in a safe third country. We are deeply concerned about the group, which includes an 11-month-old baby. If returned to North Korea, they will face harsh abuses, including incarceration in prison camps, forced labor, torture, and a high risk of execution or sexual violence. Additional information about this group is available here: https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/21/china-dont-return-nine-north-korean-refugees.This matter is quite urgent because according to the latest information provided by family members, this group was last being held at Tumen, in Jilin province, at a military garrison near the China-North Korea border. A forced return could happen at any time.Because North Koreans who leave the country without permission face certain harsh punishment upon repatriation, they should be considered as refugees sur place – people who become refugees as a result of fleeing their country or due to circumstances arising after their flight.As I am sure you know, North Korea’s Ministry of People’s Security adopted a decree in 2010 making defection a crime of “treachery against the nation,” punishable by death. North Koreans who have fled the country since 2013, or who are residing outside the country but are able to surreptitiously communicate with contacts inside North Korea, have told Human Rights Watch that people who are caught and repatriated from China face incarceration and mistreatment in political prison camps (kwanliso), which are operated by the State Security Ministry.Despite this well-documented reality, China continues to label all North Koreans in China as illegal “economic migrants” and routinely repatriates them. However, as a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, China is prohibited from returning refugees – people who have left their countries and have a well-founded fear of persecution – to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened. The Convention Against Torture, to which China is party, states that no government “shall expel, return (refouler) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”On November 17, 2015, the United Nations Committee Against Torture raised concerns with China about returning North Koreans to North Korea; Chinese officials failed to provide a credible reply.We strongly urge the Chinese government to reveal the whereabouts of the group, abide by your international obligations to protect refugees, and under no circumstances force them back to a place where they could face persecution.  Doing so will damage China’s international reputation, and deepen concerns about its willingness to abide by established international law.  The only reasonable, rights-respecting way for Beijing to proceed is to allow this group of nine North Koreans to move without hindrance or harassment to a country where they will feel safe.Sincerely,Sophie RichardsonChina Director, Asia DivisionHuman Rights WatchCC:Guo ShengkunMinister of Public SecurityNo. 14, Donchang’anjie,Dongchengqu, Beijing, 100741People’s Republic of ChinaTel: +86 10 6626 2114Email: gabzfwz@mps.gov.cnWang YiForeign MinisterMinistry of Foreign AffairsNo. 2, Chaoyangmen Nandajie,Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100701People’s Republic of ChinaTel: +86 10 6596 1114Fax: +86 10 6559 1516Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAsia China and Tibet North Korea South KoreaMore ReadingOctober 24, 2022CommentaryThe Nepal Government Should Expand Child GrantsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseMalaysia: Surge in Summary Deportations to MyanmarReportsAugust 10, 2022Report“I Don’t Want to Change Myself”Anti-LGBT Conversion Practices, Discrimination, and Violence in MalaysiaApril 14, 2022Report“I Could Have Been Next”Stymied Reforms in the MaldivesMore ReadingOctober 24, 2022CommentaryThe Nepal Government Should Expand Child GrantsOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseMalaysia: Surge in Summary Deportations to MyanmarMost ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
