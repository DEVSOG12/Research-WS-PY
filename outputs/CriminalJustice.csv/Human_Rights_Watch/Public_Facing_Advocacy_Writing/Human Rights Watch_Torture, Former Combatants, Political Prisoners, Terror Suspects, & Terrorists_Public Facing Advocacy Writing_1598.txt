We urge you to intervene on his behalf to prevent a gross abuse of his rights.According to the information we have received, Abubakar Aliyu was found guilty of stealing 32,000 naira and sentenced to the amputation of his hand. Two accomplices, both sixteen years of age, received sentences of fifty lashes with a cane and eighteen months in jail.Amputation is an extreme form of corporal punishment, which is expressly prohibited by article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Similarly, rule 17.3 of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice provides that "juveniles shall not be subject to corporal punishment." More generally, article 19 of the convention guarantees the right of children to be free from all forms of physical or mental violence; relying particularly on this provision, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has found that any corporal punishment is incompatible with the convention (see Report on the Seventh Session, Committee on the Rights of the Child, U.N. Doc. CRC/C/34, Annex IV, September-October 1994, p. 63).In fact, amputation and other forms of corporal punishment are impermissible under international law whether they are imposed on children or on adults. As the Special Rapporteur on Torture has observed, "corporal punishment is inconsistent with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment enshrined, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment" (see Report of the Special Rapporteur, Commission on Human Rights, 53d sess., Item 8(a), U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/1997/7 (1997)).The international legal obligation to protect all persons from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment applies in all circumstances; a state may not invoke provisions of its domestic law to justify noncompliance with international law. In particular, the Special Rapporteur advises that "those States applying religious law are bound to do so in such a way as to avoid the application of pain-inducing acts or corporal punishment in practice.The imposition of a sentence of amputation on a fifteen-year-old is a particularly egregious violation of international law. We urge you to ensure that this inhumane sentence is not carried out.Sincerely,Michael BochenekCounsel, Children's Rights DivisionYour tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.$50$100$250$500$1000Other$Donate NowRegion / CountryAfrica NigeriaTopicChildren's Rights Torture Juvenile JusticeMore ReadingSeptember 21, 2004Report“Political Shari’a”?ReportsMarch 22, 2022Report“I Only Need Justice”Unlawful Detention and Abuse in Unauthorized Places of Detention in UgandaDecember 16, 2021Report“They Are Destroying Our Future”Armed Separatist Attacks on Students, Teachers, and Schools in Cameroon’s Anglophone RegionsMore ReadingSeptember 21, 2004Report“Political Shari’a”?Most ViewedOctober 24, 2022News ReleaseQatar: Security Forces Arrest, Abuse LGBT PeopleNovember 12, 2018News ReleasePakistan: Girls Deprived of EducationFebruary 7, 2013ReportBreaking the SilenceOctober 24, 2022ReportTurkey: Hundreds of Refugees Deported to SyriaNovember 1, 2018Report“You Cry at Night but Don’t Know Why”Share this via FacebookShare this via TwitterShare this via WhatsAppShare this via EmailOther ways to shareShare this via LinkedInShare this via RedditShare this via TelegramShare this via PrinterProtecting Rights, Saving LivesHuman Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justiceDonate NowGet updates on human rights issues from around the globe.
