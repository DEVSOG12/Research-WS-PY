120 years. At Heartland Alliance for Human Needs & Human Rights, the most important thing we’ve learned is that to have a lasting, critical impact,  you always have to be moving forward.
More than 600,000 people annually are supported 
by Heartland Alliance in their journey from crisis to stability and on to success. Our more than 1,000 employees and 900 volunteers work in a broad pantheon of programs, from helping a family moving out of public housing for the first time to helping survivors of torture to heal.
We’re a large organization, grounded in a compre-
hensive and respectful philosophy of care to help the most vulnerable among us lead better lives. But we are also a dynamic organization. Heartland Alliance envisions—and then operates—innovative programs and is prepared to quickly respond to both need and opportunity.
For example, when Haiti was devastated by a 
massive earthquake this year, we had experienced staff and volunteers on the ground within days, helping with medical care and treating survivors  of trauma. You can read more about the impact one of our nurses had in Haiti on page 17—and how the experience has helped Heartland Alliance improve its services back in Uptown. 
Throughout these pages, we highlight some of our 
biggest achievements over the last year, examples of the vision for change at Heartland Alliance: A new supportive housing development that reduces homelessness. A statewide expansion of our pioneering jobs program for the hardest to employ.  A mental health care program at the leading edge  of how community health care can operate.2010 is a good time to be prepared for complicated, interrelated issues. The economy is still wreaking havoc on low-income families. Foreclosures stand at record levels. The rules are changing for everything from health care to unemployment. The impact  of war, poverty, and natural disasters continues  to be felt around the world. We’re all being asked  to do more with less, to be more efficient and  more effective.

family rise out of  
extreme poverty  
during the  
worst economy  
in decades?2010 year in review     3This spring and summer, more than 25,000 
unemployed, low-income workers across Illinois were hired through the Put Illinois to Work program. In just four months, Heartland Alliance built what became the largest subsidized work program in the history of the state. 
Tiffany Williams hadn’t been able to find a job since 
2004. A single mother, she and her children were living “doubled up” with her sister’s family in an apartment in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood when 2010 began. Today she is working as an assistant cook at The Slab, a barbeque restaurant  on 79th Street in Chatham.
“I love it here. It’s like a family, and I like that between 
the catering and the cooking, there’s something new to do every day,” Williams says. “It feels great knowing I make my own money and can pay our bills.”
Like all Put Illinois to Work employees—all of whom 
were unemployed or underemployed and living below twice the federal poverty level before entering the program—Williams’ pay comes through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The program was first conceived in early March, when the Illinois Department of Human Services contacted Heartland Alliance with a request for us to quickly create and operate a jobs program.
“We’re the leading provider of Transitional Jobs in 
Illinois, and have a reputation in the field for being able to get things done,” says Matt Weis, the director of workforce development for Heartland Human Care Services. “This really tied in to what we’re good at and what we believe in—that work experience helps people get jobs.”
Williams was also given an extra boost because, like 
many of those we work with, she was involved with other Heartland Alliance programs to help families stabilize and succeed, including one program for Chicago Public School students and their families who don’t have enough money for their own apartment. Her family now lives in an apartment through the program, and she has taken courses on how to use a budget and how to approach parenting. With the new job, she says, everything is better  than before.
“It’s given me a chance to be responsible and to be 
a great mom,” she says. “Heartland Alliance has changed my life.”

homelessness be 
prevented, keeping the 
most vulnerable members 
of our community 
successfully  
housed?2010 year in review     7Four months after Mark Pringle moved into 
Hollywood House, he still can’t believe how his  bad luck turned to good fortune. 
For 14 years, Pringle lived in the same apartment  
in the Rogers Park neighborhood. 
After being hospitalized for two months, however, 
he returned home to find his things boxed up in the basement—he had been evicted. Living on a small Social Security check, with no money for a security deposit, he moved to a transient hotel near Wrigley Field. A month later, a friend who was storing Pringle’s possessions stopped by with more bad news: a fire had destroyed it all.
“I said to myself, ‘I don’t have anything. I’m going to 
run out of money. I’ll just be sleeping in the streets,” the 62-year-old Pringle says. “I was asking God if He could just let me die. I said, ‘I can’t live like this.’”
Then Pringle heard about Hollywood 
House, an apartment building in the Edgewater neighborhood that provides affordable housing for seniors. Pringle moved into Hollywood House at the end of a massive, nearly two-year renovation that put all new appliances, paint, and carpet in every one of the 197 units and installed heating and cooling upgrades, energy-efficient lighting, and more.
Hollywood House is part of 
Heartland Alliance’s plan to provide more services to seniors. “We understand the needs that come with an elderly population, especially at-risk seniors,” says Michael Goldberg, executive director of Heartland Housing. 
At Hollywood House, Heartland 
Alliance takes the lead on planning events for residents and helping coordinate services for those who need them, from help with shopping to connecting residents to in-home medical care.Pringle moved in last April, and he says everything has been improving ever since. He’s gotten furniture, clothing, and pots and pans from the staff at the front desk and from a local church where he’s become a regular. While he was fearful of leaving his room at the transient hotel, he now goes out daily and spends time on the terrace, talking with other tenants. “I leave my door open here. I never could do that before,” he says.
“It’s like I’m not afraid here,” Pringle says with tears 
in his eyes. “I never would have thought I could have a place like this. I worked three jobs at times in my life, but I never had enough money where I could afford a place where I could see the lake. It’s been  so wonderful.”

For the more than 48,000 homeless individuals in Illinois, a state identification card is needed to 
access both emergency and basic services such as federal and state aid, job training and education programs, substance use treatment, and other medical services. But the $20 fee for an ID card—which can often be lost or stolen while navigating life on the street or in a shelter—can be a powerful obstacle.

sts.510    cOn vergencewhat does it take  
for someone who is 
homeless and dealing 
with mental illness and/or 
substance use to  
really turn their  
life around?2010 year in review     11At 40 years old, Scott Olsezweski was living in a 
nursing home. Suffering from schizophrenia, he  has also battled substance use and he says he’s  been homeless many times. For three years in the nursing home, he spent his days trying to help others by attending to the needs of half a dozen elderly residents.
That changed a year ago, when Scott moved into his 
own apartment in Rogers Park. Through Heartland Alliance’s Money Follows the Person program, he’s one of nearly 100 formerly institutionalized nursing home patients who have a severe mental illness and now live on their own. Scott exercises every day, watches what he eats, and spends part of his days  at a local coffee shop, talking politics and life  with friends.
“I’ve had tough times in my life—bad days, bad 
weeks, and even bad years. Now I’m doing very, very well. I try not to take anything for granted, even just being able to walk to the store or do the dishes,”  he says.
Participants in the program are given a subsidy 
to help pay rent and household expenses, and Heartland Alliance connects each person with a community mental health center that provides services like counseling and medicine management. Even with all this, because of the high cost of nursing home care, the program saves the government more than $40,000 a year per participant.
Money Follows the Person is a federal program 
running in 29 states to help nursing home residents live on their own; the Illinois Department of Human Services’ Division of Mental Health hired Heartland Alliance to create and operate a pilot program to specifically focus on residents with mental illness. Three Heartland Alliance teams work throughout Chicago, spending time with potential participants  to see if the program is appropriate. “It’s such a  good fit with our mission of human rights,” says Stephen Edfors, manager of clinical operations at Heartland Alliance. 
“A lot of these folks don’t belong in a nursing home, 
but they just don’t have the financial support to get out,” Edfords says. “On the day of transition, they’re so excited and thrilled. When we check in with them after they’ve moved, there are a lot of hugs.”
“I don’t look at it as a place I’ve arrived at. I see it as 
a starting point,” Scott says carefully of his new life. “I have disabilities in certain areas, and I’ve learned to compensate in those areas. I feel like I’ve found a sanctuary where I can really think about what I want to do.”

80 miles from Port-au-Prince, along the border  with the Dominican Republic. In the center of town is the restaurant Chez Emie, where Nadia Fleurimé works as both a cook and a server. If you ask her about her daughter Narlie, she will smile, and ask you if you’d like to meet her—she’s playing in the yard at the side of the restaurant. They are together, and in the aftermath of the January 12 earthquake, this scene would have been hard to imagine.
Nadia was living in Port-au-Prince and running a 
quick errand when the earthquake struck. She rushed home to find Narlie seriously injured. Part of the house had fallen on her as she lay in bed. Family members were able to pull Narlie from the rubble, and she was taken to a hotel being used as an overflow hospital. After a few days she was taken  to Haiti’s General Hospital. Nadia was with her daughter day and night.
Doctors soon realized they were ill-equipped to 
deal with the severity of Narlie’s wounds, which included a badly injured leg and a severe head injury that caused so much swelling only one of her eyes opened. Doctors told Nadia that Narlie would be transferred to the USSNS Comfort, an American ship docked off the coast of Haiti and operating as a hospital for the most severely injured, but that she wouldn’t be able to accompany her daughter. 
Narlie was discharged from the Comfort three 
weeks later and placed in another hospital, where she continued to receive treatment—but her family believed she was still on the ship. The hospital had no information on Narlie’s family, so the center director called Heartland Alliance.
Heartland Alliance led the UNICEF-funded Family 
Tracing and Reunification Project, which worked to identify thousands of children separated from their families after the earthquake.
Our child protection officers were able to get several 
key pieces of information from Narlie about her life: the name of her school and her teacher, the church her family attended. With this information, Heartland Alliance child protection officers were able to track down Nadia, who had left the capital to live with her cousin in Belladère, a town undamaged by the earthquake. Nadia was overjoyed to finally learn news of her daughter. 
Narlie and Nadia 
were finally reunited on April 9, nearly three months after the earthquake. They received a reunification kit from Heartland Alliance with clothing and household items, and they returned to Belladère.
Narlie lost part of her 
right ear. She will need plastic surgery in the future, and she continues to walk with a pronounced limp. But she is alive today and has been reunited with her mother. For Narlie, as for many in Haiti, there is a long road to recovery ahead. Thanks to Heartland Alliance and our local partners, many children will face this road with their parents at their side.

Shortly after the January 12 earthquake, 
Craig Wilking got an email asking for medical volunteers to go to Haiti with Heartland Alliance. About 10 days later, Craig, a registered nurse  who has worked in Heartland Health Center – Uptown since 2001, arrived in Port-au-Prince.  He stayed for five weeks, organizing wave after wave of medical volunteers who came to the country for a week or two at a time to provide emergency care.
The numbers were overwhelming, with lines of 
sick and injured people stretched out for blocks every day. But in addition to the injured, many people came to the stadium to receive basic medical care, some for the first time in their lives. Craig says he saw similarities to his work with low-income and homeless patients in Chicago. 
“There was an enormity of need combined with  
a limitation of resources,” he says. 
Just as in Chicago, emergency care began to 
give way to long-term care. In Uptown, it means helping people who come in for a medical crisis manage their chronic conditions like asthma or diabetes. In Haiti, it meant treating malnutrition in babies whose mothers could no longer nurse as food in the camps became scarce. 
Craig used his Heartland-honed skills regularly 
in Port-au-Prince: flexibility, priority setting, quick decision-making under ever-changing circumstances, and a little bit of crowd control. What he brought back from Haiti was even more valuable. 
“Any time people are in crisis, it helps you remain 
sensitive. This experience broke me open a little more,” he says. “The goodness of our fellow humans really comes out. It’s amazing what  we will do for each other.”

Heartland Alliance is efficient: More than 90 cents 
of every dollar donated is applied directly to our programs. To fulfill our purpose—to impact the lives of the most vulnerable among us—we pay special attention to not just what we do, but how we do it.
The programs operated by Heartland Alliance 
all benefit from the strength of our core systems and from the economies of scale that come from our wide reach. Our annual strategic plan, for example, has specific goals for every program and integrates our work top-to-bottom. And at the end of every year, our board of directors reviews a comprehensive “report card” on our collective performance toward these goals.
Due to our diverse funding sources, our work is 
routinely independently audited, requiring quality management and reporting systems that allow us to measure how we perform against program goals and the impact of our work. When the outcomes aren’t up to our standards, we’re nimble enough  to make improvements.
We know that what makes Heartland Alliance 
special is our people. The more than 1,000 Heartland Alliance staff members are professionals and experts, from lawyers to housing developers, addiction specialists to policy analysts. All new hires are provided an in-depth orientation to Heartland Alliance’s core values, human rights framework, and programmatic breadth, and through our “Heartland University” we provide courses on dozens of topics for the continuing education of our staff.
What does it take to be a leader in human rights?  
For Heartland Alliance, the answer is proven programs run by well trained, professional staff in a system that sets ambitious goals and carefully measures results. Our smart “back office” on the ground allows our programs to soar.
