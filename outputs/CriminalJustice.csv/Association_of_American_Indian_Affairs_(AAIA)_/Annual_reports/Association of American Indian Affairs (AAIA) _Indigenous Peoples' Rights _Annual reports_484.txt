A MESSAGE  FROM  THE PRESIDENT  
  
DEAR FRIENDS : 
 
I am proud to present the 2011 Annual Report.  One of our major accomplishments during the 
last year was the re -designation and expansion of the Medicine Wheel/Medicine Mountain  
National Historic Landmark based upon its traditional cultural importance.  This designation 
will ensure that this place that is sacred to so many tribes will be protected permanently.  This 
designation is the culmination of a 20 year struggle.  It is an example of who AAIA is and what 
we do.  We tackle important issues and projects and stick with them for as long as it takes to 
succeed.  We have a long history in this regard.  
 
I am an Athabascan from Alaska and first became involved with AAIA in January 1962.  The 
State of Alaska had recently been established and was trying to claim title to our traditional 
lands and interfering with our ability to feed our families through subsistence activities like 
hunting and fishing.  With the assistance of AAIA, I pulled together a meeting of the Tanana 
Chiefs to fight this assault on our lands and people.  AAIA stood side -by-side with Alaska  
Natives for the next nine years until we achieved a settlement in 1971 providing us with title to 
44 million acres of land and $963 million in compensation.   
 
This is just one example of the incredible impact that AAIA has had over the years through its 
persistent efforts.  In the 1970s, AAIA’s documentation of the widespread and wrongful  
removal of Native children from their families and communities by state child welfare systems 
and our strong advocacy led to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978.   Ten years later, we gave 
voice to traditional Native people who were calling for the return of human remains and cul-
tural items that had been dug up by museums and collectors, stolen, or otherwise obtained 
through questionable means.  Our advocacy played a key role in the enactment of the Native 
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.  
 
1990 was also the year that we first testified before Congress about the failure of Congress to 
include tribes in child welfare programs providing billions of dollars in funding to states, a fail-
ure that made it much more difficult for tribes to effectively serve their families and children.  
Congress did not respond immediately, but we did not give up and, working with tribes and 
other national organizations, we continued our advocacy on this issue for almost 20 years.

A MESSAGE  FROM  THE PRESIDENT  (continued)  
  
Finally, in 2008, Congress passed the Fostering Connections to Success legislation and made 
tribes directly eligible for funding under the Title IV -E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance 
program.  
 
This is our history, but there are many more struggles in our future.  There are outstanding  
issues involving basic justice for Native people -- issues such as juvenile justice reform, inter-
national repatriation, and fixing the broken federal acknowledgment system -- that we will con-
tinue to work on in 2012 and beyond.  But we will not have the resources that we need to suc-
ceed without the continued generosity of our donors.  We thank you for your past support and 
ask for your future support as we continue to fight for Native American children, families and 
communities.   
 
Ana Basee (Thank You)  
 
Sincerely,

Athabascan

SUSTAIN  AND PERPETUATE  CULTURES  AND LANGUAGES  
SACRED  LANDS /TRADITIONAL  CULTURAL  PROPERTIES   
 For more than 20 years, AAIA has worked to protect the sacred Bighorn Medicine Wheel and 
Medicine Mountain in Wyoming.  Medicine Wheel and Medicine Mountain have been sacred 
to Plains Indians for centuries and in recent years tribes from around the country have gone 
there to pray and hold ceremonies.  Over the years, AAIA has assisted the tribes (led by the 
Medicine Wheel Coalition) to negotiate a variety of agreements to protect the site, most nota-
bly a Historic Preservation Plan (HPP), and AAIA represented the Coalition in court when 
the HPP was challenged by a logging company.  
 
In 2011, after years of work by AAIA, the Medicine Wheel Coalition and all of the consult-
ing parties to the HPP, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar approved an expanded Medicine 
Wheel/Medicine Mountain National Historic Landmark (approximately 4,000 acres) based 
upon the traditional cultural value of the site to the tribes.  This is the final piece of legal pro-
tection for this site and ensures that the Forest Service will always prioritize 
managing the land to protect the integrity of Medicine Wheel and Medicine 
Mountain as a traditional cultural property.  
 
Another sacred place that AAIA has worked to protect for the last six years is 
the San Francisco Peaks in Arizona, a site sacred to many tribes in the South-
western United States.  We represented the Hualapai Tribe and Navajo and 
Hopi traditional practitioners in a lawsuit based upon the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act challenging the use of treated wastewater for snowmaking on 
the Peaks.  Unfortunately, an en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals overturned a favorable decision by a three judge panel of that court and 
the United States Supreme Court refused to review the decision.  Although our 
activities in 2011 were limited, we have continued trying to assist the tribes 
where possible, including working on a letter to Assistant Secretary of the In-
terior Larry Echohawk seeking his intervention in this matter and providing 
materials to an attorney for the International Indian Treaty Council filing a Ur-
gent Action/Early Warning complaint on the San Francisco Peaks issue to the 
United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

SACRED  LANDS /TRADITIONAL  CULTURAL  PROPERTIES  (continued)  
 We also supported the efforts of the Acoma Pueblo to provide better protection to Mount 
Taylor in Arizona by joining in an  amicus brief filed by the National Trust for Historic Pres-
ervation in a case involving the listing of Mount Taylor as a traditional cultural property.  Not 
only is Mount Taylor important to the pueblo, but Mount Taylor is also one of the four sacred 
mountains for the Navajo people.   The mountain is threatened by some proposed large -scale 
mining projects.  
 
AAIA also routinely provides information and training about the legal tools that are available 
to protect sacred places.  Sometimes this is in relation to specific places – for example, we 
provided information to the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) who have objected 
to the specific location of a proposed offshore wind energy project in Massachusetts known 
as Cape Wind because of its impact upon their ceremonies.  Other activities included partici-
pation in a training session for Forest Service and Park Service employees and in a sacred 
lands panel at a seminar sponsored by the Indigenous Environmental Network and the 
Women’s Earth Alliance.  
 
On the national level, the United States Forest Service began work on a revised sacred lands 
policy in 2011.  Together with the Medicine Wheel Coalition, AAIA consulted with the For-
est Service in regard to this policy and we worked closely with the National Congress of 
American Indians to develop detailed comments on the Forest Service proposal.  We also 
filed comments on behalf of the Medicine Wheel Coalition pertaining to the proposed 
revision of the national Programmatic Agreement between the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.  In addition, we submitted testi-
mony to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee urging the committee to consider enacting 
stronger protection for Native sacred sites as part of the effort to implement the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
  
Finally, we began working with the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana to prepare a 
cultural resources plan in connection with a mining operation that will soon be developed 
near their reservation at Otter Creek.  This plan is required by a settlement agreement 
reached between the Northern Cheyenne and the State of Montana.  We are also working 
with the tribe in connection with the proposed Tongue River Railroad project and their 
efforts to develop a plan, possibly through a Programmatic Agreement, to mitigate the 
impact of the proposed railroad upon historic and cultural sites.

SUSTAIN  AND PERPETUATE  CULTURES  AND LANGUAGES  
REPATRIATION  
 The repatriation of ancestral remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural 
patrimony to tribes redresses a long standing human rights violation and helps to heal the his-
torical trauma suffered by tribal communities and peoples caused by the looting of their an-
cestors’ grave sites and the loss of sacred objects and cultural patrimony.  AAIA played an 
integral role in obtaining the enactment of the Native American Graves Protection and  
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990 mandating repatriation by federal agencies and feder-
ally-funded museums.  In 2011, we continued efforts to promote its effective implementation.  
AAIA’s Executive Director wrote a chapter on the history of NAGPRA for a book on the  
implementation of NAGPRA that will be published by Oregon State University.  AAIA also 
submitted testimony to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in connection with its NAGPRA 
Oversight hearing in June, and comments to the Department of Interior in response to its  
request for feedback on its NAGPRA regulations.  
 
In 2011, AAIA also started an important new project addressing the issue of international  
repatriation.  The issue of repatriation was once thought to be an issue contained within the 
borders of the United States. However, Native American communities are increasingly find-
ing their ancestors’ remains and cultural items within international repositories.  An estimated 
1-2 million Native American ancestral remains and cultural items are now believed to be  
located in international repositories. Yet no law currently exists that requires international 
repatriation as NAGPRA is only applicable to federal agencies and federally funded institu-
tions within the jurisdiction of the United States.  
 
AAIA’s International Repatriation Project is seeking to address international repatriation on 
the tribal, national, and international level in collaborative partnership with Native American 
communities. We assist communities with researching international collections (because 
many communities do not know where their ancestral remains and cultural items are located), 
and international repatriation consultations and claims, when requested.  
 
During 2011, a number of activities took place.  A French anthropology student intern created 
a database for museums in France, as well as charts and maps that help show the movement 
of collectors connected with these museums and the eras in which ancestral remains and cul-
tural items were predominantly collected. The database includes important information that a  
8    
SUSTAIN  AND PERPETUATE  CULTURES  AND LANGUAGES  
REPATRIATION  (continued)  
 tribe may need in order to substantiate an international repatriation claim, such as how and 
where the museum obtained the object, which tribe or tribes are associated with the object, 
when the object was acquired and other pertinent information.  
 
These resources will soon be available on a password protected International Repatriation 
Project website once the site is officially launched. We also have databases for the University 
of Aberdeen/Marischal Museum (Aberdeen, Scotland), Museums Glasgow (17 Museums in 
Glasgow, Scotland), and we have a partial listing of collections at the Berlin Ethnology  
Museum (Berlin, Germany).  Currently, we have contacts at most museums throughout Scot-
land, some in England, and some in Germany and Austria.  
 
In the meantime, we have a working website for tribes to use to assist with international repa-
triation efforts. The site is password protected in order to protect culturally sensitive informa-
tion. It includes information about cultural heritage and museum laws of different countries, 
information that continues to be expanded as more research takes place.  The privacy of the 
site also allows tribes to speak freely with each other about experiences in international repa-
triation on a message board.  
 
In 2011, we also began work on an International Repatriation Guide  for tribes to help them 
more easily navigate the international repatriation process.  The Manual will provide first -
hand accounts of international repatriations, an analysis of the processes involved, and a step -
by-step guide to help Native communities proceed with requests, information gathering,  
research, obtaining resources, and providing ways to minimize costs along the way.  
 
We are also beginning to establish a network of indigenous volunteers who have repatriated 
internationally, are able to assist tribes with institutional introductions to museums, and are 
willing to help other Native communities by mentorship throughout the process.  
 
AAIA is also directly involved with three Indian tribes that are looking into repatriation from 
overseas collections, providing some research assistance and helping to develop repatriation 
strategies.

SUSTAIN  AND PERPETUATE  CULTURES  AND LANGUAGES  
 LANUAGE  PRESERVATION  
 Having a website with all of our native language materials readily available has always been our 
dream.  In 2011, this became a reality!  On the website, you can download over 100 children’s 
books, songs, posters, art and videos.  The website is the first of its kind.  The navigation buttons 
are in Dakotah and subtitled in English.  Free Native American language learning products can be 
downloaded from the website.  Most of the books were written by the Treasured Elders of the 
AAIA Native Language Revitalization Project language program, with help from other staff, and 
can be downloaded as a .pdf file for free or a hard copy can be ordered on the website.   Contribu-
tions can be made on the website to ensure that the materials remain free and to assist the AAIA 
Native Language Revitalization Program to continue creating language learning materials.  We 
have also included a section in the website for other languages and invite tribes to convert our 
materials into any Native language.  The website also includes a computer -based game for learn-
ing the Dakotah language which is targeted for students in Kindergarten through Second 
Grade.   It includes four separate video/audio games, including matching and memory card 
games.  The game features the art of Lakota artist Pamela Obeslo, who has created over 1000 
original pieces of art for the AAIA Native Language Program by illustrating over 120 children’s 
books.  These books are available in both the Dakotah and Lakotah languages and can be trans-
lated into other Native languages.   
 
 In 2011, we also completed what we call our “Dick and Jane Project.”   This project was the 
creation of 20 new children’s early reader books.  We commissioned two teachers to review all of 
the books and create a simple lesson plan to go with each book.  Each book has a simple eight 
page story followed by a more complex eight page story on the same topic.  These were all beau-
tifully illustrated by Ms. Obeslo.  These books and lesson plans were provided to all of the 
schools in Dakotah and then translated into the Lakotah language.  
 
We also operated a Master -Apprentice Program whereby one master speaker was paired with two 
learners.  The teams spoke Dakotah to each other throughout the year while doing everyday ac-
tivities together.  As technology has arrived on many reservations, although not as available as 
through the nation, the master and apprentices also talked with each other frequently on cell 
phones in Dakotah!  
 
On the national level, w e participated in the National Native Language Revitalization Summit in 
Washington D.C. in June, including visits to Congressional staff to emphasize the importance of 
funding Native language programs.

PROTECT  SOVEREIGNTY , CONSTITIONAL , LEGAL  AND HUMAN  RIGHTS  AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  
NATIVE  RELIGIOUS  FREEDOM  
 In addition to our work on sacred lands, we have also been part of a coalition of tribes and 
Indian organizations seeking to protect the right of Native peoples to possess and utilize  
eagles and other sacred birds for traditional ceremonial and cultural purposes.  A series of 
meetings has been held with officials of the Justice and Interior Department, as well as with 
Congressional staff, in which AAIA has participated.  In response to this advocacy, the  
Department of Justice has made two proposals to (at least partially) address the issues raised 
about overzealous federal law enforcement of federal statutes in tribal communities:  (1)  
Development of a formal Justice Department policy that it will not prosecute members of fed-
erally recognized tribes that possess eagles and eagle feathers – that it will only prosecute 
those who are selling eagles, eagle feathers and other protected birds; and  (2) Development 
of a training course for tribal and federal wildlife enforcement staff, with the goal of moving 
toward delegation of federal authority to tribes who have the capacity to take over these func-
tions.    
 
In response to this proposal, we worked closely with the National Congress of American In-
dians (NCAI) as they developed their response to the proposals and submitted comments of 
our own which focused upon (1) ensuring that the Justice Department policy (if it is to be 
adopted) is not narrower than the existing Interior Department Morton policy in terms of who 
is covered by the policy (the Morton policy uses the term “American Indians”), and (2)  
encouraging the development of Memoranda of Understanding between tribes and the federal 
government concerning enforcement issues.  We anticipate a revised policy will be finalized 
in 2012.

PROTECT  SOVEREIGNTY , CONSTITIONAL , LEGAL  AND HUMAN  RIGHTS  AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  
FEDERAL  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  
 By obtaining Federal acknowledgment of their tribal status, the sovereign actions of Indian 
tribes are recognized by the federal government and they become eligible for a wide variety 
of federal programs that are available only to tribes recognized by the federal government.  
Because federal recognition strengthens the ability of Indian tribes and their members to sur-
vive and thrive in the 21st Century, we have long worked with federally unrecognized tribes 
seeking federal acknowledgement.  It is a time consuming and resource intensive process re-
quiring massive documentation to prove continued tribal existence.  
 
One tribe that AAIA has worked with for more than twenty years is the Piro/Manso/Tiwa 
Tribe of Las Cruces, New Mexico.  Their petition has been under active consideration by the 
Department of Interior since January 2010, but no decision had been issued as of the end of 
2011.  
 
In addition, we worked to support the efforts of the Nanticoke Lenni Lenape Tribal Nation of 
New Jersey and other New Jersey tribes to have their recognition by the state of New Jersey 
reaffirmed.  AAIA’s Executive Director testified before a committee of the New Jersey State 
Senate and submitted an analysis of the meaning of state recognition in regard to gaming and 
federal recognition to the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services.  
 
We also prepared some legal research for the Houma Nation of Louisiana in regard to the  
denial of their claims following the BP oil spill.  Their request for aid was denied because 
they are not federally recognized.  
 
Finally, we submitted testimony to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee advocating for  
reform of the federal acknowledgment process as part of the effort to implement the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

PROTECT  SOVEREIGNTY , CONSTITIONAL , LEGAL  AND HUMAN  RIGHTS  AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  
INDIAN  CHILD  WELFARE  
 AAIA has worked actively in the field of Indian child welfare for more than four decades.  
AAIA studies and advocacy were the catalyst for the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, an 
Act designed to provide legal protections to Indian children and families and promote tribal 
involvement in decision -making involving their children and families who are at risk.  Since 
that time, we have worked to promote the full implementation of the ICWA and to assist 
tribes in obtaining adequate resources for their child welfare programs by successfully advo-
cating for expanded tribal eligibility under Title IV -B of the Social Security Act which pro-
vides funding for child welfare services and Title IV -E (entitlement program for foster care 
and adoption assistance) in the Fostering Connections to Success legislation passed in 2008.  
 
In 2011, we have continued our active efforts to protect the best interests of Indian children 
and families by promoting more effective compliance with the letter and spirit of ICWA.  
AAIA worked very closely with Washington tribal advocates and attorneys and the National 
Indian Child Welfare Association in support of the tribes’ successful effort to enact a Wash-
ington State Indian Child Welfare Act.  The Washington ICWA codifies in Washington law 
the main provisions of the federal ICWA.  This helps to ensure that state courts, attorneys and 
others involved with the state legal system incorporate ICWA protections into their everyday 
practice.  Secondly, the Act clarifies how the federal law should be implemented and 
expands upon its protections.  Among the most meaningful additions are provisions 
which define “active efforts”, “best interests” and “qualified expert witnesses”, modify 
the placement preferences and improve procedures for identifying Indian children, in-
cluding recognizing tribal decisions on membership as conclusive.  
 
We have also provided technical assistance to advocates working on a Michigan Indian 
Family Preservation Act and to an Arizona legislator working on legislation in Ari-
zona.  Finally, we provided training for D.C. city government social workers and attor-
neys on the requirements of ICWA that involve the identification of Indian children 
and providing notice to Indian tribes.  
 
In 2011, we also dedicated significant resources to promoting the implementation of 
the tribal provisions in the Fostering Connections legislation and to impacting future 
policy decisions pertaining to Title IV -E.  Our activities have included the following:    
14    
PROTECT  SOVEREIGNTY , CONSTITIONAL , LEGAL  AND HUMAN  RIGHTS  AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  
INDIAN  CHILD  WELFARE  (continued)  
  
 Participated in a coalition of child welfare advocacy groups (known as the Partnership to 
Protect Children and Strengthen Families) that is working to develop broad child welfare 
financing reform legislation.  
 
 Served on an expert panel convened by the American Public Human Services Association 
that developed recommendations as to how Title IV -E Child and Family Services Re-
views (CFSRs) conducted by the federal government should be modified.  A number of 
provisions regarding Indian children and collaboration between states and Indian tribes 
were included as a result of our participation.  
 
 Submitted comments to the Children’s Bureau on reform of the CFSR process  
 
 Met with the Special Assistant to the Commissioner of the Administration on Children, 
Youth and Families and other HHS and Children’s Bureau staff, and House and Senate 
staff to discuss Title IV -E implementation issues.  
 
 Provided training on Title IV -E’s legal requirements to the Casey Family Programs In-
dian child welfare staff and at the annual conference of the National Indian Child Welfare 
Association.  
 
Finally, AAIA was active in the effort to obtain the reauthorization of the Promoting Safe 
and Stable Families Act which provides child welfare funding for states and tribes pursu-
ant to Title IV -B of the Social Security Act.  Together with the National Indian Child 
Welfare Association (NICWA), we submitted testimony to a House hearing on the reau-
thorization urging that the 2006 provisions increasing the allocation for tribes be retained.  
We also asked that tribes be included in the court -improvement program that is part of 
Title IV -B; they were not eligible previously.  We also met with House and Senate staff 
to advance these proposals.  This advocacy was successful and $1 million in child welfare 
court improvement money for tribal courts was included in the Title IV -B reauthorization 
signed into law by President Obama.

PROTECT  SOVEREIGNTY , CONSTITIONAL , LEGAL  AND HUMAN  RIGHTS  AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  
JUVENILE  JUSTICE  
 Together with the National Indian Child Welfare Association (NICWA), and with the support 
of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, we convened a meeting in 2011 of tribal leaders, tribal 
court judges, individuals who have knowledge about or experience working with juvenile  
issues in a tribal context, and individuals more broadly involved with efforts to develop alter-
natives to detention for juveniles through the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative 
(JDAI).  The purpose of the meeting was to: (1) share the experience of tribes, states and  
localities working with tribes on JDAI, including a discussion of barriers that may have lim-
ited the efficacy of JDAI in this context, (2) provide tribal representatives with the opportu-
nity to share their perspectives on juvenile justice issues, and (3) discuss and brainstorm 
about next steps that might be taken to utilize JDAI and other strategies more effectively to 
improve tribal juvenile justice systems and address disparities in the treatment of Native 
Americans by federal and state juvenile justice systems.  
  
This work will continue in 2012.

  Dear Association on American Indian Affairs,  
 
I would like to thank everyone who is  
involved with the Association on American 
Indian Affairs for selecting me to receive one 
of your scholarships. I was pleasantly  
surprised and very grateful and just wanted 
to express my thankfulness.   
 
It is always nice to have some outside finan-
cial support, especially when single parents 
have small children.  I cannot thank your  
organization enough for the opportunity to 
further my education.

Dear AAIA Adolph Van Pelt Donors,  
 
Greetings from Northwest New Mexico!  The Van Pelt scholarship 
money has been very useful with my tuition and costs.   
 
As an update, this past fall semester has been the most challeng-
ing of all since I began school.  I plan to continue and finish the 
requirements for the degree of Associates of Arts in Physical  
Education here at San Juan College.   
 
Again, thank you for your support in my educational endeavors!  
 
Sincerely,

Dear AAIA,  
 
I am both honored and grateful to have been 
selected for the Elizabeth and Sherman Asche 
Memorial Scholarship.  
 
I am excited to report that the Temple Univer-
sity School of Medicine has built into the cur-
riculum Doctoring sessions on cultural sensitiv-
ity and disparities in healthcare.  I am confident 
that these lessons, combined with the more 
traditional medicinal science class, will shape 
me into an informed doctor who can address 
the social issues facing our own communities.  
I feel that I am truly thriving in the medical 
school and am so thankful for your support.

   SUMMER  CAMPS  
 The Association on American Indian Affairs (AAIA) has been providing seed money for 
youth summer camps in the areas of cultural preservation, language preservation and health 
and wellness/diabetes education since the 1970’s.  These camps are run by Native run organi-
zations and tribes from across the country, and are designed to strengthen and preserve the 
uniqueness of the individual culture of the tribe by providing opportunities for their youth to 
learn traditional cultural practices from tribal elders and others with specific expertise, while 
preparing them to live in the 21st Century.  Without these opportunities, many of these youth 
would not learn the traditions of their culture, nor would they achieve academically or in the 
larger society.   
 
Many of the activities in which the youth participate, such as regalia making, archery, plant 
identification, and cooking, are meant to strengthen cultural ties.  Native language is used to 
instruct many of the activities, allowing students to strengthen or learn their Native language.  
Healthy lifestyles are stressed, allowing campers to develop a strong sense of self -esteem, 
build good relationship skills, develop team building skills, and engage in healthy eating hab-
its and physical exercise, all of which have been shown to lower the use of drugs and alcohol, 
prevent juvenile delinquency, and lower suicide rates as well as increase the likelihood that 
students will complete high school and go on to college.  
 
Tribes and Native run organizations that have existing youth summer camps apply to AAIA 
for seed grants to fund specific needs that, without outside funding, would have to be elimi-
nated or reduced.  In drastic cases, if no outside funding is received, the camp may be can-
celled.  AAIA provides funding for critical portions of the camp such as transportation, sup-
plies for activities, camp cooks, stipends for peer counselors and honorariums for elders 
whose wisdom and insight enables youth to learn the unique traditions of their cultures.  
 
AAIA provided funding to 13 camps for the 2011 summer camp season.

ANNUAL  MEETING  OF THE MEMBERS  AND NATIVE  AMERICAN  FILM EVENT   
 
AAIA sponsored its 7th Annual Native American Short film Showcase  at the Tribeca Screen-
ing Room in New York City in November 2011.  The event, which is held in conjunction with 
our Annual Meeting of the Members, consisted of several short pieces by Native film makers 
that explored a variety of contemporary issues of concern to Native Americans.  
 
During the meeting, three new board members were elected to the Board.  After the program 
and financial updates were provided for the members, AAIA proudly honored John Haworth, 
Director of the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian, 
for his significant contributions to the preservation of Native arts and culture.  Mr. Haworth 
was the driving force behind the Infinity of Nations exhibit, a changing exhibit which opened 
in 2010, and the NMAI Dyker Pavillion, at 6,000 foot exhibition area.
