VAWA has played a critical role in bolstering and improving the protection of Indigenous women and children,” said State of New Mexico Indian Affairs Cabinet Secretary and NM MMIWR Task Force Chairwoman, Lynn Trujillo. “The restored authority in VAWA expands tribes’ legal authority to keep their communities safe, and provides adequate resources to support healing and justice for everyone impacted by violence. This life saving legislation is a significant step toward protecting Indigenous women, men, children and LGBT2S+ relatives against all forms of violence.”“For too long, non-Native perpetrators of violent crimes against Native women and children have acted with impunity. The 2022 Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization restores the authority of tribal courts to hold non-Natives accountable for sexual assault, child abuse, stalking, sex trafficking, and assaults on tribal law enforcement officers on tribal lands, in addition to the restored authority over intimate partner violence.  The Pueblo of Pojoaque, like many tribes, is getting to work to strengthen its tribal code to restore its criminal jurisdiction over these crimes and ensure that tribal lands are safer for everyone,” said Kim McGinnis, PhD, Esq., Chief Judge, Pueblo of Pojoaque.The bill signed on Wednesday authorizes all current VAWA grant programs until 2027. Additionally, it expands special criminal jurisdiction of tribal courts to cover non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse and sex trafficking, and it supports a pilot program to help survivors in Alaska Native villages.The bill also increases services for survivors in the LGBTQ+ community and increases support for culturally specific services and services in rural communities.###Filed Under: News ReleasesAs a tribal coalition, CSVANW does not provide emergency or directs services.If you are in an unsafe situation or need immediate assistance please dial 911.For a safe, confidential way to talk with someone right now, please call:Rape Abuse Incest National Network: 1-800-656-4673 (HOPE)www.rainn.orgNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE)www.ndvh.orgStrong Hearts Native Helpline: 1-844-762-8483www.strongheartshelpline.orgWho Are WeWe focus our work on communities and systems.
