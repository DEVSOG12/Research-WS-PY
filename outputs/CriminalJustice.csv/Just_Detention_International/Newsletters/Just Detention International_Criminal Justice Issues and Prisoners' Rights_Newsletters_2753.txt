We should 
not be tolerating rape in prison and 
rape in prison and 
we should not be making jokes about it in our popular culture.
— President Barack Obama
When andrew learned last 
year that Indiana had opted 
out of national standards to 
end sexual abuse behind bars, 
he was devastated. Andrew knew better 
than anyone how badly the state needed 
strong rules — which were mandated by 
the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) 
— to ensure the safety of inmates. Over the previous four years, he had been sexu-
ally assaulted multiple times while in an 
Indiana state prison. 
In a letter to JDI, Andrew didn’t mince 
words in criticizing his governor, Mike 
Pence. “It was shameful of the governor to 46 States — and Counting
See 46 and Counting, continued on page 3In august, i received a phone call from 
Michelle Norsworthy, a JDI Survivor 
Council member. Michelle called to 
share amazing news: after nearly three 
decades behind bars, she had been released 
from prison that morning. 
As you can imagine, I had many questions for 
Michelle, about how it felt finally to be free, and whether she had the support she needed 
to start settling into life on the outside. Yet 
Michelle wanted to 
talk about the fight 
to stop rape in pris-
on — and what she 
could do to help.
Michelle’s unwav-
ering commitment 
comes as no surprise to those who know 
her. Michelle, who is 
a transgender woman, endured years of sexual 
abuse in men’s prisons in California. Work-
ing with JDI, she pushed the state to make its 
prisons safer, she worked as an inmate peer 
educator focusing on sexual abuse preven-
tion, and, in April, she won a landmark fed-eral court case. Given her accomplishments 
inside of prison, I can only imagine what she 
will achieve now that she is out.
Michelle’s release was not the only news that 
gave JDI a boost recently. Just weeks earlier, 
President Obama made a historic speech in 
which he decried popular culture’s danger-ously flippant attitudes toward prisoner rape. 
The President’s comments are evidence of 
a crucial shift in the national conversation about this violence — a shift made possible 
by survivors, like Michelle Norsworthy.

one, know that Indiana prisons need PREA 
big time.”
 With survivors like Andrew in mind, JDI 
launched a national campaign targeting In-
diana and the handful of other states that op-
posed PREA, demanding that they change 
course and do the right thing. One year later, the impact of this advocacy is clear. Two of 
the six states that rejected PREA in 2014 — 
Florida and Indiana — reversed their posi-tions; Texas, which had been overtly hostile 
to PREA, also signaled that it was receptive 
to its reforms. These states joined 32 others in

Vast Majority of States Commit to Lifesaving  
Standards Aimed at Ending Prisoner Rape
“I Know I Can Make It  
Because I’m a Survivor”
Devastated by the abuse, Vincent sought 
help from prison officials, doctors, and even 
a local magistrate. No matter where he 
turned, his pleas fell on deaf ears. The story of  
another South African survivor, Francois, 
follows a similar trajectory. Francois was 
raped multiple times after staff placed him in 
a cell with a known sex offender. Despite his 
suffering, Francois never received any coun-seling or support. 
These survivors chose to tell their stories 
in the hope that doing so would save oth-
ers from abuse. In his testimony, Vincent 
includes a powerful call to action, “To the 
people who are in the position to give help: 
listen sensitively, and help people like me report sexual violence so we can live again. 
To the Department of Correctional Services: 
stop this from happening.”
JDI-SA will continue to add testimony to 
the Digital Stories project. For many survi-
vors, the simple act of sharing their story can 
make a world of difference in their healing. 
This certainly was the case for Vincent, who 
explained, “I know I can make it because I’m 
a survivor.” The most powerful weapon in the fight to end prisoner rape is survivor 
testimony. The courage of survivors 
to tell their stories has made all of 
our victories possible, including the passage 
of the U.S.’s landmark Prison Rape Elimina-
tion Act. 
It is not only survivors in the U.S. who are 
making a difference. Thanks to a JDI-South 
Africa multimedia project, Digital Stories, 
people who were raped in South African prisons are beginning to share their experi-
ences publicly for the first time — and de-
manding government action. 
Digital Stories sheds light on the crisis of 
prisoner rape in South Africa, while also 
making it clear that this violence is prevent-
able. Take Vincent’s story. When Vincent ar-rived at prison, it was clear to staff that he 
was vulnerable. Yet they did not protect him 
— instead, they taunted him. After sizing up Vincent in the booking area, an officer said 
to his colleague, “Here is the rubbish.” Their 
hostility sent a clear message: Vincent was 
fair game. Later that day, he was raped by one 
gang member, and then another. TTransgender Inmates 
Must Also Be Safe
Corrections agencies almost 
always house transgender people 
based on their birth gender in-
stead of their gender identity. 
For example, transgender women — in-
cluding those who have expressed their 
female identity for decades — are typi-
cally placed in men’s facilities, where they 
are prime targets for sexual abuse. 
JDI has long argued that transgender in-
mates’ own views on where they would be safest should be paramount in housing 
decisions. So it came as welcome news 
when the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) released a new policy 
in July that calls for, among other things, serious consideration of housing transgen-
der detainees by their gender identity, if 
they believe that is the safest option. ICE is poised to become the largest corrections 
agency — and the only federal one — to 
have such a policy in place. C

september 2015 | action  updateA s a jdi supporter,  chances are 
that you’ve signed a petition, 
called your governor, or written 
a holiday card to a prisoner rape 
survivor. Such contributions, combined with 
the courage of survivors to tell their stories, 
have helped JDI become the force for posi-
tive change that we are today. 
But there’s another, less known yet immense-
ly important, factor that has also contributed 
to our success: solid data. Since 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has con-
ducted anonymous surveys with hundreds 
of thousands of adults and children in U.S. 
detention facilities. The resulting series of re-
ports has shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that prisoner rape is a nationwide crisis — 
and has also helped guide our efforts to stop 
this abuse.
The BJS’ most recent survey of adult prisons 
and jails was completed in 2012, which is also the year of its last survey of youth fa-The Power of Good Data
cilities. Unfortunately, BJS has no immediate plans to conduct more surveys. The main rea-
son is a lack of funding. 
Later this year, JDI will begin pushing Con-
gress to set aside more funds in the next bud-A46 and Counting

standards, according to the Department of 
Justice’s tally. Eleven governors certified 
that their state had already put the stan-
dards in place, up from just two the previ-ous year. 
The widespread, and growing, embrace of 
PREA is a victory. But the most important 
measure of PREA’s success is what hap-pens inside prisons, not in governors’ offic-
es. Fortunately, many corrections agencies 
are proving that their states’ commitment is not an empty promise. Tens of thousands 
of staff have been trained to prevent sexual 
abuse. Hundreds of thousands of inmates 
have been taught about their right to be 
free from rape. In a growing number of facilities, prisoners are getting free, confi-
dential rape crisis counseling — which was 
unthinkable a few years ago. 
PREA’s rollout is changing — and saving 
— people’s lives. But although the PREA standards are increasingly seen as the norm 
among corrections leaders, four states re-
fused to commit to them in 2015: Alaska, 
Arkansas, Idaho, and Utah. Further, even 
in the 46 PREA-adopting states, many in-mates are still not safe. 
JDI will continue to push all states to 
honor the PREA standards. This is par-
ticularly important in Texas, which has 
the most dangerous prisons in the country.  
Fortunately, Texas’s new governor, Greg Abbott, has distanced himself from his predecessor, Rick Perry, whose cynical 
campaign to sabotage PREA, in Texas 
and nationwide, was defeated. But Gover-nor Abbott stopped short of promising to 
adopt the PREA standards fully; instead, 
he said that Texas would follow the rules “wherever feasible.” 
“It is troubling that the Department of 
Justice is allowing Governor Abbott the 
option to ignore provisions that he deems infeasible,” said Lovisa Stannow, JDI’s Ex-
ecutive Director. “No other governor has 
been granted this choice. PREA is not an à la carte menu. The law’s intent is clear — 
every provision must be met.”R ecently, on a humid South Car-
olina morning, roughly 100 state 
prison officials gathered in Co-
lumbia, the capital, for a training 
on the PREA standards led by JDI. The goal 
was not simply to get officials to memorize 
regulations or to help them pass a PREA au-
dit. Instead, we aimed to show that adopting 
PREA would help spark a lifesaving shift in the way those working inside prisons think 
about the people in their custody.  
By the end of the training, it was clear that 
our messages were sinking in. Staff began to 
see that some of their commonly held beliefs 
about prisoners — beliefs they had taken for 
granted for years — were harmful. As one officer put it, “We have to get out of the 
mindset of ‘He committed a terrible crime, 
he does not deserve the same rights as ev-eryone else.’ I am part of that mindset. No, 
change will not happen overnight, but this 
training is a good start.”
The training was one of many important 
steps that the South Carolina Department 
of Corrections (SCDC), with JDI’s help, has 
taken in the past two years. With support from a federal grant, SCDC and JDI have 
worked together to revamp the agency’s pol-
icies, making sure that they spell out what staff have to do to prevent sexual violence, 
and to respond appropriately to any prisoner 
who reports abuse. A New Mindset in South Carolina
SCDC has also put in place a peer education program, where specially selected and trained 
prisoners have taught more than 3,500 fellow 
inmates about their rights, and how to stay safe. The success of the program shows that 
some of the most effective teachers of this 
material are prisoners themselves — like Ari-
matia. He said, “When I am able to help oth-
er prisoners, it is rewarding. I take great pride in being part of changing the prison culture.”
Much of the credit for the agency’s turn-
around belongs to John Barkley, the statewide 
PREA Coordinator. A corrections veteran 
with 23 years of experience, John knows that 
changing the agency’s practices, and especial-
ly its culture, will be frustrating at times. But he has never shied away from a challenge. “I 
truly believe that we can turn SCDC into a 
system that others look to as a model,” said John. “PREA has given us a roadmap. If we 
keep following it, we will be able to ensure 
that every person inside these walls is treated with dignity and kept safe.” 
The strides already made by SCDC show that 
John’s optimism is well-founded. Yet John and 
other SCDC leaders are also realistic, recog-nizing that much work remains. “It says a lot 
that SCDC leaders aren’t stopping at just cre-
ating good policies,” said JDI’s Cynthia Tot-ten. “They understand that culture change is 
tough work that takes a long time. Their level 
of commitment is going to save lives.”Rget so that BJS can continue this pivotal work. In these early years of PREA implementa-
tion, we need strong research to show where 
the standards are working and where they are not; where inmates are safe and where they 
are not. 
I n august, jdi’s Survivor Council added 
more expertise and leadership, bring-
ing on board three new members: Kerri 
Cecil, Pamela Prohoroff, and Maribel 
Reister. The Council’s newest members are 
based in Southern California, but their com-
mitment to ending prisoner rape extends na-
tionwide, and even globally. 
Kerri is a filmmaker and activist promoting 
the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans-
gender people. A transgender woman, Kerri spent 20 years in and out of men’s prisons 
in California, where she was sexually abused 
repeatedly by staff and inmates. Today, she 
helps JDI train advocates on how to provide 
quality services to survivors behind bars. In addition, she is working on a documentary 
about Los Angeles’ transgender community, 
highlighting its challenges and successes. JDI Survivor Council Grows Even Stronger
Maribel was one of the first-ever PREA peer educators, as part of JDI’s trailblaz-
ing program at the California Institution 
for Women. In this role, she helped teach  
fellow prisoners about their absolute right  
to be safe from sexual abuse. Sadly, she knew first-hand of the devastating impact of sexual 
violence. A survivor of staff sexual miscon-
duct, Maribel has continued to speak out against prisoner rape since her release from 
prison in 2014. 
Pamela, who served one year in a California 
state prison, works as a curriculum devel-
oper for the United Nations. She also has 
years of experience as an international mar-
keting executive. In addition to serving on JDI’s Survivor Council, Pamela volunteers 
with a ministry group that helps inmates  
at Las Colinas, a jail in San Diego County. I40%of transgender 
inmates reported being sexually abused in U.S. prisons in one year
The recent BJS findings on sexual abuse among transgender inmates give a devastatingly clear picture of 
this country’s failure to protect transgender people behind bars.

was vulnerable. Yet they did not protect him 
— instead, they taunted him. After sizing up Vincent in the booking area, an officer said 
to his colleague, “Here is the rubbish.” Their 
hostility sent a clear message: Vincent was 
fair game. Later that day, he was raped by one 
gang member, and then another. TTransgender Inmates 
Must Also Be Safe
Corrections agencies almost 
always house transgender people 
based on their birth gender in-
stead of their gender identity. 
For example, transgender women — in-
cluding those who have expressed their 
female identity for decades — are typi-
cally placed in men’s facilities, where they 
are prime targets for sexual abuse. 
JDI has long argued that transgender in-
mates’ own views on where they would be safest should be paramount in housing 
decisions. So it came as welcome news 
when the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) released a new policy 
in July that calls for, among other things, serious consideration of housing transgen-
der detainees by their gender identity, if 
they believe that is the safest option. ICE is poised to become the largest corrections 
agency — and the only federal one — to 
have such a policy in place. C
