Founded in 1980, JDI is the only organization in the U.S. – and the world – dedicated exclusively to ending sexual abuse behind bars. We hold government officials accountable for prisoner rape; challenge the attitudes and misperceptions that allow sexual abuse to flourish; and make sure that survivors get the help they need.Sexual abuse in detention is absolutely preventable. Prisons and jails with committed leaders, good policies, and sound practices can keep people safe.We work with policymakers, advocates, and corrections officials to protect the basic human rights of people in detention, in the U.S. and globally. All of our work is informed by the wisdom and experiences of prisoner rape survivors. We go inside facilities every day to talk directly with prisoners and staff about what they really need to be safe.When the government removes someone’s freedom, it takes on an absolute responsibility to keep that person safe. No matter what crime someone may have committed, rape is not part of the penalty.“I used to feel shame and humiliation about what happened to me in that Texas jail. Eventually, I came to realize that it was not my shame — it was my country’s shame.”Tom Cahill, former JDI President“I’d like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you and your organization’s support. It really means a lot to have someone in society lookingat me and seeing me as a human being and not just another number that no one cares about.”Anonymous prisoner rape survivorSIGN UP FOR EMAIL UPDATESHEADQUARTERS3325 Wilshire Blvd,Suite 340Los Angeles, CA 90010T(213) 384-1400F(213) 384-1411info@justdetention.orgEAST COAST OFFICE1100 H St, NWSuite 400Washington DC, 20005T(202) 506-3333Donate
