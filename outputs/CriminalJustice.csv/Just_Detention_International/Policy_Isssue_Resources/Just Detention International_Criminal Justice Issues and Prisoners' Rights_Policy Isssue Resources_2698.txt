Sexual abuse is a largely hidden 
reality in detention facilities in 
the philippines, in violation of 
domestic law and international 
human rights treaties to which the philip-
pines is a state party.2 although there is lit -
tle official data on the incidence of rape be -
hind bars in the philippines, the country’s 
prisons and jails suffer from the conditions 
that lead to sexual abuse, including severe 
overcrowding, lack of adequate supervi -
sion, failure to separate the most vulnerable 
inmates from likely predators, widespread 
homophobia, and a culture of silence that 
results in impunity for corrupt officials.3  
In one of the few official studies conducted on prisoner rape in the philippines, four 
percent of 552 female jail inmates surveyed 
reported that they had experienced sexual 
abuse while detained.4 seven of the women 
had been raped, while others were subjected 
to abusive conduct including sexual touch -
ing, kissing, corrections officials exposing 
their genitalia, and attempted rape.5 a more 
recent study found that ten percent of wom -
en detainees had been sexually abused by jail 
officials prior to their transfer to the Correc -
tional Institution for Women (CIW).6 
In 2001, in response to these and other re -
ports of sexual abuse of detained women 
by police, military, and prison officials, the Commission on Human rights of the 
philippines released a human rights adviso
-
ry, which noted that women known to have 
engaged in prostitution, who have com -
mitted minor crimes, or are alleged to have violated the philippines’ anti-vagrancy law are among those most likely to be subjected 
to sexual violence in custody.7 such abuses 
have continued unabated despite government 
efforts to address sexual violence against de -
tainees – including a 2001 pronouncement by the Bureau of Jail Management and penol
-
ogy (BJMp) that it had adopted a zero-tol -
erance policy toward staff sexual misconduct 
and plans for the formation of a government 
task force on sexual violence against women 
in detention.8
Juveniles are also frequently the targets of sexual abuse in philippine detention facilities. 
such abuse is often linked to the widespread 
failure to separate youth from adults in jails 
throughout the country, in violation of domes -
tic and international law.9 Despite the passage 
of the Comprehensive Juvenile Justice system 
and Welfare act of 2006,10 which requires that 
children in police custody be held separately 
from adult detainees and from detainees of 
the opposite sex, detained children continue 
to be placed deliberately in harm’s way.11 
Moreover, it is not clear what steps, if any, 
have been taken to implement a key provision 
in the law that prohibits law enforcement offi -
cials from sexually harassing or making sexual 
advances toward juveniles in their custody. 12 
Documentation of sexual violence in philip-
pine detention facilities has focused primarily 
on women detainees, juveniles, and political 
prisoners. However, there is growing evidence 
that sexual abuse is rampant throughout the 
country’s detention facilities.13 Gangs hold 
tremendous sway behind bars, and correc -
tions officials often cede power to so-called 
“mayores” (gang leaders) in an effort to preserve

International (JDI)
just Detention International ( JDI) is a 
human rights organization that seeks to 
end sexual abuse in all forms of detention. 
all of JDI ’s work takes place within the 
framework of international human rights 
laws and norms. The sexual assault of detain -
ees, whether committed by corrections staff 
or by inmates, is a crime and is recognized 
internationally as a form of torture.
JDI has three core goals for its work: to en -
sure government accountability for prisoner 
rape; to transform ill-informed public atti -
tudes about sexual violence in detention; and 
to promote access to resources for those who 
have survived this form of abuse.
 
JDI is concerned about the safety and well-
being of all detainees, including those held 
in adult prisons and jails, juvenile facilities, 
immigration detention centers, and police 
lock-ups, whether run by government agen -
cies or by private corporations on behalf of 
the government. 
When the government takes away someone’s 
freedom, it incurs a responsibility to pro -
tect that person’s safety. all inmates have 
the right be treated with dignity. No matter 
what crime someone has committed, sexual 
violence must never be part of the penalty.institutional order. Detainees who are vul -
nerable to abuse and extortion regularly seek 
protection from the gangs, often providing 
money or sex in return. 
The anti-r ape Law of 199714 and the rape 
Victim and assistance act of 199815 are 
among the laws already in place that help 
to address sexual violence in detention. No -
tably, in 2008, lawmakers also introduced 
to the philippine Congress the prison rape 
elimination act,16 legislation modeled after a 
United states law passed in 2003.17 The law 
calls for: the establishment of a zero-toler -
ance standard for sexual abuse in detention; 
collection of national data on the incidence of prisoner rape along with an examination of 
the best and worst performing detention fa -
cilities; and the provision of grants and tech -
nical assistance to support efforts to address 
the problem. other pending legislation calls 
for the separation of male and female detain -
ees and for the alleviation of overcrowding.18 
In 2009, the philippines’ compliance with the 
Convention against Torture will be reviewed 
by the U.N. Committee against Torture. The 
Committee has identified a number of issues 
to be considered as part of this review that 
are directly linked to the government’s fail -
ure in preventing and addressing sexual abuse 
behind bars.19
