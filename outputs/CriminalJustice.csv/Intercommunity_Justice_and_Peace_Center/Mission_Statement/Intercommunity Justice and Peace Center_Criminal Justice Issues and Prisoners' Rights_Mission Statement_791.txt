These areas have changed and evolved, dependent on community needs, from sanctuary for Central American refugees, to racial equality, to economic justice, to the environment, and more. Louise Akers, SC, served as IJPC’s first Coordinator.1987-1990In December of 1987 IJPC moved to St. Francis Seraph School and in 1990 to Peaslee Neighborhood Center.Early 1990sAs the issues shaped and shifted, the structure did likewise to provide more capacity. Additional organizational sponsors joined. In 1991, IJPC was incorporated and in 1992 was certified as a 501(c) (3) tax exempt educational organization. IJPC found a home and a sense of permanence. In 1992, Alice Gerdeman, CDP, began as the subsequent IJPC Coordinator.1997As a response to executions in Kentucky and Ohio becoming a probability, and then a reality, IJPC began a committee to oppose the death penalty. The committee became a local chapter of Ohioans to Stop Executions and was a presence at every execution. Through the creation of Families That Matter, with representatives of families who have or had members on death row, and Murder Victims’ Families for Reconciliation, the committee was steadfast in efforts to educate and advocate around the death penalty.2006The Northern Kentucky Justice and Peace Committee found a home within IJPC for those seeking to place more emphasis on Kentucky concerns. This committee has been meeting and planning programs since.IJPC held its first public peace dialogue using a process developed by staff and volunteers. Dialogues covered timely and divisive issues such as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.2010YES (Youth Educating Society) formed, bringing immigrant young adults and their allies together to develop leadership skills and work toward comprehensive immigration reform legislation.2011IJPC’s Coordinator, Sr. Alice Gerdeman, and the Families That Matter program were featured in the November 2011 issue of Cincinnati Magazine.2014 – 2015A series of stakeholder studies and advisory forums were held inviting donors, sponsor groups, community members, volunteers, and former staff to look at IJPC’s history and determine its future.
