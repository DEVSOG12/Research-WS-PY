Before the rise of mass incarceration, dozens of people would have their sentences commuted by the Board of Pardons every year. In current times, the process has been largely shut down, but we are steadily pushing to successfully reopen the door at the Board of Pardons.We campaign to have the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons recommend more people for commutation. We assist incarcerated people applying for commutation and help them navigate the process. We advocate with Prosecutors’ offices and support sympathetic victims’ family members when they want to speak out in support.From the time we began our campaign in 2018 to August 2022, we’ve seen 54 people sentenced to life without parole and ‘virtual life’ long term sentences recommended by the Board for commutation including 11 of our clients. In the full two decades before 2018 only 15 lifers were recommended. Of the 52 recommended since we began our campaign almost all of them have been released by the Governor. We’re moving the needle and we’ve been able to provide crucial support in a number of cases that directly led to the applicants getting the approval of the Board.Read about recent victories in our campaign for second chances at the Board of Pardons.Watch our ‘Reopening Hope at the Board of Pardons’ event.Listen to our podcast episode about the Board of Pardons.Read our report on the most recent Board of Pardons hearings (April 2022).“In my 29 years of incarceration, I spent my time working to change myself for the better. Eventually, I applied to have the Board of Pardons commute my life without parole sentence. Amistad Law Project stood by my side throughout the process. They reached out to the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office to advocate that they support my release and also helped me prepare for my interview at the Board of Pardons. In September of 2020, the Board voted unanimously to support my release from prison. Now I’m looking forward to rejoining the community and having a positive impact mentoring young people and working to help those in need.” - Francisco Mojica“Forty years ago, two brothers participated in the crime that resulted in my father’s death. When I learned that they were going before the Board of Pardons I wanted to advocate for their release, but I needed support. Amistad Law Project was there for me every step of the way--providing guidance and a shoulder to lean on--as I navigated this difficult process.In September of 2020, I testified for the two brothers at a public hearing because I felt they had long since served their time and deserved a second chance. Thankfully, the Board of Pardons voted to allow them to come home. Never forget that we can have a powerful effect when we speak our truths and act with compassion. I’m thankful to Amistad Law Project in supporting me on this journey”- Nancy LeichtnerRelatedJuly 17, 2022Today Rell, Felix and James Are Free: The Story of How We Got HereApril 28, 2022Redemption is Real: Majority of Lifers Granted Commutation at April HearingDecember 1, 2021Majority of Lifers Receive Commutation at December Board of Pardons HearingAbout ALPOur TeamContactSign UpDonateInstagramTwitterFacebook© 2021 Amistad Law Project.
