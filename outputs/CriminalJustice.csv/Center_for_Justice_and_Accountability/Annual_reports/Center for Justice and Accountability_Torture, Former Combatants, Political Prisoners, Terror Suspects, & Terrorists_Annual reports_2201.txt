ANNUAL REPORT   July 1, 2014 - June 30, 2015
1OUR MISSION
The Center for Justice and Accountability is an  
international human rights organization dedicated  
to deterring torture, war crimes, crimes against  
humanity and other severe human rights abuses 
around the world through litigation, policy advocacy 
and outreach in pursuit of truth, justice and redress 
for victims and survivors.
2MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
We are pleased to present you with our fiscal year 2014-2015 annual report.
In 1992, Bosnia endured a wave of ethnic violence as Serbian and Bosnian Serb armed forces  
launched a campaign of terror against the nation’s Muslim population. The Bosnian War, 
which ended in 1995, claimed the lives of as many as 100,000 people, and displaced more 
than 2.2 million others. The majority of those that perpetuated violence and aided in the 
massacre of their fellow citizens went unpunished. They were able to continue living and 
traveling freely, some joining the 1,900 suspected war criminals living in the United States. 
In 1998, the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) filed its first case. The defendant, 
Nikola Vuckovic, was a criminal living in the United States who tortured and killed his 
Muslim neighbors during the Bosnian War. The court found Vuckovic liable for torture, war 
crimes and other humanitarian abuses, and ordered him to pay his victims $140 million in 
compensatory damage. 
Since then, CJA has continued to leverage the fullest extent of the law to comprehensively  
and unequivocally ensure that perpetrators are held accountable for their horrific actions. 
Actively representing torture survivors in 19 countries from Somalia to El Salvador, Haiti  
to Colombia, Sri Lanka to Chile, CJA is relentless in our efforts to hold accountable  
perpetrators of some of the most egregious human rights crimes known to man.  
We are undaunted by the decades it may take to secure justice, or the legal and political 
obstacles that we must navigate. More than a decade later, we have won favorable  
judgments in all of our cases that have gone to trial.   
In every one of our cases, CJA builds a network of partners that includes in-country human rights defenders,  
survivors, refugee groups, other non-governmental human rights organizations, medical professionals, military 
and forensic experts, and law school clinics. In addition, CJA partners with pro bono law firms to litigate cases 
with us.  During the 2014-2015 fiscal year, CJA worked with 24 law firms, human rights clinics and legal consul -
tants that donated services valued at approximately $3 million.
This annual report is a testament to the critical role that CJA plays in building a future where the rule of law prevails, 
a future where all countries have the capacity, capability and political will to address past human rights crimes, and 
where all nations leverage their laws to deny safe haven to perpetrators who seek refuge within their borders.
We believe that our approach is uniquely suited to pursuing justice in the 21st century—it involves working 
within broad networks of organizations and individuals to serve the most marginalized among us—survivors  
of torture and other severe human rights abuses. Progress is not automatic or guaranteed. But working together 
for justice and accountability, it can be achieved.
With deep appreciation,
C. Dixon Osburn

3OUR STRATEGY
CJA uses the fullest extent of the law – often in savvy and  
innovative ways – to bring human rights abusers to justice.  
We use a unique combination of tools – litigation, transitional 
justice, and policy – to hold these perpetrators accountable. 
Litigation 
CJA prosecutes human rights abusers. Our cases address some of the world’s  
worst atrocities—from the genocide in Guatemala to the campaign of terror led by 
Pol Pot’s regime in Cambodia. We are relentless in the pursuit of justice and truth for 
those who have endured the horrors of torture, crimes against humanity and other 
severe human rights abuses.
Transitional Justice 
CJA has pioneered efforts in post-conflict countries to hold human rights abusers 
criminally accountable in national courts. We have worked on historic trials –  
including the Ríos Montt trial in Guatemala and the Accomarca Massacre trial  
in Peru. CJA believes that global justice requires a multi-layered approach, and  
we are proud to partner with NGOs worldwide in building the rule of law.
Policy 
CJA has played a significant role in developing human rights policy in the  
United States, including testifying before Congress in support of the Child  
Soldiers Accountability Act and the Genocide Accountability Act. Working with 
policymakers and civil society groups, CJA crafts and supports policies that ensure 
the effective prosecution of atrocity crimes, deny safe haven to their perpetrators, 
and protect and rehabilitate their victims.
4BOLIVIA
AMICUS  BRIEF  
The Killing of Indigenous Protesters
Mamani v. Berzain 
In 2003, former Bolivian President Gonzalo Daniel Sanchez de Lozada Sanchez Bustamente and former Defense 
Minister Carlos Sanchez Berzain ordered military forces to suppress popular anti-government protests with force. 
More than 67 people, the majority of whom were from indigenous minority communities, were killed, and more 
than 400 others were injured.  The survivors and families of the victims filed U.S. civil suits under the Alien Tort 
Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act in 2007, seeking justice for these human rights violations. 
In March 2015, CJA filed its second amicus brief in the case. We argue that the exhaustion of domestic remedies 
in Bolivia does not prevent claims under the TVPA.  
5CAMBODIA
LITIGATION
Atrocities Committed under the Khmer Rouge 
The Khmer Rouge Trials  
Cambodia experienced its most violent history during the short lived rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge  
regime.  From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge emptied cities and placed the population into forced labor  
camps. Those perceived to be loyal to the former Republic were executed. Nearly 2 million civilians died  
during the Khmer Rouge regime, and as many as 800,000 of these deaths were violent deaths. The crimes  
 left the country and its survivors destabilized, traumatized, and in need of justice.  
CJA represents 45 Cambodian Americans in a case against two former Khmer Rouge leaders accused of  
genocide, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. In August 2014, CJA helped to obtain a historic  
verdict which found Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan guilty of crimes against humanity. 
In October 2014, a second and final trial convened in Cambodia covering the remaining charges of genocide, 
forced marriage, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ECCC is conducting five impact hearings  
throughout the trial, one for each crime-based segment of the trial.  The impact hearings focus on the  
material, emotional, and physical harm of the civil parties. 
In August 2015, CJA traveled to Cambodia and participated in and contributed to a training on how to prepare 
civil parties for the second impact hearing related to the forced labor camps.  
6CHILE
LITIGATION 
Pinochet Coup and the Murder  
of Víctor Jara 
Jara v. Barrientos 
In 1973, Víctor Jara, a world-renowned folksinger  
and theater director, was one of Chile’s most notable  
social icons, famous for his outspoken messages of  
social equality and the plight of the working class.  
In the wake of the coup which placed Augusto  
Pinochet in power, Jara was among those taken to  
Chile Stadium,  notoriously the first mass detention  
center run by the new dictatorship. Víctor Jara  
was interrogated and tortured before being shot  
44 times: a warning to those who challenged  
Pinochet’s authority.
Representing Víctor Jara’s widow and daughters,  
CJA and pro bono co-counsel Chadbourne & Parke,  
LLP filed a civil suit in 2013 against Lieutenant Pedro  
Pablo Barrientos Nuñez (Barrientos), for the torture 
and extrajudicial killing of Víctor Jara. Barrientos is  
alleged to have been at Chile Stadium and to have  
been responsible for Jara’s torture and murder.  
The Court awarded a default judgment to the  
Jara family after Barrientos did not make a single  
appearance in the case against him.  In January 2015,  
Barrientos appeared in court for the first time to file 
a motion to set aside the default judgment. Knowing 
the importance of litigating these claims in court, in  
a fully defended case, CJA agreed with our clients 
to not oppose the motion and the court lifted the 
default judgment.  
“It has been tough to keep fighting for 40 years,” 
said Joan Jara, Víctor Jara’s widow, “but Víctor’s case  
is so important not just for us, but for all the families 
that are still suffering because of the brutality and 
the terrible crimes committed in those years.” CJA  
and pro bono co-counsel traveled to Chile in 2015  
to meet with eyewitnesses, experts, and our clients. 
The case will be brought to trial in Orlando, Florida  
on June 13, 2016.
“It has been tough to keep fighting 
for 40 years, but Víctor’s case  
is so important not just for us,  
but for all the families that are  
still suffering because of the  
brutality and the terrible crimes 
committed in those years.”7
COLOMBIA
LITIGATION
Narco-Trafficking and Attacks on Human Rights Defenders 
Cabrera v. Jimenez Naranjo
One of Colombia’s most violent paramilitary commanders, known as “Macaco,” confessed to the murder of  
4,000 civilians during the country’s long-running civil war. Yet, when he was extradited to the United States and 
sent to prison in 2008, it wasn’t for the heinous crimes under his command, but for drug trafficking charges.  
CJA is suing Macaco for torture, extrajudicial killing, crimes against humanity and war crimes so his victims can 
finally see justice served.
CJA brought the suit on behalf of the estates and surviving family members of Alma Rosa Jaramillo, a human 
rights lawyer, and Eduardo Estrada, a community activist, who were among those killed by forces under Macaco’s 
command. The court has dismissed claims by the Jaramillo family and we are evaluating next steps. The Estrada 
family’s claims are continuing, and we are currently in discovery.    
TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
Peace Accords and Accountability Strategies 
Colombia has endured the longest-running internal armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere, lasting over  
50 years.  In the last 20 years alone, an estimated 70,000 civilians have been killed in a triangulated war between 
guerrillas, paramilitaries and government forces. Peace accords between the government and the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia’s main and oldest guerrilla group, have yet to be finalized. CJA has 
been closely following the peace negotiations, which began in 2012, and has advised key civil society players on 
justice for the victims in the transitional justice process that should follow the signing of the peace accord. 
More recently, CJA has been invited to participate, along with local civil society partners, to help develop a  
strategy to pursue accountability for human rights violations committed during the armed conflict. It is hoped 
that this strategy will be part of a broader implementation of the transitional justice component of the peace  
accords in the years to come. 
 8EL SALVADOR
LITIGATION
Murder of Jesuit Priests and Civilians 
The Jesuits Massacre Case 
In November 16, 1989, the world awoke to horrifying news from San Salvador. The Salvadoran Army had  
entered the grounds of the Jesuit University of Central America and acted upon orders to kill Father Ignacio  
Ellacuria. Six Jesuit priests, a house keeper and her daughter were brutally murdered.  
In correlation with the 40th anniversary of this tragic event, CJA filed criminal charges in Spain against the  
former President of El Salvador and 14 former military personnel. The suit charged the former military members 
with state terrorism and crimes against humanity, and former President Alfredo Cristiani for aiding in the  
covering up of murders in cold blood. 
In 2011, the Spanish National Court issued indictments against all of the accused. All defendants resided in  
El Salvador and were protected by an amnesty law. All but one – Colonel Inocente Montano who lived outside 
Boston, Massachusetts, making a living as a candymaker.  The Spanish National Court ordered that Colonel 
Inocente Montano be extradited to stand trial. As a result of CJA’s advocacy, the U.S. government filed a request 
seeking Montano’s extradition for his role in the Jesuits Massacre. 
Reflecting on decades of seeking redress for the Salvadoran people, Almudena Bernabeu, CJA’s lead counsel  
on the Jesuits Massacre Case, said: “The extradition request for Col. Montano and the trial to follow will be the 
final effort to consolidate all that has been investigated and reported over the last 25 years - to unfold and  
reconstruct the story of the murders in a way that tells the complete truth and secures criminal accountability. 
This is simultaneously the beginning and the end of the hard work, tenacity, and hope of so many. We will be 
honored and humbled to have the opportunity to try such a historic case.”
9EL SALVADOR
DELEGATION 
CJA human rights delegation traveled to El Salvador in November 2014 to commemorate the 25th  
anniversary of the Jesuits Massacre.  The delegation met with El Salvador’s Vice President Óscar Ortiz with  
justices of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, and participated in events honoring the  
victims of the massacre. (L-R) Rev. William Wipfler, Nico van Aelstyn, Almudena Bernabeu, Jim Green, Camilo Artiga-Purcell, Peter Stern,

LITIGATION
Human Rights Violations during the Salvadoran Civil War 
U.S. Removal Proceedings Against Vides Casanova
As former defense minister of El Salvador, General Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova presided over the  
disappearance, killing, and torture of over 75,000 civilians during the Salvadoran Civil War. In 2002, CJA  
won a civil case against him and another former defense minister, General Jose Guillermo Garcia, holding  
him accountable for war crimes committed under their leadership. 
Since the landmark ruling that awarded $54.6 million in damages to our clients, General Cassanova has  
been removed from the United States because of CJA’s advocacy efforts. The Board of Immigration Appeals  
ruled in March 2015 that General Vides Casanova was removable from the United States due to his role in  
the torture and murder of Salvadoran citizens, establishing a precedent that a top-ranking foreign military  
commander can be deported based on human rights violations. 
As Vides Casanova arrived in El Salvador, he was met by families holding photos and stories of those  
who were tortured, killed, and disappeared under his command. We commend the courage, tenacity, and  
commitment of all our Salvadoran clients for testifying about their experiences.  10PERU

Civil War Atrocities:  
The Struggle for Accountability 
30th Anniversary of  
Accomarca Massacre
From 1980 to 2000, some 70,000 Peruvians,  
the majority of them indigenous, died in fighting 
between government forces and guerillas. Both 
sides of the civil war committed systematic  
human rights atrocities. The number of dead  
and disappeared surpasses the casualties of all 
other wars in modern Peruvian history.
On August 14, 1985, sixty-nine innocent men, 
women and children were lined up, herded into 
houses and repeatedly shot by the Peruvian army 
who raided their homes in the highland village 
of Accomarca.  The Accomarca Massacre marked  
the beginning of the military repression against 
civilians, specifically the indigenous population.
CJA and pro bono co-counsel Morgan Lewis  
and Bockius LLP filed cases against two of the  
commanders responsible for the Accormarca  
Massacre, Lieutenant Juan Rivera Rondón and  
Second Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado Hurtado, who 
had sought safe harbor in the United States.
Inspired by our clients, Teófila Ochoa and Cirila  
Pulido, who hope to see criminal accountability  
in their home country, CJA supported the develop -
ment of the criminal case in Peru and in the overall 
litigation strategy, which helped set the stage for 
the prosecution. 
CJA’s civil cases led to the extradition and deportation 
of the defendants to Peru and the beginning of a 
criminal trial that started in 2010. Without our cases 
in the United States and the subsequent removal of 
the key perpetrators of the Accormarca Massacre, 
the trial in Peru could not have gone forward.
Thirty years after the massacre, trial proceedings are 
finally over in Peru and we are waiting for a verdict.
11SOMALIA
ORAL ARGUMENTS
Mass Atrocities in  
Northern Somalia 
Warfaa v. Ali
As the head of the Somali army’s Fifth Brigade in  
the 1980s, Colonel Yusuf Abdi Ali (nicknamed 
“Tukeh”) terrorized the Isaaq clan in the northwest -
ern region of Somalia, known today as Somaliland. 
One of his victims, Farhan Warfaa, was nearly killed 
by Tukeh but miraculously survived. Decades later, 
CJA, on behalf of Warfaa, continues to fight to bring 
his torturer to justice in U.S. courts.
In September 2015, CJA and pro bono co-counsel 
DLA Piper presented oral argument to the U.S. Fourth 
Circuit Court of Appeals regarding CJA client Farhan 
Mohamoud Tani Warfaa’s case against Colonel Yusuf 
Abdi Ali (nicknamed “Tukeh”). Colonel Tukeh’s attorney 
sought to reverse more than three decades of legal 
precedent that had allowed victims of human rights 
abuses to bring lawsuits under the Alien Tort Statute 
(ATS) in U.S. courts against their tormentors - when 
they are found in this country – for mass atrocities 
such as war crimes and crimes against humanity com -
mitted abroad. He also claimed sovereign immunity 
under the common law.

War Crimes Committed  
Under Somali Dictator 
Yousuf v. Samantar
General Mohammed Ali Samantar, Somalia’s former 
prime minister and minister of defense, presided 
over the killings and torture of countless civilians 
in the 1980s under the brutal dictatorship of Siad 
Barré. In 2004, CJA filed a civil suit against Samantar 
on behalf of Somali survivors. Samantar, who has 
lived in the United States since 1997, was found  
liable for human rights atrocities and ordered to  
pay $21 million in damages to our clients.
After several attempts over the past decade to  
appeal his conviction and have the case dismissed, 
the U.S. Supreme Court declined certiorari over  
Samantar’s petition, making the $21 million  
judgment against him final. This ensured that no 
court would overturn his liability for actions by  
subordinates in the Somali armed forces who  
committed torture, crimes against humanity, war 
crimes, and other human rights abuses in violation 
of international law during the Barré dictatorship. 
“I truly rejoice to know that Samantar cannot 
escape the pronouncement of the court of law,”  
said CJA client Aziz Deria. “My late father, Mohamed 
Iid; my younger brother, Mustafa; and my cousin, 
Yusuf, were pulled from our family’s home and 
murdered under General Samantar’s orders just 
because of their clan. The Supreme Court’s decision 
today gives me hope that justice for all Somalis  
is possible.”
“I truly rejoice 
to know that Samantar 
cannot escape the

court of law.”12SOMALILAND
TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE 
Seeking Justice through  
Forensic Evidence
After more than 10 years of CJA’s involvement in 
seeking accountability and redress for the victims 
of Somali dictator Siad Barré, the Minister of Justice 
of the Republic of Somaliland requested our assis -
tance in formulating a transitional justice plan for 
the country as the region emerged from civil war 
and massive human rights violations.  
CJA continues to partner with the Somaliland War 
Crimes Investigation Commission and the Peruvian 
Forensic Anthropology Team (EPAF) to support 
ongoing forensic training in Somaliland. CJA is 
presently assisting EPAF’s efforts to identify victims 
from a set of mass graves at a former military base 
known as Lag Barako. Exhumations commenced 
in March 2015.  These graves are associated with 
one of our defendants, Col. Tukeh, since they are 
believed to contain the remains of people killed in 
public mass executions he ordered.  
In March 2015, CJA travelled to Somaliland to  
facilitate communications with family members  
of those believed to be buried at the site.  
Also in March 2015, Somaliland President Ahmed 
Mohamed Mahamoud Silanyo presented CJA  
with the Special Presidential Commendation for 
the organization’s extraordinary commitment  
to human rights and outstanding achievements 
on behalf of victims and survivors of grave human 
rights violations committed under the Siad  
Barré dictatorship.

SRI LANKA
TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE 
Holding Perpetrators Accountable for Civil War Crimes 
CJA continues to support accountability efforts for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in  
Sri Lanka during the final months of the 26-year civil war, which ended in May 2009, leaving upwards of  
40,000 civilians dead during the final months alone.  
CJA supported the U.N.’s OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL), whose findings were published in September 
2015, through several projects. CJA traveled to Bangkok, Thailand, in July 2015 to map out accountability options 
following the release of the report. Civil society organizations in Sri Lanka shared their proposals for a hybrid 
accountability mechanism, a truth-seeking process, and a unit for tracing the disappeared, each with significant 
international oversight and technical assistance. 
After the release of the OISL report in September 2015, CJA organized and moderated a congressional briefing 
before the Senate Human Rights Caucus and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. The briefing, entitled 
Sri Lanka: The Path Forward for Accountability, Peace, and Reconciliation, discussed findings from the OISL  
report and explored new strategies for the U.S. to support transitional justice in Sri Lanka. CJA also organized  
a teleconference briefing which connected Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff with leading advocates  
for Sri Lankan civil society. 
14UNITED STATES
U.S. Advocacy
CJA has played a lead role in identifying gaps in U.S. civil and criminal law that let the worst international  
human rights criminals slip through the cracks. Working with policymakers and civil society groups, CJA  
crafts and supports policies that ensure the effective prosecution of atrocity crimes, deny safe haven to their 
perpetrators, and protect and rehabilitate their victims.
This year, CJA convened a Mass Atrocities Working Group (MAWG) to identify gaps in U.S. law for the prosecution 
of human rights crimes.  The MAWG included leading thinkers and litigators who supported the 2009–2010  
effort to enact a Crimes Against Humanity Act, which would have made this core international crime a federal 
offense. The MAWG identified numerous loopholes in the U.S. penal code which limit the federal government’s 
ability to hold perpetrators accountable, even when they are found in U.S. territory or custody.  
The Working Group concluded that the most critical loopholes in U.S. legislation are the lack of codified  
definitions of human rights crimes, which make them difficult to prosecute. Areas of particular concern include 
a need for a crimes-against-humanity statute, the lack of a codified definition of command responsibility, the 
limited jurisdictional reach of the War Crimes Act, and the inability of the Torture Act to apply to non-state actors. 
Through model legislation and educational efforts, CJA is leading a campaign to close these gaps and ensure 
that the U.S. legal system is effective in the fight to end impunity for mass atrocities.
