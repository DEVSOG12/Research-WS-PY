Earlier this year, the Spirit Lake Nation, the
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the individual plain-tiffs, and the North Dakota Secretary of State inBrakebill, et. al v. Jaeger and Spirit Lake et. al v.Jaeger announced an agreement to settle the two
federal cases and address issues related to usingtribal IDs for voting in North Dakota. The partiesare working together to ensure that NativeAmericans who are qualified electors will be ableto vote in 2020 and beyond.
“This fight has been ongoing for over four years,
and we are delighted to come to an agreementthat protects Native voters,” said NativeAmerican Rights Fund (NARF) Staff AttorneyMatthew Campbell, who represented plaintiffs inboth cases.  “It has always been our goal toensure that every Native person in North Dakotahas an equal opportunity to vote, and we haveachieved that today.”
Not Able to Vote
In 2014, veteran and Turtle Mountain Band ofChippewa Indians member Elvis Norquay wentto his local polling station to vote as usual.Unlike years past, that year Mr. Norquay wasturned away from the polls and not allowed tovote. The reason given was that he did not havean ID that met the state’s new restrictive specifications. The law required voters to presentidentification listing their residential streetaddress. Like many of his neighbors in the Turtle Mountain community, Mr. Norquay didnot have that.
The new street address requirement was a sub-
stantial hurdle for many Native Americansbecause North Dakota has a broken addressingsystem. The state had failed to assign residential
street addresses to many tribal reservationhomes. Many Native Americans living on reser-vations do not have or do not know their residen-tial addresses. Tribal citizens often must use POBoxes to conduct their affairs. Therefore, theyare more likely to have an ID that lists a PO Boxrather than the residential address that wasrequired by the North Dakota voter ID law. 
Also, the unique burdens faced by Native

the US Court of Appeals in September 2018.Americans in North Dakota—including a severe
housing shortage—also mean that tribal mem-bers are much more likely to have recentlymoved or be homeless or precariously housed. As a result, determining members’ residentialaddresses and providing them with up-to-datedocumentation can require the investment oftime and resources.
The state legislature knew this was the case. They
knew that their voting ID law would dispropor-tionately affect Native voters, but they still passedthe law. In response, in January 2016, eightNative Americans, represented by NARF , TomDickson, and Rich de Bodo filed suit to block thediscriminatory law. 
Judge Daniel L. Hovland of the US District Court
for the District of North Dakota held that the lawlikely violated the US Constitution because it disproportionately kept Native Americans fromvoting. He required the state provide a fail-safemechanism in the 2016 general election for thosewithout IDs. Hovland wrote, “…it is clear that asafety net is needed for those voters who simplycannot obtain a qualifying voter ID with reason-
able effort.”
In light of this defeat, the state legislature amended
their voter ID law in early 2017, but the new lawfailed to include meaningful protections for voters’rights. The new law continued to put North Dakotabeyond the norms of voter ID laws and violated theconstitutional rights of the state’s citizens. Just likeNorth Dakota’s previous law, this law made it hard-er for some citizens—specifically Native Americancitizens—to exercise their right to vote. 
On October 30, 2018, NARF along with the
Campaign Legal Center, Robins Kaplan LLP , andCohen Milstein Sellers and Toll PLLC filed a sep-arate lawsuit on behalf of the Spirit Lake Nationand six individual plaintiffs to ensure that eligibleNative American voters residing on reservationsin North Dakota would be able to cast a ballot inthe 2018 midterm elections and in all future elections. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, withapproximately 5,868 residents of voting-age thatcould be affected by the law, joined the SpiritLake case in early 2019.

VOLUME 45, NO. 1 PAGE 3NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDDespite a nationwide outcry during the 2018
election cycle, North Dakota’s discriminatoryvoter ID law remained on the books. During the2018 election, the Spirit Lake Nation and theStanding Rock Sioux tribe expended substantialresources to ensure that their tribal memberswould have the identification necessary to vote,including shouldering the task of identifying andproviding residential street addresses for theirmembers.
Fixing the System
Finally, in early 2020 and with a trial date looming,the North Dakota Secretary of State agreed to settle the two lawsuits. At an in-person mediationat the North Dakota capitol, the Secretary agreedto take steps to ensure that eligible NativeAmerican voters are not disenfranchised due tothe restrictive voter ID law.
In addition to recognizing tribal IDs and supple-
mental documentation issued to tribal citizens,the Secretary agreed to enter into a binding consent decree, enforced by a federal court order.That decree will ensure that Native American voters who do not have or do not know their res-idential street address are able to vote. TheSecretary of State agreed to work with theDepartment of Transportation and tribal govern-ments to distribute free, non-driver, photo IDs on every reservation statewide within 30 days offuture statewide elections.
Importantly, in the 2020 election, Native
American voters will have the option to marktheir residence on a map, a process that is com-monly used by voters in other states. The burdenwill then shift to the state to verify the residentialstreet addresses for these voters, to provide thatinformation to the voter and the tribe, and toensure those voters’ ballots are counted.
Finally, the court-ordered consent decree will
include details about what the state must do toeducate the public and train poll workers on thenew procedures, as well as measures to ensurethe state is complying with its obligations underthe agreement.These actions will help ensure that Native
American voters living in North Dakota will have their voices heard. Also, the steps that North Dakota is taking today can serve as anexample for the rest of the country going forwardas we all work to ensure that all eligible votershave equal access to the polls and our democracy.Voting should never be contingent on criterialike home ownership, access to government services, or income.

This March, the Native American Rights Fund,
American Civil Liberties Union, and ACLU ofMontana challenged a Montana law that severelyrestricts Native Americans’ access to the ballot.
The lawsuit was brought on behalf of the
Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck, BlackfeetNation, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes ofthe Flathead Reservation, Crow Tribe, and FortBelknap Indian Community as well as WesternNative Voice and Montana Native Vote (NativeAmerican-led organizations focused on getting outthe vote and increasing civic participation in NativeAmerican communities). They are challenging theso-called Montana Ballot Interference PreventionACT (BIPA).
Voting has never been easy for Native Americans
living on rural reservations, which are often geo-graphically isolated, with limited access to postalservice and transportation.
“BIPA ignores the everyday realities that face
Native American communities. It is not reasonableto expect voters to drive an hour to drop off theirballot, so collecting ballots in reservation commu-nities just makes sense. Criminalizing this behav-ior is unfair to Native American voters and doesnothing to solve the real problem of mail not beingpicked up and delivered to Native homes,” saidNARF Staff Attorney Jacqueline De León.
In a state where the majority of individuals vote by
mail, rural tribal communities work with get-out-the-vote organizers who collect and transport ballots to election offices that would otherwise beinaccessible. These ballot collection efforts areoften the only way Native Americans can access thevote. BIPA would effectively end this practice, disenfranchising Native American voters en masse.For example:
 BIPA imposes severe restrictions on who can col-
lect ballots and how many ballots can be collected.Get-out-the-vote organizers would previouslycollect up to 100 ballots each, but are now
restricted to just six ballots per collector.
 Under BIPA, bringing ballots to the post office for
relatives or neighbors could result in a $500 fineper ballot.
 Compliance with BIPA is complicated by unclear
definitions about who exactly can collect a ballot.Organizers may or may not fit into its provisions,depending on which interpretation law enforce-ment officials adopt.
 BIPA’s provisions are incompatible with Native
family structures and relationships. BIPA definesa “family member” as “an individual who is relatedto the voter by blood, marriage, adoption, or legalguardianship.” But that definition does notreflect family relationships in tribal communi-ties, where family includes members of theextended community.
Western Native Voice and Montana Native Vote
work to promote civic participation in the NativeAmerican community. On average, they collectover 85 ballots per organizer, which has been criti-cal to ensuring people on reservations can exercisetheir fundamental right to vote. Under BIPA, how-ever, Western Native Voice and Montana NativeVote would be able to assist a mere fraction of thevoters it assisted in 2018.Montana Tribes and Native Orgs File Suit to Protect Voters

“A main tenet of our organization’s principles is to
encourage civic engagement,” said Marci McLean,executive director of Western Native Voice. “Wedeveloped a robust get-out-the-vote program andcoupled it with an official ballot collection pro-gram. We have organizers on every reservation inthe state, and in urban areas. For Native voters living on a reservation, this law directly harms ourability to participate in our democracy.”
The complaint charges BIPA with violating the voting and due process rights of individuals living
on reservations, as well as the free speech and asso-ciation rights of Western Native Voice and MontanaNative Vote as they engage in ballot collection onreservations.
The lawsuit, Western Native Voice v. Stapleton , was
filed in the Montana 13th Judicial District Court inYellowstone County. Complaint available athttps://www.narf.org/nill/documents/20200312complaint_wnv_v_stapleton.pdf
Congratulations to our long-time client, the Little
Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana who,after more than a hundred years of battling thefederal government for recognition, were finallylegislatively recognized by Congress.
The Little Shell Tribe has waged a two-front war to
obtain recognition—one front in Congress andone in the administrative process.  For decades,NARF has represented the Tribe in the administra-tive process and gathered crucial information usedin the Congressional effort, which was led by JoshClause (Clause Law P .L.L.C.). The two efforts com-plemented each other, and we are thrilled that wewere able to support the Tribe’s ultimate success.
In 1978, the Department of the Interior estab-
lished regulations governing the federal recogni-tion of Indian tribes. The Little Shell Tribe sent aletter in 1978 indicating an intent to proceedunder the regulations. The process required exten-sive historical, genealogical, and anthropologicalevidence of a tribe’s continuous existence as a gov-erning body over time. Little Shell submitted over60,000 pages of documentation in support of itsrecognition. NARF represented the tribe through-out these years’ of effort. Thousands of attorneyhours were invested in fulfilling the regulationsand experts were hired to collect and confirm therequired anthropological evidence.With the collected evidence in-hand, the Tribe
received a favorable preliminary finding in supportof its federal recognition. However, subsequently,that finding was reversed—even though noadverse evidence had been presented. To accom-modate a convoluted and broken administrativeprocess, extensive revisions were made to therecognition regulations. The Tribe has beenworking to resubmit under the new regulations.
Thankfully, given the recent Congressional action,
that effort is no longer necessary. NARF congratu-lates the Tribe on its success and thanks them for theopportunity to serve them for these many decades.

PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI
GRANTED
The Court has granted review in two Indian law
cases that have not been decided by the Court:
MCGIRT V. OKLAHOMA (18-9526)
Petitioner: Jimcy McGirt
Petition Granted: December 13, 2019
Subject Matter: Reservation Disestablishment
Lower Court Decision: The Oklahoma Court of
Criminal Appeals affirmed a lower court’s denialof Mr. McGirt’s post-conviction relief petition.
Recent Activity: Respondent’s brief filed
Upcoming Activity: Oral argument scheduled
for April 21, 2020, was postponed due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. The Court announcedargument will take place telephonically on May11, 2020. Petitioner Jimcy McGirt, a citizen of Seminole
Nation and Muscogee (Creek) Nation, was convictedof several felony sex crimes in Oklahoma statecourt. He sought post-conviction relief in statecourt, asserting that the crimes occurred withinthe boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek)Reservation and, therefore, the State had no juris-diction over him for the offenses. The state districtcourt denied his petition, and the Oklahoma Courtof Criminal Appeals affirmed.
SHARP V. MURPHY (17-1107)
Petitioner: State of Oklahoma 
Petition Granted: May 21, 2018 
Subject Matter: Reservation Disestablishment 
Lower Court Decision: On a petition challeng-
ing his detention by the State of Oklahoma asimproper, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appealsheld that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reserva-tion was not disestablished and, consequently,that the State of Oklahoma lacked jurisdictionto prosecute and convict Mr. Murphy, anIndian, for a crime that occurred in Indiancountry.  
Recent Activity: Argument held November 27,
2018. Re-argument was ordered in June 2019. 
Upcoming Activity: Re-argument (no date set)

Nation, was convicted of murder in Oklahoma

State court. After exhausting his appeals, he filed a
habeas corpus petition in federal district courtasserting that, because the crime occurred withinthe Muscogee (Creek) Nation’s reservation bound-aries and because he is Indian, the state court hadno jurisdiction. The federal district court deniedhis petition and the Tenth Circuit reversed.  TheTenth Circuit used the three-factor Solem reserva-tion disestablishment analysis and found thatCongress did not disestablish the reservation, andthat statutes and allotment agreements showedthat “Congress recognized the existence of theCreek Nation’s borders.” Likewise, the court heldthat the historical evidence indicated neither aCongressional intent to disestablish the reserva-tion, nor a contemporaneous understanding byCongress that it had disestablished the reservation.Accordingly, the court concluded that Mr. Murphy’sstate conviction and death sentence were invalidbecause the crime occurred in Indian Country and
the accused was Indian.  
The Supreme Court heard oral argument on
November 27, 2018, and, on December 4, 2018, itordered supplemental briefing by the parties, theSolicitor General, and the Muscogee (Creek)Nation addressing two questions: (1) whether anystatute grants the state of Oklahoma jurisdictionover the prosecution of crimes committed byIndians in the area within the 1866 territorialboundaries of the Creek Nation, irrespective of thearea’s reservation status, and (2) whether there arecircumstances in which land qualifies as an Indianreservation but nonetheless does not meet the def-inition of Indian country as set forth in 18 U.S.C.§1151(a). On June 27, 2019, the Court announcedthat the case would be scheduled for re-argumentin the October Term 2019, but no date has been set.

and largest nonprofit legal organization defending andpromoting the legal rights of Indian people on issuesessential to their tribal sovereignty, natural resources, andhuman rights. 
Since 1970, we have provided legal advice and representa-
tion to Native American tribes and organizations on issuesof major importance. Our early work was instrumental inestablishing the field of Indian law. NARF—when very fewwould—steadfastly took stands for Indian religious freedom and sacred places, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, as well as basic human and civil rights. Wecontinue to take on complex, time-consuming cases thatothers avoid, such as government accountability, climatechange, and the education of our children. We have assistedmore than 300 tribal nations with critical issues that go tothe heart of who we are as sovereign nations.
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of
Directors was to develop priorities to guide the organiza-tion in its mission to preserve and enforce the legal rightsof Native Americans. The committee developed five prior-ities that continue to lead NARF today:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian
rights, laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF
works to construct the foundations that empower tribesto live according to their traditions, enforce their treatyrights, insure their independence on reservations, andprotect their sovereignty. An adequate land base and control over natural resources
are central components of economic self-sufficiency andself-determination, and are vital to the very existence oftribes. Thus, much of NARF’s work involves protecting
tribal natural resources . 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal
and inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face theongoing threat of having their rights undermined by theUnited States government, states, and others who seek tolimit these rights. Under the priority of promoting
human rights , NARF strives to enforce and strengthen
laws that protect the rights of Native Americans to prac-tice their traditional religion, use their languages, andenjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between
the United States and Indian nations is the inherent dutyfor all levels of government to recognize and responsiblyenforce the laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. Because such laws impact virtually every aspectof tribal life, NARF is committed to holding governments
accountable to Native Americans.
Developing Indian law and educating the public about
Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential for the con-
tinued protection of Indian rights. This primarily involvesestablishing favorable court precedents, distributinginformation and law materials, encouraging and fosteringIndian legal education, and forming alliances with Indianlaw practitioners and other Indian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to
NARF's main office at 1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302.NARF’s clients are expected to pay what they can towardthe costs of legal representation.
