“The State has acknowledged that Native
American communities often lack residentialstreet addresses . . . Nevertheless, under cur-
rent State law an individual who does nothave a ‘current residential street address’will never be qualified to vote. This is a clear
‘legal obstacle’ inhibiting the opportunity tovote.” (emphasis in original)
- Judge Daniel L. Hovland, Order Granting
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Second PreliminaryInjunction in Part (April 3, 2018)
On December 13, 2017, the Native American
Rights Fund (NARF) again brought action, in thecase Brakebill, et al. v. Jaeger , on behalf of Native
American plaintiffs impacted by the state of NorthDakota’s discriminatory voter identification (ID)law. On April 3, 2018, plaintiffs achieved a sub-stantial victory when Judge Daniel L. Hovland ofthe U.S. District Court of North Dakota issued anorder that significantly barred the enforcement ofNorth Dakota’s recently passed voter ID law(House Bill 1369) because of its discriminatoryeffects on Native Americans. The State of NorthDakota immediately appealed to the 8th Circuitto keep its disenfranchising law in effect for theupcoming 2018 election. 
NARF will continue to fight against these uncon-
stitutional laws that insult the very fiber of ourdemocracy. The government should not createunnecessary obstacles for qualified citizens tovote. And we, as a nation, must fight to ensurethat every American, every Native American, isgiven the opportunity to vote in every election.The right to vote is a fundamental right in any
democracy, and NARF is committed to ensuringthat our democratic values are protected.
About the North Dakota Voter ID Law
North Dakota has had a voter ID law since 2004.For years, the law functioned without issue.During that time, the law required voters to showidentification, but allowed a voter without ID tocast a ballot if either: a poll worker could vouch for the voter’s identity
as a qualified voter; or
 the voter signed an affidavit under penalty of
perjury that he or she was qualified to vote.

“Discriminatory and Burdensome Impact on Native Americans”This system worked especially well in small reser-
vation communities where poll workers werefamiliar with voters. In 2013, following the sur-prise election of Democrat Heidi Heitkamp to theU.S. Senate the year before, the North Dakota leg-islature greatly narrowed the law by restrictingthe acceptable forms of ID and eliminating thevoucher and affidavit fail-safes. The following ses-sion, the legislature amended the law again toeven further restrict the forms of acceptable ID.
In making the changes, the legislature cited the
need to eliminate voter fraud, but illegal votinghas never been a problem in the state. In fact,Secretary of State Alvin Jaeger declared in a 2006letter, “[D]uring my fourteen years as Secretary ofState and the state’s chief election officer, myoffice has not referred any cases of voter fraud tothe United States Attorney, the North DakotaAttorney General, or to local prosecutors. Wehaven’t had any to refer.”
In January 2016, eight Native Americans repre-
sented by the Native American Rights Fund filedsuit to block the North Dakota voter ID law, alleg-ing that it disenfranchised Native American votersand violated both state and federal constitutionsas well as the Voting Rights Act.
How did the voter ID law disenfranchise Native
American voters?At the time of the 2016 lawsuit, the North Dakotavoter ID law required one of four forms of ID andrequired that they contain name, residentialaddress, and date of birth. The state claimed thattribal IDs qualified under its law, but most tribalIDs do not have a residential address printed onthem. This is due, in part, to the fact that formany years reservation housing did not haveaddresses; to this day the U.S. Postal Service doesnot provide residential delivery in some ruralIndian communities, causing most tribal mem-bers to use a Post Office Box. If a tribal ID has anaddress, it typically is the PO Box address, whichdid not satisfy North Dakota’s restrictive voter IDlaw. In the 2014 elections, many qualified NorthDakota tribal electors went to vote with a tribalID, which they believed would be sufficient forvoting, but were turned away at the polls.“As a veteran who served this country, I know how
important it is to vote,” explained plaintiff RichardBrakebill. “But I wasn’t permitted to vote in 2014because my address wasn’t listed on my ID. Thatwas very upsetting.” Elvis Norquay, another plain-tiff who is a veteran added, “I felt bad about beingturned away from the polls at the last election. It is my right to vote for whomever I want. I shouldn’t be turned away just because I didn’thave my address listed.”
Native Americans are more than twice as likely as
non-Native Americans to lack a qualifying ID.Long distances, lack of transportation, and limit-ed operating hours at licensing centers closest toNative American populations make it more bur-densome for Native Americans to obtain a state-issued ID. The required fees are more difficult forNative Americans because of economic dispari-ties. According to one study, more than 72,000voting-eligible North Dakota citizens lack a quali-fying ID. (That is in a total population around750,000).

buy alcohol or cigarettes miss a crucial point.Voting is a fundamental, constitutionally protect-ed right. In order for the government to burdenthat fundamental right, it needs to demonstrate acompelling reason. Here, the Secretary of Stateand the legislature have done a lot of speculation,but haven’t demonstrated why it’s necessary totake action that disenfranchises Native Americanvoters,” observed NARF Staff Attorney MatthewCampbell, lead attorney on the case.
What was the outcome of the 2016 case?
Before the November 2016 election, JudgeHovland of the U.S. District Court, ND, found thelaw violated the U.S. Constitution. He wrote, “it isclear that a safety net is needed for those voterswho simply cannot obtain a qualifying voter IDwith reasonable effort.” Accordingly, the courtrequired North Dakota to provide a fail-safe andpermit voters without a qualifying ID to vote ifthey signed an affidavit swearing to their qualifi-cations for the 2016 general election.
In light of this defeat, the North Dakota legisla-
ture amended their law in early 2017, purportingto cure its defects. However, the new law kept theparts of the law that disenfranchised NativeAmericans. Some legislators supporting this newvoter ID bill have described it as a way to cure theproblems identified by the federal court. H.B.1369, however, did not contain any fail-safe mech-anisms like the one required by the court. Thenewly minted law completely ignored JudgeHovland’s directive to provide a safety net for vot-ers. H.B. 1369 allowed provisional balloting, but itrequired each voter to present a qualifying ID toan election official within six days in order for thevote to be counted. In this way, the law made anallowance for voters who left their IDs at home,but it did not address the problem of voters who,although qualified to vote, could not obtain one ofthe narrow set of permitted IDs. Those qualifiedelectors were not allowed to vote. 
“The North Dakota legislature had an opportuni-
ty to address the real problem with voting in thestate—voter disenfranchisement. Instead, it con-tinues to chase the ghosts of illegal voters, animagined problem that doesn’t really exist. In thecourse of litigation and in the three consecutive leg-
islative sessions where voting bills have been con-sidered, there has simply been no demonstrationthat people are casting illegal ballots,” said NARFStaff Attorney Joel West Williams at the time.
“The Court recognized that without a safety net,
this law disenfranchises voters,” Campbell added,“and eliminating the votes of poor and minorityvoters does not ensure election integrity. TheNorth Dakota Legislature’s continued failure toprovide any safety net in the face of the Court’sOrder is astounding. ”
Native American plaintiffs sue North 
Dakota - againOn December 13, 2017, the Native AmericanRights Fund again brought action against thestate of North Dakota seeking to overturn NorthDakota’s newest discriminatory voter ID law.Plaintiffs Richard Brakebill, Dorothy Herman,Della Merrick, Elvis Norquay, Ray Norquay, andLucille Vivier amended their suit to challenge themost recently enacted voter ID law. 
The legislature passed these provisions despite
knowing they would suppress the NativeAmerican vote. The law was implemented in orderto deny qualified Native American voters access tothe ballot box. As Campbell explains, “voting is afundamental, constitutionally protected right,and we intend to protect that right. The NorthDakota legislature was fully aware the impact thislaw would have on the Native population in NorthDakota. Yet, they passed the law anyway.” 
Fighting voter suppression has never been more
timely or important. North Dakota recentlyreduced the hours of the Driver’s License Site(where state voter IDs are issued) closest to theplaintiffs. That location now operates the mostrestrictive hours of any in the state— it is open for
less than five hours one day each month. There is
not a single Driver’s License Site on an Indianreservation in North Dakota. Native Americans onthe Lake Traverse Reservation, Fort BertholdReservation, and Standing Rock Reservationshave to travel an average of almost an hour just toaccess a Driver’s License Site, some of which areopen for very limited hours.On April 3, 2018, plaintiffs
achieved a substantial victorywhen Judge Daniel L. Hovland ofthe U.S. District Court of NorthDakota again barred the enforce-ment of North Dakota’s recentlypassed voter ID. Judge Hovlandfound that the “public interest inprotecting the most cherishedright to vote for thousands ofNative Americans who currentlylack a qualifying ID and cannotobtain one outweighs the pur-ported interest and arguments ofthe State.” Thus, Judge Hovlandprohibited enforcement of thediscriminatory law. Additionally,the order allows PO Box address-es—prevalent in Native Americancommunities—to be used toprove residency, and dramaticallyexpands the types of ID availableto voters at the polls to includeany document, letter, writing,enrollment card, or other form of tribal identifica-tion issued by a tribal authority to be used in lieuof ID cards, until final resolution of the case.
According to NARF Voting Rights Fellow
Jacqueline De León, one of the attorneys repre-senting the plaintiffs in the case, “Judge Hovlandgot it. He detailed the unfair nature of the state’slaw and again recognized that the law created sig-nificant and unnecessary voting obstacles forNative voters in North Dakota. Laws such as theseare a direct threat to the functioning of ourdemocracy.”
Importantly, Judge Hovland’s order also expands
the valid forms of voter identification to includedocuments issued by tribal governments, theBureau of Indian Affairs, and other tribal agen-cies. “This distinction is significant becauseputting that control back in the hands of tribalorganizations allows tribal governments to ensurethat their citizens do not continue to be disen-franchised,” explains Campbell.
With this order, Judge Hovland has prevented the
discriminatory voter ID law from disenfranchisingNative voters in significant part until final deter-
mination is made in the matter. As Judge Hovlandexplains in his order, “common sense and a senseof fairness can easily remedy the above-identifiedproblems to ensure that all residents of NorthDakota, including the homeless as well as thosewho live on the reservations, will have an equaland meaningful opportunity to vote.”
The state continues to show its commitment to
disenfranchising Native American voters byimmediately appealing Judge Hovland’s mostrecent order to the 8th Circuit. On May 29, 2018,the parties to the case met for settlement negoti-ations, but no agreement was reached. This fightcontinues in the 8th Circuit, where NARF is pre-pared to defend the right of every North DakotanNative American to vote. 
The plaintiffs are represented by the Native
American Rights Fund, Richard de Bodo ofMorgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP , and Tom Dicksonof the Dickson Law Office.

America and Sandor Iron Rope v. TransportationSecurity Administration , et al.; Case 5:17-cv-
00108-OLG; In the United States District Courtfor the Western District of Texas, San AntonioDivision.
Lead counsel Forrest Tahdooahnippah (DW),
NARF Staff Attorney Steven Moore, and RayTorgerson (PH) filed the lawsuit on February 14,2017, in San Antonio federal court assertingReligious Freedom Restoration Act and federalcivil rights violations.  Following several meet-ings and conference calls to discuss and informal-ly resolve the matter, a settlement agreementwith the Transportation Security Administration(TSA) finally proved successful.
The lawsuit alleged that Mr. Iron Rope, the
immediate past president of Native AmericanChurch of North America (NACNA), was harassedby TSA agents at the San Antonio airport whilepassing through security. Iron Rope was return-ing home to South Dakota after a conferencenear the peyote gardens located in South Texas.Ignoring his pleas, the TSA agents mistreatedseveral sacred items in Iron Rope’s possession.As part of the settlement agreement, TSA willpublish a Job Aid for internal education and a“Know Before You Go” fact sheet to educateabout Native American religious items and createa less intrusive method for inspecting thoseitems. TSA Passenger Support Specialists (“PSS”)and Transportation Security Managers (“TSM”) atthe following airports will be directed to reviewthe Job Aid:    Denver, Colorado (DEN); Phoenix,Arizona (PHX); Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP);Omaha, Nebraska (OMA); and Oklahoma City,Oklahoma (OKC). TSA also agreed, with advancenotice, to provide the Job Aid materials to otherairport personnel through which NACNA members carrying religious items plan to travel.
Additionally, the parties will collaborate on pro-
ducing an educational webinar in the nearfuture.  PSSs and TSMs at the following airportsare required to view the webinar:  Albuquerque,New Mexico (ABQ); Durango, Colorado (DRO);Farmington, New Mexico (FMN); Great Falls,Montana (GTF); Laredo, Texas (LRD); McAllen,Texas (MFE); Minot, North Dakota (MOT); RapidCity, South Dakota (RAP); Sioux Falls, SouthDakota (FSD); and San Antonio, Texas (SAT).
TSA committed to training new or promoted
PSSs and TSMs on these matters for four years.In addition, the materials will also be generallyavailable to all TSA employees.  Finally, NACNA isinvited to join the TSA’s Multicultural BranchCoalition and participate in future conferences,meetings, and events.
Plaintiffs and their counsel believe that this set-
tlement lays critical groundwork for improvededucation, increased sensitivity, and better work-ing relationships between the TSA and NativeAmericans traveling with sacred items.TSA to Improve Handling of Native American

Indian Law Cases Decided By the Supreme Court
Patchak v. Zinke (16-498) – The Supreme Court
affirmed the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia and held that the Gun LakeTrust Reaffirmation Act of 2014 did not violateArticle III of the U.S. Constitution. 
This lawsuit was brought by David Patchak, a
non-Indian landowner, who successfully arguedbefore the Supreme Court in 2012 ( Patchak I)
that he had prudential standing to bring an APAaction and a Carcieri challenge to the acquisition
of trust land for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians/Gun Lake Tribe. Subsequently, while summaryjudgement briefing was underway before the dis-trict court on remand, Congress passed the GunLake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act of 2014 (theGun Lake Act), which reaffirmed the Departmentof the Interior’s decision to take the land in ques-tion into trust for the Tribe, and removed juris-diction from the federal courts over any actionsrelating to that property. Mr. Patchak challengedthe Gun Lake Act as an unconstitutional infringe-ment by Congress on the judicial power thatArticle III of the U.S. Constitution vests exclu-sively in the judiciary. The district court issuedsummary judgement for the United States andthe court of appeals affirmed. In a plurality opinion written by Justice Thomas
(and joined by Justices Breyer, Alito, and Kagan),the Supreme Court held that the Gun Lake Actdid not violate the separation of powers. TheCourt explained that while Congress may notexercise judicial power, it may make laws thatapply retroactively to pending lawsuits, evenwhen that legislation ensures that one side willwin. The dividing line is that Congress actsimpermissibly when it “compel[s] . . . findings orresults under old law,” while it acts permissiblywhen it simply “changes the law.” The Court thenexplained that Congress has authority to changethe law to withdraw the jurisdiction of federalcourts by enacting a “jurisdiction-strippingstatute,” and it may do so with regard to a specificclass of cases. The Court concluded that Congresshad enacted such a jurisdiction-stripping provi-sion in § 2(b) of the Gun Lake Act, which requiresany lawsuit “relating to” the specific tract ofproperty at issue in this case “shall be promptlydismissed.” 
Three Justices authored concurring opinions.
Justice Breyer’s concurrence emphasized thebroader context prompting passage of the GunLake Act and that in § 2(a) Congress reaffirmed,ratified, and confirmed the Secretary of theInterior’s actions in taking the Tribe’s land intotrust. Thus, Justice Breyer concluded, Congress“used its jurisdictional power to supplement,without altering, action that no one has chal-lenged as unconstitutional.” The concurringopinions of Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayoragreed that the decision of the court of appealsshould be affirmed, but on the grounds that theGun Lake Act restored the federal government’s sov-ereign immunity, thus barring Mr. Patchak’s suit.

VOLUME 43, NO. 1 PAGE 7NATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDChief Justice Roberts authored a dissenting opin-
ion, which was joined by Justices Kennedy andGorsuch. The dissent would have found the GunLake Act unconstitutional on the grounds that it“dictates the disposition of a single pending case”– authority they contend is vested solely in thejudiciary.

Upper Skagit Indian Tribe v. Lundgren (17-387) –
The Supreme Court reversed and remanded thecase to the Washington Supreme Court. In amajority opinion authored by Justice Gorsuch,the Court held that the Washington SupremeCourt erred when it relied on County of Yakima
v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of YakimaNation , 502 U.S. 251 (1992), for the proposition
that Tribes lack sovereign immunity in an in rem
action. Justice Gorsuch wrote: “Yakima did notaddress the scope of tribal sovereign immunity.Instead, it involved only a much more prosaicquestion of statutory interpretation concerningthe Indian General Allotment Act of 1887.”However, the Lundgrens also advanced a newargument at the U.S. Supreme Court, assertingthat at common law, sovereigns enjoyed noimmunity from actions involving immovableproperty located in the territory of another sover-eign. The majority pointed out that this line ofargument “appeared only when the United Statesfiled an amicus brief in this case—after briefingon certiorari, after the Tribe filed its openingbrief, and after the Tribe’s other amici had theirsay.” Accordingly, the Court remanded to theWashington Supreme Court to decide this issuein the first instance. 
Chief Justice Roberts filed a concurring opinion,
joined by Justice Kennedy, which expressed con-cern over a property owner’s lack of a remedy ina case such as this. “I do not object to the Court’sdetermination to forgo consideration of theimmovable-property rule at this time. But if itturns out that the rule does not extend to tribalassertions of rights in non-trust, non-reservationproperty, the applicability of sovereign immunityin such circumstances would, in my view, need tobe addressed in a future case.”Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined
by Justice Alito. The dissent argues that the caseshould not be remanded because the immovableproperty exception is a “predicate to an intelli-gent resolution of the question presented,” whichthe Court is obliged to resolve. The dissent thenexplains why, in its view, the immovable propertyexception should bar the Tribe from assertingsovereign immunity in this case.

Petitions for a Writ of Certiorari Granted
Royal, et al. v. Murphy (17-1107) – On May 21,
2018, the Court granted a petition filed by theState of Oklahoma seeking review of a U.S. TenthCircuit Court of Appeals decision in a habeas cor-pus action, which reversed the District Court andheld that the State of Oklahoma was withoutjurisdiction to prosecute and convict a memberof the Muscogee (Creek) Nation because thecrime for which he was accused occurred inIndian country, within the boundaries of theMuscogee (Creek) Reservation. After Mr. Murphywas convicted of murder in Oklahoma State courtand exhausted his appeals, he filed a habeas 
corpus petition in federal district court asserting
that because the crime occurred within theMuscogee (Creek) Nation’s reservation bound-aries, and because he is Indian, the state courthad no jurisdiction. The federal district courtdenied his petition, holding that Oklahoma pos-sessed jurisdiction because the Muscogee (Creek)Reservation was disestablished. On appeal, theTenth Circuit Court of Appeals utilized the three-factor Solem reservation disestablishment analy-sis and not only found that Congress did not dis-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Reservation, butalso that statutes and allotment agreementsshowed that “Congress recognized the existenceof the Creek Nation’s borders.” Likewise, thecourt held that the historical evidence did notindicate a Congressional intent to disestablishthe Muscogee (Creek) reservation, nor a contem-poraneous understanding by Congress that it dis-established the reservation. Accordingly, thecourt concluded that (1) Mr. Murphy’s state con-viction and death sentence were invalid becauseNATIVE AMERICAN RIGHTS FUNDthe crime occurred in Indian Country and the
accused was Indian, (2) the Oklahoma Court ofCriminal Appeals (OCCA) erred by concludingthe state courts had jurisdiction, and (3) the fed-eral district court erred by concluding the OCCA’sdecision was not contrary to clearly establishedfederal law. The parties have asked the Court toadopt an agreed briefing schedule, which wouldset July 23, 2018, as the due date for thePetitioner’s brief. 
Wrapping Up the October 2017 Term
The Court has completed oral arguments for theOctober 2017 Term. It will continue announcingopinions in non-argument sessions throughout
June 2018 and Washington v. U.S. (17-269) (the
“Culverts Case”), which was argued on April 18,2018, will be among those decided before theCourt recesses at the end of June. It will also con-tinue considering petitions for review during itsJune conferences and we anticipate one or moreIndian law petitions will be scheduled for confer-ence in June. However, any petitions granted atthis point will be argued in the October 2018Term.

President Trump’s action to revoke and replacethe Bears Ears National Monument is not only anattack on the five sovereign nations with deep tiesto the Bears Ears region, it is a complete viola-tion of the separation of powers enshrined in ourConstitution. No president has ever revoked andreplaced a national monument before because itis not legal to do so. Only Congress may alter amonument. In light of this blatant violation oflaw, the Native American Rights Fund, represent-ing the Hopi Tribe, Pueblo of Zuni, and UteMountain Ute Tribe filed a lawsuit on December4, 2017, to protect Bears Ears. 
At the end of January, the courts consolidated the
three cases dealing with the Bears Ears monu-ment in to one case and consolidated the twocases addressing Grand Staircase-Escalante in toa separate case. The judge had given the govern-ment until March 16, 2018, to file a response tothe original complaints.In the meantime, the Trump administration
sought to transfer the case to a Utah court. TheTribes filed a motion in opposition to transferringthe case to Utah since the case affects more thanone state’s residents and has nationwide impor-tance. The case is now stayed pending the court’sdecision on transfer.
The lawsuit may take a while to litigate, so NARF
continues to monitor activity on the ground toensure that there is no irreparable harm to thisimportant place. If there is any activity thatwould cause harm, we will ask the court to put astop to it.
On January 16, federal agencies initiated a public
comment process on the issues related to theenvironmental analysis and planning criteria forthe revised monument boundaries.
In legislation, bills were introduced in Congress
to shrink and replace Bears Ears, codifyingPresident Trump’s actions, as well as to expandBears Ears.  The Tribes are unified in support ofthe bills that would expand Bears Ears, and theyunanimously oppose the bills that would shrinkand replace Bears Ears. Tribal representativeshave commented on legislation under considera-tion in Congress.

One of the major
undertakings of theNational Indian LawLibrary (NILL) is theAccess to Tribal LawProject (ATLP). ATLPprovides tribal leaders,legal practitioners, andthe public with conve-nient access to currentand accurate tribal law,which enhances thepower of tribal courtsand strengthens tribalsovereignty.
Access to tribal law—which includes the codes,
constitutions, intergovernmental agreements,and legal opinions of Native governments—strengthens tribal sovereignty and promotesjustice in Indian Country. We work daily to col-lect and make these often elusive documentsavailable to legal researchers.
Locate a Tribe’s Laws
Researchers requiring access to tribal law need look no further than NILL ’s Tribal LawGateway (https://www.narf.org/nill/triballaw/).The Gateway is an alphabetical list of all federallyrecognized tribes in addition to several state-recognized tribes. Each tribe’s page includescontact information for the tribe and their tribalcourt, as well as information related to thetribe’s code, constitution, and court opinions. 
When possible, links are provided to the laws on
the tribe’s website or on the NILL website. Whenthe full-text is not available online, NILL pro-vides a table of contents for materials in ourprint collection. Researchers can use the table 
of contents to identify the specific sections they would like to review and request them via the AskNILL section on our website(https://narf.org/nill/asknill.html).
Identify Tribal Laws on a Topic
Researchers or tribal leaders looking for samplecode provisions also will find the Tribal LawGateway useful. A search box on the Tribal LawGateway page offers the ability to find tribalcodes on any topic. For example, a search for“probate” or “peacemaking” will turn up a vari-ety of codes of interest to someone drafting orcomparing tribal codes on that topic, allowingthem to leverage tribal law rather than state orfederal law as a model. The librarians at NILLcan assist with locating the full-text of codes notavailable online through our AskNILL service.

largest nonprofit law firm defending and promoting the legalrights of Indian people on issues essential to their tribal sover-eignty, their natural resources, and their human rights. NARFempowers individuals and communities whose rights, economicself-sufficiency, and political participation have been eroded orundermined. 
The United States has tried to subjugate and dominate Native
peoples, yet we still exist today as independent quasi-sovereignnations, each having a unique relationship with the federal gov-ernment. Tribes today are governed by a myriad of federaltreaties, statutes, and case law. Yet it is within these laws thatNative Americans place their hope and faith for justice and theprotection of their way of life. 
Since its inception in 1970, NARF has represented over 250
tribes in 31 states in such areas as tribal jurisdiction and recog-nition, land claims, hunting and fishing rights, the protection ofIndian religious freedom, and many others. In addition to greatstrides achieving justice on behalf of Native American people,perhaps NARF’s greatest distinguishing attribute has been itsability to bring high quality, highly ethical legal representationto dispossessed tribes. This legal advocacy continues to play avital role in the survival of tribes and their way of life. NARFstrives to protect the most important rights of Indian peoplewithin the limit of available resources. 
One of the responsibilities of NARF’s first Board of Directors was
to develop priorities to guide the organization in its mission topreserve and enforce the legal rights of Native Americans. Thecommittee developed five priorities that continue to lead NARFtoday:
●Preserve tribal existence
●Protect tribal natural resources
●Promote Native American human rights
●Hold governments accountable to Native Americans
●Develop Indian law and educate the public about Indian rights,
laws, and issues
Under the priority to preserve tribal existence , NARF works to
construct the foundations that are necessary to empower tribesso that they can continue to live according to their Native tradi-tions, to enforce their treaty rights, to insure their independenceon reservations, and to protect their sovereignty. Throughout the process of European conquest and colonization
of North America, Indian tribes experienced a steady diminish-ment of their land base to a mere 2.3 percent of its original size.An adequate land base and control over natural resources arecentral components of economic self-sufficiency and self-deter-mination, and are vital to the very existence of tribes. Thus,much of NARF’s work involves protecting tribal natural
resources. 
Although basic human rights are considered a universal and
inalienable entitlement, Native Americans face the ongoingthreat of having their rights undermined by the United Statesgovernment, states, and others who seek to limit these rights.Under the priority of promoting human rights , NARF strives to
enforce and strengthen laws which are designed to protect therights of Native Americans to practice their traditional religion,to use their own language, and to enjoy their culture. 
Contained within the unique trust relationship between the
United States and Indian nations is the inherent duty for all lev-els of government to recognize and responsibly enforce themany laws and regulations applicable to Indian peoples. Becausesuch laws impact virtually every aspect of tribal life, NARF main-tains its involvement in the legal matters holding governments
accountable to Native Americans.
A commitment to developing Indian law and educate the public
about Indian rights, laws, and issues is essential for the contin-
ued protection of Indian rights. This primarily involves estab-lishing favorable court precedents, distributing information andlaw materials, encouraging and fostering Indian legal education,and forming alliances with Indian law practitioners and otherIndian organizations. 
Requests for legal assistance should be addressed to the
Litigation Management Committee at NARF's main office at1506 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80302. NARF’s clients are expectedto pay what they can toward the costs of legal representation.
